The first time, I asked my husband to get me some ginger from the store because I KNEW the morning sickness would hit any day. Instead I started bleeding almost immediately.

 The next time I told my sisters and a bunch of close friends right away. Boom, chemical pregnancy. 

This time, I had the gall to unpack a bag of maternity clothes given to me by a friend, that have been sitting there for a month because I was too paranoid to touch them for fear of jinxing myself. And today I go in for my 5th? 6th? viability check, only to find that the heart had stopped beating and baby stopped growing about a week ago. 

I should be 9 weeks today. My due date was my daughter's birthday.

My daughter, Autumn, was stillborn due to a cord accident at 33 weeks. That was in July. I don't need to explain how fucking devastated and destroyed this left me, because I know that you guys know this. I think of her beautiful face every day, and I miss her so much it makes my entire body hurt. 

Earlier this month, I found out I was pregnant again. I was so happy I cried, which isn't something I do. I felt like pieces of my heart were starting to come back into place, I felt a warmth that I haven't felt since my daughter was alive inside of me.

Last Saturday, I started bleeding heavily, so my boyfriend drove me to the ER. The whole car ride I was sobbing and just kept saying ""No. No. No. No."" 
At the hospital, they found my baby's heart beat, but the doctor coldly told me ""there's a 50% chance you will miscarry. These things happen."" so I was sent home with my paperwork which detailed my ""threatened miscarriage"" diagnosis and instructions to make an appointment with my OB.

Today I was able to see my baby's heartbeat again, which appears to be perfectly strong. However, the bleeding had come from a subchorionic hemmorhage, which is still there and looks quite large. I also apparently have a bicornuate uterus, which puts me at a higher risk of miscarriage. I don't know why this was never mentioned during my first pregnancy, but whatever. Another thing...my pregnancy hormone levels have dropped. So there I have it, a good heartbeat, paired with a pile of shitty things that shouldn't be happening.
I feel like I'm just waiting to lose this baby, too. I feel so terrified, so sad and let down, so fucking defeated. And if by some miracle I make it to 23 weeks without a miscarriage, that will be wonderful, but I know damn well there's no ""safe"" part of pregnancy. My healthy baby girl died at 33 weeks and there wasn't a single thing I could have done to prevent it. 
I feel so overwhelmed with this, I don't know how I'm going to get through it. In some ways I want reassurance, but I also know that by being optimistic I could very well be setting myself up for deep disappointment and heartbreak. I guess maybe I just want some company and understanding :-\

The 3rd anniversary of my loss is coming up, February 3rd, so I figured, I could introduce myself, and tell my story. 

My father passed away suddenly in July of 2012. I took that loss particularly hard. I was living with him at the time and I found him in his recliner when I came home from working an overnight shift. He was my very best friend. And losing him was one of the hardest things I have gone through. That December, my now ex-husband and I found out we were expecting. I was OVER THE MOON. Naturally, I was upset my dad would miss out on this grandchild, but elated to have someone to love and sort of fill that hole. I was working as a server, the duties were light, nothing that I couldn't handle. During a break one evening, one of my coworkers asked me how I was feeling, was I excited, etc... She was a good friend of mind, so I was completely honest with her. Something about this didn't feel right. I told her that I was fairly certain there would be something wrong with the baby. I was thinking down syndrome or something of that nature. But I was fine with that, and I would love that baby like no other, regardless. A few nights later, on a Saturday, I was finishing up my side work, sweeping under tables, I had one more table of guests left and then I would be going home for the night. I felt a sharp pain and a gush of wetness. I headed to the bathroom and there was a good amount of blood. I was scared to death. I told my boss and she had one of the cooks drive me to the hospital and my ex met me there.

The blood confirmed my levels where not as high as they should have been. They sent me home on bed rest until Monday so I could talk with my doctor. Early the next morning, Sunday, I woke up, coughed, and felt a rush of blood. I went to the bathroom and realized I was losing a lot of blood. I was dizzy and lightheaded and I told my ex, we need to go to the hospital, now. At the hospital, they couldn't stop the bleeding. The doctor told me that it was hard to tell, but I had had a molar pregnancy. They did a D&C. I went home and spent about the next 6 months in a bottle in an attempt to avoid the pain of losing my dad and a baby, that didn't really exist. 

Last year, I was diagnosed with PCOS, which honestly, was a relief. It helped to explain a lot of my hormone issues and kind of gave me closure on why everything happened the way it did. 

At the beginning of this year my SO and I decided to start TTC. We both know it's an uphill battle. I would like to try for a little bit without medical help. It scares me to think there's a strong possibility for another loss, but it would kill me if I didn't try. 

So that's it. Sorry it was kind of long. I've been ""lurking"" for a couple of weeks. It's so bittersweet to have a place like this.

<p>The 3rd anniversary of my loss is coming up, February 3rd, so I figured, I could introduce myself, and tell my story. </p>

<p>My father passed away suddenly in July of 2012. I took that loss particularly hard. I was living with him at the time and I found him in his recliner when I came home from working an overnight shift. He was my very best friend. And losing him was one of the hardest things I have gone through. That December, my now ex-husband and I found out we were expecting. I was OVER THE MOON. Naturally, I was upset my dad would miss out on this grandchild, but elated to have someone to love and sort of fill that hole. I was working as a server, the duties were light, nothing that I couldn&#39;t handle. During a break one evening, one of my coworkers asked me how I was feeling, was I excited, etc... She was a good friend of mind, so I was completely honest with her. Something about this didn&#39;t feel right. I told her that I was fairly certain there would be something wrong with the baby. I was thinking down syndrome or something of that nature. But I was fine with that, and I would love that baby like no other, regardless. A few nights later, on a Saturday, I was finishing up my side work, sweeping under tables, I had one more table of guests left and then I would be going home for the night. I felt a sharp pain and a gush of wetness. I headed to the bathroom and there was a good amount of blood. I was scared to death. I told my boss and she had one of the cooks drive me to the hospital and my ex met me there. After waiting for what seemed like an eternity, they took some blood and did an ultrasound while they were waiting for the blood results. At that point, I should have been about 8 weeks along.

First, a little bit about my first pregnancy. I was 20 years old, going to college full time and cheerleading. I was, for the most part, pretty healthy. I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks 1 day and I miscarried only 17 days later. The whole time I knew about the pregnancy was the most stressful time of my life. My mother told me if I didn't have an abor!ion by the time I hit 9 weeks, I had to move out. My boyfriends (who was 19) told me if I had an abor!ion he would stay with me but if I kept it I was a psychopath. So yes, my pregnancy was miserable. I was beyond stressed and was receiving emotional abuse from my family and the father daily. 

Although I understood than and I understand now that miscarriages happen like 20% of the time, doesn't stop my worrying. 

I was 20 and healthy.. And my body, for lack of better words, failed me. Sorry if that seems insensitive to say, it's just how it felt for me. I felt like my body failed me. I understand I was under intense amount of stress but I just can't stop worrying it's going to happen again.. 

And the worst part of worrying is that's it's like a vicious circle.. The more I obsess- the more I stress- and the more I stress the more likely I am to have a miscarriage which causes me to stress more..

I know no matter how much I google, I'm not going to find any answers if I'm already pregnant or not. And I am definitely not asking if you think I'm pregnant because only a test will tell.. 

But this two week wait is killing me!! 
I had unprotected sex on day 7, ovulated day 10/11, and yesterday (day 18) had a lot of clear-ish discharge that was kinda of liquidy/kinda snot like texture (sorry tmi).. 

I'm praying somehow the sperm survived 4-5 days and I somehow got pregnant. But the chances are so slim and it makes me obsess over it so much more!! I hate not knowing and I hate fearing that if I stress even a little, I'll end up having a miscarriage.. 

I don't know if there was much of a question in there but I just want advice and tips..

My husband and I have been together for nearly 7 years, married for about 1.5. After about a year of marriage we decided to NTNP, and shortly we found ourselves expecting. We were excited and very scared! I felt very cautious in my first trimester and didn't really let myself get too excited until 11 weeks, when we saw the baby via ultrasound and confirmed that the heart was beating and baby was measuring right on track. I had a really rough first trimester, with frequent nausea and vomiting that didn't completely go away in the second tri. Other than that, though, things seemed to be going really well.

At 20 weeks, 6 days, we went for baby's anatomy scan. I had heard the heartbeat at the doctor's office at 19 weeks so I had no reason to suspect anything might be even remotely wrong. I hadn't really felt the baby move in the last two or three days, but I figured that was pretty normal for that stage of gestation and that the baby was probably just moving when I was walking around or sleeping or whatever. We were excited to see the baby again and hopefully find out the gender. Instead, the ultrasound tech turned off the machine after about 10 minutes and told me she'd be right back. 20 minutes later, she returned and said to go right to the hospital and my doctor would meet us there. Soon after arriving, my doctor took us into a small room and told us that, sadly, the baby had died. There was no heartbeat or sign of movement, and there were a couple of other indications that the baby was gone. Even though I was just about 21 weeks, it looked like the baby had stopped growing at 18 weeks, even if he had continued living for a while after that. There was no indication of what had gone wrong, though she emphasized it was nothing I had done and there was nothing I could do to prevent it.

I spent the next three days in the hospital. I was induced with Cervidil (a loooong, slooooow process) and eventually switched to Cytotec. About an hour and a half after the Cytotec was inserted, I delivered our stillborn son. We named him Isaac. He was so beautiful. We were able to spend a whole day holding him and looking at him until we had to give him up, and we have some beautiful mementos of our time there. We are still waiting for the results of the autopsy that may reveal to us why he passed away, though no matter what the autopsy tells us, I feel in my heart that this was just a random, terrible event that could have happened to anyone.

We had family surrounding us in the week before and the week after the funeral, and I will be returning to work on February 1. There are two things keeping me moving forward right now: one, that we will be moving back to our hometown soon, which we had already planned to do before the baby arrived in May. And two, to look forward to the next pregnancy. DH and I are both scared--how could we not be? But we want a baby in our arms so badly. Currently I'm still dealing with spotting. The plan is to wait to TTC until I've completed a couple of normal cycles, and/or until we've moved, so I can have consistent care with one doctor. We'll see what happens.

I've posted here and there in which I mentioned my story a little bit and been lurking for almost since the beginning of of this sub, but I've been putting off a formal introduction for quite some time because admitting it publicly is still very very painful for me..so here goes nothing. 

November 2014 was when Connor was born. He fought for his life for approximately 12 hours before passing peacefully in my arms. He was overdue at 42+2 but I was very adamant about the whole natural birth experience...no drugs, birth center, midwife, etc. Afterall, I had a perfect ""textbook"" pregnancy, and what's to fear? I was a perfectly healthy person, we had done several NSTs and biophysical profiles, and he looked fine on the u/s. My midwife was okay with me not inducing and letting him come natraully. I went into labor naturally the evening before and it progressed naturally throughout the night and during the day. We went to the birth center about 2pm the following day. Everything was going fine until about 2 hours after I was admitting to my birth center when his heart rate spiked significantly. My water had broken and there was a large amount of meconium in it. I was rushed to the ER at the hospital at which the doctor that my midwife practices with practices. Less than an hour after admission, an emergecy c-section was performed and Connor was born! My midwife had warned me that since there was meconium in the water they will have to take him to the NICU for observation immediately. He had normal-ish APGAR scores of 6-7. Everything seemed well so my midwife left for the evening. My baby was intubated. Well as luck would have it, not only was he having respiratory issues, but his blood was completely septic with group B strep, which was discovered later in the evening. This bacteria completely weakened his organs and he just did not have enough lung and heart capacity to fight off the infection, let alone breathe. This was a complete shock to everyone as I tested group B strep negative only a few weeks prior. They gave him antibiotics right away but it would be too late. Seeing him hooked up to all the tubes was heartbreaking. My gut already feared the worst but my mind kept on telling me he could fight though it, he will make it through. Then the worst day of my life happened - the neonatologist came in and told me that it was time to spend our last moments with Connor. She said that they had to resusitate him twice already and his heart most likely won't survive another attempt. It was only the kind thing to do to let him go naturally. We had to make the most painful choice of our lives to let him off life support, and I finally got to hold my baby and held him next to my skin... Then his daddy held him and we cried and cried but told him it was okay for him to go. He was perfect in every way. He had all his fingers and toes and was a plump baby with his daddy's eyes and my nose and his daddy's mouth. He had fine, wispy hair that was slightly curly, just like mine. We bathed him gently and dressed him. It was very peaceful. The nurses were great and took lots of pictures of the entire process, and we treasure those pictures very much. Then it was time to make the difficult calls to the grandparents for them to say goodbye. When they came he was already cooling off - his lips and fingers were no longer rosy. 

All the medical professionals - my midwife, the doctor that works with her, the OBs that performed the surgery on me, Connor's pediatrician - were baffled. The neonatologist said she had only seen 4 cases in the last 10 years of practice in which a baby was born group B strep positive to a mom that tested negative. Of those 4 cases, 3 babies died. She said it must've been a especially virulent strain. Now I know GBS can cause false negatives - since the bacteria lives in the flora of the digestive tract, it can still travel to the colon to the vagina and up to the uterus at a later time. GBS can also cross membranes and cause miscarriages and stillbirths, but most of the time babies contract it during labor. On Connor's death certificate it said that the main cause of death was chorioamnioitis caused by group B strep. I had no discernable signs of chorio or any infection until AFTER labor in which I had a 103 deg fever. 

To this day - I wonder why this happened to me, to my sweet Connor. Why didn't they take my life instead of his? What if I had gone to a doctor instead of a midwife? What if I had gotten induced earlier at 41 weeks, which was what the doctor recommended? I'm pregnant again with Connor's sister, and she's 14 weeks today. She is a wiggly little baby, and it's bittersweet. Every day I live in fear that something bad will happen to her, that I will disappoint the family again by coming home with empty arms.

40,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi guys. I've been reading this sub lately and unfortunately I'm part of this group now - although I'm so happy and grateful this group exists. I wanted to share my story. I needed to get it out, so it turned out long - apologies in advance.. 

Almost a month ago we heard there was something probably wrong, with an enlarged NT at the 12 week scan. Three weeks ago we heard it was trisomy 18 and our LO didn’t have a chance. And two weeks ago I got induced and gave birth to our LO at 14 weeks gestation.

When we got our results of the bloodwork and scan combined, the floor was pulled from underneath me and I just knew this wasn't going to end well. Chances were 1 in 5 that it would be bad. I started doing my research (coping mechanism) and try to mentally prepare for what was coming. A week and a cvs later we heard it was trisomy 18. And that LO was a girl (we asked, we just wanted to know at that point – enough surprises already). 

We knew immediately that we would terminate the pregnancy, we would lose our daughter regardless and losing her after letting her suffer was something we couldn't do. So we started to prepare. She would be born at 14 weeks. 

We decided to give her the name we had planned for a girl – Kate. We are Dutch, but both my SO and I have English roots (and English names ourselves) so we wanted it to be an English name. I found a place to bury her. We made a wooden box for her, we lined it with a beautiful fabric, I made drawings for her, I made her a little blanky that contained part of my comfort-blanky from when I was little. My mom made her a tiny hat and last of all I wrote her a letter. 

I started cramping from the primer medication and went in to hospital a day early, and they decided to not wait and induce me. I wanted that too – I just wanted Kate to come and have her peace. Delivery was horrible. The medication had a such a strong effect on me, contractions were back to back with no letting up. I couldn’t think, talk, breathe, have a sip of water – I just was pain. (You should know my country has a very natural-birth-no-pain-medication-culture). I asked for an epi 1,5 hours in, it took another hour to actually get it. That might be the worst hour of my life. I just couldn’t cope with the pain anymore, couldn’t cope with the fact that there wouldn’t be a healthy baby at the end of it, couldn’t cope with the fact we were in fact losing Kate, at that very fucking moment, losing her; not protecting her, not keeping her safe in my womb, but getting her out. 

When the epi kicked in, everything relaxed. My water broke. I was so relieved to not be in such hellish pain anymore. And two hours later, she was there. 

She was so tiny. My SO cut the cord, which was also tiny… she barely made it out, it wasn’t that long yet.  The nurse put her on my belly, and we just looked at her. We were in awe. We were so moved, so touched, that this was our poor little Kate. I thought she was beautiful. I could have looked at her for days. (Now I still yearn to look at her without it to end…).

My mom, my SO’s father and stepmom came to the hospital and they saw Kate too. They wanted to, and we wanted them to feel free to come and say their goodbyes to their first grandchild. I’m very happy they saw her, that she is as real to them as she is to us. 

After that I had to go into surgery to remove my placenta, it didn’t come out on its own. When I came to, we wrapped Kate in her little blanky, we laid her down in her box, we put all the things meant for her in the box to go with her. We decided to close the box, never to be opened again.

I was released from hospital the day after Kate was born, and we buried her the day after that. It was raining and the sun was shining, there was a rainbow when we drove out of our street (I am not making this up, I promise…). We buried her in the presence of our parents and dearest friends. My SO read part of the letter to Kate. I was so proud of him, that he was able to do that. 

It felt like such a relief to throw the earth on her little box, I can’t really explain it but I just wanted to shove all of the dirt that was there over her in one go, in one giant, middle-eastern-style swoop of my whole body. I didn’t though. But the relief was there: now we did everything we could for her. We have had a very short time with her, a short time as parents, and in that time we did everything we could, we gave everything there was time for to give. 

Now, after the funeral there is only feeling left. Feeling my body ache for her. Feeling like a wounded animal, looking for its missing limb. There is so much sadness, so much grief, so much crying and so, so much missing Kate. So much more to give, but no Kate to give it to. 

My SO is a rock. He is there for me, in a way I can’t be for him at the moment.  I hope I’ll be able to be there for him when he needs me like I need him now. My employer is totally supportive and fantastic, they send me flowers and they’re not pressuring me at all. Our closest friends brought us food the first week… My boobs didn’t start leaking… For all that I feel blessed. And I feel blessed we could spare Kate pain, discomfort and trauma.

Last week I had an appointment and went into town for the first time since. My jeans buttoned up again, and that made me feel like someone punched me in the stomach. I stood on the ferry (we live near a river) and all I could think was: I’ll never be able to show Kate this. It was so, so sad. Being outside of the house for the first time was a big reality check. This is going to take so much time.

I’m not ready to ttc again, even though I think my body just wants to get pregnant like RIGHT NOW (so weird to be horny and grieving). But I’m not ready. I’m afraid we’ll never conceive again, or that it is hereditary (we’ll know end of February). 

I’m trying to take it day by day, make sure to get out of bed, shower, walk the dog and eat (at least some) healthy food (combined with all the junk I’m craving!). Any advice or words of wisdom are welcome. It is hard for me to trust I’ll get through this, although rationally I know I probably will.

So I am 34F and have been married for around 9 months, no children. Our TTC story so far is that we started trying after the wedding as soon as my cycles started to regulate after being on the pill for something crazy like 15 years, this took about 6 months. Acupuncture really helped actually. Anyway we got our bfp in October! After I got my head around the whole 'our lives will never be the same' thing, we were excited! Had our 7w ultrasound and everything was perfect (picture of our little blob is attached) - hearing the heartbeat was amazing. Fast forward to Christmas, I had gone interstate to see family and cramping starts as soon as I'm on the plane. Continues and then the spotting starts. You know the story. Ended up getting an ultrasound which confirmed the worst. DH was still at home, due to work commitments he was coming over a few days later, so felt really alone at this point. Ended up having a D&C Christmas Eve, which is a whole other story on its own (surgery delayed due to a fire in the hospital affecting theatre, and numerous other things that I guess in retrospect are kind of amusing). Recovery has been good. Now I'm in the awful wait time and have no idea when AF will show. 
Emotionally I am doing much better, I did go a bit crazy there for a while though. But even so, I'm not sure I'm ready to start TTC next cycle. I am feeling the pressure though due to my age. As everyone suggests, 35 is some magic age where things need to happen by or we're doomed (ok I know that is an exaggeration!). 
Anyway sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading. :)

Now.. to make things more complicated, our miscarriage happened on *drumroll* Valentine's day. Thanks life. So as the holiday/birthday gets closer, I now have to take into consideration the fact that the date is now also the anniversary of our loss.

<p>EDIT2: Guys, I totally just booked a photography session with a super nice girl with a new photography business and awesome photos. I&#39;m super excited now! Fingers crossed my husband won&#39;t be pouty for this..he&#39;s not crazy about pictures, but I know it&#39;ll be so worth it. Hahah</p>

I'm posting about what I'm going through in hopes of starting a discussion with others who have been through this. Feel free to add to the convo if you are currently pregnant (and hooray for rainbow babies!) 

I found out a week ago that my miscarriage was incomplete due to a missed ectopic pregnancy. I was treated last Friday with methotrexate. From what I have found, I will be required to wait to TTC for about three months to get out of the risk of birth defects from the MTX. I'm asking for confirmation tomorrow when I finally get the chance to meet with an OB.

Like so many others here, I assumed the way I would get through this miscarriage would be to get back on the horse and try again for another baby. That concept gave me a lot of hope and realizing that it's highly unlikely I will be pregnant by the time my due date rolls around is just so sad. The fact is - I'm not having a baby in 2016 anymore, and that just... It's just very hard for me to wrap my head around that. I assumed I would have a miscarriage, get a period, and press forward. Not have a 4+ week long miscarriage ordeal and then be told oh by the way, you need to prevent pregnancy for the next three cycles.

My husband, who hasn't shown much emotion in any of this, suggested to me that we should simply shift our focus to getting healthy, working toward getting back into better shape, and spending quality time with our daughter. His coping mechanism is to not deal with emotions - he's basically acting like this didn't happen to him, it happened to me. And while he's right that doing positive things will only benefit us, that is a hard thing for me to consider. I AM determined to use this time wisely, but I didn't WANT this time. I'm also entering therapy and hoping that will help, too.

I was SO ready for a baby (we conceived on cycle 13 this time, our daughter took 11 cycles) and so excited. Now I feel like I have NOTHING to look forward to, with friends all around me pregnant and due this year.

In light of this news, I thought it might help me to hear from others on what you have done to get through this. 

EDIT: I didn't see the post from yesterday talking about not being a mother in 2016 until I posted this one. Sorry if it sounds like a repeat, I didn't mean for it to.

I was lucky in that a doctor who comes to my town twice a month had an opening soon after I made the call. My appointment was at noon yesterday. It was in an office that's shared with a local doctor. I didn't pay attention to the name over the door or the specialty, but it's something reproductive, also. Only one woman came in for him and she and she had some sort of lab results to turn in. The walls were covered in baby and young family pictures. From what I gather over at /r/infertility, this is depressingly common. They want to show you their finished product, no matter how sensitive you are to it.

My office didn't have a no children rule. One couple that was there before I showed had three small children with them, ages 1, 2, and 3. They were very clear that they were daycare children when I asked their ages, and said they wouldn't be here if they had one or three of their own already. There was another young woman there, I'd guess mid 20's, before I got there. We got called back in the order we showed up. I didn't get seen until 12:45, which kind of sucked, but I get that the doctor's busy.

The nurse came in first and introduced herself and got all my paperwork. She asked me a few question about my previous loss and whether I've taken fertility drugs before or had any tests done. She was incredibly nice and sympathetic about my previous loss. She seemed impressed that I knew what an HSG was and had been charting for months. I guess they don't normally get women who are well prepared on their first visit and fully expect to explain everything necessary.

I had a few minutes alone while the doc finished with the couple with kids, then he came in to see us. He asked me some questions, some the same as the nurse but mostly different. He asked if my OB/GYN that referred me (after me basically asking for a referral) thought I was ovulating on my own and I showed him my printed charts. He glanced through to verify I was ovulating monthly then kind of scrunched up his face and said 'Do you enjoy tracking all this?' like he totally expected me to say it was a burden. My SO started laughing. I mentioned that I'm a Data Analyst with a background in statistics and love getting the numbers while my SO helpfully added that I was excited when I realized I could do our taxes soon. He used that to gently poke fun at me for the rest of the appointment. 

He was also sympathetic to my loss. He explained that once I do get pregnant, he'll monitor me for the first few weeks and make sure it's where it should be before sending me back to my OB/GYN. I'm really grateful for that. The thought of another tubal terrifies me enough that I waited 7 years before being willing to try again.

He said we need to get more data before we could look at possible treatments (which I expected) and said he wanted to check my AMH levels that day. This is a measure that typically correlates to remaining egg quantity and can be taken from a blood sample any day of your cycle. He said once I started bleeding (which I have within the past hour) to call and schedule an HSG and a semen analysis between CD5 and CD12 at his main office, an hour away. The HSG is this fun little procedure where they stick a catheter through your cervix and shoot dye into your uterus to see its shape and whether or not your tubes are open. If we do the semen analysis at the same time, doc can give us both results at once immediately afterwards and my SO can drive me home since I probably won't be in any condition to drive myself.

I asked about CD3 and CD21 blood work. CD3 blood work typically tests for FSH, which can be a different way to check for ovarian reserve (eggs remaining in your body) or for egg quality. CD21 checks progesterone. He said he's not going to worry about either of those this cycle, which is fine. From what I've heard, FSH can vary and isn't important unless you're doing something in a particular cycle and I'm already on progesterone supplements so we have a pretty good idea that my CD21 test will come back low.

That was about it. He sent me back out to the lobby until the phlebotomist was ready to take my blood to check the AMH and his nurse gave us a sheet on the HSG. I like him, which is good, but we won't know any more until we get the tests done and the results back.

<p>I had a few minutes alone while the doc finished with the couple with kids, then he came in to see us. He asked me some questions, some the same as the nurse but mostly different. He asked if my OB/GYN that referred me (after me basically asking for a referral) thought I was ovulating on my own and I showed him my printed charts. He glanced through to verify I was ovulating monthly then kind of scrunched up his face and said &#39;Do you enjoy tracking all this?&#39; like he totally expected me to say it was a burden. My SO started laughing. I mentioned that I&#39;m a Data Analyst with a background in statistics and love getting the numbers while my SO helpfully added that I was excited when I realized I could do our taxes soon. He used that to gently poke fun at me for the rest of the appointment. </p>

<p>He was also sympathetic to my loss. He explained that once I do get pregnant, he&#39;ll monitor me for the first few weeks and make sure it&#39;s where it should be before sending me back to my OB/GYN. I&#39;m really grateful for that. The thought of another tubal terrifies me enough that I waited 7 years before being willing to try again.</p>

<p>He said we need to get more data before we could look at possible treatments (which I expected) and said he wanted to check my AMH levels that day. This is a measure that typically correlates to remaining egg quantity and can be taken from a blood sample any day of your cycle. He said once I started bleeding (which I have within the past hour) to call and schedule an HSG and a semen analysis between CD5 and CD12 at his main office, an hour away. The HSG is this fun little procedure where they stick a catheter through your cervix and shoot dye into your uterus to see its shape and whether or not your tubes are open. If we do the semen analysis at the same time, doc can give us both results at once immediately afterwards and my SO can drive me home since I probably won&#39;t be in any condition to drive myself.</p>

<p>I asked about CD3 and CD21 blood work. CD3 blood work typically tests for FSH, which can be a different way to check for ovarian reserve (eggs remaining in your body) or for egg quality. CD21 checks progesterone. He said he&#39;s not going to worry about either of those this cycle, which is fine. From what I&#39;ve heard, FSH can vary and isn&#39;t important unless you&#39;re doing something in a particular cycle and I&#39;m already on progesterone supplements so we have a pretty good idea that my CD21 test will come back low.</p>

<p>That was about it. He sent me back out to the lobby until the phlebotomist was ready to take my blood to check the AMH and his nurse gave us a sheet on the HSG. I like him, which is good, but we won&#39;t know any more until we get the tests done and the results back.</p>

<p>Please feel free to ask any questions. I&#39;ve tried to be as detailed as possible because that&#39;s what makes me feel better when I&#39;m looking into something.</p>

I posted about the details in he daily thread back on the 16th (https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/417bx0/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_january/)

After receiving the injections on Friday afternoon, I was told by the nurse to expect my mouth to be sore and to possibly be nauseous. Saturday morning, I woke up with both issues and I spent most of the day with pretty substantial nausea (think morning sickness style, all day nausea). Sunday, the sore mouth was less but still not feeling that great. Today, more nausea.My cyst pain (they found a cyst in my left ovary) has increased but it's manageable. This is the first time I've had one to my knowledge.

Thing is, I was expecting this to cause some sort of bleeding. My discharge/bleeding had basically stopped around the middle of last week, before this injection. I'm not bleeding or having more than a swipe of slight color on the tissue from time to time.

My doctor's office is closed for the MLK holiday - and someone must have forgotten to turn on the answering service, because it simply rings and rings, no way to get to an on-call doctor. It's not urgent and I have an HCG draw tomorrow, but I wondered if anyone here had anything anecdotal to add while I wait another day.

My husband and I were shocked (and ecstatic) to learn that we were pregnant this past fall. The weeks clicked on, and we became more and more excited to be parents in the spring (what a fun adventure!). We were geared up for the big 20 week ultrasound, and as soon as our little baby was up on the screen the mood in the room changed. It seems that our baby had fatal developmental problems (a wide range), and the doctors were certain the baby would not make it to term. We were shocked (we had already done 3 ultrasounds-- why is this a surprise? What is going on?! etc). The week that followed was full of frenzied panic, sadness and confusion. At 5 months I was induced by a team of doctors that completed a thorough physical exam on our baby and take samples to try and determine a diagnosis of the problems and the likelihood of this happening again in future pregnancies. After a day and a half in the hospital I gave birth to a stillborn baby boy who I got to see and spend some time with. I feel lucky to have been his mom, even if it was only for 5 months. 
The whole experience was horrible...it's hard to even describe the sadness associated with this kind of loss. I know there are people in this community that understand this. Besides the emotional hardship that came with this, the process of being induced at the hospital was pretty terrible (blown veins, 8 failed IV attempts, a poorly-timed-therefore-ineffective epidural). Honestly the hospital experience is nothing compared to the emptiness/disappointment we feel at our loss.

My husband and I started officially trying for #1 in late August and we were lucky to conceive in October. I had pretty terrible morning sickness starting at week 6 with no spotting or cramping, so I was optimistic that everything was ok. During my ultrasound at 9+2 the midwife said there wasn't a heartbeat and the baby stopped growing at 7+4. I also had blood work completed on the day of the ultrasound and had an HCG level of 104,000 and Progesterone level of 13. 

I had a D&C 4 days later. The procedure seemed to go well although the doctor told my husband that there was more ""products"" than he expected, so he had to do more scraping and said that my bleeding might last the full 2 weeks. I had very minimal spotting and cramping for 3 days after the procedure, followed by 5 days of bleeding with tissue. I had very minimal brown spotting through the next week. 

I continued to use the pregnancy tests to confirm that my HCG level was decreasing, which it appeared to be doing so, but I still had a very faint positive on an FRER 3 weeks and 5 days after my D&C. I got my period - I think - exactly 4 weeks after the D&C. There did appear to be a bit of tissue and it seemed a bit lighter than my previous periods. I had a follow-up appointment with my midwife a couple days later who thought it was my period based on timing and a physical exam, but ordered blood tests to confirm. My HCG level came back at 6.3, so I came back for another blood test a week later and it was only down to 3.8. My midwife recommended that I come in again next week for another blood test and continue to hold off on trying, which was heartbreaking to hear since we wanted to try right away.

So my question is, have any of you had HCG levels so long after the D&C? I asked for an ultrasound this Friday to see if there were any retained products, but my midwife pushed for just a blood test, so I'm thinking of getting a second opinion. Also, I started temping this cycle for the first time and expected to ovulate around this time with my normal 28 day cycles, but the OPKs are still negative and I've only seen a small bit of fertile cervical fluid.

97,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi guys. Last Wednesday, Jan 6th, my worst fear was realized. I woke up feeling awful and ended the day in the ER getting prepped for emergency surgery. Prior to that, I didn't know I was pregnant and wasn't trying to get pregnant. I had had a Mirena IUD and am still breastfeeding my 20 mo old.

The surgery went really well. My ovary and tube were both fine and didn't need to be removed. I lost a lot of blood and had to stay in the hospital for 2 days. I'm home now resting. I took this whole week off to recover. My husband stayed home with me for the first couple of days, but he's back at work now. 

I'm physically feeling so much better, but emotionally I'm feeling pretty crappy. I feel like I caused this pregnancy to happen. Even though I had an IUD and wasn't TTC, I really wanted to be pregnant. My good friend found out she was pregnant with her second in early December, and I was so jealous.

I'm also furious and disgusted with the OB/GYN. I went to go see Dr. E (who is not my usual OB, but the only who had appointments for 2 weeks), on December 22nd. I had been experiencing bleeding and cramping and pain during sex that was sudden onset and really unusual for me. I was told it was just my period returning, and normal, and can totally happen with an IUD. I felt silly for wasting her time. 

When I went to the ER last Wednesday, guess who was on-call? Dr. E. I was so upset. I begged the ER doctor to find someone, ANYONE, else to do the surgery. But she couldn't wait for another doctor. It was all I could do not to scream at Dr. E. I asked her if she remembered seeing me two weeks ago and she said, ""oh yes,"" and then went back to entering stuff in the computer. I never want to see that woman again as long as I live.

I also feel so stupid for not recognizing the signs earlier. If only I took a pregnancy test when I felt like something was off. If only I went straight to the ER on Wednesday instead of pretending everything was ok. If only I had made an appointment with my regular OB/GYN. He would have listened to me.

Anyway, thank you for reading. My family, friends, and co-workers have all been very supportive. But I still needed to get this out.

*12/23: Should have been between 6w5d and 7w4d, US showed a sac measuring 5w3d (which was still technically possible/viable due to my cycle


*12/24: HCG test, 3022 - again, matched a possible viable pregnancy for 5w3d


*12/26: HCG Test, did not receive the results (holiday/weekend)


*12/27: Began cramping and spotting. Called on-call doctor, who gave me HCG results from 26th - 4020. Not doubling, but she saw upward trend and said not to be overly concerned until I got test 3. Recommended that I test my HCG and progesterone in the morning.


*12/28: Ran both tests. HCG came in at 6431, they said not to be concerned (again) about the spotting). Progesterone came in at 4.5 and I had to FIGHT them like hell to give me a prescription that night, which they did. Started first dose (double dose, orally) that evening.


*12/29: Bleeding worsened, checked cervix, low soft and open. 


*12/30: Finally got in to see a nurse in person. She said it was likely based on all of the above and the continued bleeding (not spotting) that I was miscarrying. Major cramping and passed small clots, under size of dime.


*12/31: Ultrasound confirmed miscarriage was 'complete' and no evidence of pregnancy. Still bleeding.


*1/2: Woke up exhausted, cramps were very bad, passed a large clot and cramped passed additional smaller clots throughout the day. I felt that my body basically was done after this.

I was however having morning sickness between 12/21 and 1/6. It's subsided now.

My bleeding has been gradually less and my cramps as well. Bleeding was all but gone when I had my HCG run on 1/7. HCG came in at 1700 and I was notified last Friday that they feel it should have been much lower, and have concerns about retained tissue at this point. I'm still bleeding now, but it is slower and less extreme. 

I'm being told now that they may want me to do the medication to process my miscarriage and get rid of any potential for remaining tissue. 

Does anyone know what my options are here? Has anyone miscarried naturally and then had still high HCG like this?

I'm awaiting a call from the OB today but want to give some thought to what choice I may have. I've learned through this process that I'm my only true advocate.

Before my MC, my cycle was exactly 28 days on the dot, no variations. I got my first AF after 44 days from the day of the MC. I was assuming my cycle would go back to ""normal"" after that, but I guess I'm wrong!

I'm currently on CD31 with no signs of AF but also got a BFN when I tested this morning. Is it normal for my cycle to be longer than it was before? I'm hoping it's not another 44 day cycle! I don't temp, but I could definitely tell I ovulated on time (CD14).
