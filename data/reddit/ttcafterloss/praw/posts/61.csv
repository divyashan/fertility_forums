Hi, I am 34yo and had a full term baby via c/s in January of this year. I don't have any other children. My pregnancy was basically normal, aside from a few small issues no one was particularly worried about. My son was born on 1/5 but wasn't eating well and became hypoglycemic and thus went to the ICU. He slept all the time, wouldn't eat, and his heart rate fluctuated on the monitor. Long story short, he eventually was hooked up to and EEG and we discovered he was having nonconvulsive seizures every two minutes. Over the next several days med after med was added on with no improvement. A neonatal neurologist told us that he very likely had a mutation in a gene that coded for one of his ion channels and that he would be unlikely to ever have any quality of life or even one seizure free day. We withdrew care and he died on 1/14. Many many weeks later testing finally came back that did confirm a mutation.

Life has been horrible since then, but I am doing a little better as time goes on. Nothing I ever feel now compares to the acute grief the first six weeks held. I went back to work at the end of April and am lucky to be very close to my parents, siblings, and a couple friends who all live nearby.

Recently I have been struggling with issues with my extended family. Unfortunately (for me), I have a cousin who was pregnant at the same time as me. She had her daughter in October so she was about three months old when my son died. My extended family gets together a couple of times a month and thus I saw her pretty regularly and we were pretty good friends. She wasn't in the friend circle closest to me, but probably the next one out. Also relevant, I have an aunt who never had any children who is kind of like the family matriarch now that my GPs have died and she and I historically have been very close. She considers all the nieces/nephews like her surrogate children and babysits my cousin's baby once a week.

The week my son died my cousin was sending me snapchats of her baby. As in, during his funeral I got one with a filter of the baby wearing sunglasses and said ""First day of daycare!!"". Etc. I felt this was EXTREMELY insensitive but also thought she was probably just an idiot and not malicious, so I blocked her on every form of social media. Her baby also had to be admitted to the hospital in Feb with the flu; she was there for <24hrs. Upon discharge my aunt sent me a pic of her that said ""All better, going home!"" in a group text with a few other people. I responded and told her it was extremely hard for me to get messages like that and she said ""Sorry, I meant to send that to your mom"". Bullshit. At least give me a real apology.

Anyway, that was all a while ago and things with them have been on the back burner. Until last weekend, when I had them over for my mom's bday. Despite the fact that it's been more six months since my son died, I've only seen my cousin three times and had never talked to her about it (by my choice, I had been avoiding her). That evening we were alone and she started asking me about the details, how was I doing, what ended up happening with the genetic testing, do you want to try to conceive again, etc. While at first we were having a normal convo, halfway through, she started looking at her phone, texting her friends, clearly not listening. At one point I just stopped talking and she didn't even notice. I got up and started washing dishes. Her husband (who never said a word to me after my son's death and who I saw for the first time that night) came up to me and said ""Well, do you blame yourself?"". I was so appalled that he thought that was ok to ask I think I just looked at him and said.....""why would I???""

The next day I was really upset. Somehow my interactions with them brought everything to the surface again. Like, they couldn't even act like they gave a fuck. Must be nice to not have a care in the world and be able to go home to your healthy baby at the end of the night.

Yesterday my aunt texted me:

Aunt: When are you free for dinner with Cousin/Cousin's husband in August?

Me: I'm not sure when I am free yet. To be honest I don't really feel up to getting dinner with them, they stress me out. Let me know if you want to get dinner sometime just us or with my parents""

Aunt: I need my stuff back by the end of the month \[she had lent me a couple things for my mom's bday\]

What the fuck?!?! Didn't ask how I was doing or validate my feelings. This is someone who in the past has been like a second mother to me. Normal me would just try to ignore them. And actually typing it out makes it seem like in my head I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but I am really upset about what's transpired over the past week. It makes me feel so isolated, like most people will never be able to sympathize with me. Like my grief isn't on their time table and that's my fault. I can't even think about the fact that my cousin has a baby without falling into this anxiety ridden angry grief spiral that takes me like an hour to get out of.

I'm not seeing my therapist again for a couple of weeks. She's been encouraging me to try to find an in person or online support system. I thought you guys have probably experienced similar things with family. Am I being crazy? Would you guys feel the same way? Thanks for listening <3

**EDIT**: Thank you everyone for all of your responses and the validation. I've read them all at least three times and will probably read them several more times too. Also, LOL at ""Those people can all go suck a bag of rancid dicks"". I hope everyone here is doing ok.

I haven't even begun to process. I am going through absorbing an ectopic pregnancy right now, currently 2 days post methotrexate injection. I don't even know if I'm grieving yet or just in shock due to being in this precarious situation - not knowing if the injection will work. Not knowing if I'll have to face a life-threatening rupture. The pain in my side is a constant reminder that this little potential human is being dismantled as I type. 

I was so obsessed about this pregnancy - like I could think of nothing else for an entire month. Found concentrating on anything else to be very hard, and my hormones were all over the place. The anxiety dreams and daytime sob-fests were unusual compared to my first pregnancy. Things were not right, but I was actually afraid I was having twins more than anything, due to the extreme nature of the pregnancy symptoms. So I was not expecting this. 

I am also worried that I have scarring in my right Fallopian tube. I came uncomfortably close to death last year after a ruptured appendix caused widespread inflammation and ultimately an infection of the uterus, spent a week in the ICU. Two OB's so far have reassured me that my reproductive system should not have any scarring from that, but I'm paranoid now, since this ectopic occurred on the appendix side. This ectopic is freaking me out due to the similarities to last year's traumatic experience (things rupturing inside of me).

Will probably try to get a free consult with an RE at some point, as soon as I'm emotionally ready. The posts I've read are all so inspirational, I see so much hope in the face of trauma and devastating losses.

However, I get a lot of people who assume that I will be upset when people around me get pregnant. At one point, yes, it was hard. But I don't know how to explain that I want my baby, not someone else's, and when they ask if I'm upset that so-and-so is pregnant, it makes it sound like I think I lost my son because of some weird check and balance on pregnancy and childbirth.

Here's the thing, I never really liked kids or pregnancy before my son. I still don't like kids that much. I want my own children. I babysat my niece and nephew last night, and while it went fine, I just don't get a lot of joy out of the situation. I never have.

On the other hand, the reason I get upset around pregnant people isn't usually that they're pregnant, it's how whiny and annoying a lot of my friends and family get! I have a neighbor who complains every day about how annoying pregnancy is. Great, but you know, some people would still trade you. I have a hard time with a lot of whining because it sets off my anxiety, so my issue isn't that they're pregnant, it's that I feel like they're just looking for sympathy, and I'm not good at that. Especially when it's sympathy about the symptoms of something I'm actively working on achieving. I know not every pregnant person is whiny and looking for sympathy, but that seems to be all I've encountered lately. 

So how do I explain this to people? I don't want to sound petty, or whiny myself. I know I struggle around people who smoke, so I don't seek out or actively try to spend time with smokers. Why is it a problem when it's children or a pregnant person? I had a stillbirth - it's something I'm learning to accept and live with.

Here's my backstory: I discovered I'd had a missed miscarriage in March at what was supposed to be my 8 week dating ultrasound. I think it was a blighted ovum, although no one really said that to me.  I was alone at the ultrasound, and oh-so-sick with first trimester symptoms. It was an awful, nightmarish experience; it had been a long-awaited, planned pregnancy. I had a D&C the next day. We have a 4.5 year old, and I guess I just imagined having kids closer together. After my miscarriage experience, I have realized life can't be planned out as I thought it could be.

My miscarriage occurred two months after my aunt died, and then three weeks after the miscarriage, my cat was attacked by a dog, and left on our sidewalk (dead). Also, I am in school to be a FNP, and am in my last semester at clinical. One of my rotations this semester is at the local Planned Parenthood. It has been so horrendously difficult to be there. I don't want to start a political discussion, but in short - in concept I support a woman's right to choose, in reality, 2 month's post-miscarriage, I am not sure I can be a witness to that choice.

Here&#39;s my backstory: I discovered I&#39;d had a missed miscarriage in March at what was supposed to be my 8 week dating ultrasound. I think it was a blighted ovum, although no one really said that to me.  I was alone at the ultrasound, and oh-so-sick with first trimester symptoms. It was an awful, nightmarish experience; it had been a long-awaited, planned pregnancy. I had a D&amp;C the next day. We have a 4.5 year old, and I guess I just imagined having kids closer together. After my miscarriage experience, I have realized life can&#39;t be planned out as I thought it could be.</p>

<p>My miscarriage occurred two months after my aunt died, and then three weeks after the miscarriage, my cat was attacked by a dog, and left on our sidewalk (dead). Also, I am in school to be a FNP, and am in my last semester at clinical. One of my rotations this semester is at the local Planned Parenthood. It has been so horrendously difficult to be there. I don&#39;t want to start a political discussion, but in short - in concept I support a woman&#39;s right to choose, in reality, 2 month&#39;s post-miscarriage, I am not sure I can be a witness to that choice. It has been an enormous struggle every week, and I have 5 left in the semester. I&#39;d like to drop out early (of clinical, not school), but I am also learning really valuable skills like IUD management.

Apparently my family felt I was showing symptoms but I wasn't late yet. I was apparently irritable and had no patience but everyone chalked up to PMS until it never came.

After that I ended up with the swollen boobs but I mean that happens around O time anyways. So I chalked it up to hormones. Then all of the sudden my partner starts acting weird. Says he ""feels in his soul"" that I'm pregnant which just doesn't make much sense at all....at all....

So AF day comes...and goes...no AF. By this time I had the mood swings apparently and I started ""Having weird cravings"" and ""smelling everything"". Really its that my partner smokes and lately their cigars just...stink now. So I hate when he smokes and it just makes me mad when they smoke around me because it STINKS. I can't even smoke them anymore. Doesnt mean I am Moody just means your cigars are STINKYYYYY. 

Anyways~
Waited until 5 days late and got a negative. Chalked it up to hormones BUT my partner is so adamant that I am pregnant that they actually dug up all the Progesterone that they could find from their HRT and basically made me promise to take them. [We recently lost a baby marking my 3rd miscarriage in a row. They all happen in early pregnancy making everyone believe that low progesterone is the issue, so wants me to take it to try to sustain the maybe baby] So basically did that and tested again yesterday 5 days later making me 10 days late; still negative. This is normal for me though. For some reason urine tests just dont work for me I either get negative or FAINT positive.

I am starting to think the progesterone is what is delaying the period but I am not sure. The major symptoms I have right now are frequent peeing and apparently mood swings that I seriously dont notice. There's also the nose still and the cravings and hunger and I am tired but honestly I think all of that might be the progesterone??? I looked up side effects. Only thing it said was the swollen boobs. Nothing else I have was listed. :( 

Main question is the progesterone is 100mg and I take morning and night. I cant see my doctor until the 25th. I only have 2 pills left so I am concerned that by some miracle if I AM pregnant the low progesterone spike would harm the baby and make me lose another, but I also feel like the progesterone is just causing these symptoms and delaying everything? 

I was debating going to ER or Urgent Care to try for a blood test but I work for HCA so I know insurance doesn't really cover that. I am stumped. :( What do???

I was due August 21st, 2018. On June 8th I lost my mucus plug and went to the hospital. I was found to be leaking amniotic fluid a bit, and after an ultrasound we found out my daughter had hydrops fetalis, which is fluid collecting in multiple areas. For our daughter it was her scalp, around her lungs, and in her abdomen. I also had polyhydramnios so I looked like I was full term. We were transferred to a hospital with a tier 3 NICU. I was stable and so was our daughter, but due to the leak we had to stay in the hospital. Hydrops babies have a 50% shot at surviving childbirth, and then if they survive that they have a 50% shot at making it to 28 days. As our time in the hospital went on the hydrops got worse and I was scheduled for a c section the next day. Except that night, June 18th, I went into labor, going from 3 to 4 cm in an hour, so I went right in for a c section. She was born at 11:17 pm. I won’t go into details, but she was intubated and had a lot of other tubes and monitors on her. Things weren’t great from the start, the next day they got a bit better, then that evening they got worse. Around 2am we got results back that showed she wasn’t responding to any treatments, and we were told she was on fentanyl for pain. My husband and I decided to end her suffering, and held her in our arms as she passed that morning, June 20th. 

Obviously this has been absolutely devastating. I’m recovering from a c section and my baby is gone, and it really, really sucks. People from the insurance company and my short term disability company, the hospital security guard, the pharmacist, and others have told us ‘congratulations ‘ and it’s just fucked up. 

Hydrops is just a symptom, not a disease itself, do we don’t know what caused it yet. We’re waiting for autopsy results, but a good portion of the time they don’t find out the cause. Everything was fine up through my 28 week appointment, and I’m under 30 and was otherwise healthy and low risk. 

Right now, I just want to find that new normal, and get back to a functional life.

Prior to getting pregnant, and even after my LC was born I would get my periods bang on 28 days. Even while BF around the clock, my period returned at 7 weeks pp and continued on its merry way, every 28 days. I’ve never been on birth control. 

I had my daughter at 23 weeks in March, I had 7 weeks of PP bleeding. Everything from back then is a bit fuzzy, but I think it was 2 weeks after that I had my first PP period that lasted 10 (horrific) days. I then had a 40 day cycle and had a back to normal(ish) period of 4 days, but the first day was exceptionally heavy. 

I am now at day 30 of my first official month TTC. I have tested about 6 times over the course of the last week and all negative. I tracked my ovulation by tracking CM, so I was pretty confident with my prediction but now I’m super confused. 

I know this is normal for after a loss, it just feels abnormal for me. And frustrating. I’m also travelling for a week without DH this month that, if I got my period at the right time, would’ve been ok. Now I’m thinking next month will be a write off which is bloody frustrating too. Grrrr periods. 

Also, I think I’m going to temp next month which is entirely new for me.

My sister also annouced she was pregnant for the first time and due only a week before me! My family was estatic, as were my sister and I. We even decided to have our baby shower together. 

Fast forward several months and we found out our baby has Trisomy 18 and will not survive so unfortunately we decided to terminate at 17 weeks. It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make and I think about her every single day. Her name was Madeline. She passed away April 13th. I know it has been a couple months but I still really struggle with it and definitely have some sort of depression because of it. I have been to a counselor a couple times but it really hasn't helped. I'm also 38 so really nervous to get pregnant again because I'm scared it could happen again. 

My sister's baby shower is this weekend. It was supposed to be my baby shower as well. Our family is huge and will all be there. I'm really dreading it because my family is very nosey and in your face and I don't want to start bawling in the middle of my sister's shower.

My fiance and I are currently still long-distance so we're not planning to TTC until around 2021, but we very much want children and I'm terrified the miscarriage I had in the spring might be indicative of something wrong with me or an otherwise recurrent issue.

I had a missed miscarriage at about 7 weeks back in April. The pregnancy itself was a huge surprise as it was an IUD failure pregnancy. When I first found out I was pregnant my HCG measured only 79, and I found out about the miscarriage when they did repeat bloodwork nearly two weeks later and my HCG had fallen by nearly half. When they did the ultrasound, it turns out the fetus wasn't forming right at all. There was a fetal pole, but no yolk sac and no heartbeat, and the gestational sac was an ""irregular cystic mass"". I saw the ultrasound photos and where it should have been round, it was all lumpy. The gestational sac was full of cysts. It wasn't a molar pregnancy of any sort - my HCG was low, not high - but I can't find anything online that gives any clue as to why the sac would be like that, nor can I really find other reports of the same thing happening to other people. My GP has said by her best guess it was probably a random genetic defect and not likely to happen again, at least not at any increased risk, but I'm really scared. My partner and I are going to start trying to conceive in about three years (I'm in the process of immigrating to the US to be with him so we want to get settled first) and I'm absolutely terrified that this is going to be a recurrent problem because I don't know how many times I can go through this. Is there anything that indicates any kind of fertility problem or the potential for recent miscarriages, or did I just get really unlucky?

I'm 26 years old, have a history of extremely mild endometriosis but nothing that would have kept me from getting pregnant (and it was removed 7 years ago). I have hypermobility spectrum disorder (which in my case, presents very similarly to hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos), mild dysautonomia (orthostatic intolerance), and a history of kidney reflux (corrected with surgery, but with some very mild residual kidney damage). I take lyrica, nabilone, wellbutrin abilify, trazodone, and tecta, but was told that none of these medications posed anything more than a slightly increased risk of birth defects, and that was only one or two of them. Nobody in my family has fertility problems or has had miscarriages that they know of. I'm 5'7 and 165 pounds, so a little overweight, but not obese. I don't smoke or drink at all.

I think I know when the actual miscarriage occurred, as I started to feel extremely sick the night before the repeat bloodwork was done.

Sorry this is long, I just dont’t get what’s even happening right now. So I know that cycles after a D&C can be weird, but I am just so confused. I had my D&C on 4/25, spotted for about 10 days and that was that. I didn’t have any kind of spotting until 6/8, where I’d had some pms symptoms and i had some brown light flow about 10am-12pm, then slowed down to spotting. Same thing the following day. No spotting 6/10, so I didn’t mark 6/8 as CD1. The same thing happened again on 6/11, but was slightly more(but still light and brown) so I marked CD1. This continued through my cycle with varying degrees of  light flow, but only in the morning or afternoon. It always went to spotting at night.

Well I had a positive OPK on CD11, which was the first time I was able to test because I’d still been bleeding, so I assumed I wouldn’t get a surge(I usually O CD25). I tested again with smu and at night and didn’t get anything close to positive, and haven’t since.

I had a temp spike on CD15, but FF doesn’t give crosshairs unless I disregard my high temp from CD11. My temps have stayed relatively high. I have been trying(and failing to properly use) my ferning microscope and haven’t gotten any kind of discernible pattern. Didn’t receive it until CD12.

The last three days I have been spotting red from about 9-11am. Nothing afterwards. No idea why.

Has anyone had random spotting like this before? I don’t get it at all. I’m kind of worried I’m not going to ovulate, my cm dried up after that temp spike and I’m not sure what to think. If I did O I’d be 7DPO. I’ve got progesterone symptoms too. BFN this morning. If I pin my current cycle on the start of my previous pregnant chart it follows the pattern, but it also follows the post ovulation pattern if I pin on O. I know I’m going to have to wait this out but damn if it isn’t frustrating.

It's been 18 cycles. I noticed spotting at the same time as I got the first positive test ever. Then the next morning the test strip was lighter and I knew what had likely happened. 

I went to work and held it together until I started cramping. I had to tell the charge nurse what was happening and she sent me home. I still feel embarrassed that I broke down in tears, though I would understand if one of my coworkers had done the same. I've been open with fertility issues at work, it's been helpful since a lot of my coworkers have had similar issues. 

We more or less confirmed it today at the doctors office. I remember the way my Dr's facial expression changed when I told her I'd been spotting and the test on the second day was significantly lighter. The urine test at her office was negative, and they're doing a blood test to confirm that I was pregnant at all. 

Waiting at the lab there were 3 pregnant women and children everywhere. I feel a little numb, but at least I'm not angry at them. 

My best girlfriend came into the city to take me to lunch and keep me distracted as long as possible. My husband still has his roleplaying group over, men sitting in my living room. I'm trying not to feel slighted that he wouldn't ask them if they could move their game so I could have privacy. He's trying, he holds me, and tells bad jokes to make me smile. 

Part of me wonders why I'm so sad when it was just a tiny little thing. The size of a poppy seed, small enough that you wouldn't even notice it leaving. After all if I hadn't taken that first test I never would have known. I would have thought it was an extra late period, extra sore breasts, no big deal. I had less than 24 hours to get used to the idea, and truthfully I didn't believe it would be viable anyway. 

I know it wasn't my fault, it wasn't anything I did, and anyway it's good to have confirmation that it's even possible after more than a year of trying. It would have been horrible timing, right before exams. Next month or the month after would way more convenient.

I remember the way my Dr&#39;s facial expression changed when I told her I&#39;d been spotting and the test on the second day was significantly lighter. The urine test at her office was negative, and they&#39;re doing a blood test to confirm that I was pregnant at all. </p>

<p>Waiting at the lab there were 3 pregnant women and children everywhere. I feel a little numb, but at least I&#39;m not angry at them. </p>

<p>My best girlfriend came into the city to take me to lunch and keep me distracted as long as possible. My husband still has his roleplaying group over, men sitting in my living room. I&#39;m trying not to feel slighted that he wouldn&#39;t ask them if they could move their game so I could have privacy. He&#39;s trying, he holds me, and tells bad jokes to make me smile. </p>

<p>Part of me wonders why I&#39;m so sad when it was just a tiny little thing. The size of a poppy seed, small enough that you wouldn&#39;t even notice it leaving. After all if I hadn&#39;t taken that first test I never would have known. I would have thought it was an extra late period, extra sore breasts, no big deal. I had less than 24 hours to get used to the idea, and truthfully I didn&#39;t believe it would be viable anyway. </p>

<p>I know it wasn&#39;t my fault, it wasn&#39;t anything I did, and anyway it&#39;s good to have confirmation that it&#39;s even possible after more than a year of trying. It would have been horrible timing, right before exams. Next month or the month after would way more convenient. </p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t make it hurt any less.</p>

I had my first miscarriage in June of 2015. It was a blighted ovum, resolved with cytotec. I was pregnant again soon after, and delivered a healthy baby girl.

After a year and a half, we decided to expand our family. Which lead to a new pregnancy in July of 2017. We saw the heartbeat  in september and fell in love. Then saw no heartbeat on the nuchal translucency scan one week later. This missed miscarriage was resolved with two doses of cytotec.

I knew for sure I wanted to try again in December. And was pregnant again February of 2018. This was also a missed miscarriage with at least 2 gestational sacs (at one point the obgyn thought she saw three), but no embryos. My obgyn had me wait a month ""just in case"" there was growth in either sac. There wasn't. I began cytotec on 5/23 and after two rounds completed the miscarriage. Every round of cytotec I've had is more painful and involves more bleeding than the last. I'm still waiting for my next period.

At this point, I feel absolutely hopeless about having another pregnancy.  I know the statistics about 25&#37;-33&#37; of pregnancies ending in miscarriage and just having bad luck. I might have even bought into it after two miscarriages. But at this point it seems clear to me that the statistics are different for me. Whatever ball game I'm playing, the rules are not the same. I just saw my obgyn for my last follow-up, but she did not suggest or recommend any further testing. She told me to wait until I'm sure I'm emotionally ready but then know that I have a 1/3 chance of miscarriage going forward because of my age (**I just turned 38**). She's laying the blame there.

What is next for me? Do I give up now and enjoy my family, my career, and my life? Life is good and I want to be present to enjoy it. I've spent so much of the last four years pregnant, miscarrying, or postpartum... everything else has been a bit of a blur. I know, given my age, that stepping off the roller coaster is something of a final decision. I logically know that I haven't done anything wrong and that I didn't cause this, but I still feel heartbroken and as if I somehow failed. There's been a lot of pain and suffering, both physically and emotionally. I don't feel like doing anything. I've gained a lot of weight. I am not able to give myself 100&#37; to either my family or my work. Everything is hollow and empty (I'm in treatment for depression).

On the other hand, I still have that deep desire to have another baby. I ache when I see pregnant women or newborn babies. I am so sad to think that my daughter will never have a sibling. If I had a reason for why the miscarriages were happening, I could cleanly either let go of that desire or pursue it. I need create some sort of narrative out of all this.

Tested this morning with a cheapy from the dollar store (how I got my positives from my 2 prior pregnancies before anything else picked it up) FMU and the whole thing, super clear, super obvious negative. I am crushed. July makes a full year officially of trying for a baby after our loss as that was when we got the all clear after losing ""Squish"" back May 2017. This marks the end of ""Month 2"" on Femara. Again, with nothing to show for it.

I have an appointment with my OB/GYN Wednesday morning to discuss what we are going to do moving forwards. I had my day 21 bloodwork done a couple weeks ago so we can look over that and see if that gives us any indication of what's happening and I'm going to bring up some things I've noticed in the last few months.

I just don't get it. How can I go from one of those lucky bitches who get pregnant at the drop of the hat (seriously it was stupid the 2 times I got pregnant how ""easy"" it was) and now this. A full year of trying and no luck. Not even a squinty line. I think that's what makes this all the more difficult to swallow and deal with. I'm tired of it, I just want to be pregnant, I want another baby, but I don't want to keep trying only to be disappointed each month when I need to go buy more tampons and all this bullshit again and again. I want a glorious ~12 months of no period (okay with the like 6-8 weeks of awful period from hell that is recovering from having a baby). 

Part of me wants to push for the OB to go ahead with the original plan of taking me in for surgery, do the D&C, do the flush/scope of both tubes to check for blockages, and potentially remove the largest of the cysts that got investigated a few months ago. But I also don't want to be holed up all summer and having to recover from surgery like that. (Also the ability to take time off during the summer right now at work is a GD nightmare, so I don't really know if I'll even be able to take the time off in the next 6 weeks. Which means ANOTHER 2 or so months of waiting before we get another round of treatment plan and then the obvious recovery time for the surgery itself). Which will bring us to nearly 2 years since our loss itself.

I'm angry, and upset, and just ugh. I tried posting something on the fertility subreddit and it did not go well and I'm feeling particularly unwelcome there (for anyone here who has cross over between the subs, please don't take that the wrong way). So I feel like I can't even get any suggestions/help there as I'm just not comfortable posting in that community.

Then the number more than doubled consistently so we were told we were possibly ok after all. Then, two days before the first ultrasound I started having sharp pains (though no blood). My fertility clinic told me to go straight to the ER. At this point I’m feeling like it’s probably ectopic and after the longest ultrasound I’ve ever had, the ER doc confirmed that it was and had already ruptured so we’d have to go into surgery. 

My husband and I try to process this for a couple of hours until the surgeon shows up (so the rupture must not have been too bad). Surgeon then tells us that because of the location (on my ovary), it’s likely a cyst and not the embryo. Hope lit us up and when I came out of the surgery my husband and I were in tears as the doc said it looked like a cyst so embryo might be just fine, we’d repeat beta in a couple days. 

Then this morning when we were heading out the door for the lab, the surgeon called to say that the report on the tissue had come back and it was the embryo after all. I just had an incredibly rare ovarian eptopic. Still did the blood work to make sure hcg was going down but I won’t have the results until Monday.

Since my miscarriage in February I’m having cramps starting  around 3-5DPO until my period (no cramping while I’m on it though) that I did not have before I got pregnant. We also suspected a chemical pregnancy first cycle we tried after the loss and my doctor thinks that the cramping might be that the egg gets fertilized and it’s fighting to stay but it fails :( And I guess low progesterone levels will explain it, right? I will appreciate any feedback or experiences about the topic.</p>
