I had a mmc in July and a blighted ovum about 2.5 weeks ago. At my follow up, the doctor said all is well but that they won‚Äôt have the results of the chromosomal testing for a few weeks. She also said that depending on the results, they would do some additional testing on me and my husband, which would hopefully give us some answers or no answers at all... both of which would be better than knowing absolutely nothing right now. However, I have to wait about a month for that testing since it can only be done when all the pregnancy hormones are gone. If I get pregnant and there‚Äôs something wrong again, I‚Äôd ultimately need to do the testing ‚Äî so I would just be prolonging the inevitable I suppose. During my first pregnancy, I was exhausted and super super sick during my first trimester. My husband and I just booked a ten day vacation at the end of December ‚Äî hoping to go hiking and disconnect from the world for a while. I also want to note that this place has good white wine which I love! So, now I feel torn.

I had a mmc in July and a blighted ovum about 2.5 weeks ago. At my follow up, the doctor said all is well but that they won‚Äôt have the results of the chromosomal testing for a few weeks. She also said that depending on the results, they would do some additional testing on me and my husband, which would hopefully give us some answers or no answers at all... both of which would be better than knowing absolutely nothing right now. However, I have to wait about a month for that testing since it can only be done when all the pregnancy hormones are gone. If I get pregnant and there‚Äôs something wrong again, I‚Äôd ultimately need to do the testing ‚Äî so I would just be prolonging the inevitable I suppose. During my first pregnancy, I was exhausted and super super sick during my first trimester. My husband and I just booked a ten day vacation at the end of December ‚Äî hoping to go hiking and disconnect from the world for a while. I also want to note that this place has good white wine which I love! So, now I feel torn.

22,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"This turned into a really long daily post so I decided to move it to stand alone. I spent a lot of time here in 2017 after my first mmc at 13+ weeks. I honestly never wanted to be back here as wonderful as everyone is. (TW: LC) >!I often checked in here on everyone during my subsequent pregnancy and live birth, and by daughter was born perfectly healthy in June 2018.!< We started trying again in July and got pregnant right away. 

The pregnancy felt doomed from the beginning. I had pretty slow rising hcg and my tests got darker, but I never had a dye stealer before I decided to stop testing. I had spotting at six weeks and ultrasound showed a sack measuring eight days behind. I was just worried until my scan at nine weeks which showed a healthy baby only four days behind, so within normal range, especially since I thought I ovulated late.

I decided to get NIPT drawn, and a couple weeks later when I called for results, I was told there was a 2/3 that my baby had Trisomy 18. Our world felt shattered. I was referred to an MFM who did an ultrasound at 13 weeks which showed a perfectly developing baby, no defects or anomalies. We decided to do a CVS which was done at 13+4. FISH results showed that only 1-2% of the cells were trisomic in the placenta, and my doctors were cautiously optimistic that the baby wasn't affected, but an amnio would be needed to confirm. My husband and I were leaning towards no amnio but were going to wait for another clear ultrasound and full CVS results before deciding. We had decided to transfer my care to the MFM because confined placental mosaicism has higher risk issues later on typically.

On Friday night, I started bleeding at 15+5. I went to ER and we found out our baby had no heartbeat and was measuring 11 weeks (which makes no sense since he was alive an well at nearly 14) on their shitty portable ultrasound. whoever was on call at my MFM said I wasn't in their primary care (wrong) and to call my primary OB. whoever was on call there said to just send me home. I wasn't on the right mind to advocate for myself. I said I would rather manage this medically but she just said to call my OB on Monday. 

On Saturday morning, I woke up to contractions. I labored for an hour and a half before mid contraction the pain stopped and I felt everything shift and fall. I ran to the bathroom and passed our little boy. I didn't realize he was still attached when I went to wipe and had to pull him out. I'm horrified that I had to do that and that I couldn't bring myself to look at him. My husband and I cried together. We didn't feel like we had any other choice than to flush and I feel like a monster about it. I was just so thankful, but also horrified, that my in-laws happened to be visiting because they were able to take care of my toddler during all of this. I don't know how we would have managed without them.

I continued to have contractions for another 4.5 hours while I passed several large clots/pieces of tissue I assume was placenta. Bleeding started to finally taper off. Yesterday morning I woke up to bad cramping and passed more large clots. I called my OB as soon as they opened and was scheduled for an ultrasound. There was still quite a bit of tissue so I was scheduled for a d&c later in the day. Everything went well. 

I'm currently wide awake at 5am writing this out. I feel so numb. I can't believe we've spent another four months pregnant with nothing to show for it but broken hearts. It feels so hard to imagine a future. Both my OB and MFM are willing to do further testing due to having had two second trimester(ish) losses now. We will probably do that with the MFM since we feel he has a better grasp and understanding of what all might be a problem. We don't want to wait a long time to try again, but feel like we need to have either an answer, or a clear to try again. 

I keep looking at photos and videos of my daughter when she's not up, thinking she's a freaking miracle and somehow I managed to keep her alive. I don't know how. I just feel doomed and we want so badly to grow our family. We're just so heartbroken that we won't be bringing our little boy home in April.

We didn&#39;t feel like we had any other choice than to flush and I feel like a monster about it. I was just so thankful, but also horrified, that my in-laws happened to be visiting because they were able to take care of my toddler during all of this. I don&#39;t know how we would have managed without them.</p>

<p>I continued to have contractions for another 4.5 hours while I passed several large clots/pieces of tissue I assume was placenta. Bleeding started to finally taper off. Yesterday morning I woke up to bad cramping and passed more large clots. I called my OB as soon as they opened and was scheduled for an ultrasound. There was still quite a bit of tissue so I was scheduled for a d&amp;c later in the day. Everything went well. </p>

<p>I&#39;m currently wide awake at 5am writing this out. I feel so numb. I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve spent another four months pregnant with nothing to show for it but broken hearts. It feels so hard to imagine a future. Both my OB and MFM are willing to do further testing due to having had two second trimester(ish) losses now. We will probably do that with the MFM since we feel he has a better grasp and understanding of what all might be a problem. We don&#39;t want to wait a long time to try again, but feel like we need to have either an answer, or a clear to try again. </p>

<p>I keep looking at photos and videos of my daughter when she&#39;s not up, thinking she&#39;s a freaking miracle and somehow I managed to keep her alive. I don&#39;t know how. I just feel doomed and we want so badly to grow our family. We&#39;re just so heartbroken that we won&#39;t be bringing our little boy home in April. I know it&#39;s always a risk, but I just honestly didn&#39;t think I would be back in this position, and it&#39;s just soul crushing.</p>

Or, choosing to ""be the bigger person"" by not agreeing, but maybe saying nothing and letting it roll off your back, knowing that people just don't get what you're going through?

I understand this varies by how close you are with someone (close friend vs. work acquaintance, etc.).

The specific case study in my life: I have a good friend who lives far away from me. She has two kids and we talked a lot about her pregnancies (she temped and charted before TTC, got pregnant twice her first try with charting). I told her when we started to TTC. I told her when I had a miscarriage. Her response was ""At least you know you can get pregnant"" and ""You might not have even known you were pregnant so early"" (I was at 7 weeks and had had two ultrasounds, one with a heartbeat. And one without obviously). 

At the time I just kind of said ""Yeah"" and let it go, but it has really changed how I think about her as a friend. And now, she is constantly sending me pictures of her two kids and seems like she wants updates on how I'm doing-- but I don't feel comfortable telling her how hard TTC again is right now. I want to remain friends with her and she is generally a caring and self-aware person. Is it worthwhile to tell her that the things she said months ago hurt me, and she shouldn't say them to anyone else going through loss in the future?

They said he measured 11 weeks, but we had seen him alive and well, measuring on track at about 13.5 weeks. They've sent me home to manage it at home. I'm terrified. Currently having contractions. 

The stories I can find here are all earlier natural losses, and I'm hoping someone can provide insight as to what a later natural miscarriage was like for them. I don't want to do this at home. I don't know what I'm supposed to do when my baby passes. I don't think I can look but I don't think I can just flush either. I'm horrified by these thoughts and just general fears of what's to come. I'm so angry to be back in this position. My previous loss at 13 weeks was managed with d&c.

Edit: I woke up to contractions around 5am. By 6:30 they were incredibly painful but then it just stopped immediately. I felt things shift really suddenly and went to the bathroom where I passed our baby. My husband came in and we cried and honestly I just couldn't bear to look. When I went to wipe, he was hanging out of me and I looked away and ended up having to pull it out a bit. And then we flushed and I feel like a fucking monster. Laying in bed now while contractions taper off.

<p>The stories I can find here are all earlier natural losses, and I&#39;m hoping someone can provide insight as to what a later natural miscarriage was like for them. I don&#39;t want to do this at home. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to do when my baby passes. I don&#39;t think I can look but I don&#39;t think I can just flush either. I&#39;m horrified by these thoughts and just general fears of what&#39;s to come. I&#39;m so angry to be back in this position. My previous loss at 13 weeks was managed with d&amp;c.</p>

<p>Edit: I woke up to contractions around 5am. By 6:30 they were incredibly painful but then it just stopped immediately. I felt things shift really suddenly and went to the bathroom where I passed our baby. My husband came in and we cried and honestly I just couldn&#39;t bear to look. When I went to wipe, he was hanging out of me and I looked away and ended up having to pull it out a bit. And then we flushed and I feel like a fucking monster. Laying in bed now while contractions taper off.</p>

106,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss," i write this hoping that perhaps another person‚Äôs thoughts or insights can help quiet my frantic mind.

Almost three weeks ago I had a D&C for my third miscarriage. I had a blighted ovum several years ago, immediately followed by a chemical pregnancy. After a break, not too long later I conceived my DS2.5. We had a smooth pregnancy physically, but it was marred by perinatal anxiety. I was constantly convinced that I was going to lose him, presenting multiple times for reduced movements towards the end. We had a fairly traumatic delivery but on the whole we were fine. I struggled with what I believe was postnatal anxiety (not diagnosed at the time) for the first year or so of his life.

The last 18 months have been much happier, and I was finally feeling ready for another baby. We successfully conceived on our first try. At 6 weeks a scan showed a heartbeat that was a little too slow; a week later it had stopped altogether. I waited another week before requesting a D&C.

My GP referred me to the Pregnancy Investigation Unit at my public hospital, as I have now reached the magic 3 miscarriages that move the conversation from ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs just bad luck‚Äù to ‚Äúthere is something wrong \[with you\]‚Äù.

I have also started seeing a psychologist, and have had two sessions with her, but to be honest I don‚Äôt feel like anything has changed. She‚Äôs nice to talk to but I‚Äôm spiralling.

When organising my D&C, the hospital also gave me a referral to have blood taken in advance of my PIU appointment (which is not until Dec 30 - a long wait). On top of the usual thrombophilias and thyroid levels (for which I‚Äôve been tested before and all was normal), they added karyotyping to the list. They also told me that I could start trying again once my period was back.

The following is now running through my mind at a million miles an hour:

* Could this still be¬†‚Äòbad luck‚Äô? My pregnancy achievement rate is 50% (of 8 cycles attempted, 4 have resulted in a pregnancy). My pregnancy failure rate is 75%. Can these stats still be explained by luck?? Is it even worth trying again before my appointment as it seems so likely that I‚Äôll miscarry if I conceive?
* What are the realistic chances this is a chromosomal issue of mine? (Karyotyping is looking for a translocation, right?) Why are they karyotyping me but not my husband? Is a chromosomal issue in me more dire than it would be in him?
* While we‚Äôre testing, should I be thinking about testing for other carrier diseases like CF and Fragile X and SMA? Do any of those cause miscarriage?
* Should I just stop now while I have my son? Was he a fluke for an otherwise subfertile woman?
* Why am I totally obsessing over unrelated (to my experience thus far) issues like birth defects and stillbirth when I‚Äôm not even pregnant? Why is this happening? Why do I feel like if I do manage to carry a pregnancy for longer it is doomed to fail?
* Why isn‚Äôt my seeing a psychologist curbing this??

I know this sounds like the ramblings of a madwoman but I needed to let this out somewhere, and maybe someone has some magic words that can bring some perspective. I‚Äôm certainly not asking anyone to diagnose me.. it‚Äôs more, which of these thoughts seem normal and which are outright paranoia? Is there something that can help me gain perspective?

My husband and I decided last summer (August '18) that we'd start trying. Came off the pill, got pregnant right away! Miscarried at 4-5 weeks in September in a traumatic trip to the ER. Got pregnant right away again in our first cycle. Got as far as a heartbeat and (very cautiously) dreaming about our next summer with a new babe. MMC at \~10 weeks; D&E at 11.5 weeks in the most cluster-fuckish two weeks of my life. Waited almost two months for AF to show up after that one, and miscarried again on June 1.

Now that we're actually TRYING (re: paying more attention to fertile windows and what not), we've been TTC for two months and I think my naive little heart was hoping it'd be just as easy as the first three times... and my heart just keeps getting broken.
