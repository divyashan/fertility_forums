The D&C was virtually painless today, and I am feeling well and just having a scant amount of bleeding, which I am thankful for.  I do have to say that my emotions are all over the place though.

<p>When thinking about TTC again, I keep getting stuck on gender. I was completely fine with either gender for our first, though I had a pretty strong preference for a girl. We found out Daisy was a girl for 10 weeks. We picked her name, bought clothes, I imagined her future and I adjusted my identity to being a mumma to a daughter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so terrified that we will conceive a boy next time. I thought this loss would make me care even less about gender, but it has done the opposite. Is this just me being confused by grief for Daisy, or have others experienced this?</p>

Heck, maybe someone can relate and will say something magical that will make this all seem ok. I currently am 3 weeks into my 4th loss over the last year.

The thought of being back at the stage of counting cycle days and waiting to ovulate and counting dpo.  I feel like I just can't do it. I can't be back there. But yet the thought of not having another baby is even worse. 

I admire the women out there that can go with the flow and not obsess about ttc. I have come to terms with the fact that it is just not me. I can't not count days. I can't not test early. The whole thing is just so emotionally draining. I try to crochet and read and binge watch good tv to help distract myself, but after 15 months of trying, I am burnt out.

I'm pretty sure my doctor is going to tell me to wait for 2 periods before ttc again which feels like an eternity away. I don't want to wait that long. I also don't want to try against medical advice because then I will only blame myself if I lose another baby.

I've been temping for awhile, but I'm new to Fertility Friend tracking, I usually use Ovia. I posted this in r/TFABChartStalkers as well, but this is my more common lurking group.

Background: had a MMC last January at 5 weeks, and a miscarriage last June somewhere between 8 - 12 weeks due to a cystic hygroma. Underwent a hysteroscopy in the fall and have been actively TTC for about 3 cycles now.

In past cycles I've seen a steep drop just before ovulation, but not this cycle. I've also never had such a slow, steady rise (presumably) after ovulation (increase of 0.1 degree C for the last five days), with no sharp spike. I'm approximately 4 DPO right now, but that's just my guess since there was no drop or steep rise. Would love feedback on if you think I ovulated, and if the slow rise vs. a steep jump is common?

 Ok so I had posted a few days ago about pain and pressure I was having. I went in not really in pain and she said it was most likely the sack is about to pass and if it doesn't in a couple days or gets worse then to go back. Ok cool. Fast forward to me waking up at about 2:30am in a bit of pain because I had to pee. Right after I went pee my pain went from 1 to 1000! I got down on my knees started to vomit. Crawled to my husband, pulled myself up on the bed and woke him up to take me to the ER. He dropped me off because our 8 yo was asleep at home. I waited about 30 minutes in such severe pain in my whole uterus and lower abdomen. Triage guy saw how bad I was hurting and demanded I get put in the back even though there were no beds. They got me in a wheel chair, took my blood, gave me some Tylenol with codene, and sat me in the hall. The medicine took the edge of the pain. Had to call my boss like 40 times to wake her up and call out. At about 6am I got a bed in the hall. Pain started coming back. Had to jump out of bed and run to the bathroom to dry heave pretty hard, because my nurse was nowhere to be found to get one of those barf bag things. 
 Doctor comes around 7am and asks a few questions. Says it's most likely related to the miscarriage and that it's probably retained tissue. Schedules an ultrasound. Husband gets there after dropping son off at school. They take me for my ultrasound. The tech was asking what they said at my doctors office and at the ultrasound they did. I told her they said they couldn't see anything. She has me do a vaginal ultrasound. The whole time she kept asking me am I sure that's all they said. And sounded pretty judgy of the person who did my last ultrasound. I'm thinking ok she can see the sack. They take me back to the hall. A lab tech comes to take blood. She gets a couple vials and then heads to the nurses station. Not even 2 minutes later she's back asking if I did labs earlier. I said when I first got here yea. She says she's so sorry but they just ordered more and needed to draw again. Cue me rolling my eyes and just accepting this is my life.
 They start serving breakfast at about 9. I get skipped, the nurse sees me eyeing the food cart, I hadn't eaten since 8:30 the night before. She comes over and says I'm not allowed to eat or drink anything. I'm thinking oh they want to do a D&C. Doctor comes by finally and says we are waiting for the on call obgyn to look at your ultrasound because it was concerning. It looks like its ectopic! Little back story to make sense of what is coming next. I had an ectopic in 2007 where I had emergency surgery. They took the end off of my left tube and sealed it. So clearly when he said ectopic I was shocked and devastated. I was going to have no tubes left. I tried to keep it together as best I could. My husband kept telling me it was going to be ok. I called my step mom and we cried. 
 The OB took forever. I finally saw him at like 1:45pm. He asked questions, mostly about where the pain was. Examined me, pushing on my uterus and tubes trying to see where it hurt most. Except to me it all hurt the same. He said it was most likely ectopic and somehow were not sure which tube. He said if it's in my right he would do what he could to save it, but couldn't promise anything. My last surgery they cut me wide open. So he said he would try laparoscopic and if he couldn't get it he would open me up on my scar. 
 Nurse comes to put in my IV, ends up blowing my damn vein. She gets it in my hand. I finally get more pain meds. Go to pre-op at 3:30pm. My darling husband wiped me down and helped me change into my new gown. I can tell he's super worried. My surgery got delayed because the doctor got caught up in a delivery, because of course he did...
 Go in around 5:30-6. I wake up in some pain. Nurse hooks it up with the morphine. Then they let my husband come in and he told me it went good it was in your left tube. I'm like whaaaat?! How is that even possible???? I'm still not even sure how it got in there. They took the whole left tube out this time and was able to do it laparoscopically. 
 Get in my room and they want me to pee in a bed pan. I'm laying flat and manage to get a bit out. But I know me and I have more. I tell the nurse I can't go but I need to. I tell them to ask about getting a catheter. They tell me they'll ask but they usually don't want to because infection risk. It takes ages. My bladder is so full and I'm balling and screaming in pain. Nurse does a quick ultrasound of my bladder to be sure I actually need to pee that bad. My bladder is huge. They get the catheter, instant relief. Stayed the night, went home next afternoon. I'm pretty sore, but somewhat relieved it was an ectopic instead of a miscarriage. If that makes sense.

AND ALSO in February 2016 we conceived immediately after my D&C only to have a CP.

February can basically just bite me. 

I realized that since we're technically TTC again this month (more like NTNP) if I were to conceive I've have almost the same timeline as my first pregnancy. Eek.

I lost my first baby, my boy Riyad, at 38 weeks on November 3rd. I had a perfect pregnancy. Low blood pressure, did everything I had to and more (DHA supplements, exercise, you name it)...and his heart just suddenly stopped beating one day. Never in my wildest imagination would I have expected to have a full term stillbirth. We never expected our baby would die so late in the pregnancy. 
I was at my OB for my 38 week check up two days before I found out my baby died. The heartbeat was perfect, he was in position for labor, and I was starting to dilate. We talked about packing a hospital bag. He was moving a little less but everyone told me it was normal because he was running out of space and labor was coming! So I believed it was fine. Looking back I think he died a few hours after my doctors appointment. I went to the mall with my sister and walked around a bit, and started to feel strong cramps. So I stopped and rested. Then he started kicking like crazy and I made a snarky comment to my sister about how crazy active he's being. I thought nothing more of it. 
The next day I woke up and suddenly burst into tears. I was extremely emotional for no reason--first time I started crying like that in my entire pregnancy. My husband was concerned and asked if I needed to go to the hospital. I said no, the baby was fine. I chalked it up to nerves about being a new mom. We installed the car seat that day and put together the stroller....and the whole time I barely felt my baby move. I would later find out what I thought was him moving turned out to be phantom kicks and shifting due to the amniotic fluid. I had no idea. I was worried about him being less active but still I thought he was lazy because he's most active at night. Night came and he was still ""lazy."" This is where I feel most guilty. I kept telling my husband I'm fine. Although I appeared very nervous and moved my stomach around several times. I went to l&D a lot for little reasons that turned out to be nothing. I didn't want to look like a paranoid mom, we had just went to the doctor, and I was so sure he was fine.
We went to L&D the next morning just to be sure he was ok, and they couldn't find a heartbeat. I gave birth to him. They told my husband he was gone for at least 24 hours based on his appearance. I was too drugged up and in complete shock to really do anything that day. My OB thinks it was a Silent Placental Abruption that came out of nowhere and took his life. There was a clot on the placenta that must have made it detach and deprive him of oxygen. I have no risk factors. I've been tested for clotting disorders with everything coming back negative. 
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to go through in my life, and I don't have a solid answer as to why my son died. It tears me apart. The guilt eats at me. I should have gone as soon as I thought it was weird he wasn't moving as much--but everyone tells me there was nothing I could have done and most likely he was gone by the time I noticed. 
I want to get pregnant again. I met an MFM and she told me she sees no reason for me not to get pregnant again.

After I seemingly balanced out, I got pregnant and then had a miscarriage in November. During the pregnancy I craved tomatoes and meat. Sometimes I would have 5 steaks for dinner. I was still low in iron somehow.

I have been reading this sub since my first loss in May of 2015, but I guess I didn't feel seasoned enough to contribute or be worthy of sharing.

I hope I did the trigger portion correctly... I have two boys (9 and almost a year), as well as three losses. Two of the losses were confirmed by physicians. One was a chemical that I tracked on tests at home. 

My husband and I had an accidental pregnancy while I was on the low dose pill (son one). Then eight years of lazy pregnancy prevention that never resulted in a second child. We divorced, and about a year later I had a condom failure (I'm guessing) with my significant other. This resulted in a loss at 6 weeks 4 days. It was brutal, isolating, and only my SO and two friends knew. 

I was depressed and in a hole afterward. Prevention was not on my mind; I could barely make it to work and function for big kid. Pregnancy number two with SO came two months later and resulted in a son who is almost a year.

I had a chemical pregnancy in July, which I kept to myself and handled surprisingly well. Then I found myself with a positive test two days after Christmas. I was picking out an announcement shirt for the little one and planning how to surprise my SO. January 1st was a day of excitement for the new year and hope for my family. I was testing twice a day and comforted by darkening lines.

January 2nd was cramping, spotting, and tears. I knew from the first streak that it was over. My primary care provider was atrocious and told me they wouldn't draw labs and to go to the ER. I couldn't afford the ER, so I went to an OB who confirmed the loss and offered to prescribe me Clomid (?!).

I told myself no more. No testing. No unprotected sex. No thoughts of babies. Just no. So here I am on CD30 post MC, fourth day in a row of testing, feeling crazy every time I see a negative. I don't know where to go from here, but I think it's time to start opening myself to both giving and receiving support through this unpredictable process.

I'd like to know if my story of physical (emotional is a whole other thing- I'm still waiting for a day where I don't cry) recovery is similar to others.

I had a diagnosed Blighted Ovum at 8 weeks, two weeks ago. I'm 30 and we were trying for three cycles. Long and horrendous story short (I'm sure you all know these), I was showing no signs of miscarrying naturally, so I took 4 cytotec vaginally and passed a lot of blood and the sac within four hours and continued to bleed for the next two days. Two days later, and a very reassuring talk with the gynaecologist at the hospital, they found that I still had some blood and tissue inside. Five days of oral cytotec and rest were ordered (I bled and cramped painfully the whole five days, but nothing compares to the first vaginal dose). I went back in to my gynaecologist for a check-up once the medication was finished and my doctor found that it still wasn't all out. After conferring with the hospital, she told me that I have too little fluid and tissue left for a D&C (12mm, apparently 16mm or more is the threshold). She said I will stop bleeding and that my next period will be awful, but to call her after that.

I don't bleed as much anymore, but I still pass tissue at times and a little blood. I need to wear a pad, but never come close to filling even half of it.

I suddenly wanted to have sex for the first time since then (can't because of risk of infection and.... eww) and felt just overall just good.

In June of 2014 I got pregnant. We had been using the ""rhythm"" method, plus he always pulled out. (Sorry if that's crass.) Honestly, I thought it would always work, because it had for so many years. I was panicked, and horrified. For about 3 days.


Then I was in love, and planning the baby's entire future. I felt like I'd woken up a different person, whose life's purpose was to be mother to this baby. My husband and I were over the moon.


At 19 weeks and 1 day, I lost my son to an incompetent cervix. His name was Luke. He was perfect, and my body failed him.


Since then, I have gotten pregnant four times: one chemical pregnancy, and three missed miscarriages. 


So I am extremely bitter, and fucking angry, and have lost all belief in any kind of God. I feel like I have failed my husband, who so deserves a child. He is 6 years younger than me, so I feel like I stole his chance to be a father. 


I also feel like life has lost its purpose. I am not suicidal, just simply don't see what there is to look forward to. Most of us measure our lives in milestones, personal ones, then the ones of our children. But without children, what then? I am where I want to be in my career, and happy in my marriage, and have nowhere to ""go"" from here. Nothing to strive for.


Of course we will try until I hit menopause, but I don't have much hope left to muster. No, I don't want to adopt, I want my *own* baby, a piece of my husband and me. I want to watch my child's personality develop and try to decide where he or she got which trait. I *deserve* it. But I don't think it will happen, and for this I feel like I am wasting my husband's life. And my own, to be truthful.


I just want everyone to fuck right off most days. But I have to go to work. And no one wants to talk about all my dead babies. No one says his name. Luke. 


I'm just laying here on my couch, still bleeding and cramping from my last D&C on Tuesday, and crying, and hoping someone out there really, truly gets this. I mean really, truly understands how much I feel I've lost.

I found out on Thursday that we lost the baby. The next day I got some unexpected but huge recognition relating to my desired career path (I'm an artist with an unrelated part time job). So I was feeling conflicted emotionally. Obviously I was excited for the good things that were happening, but I am still fresh into my heartbreak of this miscarriage.

I was getting a lot of messages almost forcing me to feel happy just because something good happened in the midst of my pain. Things like ""this is all so right, focus on the good."" I know people generally mean well, but why on earth would you choose those words? I am only human. I can feel a lot of feelings at the same time, and one does not erase another. And right now, my depression outweighs it all.

It's hard to transition all of my hopes and dreams to a sibling.  Also, since Max was carried to term, the medical recommendation is to wait 18 months prior to trying again.  That time seems infinitely far away.  But he taught us both that we want a child more than we ever could have imagined.

We finally started doing testing for recurrent pregnancy loss and discovered I have a uterine septum which causes miscarriage because often the embryo implants to the septum (which is usually located in prime implantation territory of the uterus) and there is not sufficient blood supply to baby so it grows a bit and then dies.

I felt relieved to have an answer, and a solution as we scheduled surgery for February 14 to have the septum removed. The most ridiculous thing happened, I found out I was pregnant by total accident on January 1st. We were preventing, but I ovulated 5 days early than normal and well, no one to blame but myself, we were not being careful enough. With all the effort I had to put into conceiving each time, I never thought I would ever have an unplanned pregnancy. But I thought, wow, maybe this is our miracle baby. After all, I'd read plenty of success stories of women with my condition and my doctor assured it's possible to go full term.

I had 2 early ultrasounds. One showed that the embryo was off to the side and this made me feel so optimistic and confident, it appeared to be nowhere near my septum. The second ultrasound showed us measuring right on track with a strong heartbeat.

Today we had a 3rd ultrasound, I should've been 7w2d but was measuring 6w5d with no heartbeat. My other 2 MMC only grew to just shy of 7w as well after establishing a heartbeat. I can't believe it. Four losses in 11 months. I can't stop asking how much more of this I can take. And why did this happen? The solutions were all in place and then I have to suffer yet again? Why? Life feels so unfair.

I have to push my surgery back now because I need to be on hormones for 4 weeks prior, and I can't do anything until this is complete. I have a d&c scheduled for Monday and we are going to test the tissue for the second time (first loss we tested showed normal results). And then after my septum surgery I have to wait 3 cycles to TTC. Knowing I can't possibly have a baby before 2018 is an overwhelming thought, this year has just begun. It feels so far away and it makes me so depressed, all the waiting.

And I do worry about my fertility. I'm 34 and my follicle/egg count was on the low end of average when I was tested. I know I am getting ahead of myself and eventually I will chill out and accept it all.

I've been trying to conceive for 2 years now. After 1 year of trying to no avail, last year I had three failed pregnancies (1 at 7 weeks, 1 suspected ectopic, 1 chemical). Between losses 1 and 2, we were given the totally helpful diagnosis of ""unexplained fertility"" and my RE's best guess about the recurrent losses since then is ""hopefully just bad luck."" However, since the 3rd loss he did suggest I take baby aspirin and progesterone every month (just haven't gotten pregnant since to see whether that helps!).

Anyhow, after the 3rd loss, I wasn't willing to wait around. Because all of my miscarriages were technically chemicals in that they weren't found on ultrasounds, my RE didn't think a recurrent loss blood panel would reveal much. I disagreed, and we did our blood panel several weeks ago. 

Thanks to some lab errors, our karyotype test was lost, so we had to redo it. But of the results that my RE has received, none were abnormal except my lupus anticoagulant result was ""indeterminate."" I also re-did that test, but RE thinks that it's unlikely to be positive the second time around. (And given that the lab lost another test altogether, I wouldn't be surprised if the inconclusive result might be attributed to lab error as well.)

From what I've read, the positive lupus anticoagulant thing does seem to be associated with later losses, like after 10 weeks or so. And I understand that a positive result falls somewhere along a spectrum of seriousness. But I wonder:
- what's the deal with an inconclusive test? have you had one? 
- would being even ""a little bit positive"" for lupus anticoagulant possibly explain my ""bad luck"" so far?
- with all three pregnancies, I bled enough to assume I had gotten my period, only to find out I was pregnant a few days later. Any connection between heavy implantation bleeding and clotting issues?

I guess there's a little part of me that hopes this second test will be positive because it will at least give me an explanation and treatment for my problems. I know that's a dangerous line of thinking, but at this point I will take what I can get! Any advice or insight on these related issues would be so helpful.

Sorry if this question has been answered before or it's the wrong place to ask--I am still a relative newbie here. When I did a search, I found a lot of people saying they had EWCM and positive OPKs with no temp spike asking if they ovulated, but I am experiencing the reverse.

I am on cycle 4 of trying to conceive after an MC in October. I had not charted at all before that pregnancy, so I don't know what was normal for me before. I think I am ovulating regularly, because I have been consistently getting nearly positive OPKs on CD 12 and then higher temps starting on CD 14. But I have never had a fully positive OPK (even when taking them multiple times/day from CD 10-15) or any EWCM at all. In fact, I hardly have any CM of any kind throughout my cycle.

I didn't have a lot of expectations, I really just thought it would be about the D&C procedure itself and less about Toxoplasmosis, which is rare here. I expected the doctor to not really know when we could try again and he would send us to somewhere else, probably in a larger city. 

It was mind blowingly good. I walked out SMILING. I purposefully wore dark eye makeup so I wouldn't cry, it was very helpful. The doctor is from Italy and I've heard he's very highly regarded. He said I'm the first person he's dealt with who has toxo since he left Italy - over there it's quite common but women get screened for it, while they don't here (NZ) He was impressed with my husband figuring out what it was and us pushing to get get tested. And at the end he APOLOGISED for not picking it up. I was so shocked by that - how would he have known?! I went to him for hyperemesis, I don't expect the guy to be a mind reader. But he was genuinely remorseful. 

We had already cheated and asked for the pathology before the appointment and he's interpretation of it was the same as ours. He said it might not take the full year to be able to ttc so I will get monthly blood tests until my antibodies are down. He referred me to a dietician as well - I lost 20 kgs between weeks 12 and 17 in my pregnancy but then put some of it back on and i want my weight to be stable before we try again. 

Anyway it was a positive appointment, except for seeing a work colleague in the hall of the hospital and her 10 year old asking me what I was doing here. The mother didn't call her out either so I just kinda stood there not knowing what to say - I just said 'Just stopping by to say hello' IM BAD AT LYING. 


Also, i wrote a post in BabyBumps before I miscarried about a run in I had with a member of hospital staff. You can find it (poorly linked because I'm on my phone) here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/5i1epr/i_have_an_archnemisis_and_her_name_is_sharyn/

Well I complained to the local health board and got my letter back today. It's a great apology but they wrote a paragraph about my miscarriage - it happened some time after that complaint so I find it kind of weird they reference it so much. It means the person writing the complaint has seen my medical records, and is not just following up on a complaint about poor customer service. I'm not really mad about it, it's just weird. I'm probably over reacting. I hope the woman knows I miscarried due to toxoplasmosis, a disease she literally laughed off. 

I have this weird way of thinking about happiness is life - like there are three pillars - career, health and family. Career encompasses finances, job satisfaction, education etc. Health is pretty simple and family includes my marriage. I've never been able to be happy with all three at once, usually one has to suffer in order for the others to be going well, and it mostly tends to be my health, taking care of myself ect. This year I want to be happy with all of them, but it's my career that's going to be the tough one. I still cannot even fathom going back to work. I went back last week for a coffee and my colleague forgot to let people know I was coming so i pretty much just ran to my office, only saw a few people, no one really spoke except for hello. It seems so pointless, but job is so unchallenging and unsatisfying. I had already gone on maternity leave so in my mind I wasn't going back - having to back is like a huge admition of failure to myself and others. So I need to focus on how to make this easier because right now I kind of sweat thinking about it. Tips would be appreciate if you have any!

I am quite not sure if this is the right subreddit for this to ask this question.


Some history - I am in mid 30's, no kids. My Fibroids were discovered during 1st pregnancy, though initially was told would not cause any harm, had miscarriage at 23 weeks. 2 fibroids are towards outside, 1 intramural, and 1 about 6cm submucosal, which is the main cause of concern as its occupying the cavity. My OBGYN asked me to see a RE.


**Reproductive Endocrinologist**- suggested to do laparoscopic surgery to remove the fibroids. He also said we may have to have IVF later on if Fallopian tubes get damaged or scarring.  
We went for an second opinion, to a Gyn surgeon.


**Gynecologic surgeon** - Thinks its safer in my case to go with abdominal myomectomy, even though he is well known robotic/laparoscopic surgeon, as the one inside cavity needs to be carefully removed and endometrial lining preserved. He thinks surgeon will have full/better control during the procedure to do a clean job and suture it well, so that it doesn't rupture during future pregnancy. He did not suggest IVF or anything yet and is optimistic everything will be fine afterwards, even though recovery time is slightly longer.


Has anyone been in similar situation? How did you decide what type of surgery to have? Please share your experience . Thanks!

I really didn't expect them to constantly check in, but the lack of contact really shocked and hurt me. 

I no longer live in the same city but I was there visiting my family 4 weeks after my D&C and ended up getting together with my two friends. They didn't even ask how I was doing! No mention of anything at all. It was like nothing had ever happened. I felt myself growing more and more angry and frustrated. Reflecting on why, I guess I feel that they were dismissing my feelings and minimizing what I had been through.

MC in July, been TTC as soon as possible which was September. I think I was appropriately sad and angry and grieved. I had a friend who I talked to about everything and then she got pregnant within 12 days of trying--- so that stopped. 

I've skipped baby showers and really cut back on small talk with people just to avoid the conversation. 'No kids?' -- not for lack of trying, thanks for asking. I recently mentioned to my dad that I'd rather not talk to ppl at weddings because small talk is hard. He calls me today and rather bluntly tells me it's time to move on. Also today my friend who is pregnant texts me (keep in mind we haven't talked in over a month now) to tell me that she is going to announce her pregnancy. 

Am I a horrible person to be shutting myself off like this? It helps me not break down in public and, unfortunately, my feelings are on my face and I can't hide my annoyance during a conversation. I feel bad my friend seems to be tip toeing around me about her preg--- but I can't fake happiness all the time. And as far as my dad telling me to 'move on,'--- I can't wake up one day and be ok as much as I'd like to. When I see a pregnancy announcement I still get physically sad and a bit angry.

I had a chemical pregnancy last month and my husband and I decided to start trying again right away. I ovulated around the same time I normally do this month (confirmed with temping and opks) and around 9 dpo I started having the brown spotting I normally get before my period arrives but then nothing else after that. I am now 17 dpo (with a normal 11 day luteal phase) and my period finally made an appearance this morning.

According to all my obsessive googling it's normal to ovulate later than usual and thus have a longer cycle following a miscarriage, even an early one. I've also read it's common to have a shorter luteal phase that next cycle. But I can't find anything about having a longer luteal phase? 

My fear is that it was another chemical pregnancy, and this may become a recurrent problem. I promised myself not to test this month until 18 dpo so I'll never know for sure. Should I assume it was, and talk to my doctor about it? Or is it more likely my cycle was just out of whack this month because of the mc, even though it was so early on (4.5 weeks)? I'm really hoping it's the latter.
