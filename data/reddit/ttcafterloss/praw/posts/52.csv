3,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Backstory: We've had seven losses in the past two years. Three chemical pregnancies, two at 8 weeks, one at 9 weeks, and one at 16 weeks. We're mainly interested in the 16 week loss, as it was confirmed chromosomally normal, and we have a balanced rearrangement that likely explains many of the early losses.

My wife's obstetrician and one of our maternal-fetal specialists has suggested my wife try a prophylactic dose of heparin in the next pregnancy, as the second trimester loss was sudden (baby's heart just stopped, no other warning signs), and could be due to clotting. We are happy to follow this advice.

Before anyone asks, we have monitored thyroid, progesterone, etc. My wife has also tried metformin for two pregnancies. No she is not diabetic, and does not have PCOS -- we were just running out of reasons for first trimester miscarriage. This was before we found out about our chromosomes, which may explain some of our early losses. 

A friend suggested we talk with a 'reproductive immunologist'. This is a new field, but we wanted to cover our bases. Of course, insurance wouldn't pay, so it was all out of pocket ($700 just for the appointment, not including testing). During the appointment, we were told that it would be dangerous to try the heparin, since my wife has no indication of increased clotting on blood tests. This was one data point, and we still wanted to do something, so we decided to stick with the plan of doing low dose heparin that the other doctors had suggested. Other than that, he did not prescribe anything beyond what my wife had already tried and what we will continue to try -- thyroid medication and progesterone. He concluded that he could not explain our second trimester loss. He could not find any immune causes for any of it, and said our case was 'puzzling'. That's fine -- we understand that a doctor cannot magically solve this for us, but we valued the doctor's opinion.

Today, we get a letter from the doctor's office regarding our 'treatment plan', where the doctor has prescribed *double* the dose of heparin the MFMs and Obstetrician have already prescribed.

As you can imagine, we were very confused why his advice went from 'it's dangerous' to 'take double the dose'. I called the office today and was treated very rudely by one of the receptionists, who eventually revealed that the letter was not written by the doctor, but actually by the 'patient care director' (who does not have a medical license). I asked to speak with the doctor or to leave him a message, but she wouldn't let me, and insisted we speak with the patient care director tomorrow. We are doing that, but still really want to speak with the doctor.

Just feeling completely scammed and like we paid a bunch of money to speak with a quack and ultimately be treated by an unlicensed clerk (I'm not even sure she's a nurse). I paid a lot of money for this appointment, and while I didn't expect magic, I do expect to not be treated like an idiot. I paid for the doctor's opinion, not the front desk staff. None of these treatments are without risk, and had the doctor himself recommended the blood thinners during our appointment, we would have had many more questions to ask him.

Not really sure what I want... Mainly wanted to complain in a safe space. Also, does anyone actually know if it's legal for a medical clerk to simply dose drugs? That seems dangerous.

4,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hey everyone,
I had my post-op with the surgeon earlier today. She was the first one to show me any compassion or competence in my hellish night, so I was glad to be seeing her and not one of those other sorry excuses for human beings. 

She told me that I was on the verge of going into shock when she got me and she was so, so glad to see that I was up and walking okay with color in my cheeks. I had blood work done last friday, and my HCG has gone way, way down. My blood supply is recovering at a good rate due to being on pre-natal vitamins for the last year or so. (I started even before I was trying to get pregnant). She also said as soon as she got the call she had them prep the operating room and everything so they could start as soon as I got there. Wow, it's almost like she cared about saving my life. What a refreshing change of pace. She said I wasn't the first pregnancy-related disaster they'd got from that first hospital. Unbelievable.  

She said she had also looked at the other tube and it's completely healthy. There wasn't even anything wrong with the one they removed and the pregnancy was at the very end. I don't know how to feel about that. On one hand, it's incredibly bad luck and that sucks that I almost died due to bad luck. It sucks that the zygote was just barely out of place. There's nothing I could have done to change the outcome. On the other hand, she said my risk for another ectopic doesn't actually rise that much. I'm sure in the future I'll be happy about it, but right now I just feel like ""Why me?."" She also said that the healthy tube can reach across to scoop up the egg from the lonely ovary and I've probably only lost 20% of my fertility. Since it was under a year of trying for this pregnancy, she was optimistic that we can go on to have a healthy pregnancy. 

She recommended that we wait 3 months before we start trying again. In the grand scheme of things, that's not that bad, but it really sucks right now. My husband is in his mid-30's and has been patiently waiting for me to feel ready and for us to have our ducks in a row. He's been ready for years. We've literally engineered our entire life together around having kids - saving money, buying a home in a good school district, me coming to grips with the childhood abuse I suffered and getting to a healthy place emotionally - and now there's this delay to a process that's already going to be slowed down. I think the best thing we can do is make an effort to be kind to ourselves and support each other while we process this traumatic event. 

We asked more questions about fertility and the future. She promised to prioritize monitoring the early pregnancy the next time if we chose to go with her as our caregiver, which I think we will. She'll start monitoring the HCG as soon as we get a positive and get us a sonogram as soon as something can be picked up. Then, after it's confirmed that everything is going smoothly, she'll recommend a midwife to us. 

I'm not a big hugger, but both my husband and I hugged her when we left. I guess it's different when someone saved your life after such an ordeal.

Of course, it was negative.

I cried to my wife that I feel hopeless. This January makes a year since we started trying for Baby #2 (with our loss taking up April-September), and this is cycle #4 since the loss. I feel like this is never going to happen for us. Like I did something to not deserve a second living baby.

Crying, I went out to the kitchen to make my five year old some breakfast, and he asked what was wrong. We've been very open with him about the loss, and I grew up in a really repressive house and actively try to avoid that with my son, so I went ahead and said, ""I just really miss Eliza."" He deeply sighed and said, ""Mama, we've TALKED about this,"" like he was just so exasperated that I couldn't get over it. Then he left me and went into the bedroom and repeated the conversation to my wife. I didn't speak my initial snarky reaction, because he's only five, but there was a whole lot of, ""Sorry that my grief is INCONVENIENT TO YOU"" going on in my heart. I know there's no way on the planet he could possibly understand how I'm feeling, and to him it is incomprehensible why I'd still be crying about something that happened five and a half months ago. But it hurt, anyway.

We had freezing rain yesterday and my wife's school was canceled this morning, but my son's wasn't nor was my work, so we had to switch cars so I could take our son to school and I could go to work. Unfortunately, the elementary school's drop-off line backs up right in front of our house. So not only could I not just drop my son off on the way to work, we couldn't even back out to switch the cars around. So we all walked to school on the slippery ground, while my son whined because he wanted to ride in the car like I'd told him we would. (He has some OCD problems and has a lot of difficulty with last-minute switches in plans). So with this huge delay, I got to work ten minutes late. Not that it matters, because NO ONE ELSE IS HERE. 

And one of my best friends is at her first pregnancy appointment today and I'm in this weird jealous/anxious place. I really really hope everything is perfect and amazing and I'm so happy for her. But I'm extra sad for me. But it's not about me. But as you all know, it's hard to separate that.

All this just to say I have come *so* so far in my emotional healing.

Yesterday my good friend who is due 4 weeks before I should be due, texted me about her baby shower in February. She has been super sensitive about my loss and doing and saying all the right things which I appreciate. When my husband asked if I would go, I said I didn't know if I could handle it because I was really upset about something her husband posted in their pregnancy announcement. He had written on Facebook, ""Our baby is doing great and it's all thanks to my wife"" and when I first read it, I was SO upset, I nearly commented, ""Moms can do everything perfectly and still have their babies die"" (I didn't, I kept scrolling). I realize that to most people, this is a major overreaction, and I obviously know he didn't have any ill-intention by his words. But it hurt and I can't and shouldn't have to validate why.

When I retold the story (I had kept it inside before this because I knew I was being ultra sensitive in my reaction), I started sobbing. All of these intense emotions came out unexpectedly. My husband looked at me with a blank stare. This is one of our challenges, me wanting him to agree with every emotion I have and feel my pain. From experience, I know that is not how it works. His response is to try to soothe me by saying, ""I am sure they didn't mean it like that..."" I ask him why he can't just say ""I'm sorry that you are hurting over this."" And then we bicker. It sucks.

Anyway, I saw [this image](https://i.imgur.com/4nJZQpV.jpg) on Instagram this morning and it put my feelings into words better than I ever could.

I'm 29, and my husband (40) and I have been ttc for 3 years now. For the first year or so I don't think I was ovulating (I was tracking at the time, but had super long cycles and periods that lasted weeks at a time). I was diagnosed with pcos and slightly elevated prolactin, for put on metformin and bromocriptine, and started ovulating by myself. A year later, still nothing. I got put on clomid, and had to stop after 5 cycles because it was making me really depressed, and didn't seem to be helping me get pregnant.

In November I was switched to femara, and to my amazement it worked. Except when I was around 6 weeks (a week after I first got a positive test) I started bleeding, saw my doctor who referred me to the hospital, and through an ultrasound and blood tests they confirmed the pregnancy had ended. My husband and I were devastated, but I thought ""well this happens sometimes I guess, it's unfortunate but we'll try again"". 

About 4 weeks after the bleeding stopped from that loss, I got another positive test. I was surprised, because my period hadn't even returned so I hadn't started femara again yet. I was terrified I was going to lose it again, tested multiple times a day to see if the tests were getting darker, which they were. A week passed, and I started hoping that maybe this was going to work out ok, started feeling good about knowing longer this time before anything happened. And then the following day (yesterday) I started cramping and bleeding. Pretty much the exact same as last time.

So here I am. Terrified I won't get pregnant again, terrified that even if I do it'll never be successful. When I told my husband I'd lost this one too, we both admitted to a strange sense of relief along with our sadness - we'd both been waiting for something to go wrong and it had.

17,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Buckle up. This is a long post. Probably disturbing for some folks.

My husband and I have been married for over 5 years. I was 23 when we married and had a lot of growing up/ establishing myself to do before we had kids, as did he. We are also planners - we have to be as his family lives across the country and mine are abusive to the point where I have been estranged for years. So, fast forward. After years of working hard, graduating college, establishing myself in a career and buying a cute house in a great school district, we began trying. I'm convinced the 6-month stress selling our condo (we had an awful agent, but that's another story) delayed conception because we conceived the cycle after the sale. We were very excited and broke the news to his family on Christmas. We were around 8 weeks at this point and past the higher ""rate of miscarriage"" ranges. 

The day after, I began to bleed. There had been some bad cramping the first few weeks, which returned along with this new, scary symptom. I was pretty disturbed by this as I had told my husband a few weeks ago that I was so glad I hadn't bled because trying a assess the volume, color, etc would be maddening. And, hey! I was right. It was. 

I emailed my Doctor, a naturopath, concerned. She said to wait three days. In hindsight, this was horrible advice as there was a 50% chance something was wrong. The blood got redder but not ""enough to soak a pad"" so I anxiously waited. It didn't go away. 

On the third morning I had resolved to get a sonogram, which my doctor had recommended anyway to date the pregnancy. When I tried to contact her, she was out of town on a family emergency. Her backup GP was sick. There is apparently no back up plan in this situation. She was emailing with us but refused to send a referral remotely because she thought I should we a doctor first. We had just been interviewing midwives the previous day but had no one established. My husband took over calling around because I was so distressed. The answer we got from hospitals over and over was ""Sure, we can do that... you are establishing primary prenatal care with us, right? No? Then you'll need a referral"". My husband finally convinced the other branch of our regular doctor's office to see us. He had to bargain them down to not making me sit through the 2 hour ""new patient"" session. 

This doctor gave me and examination and I explained I was eager to have a sonogram. She told me no. It was too expensive (Aren't I paying???) and too invasive (Isn't it my vagina the wand is going into???) and instead she was going to order a HCG test to see that the level was going up. Exhausted, I finally relented and we resigned to her 5-day blood work plan.

Just a few hours later I started having excruciating pains. I have a very high pain tolerance, so this was pretty weird. My husband came into the bathroom to find me curled around the detachable shower head, trying to ease the pain in my abdomen with hot water. He asked if I wanted to go to the ER and I agreed. 

Every bump and turn in the road was agony. He had just entered ""Emergency Room"" into google maps and the closest one was in the next town over, which is poorer and more blue collar than our city (details added for reasons that will become clear to you.)

We entered the ER, me doubled over in pain, sweating profusely and struggling to speak. Things started out poorly. The triage nurse seemed annoyed at the belabored manner that I was answering questions. My husband asked if I could lay down and she turned to him with an unwarranted annoyance on her face. ""I am trying to take the intake data right now. If she wants to lay down, she can lay across two chairs in the lobby."" As I sweated, swayed and moaned through the rest of The Rastafarian Data Entry Hour, apparently she saw it fit to lead me to a bed. Here's where we met Steve. Steven was an ER nurse with all the urgency of a sea cucumber. My husband explained that I was pregnant, had been bleeding and cramping, and was in excruciating pain again and helped me into a hospital gown. 

My situation worsened. I tried to get up to use the bathroom and fainted in a few steps. Even though Steve was in the room, my husband, Mike, who had caught me, had to call for him to come help get me back into bed. From that moment, every time I even sat up I fainted. Mike had to reiterate this several times at which point Steve declared that I was dehydrated. Steve apparently thought we had just come from a trek in the desert and that I had not had water in days to be dehydrated enough that my blood pressure was plummeting. He put an IV in my arm and hung a hydration bag. He asked if I was nauseous and I said I was only nauseous because I was in so much pain. He gave me an anti-nausea drug but no pain relief. At one point before that, Mike asked for pain meds for me and was told ""not until there's a diagnosis, and we're busy so that might not be for an hour or so."" So he asked for a heat pack. Steve's said he'd check and sauntered off like he was looking for a good place to take a selfie.  Mike hunted him down again to ask about the heat pack and he shrugged and said they were out. Frustrated and upset for me, he suggested a bag filled with hot water. Steve produced a latex glove filled with luke-warm tap water. 

Eventually, the doctor slouched in. If I thought Steve seemed non-challant, this man looked like he was taking it to an art form - hands in pockets, never approaching the bed, mumbling dispassionately. Mike and I explained the whole situation again, plus my new worsening symptoms. The Doctor's few question had already been answered several times to different people. He told us we'd have to wait on a sonogram but it might be about an hour. (Had he been the hold up? He didn't gain any new info by visiting us. Do they not have charts around this place??)

Steve was now cycled out with someone who I'll call derpy nurse. I am a feminist and don't prescribe how other women should live their lives, but she was like a stereotypical ""dumb blonde"" to the point that I wondered if she was high. She giggled at nothing constantly and hardly responded to me. She chatted in my room with other nurses about personal issues in a incessantly high-pitched moronic tone, giggling vapidly and talking about how the other nurses were her BFFs. At one point I heard her complain to BFF nurse that she just got on her shift and ""Steve had left me with a patient in this condition."" Three words for you, Derpy Nurse: Read. The. Room. 

I was very pale and this point and lying on my back was agony. The pressure and bloating in my lower abdomen was unbearable. This turned out to be blood slowly filling my abdomen. The sonogram technician finally arrived over an hour later. To her credit, she was polite and sympathetic and promised to follow up with the radiologist when she saw that even the smallest touch caused me to howl with pain. 

More time passes. Mike is holding my hand and stroking my head in between chasing down nurses and informing them that my vitals were causing the machine to emit and alarm. 

Dr. Sad Clown finally graced us with his presence. Again, without taking his hands out of his pockets or approaching the bed he uttered the Bedside-manner-award-winning line ""You've got a lot of blood around your uterus. Your pregnancy is ectopic and burst your tube. We're going to have to give you a blood transfusion so you don't bleed to death."" and then he left. Thanks for telling me that I A) Lost my baby and B) am in a life-threatening situation with the same tone and reverence that a quiznos employee would tell a customer that they're out of spicy mayo. 

More time passed with Derpy Nurse coming in with her same insensitive drivel, trying several times and failing to fit me with another IV, saying that I needed a second sample from a second site to match my blood type. A new nurse came to do what Derpy Nurse couldn't and I asked her for pain relief. She said I could probably have a quarter dose and she would work on that for me. 

The final stretch of bleeding into my chest cavity was after they said they couldn't operate at this hospital and would have to find somewhere to transfer me. I was in and out consciousness at this point, but Mike estimates it was about an hour and a half. I still had no pain medication. 

The EMTs were visibly shocked to see me when they arrived. They urged the nurses to finish up so we could leave right away. Derpy Nurse and her BFF complained that they ""Didn't think they'd be ready so soon"" and continued to delay hooking the blood transfusion up and giving me the quarter does of pain meds. 

The transfer from the bed to the was agony and something I've had flashbacks of. But we were on our way, finally. There's nothing I wanted more than to be unconscious. Blood was strangling my lungs and I struggled to breath. On the bright side, now I know what it's like to both drown and bleed to death.

When we arrived at the second hospital, It was like night and day. A group of people, alarmed and saying ""I didn't know she was a code 3!"" and ""She's already on blood?!"" came to tend to us immediately. The surgeon was ready and radiated calm, compassion and competence and I finally felt like I was going to be cared for. She explained everything quickly and I was under and on the way to surgery in under 10 minutes. Someone led poor Mike to the lobby to wait. 

They drained 2 liters of blood from my abdominal cavity. For context, the human body usually holds 5 liters.

The surgery and recover was actually not that bad. What's really bad now is the anemia. I am so weak. There are so many unnecessary layers my husband and I have to grieve. I didn't need to almost die. If they had just given me the sonogram, I wouldn't have ruptured. It's bad enough I lost my baby and part of my fertility, but the experience in the ER was primeval. Actually, I take that back. A primeval Doctor would have at least loaded me up on whatever now-illegal substance they thought would help. They couldn't even muster up a scrap of emotion when they told me my baby was lost. 

Did they think we were poor and were trying to score opiates because we went to the ""poor"" hospital? I didn't even take the oxycodone they sent me home with. Did they think I was a hysterical little woman who couldn't deal? I can't wrap my head around the lack of urgency and compassion for someone who was bleeding to death in front of them. Even if they were completely sexist or classist, my vitals where causing alarms to go off. I was fainting. That's hard data. How far must your head be up your ass to ignore that? I honestly think I would have died if my husband wasn't constantly chasing them down.

There are so many levels for me to work through. Thanks for reading, those of you who stuck through this. ",t2_3p3uihm,False,,0,False,"Introduction Post: My ectopic pregnancy and medical system hell.

&nbsp;

This is my intro post. I don't feel up to telling/writing down the whole story of my beautiful daughter just yet, but the short version is as follows.  
I was pregnant with our third child. She was supposed to be the icing on our cake. But at 28+3 weeks pregnant she just stopped moving. Completely unexpected, our baby girl's heart had stopped beating. She was born November 4th. (We didn't get an autopsy done and bloodwork on me and biopsy of the placenta and cord have given us no answers whatsoever.)

&nbsp;

Very soon after the birth it just felt right for my husband and I to still want another baby. I know we can't get our girl back and I will still be grieving even if I do get pregnant again soon.  
I've been reading here for a few days/weeks and this seems like a very supportive community, so, hello everyone.

&nbsp;

Our current 'timeline'...  
I still haven't gotten a period after the birth of my daughter (9 weeks ago). I had a check-up at the OB 3 weeks ago. She saw a mature follicle and said I could ovulate any moment, but now, 3 weeks later, still no period. (I stupidly got my hopes up already, but a blood test yesterday turned out to be negative.) I have no patience and I'm pretty anxious about what's going on. (If my baby could just die out of nowhere, anything seems possible, so in my mind, my period not coming means all kinds of awful things, while most likely, it's just stress.

Here's a little about my journey. In 2010, I was diagnosed with a complete vaginal and uterine septum, way before TTC was even a thought in my mind. I waited until April 2015 to have my resection surgery and went to one of the best doctors for the procedure. It went well and was told I know had a normal uterus.

I became pregnant in July 2016 and had my first loss the next month, in August, at 9 weeks 1 day -- while on vacation on a mediterranean cruise. (We found out about the pregnancy a few weeks before the trip and the doctors gave us the all clear to travel. If there had been any doubt in their minds, we would have canceled.) It's a crazy long story that includes a trip on a medical airplane, an emergency D&C, blood transfusion and more.

I then got my second positive in November 2016 and my second miscarriage the next month at 9 weeks 4 days, requiring a D&E. Testing for the second loss came back normal, so I had a complete RPL panel done and they found nothing wrong. So I went in for a hysteroscopy with my original surgeon, who removed some residual septum, retained placental tissue, and some polyps. After that, I went for a second opinion and after further extensive testing, was given the all clear.

I then got pregnant for the third time in August 2017 and pretty much immediately started bleeding. I miscarried at home over the course of a week. My doctors and I agree that the third loss was most likely a chromosomal abnormality, but I underwent further imaging of my uterus which reveals there was STILL significant septum at the top of my uterus. So I went to a world renowned specialist in Boston who has this crazy surgical technique and got that removed. I say crazy because it took 5 minutes and I was fully awake for it - no anesthesia or pain meds. My husband and I watched on a screen while he snipped away it my uterus.

If anyone has questions about uterine septums don't hesitate to reach out. I have a lot of opinions about the diagnosis, treatment, and follow up of the whole procedure. I hope that my story can help others.

Also, I highly recommend travel insurance. Saved our butts during our devastating first loss.

We had transferred 2 embryos and both had taken.  Unfortunately one of my sons’ water broke at 16 weeks.  We were told to expect to lose both babies as most likely I would go into early labor or they would have to induce labor as I would develop an infection.  For 8 weeks we waited for the worst and towards the end my son’s fluid levels went back up to normal levels.  Although I never saw him move again on any of the many, many ultrasounds.  At 24 weeks,  my doctors were optimistic that our one twin would survive, but unsure of the twin whose water had broken as the his lungs may not have developed properly.  At my 31 week appointment, my OB could not find a heartbeat for Ben and he had passed away in July 2016.  I continued the pregnancy and gave birth to his twin in August  2016.  

I think I was in crisis mode during the pregnancy so I didn’t really begin to grieve Ben until his brother was born.  I was eager to be pregnant again right after he was born, but we had to wait to try due to C-section.  We started trying in June, but with infertility, MFI for him, autoimmune/age for me that resulted in nothing so back to the RE.  We have a transfer scheduled for one of our embryos from our previous IVFs next week.  

I’m anxious we have a long road of treatments ahead of us and I’ll never get pregnant again.  I faced so much failure and heartbreak already and I’m scared to go through more.  I’m bitter we have to go through fertility treatments again to have a shot LC.  Then I feel guilty that I’m not grateful enough that I beat the odds to have my LC.  But it can get lonely  sometimes when I know so few people IRL who  have had to deal with both infertility or pregnancy loss and I don’t think I know any who have had to deal with both IRL.

I've had a fair amount of time off, and while I felt supported by my direct supervisor, I didn't feel that same support from my manager.

I went on a little tangent in my annual review, and said that I didn't feel supported, that I felt that I was expected to be 'over' the death of my daughter's, and that what I am going through has been minimised because my daughters were pre-term and not 'real' babies in their eyes.

To their credit, my manager took my views on board and admitted that they could have done more to support me. I now have a meeting with my manager and HR next week to discuss what they can do.

The problem is, now I'm having trouble defining what I need, other than ""Understand when I have time off or spend 40 minutes crying in the bathroom"". So I'm turning to you guys.

I’m a member of the TTC after loss club myself, sadly. I have one living son and had a loss early in 2017. I very recently found out I am pregnant again after almost a year of TTC. In this same year, my SIL had an especially traumatic miscarriage and is not coping well with it. (I’m not judging, these are her words). 

Although it’s hard for me to get mentally to the place where I am comfortable telling people about this pregnancy (provided we don’t suffer another loss—which is possible and at the forefront of my mind always), I do realize that if our scans go well, we will probably want to share the news sometime in the 2nd or 3rd trimester. I am struggling with how to tell my SIL about this, because if they are still TTC, it will be upsetting to her. I’ve been there. Hearing pregnancy announcements is like a knife to the heart when you’re TTC after loss. Should I forgo a public Facebook/IG announcement completely? Should I call or text SIL to tell her and then do a public announcement? I’m not sure how I would want to be told, and I’ve been in her shoes. I would love input from you.

I should add that since our loss and struggle to conceive, I find most pregnancy announcements somewhat tacky.

I feel old, but I’m only 30. I have had one missed miscarriage and a chemical in a span of four months. The missed miscarriage was found at 10 weeks. It was only measuring 7 weeks and had no heartbeat. I chose the misoprostol over the D&C because I’m scared of surgeries. 

It felt like it took forever for my cycles to regulate after that. I got another positive pregnancy test December 17th, 5 days before my period was supposed to start. I waited until my missed period to call my doctor and they couldn’t even see me until January 8th. I tested every day hoping that it would still say positive. On Tuesday my line was super faint, but I didn’t worry too much because it was one of those internet cheapie tests and I thought maybe it was defective. I started spotting Wednesday and got into the doctors right away. Their urine test was negative so they drew blood. The next day I got a call saying my HCG was 20 and they wanted to retest on Friday. By the time Friday came I was bleeding very heavily but they still wanted to test my blood. I won’t know the results until Tuesday due to the holiday but I’m almost 100% positive my levels dropped. I had two days of very heavy bleeding with horrible cramps. Today I’m barely spotting. The nurse tried reassuring me that I could still be pregnant but I know that’s not the case. 

I’m still going to my January 8th appointment to hopefully talk to my doctor about what is going on and to test me for things like blood clotting disorders. 

I cried today because I found out that three of the students that I had last year that graduated are pregnant. It’s just not fair that others that aren’t even trying are able to keep their pregnancies. My husband doesn’t understand why I’m so upset and tells me that we will keep trying and that it will happen. He says that I can obviously get pregnant since I’ve gotten pregnant twice in four months so at least one of them will stick. I just want answers as to why this is happening to me and I’m hoping my doctor will agree with testing me even though I’ve only had two miscarriages. 

I’m hoping my cycle isn’t wonky after this. I’ll still temp and use my LH test strips.

I had my second consecutive loss on Friday, November 24th. It was a natural MC this time (I had a D&C the time before). I was out of town visiting my FIL for Thanksgiving and had my HCG levels tested after seeing my doctor when I returned home (two weeks later, it was a long horrible wait). They were low- 47 on December 7th, 17 the following week, and in 8 the week after that. The nurse was proud to say that 8 was close enough and that I had ""graduated"" from blood draws and could go on my merry way.

I did an OPK for the heck of it a few days after my 47 HCG result and it was very very faint. I did it again for the heck of it between getting the 17 HCG result and the 8 HCG result and it was either positive or very close (I have trouble determining that on the cheap strips sometimes). I know that it wasn't a positive due to HCG being in my system seeing as I had done it the week before with a negative result.

So what the heck is my question?.... Was my HCG low enough to have ovulated at that point or was that test a fluke result? I assumed that the level would have to be 0 for in order for ovulation to take place... but what the heck do I know? I have been taking OPK's here since my ""graduation"" from having my beta tested and they have all been negative. I have had some very light spotting this evening, so I am thinking AF is coming, which would put me 12 or 13 days after the positive OPK (which would make sense).

I know that it wasn&#39;t a positive due to HCG being in my system seeing as I had done it the week before with a negative result.</p>

<p>So what the heck is my question?.... Was my HCG low enough to have ovulated at that point or was that test a fluke result? I assumed that the level would have to be 0 for in order for ovulation to take place... but what the heck do I know? I have been taking OPK&#39;s here since my &quot;graduation&quot; from having my beta tested and they have all been negative. I have had some very light spotting this evening, so I am thinking AF is coming, which would put me 12 or 13 days after the positive OPK (which would make sense).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

I have been reading this sub for a while and want to stop lurking and seek some support. I have lost 3 pregnancies, had a chemical pregnancy, and have now had so many invasive, expensive tests that haven't yielded any helpful answers other than that I need to take vitamins. 

This October, after having biweekly scans for the whole of my first trimester, I felt like something was wrong (very light spotting and cramping, but mostly just a sinking feeling and terrifying suspicion that something was not right) and went in to see my specialist, who did another scan and told me my cervix was a little but short but not short enough to go on bed rest. He sent me home with orders to not exercise and take it easy. The next morning, I had a big contraction while showering for work. A few hours later my water broke. I was 14 weeks. Then, after going home to rest for a few days with little to no amniotic fluid and already starting to grieve the likely loss of yet another baby, I delivered my baby under somewhat traumatic circumstances at the local ER and had a D&C. 

This loss is different than the others. 

I had been watching my baby grow. She was developing wonderfully. I had been to two specialists and been cleared (more like dismissed as being overly concerned as I had *just* had two losses previously and didn't *need* to be concerned this pregnancy would go wrong). This one is different because I had told more family and more friends and even my work because my pregnancy was going to really change my work circumstances. This one is different because I was planning (baby showers and daycare and maternity leave and baby names and hopes and dreams) and thinking and praying and trying to do all the right things. It is different because there is no place for my feelings, my grief, in my life right now. This one is different because my sister forced her nursery furniture, infant clothes, and toys on me years ago and now that is serving as a constant reminder of my loss. I know she was trying to be helpful. 

I waited and waited to have children because my husband wasn't ready - I decided to get a doctorate instead, which has been hella difficult on our relationship, finances, and my mental health. Now I am grieving the loss of the future I have wanted so long and feel like everyone around me is just expecting me to be better and be ready to try again. Especially my husband, who says nothing when I burst into tears. Now I am months away from completing my doctorate (if I can get my dissertation done, which is not exactly easy to work on right now because I am barely functioning).

I have now been to three different specialists and have been diagnosed with an MTHFR mutation, a blood clotting disorder, and endometritis. So many other, potentially more scary things, have been ruled out. Which is not all that reassuring. Because I don't know why this happened. Or if it will happen again. I am too devastated to think about starting over again, but I am trying to hang on to hope for the life that I want. I know there will be a baby in my future. 

I am finding the need to educate myself on current medical journals so that I can be an informed patient - one of my doctors wanted to install an IUD for 6 months as it *might* help clear up inflammation in my uterine lining. This was before the endometritis was even diagnosed. A different doctor did the endoscopy. The same (first) doctor was going to prescribe Lovenox (blood thinner) and steroids for the blood clotting issue and inflammation. These drugs are potentially harmful, but do not have proven benefits for pregnancy outcomes according to a journal article I read and the other, new, doctor. Now I'm not sure which doctor to go with for my care - or if I am even ready to try again. Ready or not, I like will be trying again next month.

I had a loss at 20 weeks back in October of this year. This was my 4th pregnancy (1 MMC, 1 healthy term baby, 1 early MC previously). Normal pregnancy initially with 2 normal scans and 1st trimester screening. We went for our anatomy scan at 19 weeks and my world fell apart. Baby had zero amniotic fluid and was measuring 16 weeks. Was sent to perinatology who diagnosed a likely chronic abruption, although I never had pain or bleeding. Blood flow through the placenta was so bad her heart was failing. Her passing was imminent. Even if we made it to “viability” she would have no functional lungs and would be too small to survive.  She was also starting to be compressed by my organs and had no room to move.  I had a D&E a couple of days later as I didn’t want her to suffer any further.
Other than a crummy clotted placenta, all tests on her and me were unrevealing. We met with the perinatal people again yesterday to discuss what happened and if we could try again. He diagnosed CAOS Syndrome. No good reason why this happened- just bad luck. He thought it would not happen again but this Syndrome is rare so couldn’t give me a numerical risk.
So here I am. Trying for my 5th pregnancy. I am terrified of getting pregnant again but I feel like the longer I wait the worse it will be. There is no “safe time”. I cant imagine wanting to tell anyone about a future pregnancy until the 3rd trimester. I will not be happy or content in pregnancy until I have a crying baby in my arms again.

My daughter was born on 11/30 after a normal pregnancy with normal genetic tests and a normal anatomy scan. We took her home. But she was very lethargic. Everyone we talked to attributed this (and her lack of interest in feeding) to being born at 37 weeks. And in 99.99% of babies, they would've been right. Yet after a week at home, she still wasn't turning a corner and ""waking up,"" as everyone (pediatrician, home health nurse, lactation consultant) predicted. Off to NICU we went. After ruling out acute causes for her state, we got into chronic conditions. And were diagnosed with a terrible and rare genetic syndrome: Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy. Her particular case was extreme and there was no chance for any kind of normal brain activity. Basically, within three days, we went from thinking we had a sick baby to learning we had a pre-terminal baby.

We took her home from the NICU and loved the heck out of her. We snuggled her every chance we got. She was always on one of our chests. Our plan was to repeat the brain scan in a week and then pull the feeding tube if the prognosis was still the same (which we were fully expecting). Before we could, she had an apnea episode and passed away for about ten minutes. It was very sudden at first, then she brought herself back, which was horrible and surprising to experience. She was on her way out after that. We had a hospice nurse with us and administered medications to calm the seizures that started because she was without oxygen for so long. (Not that brain damage was one of our concerns, since her brain was already the problem.) The process took eight hours. It was an honor to walk with her as far as we could go. Even though we knew she was home to pass away, we still wanted more time. We were expecting weeks, because of what the hospice team told us might happen. We only had her for two days once she was discharged.

I miss her so much, but she was never going to be capable of life. Most children with her condition die within two years. She was obviously very sick, because she lived for sixteen days and needed feeding and oxygen support. There was no chance for her to ever experience anything. She was not conscious of anything, ever, even in utero, as it turns out. This was not the baby that we dreamt of (even though we loved her and always will). 

My body thinks I should have a baby. My brain thinks I should have a baby. My boobs think I should have a baby (I was pumping all of her food and have finally weaned this week). My hormones think I should have a baby. It is so hard to sit here without a baby. We do want to try again. We have to do IVF to procreate because of a sperm issue. Our genetics specialist (not connected to the IVF clinic, so there's no bias) doesn't think this happened because of IVF. We are still waiting to figure out if this was a random mutation or if it was inherited because we're silent carriers. Our son was born healthy, as far as we know. Though there are other disorders under this umbrella that manifest later in childhood, which is now my new nightmare. We will need to figure out what our odds are of having another child with this, and if our remaining embryos are affected. There's a long road ahead of us, but at least now we will know why this happened and how to proceed. I want to grieve and honor our daughter, but I also want that baby that we made room for in our hearts and our family and our home. Our RE wants us to wait six months before we try again, for the sake of my body. I think that's a good amount of time. I am ready to have a baby in my arms right this moment, but I do recognize that I need to heal physically and grieve emotionally.

My daughter was born on 11/30 after a normal pregnancy with normal genetic tests and a normal anatomy scan. We took her home. But she was very lethargic. Everyone we talked to attributed this (and her lack of interest in feeding) to being born at 37 weeks. And in 99.99% of babies, they would&#39;ve been right. Yet after a week at home, she still wasn&#39;t turning a corner and &quot;waking up,&quot; as everyone (pediatrician, home health nurse, lactation consultant) predicted. Off to NICU we went. After ruling out acute causes for her state, we got into chronic conditions. And were diagnosed with a terrible and rare genetic syndrome: Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy. Her particular case was extreme and there was no chance for any kind of normal brain activity. Basically, within three days, we went from thinking we had a sick baby to learning we had a pre-terminal baby.</p>

<p>We took her home from the NICU and loved the heck out of her. We snuggled her every chance we got. She was always on one of our chests. Our plan was to repeat the brain scan in a week and then pull the feeding tube if the prognosis was still the same (which we were fully expecting). Before we could, she had an apnea episode and passed away for about ten minutes. It was very sudden at first, then she brought herself back, which was horrible and surprising to experience. She was on her way out after that. We had a hospice nurse with us and administered medications to calm the seizures that started because she was without oxygen for so long. (Not that brain damage was one of our concerns, since her brain was already the problem.) The process took eight hours. It was an honor to walk with her as far as we could go. Even though we knew she was home to pass away, we still wanted more time. We were expecting weeks, because of what the hospice team told us might happen. We only had her for two days once she was discharged.</p>

I can't help but think I should be doing stockings for 4 this year: mommy, daddy, our 2 year old and a newborn. Like a weeks old baby, if even a full week old. I should have tons of teeny tiny baby clothing in bags to be opened in the morning and cute baby books. Instead I only have 3 stockings to prepare. 

I was did with our loss sometime in mid/late December (don't remember the exact date but still it was supposed to be around Christmas I was due). I can't help but be sad that this is my reality. No super big bump that I'm cursing and ""hating "" because it's getting in the way or a newborn who is stuck to me like Velcro so I can't get anything done plus a 2 year old. No, instead I have a quiet house while my 2 year old sleeps and my husband is upstairs in bed. 

I have so much to be thankful for and be happy for but I can't help but just want to sit and sob and drink all the wine (oh yeah. And I am NOT pregnant this month. All I wanted was to be pregnant by our due date... didn't happen). My husband has been amazing these last couple weeks as I've had a few really major meltdowns over this. Last week I had a huge hissy fit because I got very specifically reminded we should have had a baby around now and I remember him saying ""we will have our little Squishy baby soon "" and I just responded with a pouty and teary  ""but we should have had our baby now!"" And fell into another puddle of tears. 

We got our yearly Christmas ornaments and he asked if I wanted to get an ornament for our Squid (I started referring to our baby we lost as Squid because I hate referring to things as ""It"") and I started to melt down at the little kiosk. So many people I know and so many people in my pop culture circle are announcing pregnancies and I'm overjoyed for them but at the same time it just makes me hate everything and want to know why. Why us?why can't we seem to get pregnant. With my son it took 2 months, our loss was an accidental one time mistake and we were pregnant. Why this time it's been over 6 months of no luck. I can't help but think maybe this is it. I only get to have 1 baby and that's it. I went into my marriage wanting 3 babies. With my first pregnancy we had a very rough time and now have rethought that idea and would be happy with 2 babies. If things go really Well, maybe I'll revisit having a third child. But all I want is 1 more little one to care for.

This is getting rambly so my apologizes. I needed to get this out before I went nuts because it's just eating me up because there's a large part of our families that don't know what happened last spring and I feel like I need to hide what happened to avoid some unneeded bullshit in our lives but it also means bottling up some of the pain.",t2_cnlxz,False,,0,False,Because I know you guys will understand,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_7lzdmk,False,dark,1.0,,public,14,0,{},,8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,14,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1514202669.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Here I am getting stockings ready and presents wrapped.

1. Your children will be the cutest. The littlest of anything is always the most adorable!


2. Your children will be cherished because they're the last babies to pass through.


3. Your children will always have playmates because there are already kiddos around. Cousins are built in best friends! 


4. Less pressure on your children because they're the youngest. If they can read better than your friend or sister's kids, that's amazing because your kids are younger!! If they can't read as well, that's understandable because they're younger. Think of it this way: Your kids can never be outshined by their kids, because even if the older kids do something great, they're older. There's at least a possibility of your kids outshining theirs. 


5. You won't feel like you're missing out on anything social with your friends or siblings, because they're already in parent land, so they're not doing anything non-child related fun. You don't have to be the only one to turn down concert night or Cancun vacation, because those don't happen anymore in your circle. Similarly, everyone will understand when you can't do something.


6. If you're a competitive person or have a rocky relationship with your siblings, you can see how they did everything (nursery, social media announcement, school selections, etc...) and do it better ;-) You always want to go last in a competition.


7. If you have a good relationship with your siblings (and assuredly you do with your friends or you wouldn't be friends with them), then the firsthand-experience advice that they can provide you every step of the way, from TTC to pregnancy to motherhood, is invaluable.


8. Hand-me-downs!!!!!! Even siblings that you don't get along with will prob give you some stuff just to get it out of their house, and even if you save $50 that's amazing!


9. They literally come out with new awesome parenting tools every year.


10. This one is only for the petty at heart: doing something last upstages the first one/s who did it, even if it's a few years later. Being the first may have its novelty of feeling special, but it's not how you start, it's how you finish. People are more likely to remember the last, freshest, most recent and forget about the old news. Also, what's the point of feeling ""special"" when it won't last, because as soon as someone else gets pregnant, first isn't special anymore (This is something you should only be happy about if your siblings or in-laws have been shitty with you.)

It also makes it seem like having children was a natural byproduct of an already happy home, not that the marriage happened just to have kids. It's also a time to save up money so you're better prepared for parenthood, can take longer unpaid leave after birth, etc.

Is this something I should bring up when I go in for my fertility testing? Could it have caused my losses? Could it be why I can't get pregnant again?

Last night my brother in law's girlfriend came over (she knows about the MC) and started talking about her newborn baby cousin she was going to meet for the first time. She was so excited and kept talking about this newborn baby. I went a little bit quiet but didn't say anything. I went outside and was talking to my father in law (he also knows about the MC) and he said that he is excited for 2017 to be over because it's been such a horrible year for us. He then said that he was excited for 2018 to start because grandkids won't be far away. I said 'hopefully' and that was my snapping point. I removed myself and had a little cry outside and my MIL came out and had a chat with me which was lovely. Then the girlfriend came out and entered into the conversation saying how bad 2017 was and how her bosses told her 'not to get pregnant anytime soon'. I kind of lost it... I started bawling my eyes out and ran into my room. DH came in after me and I asked to be alone and asked to make sure nobody came in the room. So he went out, the girlfriend is crying and feels so bad but my brother in law was defending her saying that I shouldn't be so sensitive and blew up basically. DH was telling everyone that it's  still a sensitive topic and trying to calm everyone down. Brother in law and girlfriend left in a huff saying that he couldn't be around anymore.

https://dreaming8.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/my-first-pregnancy-my-ectopic-story/

Yesterday was 3 months since my second surgery.  We had an appointment with a new OB (who specializes in couples with fertility issues) yesterday.  After going through everything with him (the story of the ectopic & loss of right tube, my thyroid history, hormone concerns, etc.) he said there was no reason we couldn't start trying. 
So, I also happen to be in my peak fertile stage of this cycle (my 3rd since the ectopic).  We discussed before the appointment if we would try immediately if given the all clear, so we are officially TTC again as of last night. 
So, here I am... very excited and very anxious.  For the first time since the loss I'm looking toward the future with more positive thoughts than negative ones, but I'm still terrified of having difficulty conceiving again and future losses.
