My husband and I tried for 2 years before getting pregnant the first time, only to end in early miscarriage (at about 5 weeks) 3 days after we got the positive test. We had an ""oops"" moment and actually ended up getting pregnant the next month, before I had had a ""normal"" cycle (we had intended to give my body a few months to rest first).

Luckily, my second pregnancy resulted in the birth of our son (now almost 5), but was not without complications. I had early progesterone deficiencies and was on supplements for the first 14 weeks. I then was diagnosed with preeclampsia at 33 weeks and delivered our tiny 3 lb. 2 oz. son via emergency c-section at 34 weeks. Luckily we both recovered and he has fully caught up in all milestones now.

2 years ago the husband and I decided to finally TTC again. It was a hard decision as it took a long time to decide to go through with what we knew could potentially be a rough road again. I was pretty much past much hope when I got the positive test again at the end of July. Things seemed to be going well, I had strong symptoms, etc. Then I started another miscarriage at around 8 weeks and was/is absolutely heartbroken.

We are now currently in the waiting stage for me to at least get through one normal cycle before TTC again, and hoping that it happens quickly. I don't think I can go through 2 more years of this. Trying to stay positive, maintain healthy nutrition and fitness habits, take it one day at a time, etc. Thinking I may try some progesterone oil this time around, but know timing is crucial with starting/stopping, so I'm a bit nervous on that front.

We are TTC #1 and got pg on the first try in Jan of this year. Sadly I had an early mc in March. Since then nothing, despite temping, timing, and preseed.

We have been married for a year, so everyone is on 'babywatch'. I told my family about our loss about a month later, so that they would appreciate we were 'trying' and back off. Hubs didn't want to tell anyone and basically said that he was disregarding the pregnancy entirely since it was an early loss. So as if it never happened. I've felt a bit abandoned in that regard, but I had friends to talk to and that was ok. Everyone deals in their own way. 

We are currently on holidays and staying with his side of the family. They are kind and mean well, if a bit loud and boisterous (and kinda redneck I guess). They have no idea that we are TTC or about the loss. So in an attempt to be cute/funny, they literally met me at the door with a pregnancy journal and tons of good-natured but pushy ribbing about wanting a grand baby. Which was pretty painful for me but I just smiled and nodded because there were some people there that I didn't know well and I didn't want to bring it all up right then. 

In an effort to deflect some of the heat off me and onto their son, and in a tiny indirect cry for help, I tried to pull DH into the banter, but he refused to engage and walked away. Which I guess I could have done but it felt rude and I thought I could manage until we got some private time to talk to my MIL. Which didn't happen last night. 

So today I made a comment to DH, when we were alone, that I wished his family would back off and get out of my uterus. Then he basically blamed me for enabling the conversation with them because I didn't shut them down immediately or change the subject. Though I tried to but they are a collective conversational freight train. Never mind the whole (ha ha) preggo book. 

Then I got mad at him for abandoning me with his own family when, IMO, he should be taking point to handle inappropriate jokes, as I would with mine.  

Anyway we squabbled and he got mad at me being mad, and ditched me to go on a long walk. Then I heard him call up his grandma, and he left to go talk to her. I assume about our mc, but maybe just to vent about having such a moody wife. And I'm sitting alone in my MILs house wishing I was anywhere but here. 

Baby making is hard you guys, and not just the biological part.

First, let me just say that I'm not a huge poster on Facebook - and I'm not one of those people who likes to get into drama...hence my post here instead of a bitchy response or serious Facebook message to my friend. Additionally, I felt this way before experiencing my MC - and I'm thankfully ""past"" the very emotional, raw aspect of the MC. 

My friend is a Spanish guy from Barcelona who now works in MN with his American wife and their two boys under the age of 4. He is a Chemistry professor and his wife is a Comparative Literature professor...both very smart, very kind people.

However, it seems as though every time he posts on Facebook it is to complain about being a parent. Today just really pissed me off. Today his status message is: ""Finally, it's Monday morning. Parents of small (and hectic) children, we survived another weekend! ‪#‎FreeAtLast‬""

I just HATE when parents joke about disliking their children. I have another friend who is constantly joking (in person and online) about wanting to give her children away to *anyone* who will have them. Sometimes I just want to get up in their face about it - I mean, I know you're joking, but you sound TERRIBLE. Let's see if you joke about this if your child was actually kidnapped, or if you had to have a conversation with someone whose child was going through cancer or had a horrible accident. It's just gross. I have a dark sense of humor, but joking about not liking your kids just rubs me the wrong way.

So yeah, I'm not going to say anything to my friend on Facebook, but I really feel like making him think again about that kind of mentality. If I had no filter and wanted to ""use my miscarriage"" to make him feel bad, I'd say:

As someone who just suffered a miscarriage - I would like to say that I find your attitudes towards your children not only hurtful to them, but hurtful to all the people who want children but sadly cannot or are having difficulty conceiving. You're a smart man, and I'm sure your children are smart as well - would you like your four-year-old to know that you suffer through your weekends with him? Would you like him to know that you cannot wait to send him to daycare so that you can pay someone to care for your child? Not everyone thinks your harried posts about being a father are cute. I long to be a mother and I will NEVER publicly joke about not wanting my children.

Ugh. Ok, that's my rant. I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this, so please let me know if it is and I will delete it.

49,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"   My daughter's 2nd birthday party was today.  She was my first pregnancy, and it took 2 years of trying to conceive her.  I became pregnant shortly after my husband landed an amazing job.  Everything was looking up for us, and after she was born we were seriously the happiest we'd ever been.  
   When she was 6 month old, my husband was diagnosed with cancer.  It's slow growing, and he had major surgery to remove a lot of it, but he is stage 4 and thus incurable.  We agreed almost immediately after his diagnosis that we still wanted another child.  My husband has years left, and we decided to start trying as soon as he recovered from surgery.
   He was just starting to feel like himself, when I ruptured a disc in my back.  The pain was debilitating, and I was out of work for 3 months while jumping through insurance hoops to get surgery.  Needless to say, this put off our plans of another baby.  I finally had surgery in December, but we waited another 6 months to ensure that I was definitely healed.  The waiting was so frustrating, because time is our enemy.  We never know when my husband will have an appointment that will change our lives.
  We started trying in June.  Since it took so long to get pregnant with my daughter, I didn't have high expectations for a quick conception.  I was hoping to be pregnant by next summer.  I got pregnant the first month we tried.  It was so amazing.  It was like finally, finally, something both good and easy was happening for us.  We were beyond thrilled.  I made plans to announce at my daughter's birthday party, and built the theme around the announcement.
   We had my first prenatal appointment a week and a half ago at 9w 0d.  The baby was measuring 7w 5d, and had no heartbeat.  I'd had zero warning, no spotting, no unusual cramping, nothing.  It was such a kick in the teeth.  Haven't we been through enough?  Are we not allowed to have something good happen?  My husband in particular was devastated.  I decided immediately on a D&C.  I couldn't handle the thought of seeing it, or experiencing it.  My doctor is amazing, she does it under general, and held my hand until I fell asleep.
  So today was the party.  The party that I was supposed to announce at.  It was a good day.  I was afraid I'd be sad, but I wasn't.  The only thing that bothered me all day, were the actions of someone I thought was a good friend.  She knew I was pregnant.  Knew I initially meant to announce at the party.  Knew the plan.  Knew I miscarried.  She is also pregnant, due a week before my due date.  A few days before that awful appointment, she announced her pregnancy on FB, with a picture of her daughter in a ""Big Sister"" t shirt.  Guess what her daughter wore to my daughter's party today?  Literally, the only event that I'd ever have a problem with it.  My other good friend noticed immediately, and reminded me that pregnant friend has always been a bit self involved, and likely didn't think of me when doing it.  She'd probably feel like shit if anyone pointed it out to her, but it still pisses me off.  Of all the fucking days to dress your kid in that shirt?  
   Anyway, I'm trying to stay positive.  I tell myself that if we got pregnant so easily this time, it can happen again.  That this baby would have likely been messed up in some capacity, and I need a sick kid like I need a hole in the head.  I've worked in patient care at a Children's Hospital for years, and I see kids with chromosomal abnormalities all the time.  My body didn't betray me, it did what it was supposed to do, mostly.  I'm still going to have a baby, it just won't be in March.   I just want to fast forward through this part.  I want to get my period so we can start trying again.  I want to be pregnant again, with a baby that I'll get to love and snuggle and nurse.  This part, the hurry up and wait.  This is the fucking worst.

My husband and I have been excited to start a family for quite some time. Last year, we started trying and got very lucky - pregnant by our second ovulation. My pregnancy was progressing normally. No gestational diabetes, no pre-eclampsia, no hypertension. After a completely normal 37 week checkup the day before, I noticed a lack of movement and went to the hospital to get checked out. The worst was confirmed. No heartbeat. That moment was the worst moment of my life. Pure anguish rose up inside me as I began to face this new reality without my son Henry. We had been saying ""okay Henry - any time now!"" If only I had a crystal ball and could see in the future. Because I didn't know anything was wrong. We discovered through autopsy that the placenta was small and he died of hypoxia. I was induced and delivered my son vaginally, held him skin to skin for quite some time, took photos with him and whispered over and over in his beautiful perfect ear ""I'm so sorry baby. I didn't know. I love you so much. I love you forever."" My husband and I had several hours with him before we gave him to the nurse and left the hospital. Leaving the hospital without him, I felt stunned and numb. We have been grieving and mourning our loss since then. It hasn't even been two months. We miss him terribly, but somehow we have found a way to go on and even find joy and laughter. I feel lucky, in a way, that I do not believe in God or fate - I would be a lot angrier if I did. My son didn't make it, but it's not because I was meant to be stronger or he was meant to be an angel...not as far as I'm concerned. He is in our hearts forever. When I get caught by the natural beauty of the world, I think of him and feel close to him. I love him fiercely and consider it my duty as his momma to protect his legacy and memory. I have incredible support around me. My husband is the best, my family and friends have been amazing, and my work has been incredibly accommodating. But we want another baby. We are ready...more than ready. I'm 36 and we hope to have two living children. I will mourn my loss for the rest of my life. We have started trying again.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3fomfy/my_story_trigger_warning_miscarriage_at_9w5d/

I went in today for my follow-up and I had A LOT of questions to ask and I thought I'd post them, along with the answers, for anyone else who would like to know:

Q: I'm LIGHTLY spotting with tiny clots and I passed the fetus on 7/31 and probably the placenta on 8/1. Am I done?

A: Yes - you might spot for another week or so, but women only continue to bleed and bleed if their bodies are having difficulty passing everything. Since you already passed everything, you're body is almost done.

Q: I know I should not have unprotected sex right now (in case of a pregnancy in this time period), but when can my husband and I resume sex?

A: After bleeding has stopped. You can start to use tampons, but you should wait another week (2 weeks from start of MC).

Q: Is it *smart* to try again after the first regular period? Should I wait for two periods?

A: There is no reason not to start trying after the first period after the MC. You want to just get a regular lining in there and then have all of that lining removed before you try again.

Q: When can I expect to get my period?

A: Anywhere from 2 - 7 weeks from now.

Q: I bled red on 7/30 and 7/31. Then it's been mostly clots and spotting - I've never filled a pad. Should I be worried about a thin uterine lining? Is this what could have caused the MC? My period is usually heavy flow for 2 days and then light spotting for one or more days. Is this too thin?

A: No, the way you described your MC sounds very normal. There is no reason to believe that your lining is too thin. Again, women bleed a lot when their body isn't passing. You've already passed everything. 

Q: Is my hypothyroid condition to blame? Last time I tested I was at 1.8 (very good range) - I am very sensitive to my levels (all energy is drained if I'm at or above 3.5). Since the MC my pregnancy fatigue is gone and I feel back to normal (seemingly no thyroid issues). Even though I'm treating my thyroid, could this have caused something? I also have a retroverted uterus, could that have caused an issue? 

A: No - we'll check your levels again (since it's a good time to get them re-checked), but that would not be a reason to MC. Same with the uterus - that did not cause additional problems.

Q: I noticed a pattern in my cycle since I've been tracking since September of '14. Every-other month it is 29 days and the other months have ranged between 31 and 42. Am I not ovulating during the longer months? I conceived in what would have been a 29-day cycle...

A: You probably just ovulate at different times each month. Too much data can be a curse...

Q: How many 6-8 MC do you see? 

A: This is very common - probably 15 out of 100. Yours sounds very normal and common.

Q: I have an ovulation thermometer at home...and I've been using it in the morning just to get into the habit. I have varying waking schedules. Does it matter what time I take my temperature upon waking?

A: No - it shouldn't make much of a difference WHEN you take it, just as long as you take it upon waking and while you're still lying down.

Q: I have a relatively low blood pressure, any cause for concern? Range of 100-110 / 58-70

A: No, that is a low-to healthy range.

Q: Am I now considered high risk since having a MC?

A: No

Q: Am I at a higher risk of having another MC?

A: No

Q: Since I had a MC due probably to ""chromosomal abnormalities"" can you tell me what kind we're talking about? Do I have a very high chance of being a carrier of Downs Syndrome? AKA, do one of us have a translocation? 

A: It's impossible to say what type of issue there was with the fetus. Translocation is very rare - if you continue to have MC, we can test for this, but for some reason, those egg and sperm did not function properly. It could be any number of things, not just Downs.





Ok people, those were all my questions. I pretty much expected a lot of those answers, but I just wanted to ask them to a doctor. Side note: fuck that office. They made me wait 15 minutes past my appointment (pregnant bellies and then a damn *newborn* in the waiting room), then they made me wait ANOTHER 20 minutes in the waiting room, right next to the ultrasound room where someone got to hear a heartbeat and there were jokes and laughs and overall sensations of joy.

I also have an ultrasound tomorrow.

Hello. I've been on here for a few days after having my first pregnancy end in miscarriage on July 30th. It's only been a few days, but in those few days, I've received so much support from this subreddit. I work part-time and I found out about my miscarriage right before the weekend, so I've had a lot of time to sit, think, and read online about this awful side of pregnancy. I found that I wanted to read everyone's story and I've wanted to find people who have had this happen to them (no one I'm close to has had this happen to them or has talked openly about it, so I've clung to the Internet and to this subreddit for solace).

Since I wanted to read about it, I decided I'd post my own story in case someone else feels like I do. 

My husband and I have been married for 4 years and together for 9. He finished his PhD in '13, we had our big ceremony wedding that fall, and then in early '14 we moved to our new town and he started his job. He's 33, I'm almost 32, so we finally thought it was time to start. I just went to Ireland with my mom in May, so I made a point to wait to start until I got back from that trip (Guinness and Galway Hooker beers!) I had said for almost a year to anyone who asked, ""I think we're going to start in June.""

One day (June 7th) my husband suggested we try without a condom. I've been using a period tracker app on my phone and it said my fertile window was starting the next day, so I felt like I *could* get pregnant, but there would be a bigger chance that I wouldn't. 

However, that cycle I just felt like I was pregnant. My small boobs were feeling fuller, but I hadn't missed my period yet. On the 23rd of June, I looked into the mirror and said ""I'm going to be a mom."" Then I thought, ""Why can't I just test now? Maybe I can."" I googled the earliest you could test, and since I was in that window, I took the test. BFP! Shocked, excited, nervous about an impending business my husband and I were going to start (we ended up not doing it), I ran to reddit and thus started my obsession with r/babybumps. 

I was on there every day, multiple times a day (look at my history). Part of me was proud, but also shocked, that it took me and my husband ONE TRY on the FIRST TRY to get pregnant. That was the history with my mom and dad, and since my maiden name rhymes with fertile, my husband and I were making a joke that I was still Fertile - Lastname.

I was having a rainbow pregnancy. Big, but not sore, boobs, mild-to-severe fatigue, and that was it. A large part of me was concerned and pessimistic that this was really possible. After puking once at 8 weeks, I thought I was going to be ok. 

At my 8 week appointment (I was actually 8w5d), my OBGYN told me I was measuring small. I opted out of the ultrasound because I felt it was too early and I had a high deductible. Her telling me I felt small made me worry, but I brushed it aside because I was low-risk and I since I have a tilted uterus, I felt like she couldn't feel all of it anyway.

A week later, I taught an Italian cooking class late into the night, and came home to a bit of old blood when I wiped. I was concerned, but since I had been on r/babybumps all the time, I knew a bit of breakthrough bleeding was normal and nothing to worry about. I called my mom, who's a nurse, and she talked me down too, stating that I was just at the time where I would be missing my 2nd period, so there wasn't really anything to be too worried about. I felt better and went to bed.

The next day, Thursday, there didn't seem to be anything there. I went to work without a panty-liner, and went about my day. However, a bit of old blood was staining my underwear. Annoyed, but not concerned, I got a liner from a co-worker and went back to work. When I got home, however, a large clot came out and I started wiping red blood. My husband was out with a friend mountain biking, so I couldn't talk to him, so I called my mom and she tried to reassure me that it was probably ok - maybe my placenta had torn a bit but that happens. After about an hour, I went back to the bathroom and even more red blood was there. Now I was really starting to freak out.

I sent my husband a text message and called him. I then called the friend he was with. That friend answered and when he realized I was crying, he passed the phone to my husband. My husband went immediately to worse case scenario, thinking I was hurt or something and he couldn't understand what I was saying, so he told me he was coming home. When he drove down the street I could see that he was speeding and he quickly parked on the sidewalk and ran up to the house. 

I wasn't as freaked as he was, so I tried to explain to him what was happening, and then HE urged me to go to the ER. I was apprehensive at first, but he convinced me and he, his friend, and I went to the ER. 

We arrived at 9pm and they hooked me up to an IV and they drew my blood. I was pessimistic and sure I was miscarrying, but my husband and his friend were trying to reassure me everything was fine. The doctor was a big burly guy and he was saying it was probably something with the placenta and hopefully everything would be ok. After talking to him I felt better and was able to laugh a bit with my husband and his friend.

Finally they wheeled me into the ultrasound room where the nurse looked and really questioned my LMP and EDD. She flatly stated that I looked like I was 5 weeks, which reminded me of what my OBGYN stated a week earlier and solidified my fear that I had lost the baby. I said to her ""That's impossible, I knew I was pregnant 5 weeks ago, I'm definitely 9w5d."" and she responded coldly, ""Well, I'm just reading the ultrasound and what I see here."" 

Then she did the transvaginal ultrasound and when I craned my neck to see, she said she was only doing the doctor pictures first - which made me think that she'd show me other pictures once she was done with them. She didn't - which *further* solidified my feelings of a MC. Then the radiologist came in, asked her to show him certain angles and whatnot, and didn't talk to me or explain to me what was happening.

He explained that my doctor in the ER would go over the results and I flatly said ""Ok."" I thought, ""Just tell me I fucking miscarried."" I was crying when we got back to the ER and I was just destroyed.

My husband was still optimistic. I don't know why...probably to make me feel better...but I knew.

After what seemed like ages, my doctor finally came in and explained to me that I had indeed miscarried. He said something about there being an insufficient heartbeat and that I would miscarry soon. The way he said it though seemed like the baby was still alive, but I was going to miscarry. I know that's not what he meant, but that's how it sounded. My husband's first language isn't English, but he is VERY FLUENT. However, he did not understand fully because it was a little confusing, and he said to me after the pelvic exam, ""So there's still hope?"" I was just crushed that even though he was there with me, I still had to say in precise terms that we were losing our baby.

We left the hospital around 1:30am. I don't know how I got to sleep that night, but when I woke up the next morning, I was crying again. I sobbed in the bathroom like I never have before. 

At 2pm I had to go to the OBGYN office to meet with them and to discuss my options. The doctor said that the baby was actually measuring 7w5d, instead of 4 or 5 weeks like they had said at the ER. I was really shocked by this - that means I lost the baby around July 17th or 18th. I opted to MC naturally, which was also what the doctor suggested. The doctor explained that I would have heavy bleeding and cramping in the next few days, and that I was to meet with her a week later to see how things had progressed.

As I was driving home (only about 10 minute drive) I started to get very intense cramps. I started to breath heavily to ease the cramps - almost like they teach you in those Lamaze classes.

When I got home I had the most intense cramps of my life. I couldn't lie down, I couldn't stand, all I could do was sit on the toilet to feel any kind of relief. I tried to do some computer work, but I was in so much pain it was crazy. I didn't realize that I was having labor pains because I never went though labor, but now looking back I can totally see that my cervix was opening and I was trying to pass the baby.

My mom suggested that I put a heating pad on my belly - so I did that and laid on the couch and watched a bit of tv. I finally felt better, so I got up and went to the kitchen to do some dishes. As I was doing the dishes, I felt a weird sensation in my vagina, like I had just passed a huge clot onto my pad. I thought ""Wow, that was huge, I should go to the bathroom."" I went to the bathroom, and the baby was there. 

I can tell you I was SHOCKED. I had just learned YESTERDAY that I was losing the baby. I yelled ""Omigod, omigod"" and I scooped it up and brought it to the kitchen. Indeed, I was a little under 8 weeks. I had been religiously following my Pregnancy+ app, and it looked just like the little fetus on week 7. The thing that kills me is that the baby looked fine. Yes, it was just barely out of the tadpole stage, but it was out of it with little tiny legs and little webbed hands - and a mouth. I couldn't believe the mouth.

I frantically called my husband who said he was coming home soon, and then I went online to see *what to do* with my tiny baby. Since we're renting, I didn't want to bury it in our backyard, and I didn't want to think of it outside in the ground. I decided, with my husband, to bury him or her in our gorgeous jade plant that looks like a tree. I said a few words and my husband cried. My husband isn't a crier, so it moved me and made it all the more real for both of us. 

Before the MC, we kept the jade plant on our screened-in porch on the table. It's still there, and I look at it whenever we have drinks or eat dinner out there.

It's Monday, and this only happened on Friday, so this is all still so raw for me. I want so bad to be a mother, and I am so ready to start a family with my husband. He has promised me that we would try again as soon as we are ready - which I hope is the cycle after my next period. 

I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but the thing that is tearing me inside is the complete distrust of my own body. How can I get pregnant again? How can I carry another baby and not miscarry? I can't imagine ever bringing a healthy baby to term. I feel as though this experience has ruined my otherwise joyful expectations of pregnancy. And on top of all this, I don't want to fucking wait for this bleeding to be over, then my next period, then my fertile window, and then another fucking 40 weeks to have the baby *IF* I get pregnant right away. I already put 9 weeks and 5 days in the bag! How can that be for nothing?! 

Now I find myself desperately searching for older women who have one child or women who have had miscarriages who now have children. I want to hear all about the 2nd pregnancy that's successful and the many children that follow a miscarriage. I'm just so worried and so negative.

So that is where I'm at now. I'm not bleeding much, which I expected, but I'm going to meet with my OBGYN on Wednesday and she can tell me if everything is progressing normally. 

I feel like now I am part of a silent group of women who have gone through something so tragic - and I just want to hug and listen and grieve with you all. I will no longer look at a pregnant woman again without wondering if she's not really a FTM, but a woman who is scared and hopeful and happy to be as far along as she is. 

I hope we all have successful pregnancies. Thank you for reading.

<p>I frantically called my husband who said he was coming home soon, and then I went online to see <em>what to do</em> with my tiny baby. Since we&#39;re renting, I didn&#39;t want to bury it in our backyard, and I didn&#39;t want to think of it outside in the ground. I decided, with my husband, to bury him or her in our gorgeous jade plant that looks like a tree. I said a few words and my husband cried. My husband isn&#39;t a crier, so it moved me and made it all the more real for both of us. </p>

<p>Before the MC, we kept the jade plant on our screened-in porch on the table. It&#39;s still there, and I look at it whenever we have drinks or eat dinner out there.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Monday, and this only happened on Friday, so this is all still so raw for me. I want so bad to be a mother, and I am so ready to start a family with my husband. He has promised me that we would try again as soon as we are ready - which I hope is the cycle after my next period. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if anyone else feels this way, but the thing that is tearing me inside is the complete distrust of my own body. How can I get pregnant again? How can I carry another baby and not miscarry? I can&#39;t imagine ever bringing a healthy baby to term. I feel as though this experience has ruined my otherwise joyful expectations of pregnancy. And on top of all this, I don&#39;t want to fucking wait for this bleeding to be over, then my next period, then my fertile window, and then another fucking 40 weeks to have the baby <em>IF</em> I get pregnant right away. I already put 9 weeks and 5 days in the bag! How can that be for nothing?! </p>

<p>Now I find myself desperately searching for older women who have one child or women who have had miscarriages who now have children. I want to hear all about the 2nd pregnancy that&#39;s successful and the many children that follow a miscarriage. I&#39;m just so worried and so negative.</p>

<p>So that is where I&#39;m at now. I&#39;m not bleeding much, which I expected, but I&#39;m going to meet with my OBGYN on Wednesday and she can tell me if everything is progressing normally. </p>

<p>I feel like now I am part of a silent group of women who have gone through something so tragic - and I just want to hug and listen and grieve with you all. I will no longer look at a pregnant woman again without wondering if she&#39;s not really a FTM, but a woman who is scared and hopeful and happy to be as far along as she is. </p>

<p>I hope we all have successful pregnancies. Thank you for reading.</p>

I recently lost my twin boys at 22 weeks due to incompetent cervix and chorioamnionitis that resulted from the IC. I was 4 days short of when my hospital would have considered them viable. They each lived only minutes. This is by far the hardest thing I have ever gone through in my life, and I miss my babies more than anything. I would do anything to bring them back.

It took me 9 years (10 years in November), multiple surgeries and procedures, and IVF/FET to finally conceive them (I also had 4 early losses during that time). Pregnancy does NOT come easily to me, as I have a multitude of things wrong with me reproductive-wise.

The two paths that we are considering taking going forward: 

Transabdominal cerclage: All doctors involved in my case (RE/OB/MFM) have stated that I would need a TAC (as opposed to a TVC) if I were to ever get pregnant again. I have a phone consultation scheduled with a specialist (Dr. Haney) on the 12th of this month. Based on his email correspondence with me, I would need above and beyond a normal TAC - I would need 3 bands placed instead of 1. He said that since this is less common, success rates are harder to determine, but he stated an approximate success rate of 90%. Now, my concern is that the shit that tends to happen to me is in the 1-2% probability range. A 10% chance of something happening is huge to me. How can I risk something like what happened with the twins happening again? Has anyone looked into and/or gotten a TAC?

Surrogacy: We would prefer surrogacy at this point (take my stupid broken body out of the equation completely), but it's very expensive. We are looking at around $60,000 for an independent, non-agency agreement. We got rid of two cars, moved in with my parents so that we can sell our house, and I'm getting a second job - but even then I would need to take out a huge personal loan to be able to make this happen.

----

Introduction -- I have a 2 year old daughter who was born by c-section after a mostly uneventful pregnancy. A few months ago, my husband brought up the idea of getting started on another baby. I was lukewarm to the idea because our daughter still nurses, still cosleeps, and is a kind of needy kid -- I thought maybe we should wait until she was older and more independent. But I also thought it would take a while to get pregnant, maybe 6 months-ish, and then the pregnancy itself lasts for a while.

And then before we had even formally started trying, I got a positive test -- we were being pretty lax with protection but I thought it was very unlikely we would get pregnant (sex 5 days before ovulation).

It was hard for me to get excited about the pregnancy at first, which I now feel incredibly guilty about. I felt like I wasn't ready, my daughter wasn't ready, I wasn't sure what to do about work and money and blah blah everything. So I spent 2 months acclimating to the idea, getting myself a little excited, and explaining things to my daughter.

Then at my 12 week scan, we found a missed miscarriage (lots of details in my submission history, I seem to be unable to stop talking about this on reddit). I had a D&C last Wednesday and feel fine physically. But very sad. 

The pregnancy was very unpleasant (another thing I feel guilty about now) and I am anxious to get the next horrible first trimester behind me. I don't want to wait to try again, so I plan to take HCG tests every day until I get clear negatives, then OPKs every day until a clear positive.

I know that anything can happen and it could take months to regulate, but I am just hoping to hear what other people's experiences have been.

But then...Mother Nature decided that was not going to be right for us. Instead of just not having it happen for us, she dangled that carrot in front of us and then yanked it away! Why give me symptoms and tests that gave me hope and pull it away?!?!? I never imagined I would be so saddened and so ANGERED by the loss of a being I had known about for only 10 days...and the emotional pain is beyond what I expected.

I knew I was MCing yesterday at 5w1d. I just felt it... So, I called the OB and went in for a HCG level. 16. I go in Monday for another to make sure it is going negative...then I guess we try again.

Now I sit here in a not great place hoping to find help and solace from those who have unfortunately undergone this same awful, terrible, horrific experience...

My questions are: 
~ How long were people told to wait before trying again? 
~ Did people get a period shortly after finishing bleeding? 
~ How long did people take to O again after? 
~ How long did the MC bleeding go on for (with natural)? 
~ Any advice on dealing with the emotional struggle of anger and sadness? (Other than trying to focus on the fact that we know we CAN get pregnant...) 
~ With so many statistics online, what are people's experiences with future pregnancies after a MC/CP? 
~ How do I stop feeling like this is my fault??? (This one is pretty rhetorical....)

I have been laying pretty low and lurking occasionally this past week. Today was my followup hCG to make sure it was dropping.  My period started on Tuesday and it has been bad.  Today's result 798! I have an ultrasound appointment in 30 minutes to find out what the f#ck. 798 would be consistent with doubling every 48 hours since last week but there is no way a baby could survive this period.  I have been drinking and quit taking my prenatal vitamins. All of my ""pregnancy"" symptoms disappeared a week ago but I have gained 5 pounds in a week. WHAT THE F#CK. I'm not sure how to stay sane in the next 30 minutes.

**UPDATE**:  the products of conception caused my beta to soar. It had progressed to 5w3d but there was no fetal pole or heart beat.  It isn't ectopic which was good.

I have an ultrasound appointment in 30 minutes to find out what the f#ck. 798 would be consistent with doubling every 48 hours since last week but there is no way a baby could survive this period.  I have been drinking and quit taking my prenatal vitamins. All of my &quot;pregnancy&quot; symptoms disappeared a week ago but I have gained 5 pounds in a week. WHAT THE F#CK. I&#39;m not sure how to stay sane in the next 30 minutes.</p>

My husband and I have lost two pregnancies, one at 7 weeks a couple years ago, and another in April. They were both surprises, although the first was less excited about. Timing was absolutely terrible, but not the second time. It seemed to be bad timing, with my husband leaving his military career along with our insurance and an impending move across the globe from Europe, but we were thrilled!! We changed our plans from moving to a new state to going back home to help us ride out a baby with family around. I registered for baby gear under an alias before telling our families, and really just to price how much we'd need to be prepared for before losing our jobs. We only told our closest friends and our parents, and both my best friend in Europe and my best friend at home were both pregnant with me! Expecting within a week of each other!

Then came that dreaded appointment, which was very unclear with a minor language barrier, but to the effect of ""yeah.... I don't think it's viable. Brace yourself for a miscarriage. Bye!"" No certainty or reliability at all. Mind you, I was told at 6 weeks that it might be ectopic.... It wasn't. I had no faith in my doctor and extremely limited options in a foreign country. I was told to wait two to three weeks to come back, and that it should be gone by then. ""Should"". Like it better not be there when you come back! I was horrified and in denial and depressed. For three weeks. All the while hearing about how sick my friends are and everything looks great and early 3D ultra sounds. I wanted to cry. So I did. Everyday for at least a month.

It eventually happened naturally, which just made it harder. I wish I could have been confident in my doctor's opinion and been able to heal faster with a D&C. 

Now we're home, and I started a new job with benefits a month ago. It's been 3 cycles of me desperately wanting to replace what feels to have been robbed from me. My husband could wait, and I wish I could but I just can't. I've only taken 4 per stick tests in my life and they were all positive. I know my body, and in a crazy pms mood I thought maybe I could just take one a little early and it will just be positive like all the others. Because it could be! Ridiculous, but hopeful. Either way, I went all out and bought a 3 pack. 2 down. Not pregnant. There goes my ""logic"". I keep thinking this is the cycle!! Not the previous two, but this one!! I'm ready again, we're settled, it can happen and I need it to for my own mental and emotional well being! We already know we're crazy fertile. I hate this. I want my baby back. I'd be 23 weeks today. My clothes are still in storage and I'm getting them back on Thursday and I'm terrified of the emotions that will come out when I see the maternity clothes I bought while we still had income.

Didn't mean for this to be a novella, but this shit sucks and I cant be as patient as I'm told. Wish I could, but it's only driving me deeper into insanity. This isn't who I want to be.

Then I somehow got pregnant, on birth control, in February of this year...I found out in March and we were SO excited. Our entire lives changed in that moment.

Unfortunately, my 10w4d ultrasound did not give me good news. There was no heartbeat. =/

The baby was measuring exactly 10w4d so they think it was an incredibly recent occurrence (within 24 hours). It was a complete shock, as I had NO miscarriage symptoms and plenty of 1st trimester sickness/""fun"". I just thought things were moving right along...I didn't even know what to think and spent many hours crying. My husband was out of town and that just added to the horrible day.

The doctors said it could take quite awhile for my body to realize the loss and for things to happen naturally. I spent 4 more days, knowing the baby wasn't growing and feeling pregnant and then I chose to have the D&C.  I had that on May 5th, and while I hated it, I am glad I did it. It allowed my body to start getting back to normal sooner, which I think helped me emotionally.

Yesterday was the 3 month anniversary of that ultrasound...and a hard reminder. I think about our baby often and milestones really hurt. Different communities here on Reddit have been helpful, and unfortunately I know a lot of women who have had a loss and can relate.
