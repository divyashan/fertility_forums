And Every single stupid pre pregnancy symptom is the exact same as pre period.  So I’ve become pretty good at not getting my hopes up. </p>

<p>So just to throw me for a spin, this month my body said “hey, let’s make you a little more hormonal this time to remind you of how you felt that first time. AND THEN let’s not just make your period and day or two late, but nine.”  CD 39 and I freaking started my period this morning. It’s also our 7 year anniversary, which I wasn’t getting my hopes up about but a little tiny voice inside me thought “wouldn’t that be neat...”</p>

My husband and I have been TTC for 19 months. We had a MMC in May of 2019, and it has been hell ever since. In October 2019, we started going to a fertility clinic for help. They had great reviews, been around for a while...it seemed like the place to go for help.

When i asked my doctor for a recommendation for a prenatal vitamin, he prescribed me one called OB Complete Petite. It costs me about 30$ per month after insurance and has 1000 mcg of Folic Acid.

I couldn't even wait to tell my husband and made him come into the bathroom immediately to confirm over and over again that he could see the lines, they were there, this was happening. My husband was diagnosed with severe MFI and we were told that there was a 1-5% chance of us being able to conceive naturally and that we should start looking into IVF. This felt like a miracle and we were cautiously optimistic that we would be bringing home a baby in January. I felt like we were lucky.

Thursday night I started spotting. Just a few tiny drops of brown blood. The internet said it was normal and nothing to worry about but I am Rh- and my OB said to come in the next day for a rhogam shot and to get a second beta test to make sure everything was doubling correctly. I got the shot and it was slightly painful but not that bad. The nurse kept calling my situation an ""impending abort!on"" which has to be up there with the worst thing you could say to someone who might be going through a miscarriage. The nurse that did my blood test could tell I was upset and said ""don't worry, you're young! You have time to try again!"" It was like a foregone conclusion for them. They knew I was going to miscarry even if I was hoping again hope that they were wrong.

An hour later we got the results from the beta test. I had been at 55 on Monday and now my level was 5. I told my husband that this essentially meant that I wasn't pregnant anymore and watched as he completely dissolved in front of me. I've never seen him cry like that. I don't know how to help him when I feel like I am completely falling apart.

I am now in more pain, physically, mentally, and emotionally than I have ever been in. This ""period"" is the heaviest and most painful period I've ever had and it feels like a giant slap in the face. Or maybe that is for the best, it reminds me that this is over. My body hasn't caught up and my boobs are still heavy and tender.

I don't know how to move on from this. I don't know how to try again. I know I was only pregnant for a week but it feels like this was our one shot. This was our miracle.

They knew I was going to miscarry even if I was hoping again hope that they were wrong.</p>

<p>An hour later we got the results from the beta test. I had been at 55 on Monday and now my level was 5. I told my husband that this essentially meant that I wasn&#39;t pregnant anymore and watched as he completely dissolved in front of me. I&#39;ve never seen him cry like that. I don&#39;t know how to help him when I feel like I am completely falling apart.</p>

<p>I am now in more pain, physically, mentally, and emotionally than I have ever been in. This &quot;period&quot; is the heaviest and most painful period I&#39;ve ever had and it feels like a giant slap in the face. Or maybe that is for the best, it reminds me that this is over. My body hasn&#39;t caught up and my boobs are still heavy and tender.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to move on from this. I don&#39;t know how to try again. I know I was only pregnant for a week but it feels like this was our one shot. This was our miracle. What if it never happens again? How do you regain hope when it feels like all of your dreams have come crashing down around you?</p>

I recently had my first period 37 days after an ERPC in April.  The main bleed was from last Friday through to this Tuesday, and it was nice and heavy (similar to my pre-MC periods) over the weekend.  I would normally have one or two days of brown discharge towards the end, but this one just seemed to stop suddenly on Tuesday after getting lighter over Monday.

Then today (Friday - CD8) I went to the toilet and there was a small amount of dark red blood on my pantyliner.  When I wiped there was a pink trace on the TP and I think a few drops may have come out in the bowl.  After changing pantyliners, nothing like that has come out again, although there is a light brown discharge which I guess might be the tail-end.  I had not/am not experiencing any pain and it seems like it is stopping/has stopped already.

I don't believe this has anything to do with ovulation as my CBAD is at Low, and I would not expect I'm anywhere near mid-cycle yet.

I posted here in January after my second miscarriage and got so many great responses and information from all of the lovely people in this sub. So I wanted to give a bit of an update since as you can see, I am back again. 

TL;DR - asked for info after second loss in January, then had a third loss recently. Updates on testing and results. 

In January, I had a 6 week natural miscarriage and a negative experience with an OB at the practice I was going to. After that, I found a new practice with a new OB who is absolutely the greatest doctor I’ve ever had. He immediately ran some testing for me in March which he thought was appropriate. I had a 7DPO progesterone test, and had my prolactin and fasting glucose tested. My glucose was normal, progesterone was high (27), and prolactin was high (49). Well, it turns out that I actually got pregnant that cycle. Then, I miscarried again. Found out at 11w2d, but it measured 9w1d. I really thought that the first two losses were a fluke. Everyone reassured me that I’m young, healthy, and there’s nothing wrong with me. Yet here I am, again. 

I did want to give an update from a medical standpoint as well. This time I had a D&C and the tissue is being tested for chromosomal abnormalities. That will take a while longer so I don’t have results yet. Also, my OB sent me for some other preliminary testing: antiphospholipid antibodies, prothrombin gene mutation, and DRVVT. I don’t have results from those yet either. I am also seeing an RE in two weeks in hopes that they will do some more. These were suggestions given by some of you guys here, so thank you again! I know there’s other testing that can be run but I would like to see the results from these first. I am also going to push for a TPO test specifically because my sister, mom, and grandma all have hypothyroidism. Even though my TSH has always tested normal (around 2), some of you mentioned that thyroid antibodies may still be elevated.

It’s been so helpful reading through your posts as I’ve tried to get back to normal physically and emotionally.  

My story has lots of twists and turns. (trigger warning - medical trauma, fibroids) My partner and I initially conceived on the first try, but it was stressful from the start as I have always had large fibroids. My mother had them, and her mother, so I knew they made everything extremely risky, but my doctor actually advised trying before having them removed because they were inactive and she had treated many women for whom they only caused minor complications. That was a huge mistake. Fed by pregnancy hormones, they grew incredibly fast to the size of apples and small melons and I had several scary near losses and hospitalizations from hemorrhaging during the final months of the pregnancy. My amniotic sac was eventually compromised and I delivered at 20 weeks, then was hospitalized again for two emergency surgeries to remove retained product, then the fibroids, then got sepsis, then lived with a PICC line at home for a month. It was the hardest, worst year of my life...

So it took me a long, long time to get to the point where I’d even consider trying again. Here we are a year and a half later on our first cycle of TTC and I’m absolutely TERRIFIED. My partner and I talk about it frequently, usually in the dark as we’re falling asleep at night, and I feel supported by him but it also doesn’t feel like he gets the physically triggering part. I’m only 3 DPO and already I’m obsessively symptom spotting though I know it’s impossible to know before implantation. I keep remembering the symptoms from my first pregnancy and loss and everything feels meaningful now though it isn’t. Metallic taste in my mouth, nosebleed, hot flashes. And lots of surprise weeping from constant anxiety.

How on earth am I going to make it through this?!

I had a MMC in April at about 10 weeks (after a successful ultrasound too), with a D&C then. (You know those MC probability charts, how they go down at at 10 weeks and after hearing a heartbeat? Huge load of garbage as far as I'm concerned.) I had to delay getting the D&C because I had to go visit a hematologist for surgery clearance which I was initially told would take a week to get into, until my OB's nurse got on the specialist about getting it done more urgently (Turns out, my blood wasn't messed up at all, it was a lab error.)

During the D&C, the doctor noticed what looked ""suspiciously like a polyp"" and has requested I come in for special imaging sometime between day 5 and 9 of my cycle - could be the first post D&C, or any cycle. She's also said that I should wait to try again until this imaging reveals an all clear or we remove it. I want to start my family, and after a few years of dealing with a bum thyroid ""waiting for a specialist visit"" is basically my personal hell, so I wanted to get in as quickly as possible. 

Unfortunately, my first post D&C cycle began pretty much at 5:01 PM on the Friday of a holiday weekend and so I had to wait until this morning to try to schedule an appointment for a very narrow timeframe this week - already a difficult task to do a last minute minor non-urgent procedure. Adding to that, my OBGYN office recently started accepting regular well-woman visits again after two months off for COVID safety, so I'm now competing in a pool of patients who had to postpone their appointments for months already. (I also deeply sympathize with the well-woman patients on that, aforementioned health anxiety and all, and I appreciate my doc trying to keep people safe; just sucks to have this timing all the same.)

Unless somebody last-minute cancels an appointment, it doesn't look like I can have this imaging done this cycle at all.

90,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi y’all, I’m new to this sub. I’ve been lurking here a bit since my loss. I never thought I’d be a part of a sub or group like this, but so thankful to have a community of people for support. I hope I can tell my story, and maybe one less person will feel alone.

I’d always wanted to be a biological mother. I feel like it’s one of my core purposes in this life. Though I’ve always felt that, I’ve also always had this underlying innate feeling that growing my family would not be easy for me. I’d felt this as a kid, even before I knew anything fertility or what it was. As an adult my doctor told me that fears of infertility are normal and most women have them especially if they’ve never been pregnant before. That helped calm me down a bit, but this feeling didn’t feel like general fear, but more like that intuition you get when your gut is trying to tell you something. I’ve tried my best to ignore that feeling my entire life.

So in April of 2019 DH and I began our TTC journey. Cruddy high school sex ed sure made it seem easy to conceive, but it didn’t seem to be the case for us. 2 cycles in to TTC, and my cycles became long and irregular and it was diagnosed that I probably wasn’t ovulating well. I was offered clomid and sent on my way. Since I’d been on birth control for nearly a decade prior to trying, I refrained from taking the clomid to try and give my body time to reset naturally. April 12, 2020 after a year of tears, anger, and what felt like defeat, that illusive second line appeared on my test for the very first time. It finally happened. I was pregnant. To say I was elated would be an understatement.

April 27 2020, I presented to the emergency room 6 weeks pregnant with acute abdominal pain. DH couldn’t come in with me due to the COVID virus restrictions. As I sat in the waiting room alone I fainted and was rushed to the back for immediate testing.

Via ultrasound they’d found my abdomen filled with free floating fluid, and the doctors prepared me for the worst, a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The surgeon was called in, I met with the anesthesiologist, and just like that I was wheeled off to surgery. (This all happened over the course of 3 hours, but time was just flying by for me.)

Nearly two hours later the surgery was over. The surgeon told me the good news; the internal bleeding wasn’t caused by a ruptured ectopic pregnancy but by a ruptured corpus luteum cyst that ruptured an artery. My ovary and tubes were intact, he was able to save my ovary and eggs, and everything’s expected to function as normal. He also removed a mass attached to the outside of the ovary, and had it sent to the lab for testing. When the results came back, it tested positive for fetal tissue. The pregnancy was labeled as a rare ovarian ectopic. And to top off the cake, he found stage 1 peritoneal endometriosis while he was poking around in there.

Since then, I’ve been numb, angry, sad, alone, and everywhere in between. I just feel so cheated. The universe gave me my dreams after a year of trying, and took it away within a matter of hours. Then the universe gave me a time limit with my fertility. On top of that, what happened to me is rare, and it’s hard to find any info on it and it feels very lonely. It feels like this is all a sick joke, like the universe is toying with me. My life has been derailed so hard I’m not even sure where the rails are anymore. I keep hoping I’ll wake up from this nightmare.

I know I lived and I was so lucky to be treated so well at the hospital in the midst of a pandemic.
I know it could’ve been a lot worse if it’d been the pregnancy that ruptured instead of the cyst.
I know peritoneal endo is considered the least sever of all the types.
I know they saved all my eggs/ovaries.

I know there’s a lot of silver linings here, but silver thread doesn’t make the fabric itself any higher quality.

I’m still trying to find a way to honor our baby, as my therapist said that can help with the grief. I have all their positive tests, and I’m thinking of writing them a letter and putting it in a memory box.

I still have an innate desire to become a mother, but I’m not sure where DH or I are in terms of trying. It’s not something we’ve talked about much, yet.  Him feeling like he almost lost me was a lot for him to deal with, and he hasn’t directly said it, but I don’t think he wants to put my life at risk again even if that means we don’t have kids. 
I still have reserves too. My inclinations that our journey will be a hard one has only gotten stronger. The doctors told me the chances of this happening again are slim, but the chances were slim to start with and I’m still part of that small statistic. Plus there hasn’t been a lot of studies on ovarian pregnancies, so there’s not a whole lot of info I can gather on the subject. I’m terrified this will happen again. It’s not something I want to see either DH or I go through again, but would it be worth the risk if we could get one or two littles? I’m not sure right now, as it’s only been 4 weeks since this all happened, and I’m sure my feelings will change as I heal and process.

So here we are again, back to square one it feels like. Feels so defeating. Sigh.

I think the hardest part is just feeling alone. The loss of our baby wasn’t as hard for my husband to grieve, as he was so grief stricken that he could’ve lost me. He’s always there and supportive when I need him, but I still can’t help but feel lonely. Lonely that this is rare and I don’t feel like there’s a lot of people to talk to. Lonely that people keep telling me just to “try again” or “at least you know you can get pregnant now” or some other variation of their good intentions and attempts to be comforting to me, though deep down I know the struggles and how it’s not that simple. Lonely because I no longer feel the life inside of me that once was. 

I know I’ll grieve this and move on and return to a seemingly more normal place eventually, but I’m not there now, and if you’re not either, that’s okay. We don’t have to be. We’re where we are, and where we are is exactly where we’re supposed to be. <3",t2_4oig9jkg,False,,0,False,Back to square one,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_gqxnd1,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,b22615aa-711f-11e4-97ba-12313b0e92a7,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1590530644.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi y’all, I’m new to this sub. I’ve been lurking here a bit since my loss. I never thought I’d be a part of a sub or group like this, but so thankful to have a community of people for support. I hope I can tell my story, and maybe one less person will feel alone.</p>

<p>I’d always wanted to be a biological mother. I feel like it’s one of my core purposes in this life. Though I’ve always felt that, I’ve also always had this underlying innate feeling that growing my family would not be easy for me. I’d felt this as a kid, even before I knew anything fertility or what it was. As an adult my doctor told me that fears of infertility are normal and most women have them especially if they’ve never been pregnant before. That helped calm me down a bit, but this feeling didn’t feel like general fear, but more like that intuition you get when your gut is trying to tell you something. I’ve tried my best to ignore that feeling my entire life.</p>

<p>So in April of 2019 DH and I began our TTC journey. Cruddy high school sex ed sure made it seem easy to conceive, but it didn’t seem to be the case for us. 2 cycles in to TTC, and my cycles became long and irregular and it was diagnosed that I probably wasn’t ovulating well. I was offered clomid and sent on my way. Since I’d been on birth control for nearly a decade prior to trying, I refrained from taking the clomid to try and give my body time to reset naturally. April 12, 2020 after a year of tears, anger, and what felt like defeat, that illusive second line appeared on my test for the very first time. It finally happened. I was pregnant. To say I was elated would be an understatement.</p>

<p>April 27 2020, I presented to the emergency room 6 weeks pregnant with acute abdominal pain. DH couldn’t come in with me due to the COVID virus restrictions. As I sat in the waiting room alone I fainted and was rushed to the back for immediate testing.</p>

<p>Via ultrasound they’d found my abdomen filled with free floating fluid, and the doctors prepared me for the worst, a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The surgeon was called in, I met with the anesthesiologist, and just like that I was wheeled off to surgery. (This all happened over the course of 3 hours, but time was just flying by for me.)</p>

<p>Nearly two hours later the surgery was over. The surgeon told me the good news; the internal bleeding wasn’t caused by a ruptured ectopic pregnancy but by a ruptured corpus luteum cyst that ruptured an artery. My ovary and tubes were intact, he was able to save my ovary and eggs, and everything’s expected to function as normal. He also removed a mass attached to the outside of the ovary, and had it sent to the lab for testing. When the results came back, it tested positive for fetal tissue. The pregnancy was labeled as a rare ovarian ectopic. And to top off the cake, he found stage 1 peritoneal endometriosis while he was poking around in there.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been numb, angry, sad, alone, and everywhere in between. I just feel so cheated. The universe gave me my dreams after a year of trying, and took it away within a matter of hours. Then the universe gave me a time limit with my fertility. On top of that, what happened to me is rare, and it’s hard to find any info on it and it feels very lonely. It feels like this is all a sick joke, like the universe is toying with me. My life has been derailed so hard I’m not even sure where the rails are anymore. I keep hoping I’ll wake up from this nightmare.</p>

<p>I know I lived and I was so lucky to be treated so well at the hospital in the midst of a pandemic.
I know it could’ve been a lot worse if it’d been the pregnancy that ruptured instead of the cyst.
I know peritoneal endo is considered the least sever of all the types.
I know they saved all my eggs/ovaries.</p>

<p>I know there’s a lot of silver linings here, but silver thread doesn’t make the fabric itself any higher quality.</p>

<p>I’m still trying to find a way to honor our baby, as my therapist said that can help with the grief. I have all their positive tests, and I’m thinking of writing them a letter and putting it in a memory box.</p>

<p>I still have an innate desire to become a mother, but I’m not sure where DH or I are in terms of trying. It’s not something we’ve talked about much, yet.  Him feeling like he almost lost me was a lot for him to deal with, and he hasn’t directly said it, but I don’t think he wants to put my life at risk again even if that means we don’t have kids. 
I still have reserves too. My inclinations that our journey will be a hard one has only gotten stronger. The doctors told me the chances of this happening again are slim, but the chances were slim to start with and I’m still part of that small statistic. Plus there hasn’t been a lot of studies on ovarian pregnancies, so there’s not a whole lot of info I can gather on the subject. I’m terrified this will happen again.

I'm not sure what I am trying to accomplish with this post. I just want to get it off my chest with someone other than my husband. I read the rules and I hope I am complying with them. 

I had a mmc. Baby stopped growing around six weeks, found out at nine weeks and took misoprostol at the beginning of May at eleven weeks. I bled for less than two weeks, but feel that I sufficiently passed everything. My midwife mentioned waiting a cycle to get pregnant again, and in my brain that meant: get my period, don't have sex for that cycle and then after I get another period I could try. I am now learning that isn't the case and I just needed to wait for the first period after the miscarriage. I didn't realize that you could ovulate before your period returned or that you could ovulate with hcg still in your system. 

I reordered a box of pregmates HCG and lh tests to track for lighter HCG lines and eventually lh later on.

Basically over the last few days I've learned that you can still ovulate with hcg in your system and that you can get pregnant without having the return of a period. I feel silly for not knowing. 

TLDR: The whole purpose of this is that I had sex thinking we were ""safe"" on fertile days. I know my midwife said to wait, and obviously I am worried about that it's too soon and it could mess something up with a potential embryo (like maybe my uterine lining won't be great or something), but a big part of me hopes that I'll find out I'm pregnant again. 

Is it silly to wish this? I'm still very sad about our first loss, and in no way will this replace the one we lost, but I still want to have a baby when this is all said and done.

I have an average of 24/25 day cycles with last cycles being 23. I’ve been taking supplements as well. Confirmed ovulation with clear blue digital with peak fertility being on Cycle day 14 (Which I thought was rather late for my short cycles) I was also temping but my charts were dramatically up and down. Got my first faint BFP on May 20th, I took about 10 tests all very very faint but I got a yes+ on a FRER digital Friday. Saturday I got a “not pregnant” on a clear blue Saturday night.

Sunday (yesterday) I started spotting. My SO mother said it was normal and nothing to be of concern. Concerned I woke up bleeding when I was 7 weeks with my son, I tried to reassure myself. I have anxiety so I went to the ER and my levels were 5. I was sent home with the diagnoses of a threatened miscarriage and to come back in a week to have my levels rechecked. I was exhausted and literally slept all day yesterday, told my SO maybe that was a good thing because that’s the first time since my BFP that I was THAT exhausted.

<p>Sunday (yesterday) I started spotting. My SO mother said it was normal and nothing to be of concern. Concerned I woke up bleeding when I was 7 weeks with my son, I tried to reassure myself. I have anxiety so I went to the ER and my levels were 5. I was sent home with the diagnoses of a threatened miscarriage and to come back in a week to have my levels rechecked. I was exhausted and literally slept all day yesterday, told my SO maybe that was a good thing because that’s the first time since my BFP that I was THAT exhausted. </p>

I'm new-ish here. I've had 2 miscarriages since we starting TTC in April 2019. Low progesterone was likely the cause of both miscarriages, and I'm ""estrogen-dominant"".

I'm not even pregnant yet, but I'm having anxiety about if I get the positive on a Friday and have to wait until a Monday, that I might miscarry again. It's also hard to get time off of work right now for a last minute appointment.   

Does anyone else have experience with progesterone supplements? I feel stuck in a loop where the doctors say I need to keep trying, or basically to have a 3rd MC before they'll take it seriously.

I’m new to the group. I have one LC and had an early miscarriage at 6 weeks in April. My husband and I are currently TTC.

I have really sad days where I mourn what could have/should have been but I’m also starting to have longer stretches of feeling “normal”. 

It was on one of the “normal” days this week that I was listening to Brene Brown’s podcast and found myself bawling through the episode titled “David Kessler and Brene on Grief and Finding Meaning” (avail on Spotify and probably elsewhere). I was a little scared to listen especially since I’m starting to feel a little more myself, but I’m so glad I took the time and space to hear. 

The guest was insightful and honest and made me feel really comforted. His experience as a grief researcher and as a bereaved father was such a helpful perspective to have in my miscarriage experience. I wrote out a few takeaways that have been helping me to process and move forward. 

-The worst loss is always yours. Don’t compare grief.

-The meaning is not in the death. The meaning is in you and what you do with the death.

I just need to get this off my chest.  I’m going through my second miscarriage currently and it sucks.  On top of every other thing I’ve been through this year including the loss of my grandmother, the only woman who understood my fertility journey, I’m now losing another baby I’ve tried and hoped for for so long.  

I’ve had two failed times intercourse cycles, two failed IUI’s, and four failed IVF rounds.  When I started my fertility journey five years ago I had no idea this would be what was happening.  Infertility is a bastard and there’s no way around the pain of failure or loss.  

But what hurts the most for me isn’t the loss, it’s the placating gestures from the people around me.  Even ones who have experienced loss make the all to common statements like “everything happens for a reason” or my favorite “It’s all part of God’s plan” (without even taking into account I don’t believe in God might I add).  

And while I know they mean well that doesn’t change the fact that these “kind words” aren’t actually kind at all.  

These statements bother me because they aren’t meant to make ME feel better, they are said to make the ones saying it feel better.  They say it because they are uncomfortable and they don’t know what to do or how to fix this.  

When the reality is you CAN’T fix this.  You can’t fix the fact that yet another baby of mine that I have hoped and tried for for over five years is dying.  You can’t fix that come January I will be mourning my babies death rather than celebrating their birth.  You can’t fix miscarriage.  

If you want to help ANYONE experiencing loss don’t make it about you.  Don’t say something like “what’s meant to be will be”.  Get mad with them, get sad with them, mourn with them, be there for them, and above all LISTEN to them.  You’re not there to fix them.

I’m on mobile and for some reason it won’t let me type in the trigger warning I apologize.  

But I am in need of some advice.   I’m currently experiencing my second miscarriage.  I think it’s my second but who knows.  

Anyway, I’m having massive anxiety but also it’s not “anxiety”.  I’m not anxious about anything.  I’m sad, and upset but I’m not anxious.

I know that both test strips can be all sorts of confusing after a MC so I wanted to explain my situation a little more. I apologize in advance for all the little details post d&c and hope I’m not confusing anyone. 

On 5/8/2020 I had a d&c for mmc at 10 weeks for my baby measuring 7weeks 3 days. I never had any bleeding or anything prior to the d&c. Post d&c I had very very light spotting on CD1, 2,and 3 and then no bleeding until CD7. On CD7 and CD8 I had bad cramping and bleeding all of a sudden (like a medium/heavy period flow with a small clot) and every time I wiped it looked like small little particles (reminded me of like the little pieces that come off of an eraser after using it). I also noticed these little particles floating around in the toilet. Blood was dark red and then turned dark brown. On CD9 it completely went away. Today is CD 12 and Ive had no bleeding and very very minor cramping.

I’ve been doing Lh, hcg, and bbt tracking since my d&c procedure.

-this morning my Lh test looked the darkest it’s looked since I started testing (two very dark lines.) Could this mean I ovulated?

Hi all! It’s been a long time since I’ve posted but this question is making me nuts, so here I am. My sincere apologies if I make any forum missteps, as I mentioned I’m out of practice. 

Long story long, I have lean PCOS and took myo-inositol supplements much of my first year TTC. At first they seemed to help me ovulate more regularly, and then I just kept at it even though I’m not sure it was helping all that much. I conceived my 2nd round of letrozole (femera) 5mg and kept taking the myo-inositol until 8 weeks, when my midwife advised I stop (although she didn’t know much about the supplement). I learned I’d had a MMC at my 12 week appointment, but development stopped soon after that 8 week appointment (at which point everything seemed normal).

I didn’t resume the myo-inositol when I started TTC again because my RE didn’t know much about it or advise it, and because although I try to fully believe nothing I did caused the MMC, there’s a correlation in my mind because of the timing of stopping the supplement. 

However, I’ve been taking letrozole - first 5mg, then 7mg - for several cycles now and although I O, no BFPs. I can’t help thinking maybe the myo-inositol was the secret sauce that made it work before, by helping to balance blood sugar/hormones/I don’t know. At close to 2 years TTC, I’m getting a little desperate. My fear is if I restart the inositol and actually conceive again, I’ll have to discontinue it again and be afraid that will “cause” another loss. 

If there’s anyone out there who made it through this post, do you have any thoughts for me at all?

3 days after I made this post I saw the tiniest bit of pink on my panty liner in the middle of the day.  I had not exercised or done any of the usual triggers.  This turned into a few drops of dark brown blood, and by that evening I had visible pinky red blood on the TP and enough to colour the toilet water slightly.  This continued to escalate over the next 24h into my usual heavy bleeding.  I have not found this period horrendous or especially awful, although I know some people do report the first one can be bad.    

It was 37 days from my op to get my period back.  I know it absolutely sucks, but try and stay calm.  I found that I would actually get little resurgences of bleeding whenever I did something to help lower my anxiety about the situation, so although it's hard advice, if you can relax and focus on something else that reduces your stress, I think that helps encourage it along.

&#x200B;

Triggers as detailed in title.

Brief background - had surgery for a 9w-ish MMC back in mid-April.  According to a san in early May, everything seemed to be back to normal internally, and apparently I was close to ovulation.  Husband and I started DTD again.  Was hoping for my period to show up last week (around 4w post-op) although knew it could be longer.

Had been testing on and off with HPTs which seemed to have gotten to negative, but last Wednesday I got a shadow.  I had some tiny (as in a few drops on a pantyliner) instances of bleeding on Friday and Sunday which on both occasions I hoped were heralding my period starting, but nothing.

Tested again on Monday (different type of test, but same manufacturer and 10mIU sensitivity) and there were now definitely two lines, but much fainter than I would've expected.  I've tested again today with the tests I got the shadow on, and now there's nothing.  I'm not surprised as I've had zero symptoms and things just felt wrong re. the faintness of the lines yesterday.

I'm guessing this was either a very early CP or some really weird residual HCG and am just now crossing my fingers that I can expect my period soon.

Okay. I mentioned this in the daily post, but I wanted to get some advice. I had a MMC at 10 weeks (she measured 8 weeks 4 days) in January. After taking miso at home and passing her, I had to take another round and finally have a D&C to have all POC removed. My SIL got pregnant in August, I think, and was around 6 months when I lost mine. I tried to be supportive before i had success, during, and after, but this loss hit me a lot harder than my 3 previous, I’m assuming because I was further along. I also found out that I have a probable clotting disorder and suspected low progesterone, both of which need to be addressed if i have another success. 

SIL went on a cruise, with a low-lying placenta, and not surprisingly had a bleeding episode on the cruise. She spent a week in a hospital near the port they went to where they weren’t sure, for a few hours, that they would both make it. Somehow everything healed perfectly and she was able to have a normal delivery. She was on bed rest for a month or so when she came home, which is the same time I was basically, since I was so weak from all the blood loss, I went from bed, to couch, to bed. SIL got very upset that instead of both my husband and I coming to see her when she arrived back home, only my husband went. Maybe I should have gone too but besides being weak, I didn’t think I could take her going on about how blessed she was to have kept the success. After I heard she was angry about that, I did avoid her for a while since I was also hurt. We had already planned to go to my brother’s house (who lives 4 hours away) for a few days before we found out about our loss, and we kept those plans since I really needed to get away for a while. The trip was rough, but the relaxation was worth it. While I was there, my MIL got wind that I had left, and berated me for taking a trip but not seeing SIL. We were also berated for not cooking meals for them or helping them out financially. Keep in mind that SIL did say something like sorry for your loss but her boyfriend hasn’t spoken about it to us, nor have they offered the services that we were supposed to offer them. 

Since then, I have slowly gotten more comfortable with SIL, but every time I am around her, she has to either talk about her success or visually make it well known. It makes me really uncomfortable and I would take leave when it became unbearable. In person, in text and on the phone, she has seemed perfectly fine, but apparently over the months she has gotten angrier and angrier at me for not supporting her. I don’t see how; I went to her shower, I made her two blankets, even handmade other items she’ll need. I asked how everything was when I knew I could emotionally handle it, and in retrospect, I was distant at times because of this. 

It all came to a head when she was induced. My husband went to her house to wish her luck from both of us because, when he decided to go do it, I was in the middle of cooking dinner and they were going to bed soon, so i stayed home. I didn’t say much in our group chat the next day (we’ve had a group chat with MIL, SIL, me and my husband for years now) because I was having a surprisingly hard time dealing with her labor; I didn’t expect it to, but it really blindsided me and i was an emotional wreck. I realized around 3 pm that there hadn’t been any updates and, when i woke up to still no updates, I asked my MIL what was going on. In so many words, she explained that SIL was angry that I didn’t congratulate her and that she had moved the updates to another group chat, cutting me out of it. She then implied that I wasn’t family to her, and that in order to repair the relationship, i would basically have to lick some boots. 

That was two weeks ago. My husband has managed to get SIL to say that there is no excuse for how I acted, and that even her ex husband and his wife brought her gifts when she brought our nephew home and that they wrote both her and her boyfriend heartfelt messages before and after. I feel like this isn’t very fair, since no one else has experienced a loss like this, and MIL actually told me a few months ago that she “gave me the first week” after my loss to pull myself together, but after that, I should have been able to suck it up and be there for SIL. 

My question is this: how on earth can i explain how awful this is in a way they will understand? I have tried asking them to put themselves in my shoes-what if they had the loss instead? I have tried explaining that there were days I didn’t want to eat, or even get up to pee, let alone have a conversation with anyone. The reply, each time, is that there is no excuse for my actions and that I need to apologize for everything.

I don't know why you left us so quickly. I only got to know you for a couple months. We tried really hard to be ready, but I guess you needed to take your time. You peeked back in for a couple of days again, but maybe you were still too shy.

I want you to know we're so ready for you. We're trying so hard and learning so much everyday about ourselves and how to be the best for when you feel ready to join us for good. And I know it will be you, little one, you're my first baby. I know in my heart it will be you and only you.

I will continue to take my pre conception vitamins, but what else should I be discussing with my doctor?

A few weeks after the surgery (and after my follow up appointment with my doctor) I logged into the patient portal and saw that in the pre surgical testing my glucose was 107 which sent me down the pre diabetes rabbit hole. My dr explained that it would be pre diabetes if that was a fasting test and I said that I’d eaten breakfast and lunch that day so she said to disregard it. I should also mention that I drank 3 Cosmos the night before the test. I figured I’d lost the baby so I might as well have a few drinks.

Anyway, I haven’t gotten my period back since the surgery so my doctor sent me for bloods. I went a few days ago and was told they did draws for hormones, metabolic, glucose/a1c. I panicked because I started remembering the glucose level from the pre-surgical test.

All day yesterday I was in a state waiting for the phone call. I finally couldn’t take it anymore and called the office. Needless to say, they didn’t have the results in but the nurse got on the phone with me and tried to calm me down. I was so amped up that I was feeling dizzy and couldn’t breathe. We had to do breathing exercises.

I guess I’m just fixating on the a1c test. I know it’s a routine blood test (everyone I know seems to know what their a1c level is) but I’m absolutely losing my mind that I’m going to get the results and I’m going to be either diabetic or prediabetic or that there is something wrong with my kidneys or whatever. 

Not only am I obsessed with the OPKs and BBT but I’ve become obsessed with trying to see if there’s anything wrong with my pee when I’m doing the OPK test strips. It is ridiculous.

I have been so depressed about the miscarriage, too. I’m trying to go for walks by myself every night just to get out of the house. I feel better when I do that but once I’m home the anxiety sets in again.

I’m mad at myself because i feel that if I never emailed my doctor about the glucose she never would have ordered the blood tests. Maybe she would have just ordered the hormone panel since my period hasn’t returned.

My husband and I met with an RE on Thursday and I was feeling really hopeful! Because of our history of a TMFR at 14 weeks and then 2 MC following, she thinks it could *possibly* be scar tissue in my uterus from the termination since we've seen that I can make it to 14 weeks with the first pregnancy. However, the MCs could just be bad luck. She said most people start with blood work and SA before moving to Sonohysterogram and/or Hysteroscopy.

I was thinking uterine scar tissue makes the most sense and I'm currently CD 5, so I scheduled a Sonohysterogram for Tuesday. 

I heard back today that its going to be **$800** out of pocket...

Needless to say, I am not excited about that number.

My biggest concern is if we *don't* do the procedure and I get pregnant again and I lose a pregnancy AGAIN, I'll be kicking myself over not getting the procedure now and we could have possibly had a healthy pregnancy.

The risk if I get the procedure now is if they find nothing then we just shelled out $800 when it has probably just been bad luck.

I realize this is just the *beginning* of the costs of infertility. I'm hoping for some advice from all of you experienced ladies (or partners if you're out there). From what you know, would you start with the Sonohysterogram? Start with the blood work and move to Sonohysterogram if blood work is negative? Try for another pregnancy and do the Sonohysterogram if I get a 3rd MC?

Should I start with letrozole?**

Before my third pregnancy I was considering a different doctor because the RE who did my fertility and RPL work-ups (results all normal, minus known PCOS) said she strongly recommended IVF w/ PGS testing and if I wasn't ready for that we could do IUI. It caught me off-guard because I have PCOS and I haven't tried letrozole or ovulation induction meds to strengthen ovulation. We also do not have MFI so doing IUI is really no better than timed intercourse w/ meds for us (based on fertiliyIQ stats), it's just more expensive. During my HSG she also stated I have an arcuate uterus, and this could be an issue but most doctors consider it a natural variation. She stated that I might want to consider having it removed if I had another loss.

Then I got pregnant in March (after ovulating on CD68) and my RE's response was ""Due to COVID and because this is a spontaneous pregnancy, we recommend you seek care with your normal OBGYN."" They just dropped me as a patient completely. No progesterone testing (known issue w/ PCOS), no betas, no well wishes, nothing. I'm still angry about this, obviously. I proceed to lose pregnancy (MMC diagnosed at first ultrasound at 8+4).

Yesterday I called the RE to ask what they recommend for next steps. The RE said after my OBGYN has cleared me w/ a negative HCG blood test, they would like to do a hysteroscopy for arcuate uterus and I should make an appointment at that time. 

I'm having a little heartache over this and I don't know if I'm actually being logical or if it's because I'm emotional and desperate to have a child. I figure I have two options to pursue, both potentially resulting in wasted time. 

* Option 1: Pursue a second opinion and ask for medicated cycles w/ letrozole + all the things (progesterone, baby aspirin, etc). This makes sense because science says PCOS results in weak ovulation, which is associated with MC. The risk is another MC and several months of time and pursuing hysteroscopy anyways. 
* Option 2: Skip letrozole and have hysteroscopy now. Sit out 1 cycle prior to procedure + 2 cycles after procedure for healing then continue TTC. The evidence on arcuate uteruses being an issue is controversial, and that makes me nervous. The risk here is MC because there is a different cause that was not corrected.

In my mind, it makes sense to pursue the least invasive option first, right?

<p>Any of you have any experience in weird periods AFTER weaning? Spotting like a week before your period? I am kind of at a loss. I seed cycle, take 50mg OF b6 after ovulation, 1000mg of vitamin c, and nothing seems to make it better. </p>

<p>Any advice would be welcome. I so wanted to be relaxed this time...</p>

They suspect it’s an ectopic pregnancy this time because there was no pregnancy matter on my abdominal or internal scan but I’m still in extreme pain and experiencing pregnancy symptoms and haven’t passed as much matter as I did with MC1.

I’m not as devastated as I thought. I don’t know whether I’m numb or if I was unconsciously preparing myself for this over the last 8 weeks. 

I’m thankful for the lockdown, because we didn’t tell anyone outside our immediate family. 
I’m also grateful that this MC was relatively short, with MC1 I was spotting from week 6 and didn’t confirm the miscarriage until I was almost 11 weeks. 
I started spotting Monday morning, cramps escalated from mild period pains to excruciating cramping and passing clots within 24 hours. 

Scan this morning confirmed that my uterus is empty. 


Even typing that sentence feels a bit surreal. 
It’s like I want to feel something, but I also don’t want to feel anything. 

I don’t know if I’ll TTC again, I can’t numb myself out like this or funnel my energy into OPK’s, early pregnancy test strips, BMR Temperatures anymore. If it’s ectopic, will it ruin my chances of conceiving again?

When I got pregnant in November, I didn’t know. In hindsight I conceived on our honeymoon. I use to ovulate and have my periods like clock work. I never had to think. I knew my symptoms of both. Anyway as time went on in November being blissfully unaware I was pregnant, I went camping with friends, drinking the night before thanksgiving. In December I had my annual Christmas party at the house hosted by basically fireball. 
The next week I was due for my period and I just knew. I didn’t test until it was passed and I just knew. That was December 21. I was so unaware I had been pregnant since November 2nd. I will never know that feeling again.

How genetically bad are those eggs now that I’m 36? How will I ever have 2 children?
I just can’t believe I’ll never know my body like I did before. I can’t tell you now what ovulation feels like or what a period feels like, it’s all off and that makes me so very angry. 
I am angry because my loss was in March and I’m 36 and childless, my ob doesn’t want to order testing because I only had one full cycle but I want my baseline. I want to know my ovarian reserve. I want to make sure things are right with me and my husband and that pregnancy wasn’t just a “fluke” since my loss has no explanation except a “fluke”

Since being unemployed at the moment and having elevated anxiety levels, I’ve been hyper aware of every sensation in my body. So I noticed my breasts were sore (which never happens until my period is due, I’m on the pill).  I started having intense mood swings and nausea. I started getting positive tests about 6 days before my missed period- but they were all very light and did not get darker. On the day I would be expecting my period, I noticed that I wasn’t feeling the symptoms as much but noticed I was having period like cramps. Test showed yet another faint positive. I started bleeding heavily that evening and it lasted for about 2 days. Did all the research and realized it was a chemical pregnancy. 

This is now just over 2 weeks ago. In normal life I would go to a doctor. But considering I’m now unemployed and without insurance, I figured I’d be fine and to just take it easy at home.

I guess my question is this: is it normal to still be experiencing symptoms? The most obvious one to me is full, sore breasts. I also just feel very bloated and puffy. I’ve definitely been emotional as well, but that’s to be expected after the excitement/terror of becoming a first time mother, during a pandemic no less. But I was not expecting to still feel like this considering it was such an early loss.
