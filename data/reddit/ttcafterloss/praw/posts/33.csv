0,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I thought I would be 12 weeks this past Sunday, but instead I started bleeding on Friday. I made it in to the doctors and they confirmed the baby had stopped growing at around 9 weeks. I had already passed a large clot by the time I made it in there, so I knew. It mostly happened that evening. I had had a scan at 8 weeks and thought I was in the clear. I know that 20% of pregnancies end in loss but at that late time it's a tiny number. This would have been my first, and I'm 32. I have had a miscarriage before, but when I was much younger and it was due to a teratrogenic medication I was taking, so it doesn't really count in terms of the emotional loss or worry that it will happen again. I'm trying to stay optimistic there.

All I can think of is when we can start to TTC again. I can't concentrate on anything except reading about this and cleaning the house. I cry multiple times a day. I wait until my husband gets home. I've been bleeding only lightly since Monday and while I've had a scan to confirm I didn't need a d&c, I am worried that whatever is left will take forever and I'll be bleeding for weeks. All I can think is that the sooner I stop bleeding, the sooner we can try. I'm going to start trying pretty immediately - screw waiting - but the weeks of waiting for this to be over, waiting to test, and then if its positive waiting to get past an (unknown) point at which I will feel safer - that looks like the next six months of purgatory.

My doctor is really nice and is going to run an RPL panel on me because I have an immune disorder that is correlated with antiphospholipid syndrome. It sounds like from some things I've read here that my HCG has to be less than 5 again? I have an appointment next Wednesday and the last thing I want is to wait until after the holidays. The worst part is that I took a fish oil pill that had phosphatidylcholine in it - I just wasn't thinking - and had zero idea that like 50% of people with my diagnosis have this disorder. I wonder if I caused it that way.

Tomorrow I have to call my MIL back. I don't want to hear about how she had a miscarriage when she had had two living children first, and got to start having kids much younger, etc. I hate these calls that are basically happening because the person feels like this is what a nice person does that don't do anything but add to my emotional burden. I've talked to one friend each day. They are easier because they understand me more, but it still takes so much. I cry before the call, and after.

We were planning to share the good news with most family at Christmas, and now it's just going to be incredibly depressing.

Edit: So I've been up all night and thought to re-look at my recent thyroid panels, just knowing the controversy over what constitutes hypothyroidism, etc. My TSH was over 3 at 8 weeks. The reference range goes up to 5, of course, but my understanding is that pregnant patients in first tri shouldn't be over 2.5. Heck, a great deal of endos think you shouldn't be over 3 if you're a regular person. I noticed that my labs over the last 4 years have shown a steady uptick on this measure, but this is the first time it has been notably problematic. But of course a non-specialist doctor wouldn't flag this. I can't even express the level of frustration I have with the medical system not noticing these things, relying on reference ranges without understanding how reference ranges even come into being, and waiting until things become a huge problem to treat. It's not my first time with that kind of thing - when I finally went to the doctor for my crushing fatigue, 5 or 6 years back, I asked to be tested for b12. The doctor said that test was woo and while he'd give it to me, he'd also just give me adderall. When I tested I was 1 point above the bottom of the reference range (which is different in other countries - where I would have been hundreds of points below the bottom). I have been going from doctor to doctor since then, all of whom have their one lab finding they care about. In some ways it would be good to have an answer, but now I absolutely have to wait to try until I can get an appointment with a decent endocrinologist.",t2_13811x,False,,0,False,These Days feel so long (intro),[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_5hctbb,False,dark,0.88,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,6,,False,self,1481279870.0,,[],{},,True,,1481302863.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I thought I would be 12 weeks this past Sunday, but instead I started bleeding on Friday.

We've gone through genetic testing and feel ready (or as ready as we can be) to start trying again.  I was on the pill prior to Nora for years. Going off of it, I had a light period but it was regular.

Did I mess up my cycle that much from my irregular use of the pill (roughly June-August)? My plan is to make an appointment in January for bloodwork once I figure out who I'm supposed to go see, MFM, regular ob-gym?

MFM said I wasn't high risk, midwives gave me *one* extra ultrasound and told me we'd treat the pregnancy like it was normal. I felt like I was too anxious to advocate harder for myself, though I tried and saw 3 different specialists, including driving 3 hours roundtrip to 2 of them.

And then the pregnancy ended with the baby dying AGAIN at 20 weeks. I asked the midwife at my postpartum followup yesterday what they would do differently if I ever got pregnant again. 

She looked at me, shook her head, shrugged and said, ""Nothing, really. I'm afraid you've stumped us."" 

WHAT. No. Not good enough. You want me to just lose a THIRD BABY? Tell me to find a different practice! Tell me you'll send me to a specialist! TRY HARDER.

It was crushing and does NOT help my anxiety (I am currently unsure if we'll pursue another pregnancy, but having a plan in case we do is part of managing my anxiety).

In my dream world of post-loss pregnancy, I'd have a doctor/midwife who scans me every 2 weeks and doesn't want my anxiety to be debilitating. Not to mention, being willing to find answers and/or try different prescriptions (Lovenox, maybe even Prednisone) in an effort to NOT have another heart-crushing stillbirth.

How do I find this? Do I call around and ask receptionists if the doctors would be willing to give me lots of ultrasounds...? I am clearly not getting the medical care I need from these people.

28,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello,
I'm exactly 7w4d today. We saw a baby with a heart rate of 132 on Wednesday. My RE (I've had 2 other miscarriages this year) said to stop taking progesterone on the 2nd (2 days ago). I took my last dose at about 2pm and then went to work at 7pm. In the morning, I had some light brown spotting, but attributed it to some leftover progesterone.

This afternoon, I woke up and had some dark brown spotting with some dark brown clots, about the size of a pencil eraser. I put in a progesterone again, just in case, and then afterwards noticed an even larger clot that was brown and slightly red, although it was hard to tell if it was blood red, or progesterone red (the pills themselves are rust-colored). Now I'm having small amounts of clots with dark spotting every time I wipe.

Everything I read basically says it's a pretty ominous sign. I can't believe this is happening for the third time. If I miscarry again I'm honestly not really sure how I'll go on anymore. 

I'm a NICU nurse and I work with about 200 other ladies and everyone's always pregnant. It hurts to see literally everyone else my age on their second baby, and my body can't even keep one in there.

I'll call the RE tomorrow, but I know what the outcome is going to be. This is how it started the first time.

Edit: The doctor had me come in for another ultrasound. Baby looked ok, and they couldn't find a source of the bleeding :/ they restarted me on the progesterone, but I've still had some intermittent spotting and clots.

I've also been having some cramping on and off (but admittedly I'm also so constipated and can't tell if that's contributing, haha.) I'm going back for another ultrasound on Tuesday morning, just to be safe.

It was happy to see the baby, but I still have such a bad feeling about everything.

I'm glad my update earned me downvotes... wth

I&#39;m exactly 7w4d today. We saw a baby with a heart rate of 132 on Wednesday. My RE (I&#39;ve had 2 other miscarriages this year) said to stop taking progesterone on the 2nd (2 days ago). I took my last dose at about 2pm and then went to work at 7pm. In the morning, I had some light brown spotting, but attributed it to some leftover progesterone.</p>

<p>This afternoon, I woke up and had some dark brown spotting with some dark brown clots, about the size of a pencil eraser. I put in a progesterone again, just in case, and then afterwards noticed an even larger clot that was brown and slightly red, although it was hard to tell if it was blood red, or progesterone red (the pills themselves are rust-colored). Now I&#39;m having small amounts of clots with dark spotting every time I wipe.</p>

<p>Everything I read basically says it&#39;s a pretty ominous sign. I can&#39;t believe this is happening for the third time. If I miscarry again I&#39;m honestly not really sure how I&#39;ll go on anymore. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a NICU nurse and I work with about 200 other ladies and everyone&#39;s always pregnant. It hurts to see literally everyone else my age on their second baby, and my body can&#39;t even keep one in there.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll call the RE tomorrow, but I know what the outcome is going to be. This is how it started the first time.</p>

We got lucky and got pregnant fairly quickly in August, but miscarried 3 weeks ago today at 15w due to acute chronioamnionitis (infection in the amniotic fluid/placenta). They believe I had a UTI that got into the placenta somehow and caused me to go into preterm labour. I had cramps for 2 days but no bleeding so didn't worry at all. By Sunday night the cramps had got worse, and at 2am I went to wipe and saw blood. My husband took me to the ER and my water broke when I got out of the car. I gave birth to our little girl at 2:30am in the bathroom when I went to do a urine sample - I hadn't even been admitted to the hospital yet. It was the most traumatic night of my life 🙁 and my husband has been my absolute rock. 4 days later I got a wickid kidney infection, so it seems I don't show symptoms of these things until it gets really bad, which worries me for subsequent pregnancies. 

We are both ready to try again after I get my period but are in a bit of a dilemma. My family doctor (who was a bit useless after this all happened) has said it's fine to start trying again right away, which we feel emotionally ready to do after my first period. I also met with an OB thanks to a connection of a very close friend, and they have said they will follow my next pregnancy from the beginning and they were the ones to order all of my follow up blood work, ultrasound, etc. However, they recommended waiting 3 cycles to try again in our case (they normally recommend 1). I believe this is to make sure all possibilities of an infection are gone, but my follow up blood work and ultrasound both were clear and showed no signs of infection. 

Now I'm not sure what to do. We aren't young (31 and almost 36) and this will be our first, so we are both feeling the pressure of time. Who knows how long it could take to conceive the next time, too? But I don't want to go against the orders of the OB and start off my next pregnancy on the wrong foot if I were to conceive quickly. I just worry about wasting two good months if I feel ready to try emotionally and physically. 

Any suggestions or advice? How long did you wait again to try after your MC?

I feel pretty alone... I just need to talk it out.

So I track and temp, this is cycle 2 for me and my husband. I'm 33. Healthy, average woman. I was in BCP for the last 15 years. 

A little info on my first and recent CP. I'm including the details because all the CP posts I've seen are usually getting a positive hpt that lightens and then the bleeding begins- or a temp drop then bleeding. Mine is without a temp drop until after the bleeding and my hpt was strongest on the day of loss.

On 10DPO hpt was neg. 

On 13 didn't feel like AF was coming - and I was now late- and I felt weird. I grabbed some Walmart tests which were positive. I didn't get excited. It was very faint.
14DPO same thing, darker?? I took like 3, plus a FRER- faint line!!
15DPO. Definitely a line on FRER and yes on a digital! I'm 3 days late on this day. Temps are high!  Told my husband!
4 hours later I'm bleeding. 

I had cramps since O. They were worse that day though. Like a 5/10.
I only bled lightly that day and a bit more of a medium flow (by my standards) the next. Now I'm spotting. I'm not sure if I could've filled a tampon with the blood. I only wore panty liners.
 My temp dropped what would've been 16DPO.

And I'm thinking I'm done bleeding now... with only 2 days of light bleeding and one day of brown spotting. Is this normal? I expected more blood.

My period is always light. This was just like my period except slightly more mucous and more red blood.

I'm worried that maybe my uterine lining is too thin. Maybe that's why I lost the pregnancy?

Anyone else have very light (I can't even fill a light tampon in 8 hours) period?

I just have a lot of questions. I'm sad. I am angry. I'm upset that I have no answers. My doctor didn't want to see me. The OBGYN wasn't interested in seeing me unless I was dying basically. 

I've read around that you're very fertile after a CP, although I haven't seen any evidence to back it up. Anyone know if that is true?
However then there's that little pessimist in me that's saying ""you probably have something wrong with your endometrium anyway so don't get excited""... 
ugh. I don't know how to deal.

Any advice is appreciated!! I'm clearly losing my mind.

Just have a few questions about what happens post D and C would be great to hear some of your experiences. 

Background: So I found out I had a miscarriage last week. I was 8 weeks at the time and was told the gestational sac was about 6 and a half weeks. As I wasn't bleeding or showing any signs that I would pass this naturally my obstetrician scheduled me in for a D and C which I has yesterday. 

Post D and C I have had light bleeding (only pink blood) and I was hoping anyone who has had a D and C could let me know what kind of bleeding you had and how long it lasted? 

Also how long did it take to get your first period after the D and C and lastly how long did it take to fall pregnant again? 

These past two weeks have been devastating and I am really looking forward to my body regulating itself again so that we can start trying again- my doctor recommended I wait until I get my period before I start trying again. Any help with this will be greatly appreciated.

After my first mc in July, I bought a ring (https://www.etsy.com/listing/256901793/sale-20-off-dual-birthstone-ring-in?ref=shop_home_active_8) from etsy with two February birthstones (my EDD). Between ordering it and receiving it, I had second thoughts and tried to get the stones switched but it had already been finished at that point, so I kept it. Since receiving it, I have worn it probably less than a dozen times. It's a little physically uncomfortable (I'm not used to a ring on that finger), and sometimes emotionally uncomfortable when I don't really want to be reminded. 

[TW: language] I briefly considered ordering another one after this second loss and I even looked up May's birthstone...but then thought, ""I don't want to end up with a finger covered in rings dedicated to dead babies."" And then I thought what about if I get to keep a baby one day? Will I have all these rings for losses and yet nothing to honor live babies?

So I spilled this all to her and she offered the suggestion of getting some candles and lighting them when I felt like it. I expressed some fear/hesitation at the fact that if they were specific candles for this, maybe I'm just sitting on the couch and I don't really want to think about it that day and I see them and get upset by them, etc. She suggested tea lights, since those are small and pretty much one-use...but that doesn't feel special enough to me. (Also do I get 3? 2? 1?) Maybe a nice holder that I can put away somewhere? I am non-religious, but I wouldn't be opposed to a ritual of some sort. Bringing out a specific thing, doing something, storing it away until next time. 

All of this word vomit to ask is there a way you honor your losses? I welcome all answers but really interested in something you can do on certain days, but not be smacked in the face with it on other days, when you're not feeling up to it? 

My losses were early, I know that the first loss was twin girls, thanks to the D&C but there was no embryo/it happened at home the second time. I have not given names to the losses, I'm not sure if that would help me.

We just finished IVF and got the pgs results the day before. Lucky for us, 2 good embryos. I've had 4 MCs in 12 months. It's been a horrible year.

I very specifically did not want extended family knowing about our situation however my mom is a nurse and so she and my dad know. My dad already screwed up once by telling my older (now estranged, alcoholic) sister about one of my miscarriages.

I was totally blindsided when at the end of the evening my uncle comes up to me as I'm going over genealogy docs with my aunt and says ""cookmybook, I hear you are having a hard time and have had some bad luck and I really hope it works out for you."" I say thanks and my aunt doesn't even flinch, which says to me she knows too. I am humiliated. I had no idea these people know anything about our situation, and it was my information to share. I went through the whole evening thinking my secret was safe when it wasn't. Now all of my cousins will end up knowing and I'm pissed. 

I have no clue EXACTLY what he knows, if any details or what and I'm appalled that either my mom or dad shared anything with them. 

It's official, we are going to speed up our original plan and try for the transfer in Jan.

My husband and I began trying for #2 in July. Our first is the product of IVF. We had 3 remaining embryos. The first two didn't take, but when the third did, I started cramping and bleeding the day after my second beta. I called the clinic and they told me it was normal, but to come in for another beta just to put my mind at ease. Unfortunately when they called with my results, they told me that my numbers were going down, and I was to stop all meds so I could miscarry naturally. If it's so early, does this make it a chemical pregnancy?

I had everything riding on this. We are out of embryos. It is very unlikely we will ever conceive on our own. In our lifetime of TTC we have spent $23,000, not even counting all the over the counter extras I've bought. Now, if we want to have another, we will have to start with at least $16,000 more. 

I feel like I'm in denial. I'm bitter. I'm angry. I'm numb. I'm just waiting for the process to start, as I haven't passed anything yet.

I've been lurking the past couple of weeks, but now I feel it is the right time to say hello.  Sorry in advance that this is so long. I didn't realize how much I needed to just write this all down. 

I am 29F living in Toronto with my DH and our 16-month-old son. We decided early in the Fall to try for a second and were blessed to succeed relatively quickly. I spent October feeling pretty bad, and experienced some prolonged bleeding which sent me in for 2 early ultrasounds that showed a heartbeat around 8 weeks. I felt crappy but confident. 

In the first week of November, we went for our NT scan at around 11.5 weeks. The tech was not chatty and asked us if it was possible our dates were wrong (yes, it was) but gave me no reason to worry. The next day I had my first scheduled OB appointment and my whole world crashed down. My Dr explained to me that the NT scan had found a very abnormal measurement of the fluid behind the baby's neck - more than twice what would be normal. This could be indicative of a serious chromosomal disorder. She had already booked us in to come back to the hospital the next day to meet with a high-risk fetal specialist who would repeat the scan and help us determine next steps. My DH and I returned the next morning and the Fetal specialist confirmed it wasn't just a mistake. There was definitely something wrong. He immediately offered to do a CVS, which we agreed to. We hoped we would have results by the next tuesday, as my OB had OR time the next wednesday in the event that the results were particularly grim. Unfortunately, we did not get them on time and chose to wait on them before making any irreversible decision. When we did get the results, they weren't great. The baby had Turner syndrome, along with a host of other very serious heart and swelling issues. The doctors provided their advice that this baby was not going to make it through the pregnancy. We knew for us the right decision was to end the pregnancy quickly and not wait for the terrible to happen. It took another whole week to get time in the hospital OR with an OB I trusted. Overall, it was two weeks from the time that we learned the baby inside me was likely not going to make it until the moment that we are at now - square one, starting over. 

I have never felt so dark, and full of sadness. Even though I know that this truly was not our fault, and that it was essentially a fluke that this baby made it as far as she did, I can't help but feel guilt for what happened, and fear for what awaits us as we heal and start trying again. 

It's nice to meet you all, though I certainly wish it were under other circumstances.

Overall, it was two weeks from the time that we learned the baby inside me was likely not going to make it until the moment that we are at now - square one, starting over. </p>

<p>I have never felt so dark, and full of sadness. Even though I know that this truly was not our fault, and that it was essentially a fluke that this baby made it as far as she did, I can&#39;t help but feel guilt for what happened, and fear for what awaits us as we heal and start trying again. </p>

<p>It&#39;s nice to meet you all, though I certainly wish it were under other circumstances. </p>

Hi all - 
I just received in my online medical chart the results from my surgical hysteroscopy from Oct 24. I have no idea if these results have just been released (aka I am seeing them at the same time as my doc) or if he had access to them at my 2 week post-op appointment on Nov 8. In any case, consulting with Dr. Google has, of course, caused me to slightly freak, so I thought I'd ask you all for your two cents. 

Here were the procedures performed &amp; findings:  

**Final Pathologic Diagnosis**    

A. ENDOMETRIUM, CURETTAGE:  

* Weakly proliferative endometrial glands with stromal breakdown.
* Fragments of benign endocervical glandular and squamous mucosa.  


B. ENDOMETRIAL POLYP, BIOPSY:  

* Weakly proliferative endometrial glands with stromal breakdown.  

C. LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE, PARATUBAL CYST, EXCISION:  

* Consistent with paratubal cyst.  

What I'm wondering is - is *weakly* proliferative endometrium an issue? Everything I google just tells me its something you see in prepubertal, perimenopausal, and menopausal women - no HELP! I'm reading that weakly proliferative endometrium is normal in polyps, but I also had that finding in my normal endometrial tissue. Anyone heard of this before? Thanks in advance. I also sent my doc a message but don't know if I'll hear back given the upcoming holiday, or at all.

This cycle was my first on Clomid and I had really high hopes. I had a bunch of mature follicles, my lining was ""perfect"", I ovulated, my CD21 number was amazing, and we had tons of sex. I mean...come on! That's a reason for hope.

So, yes, it ""worked"". I conceived. I got a positive on Saturday at 9dpo...but it was such a squinter I called it a no (until it dried). Monday was 11dpo and it was there more...that was when I should have had a 1 year old and I was SO happy to see a positive on that day. It helped get me through it. 12dpo it was even darker. Progression!! This is good!!

Whelp. No. My HCG is now 8 and my progesterone is super f'ing low. And I started bleeding. My doctors are already calling it a chemical. (of course I have to go back in after the holiday to re-test to make sure its negative)

It is my THIRD chemical this year (March, September, November). My FOURTH loss this year (MMC in February at 7+3). And my 5th loss overall (MC May 2015 at 10+4)

The doctors don't want me on Clomid this cycle, to let my lining recover from a miscarriage. So I can't even try again until late December (seriously fertile on Christmas, why not have all this shit around holidays).

102,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone. Sorry for the long-winded rant and word vomit ahead. Some may know me, I thought I was 8+5 today and just had my first scan which showed an empty gestational sac, or a blighted ovum. I had a MMC with twins followed by a D&C at the end of July. I have one healthy 2.5 year old son.

I knew in my gut something wasn't right, I've never had any real symptoms of this pregnancy. I tried to explain this to the nurse last week during my intake appointment and she just blew me off, and even said, ""well, could you maybe not be pregnant? Did you just take the one test?"" I was so mad, like are you serious? I single handedly kept Wondfo in business for the first month. Fuck that. And today my whole experience was just horrible. My husband was with me, but I was just a wreck even in the waiting room beforehand. I explained to the tech about my past, as I was already shaking and crying. When she started the scan, she was just silent, and never said anything. I had to deduct on my own that her silence meant something was wrong, and I just started crying and shaking and saying ""there's nothing there"" even though I couldn't see the screen. My husband could, and figured out it wasn't good. The tech still never said anything. She just kept clicking around and doing whatever while I cried and sobbed and my husband tried to console me. Finally after five minutes of scanning she said ""so you've had no bleeding?"" and that was it. Never said a fucking word about what she saw, about anything. I'm still so, so angry about that. 

So after being insistent about my dates being correct and getting a positive test 13dpo, the doctor agreed that this is a blighted ovum. She thinks its just a stroke of bad luck, having two MCs back to back. I got upset about that and said I wanted testing done, that I'm 35 and I'm not going to continue down this road if something's wrong. She agreed and said that was more than fair and they'll do testing on me if it's what I want, but she said she would even go so far to put money on a bet that this was just coincidence since I have a healthy son already - so she said don't expect answers, which, of course, is all I want right now. But, as for testing, etc, that's a conversation for the future. It's hard for me to see, impossible for me to see really, that these two MMCs back to back are just ""bad luck."" 

I chose the route of misoprostol this time, as I can't reason with having a D&C when there's not even fetal tissue, and I don't want to run the risk of scarring, complications, or adhesions. I'm terrified, though. I just inserted the pills and I'm so, so scared. Does anyone have any advice, feedback, or info about what to expect? The doctor was very patient with me as I asked a lot of questions, but I can't even remember much of what she said because my mind is so numb. I have a second dose to administer in 24 hours if this one doesn't work. I have a feeling my body will fail at this too and I'll wind up needing a D&C anyway, since it can't even fucking miscarry properly. 

I'm so angry. I'm so bitter. I'm so done with life throwing shit at me. And right before Thanksgiving... and I'm supposed to feel grateful right now? Fuck that. Fuck all of this. I know how ridiculous and immature it all sounds, that I have so much in my life to be grateful for. And it's not that I don't know that, that I don't see that and appreciate it in the back of my head. But not today. Today I'm fucking angry, and sad, and heartbroken all over again. I don't get it, I don't understand it. Am I just supposed to stop? Is this life giving me a sign, two in a row, that I'm not meant to keep doing this?

Sorry for the long-winded rant and word vomit ahead. Some may know me, I thought I was 8+5 today and just had my first scan which showed an empty gestational sac, or a blighted ovum. I had a MMC with twins followed by a D&amp;C at the end of July. I have one healthy 2.5 year old son.</p>

<p>I knew in my gut something wasn&#39;t right, I&#39;ve never had any real symptoms of this pregnancy. I tried to explain this to the nurse last week during my intake appointment and she just blew me off, and even said, &quot;well, could you maybe not be pregnant? Did you just take the one test?&quot; I was so mad, like are you serious? I single handedly kept Wondfo in business for the first month. Fuck that. And today my whole experience was just horrible. My husband was with me, but I was just a wreck even in the waiting room beforehand. I explained to the tech about my past, as I was already shaking and crying. When she started the scan, she was just silent, and never said anything. I had to deduct on my own that her silence meant something was wrong, and I just started crying and shaking and saying &quot;there&#39;s nothing there&quot; even though I couldn&#39;t see the screen. My husband could, and figured out it wasn&#39;t good. The tech still never said anything. She just kept clicking around and doing whatever while I cried and sobbed and my husband tried to console me. Finally after five minutes of scanning she said &quot;so you&#39;ve had no bleeding?&quot; and that was it. Never said a fucking word about what she saw, about anything. I&#39;m still so, so angry about that. </p>

<p>So after being insistent about my dates being correct and getting a positive test 13dpo, the doctor agreed that this is a blighted ovum. She thinks its just a stroke of bad luck, having two MCs back to back. I got upset about that and said I wanted testing done, that I&#39;m 35 and I&#39;m not going to continue down this road if something&#39;s wrong. She agreed and said that was more than fair and they&#39;ll do testing on me if it&#39;s what I want, but she said she would even go so far to put money on a bet that this was just coincidence since I have a healthy son already - so she said don&#39;t expect answers, which, of course, is all I want right now. But, as for testing, etc, that&#39;s a conversation for the future. It&#39;s hard for me to see, impossible for me to see really, that these two MMCs back to back are just &quot;bad luck.&quot; </p>

<p>I chose the route of misoprostol this time, as I can&#39;t reason with having a D&amp;C when there&#39;s not even fetal tissue, and I don&#39;t want to run the risk of scarring, complications, or adhesions. I&#39;m terrified, though. I just inserted the pills and I&#39;m so, so scared. Does anyone have any advice, feedback, or info about what to expect? The doctor was very patient with me as I asked a lot of questions, but I can&#39;t even remember much of what she said because my mind is so numb. I have a second dose to administer in 24 hours if this one doesn&#39;t work. I have a feeling my body will fail at this too and I&#39;ll wind up needing a D&amp;C anyway, since it can&#39;t even fucking miscarry properly. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so angry. I&#39;m so bitter. I&#39;m so done with life throwing shit at me. And right before Thanksgiving... and I&#39;m supposed to feel grateful right now? Fuck that. Fuck all of this. I know how ridiculous and immature it all sounds, that I have so much in my life to be grateful for. And it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t know that, that I don&#39;t see that and appreciate it in the back of my head. But not today. Today I&#39;m fucking angry, and sad, and heartbroken all over again. I don&#39;t get it, I don&#39;t understand it. Am I just supposed to stop? Is this life giving me a sign, two in a row, that I&#39;m not meant to keep doing this? What&#39;s so ironic is that my son was a total accident, an unexpected oops, and I took that pregnancy for granted every single day. Then when we actually make the decision to try, I have two miscarriages. Thanks a lot, life. </p>

This means there was a septum in the middle of my uterus, which did not get much blood flow. So when my baby implanted on the septum he did not have the blood flow he needed. I had a hysteroscopic resection of the uterian septum, messing they removed the septum, and then I had lots of testing to make sure everything was fixed. Then we started trying again.

I lost my second baby in August at 7 weeks. We don't know why. They ran lots of tests. All that came back was that my AMH levels are high. Given other factors my Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE) said I most likely have PCOS, but she does not believe that caused me to miscarry.

We spent 3 hours with him (one of my regrets from Clare was not spending enough time with her) and he was so beautiful. He had a double chin and was so chubby already! Which makes it even more WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED - our last baby died at 21 weeks but had been struggling for weeks and was very tiny and scrawny. This baby (we named him Peter) looked so...healthy. 

Not knowing why I lost two babies this year is incredibly excruciating, especially since doctors have all told us it's unlikely we'll find a reason.

Leaving the hospital after giving birth without a baby for the second time in 2016 is terrible. It's all so excruciatingly terrible and unfathomable and words still can't touch what this pain feels like. Any time to have this happen again would be hard, but this is just...unbearable. Because I got pregnant before my period ever returned, I really wasn't in a good place mentally and emotionally during this pregnancy. So to have it end like this...I honestly don't know how I'll get through it. How I'll survive this without feeling isolated and alone. 

It's like I want everyone to know what's going on and no one to know because pretending I'm okay is easier than showing my pain. 

I've been pregnant for 62 weeks total, threw up dozens of times, had 2 surgeries, and gave birth twice - none of which resulted in a living baby. 

Life is fucking unfair. I'm damaged and broken but I don't want to people to know I am. 

On a more practical note - I'm incredibly let down by my doctors for not taking better care of me during this pregnancy. For telling me I'm not high risk and that ""we'll treat this like a normal pregnancy."" For not showing more concern or bending over backward to help me.

Going forward, I plan to send slides of my placenta to Yale, do a MFM consult and genetic testing for my husband and I, and be tested for protein c and s. Yale is no longer on my insurance (of COURSE. this year. Ugh) so I might have to write a letter to my insurance requesting continuity of care since I saw them just 6 weeks ago. If not, I have someone in Boston I can see. 

I just want answers, even if they can't find any, I want to try everything I can. I feel like I owe it to my babies. And to my sense of justice.

<p>Are you sure you want to be pregnant now? Your husband is leaving for 2-3 months. 
I forgot I can&#39;t be pregnant myself, i think I&#39;m an irresponsible adult. I&#39;ll make sure my husband is next to me 24/7 to make sure I can manage being pregnant (no that we&#39;re a military family and he could be gone for months and months at a time) </p>
