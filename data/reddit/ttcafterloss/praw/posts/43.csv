I was on here in 2015-16 following a miscarriage at 12 weeks, TTC and then my pregnancy with my daughter. My husband and I have just started to TTC #2. 

History: Went off BC in January 2015 had a 30 day cycle and thought I was good to go for TTC. I did not temp or do anything and actually thought I was pregnant when my period didn't show up in 30 days. With that confusion I took some OPKs and did ovulate around CD35. Took some HPTs around DPO 10-16 and all negative but no period. Freaked out some and finally on DPO18 got a positive. From the start I was anxious. Around week 5 had some betas and they were ok, but not great. I think doubling every 96 hours. Had 3 ultrasounds, 6, 8 and 9 weeks and everything looked great. Healthy baby, growing right on track. Went to my 12 week ultrasound and saw the baby had just passed away. I demanded some tests because I had a feeling something was wrong. From all the testing, we discovered that I have Hashimoto's and PCOS. 

I got pregnant with my daughter 5 long months later and had a very anxiety filled pregnacy. It was pretty textbook, but I was terrified the whole time. I saw a therapist who said I had PTSD. 

I tried to use this experience and make it positive and now I volunteer with a local infant/pregnancy loss group.

I know its a little odd to be back, but I could really use the support with TTC. My husband can only take so much. :)",t2_nkk1i,False,,0,False,Intro X2,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_6lf76w,False,dark,0.99,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,7,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1499301736.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone,</p>

natural miscarriage in 2008 when I was 21. Natural miscarriage at 5w2d in October 2016. Blighted ovum discovered in December 2016, termination at 9w since my body never got the message to miscarry naturally. Missed miscarriage discovered in June 2017 at 12 weeks (things stopped progressing at 7 weeks), termination last Tuesday. But we’ve gotten pregnant once on accident and all 3 times we’ve tried, so at least there’s that?


Long rant:
I’m sitting here recovering and feeling useless. The D&C was great compared to the misoprostol last time (it took two doses and 5 days to pass the pregnancy—never again). I wasn’t bleeding much and had hardly any pain, but today, 5 days after the procedure, my uterus got the message and things went from not as bad as a normal period to exactly like a normal period. I broke down and took some of the narcotic pain meds they gave me and now can’t do anything productive for the day.


I’ve had suspected endometriosis for 15 years, ovarian cysts for 12 years, and for the past 3 years, fibroids that haven’t stopped growing. My biggest fibroid is now about 11cm in diameter, and you can see it through my tummy. I can feel it all the time. I’m only 30, and my quality of life decreases with every period and every pregnancy.


My OBGYN is talking about me possibly having the fibroids removed before we try again. I had a sonohysterogram after my last loss, and they’re not affecting the inside of my uterus at all. She thinks they may still be playing a role and might send me to a specialist, depending on what the genetic testing looks like from my most recent loss.


It seems like the miscarriages have little in common, which is what is making me most nervous. Could it be that we just have shitty luck? (I mean, we have shitty luck in general, so I wouldn’t be too surprised if that’s the answer.) I’m nervous that the genetic testing will come back with something common that has nothing to do with our health. Or that it will be normal. I’m nervous that the specialist will say the fibroids aren’t affecting my fertility. I’m nervous that we’ll just have to keep trying because we’ll just get a ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ from the doctors.


But I want to keep trying, mostly out of spite. I’ve been at the mercy of my reproductive system since I started menstruating, and I don’t want all that agony to be for nothing. The only reason I haven’t pushed for a hysterectomy yet was because I was reassured that I was most likely able to carry a pregnancy to term.

Our options seem to be:

1. Try again until we have a successful pregnancy. Get a hysterectomy ASAP after delivery.

2. Get fibroids removed, wait until we can try again, and try until we get a successful pregnancy. Get a hysterectomy when the fibroids grow back enough to cause problems again.

3. Find out we can’t have a healthy pregnancy. Get a hysterectomy. Adopt.


What I don’t want to do is wait. My husband is leaning towards taking a break, but I’m in pain no matter what. If we take a break, we’re just prolonging it. The part where my hormones go back to normal after a loss is awful, but every month is awful when I’m not pregnant anyway. 


We’re both indifferent about having a biological kid, but we wanted to try for that first because it seemed cheaper and easier. If it isn’t either of those things, there is no advantage to us having a biological kid at all. We want to be parents, and I want to stop being in so much pain, so whatever gets us there is what we want.

One year ago it was CD1, my first day of my period and I was fucking giddy. I had no more birth control refills, a new thermometer, and a bulk bag of OPKs and pregnancy tests. I warned my husband, it might take a while to get pregnant but that I'm going to track everything because when I was barely 18 I was told I wouldn't get pregnant without fertility treatment. He was smug and just knew that I would get pregnant right away. 

First cycle and we hit the fertile days hard. This was easy, we were on vacation with no responsibilities. Then at 10 DPO I test early and get a stark white pregnancy test. I'm bummed and then start spotting the next day. I had a lot get period but didn't think much of it. On what I thought was the CD9 I woke up for work and I felt a mini gush and there was one reasonable sized spot of blood on my patties in the morning. I knew that I was pregnant and losing it. I grabbed a pregnancy test and took it with second morning urine at work. It was instantly positive, but things were not good. I'll spare all the details so that this doesn't turn into a novel but I spent the weekend in limbo because bleeding slowed only to have my HCG go down from 256 to 6 in about two weeks time. At this point this loss seems trivial and sometimes I even forget that it happened.

We took August off from trying jumped back in starting in September. I had an emotional meltdown when my leutal phase decided to increase itself from 10-12 days right in time for me to get my period (and Donald Trump as president) for my birthday. By December I had all but given up. Said fuck it, if I'm not pregnant on this cycle fuck all the tracking, I'm sick of temping, I'm sick of peeing on things and it's not helping so who the hell cares. Then I finally got a blazing positive OPK on CD21. We were so sick of having sex at that point, anyone else with long cycles knows how much this fucking sucks. Sperm meets egg plan was not meant for someone with a 40 day cycle. By that point your vagina is rubbed raw, seamen is dried up, and you just want to be down so you can get some fucking sleep. 

3 DPO, it's Christmas, and I look and my husband and say ""this shouldn't even be possible but I'm convinced I'm pregnant."" I actually manage to not pack my thermometer when we go away for New Years but when I go back to temping when we get back my chart ends up going triphasic. Hubs knows I'm pregnant when I can't get my shit together while cooking dinner one night and insist that the fish stinks. I waited until my period was officially late and my temps were still up to test because I couldn't take the possible heart ache of a stark white test and didn't want to deal with the stress of squinting.

I had all day nausea for my first trimester. I never vomited but I did lose close to 5 pounds. My first dating scan put growth at 10 days behind what I thought I was and freaked me the fuck out. My NT scan updated my due date to just one day ahead of what I knew was my due date all along. Baby was on track and perfect. With the second trimester upon me I felt fucking amazing. I felt seriously bad for all those that didn't feel this good. Yes I had some ligament pain or would get tired but overall I had a ""I can do this forever "" kind of feeling. At this point everyone became so convinced that I was having a boy that we all started referring to baby as he.

I had my anatomy scan at 20+1. I had a perfect baby boy growing on track inside me. Kicks were becoming really distinct and sometimes borderline painful when they hit the wrong spot. I also let myself start to really believe that I was going to bring a baby home with me. When my cervix looked good at the anatomy scan I was relieved. My mom lost multiple babies due to IC and hubs and I were worried that it might be genetic somehow but with no shortening or funneling I felt like we were in the clear.

On May 3rd I was starving all day. I had only gained 5 pounds at that point and was pleased with how things were going so I ate a lot that day. This includes a milk shake that I got as a treat on the way home from work. I snacked some more before dinner and then proceeded to make dinner. I played some of my favorite music and made sure to sing to my baby boy. I wanted him to be familiar with these songs for when he would be out in the world. Hubby has a standing video game night with the boys, so I hung out with him while they did the Xbox live thing. Around 1030 my stomach doesn't feel great so I decide to take the dog out and head upstairs. I make a bathroom stop and curse myself for eating to much dairy that day. When hubs comes to bed I tell him that dinner or something didn't agree with me, it's after 11 at this point when I'm finally going to bed. At 137 am I wake up to stomach cramps and thinking that I have bad gas but I figured I'll just get up and pee to save myself the trip in a hour or two. I'm gassy, barely pee but feel slightly better and head back to bed. I lay down and start to doze off but I wake up because of stomach cramps. They go away and I start to doze off again when they come back. This happens one more time and I realize that I can time these cramps. My head goes into a am I in labor whirlwind. I had funky discharge the other day, was that my mucus plug? I've heard some women have diarrhea before they go into labor, maybe it wasn't the milk shake. No see they're stopping it's just the milk shake. Oh god I'm nauseous, am I in transition? So I get up and head towards the bathroom again, I belch and feel instantly better and tell myself not labor definitely milkshake. So I sit down on the toilet again not knowing if I need to pee, poop, or puke and think that this is going to be a really long night and that work tomorrow is going to suck. No more milkshakes for me.

So I'm sitting there and I pee a little and I go to wipe and there's a faint bit of pink. I try to tell myself that it's nothing cause it's barely a spot but I'm starting to freak out. And then I hear the infamous pop and there's a gush that is definitely not pee, and then there is a second gush. I go to wipe and there's more blood, not a lot but enough to freak me out. I try pathetically yelling to my sleeping husband but I end up having to call him instead. I told him my water broke and showed him the bloody toilet paper. I distinctly remember saying ""this isn't good"" I threw a pad on, a dress, my rings and went to pull my hair back. Hubs told me to stop brushing my hair and start moving towards the door. When I come down the stairs I feel another gush, I run into the bathroom and my pad is soaked with blood. That was the longest 20 minute car ride I've ever taken.

I leave a puddle of blood on the floor of the ER before they get me into a wheelchair and off to L&D. They couldn't find Williams's heartbeat with the Doppler because it was too weak by that point. There was basically no fluid left when they did the ultrasound and I had a lot of bleeding. There was nothing to do but deliver at this point. We had to make the heartbreaking decision to induce me to deliver a baby that I knew would have no interventions to try and save him. My contractions had stopped at this point and doctors were worried about me developing an infection if we waited. Before they transferred me to a delivery room they pulled out the ultrasound machine again and my baby boy's heart had stopped. There was no saving him at this point. 

After talking to my nurse I was going to get an epidural before they started the induction meds. I wanted to be present in the situation but didn't want to feel pain or be traumatized by a painful birth. While waiting for the epidural I finally had another contraction, this one actually started to get uncomfortable and I felt like my body was pushing. I called for the nurse, ripped back the sheets and started to pull down the mesh underwear that I was wearing. With that one contraction he was half delivered, when the next came around I pushed and he slide out. They cleaned him up and I got to hold my boy for a couple of hours. The placenta also came out with little fan fare before being sent to pathology. My husband never held him or for that matter even looked at him. That may sound terrible but he knew that it was something that he would not be able to handle. He has seen the pictures that the nurses were kind enough to take.

So now here I am one year after we started trying and still not pregnant but definitely not with the journey that I thought that we were going to have. I've been dealing with the depression and anxiety that goes along with life events such as these. I'm worried that I'll never be able to enjoy another pregnancy because now I'm going to be a high risk pin cushion between a cerclage and 17P injections that will hopefully keep me pregnant long enough to have a viable baby.

And yet here we are thinking about trying again. We'll probably NTNP for the next couple of months and if nothing happens then I might get crazy with the tracking again. I've also started to look into getting extra insurance that will cover us if I get put onto bed rest and can't work. So we're here planning on a having a preemie after my doctor said she would be happy if I make it to 32 weeks. Now I don't give a shit about a birth plan all I want is one goes in 2 come home, even if it's not at the same time. I don't care who delivers my baby as long as that baby comes out and is able to come home with me. I get angry when people tell me that I'm strong and/or brave because of what I went through. I didn't fucking have a choice of what happened and just because I'm not hysterical most of the time or even when you see me does not make me a strong person. I'm just trying to deal with the shitty hand that I was dealt. This is not the path I expected to be on but I'm happy that I have my husband by my side for it.

When it happened, my older sister was already 3 months pregnant, and although it's been tough celebrating all the milestones with her, because I was already used to the idea and steeling myself to still be there for her and happy for her, it wasn't so bad.

But then, I got the news last night: my sister-in-law is 7 weeks pregnant. This was totally unexpected, because they weren't planning to try for another year or two until my brother-in-law is out of grad school. Although they say it was a ""surprise,"" I have a feeling that our pregnancy news (we told them the day we found out) may have spurred them on. Anyway - I am and want to be happy for them, but it's so hard, you guys. I never thought I'd be that person who cries when they find out someone else's happy news, but that was me: fetal position on the bed, and today just feeling dead inside. 

I know you've all been there, and I guess I'm just looking for advice. Is there anything else that heals but time? I so desperately want to be pregnant, but I haven't even ovulated in the 5 weeks since my MC (and I'm not even planning to try this cycle as per doctor's advice), so this is all feeling like the longest journey. 

Nothing feels more unfair than someone else unexpectedly getting pregnant, and to know that they hid it from you and pity you. I had been making progress every week, making peace with it, lighting a candle every night and talking to our lost friend, and now I feel like I'm back at the beginning and might never feel better.

It's my first time posting here. I'm feeling a bit lost. 2 weeks ago, I had to terminate our beautiful boy at 22 weeks for medical reasons. My SO and I were obviously devastated. I was fortunate enough to have a healthy, happy 7 month old DS to go home to which made things slightly easier.

We're both coping as well as you can, I guess. 

I'd just like some advice on when we should start to try for another baby? 
Obviously, we won't be trying until we're both emotionally ready. 

Body wise though, when is the optimum time to start trying? After 1-2 cycles?

I wanted to post our story as I have found comfort reading other experiences, knowing I'm not alone. You all seem like such a supportive group of people. 

On the 9th of June I finished work at 8pm. I'd felt my little boy moving all day, nothing out of the ordinary. That evening he was a little quieter than usual, but he had periods of being quiet so I didn't think much of it. Me and my partner got some fish and chips for dinner as I didn't feel like cooking. We chilled out on the sofa, I fell asleep and eventually we headed to bed around midnight. I didn't feel him move so I laid on my left side when we went to bed to try and feel some kicks - I must've fallen asleep like this, but still wasn't worried because he was quiet sometimes.

In the night I got up to pee around 4am. Again, no kicks. Usually he would kick me when I got up because I'd drink some water after peeing. This time, nothing. Got some cold juice, gave my bump a few prods...still nothing. Got in bed to try some counts. Nothing.

Around 6am I'd had enough. Something definitely wasn't right. I remember sitting in the lounge pleading with him to kick. Telling him he could kick me constantly or give me the dreaded lightning crotch as much as he wanted if he'd just wake up and kick me. I called the hospital and they told me to have some breakfast and a drink, that they were sure that by the time I came in for monitoring my boy would be kicking up a storm for me. 

I drove to the hospital as my partner doesn't drive. I really wasn't even letting myself worry too much at this point, because we's always said we had a troll baby on our hands who liked to mess with us.

We arrived at the hospital and were seen immediately by a lovely midwife. Took us to a room and she got the Doppler out. She was trying for a very long time to find his heartbeat, which was mega unusual. I'd just had a routine midwife appointment on the Thursday (this was Saturday) and my midwife never had a problem finding his heartbeat. At the appointment on Thursday she said everything sounded perfect, he was happy and healthy.

Anyway, first midwife says she needs to get the senior midwife to try and find it. She didn't say anything else but I turned to my partner and said she couldn't find the heartbeat...but again, I was trying not to panic. Second midwife comes in, again can't find it.

Tells us she needs to get a doctor to do an ultrasound. We were left alone for 10 minutes while this was arranged. By this point I was crying. I said to my partner that maybe he was in some distress or something and they could wheel me in for a c section then and there if needed...holding on to any hope that our baby was still alive in there.

The first doctor comes in, finds our boy. And there it was...We could clearly see our little boy's still heart. I let him poke around for a minute and said to him ""there isn't a heartbeat is there?"". He was very quiet then says he's sorry, there isn't a heartbeat. Another doctor is brought in to confirm everything.

We were hysterical. Inconsolable. I said I needed my mum, so I call her. All I could manage to say was ""mum, I've lost the baby."" She sounded so broken. This is the second time she's heard this - my brother and SIL lost their first little boy at 26 weeks a few years ago. 

So, we go through everything with the doctors. I was given the pill to ripen my cervix, told to come back if labour started, or Monday at 9am. 2 days to process things, to carry my still baby. 

Nothing happened and I was admitted on Monday. Given the pills to try and induce labour - nothing worked. By Wednesday the 14th I was started on a drip and eventually gave birth to George at 5:08pm, weighing 6lb1oz. 

I needed stitches because his head had deteriorated due to the long labour and I couldn't push him out. The midwife took him away (as per our wishes), then showed him to us. He was beautiful, but his skin was peeling off by this point and his head was...not right. We were moved into the bereavement suite and our families came to say their goodbyes. We consented to a post mortem, so if there was a reason hopefully we'll find out.

Now I'm just empty. So empty. Life feels completely unfair. Everything was perfect until suddenly it wasn't. I didn't have a high risk pregnancy, I flew through every appointment. I have such an unbelievable need for my baby. 

My family are all so supportive of us. My partner is wonderful and I think this will bring us even closer together. I hated every minute of pregnancy (HG, awful heartburn, swelling, hip and back pain...you name it). And honestly, he was a complete accident. I was devastated when I found out I was pregnant, but quickly came round to the idea of being a mum. We were so excited to become a family of three. 

I told my partner I need to think another baby asap. Not to replace our George, but to pour my love into. I hope my periods become normal soon, but I want to try and wait until at least September before trying, and getting the all clear from the doctor. 

What are your experiences of trying after a stillborn? I'm lucky that I am still entitled to a full year of maternity leave. My employer pays full salary for 18 weeks so I'm going to use that time to grieve and get healthy and start thinking about trying. Am I being mad thinking about trying in such a short time frame? My mind is just all over the place. 

Thanks for reading and I'm sorry for the wall of text! I guess I just needed to get it all out.

<p>The first doctor comes in, finds our boy. And there it was...We could clearly see our little boy&#39;s still heart. I let him poke around for a minute and said to him &quot;there isn&#39;t a heartbeat is there?&quot;. He was very quiet then says he&#39;s sorry, there isn&#39;t a heartbeat. Another doctor is brought in to confirm everything.</p>

<p>We were hysterical. Inconsolable. I said I needed my mum, so I call her. All I could manage to say was &quot;mum, I&#39;ve lost the baby.&quot; She sounded so broken. This is the second time she&#39;s heard this - my brother and SIL lost their first little boy at 26 weeks a few years ago. </p>

<p>So, we go through everything with the doctors. I was given the pill to ripen my cervix, told to come back if labour started, or Monday at 9am. 2 days to process things, to carry my still baby. </p>

<p>Nothing happened and I was admitted on Monday. Given the pills to try and induce labour - nothing worked. By Wednesday the 14th I was started on a drip and eventually gave birth to George at 5:08pm, weighing 6lb1oz. </p>

<p>I needed stitches because his head had deteriorated due to the long labour and I couldn&#39;t push him out. The midwife took him away (as per our wishes), then showed him to us. He was beautiful, but his skin was peeling off by this point and his head was...not right. We were moved into the bereavement suite and our families came to say their goodbyes. We consented to a post mortem, so if there was a reason hopefully we&#39;ll find out.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m just empty. So empty. Life feels completely unfair. Everything was perfect until suddenly it wasn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t have a high risk pregnancy, I flew through every appointment. I have such an unbelievable need for my baby. </p>

<p>My family are all so supportive of us. My partner is wonderful and I think this will bring us even closer together. I hated every minute of pregnancy (HG, awful heartburn, swelling, hip and back pain...you name it). And honestly, he was a complete accident. I was devastated when I found out I was pregnant, but quickly came round to the idea of being a mum. We were so excited to become a family of three. </p>

<p>I told my partner I need to think another baby asap. Not to replace our George, but to pour my love into. I hope my periods become normal soon, but I want to try and wait until at least September before trying, and getting the all clear from the doctor. </p>

<p>What are your experiences of trying after a stillborn? I&#39;m lucky that I am still entitled to a full year of maternity leave. My employer pays full salary for 18 weeks so I&#39;m going to use that time to grieve and get healthy and start thinking about trying. Am I being mad thinking about trying in such a short time frame? My mind is just all over the place. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I&#39;m sorry for the wall of text! I guess I just needed to get it all out.</p>

Previous mc 4 months ago. Brown medium bleeding which has become lighter in flow recently but is there every time I visit the loo for 10 consecutive days now.

Had a private scan and a NHS scan a couple days after the bleeding started and neither could see anything at all. I've had bloods taken every 48hours which have detected the hcg level has increased every time. They have increased from 4400 to 7000 to 7600 and today 11800. Had another scan on Friday and although ovaries looked perfect, the technician did see a ""void"" area in my uterus which could either be the start of a gestation sac (which would be 3weeks behind schedule for a normal pregnancy) or simply a small blood clot waiting to pass.

Consultant now wants another scan done tomorrow morning and there has been talks of a laparoscopy procedure if the scan is still inconclusive. I'm not in any pain or having any pregnancy symptoms at all and I'm 100% certain I have my cycle/ovulation/positive result dates totally accurate. No doubt about it. 

My mum joked yesterday that maybe it's twins and I lost one, which is funny because I have a twin sister and it runs in the family. But surely the size of the gestation sac would still be too small for this far along in a pregnancy as I'm meant to be 8w tomorrow. 

Anybody had a similar experience? I'm thinking more towards the ectopic theory but surely I'd be in some pain? I've packed an overnight bag in my car just in case and given my boss a heads up that I might not be in tomorrow but who knows. Confused!

After that, my husband felt ready to try again, but I wanted to wait. We decided to not use birth control and just see what happened. I got pregnant again in April and miscarried just a few days after finding out.
I feel so empty. I want a baby so badly (especially since my original due date has passed) but I feel so terrified of trying. I feel like I'm flip flopping every other day, sometimes feeling totally ready and other times absolutely not. Even when we're not trying I get so disappointed every single time I have a period.

Part of my conflicting emotions is due to the fact that I really hated being pregnant. I felt sick the whole time and I was so excited to pass the 12 week point and hopefully start feeling better, then the miscarriage happened. I feel like I got ripped off. (For lack of a better phrase.)

(I was 10 weeks along.) My HCG levels didn&#39;t drop to non-pregnancy levels until late December, so we couldn&#39;t have TTC even if we&#39;d wanted to. 
After that, my husband felt ready to try again, but I wanted to wait. We decided to not use birth control and just see what happened. I got pregnant again in April and miscarried just a few days after finding out.
I feel so empty. I want a baby so badly (especially since my original due date has passed) but I feel so terrified of trying. I feel like I&#39;m flip flopping every other day, sometimes feeling totally ready and other times absolutely not. Even when we&#39;re not trying I get so disappointed every single time I have a period.</p>

<p>Part of my conflicting emotions is due to the fact that I really hated being pregnant. I felt sick the whole time and I was so excited to pass the 12 week point and hopefully start feeling better, then the miscarriage happened. I feel like I got ripped off. (For lack of a better phrase.)</p>

Thing is, I want to TTC again and soon (doc okay'ed it after 3-6 months) but there are about 15 lbs I'd love to lose - honestly, just 10. I was itty bitty when I got preggo at 115 lbs - went up to 141 lbs and now am 128 (and fluctuate to 130 on a daily basis).

Is it advisable to go ahead and try with the extra weight? Or should I wait to TTC after I lose more weight? If I could get down to 120 I'd be happy. Even 125!

It's the first time we feel like we have a guaranteed hope that we can have children at last, because the clinic will continue to try with your frozen embryos (either yours or donor eggs) until they are successful.

When we were looking to connect with parents in the US, it was truly through a network of folks that we got to talk to them to hear about the process, which reassured us that we're not going to be scammed or have trouble bringing our future babies back home.

I saw a hematologist this week and was told with daily baby aspirin and daily blood thinner injections, I have nearly normal chances of a successful pregnancy next time.</p>

<p>We haven&#39;t decided if we will still go ahead with IVF or just try naturally again, but just knowing there is something definitively wrong and that it can be treated is making me feel so alive right now.  Maybe we actually will have a child one day.  </p>

I went into labor at 39+1 and we went to the hospital early the next morning. They couldn't find a heartbeat. It has been such a devastating time for us. We have a 2.5 year old daughter who is just now starting to grasp the idea that the baby died-- we have to have a lot of repetitive talks about how he was in mama's tummy, but something happened and he died, so he can't live at home with us. 

We don't know conclusively what went wrong, but my midwife laid out a pretty good case for cord damage-- it was a little frayed, she noticed, when she clamped it, and the amniotic fluid appeared to have a good deal of blood in it.

My son is two months old and my friend was 30 weeks pregnant. Literally five minutes ago I got a call telling me her baby has passed away. 

Earlier in the day she texted me, panicked (like she does with every pregnancy symptom), about decreased fetal movement. I told her than my son had had moments of silence a few times and I went to the ER, and that I would drink a sugary cold drink before hand to see if I could wake him up. She got herself a drink and went on with her day for awhile. I never was updated, but I just figured she was busy. 

Well I just got a call telling me she's going in for potentially an emergency c-section to have the baby *removed*...they're using the word *removed*, like she's some sort of tumor inside of my friend. We joked our kids would be married. She was coming to my house in a week to rifle through baby clothes. Her baby shower is in a few days. 

I experienced a mid-pregnancy loss before (not as far as 30 weeks, though) so why is it so hard for me to know what to do? I want to scream at the doctors and tell them they're wrong, and I want her to hold her baby when she's born and just see her okay. But that's not going to happen. 

I also kinda feel like it's my fault, because I told her to drink a sugary drink when I could've said GO TO THE ER IMMEDIATELY NOW! But would that even have saved her? I don't know. And I'm not going to interrogate my friend about it right now either. Way earlier in the pregnancy I told her I had a ""feeling"" she would be born a little early and we'd see her soon. Now I feel like an ass over that comment. 

What do I do? I'm visiting without my son asap, which is not right now (nobody's available to watch him short notice at 1am). I'll be at the hospital in the morning to see her. Should I bring something? Ice cream? I'm having my mom watch my son so she doesn't have to be subjected to my healthy baby during this time. WHAT DO I DO?? I am just staring at my son right now feeling guilty that *he's* alive while *she* didn't make it. How is that fair? I'm grateful that my son is alive, but now my friend has to see him for the rest of her life while her baby didn't make it. I offered to babysit her baby. So much is different. I'm rambling. 

What do I do? Should I visit now with my baby? I don't have anywhere to take him but is it not cruel to bring my healthy son around her? I want to see her, too. Oh my god.

<p>What do I do? Should I visit now with my baby? I don&#39;t have anywhere to take him but is it not cruel to bring my healthy son around her? I want to see her, too. Oh my god. </p>

<p>Edit: i definitely can&#39;t visit her until the morning. </p>

I was sat next to a young woman (looked barely out of her teens) with her mother, nice big baby bump on her and she had already had her appointment and was just waiting for her midwife follow up from what I overheard. So the woman and her mother were ooo-ing and aaaah-ing over her scan photo saying things like ""so that's the baby's head and if you turn the picture this way I think that's it's arm"", and ""oh look Jenny I think that's it's bum sticking up, doesn't that look funny"".

Last night upon waiting for friend’s birthday shindig to start at restaurant, my best friend tells me she’s pregnant – 2.5 months (10 weeks) and I just start bawling in this very public place and am so angry and get up to collect myself. Why tell me this in 1. Public and 2. On friend’s birthday, effectively stealing her birthday thunder and making the conversation about that instead? 

She says she understands I’m upset – she didn’t know how to tell me. I tell her, No you don’t understand because your baby didn’t die and you already have a son. I lost mine and I never get him back. You get to have a parent experience already. My first baby died. You don’t get it. 

It was the worst dinner ever and I could hardly look at her. She’s knocked up by her ex who is not the best guy and she’s been “dumping” for the last 2 years. He was essentially stalking her for a time. I can hardly stand to see pregnant people. Let alone my bestie, who is going to have a child within the year of me losing mine and I will now get to see that kid grow up and hit all the milestones my son never will. Her baby is going to be a trigger baby for me.

And it just feels like the universe is playing a joke on me and everyone’s in on it except me. Why does everyone else get a baby? Why can’t I have 1? Most of my friends are on their second now. 

I acted like a child. I was so angry and upset and crying and I hate myself for it. I don’t want to see her. We were planning a beach weekend getaway in the coming weeks cause I desperately need it and I don’t want to see or talk to her at all now.

And I know of my friends, I will be the only one to suffer this stillbirth fate. I took the hit for them, being the 1% so they can all go on to have excellent pregnancies with awesome outcomes. They will prob ask for additional monitoring and everything because of me and my little baby will be buried for all eternity under the ground with all my hopes and dreams. 

My best friend made a painting for my son with a psalm on it and I want to chuck it in the trash. Her child will get to have their own paintings and my son never will because he is buried at the cemetery, undeserving of his death with ""no cause.""
