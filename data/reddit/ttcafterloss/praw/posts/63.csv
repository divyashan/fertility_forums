On Friday I did an interview for someone in my community for her to write a book or create a podcast. It's all about mom's who struggled with identity and other things becoming moms. I've struggled with many things since becoming a Mom. PPD, miscarriage, infertility, going back to work, not being the mom I though I would be. The list goes on. I figured I would be a perfect candidate for an interview. It went great. Had some really difficult moments and many tears when talking about the miscarriage and getting through those first anniversaries and everything.

I was raw emotionally by the end of it. 

Get to work, new girl is pregnant. And not like ""Is she pregnant....??"" no, girl is like 6 or so months pregnant. The belly is there, it's clearly pregnancy and not an extra 10 or 15lbs. 

Now we come to the point in this whine where I'm a gigantic asshole. I recognize I'm being judgemental and an asshole. I know it. But I can't help the way I feel given everything that has happened to me.

Where I live, like many other places right now, there's a serious issue with opiods. We've had to set up overdose prevention sites, safe injection sites the whole bit. It's getting bad here. It's a good time when we only find out about 1 overdose death a week, often attributed to fentanyl these days.

This girl looks like she may be a user. Now, I also recognize she may have been previously, but is clean. But the outwards aesthetic of being a drug user doesn't always change fast, and for some, never changes. Some people will perpetually look like they use drugs even when they've been clean for years and years.

I just remember feeling this white hot rage. This woman, who I assumed (which I know isn't fair) is or was a user, is pregnant. Likely has social services sniffing around constantly, she's pregnant (and based on her tattoos, with her third) and here I am, all I want is a baby and I can't have one. I live a relatively healthy life, I care for my existing child, and have a stable life with my husband, but in some weird cruel joke, I can't have a second child?! It's just not fair, I know life isn't fair, but come on. Throw me a fucking bone once in a while.

To top it all off, a friend and her wife just announced the arrival of their triplets. Everyone is good, babies are looking great, are going to be in NICU for a while as they had to be born quite early (based on my mostly uninformed look at the pictures, I'm guessing late 20's early 30's in terms of weeks)I am over the moon for them. They have had to deal with a whole bunch in their quest to become parents since they are a same sex couple. And to have triplets means there's going to be a whole lot of extra to deal with as their babies are premature. I'm so happy they are doing well and everyone seems to be okay and stable medically. But again, Why can't I have that baby? Why don't I get to see all those congratulation messages on my facebook feed?

All I want is a positive test....

Oh, and we are 6 days away from my period, and really being able to test for sure if I'm pregnant, and I'm starting to have some general cramping and pink spotting. Just great.

Everytime I start to think I'm feeling better, i'll get an email in my inbox saying ""you are in your XXX month of pregnancy!"".No i'm not. I have unsubscribed, filtered to spam but every so often they get through.

Then 2 friends also announce they are pregnant. One says ""i'm 6 weeks along""....and i'm sat there like....hunny, that's a bit early to tell us all on a WhatsApp group chat, we are actually all course friends, so we aren't friends in life as we are spreadt out all over Europe. The other friend is due the same week as I would have been.

Then I have a close work collegue who had a miscarriage earlier in the year (at 12weeks) , who told me she is 4 months pregnant. I didn't even say congratulations to her, i just smiled and then the conversation went on with children running aorund so maybe she didnt notice but I felt SO PISSED at myself . I was, of course, jealous/envious of her, but sent her a message the next day saying congratulations and that, at least, seeing her had given me hope. I think she understood/didn't notice.

I just feel like there are CONSTANT reminders everywhere, and that along with the fact that my period is EVERY DAMM MONTH since seems to be a couple of days late, you know, just enough to mess with me.

Back to school/work tomorrow, I haven't seen my husband in 3 weeks because he is on a business trip, i've barely had a summer off because I moved classrooms.

My husband and I met with the RE today. We have one living healthy 4 year old and had three losses this year. The doctor thinks it is most likely a genetic issue and is recommending IVF with preimplantation screening. Our insurance covers IVF but not the screening so it would cost us about $4000 which is a lot for us because my husband is a grad student. Our alternative is to keep trying on our own and risk having more losses. We are waiting for results of chromosome testing and hopefully that will give us more information. 

I’m just wondering if any of you have had to make a similar decision. What factors did you consider in making the decision? Are you happy with what you ultimately decided? Any thoughts would be more than welcome! Thanks

​

I'm a physician and reporter with National Public Radio's science desk in Washington, DC. I am looking for anyone who has experienced an early pregnancy loss who would be willing to share her story -- with her name -- for an article I'm working on.

​

I'm particularly looking for somebody who was prescribed mifepristone (mifeprex) for early pregnancy loss and can discuss their experiences accessing this medication.

​

It's usually prescribed in addition to misoprostol (cytotec), and I'm looking for women who have taken both together. There is new research out in the New England Journal of Medicine this summer showing that using the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is more effective than misoprostol alone, and more and more doctors are prescribing this regimen. Please email me at [mgordon@npr.org](mailto:mgordon@npr.org) !

I had a D&C performed and little did I know how traumatic that would be as well as the physical/emotional healing process. I bled for over two weeks, passing blood clots and having to get my uterus suctioned out again weeks after the initial D&C due to my uterus being full of old blood and large blood clots. 

Fast forward to over two weeks ago, the doctor had given us the okay to TTC. Which I jumped right on board as well as my husband because we still desperately want a baby. We’ve been actively trying for over two weeks now. Which now has made sex feel like a chore more than anything else, and is now starting to take a toll on my husband because I am not physically enjoying it all. 

Despite it all, and TTC. I am still grieving over the loss of my baby. All the what if’s constantly run through my mind. It seems like that’s all I can ever think about... it seems like it’s what consumes me day in and day out. No one tells you what mentally comes after loss... I’ve gained so much anger that I feel like I cannot even control it. Which usually my husband feels the effects of... I have always suffered with anxiety, even before my loss. But I feel as it has become even worse leading to some depression. I have been lucky enough to have a great husband who has taken the roll of everyday tasks despite having a full time job (I have two older children from a previous relationship). I know he try’s to fully understand and grasp my grieving... he constantly wants me to talk and tell him what is on my mind in hopes that they will help me with the process. I have yet to tell him that I believe that I am depressed, only because of the fact that I do not want him to worry any more than he has to. It feels so hard to open up to him at times... Which leads to anger because I feel as if he cannot truly relate because he has not physically been in my shoes. And deep down, I know that is wrong to view it that way because he suffered from the loss too. But somehow I cannot kick that thought... I know he wants me to happy, even more now that we’re TTC but I don’t know how to go about it. 

How do I explain to my husband how I’m really feeling and to not be so closed off with him? I want to address my anger and depression issues with him, but I am not sure how to go about it.

My husband and I have been talking about what we want to do about the baby. For a while, we really didn’t want to know if baby was a boy or a girl because we thought it would make things harder for us, because we both really wanted a girl. We weren’t going to find out the sex until birth, so now that we’re in this position, we are doubting not finding out. We are feeling like we should maybe decide on a name because to not name it would sort of make me feel like we’re treating the baby like it didn’t matter or that we didn’t love it enough to name it. Part of me thinks if we lost the baby at 8 weeks, I know I wouldn’t feel that way, but now that I’m almost 20 weeks, I’ve felt the baby and have bonded with it more, so it feels different.

We also decided to definitely get footprints, but I’m also debating on if I want to see it and/or hold it or not. This is a D&E and I’ve read baby doesn’t always come out very nicely so maybe it’s not a good idea, but I’m not sure. We also talked about donating it to a nearby hospital if it’s an option, because dealing with the hassle of a funeral home to cremate sounds daunting and just like added stress, especially since we’re already 2.5 hours away from home.

I don’t know, I guess I’m just looking to know what others of you have done and how it affected you, if you’d do it differently, etc. Any input and perspective is greatly appreciated. Sorry if this was kind of all over the place, that’s kind of a reflection of my brain at this point.

ETA hospital is not an option for us as it’s not covered by my insurance, going to the clinic is expensive enough, so unfortunately L&D is also not an option. I looked more into the D&E procedure to know if I could hold the baby, and after about 30 seconds of reading, it’s pretty clear I don’t want that even if I was given the option. My husband is as yet against cremation and keeping the ashes because he thinks that would be too painful for him. I sort of feel the same way, but I’m hoping they’ll allow us to donate the remains to a hospital for research purposes. If it isn’t an option, I have to do something because I don’t just want it thrown away.

In July of last year, I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. My husband and I were full of excitement because our DD was just turning one and this was our “ideal” age gap. Long story “short”, I ended up going to the doctor a few weeks before my scheduled 8 week appointment due to cramping and spotting.  They monitored my HCG levels by taking my blood every. Damn. Day. Sometimes twice a day.  Finally after a week of blood being drawn and levels going up but sadly not doubling, they did an ultrasound.  What we saw was an empty sac right there on my Fallopian tube. I was sent straight to triage and given methotrexate.

Now, when the doctor first gave us the official news, we were both shocked and clearly disappointed. She gave us the room, and I started to cry. My husband, who is always way too rational for his own good, told me not to cry because as the doctor sad, there was never really any baby. 

A year has come and gone, and we have been trying for another since November. I have taken a test every single month since then and the negative results just get harder and harder to see. 

I’ve thought about the ectopic pregnancy every single day. Some days it makes me sad, some days it’s just a fact of life. But lately, I’ve been seeing SOOOO many babies being born and so many pregnancy announcements, it’s just been really getting to me. Today, I straight up broke down. I started to cry and my husband asked if I was okay. When I told him I was sad about not being pregnant, he said we just have to give it time. And when I said I was also really sad about the pregnancy we lost last year, he said I couldn’t be sad about it because it wasn’t really anything to begin with. In his mind, I didn’t lose a baby. I didn’t lose a “pregnancy”. I didn’t lose anything. He even let me know that it wasn’t a miscarriage.... like I wasn’t aware of that. It turned into big thing and we got so far off track that I eventually just decided to drop the whole thing.

I wish he understood my pain. Yeah, there was no “real baby”. But there was still a time in my life last year that I believed there was. I saw the positive test. I felt the nausea. It was short lived, but it happened. This is a weird, grey area I guess. I don’t know anyone else who has experienced this and I don’t have anyone to turn to. So here I am, on the Internet hoping a stranger will understand exactly where I’m coming from and help me to help my husband understand why this is hard and why it hurts me more that he thinks my pain is not real.


TL;DR: husband doesn’t understand why previous ectopic was hard because there was “no baby, just a sac”. Need to get him to open his eyes.

I’ve been in hospital for 31 hours now and had two doses (24 hours apart) but my cervix is still closed and my body is blithely pretending it’s still pregnant. They think it may be because I am (was) pregnant with identical twins that my hormone levels are just extremely high still but I’d be pleased to know if anyone has had anything similar.

I’ve tried walking and being active. I’ve been advised to try not to get stressed or upset (notwithstanding the circumstances) because that will lower the oxytocin levels which I need to be high to stimulate the birthing process.

I just had my d&e, but I’m the kind of person who needs a plan. Can you please tell me about using OPKs and tracking ovulation after a d&e?

When did you start testing ovulation? Was your first period obviously different than post-procedure bleeding?

I need to get some agency back in all this and I think knowing what to expect will help.

First of all I just wanted to say thank you so so so so much to everyone who commented on my post a few weeks ago after my 2nd miscarriage. This community is literally the only place I feel comfortable telling my story because no one ever truly gets it.

So this might be really weird but I'm curious to hear everyone's miscarriage stories. Not how you found out, but the actually stats (I'm not sure what word I'm looking for) on it. 

Had you heard the heartbeat? How far was baby measuring? Did they find a cause for it? Etc.


Here are mine:

1. I found out at 20+2 weeks, but baby was measuring 16 weeks. Last confirmed heartbeat was heard at 17+4.
Cause: placental abruption (not sure the cause for the PA though)

2. Found out at 10 weeks, baby measured 9+6. Last confirmed heartbeat was heard at 9+5.

Cause: unknown 


Maybe it's morbid, but I feel like both mine were really out of the blue so I'm curious to see who had similar situations or opposite ones.

Last year at this time my husband and I terminated our very much wanted pregnancy after finding out that the baby had anencephaly. We got pregnant again about 5 months later and assumed that the anencephaly was just a fluke and we would have a healthy pregnancy. Unfortunately this one ended in a miscarriage discovered at our first ultrasound at 8 weeks. We again assumed this was just bad luck and wouldn’t happen again. We got pregnant again in June and this time had early weekly blood tests and ultrasounds with an RE.  Everything looked great at 8 weeks 5 days but then at 9 weeks at the ob there was no heartbeat. I had a d&c last week, my third in one year. 

My family all knows what happened but only my grandmother has acknowledged it explicitly (she had two miscarriages herself). Everyone else either didn’t say anything or gave me a concerned sounding “how are you?” To which I just answer “fine.” My mom asks me how I’m doing “emotionally” and I have no idea how to answer so I just say “fine”.

I&#39;m really scared of another ectopic, but at the same time ivf is expensive and invasive, and if there&#39;s even a tiny chance I can have a normal pregnancy the natural way, is it not worth the risk? What do you guys think? Anyone had a normal pregnancy from the damaged tube?</p>

I’m new here. DH and I are on cycle 5, and I had a CP 13 days ago. This was my first known loss. It’s been a weird and sad week, but I feel grateful for my sweet hubby’s support. 

I’m wondering when I’m likely to ovulate again. I know some people O pretty much right on schedule. If I still have HCG in my system, would that stop me from ovulating? Or maybe HCG and O are independent from one another?

What’s weird is that, 12 days after my CP, I started getting progesterone symptoms— sore boobs and zits. My body feels like it ovulated. But, I’ve never ovulated before day 16, and usually more like day 18-19. Could the CP have made me ovulate early?? Or maybe these symptoms are related to the CP and not related to post-ovulation progesterone? FWIW, my HCG level was down to 17 on the day I started getting sore breasts and acne.

We were TTC for 2 years when we conceived our son (1 year ago today). We were diagnosed with ""unexplained"" infertility. All tests normal for both of us. We ended up conceiving with the help of Femara and Follistim. I found out on my Husband's birthday and told in a super corny way (gave him a card ""from"" our baby and the pregnancy tests I took). Pregnancy was great; no problems other than marginal previa that cleared up around 20 weeks. Our son was VERY active and spent a lot of time with his feet in my ribs. I had an NST on 5/1; one days before my due date, and everything was great. I was super uncomfortable, so OB agreed to schedule an induction for the 5/8 which would put me at 40+6. 


&nbsp;


On Friday 5/4 my water broke around 11:30 PM so we headed to the hospital. When we got there and they were hooking me up to monitors the nurse was having a hard time finding heartbeat, but I was staying positive because sometimes he would move and it would take a second to find him. They decided to bring in an ultrasound to see where he was. The nurse did a quick scan and said it was just for positioning and she was going to have the Dr. come in. I knew right then that something was wrong. When the doctor came in and started scanning she was very quiet for what seemed like several minutes so I asked (yelled) if something was wrong a couple times. That was when she said that he didn't have a heartbeat. I could see it on the screen; I could see his heart just not beating. In that moment I thought I was going to die and I thought I was having a nightmare all at the same time. 
They game me an epidural pretty quickly and I labored for about 12 hours before our son was delivered. 

&nbsp;


Delivery itself was pretty easy except for the fact that I was delivering my dead son. 
Cole Robert was born at 11:51 on 5/5, weighed 6lbs 6oz, and was 20 in long. He was absolutely perfect. He had a full head of beautiful black hair and long skinny fingers and toes. We asked the nurse to tell us what color his eyes were and they said they were bright blue (just like mine). We were fortunate enough to have an AMAZING nurse that was with us around the clock. I honestly don't know how we would have made it through any of it without her. I can never repay her for the care and kindness she showed us. We took TONS of pictures and a NICU nurse also took some for us. We have casts of his hands and feet and some of his hair. Instead of coming home with him we came home with a box and pictures. That is all we have of him.

He died as a result of a prolapsed cord. His cord was almost completely delivered before he was. Apparently it is extremely rare and our nurse said in her 20 years in L&D she had only seen it happen 1 other time and the result for that poor family was the same. We were told that the only way he could have been saved was if it happened while someone was checking my cervix, and even then it would have likely been the same result as they only would have had less than 10 minutes to get him out while someone was pushing he head back. 

&nbsp;


It's been 3 months and I am just starting to feel a little bit ""better"". I still cry almost every day, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming. We started trying again with the support of my OB and our psychologist (who has probably saved us both from going completely crazy), and I'm currently 7 dpo. We are both extremely worried that we will have to go through the same things to have another child. I have this fear that our son was the only chance we had and he was ripped away.

We have a 27 month old boy - when I was pregnant with him I had no issues or complications. We got pregnant in March of 2017 which ended in a miscarriage - for this pregnancy my HCG never went above 280 and I had no pregnancy symptoms so we kinda saw it coming. We got pregnant again in September 2017 but found that it was a pregnancy of the unknown location and we ended up getting a shot of methotrexate. Again, no real pregnancy symptoms and my HCG was only at about 5000 in week 7.  With these two losses I was still breastfeeding and I think might have been the reason for losses. I got pregnant again June 2018 and this time around had really bad symptoms and was getting blood draws from the day I got a positive test. Everything looked great so far! We even saw a heartbeat when we went in to an emergency appt because of some mild spotting and cramping. Last friday was my checkup and we found out that the week prior the baby had stopped developing. We were give the options of wait for me to miscarry, a D&C, or taking a pill at home. I took the pill and it was okay. I feel heartbroken but I think there might have been something wrong with the fetus this time. I don't think there is anything wrong with me. 

I don't know exactly what I am looking for. Is there anyone who has had these many losses? I go in for my follow up next week and the doctor will ask if I want to take a thyroid test or an autoimmune blood clotting disease test.

I have a 13 month old daughter and my pregnancy with her was healthy with no complications. It took me about a year for my husband and I to conceive her, as I learned that my ovulation is very sketchy. During my TTC journey the first time around, I had a few 65+ day cycles.

We started TTC for baby #2 in April and ended up getting pregnant on my second cycle in May. I was tracking ovulation for both cycles and ovulated around CD30 both times. That pregnancy ended with a miscarriage around 8 weeks. 

The miscarriage itself was pretty mild, little to no cramps and moderate bleeding. It really just felt like a heavy period. I did not need any medical intervention in the way of medication or a D&C/D&E. My OBGYN tracked my HCG down to 0 (it took 3 1/2 weeks). 

The dilemma:

When I was given my results for my last HCG test over the phone, they told me that they recommend waiting one cycle before TTC again. When I asked for a reason why, they kind of stumbled over their words and said it was really just for dating purposes. I have read a lot of conflicting information about waiting 1-3 cycles for various reasons (some include how one miscarried... natural vs. D&C/D&E). 

After my HCG returned to 0, I started tracking ovulation using OPKs again. My reasoning was that it would really give me peace of mind knowing IF I am ovulating and when. If I wasn't tracking, I know I would be a wreck. I am now on CD34 and have gotten a clearly positive OPK 2 days in a row. My husband and I discussed waiting one cycle vs TTC right away and have been wavering back and forth. 

That being said, the one time we didn't use protection was the night before my first positive OPK. I feel like I'm doing something wrong...

Since my cycles are on average 45+ days long, I have a hard time knowing that every time I don't conceive, I have to wait for so long before even thinking about trying again. I hope this doesn't come across as whiny or insensitive, I just need a place to put down what I am feeling and going through. 

Does anyone out there have a similar experience that they'd be willing to share?

It is also an area for those in early pregnancy or pregnancy limbo to post (prior to/instead of moving to r/PregnancyAfterLoss). 

This thread will be posted every Monday and remain stickied for the week, so you can post any day of the week. 

 **Please share positive pregnancy tests (BFPs) ONLY in this thread. Do not make a separate self-post about a BFP/subsequent pregnancy or post about it in the TTC daily thread.** 

 The purpose of this weekly post is so users can easily get an update on others' results. Also, as our Alumni move on to r/PregnancyAfterLoss, you can know who may be moving and keep track of them if you wish.
