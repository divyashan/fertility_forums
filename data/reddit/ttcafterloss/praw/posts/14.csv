I'm not 100% sure what to say for an intro so I'll just say what comes to mind. I guess I'll preface this by saying that DH and I aren't quite ready to try again yet. We'll have to at least wait till my hCG levels go back to 0 which could take a bit. I wanted to go ahead and introduce myself though and ask a couple of questions.

DH and I decided during the holidays last year that we wanted to try for a baby. We had the ""let's try"" talk when we got back home from traveling to visit our families. We ""tried"" (not very actively I suppose; more like not protecting) from January- August. In August I told DH it was taking a really long time and I'd decided it would probably be a good idea to start trying more actively. DH said we probably didn't really need to bother with all that but he wanted me to do whatever made me happy. So I ordered a basal body thermometer, 100 OPKs and paid for a subscription to Fertility Friend. In September I lost my grandpa, which was heartbreaking. DH and I had a moment of realization that the longer it takes us to have a LO the more likely we are to not have people who are important to us still around to share in our joy. DH only has 1 grandparent left (his grandmother) and she's 88. Suddenly, DH was glad I'd started temping, charting and all that nonsense to hopefully increase our odds in TTC. October 16th we were rewarded with our first BFP. I was absolutely over the moon and DH was cautiously optimistic. Around week 5 DH started to finally start feeling like it was ""real"" and started designing a crib (DH is big into woodworking) and planning how we're going to decorate the nursery.

Thursday (Nov 5th) at 6 weeks I started cramping and spotting. By Friday night it looked like the beginning of a period and the cramping was worse. This morning (Saturday the 7th) I started having severe cramping (too painful to even sit in a chair) and more bleeding until I passed globs of tissue. I'm going to call my doctor on Monday and see if she wants to do any blood work or anything to make sure I passed everything. DH and I are absolutely heartbroken. We talked about it before and agreed that if something went wrong and I miscarried that we'd try again as soon as I felt ready.

21,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello all. 


I'm not sure where to start after lurking here a while? I just had a D&C last week (they used the term evacuation). No bleeding or pain really until the 6th day after where I just felt ""periody"" and then bled throughout the afternoon. Nothing today.&nbsp;



I'm struggling with the grief. This baby came for us just as we'd been through the rigors of fertility diagnostics in August. We'd gotten the all clear and aside from needing some thyroid meds (high antibodies but an ok thyroid, my fertility specialist said they would reduce our risk of miscarriage). Well we fell pregnant early Sept.&nbsp;



All looked great until the 7 week scan where it looked liked a suspected blighted ovum. We went home, anxiously waited a week and at 8 weeks saw a heartbeat and a baby measuring 6&3.&nbsp;



I knew my dates weren't out but tried to stay hopeful. At that stage we transferred to an obgyn and at what should of been 9 weeks we received news that the baby hadn't grown and there was no heartbeat. Unfortunately the obgyn was away the next week on leave, so he transferred us to yet *another* obgyn who at 10 weeks confirmed the baby was still at 6 weeks, no heartbeat and so a D&C was performed the next day (a week ago today).&nbsp;



I am BROKEN mentally. At my age and given it took us 9 months (and a year off BC) to conceive I just can't help but feel like this is a big fat full stop to ever having a baby. I've seen my GP in conjunction with the obgyns etc and after trying valium to help me sleep, and now sleeping tablets for a short course (just to get me some rest - they aren't working though, I awake at 3am with nightmares), he's advocating for anti-depressants.&nbsp;



I see a therapist weekly. She's thinking yes to them too.&nbsp;



I just don't know?? She also advised a genetic blood test for MTFHR to see if my body is processing folic acid properly. She seems to feel that taking mega folic acid with the MTFHR gene = anxiety. It would mean adjusting to folinic acid I think? My GP wasn't very versed in it.&nbsp;



I guess I just want to touch base after lurking? I'm praying for my cycle to return so we can start TTC again. I only ever tracked via dates and EWCM (my cycle was clockwork at 27 days, I always spot before hand but fertility workup showed good progesterone so I was told that wasn't an issue).&nbsp;



But now I think OPK sticks might help me feel a bit more on top of it? Maybe even the Sperm Meets Egg Plan.&nbsp;



My GP / psych both think if I *do* get pregnant again I'll need medicating to cope with the 1st trimester anxiety.&nbsp;



I'm so confused right now and would appreciate anything anyone can offer in response. At 36, losing our first, I feel so alone. Our friends have all had their families. I met my husband at 33, married him at 34 and started off BC at 35 so it's not like I waited too long. I just had a crap marriage in my 20s, as did he. No prior kids for either of us.&nbsp;



Sorry to ramble. Thank you for listening.&nbsp;

UPDATE: I saw my GP last night after work and decided to get a script. We talked at length about which medication would be suitable to me for now and weighed it all up. I filled the script and started this morning.&nbsp;


He's seeing me weekly for a few weeks and has said if I start to turn a corner quickly we can conclude it was me and not the meds and view to simply stopping them a week in. If I need them longer, that too is ok. He very much has given me agency over how long I attempt them whilst gently advising that I'm spiralling and the anxiety cannot go on as is.&nbsp;


I see my therapist Wednesday and today I went for my first run in months. I'd had a head cold when I found out I was pregnant so had taken a week or so off my regular 5ks that keep me so balanced mentally. I stopped running out of fear as soon as I became pregnant. Today. I braved it. Tiny steps forward and a slow shuffle run but I did it.&nbsp;

I had a Blighted Ovum pregnancy around 5-6 weeks at the end of June (we never heard a heart beat or saw anything, just the sac). It was my first time getting a positive pregnancy test after trying for two years. I ended up having a D&C Aug. 17th. I had my first period starting Sept 30th and it last for a good two weeks, which my doctor didn't seem to be concerned with. On 10/26 I started my second period after my D&C and it is so heavy. Not crazy heavy, but I have just never had heavy periods. 

My two main questions are:

Should I be concerned that I only had a about a week of period free in between cycles? If you count 28 days from my first period on September 30th, this should be around I should be starting my period, but I didn't know if that was weird since the initial period lasted 2 weeks. 

The second question is should I be concerned that my periods are heavy now or is that something that happens after a D&C? (I am not having to change every 4 hours or anything, but I just am not used to a heavy period.)

This is my fourth pregnancy. Two uneventful, one ectopic and now... well, I guess I'm not sure yet. I know that I have long cycles, so when they did an early ultrasound to confirm the placement and the fetal pole was measuring small, I wasn't suprised. They put me at 5wk 5days based upon the sac size. No heartbeat, but I tried to remain calm. Today it has been almost two weeks since that first scan. 7wk 3 days, I guess? ( I don't trust my LMP at all). Tech didn't show me the screen at all this time, so I don't know what she saw. She said it looked like there wasn't much change to her, though. I had hoped for a black and white ""yay baby"" scan. Tech assured me that she doesn't read them, just sends them along to radiology. She offered to call and have me wait while it was read. Two hours later, she still had no luck. What do I do?  Is it over? Is there a chance it will all work out?

Complicated story.  The long and the short of it - I was not temping or tracking this month because I was out of state during what would have by timing been ovulation (the Friday before last).  I got back in state the following Monday, and that night and the next few we had unprotected sex.

Six days after (Sunday night), I have a little spotting.  Just a little, brownish - pretty much exactly what everything says implantation spotting looks like.  Spotting again yesterday, minimal, same color.  Urine pregnancy test this morning was negative, but I expected it to be.

But tonight, I'm getting a lot of cramping.  At baseline, I don't have cramps with menstruation.  A little more spotting, but still not like a period.  I shouldn't have my period until Friday, and historically I'm really regular.

It's just weird.  My body isn't working like it normally does.  Is my body trolling and just messing with me, getting my period a little early?  Is this something I need to be worried about?  Should I be peeing on sticks the next few days until I get a true period (hadn't planned to until Friday at the earliest)?

I know it's stupid... I just kind of thought with the timing, that it was really implantation bleeding.  And my friend just announced her pregnancy.  And my husband doesn't want to try right now, so this felt like my last chance for a bit.  Silly.

62,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone,

A few members here reached out to me after our second loss, so here I am. Most of the women in my life are pregnant without issue right now, so I'm kinda struggling to feel something other than completely alone.
My husband and I have been trying for our second baby since May. I got pregnant in August but just before I hit 5 weeks, I started bleeding and tests showed my HCG levels were only at 5.

The doctor I saw said there was no problem with trying again right away, so we did, and two cycles later got pregnant again. This time, the day before I hit 6 weeks I started bleeding, went to the hospital and learned that my HCG levels were in the 3-4 week range and although they could see a pregnancy with a transvaginal ultrasound, it was around the 4 week mark, too. My HCG dropped and the doctor said I could let my body take care of things on its own. It's been just over a week since then.

This second one is hitting me hard, and I feel like I'm grieving two losses at once. I know I am 'lucky' that both were early, but I really didn't think it would happen to me twice, and had completely let my guard down this time around. Every little thing is breaking my heart -- I thought I was doing better today, then stumbled across the prenatal appointment I had scheduled in my phone, had to delete it, and feel awful, now. I haven't been able to focus all day and have so much work on my to-do list that is sliding because I'm exhausted and sad but can't take sick time without losing money that we need. I'm so grateful to have my daughter, and my husband, but I know that there are pieces of me missing.

After the first loss I wanted to jump right back into TTC and my husband did, too. I felt like I wouldn't be whole again until I was pregnant. Being pregnant the second time helped a lot with my bad feelings from the first loss, and now, I would really, really like to be pregnant again. But I'm way more scared, now. The 'it won't happen again' feeling is gone. 

The doctor I saw (a resident at the ER) suggested taking a break, and threw 3-6 months out as a time frame though she said it was something various doctors would answer differently. I'm torn between throwing that out the window and just not trying, not preventing for the next little while, or taking extra time to deal with things. I know that getting pregnant again won't fix anything, emotionally, but I think I hate the feeling of endlessly waiting even more. And, if we have another loss, a third miscarriage allows for further testing through our health system and I would frankly rather get to that part sooner than later -- same for hitting one year of trying without success. 

I took a pregnancy test a few days ago and it was blank, so I'm guessing my HCG is somewhere back around the baseline. I didn't get any solid numbers from testing, all I know is that they weren't particularly high, and that they were dropping. Is it crazy to treat this like the first CP and jump back into things, albeit with less pressure than before? I know none of you are my doctors, but I'm just looking for some perspective.

On a side note: As all this stuff was going on I was noticing that my anxiety and insomnia were back to plague me (had been free of it for a few years) and my pain levels were a lot higher than normal (I have spent years in pain, but I am not the type to see a dr. I am a grit your teeth and get on with it girl), I was getting a lot of viruses and migraines and I was having a really hard time at work - it was like I was losing my mind, which was harder than anything else. My hair also started thinning at my temples. I thought I was just burning out and saw no reason to talk to the GP about it.


GP ran two sets of tests two weeks apart and booked an ultrasound. Ultrasound came back normal, hormones came back normal, most bloods came back normal but I had inflammation and elevated ANA levels. So off to the immunopathologist I go.


He did a full assessment, I told him about my pain, insomnia, thinning hair, migraines, viruses etc and he ran a whole heap of tests including a test for APS. All came back negative except for my ANA levels which he says are 'borderline high' and my inflammation levels which were 'somewhat high'. His diagnosis is fibromyalgia with no autoimmune disorder (like Lupus or APS).


Fibromyalgia is bang on the money now I have looked into it and I think I have been building up to it for a few years, its just the emotional stress of the CP's tipped me over the edge. But fibro as far as I can see, does not cause miscarriage.


That whole process was about 2 months long so after a 2 month break I am ready to get back into it, but now I am left wondering what to do next? We tried again this cycle but at 8dpo I don't think this is the cycle for us.

I'm curious of what to expect for this cycle.  I've done some searching and I'm seeing differing responses, but for the most part it seems like most women went on to have a pretty normal cycle but O'ed a little later than normal.    What was your experience?  

I was excited last cycle because I had used up the rest of my Wondfo OPK's and HPT's, which I had assumed was perfect because I was pregnant, right?  Right... just not for long.  I just got my new pack of OPK's and HPT's in the mail yesterday.  In an attempt to not waste any OPK's, I want to be sure I start using them at the right time (I had just gotten down the ""right time"" last cycle and now I have a cycle full of unknowns).  I'm nervous of being that weird one-off lady who O's super early this cycle and I'm going to miss it.  Do you recommend that I just start testing when I normally would for a normal cycle?

Well, I think I am finally ovulating again after my MMC and D&C on 9/24/15. I am really excited to feel those familiar twinges. And I'm not going to lie...I REALLY want to try again! Like...right now! I know there are some conflicting opinions about how soon is too soon to try after a D&C, so I thought I would ask if any of you have had similar feelings or started trying again soon after a D&C. 


For context, I should mention that my sister's wedding will be next year on 9/10/16, and it's across the country from me. I'm supposed to be the Maid of Honor. So strategically speaking, IF (god willing) I was going to get pregnant, I either have to do it RIGHT NOW (so that I have an infant during the wedding) or wait until early spring to try (so that I'm only 6-7 months pregnant during the wedding). So I guess I have this feeling that this is my only chance to try for the next few months. Is that crazy? I'm 31 years old, so it's not like I'm totally out of time, but I also have a strong sense that I'm not getting any younger...


Any advice or words of wisdom are very much appreciated.

So after days of reading your comments, talking to other family, and friends, I finally decided to reach out to my SIL. My BFF strongly suggested I **don't** write to her since tone can get lost in the written word and suggested I message/text her and ask her to call me when she had a chance to talk. I did just this yesterday and was frustrated that she saw it and didn't respond. *I need to remind myself I don't respond to everything right away and I don't have a hungry newborn.* 

She called this morning (literally minutes after I complained on the daily thread she hadn't yet) and we had a REALLY good talk. 

**First: My Loss**

She was really sympathetic about my loss and very supportive. She was a little sad that I hadn't told her earlier when she was pregnant and reminded me that I can talk to her about anything at any time. She said she will be ready to celebrate a baby whenever I am ready to try again and get pregnant. 

**Second: ""Real Kids""**

I then told her how her comments about our mutual friend (MF) not having real kids hurt me. I explained how far along MF was and that I needed a little time to cool off because it felt like a punch to the gut. Then SIL told me something I didn't know. Apparently, after her CP when she was very down she reached out to MF since she had experienced loss and MF posts A LOT about awareness of pregnancy and infant loss. She said MF responded once and then completely brushed her off and there was still a feeling of resentment. She said she was very hurt that MF posted so much about being there for people experiencing this grief and this disappeared when her own ""friend"" was going through something similar. She went on to say that her termination was a traumatic experience and the CP felt like a slap in the face and she tries not to think of them much and she didn't realize by denying her own feelings about them down that she would be discounting other people's pain.

**Third: Yes. We Talked About the Cheesecake**

I finally told her about my irrational anger about her insulting my cheesecake making skills. I told her that when she started suggesting recipes and techniques that I got upset because I *knew* the cheesecake was an experiment and when she said that it made me feel like **""Oh! You're better at making cheesecake *and* babies!!""** We had a good laugh and she reminded me that she is an only child, product of a single mother, and her communication skills are different than mine. She said that when she sees an opportunity for improvement she offers advice, it's how she's programmed and she forgets that it isn't always welcome. Knowing her mom is a classic narcissist (Most recently: We had to change the baby shower date because *she* didn't like it. Not couldn't go. Didn't like it. She did not help with *anything,* showed up almost an hour late, complained there were no forks for the buffet of finger foods, and didn't even thank me for hosting a shower for her daughter.) and I reminded myself how far she has come and how much she has grown in the 8 years I've known her. And then I thought about how much I've grown in 8 years and stopped, I don't need to think about how dumb I was. 

**Other Thoughts:**

We talked for a long time and I've completely forgiven her for the comments she made. I'm so glad I talked to her, I do love her, and I feel so much better about a lot of things. This has been weighing on me a lot heavier than I realized or let myself believe. I even discounted our relationship in my anger and that wasn't fair. 

So... I guess I just want to remind everyone that it's okay to talk to people who have hurt you. They may not have realized they did anything wrong and they may have their own shit going on you didn't know about. If you love each other, it might feel better to talk.

Thank you to everyone who was mad with me when I wanted to be mad, who gave me support, and who encouraged me to talk to her. 

You are all wonderful and I hope you have a great weekend.

Reminder - I had a textbook pregnancy (pee test, heart rate, blood pressure, temp, baby heart rate at every appointment) and Henry died from hypoxia because I had a small placenta. We never saw it coming, and we don't know why my placenta was small. 

A few months ago, a perinatologist talked with us for nearly an hour and a half and we really like her, but her ""prognosis"" is that she feels like it was just a fluke. As she put it, sometimes seeds grow better than others. Same with babies. She said there is genetic testing that can give indicators for certain blood clotting disorders but that they cost $800, insurance doesn't cover the cost, and her game plan wouldn't change if I were found to be positive. That knowledge wouldn't change anything for me or future baby, according to her. Her game plan for the next pregnancy is ultrasounds every 4 weeks (every week after 32 weeks I think?) and one daily baby aspirin. If my next baby measures behind or isn't growing as expected, we will schedule an early induction. If they do grow as expected, we will decide if we want to induce at 37 weeks for anxiety purposes. So ""Plan A"" is to see this perinatologist plus my original Family Doctor OB for cooperative care. The perinatologist would be my Primary doctor and would deliver the baby (she's a really renowned doctor from the University of Washington). I am homozygous for the C677T MTHFR gene mutation and I will tell you that did not impress her one bit. As in, she says it's not related to why this happened.

However, on Friday I'm seeing another doctor because I want to be thorough and I want to either hear the same story or hear some alternate possibilities. I'm also reconsidering doing the genetic test, just to have maximum information in front of us. 

Does anyone have any advice or questions to ask this other doctor or my current one? Does anyone have experience with a similar story? 

UPDATE: the doctor was great. She mostly agreed with the others, but felt (as did I) that doing the bloodwork was prudent. So we are awaiting results. If something comes back positive, I may also add low dose heparin to my plan. Otherwise, just baby aspirin and a lot more monitoring. ",t2_mp6ab,False,,0,False,Getting a third opinion on Friday.
