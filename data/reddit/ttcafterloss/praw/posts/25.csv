I'm currently experiencing my 2nd CP and I knew that it was going to be a CP the very minute the first Wondfo showed a shadow of a line. Why did I know that? I don't think it was a gut instinct. It was not a defense mechanism. I think that I had taken in so much information from the internet, from tracking and charting, and discussions on this sub, that I just *knew* the odds were not in my favor.  As more and more information came in, I just put it all together and was able to come to a reasonable conclusion about what was likely to happen. What I've been wondering for days, and actually for most of the past year, is if being armed with knowledge and technology through the TTC process is more good than bad or more bad than good. I would absolutely love to hear others' thoughts on this. 

Ever since beginning the TTC journey, I've been simultaneously grateful for and resentful of trying to conceive in the information and technology age. How wonderful to have in-depth knowledge of our own bodies and cycles. We don't have to wholly rely on doctors who boil everything down to the ""average"" woman, that we all know does not exist. How lucky we are to be able to all come together and post our fears, challenges, worries, celebrations, charts, BFPs, BFNs, CM, DPO and CD numbers and get feedback and reassurance from like-minded, well-informed people. This was not done or even discussed when my mom was trying to become pregnant with me. It's really amazing. We can arm ourselves with knowledge that can help us advocate for ourselves. But why do I feel bad about it? I cannot help but feel like I might be better off being completely in the dark. Would I have been better off thinking this CP was a heavy period? Part of me says no, because now I have specific information about my fertility that I can use to see if intervention is necessary to have a successful pregnancy. Without this information, I might continue having difficulty getting pregnant. On the other hand, the ups and downs and anxiety my mind and body have experienced in the last week are tremendous. From as benign as hours of obsessive googling to a full blown panic attack where I could not breathe. All because I had the ability to test early and demand betas be drawn. And because I've read enough about this that I knew what all of the information meant. I knew not to have any hope because light lines for days rarely result in good news. Betas of 21 at 14dpo are not promising. I turned three different brands positive but not a digital, so I knew the exact range my betas were going to fall in before I even went to the doctor. I knew everything, but I don't know if I'm better off. 

Is all of this knowledge necessary? Is it helpful? I've chatted with older women about this who love to tell me I am being crazy...""Honey, back in our day, we knew we were pregnant because our boobs would get big and we didn't have a period for 3 months"" and ""We didn't even know when we had miscarriages. We would get a really late period with a lot of clots and say 'oh well, guess it was a false pregnancy!'"" ""You young girls are just crazy...who needs a test that tells you 6 days sooner....just relax and it will happen!"" Were they better off? Are we better off? I'm sure the answer is both yes and no. But now that we have the information we do, can we ever go back to being ignorant to it? Maybe it's more about self-control, which I have none of. Yes, we know we can test early, google incessantly, and try to hurry fate along, but we don't HAVE to. We can make the choice to be patient, accept that nature is going to take its course either way, and we really do have very little control. That's a tough pill to swallow, and a lesson I guess I'm going to have to learn. I imagine that once pregnancy is firmly established, the desire to predict whether or not a healthy baby is going to come home with you is even stronger than waiting for BFPs and early betas. 

I sent my friend who has known me since 7th grade a photo of my tests and their labels. She said ""After June 22nd the line basically disappeared. You have always been a nerd"" and it made me so happy. I told her I appreciated being viewed as a nerd because I've just felt like people think I'm nuts. And she said ""I've never thought it was crazy, just nerdy and geeky and of course you would be your own midwife."" I think t's important to stop feeling shame for going ""all in"" with this process and accept that it was always going to be that way because it's who I am. I am a researcher for a living, how would I *not* research TTC? Perhaps the key to surviving TTC and pregnancy is striking a balance between finding credible information, advocating for ourselves, and then somehow finding peace with the fact that we must relinquish control of the outcome. If anyone has been able to successfully do this, first of all, my hat is off to you.

8,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I have obviously been down since the MC that occurred naturally two weeks ago. Stuck in the time where I can't do anything but wait for the next step to begin. It also didn't help that we haven't been able to have sex since the MC so we don't get to feel that closeness that we could really use to help grieve.


Well yesterday was my two-week postpartum appointment and I got the awesome news that we could start having sex again. Best of all it can be unprotected because she gave the OK to start trying again right away without waiting for a period which I am super thankful for. I have read so many differing things about when to start and the midwife was just like ""Yeah it's basically just for dating purposes and makes no difference on the baby if you conceive"". So so happy about that because we really don't want to wait.


Feel much better because we finally got to have some sex and then I just got a call this morning that my HCG is less than 1! That was really the main thing I was worried about because I'm nervous the MC is going to mess up my hormones and make my cycles all wonky.

Stuck in the time where I can&#39;t do anything but wait for the next step to begin. It also didn&#39;t help that we haven&#39;t been able to have sex since the MC so we don&#39;t get to feel that closeness that we could really use to help grieve.</p>

<p>Well yesterday was my two-week postpartum appointment and I got the awesome news that we could start having sex again. Best of all it can be unprotected because she gave the OK to start trying again right away without waiting for a period which I am super thankful for. I have read so many differing things about when to start and the midwife was just like &quot;Yeah it&#39;s basically just for dating purposes and makes no difference on the baby if you conceive&quot;. So so happy about that because we really don&#39;t want to wait.</p>

<p>Feel much better because we finally got to have some sex and then I just got a call this morning that my HCG is less than 1! That was really the main thing I was worried about because I&#39;m nervous the MC is going to mess up my hormones and make my cycles all wonky. Now with no HCG I feel a little better that everything will start working up to ovulation. The only thing that could make today any better would be some EWCM and a positive OPK!</p>

20,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone, not sure if I really belong here yet because I can't TTC until I miscarry or do the D&C (both of which terrify me), but I've been hanging out while waiting for things to move along and reading everyone's stories, and it's been helping. Anyways, 2 weeks ago I was told I probably had a blighted ovum. I was supposed to be 8.5 weeks by LMP, 7.5 weeks by when I thought I ovulated, and just had an empty sack measuring 6.5 weeks. I cried before the doctor even told me because I knew the ultrasound tech would have shown my husband and I the baby and the heartbeat if there was one. I had blood work done that day and 2 days later and my HCG went from 17600-18800, so my body was not taking the hint if there was no baby, or my doctor said maybe there was a baby and I would need another ultrasound in 2 weeks. I didn't think that was possible though because of when I found out I was pregnant I had to be at least 7.5 weeks.

So today I got another internal ultrasound (wear a summer dress to those if you can, I found it made it a little less awkward because I was basically dressed when she was done), and it was obvious there was no baby. The office has a big TV screen you watch with the ultrasound, so it's not something they hide from you. I was really curious if things had changed from last time and if it looked like my body was realizing there's no baby. But she wouldn't tell me anything and said the doctor would go over it all with me. So I finish and ask when I can see the doctor to go over things, and they have to make me an appointment and were surprised I didn't already have one. Uhh they set this up for me! Now I have to go back tomorrow at 1:30. I've already missed so much work for this non-existent baby and spent so much time barfing in sinks and toilets I am just very over this whole thing right now. It's just frustrating the ultrasound techs can't explain anything to you if it's not showing you a healthy baby :( You can stick a slimy dildo wand up inside me but can't explain what I have to look at for 15 minutes while you do so!?

If anyone is still with me, say my body is recognizing the lack of baby finally, and I naturally miscarry, does anyone know the chances of having to have a D&C anyways? I am seriously terrified of both options, more the D&C than the natural MC, but getting stuck having both of those things sounds the absolute worst in these 2 already terrible options. Does one over the other let me TTC sooner? Ive been reading stories of both online and I just cry so much it's so hard! I hate that this happens to so many women and no one ever talks about it in person. I also hate that I had absolutely no idea pre-TTC that this could happen. I used to think you either had a baby or a miscarriage, I never knew your body could stay ""pregnant"" with no baby for weeks on end and possibly require medical intervention to stop being pregnant. Everyone said being so sick was a good sign of a strong baby... When we told our family they couldn't believe it, and I almost felt like they thought I was faking being sick. 

Pretty sure I'm way off topic for my rant at this point....

Anyways, 2 weeks ago I was told I probably had a blighted ovum. I was supposed to be 8.5 weeks by LMP, 7.5 weeks by when I thought I ovulated, and just had an empty sack measuring 6.5 weeks. I cried before the doctor even told me because I knew the ultrasound tech would have shown my husband and I the baby and the heartbeat if there was one. I had blood work done that day and 2 days later and my HCG went from 17600-18800, so my body was not taking the hint if there was no baby, or my doctor said maybe there was a baby and I would need another ultrasound in 2 weeks. I didn&#39;t think that was possible though because of when I found out I was pregnant I had to be at least 7.5 weeks.</p>

<p>So today I got another internal ultrasound (wear a summer dress to those if you can, I found it made it a little less awkward because I was basically dressed when she was done), and it was obvious there was no baby. The office has a big TV screen you watch with the ultrasound, so it&#39;s not something they hide from you. I was really curious if things had changed from last time and if it looked like my body was realizing there&#39;s no baby. But she wouldn&#39;t tell me anything and said the doctor would go over it all with me. So I finish and ask when I can see the doctor to go over things, and they have to make me an appointment and were surprised I didn&#39;t already have one. Uhh they set this up for me! Now I have to go back tomorrow at 1:30. I&#39;ve already missed so much work for this non-existent baby and spent so much time barfing in sinks and toilets I am just very over this whole thing right now. It&#39;s just frustrating the ultrasound techs can&#39;t explain anything to you if it&#39;s not showing you a healthy baby :( You can stick a slimy dildo wand up inside me but can&#39;t explain what I have to look at for 15 minutes while you do so!?</p>

<p>If anyone is still with me, say my body is recognizing the lack of baby finally, and I naturally miscarry, does anyone know the chances of having to have a D&amp;C anyways? I am seriously terrified of both options, more the D&amp;C than the natural MC, but getting stuck having both of those things sounds the absolute worst in these 2 already terrible options. Does one over the other let me TTC sooner? Ive been reading stories of both online and I just cry so much it&#39;s so hard! I hate that this happens to so many women and no one ever talks about it in person. I also hate that I had absolutely no idea pre-TTC that this could happen. I used to think you either had a baby or a miscarriage, I never knew your body could stay &quot;pregnant&quot; with no baby for weeks on end and possibly require medical intervention to stop being pregnant. Everyone said being so sick was a good sign of a strong baby... When we told our family they couldn&#39;t believe it, and I almost felt like they thought I was faking being sick. </p>

<p>Pretty sure I&#39;m way off topic for my rant at this point.... Any advice for what to do with either natural MC, D&amp;C or maybe even the pills (ahh also scary!) would be greatly appreciated and I hope I can start TTC again soon!</p>

I'm 33 and my husband and I just started trying for our first baby. I was overjoyed to get two positive home pregnancy tests five weeks ago and then get my blood test confirmed at the OB. I was also immediately nervous, but chalked it up to being an anxious person and the fact that this happened so fast (I assumed we'd have to try for months). As the weeks went by and I felt nearly every pregnancy symptom (morning sickness, dizziness, breast pain so terrible I had to do straight-up yoga breathing every time I took off my bra), I relaxed a little: everyone says all those symptoms are good news, that they mean the pregnancy is progressing as it should. 

On Thursday, we went in for our first real OB appointment, excited to hopefully see a baby with a heartbeat. When my (amazing) doctor did the ultrasound, however...nothing. My uterus was empty. My doctor explained that this was a blighted ovum - the embryo had likely had a chromosomal abnormality and may have never even implanted. My body, however, still thought I was pregnant and kept going on with all the hormonal changes - basically, everything went beautifully with this pregnancy, except for the fact that, you know, there's no baby. 

I went in the next day for a D&C. I chose to do it with local anesthetic since I would have had to wait longer to schedule one to go under and as soon as I knew, I just wanted it all gone. Now, though, I keep thinking about all the blood and feeling devastated and scared all over again.

I know it's only been two days and it's okay that I feel completely gutted. I know that the odds are good that I'll be able to conceive again and soon and that my next pregnancy will be healthy.

Hey guys, new here though like everyone I would rather not be. As an intro I am currently 33 and have a 21 month old. My husband and I decided to start trying to give our son a sibling when I hit the 18 month postpartum mark as I have heard that is when your uterus is fully healed and we always knew we wanted at least 2. We decided to start out NTNP but as I was keeping track of ovulation for knowing when my period would start I made sure we had plenty of sex around ovulation. Imagine my surprise when I found out I was pregnant on the first try! It took 5 cycles to conceive #1 so I was super happy to have it happen so quickly this time around.

We find out and at 5 weeks we tell immediate family because I had no worry at all that a miscarriage was even possible. Why would it be when all I have is experience getting pregnant and then everything going smoothly. I do all the newely pregnant stuff: start looking into new things to make having a newborn easier the second time around, get a pregnancy journal, start taking weekly bump pictures, make my 8 week midwife appointment.

Everything seemed like last time except I had basically no symptoms. I had some heartburn around week 5 and sore breasts up until week 6 but had no nausea and the sore breasts stopped at week 6. In my nothing could possibly be wrong mentality I just wrote off the no symptoms as being one of the lucky few. I did have an inkling in the back of my mind that something seemed off though because of the lack of symptoms. With #1 I had horrible nausea all day every day from week 6 until like week 15. I also noticed that my wondfo progression lines were staying the same color and not really darkening between 11dpo and 17dpo. I mean they got darker but not a lot and now that I look back at the progression pics I think it looks like a red flag. I thought that was just sometimes what happened and brushed it off. Stopped taking a test every day and eventual the line was as dark as the control so whatever right?

At 7+4 I started having some spotting. The same thing happened with #1 around 11 weeks so I thought maybe it was normal. Then I noticed that there was brown blood every time I wiped whereas with #1 it only happened once. Because of this and because I am RH negative I decided to go to the ER if anything just to get a rhogam shot and because I wouldn't mind an US to tell me how everything looks. After a 6 hour ER trip with trans-vaginal US I'm told by the ER doc that ""I have good news!"" he said there was a strong heart beat but the baby was measuring smaller than it should but that was probably because I was a week or two off when I ovulated. I thought this was weird because I knew exactly when I ovulated due to charting but thought I guess I could be a couple days off.

Queue the next couple days I start spotting more. We go to the midwifes office and discuss that it may be OK but may also be an MC because even though the ER doc thought everything was good because of the heartbeat my midwife thought differently because of the sac. The ER doc told me the baby was measuring small but the actual problem was that the sac was measuring at 5+6 and the baby was measuring at 6+6 even though I was supposed to be at 7+4. Because the sac was measuring small the midwife wasn't as optimistic ER doc but she wanted me to just stick with my US and HCG appointments I have scheduled in the next day and that probably it would be OK.

The next day I was full on period bleeding and had little hope that everything was going to be OK. I skip the HCG appointment because I'm pretty sure the baby is gone and just go to the US appointment to verify. We have the US and the tech tells me there is no baby and only the sac is left. I don't even know when I passed the baby so that makes me kinda sad. The US doc lets me know since I'm still bleeding and have already passed the baby that I can just have a natural MC and to follow up with my midwife.

Over the next 7 days I continue to bleed with one day of what I can only describe as mild labor contractions because they hurt worse than normal period cramps. I believe I passed the sac that day but don't know as I was having large clots come out at multiple times. Finally the bleeding stops and I'm happy it's over but still pretty depressed that we lost the baby. Also super depressed that we should wait until my next period before we start trying again.

Currently at almost 2 weeks past and I think I just feel numb about it. I'm having all this anxiety like what if now my cycles are messed up and it takes forever to get pregnant again? Or while at the ER I was told not by the doctor but on the follow up sheet that I had a cyst on each ovary. No one who read my ultrasound said anything about that but is that a problem? I have read that it's normal after ovulation but is one on each ovary normal? What if I do get pregnant again and I have another MC? I don't know if I can handle that :( I don't know if my husband could handle it either especially since he is taking this MC harder than me. Now I feel like my TTC journey for #2 is tainted and I can't have the fun or carefree air that we had with #1 or with this one. I just feel numb and depressed when I think about it. Pretty much try to not think about it at all.

Sigh. Thanks for reading this long ass post lol.

We go to the midwifes office and discuss that it may be OK but may also be an MC because even though the ER doc thought everything was good because of the heartbeat my midwife thought differently because of the sac. The ER doc told me the baby was measuring small but the actual problem was that the sac was measuring at 5+6 and the baby was measuring at 6+6 even though I was supposed to be at 7+4. Because the sac was measuring small the midwife wasn&#39;t as optimistic ER doc but she wanted me to just stick with my US and HCG appointments I have scheduled in the next day and that probably it would be OK.</p>

<p>The next day I was full on period bleeding and had little hope that everything was going to be OK. I skip the HCG appointment because I&#39;m pretty sure the baby is gone and just go to the US appointment to verify. We have the US and the tech tells me there is no baby and only the sac is left. I don&#39;t even know when I passed the baby so that makes me kinda sad. The US doc lets me know since I&#39;m still bleeding and have already passed the baby that I can just have a natural MC and to follow up with my midwife.</p>

<p>Over the next 7 days I continue to bleed with one day of what I can only describe as mild labor contractions because they hurt worse than normal period cramps. I believe I passed the sac that day but don&#39;t know as I was having large clots come out at multiple times. Finally the bleeding stops and I&#39;m happy it&#39;s over but still pretty depressed that we lost the baby. Also super depressed that we should wait until my next period before we start trying again.</p>

<p>Currently at almost 2 weeks past and I think I just feel numb about it. I&#39;m having all this anxiety like what if now my cycles are messed up and it takes forever to get pregnant again? Or while at the ER I was told not by the doctor but on the follow up sheet that I had a cyst on each ovary. No one who read my ultrasound said anything about that but is that a problem? I have read that it&#39;s normal after ovulation but is one on each ovary normal? What if I do get pregnant again and I have another MC? I don&#39;t know if I can handle that :( I don&#39;t know if my husband could handle it either especially since he is taking this MC harder than me. Now I feel like my TTC journey for #2 is tainted and I can&#39;t have the fun or carefree air that we had with #1 or with this one. I just feel numb and depressed when I think about it. Pretty much try to not think about it at all.</p>

<p>Sigh. Thanks for reading this long ass post lol.</p>

Anyways, I miscarried about 1.5 weeks ago, and did Misoprostol last Thursday. It wasn't as bad as I thought, to be honest, but I'm sure the pain pills they gave me helped. I was bleeding, which then pretty much stopped on Wednesday. I went in for a follow-up yesterday (had to wait an hour to see the stupid NP!) and she had me take a third blood test. She just called and said my levels were still not back to normal, and that I needed to go back in a week to get another blood test. She didn't tell me my levels either, so I don't know how much I dropped since last week. (Another annoyance, so I think I might switch to someone else because she seems really scatterbrained.) 

Anyways, are continuous blood tests worth it? It takes time, costs me money and of course just another reminder of my miscarriage. At this point I just want to move on and get back to normal. How long did it take for your hormone levels to get back to normal? 

Edit: Just heard back actually, my levels are at 219, and it was 417 last week. So def a steady decline. They also said just protected sex for now, which kinda sucks lol.

TFMR is not an easy decision, t21 or otherwise, I hope none of you ever have to know what it's like because it's not like a miscarriage. It's not 'just Downs Syndrome' it's years of surgeries, if the baby survives that long in utero, it's bowels that don't work, hearts with three chambers and holes in the skull, then if they survive all that as a baby, cue more surgeries, a life of rejection and social isolation with people dictating your every move. Tell me which of you would wish that life on a child of yours? My husband and I chose to suffer for the rest of our lives so that our child wouldn't have to suffer for one minute of it.

My husband (30) and I (29) had been trying for four months when we got our BFP in December. We were so excited and told our families who were overjoyed with the news. I am the oldest grandchild on my side so our little one was to be the first baby in about 15 years in our family. Even my dad who has never shown much emotion was overcome with happy tears. This all ended about 4 weeks later (at around 10 weeks). My husband and I had travelled to Costa Rica as chaperones for a study tour with twenty students. This trip had been planned for months and my doctor ok'ed the travel. Things were great- we swam and hiked (moderately) and had a great time with the students until the last night when I started bleeding. We ran to the front desk to call a cab to rush us to the ER where no one could understand us because we don't speak Spanish. Using a translation book we eventually got the point across and they brought me in for an ultrasound.

A few hours later the obgyn was called in and a D&C was ordered.

I can still remember how cold it was in the room and how I couldn't stop shivering. After the operation we were free to go, but the next day was not easy. I had to put on my happy face and fly the 8 hours home with my students. Needless to say it was a painful day that I find myself constantly reliving in my head.
Since then we have been ttc but with no luck. My doctor wants me to stay positive, but that is easier said than done-- it just feels like this will never happen!

58,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello, I'm 31 and just had a miscarriage at about 7 weeks. I went off the pill back in November, and my husband and I were NTNP since then. He was kinda freaked out about kids, so we both figured instead of putting pressure on ourselves to get pregnant, we would just let nature take it's course. 

I got a BFP on May 22, after my period was a few days late. (I have had cycles anywhere from 28-32 days long.) I was out of town at the time, and had to wait to fly home to tell my husband. After the initial shock, he was so excited and happy, it seems to just flip a switch on his thoughts on having a child. 

Anyways, I started noticing very, very light amounts of blood when using the bathroom at about 5w5d. Then it got a little worse and worse over a couple of days. I kept speaking with my doctor and my nurse practitioner, and they had a ""wait and see"" attitude. I then started to have pretty bad cramps with more red blood, and I knew that was a pretty bad sign.  I went in for an appointment at 6w5d, and all they could see on the scan was a sac. She had me draw blood for a hormone test, then had to wait 2 days for a comparison. Shittiest two days of my life!! That has seriously been the worst part of this whole situation, just waiting to know what was going on. 

Got the results back, and my hormone level had decreased so the miscarriage was confirmed. Went back in for my ""7 week"" appointment"", which had then turned into the miscarriage follow-up. The damn nurse who was taking my BP told me ""Congratulations!"" and I had to correct her, so extremely awkward. 

My NP gave me the option of Misoprostol, which I decided to go with. I started those on Thursday, and the does was complete on Friday.

I went off the pill back in November, and my husband and I were NTNP since then. He was kinda freaked out about kids, so we both figured instead of putting pressure on ourselves to get pregnant, we would just let nature take it&#39;s course. </p>

<p>I got a BFP on May 22, after my period was a few days late. (I have had cycles anywhere from 28-32 days long.) I was out of town at the time, and had to wait to fly home to tell my husband. After the initial shock, he was so excited and happy, it seems to just flip a switch on his thoughts on having a child. </p>

<p>Anyways, I started noticing very, very light amounts of blood when using the bathroom at about 5w5d. Then it got a little worse and worse over a couple of days. I kept speaking with my doctor and my nurse practitioner, and they had a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude. I then started to have pretty bad cramps with more red blood, and I knew that was a pretty bad sign.  I went in for an appointment at 6w5d, and all they could see on the scan was a sac. She had me draw blood for a hormone test, then had to wait 2 days for a comparison. Shittiest two days of my life!! That has seriously been the worst part of this whole situation, just waiting to know what was going on. </p>

<p>Got the results back, and my hormone level had decreased so the miscarriage was confirmed. Went back in for my &quot;7 week&quot; appointment&quot;, which had then turned into the miscarriage follow-up. The damn nurse who was taking my BP told me &quot;Congratulations!&quot; and I had to correct her, so extremely awkward. </p>

<p>My NP gave me the option of Misoprostol, which I decided to go with. I started those on Thursday, and the does was complete on Friday. Luckily I took those days off, and then had the whole weekend to recover. It really wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought, just some cramping and bleeding like a heavy period.

Apologies in advance for the long post, my head is all over the place right now. So, my husband and I are both 35 and have been trying to conceive our second child for the last 18 months. I got pregnant with our 5 year old without any problems (ntnp) and it was an uneventful pregnancy. Perfectly healthy child. 
Fast forward to last September; finally got a positive test! So excited! I never anticipated anything going wrong, which was so naive. Dr gave me the option of doing the quad screen at 15-16 weeks, and I did it not expecting anything out of the ordinary. When the nurse called with the results, positive for T21, I was able to talk myself down knowing that test wasn't hugely accurate. I didn't ask for the numbers. I'm glad I didn't. 1:10. Right before Christmas. So they scheduled the materniT21 test the next day. Results came in just before the new year; it's a boy and still positive. Everything I thought I knew was gone in an instant. We tried to stay hopeful, as we waited out the week for our amnio and ultrasound with the MFM. We went back and forth over what we would do, but my husband insisted that it was ultimately up to me because it's my body. I was still clinging to a little bit of hope the morning of the amnio. Maybe he would be ok physically, maybe the tests were wrong, maybe... As soon as the dr started going over everything she was seeing that little bit of hope was destroyed. There was no way this child would ever have anything resembling a normal life. If he even made it to birth we were looking at multiple life saving surgeries and so much pain and suffering. I just couldn't do that to him, or to the child we already have at home. I was 19 weeks at this point, and had already been feeling him move. I wanted to wait until we had the amnio results before we did anything because I just wanted more time with him. Truthfully, I also spent the week and a half before the D&amp;E apologizing to him and praying I would miscarry so I didn't have to do this. It seems none of my prayers were ever answered during this pregnancy. Those were the worst two days of my life, but my husband was amazing and I don't think I would have survived this without him. With his help, and lots of therapy I've been doing really well. 
We started trying again in March, and to our surprise we had another positive test a month ago. The same month we should have been bringing home a baby, we found out we were expecting another one. That has to be some sort of sign right? My husband was so excited, but I wasn't letting myself think about it much. I don't feel pregnant at all so it's been easy to just put it out of my mind. We had our first ob appointment last week, I should have been 8 weeks along. I've been temping so I know my dates are accurate. During the ultrasound the tech only found a sac measuring 6 weeks, and no fetal pole. At this point I lost it, and she's trying to reassure me that it's just too early, but like I said I know when I ovulated and there's just know way it's 2 weeks behind. I just don't see how that's physically possible. The dr gave me the same speech, and took blood to check hcg and progesterone, and wants me back this week for another ultrasound and blood work. I'm not hopeful at all, I just can't be. I'm so angry. How is this happening again? Everything I've read says blighted ovums are mostly caused by genetic/chromosomal abnormalities. So the last time was just a fluke. What about this time? Is this a fluke too? How in the hell is that possible? Two times in a row? I just want some damn answers, not more wait and see! I don't even know where to go from here. Is it me? Am I just full of bad eggs now? It feels like I'm playing a game of beat the clock and I'm losing. 
Thanks for reading the rambling mess, sorry about the length. I'm just so confused and angry right now. 


Update- Started spotting Tuesday, saw the dr Wednesday and there was no change. Miscarriage confirmed; dr said I could wait it out, take a pill, or they could do a d&c. My body made the decision before I could. Luckily they sent me home with a script for painkillers, because yesterday was pretty awful.

I'm a 32 y/o mother of one (2 y/o daughter). It took four cycles to conceive my daughter. The pregnancy was a bit rough; I had gestational diabetes and high blood pressure and had to be induced three weeks early. Thankfully, my daughter is healthy and amazing.

I started TTC baby #2 in December 2015. I got a BFP at the beginning of April. I kept waiting to feel pregnancy symptoms; I had really bad nausea and frequent vomiting with my first, but as the weeks went on, I had no symptoms other than breast tenderness/fullness. Around 6 weeks I started spotting, went to the ER and was told I was either having a miscarriage or was totally fine. I was monitored for the next 10 days with HCG blood draws every two days. My OB unintentionally kept getting my hopes up because my levels went up, dropped, then went up again. After 10 days, the active miscarriage started and continued for about two weeks. The diagnosis was a blighted ovum; a sac was visible, but nothing else. My OB said I should wait three months before TTC. It has been about two months and I plan to start trying in July. 

I'm very nervous because the experience was emotionally hard on me though I tried to rationalize it to myself. I reached out for support to my MIL (who has had miscarriages) and my mother and received ""It's no big deal, you weren't far along"" from both of them.

Please be cautious with yourself, if I read my story while I was pregnant or TTC I would have been terrified/horrified but everything that happened to me was extremely rare. I'm just looking for those who have similar experiences and I have some questions about moving forward with future pregnancies.

Here it is, as briefly as possible: I had a completely normal pregnancy until my daughter was found to have a choroid plexus cyst and echogenic bowel at the 20 wk anatomy scan. We were re-scanned at 26 weeks, and those things were both completely resolved, but she had a small amount of fluid around her lung. We were re-scanned every week and it worsened every time, and eventually she had fluid accumulating everywhere. We tested for everything (genetic conditions and viral syndromes), did an amnio and chromosomal microarray, and it was all negative/normal. We made a plan for delivery at 32 weeks with the neonatologist, MFM, and my regular OB but I had polyhydramnios and my water broke and I went into labor at only 30 weeks. They were still able to do the special procedure we had planned to drain her lungs before birth, followed by a classical (vertical) C-section to give her the best chance possible. She lived for 22 days in the NICU before contracting NEC and passing away in my arms. The final diagnosis was congenital chylothorax, which is extremely rare and not likely to reoccur in subsequent pregnancies. 

I know for sure that I want more children. My daughter was my only pregnancy and we feel devastated that in addition to losing her beautiful spirit, we still have no children with us. She is, of course, irreplaceable and will always be my first baby, but we both feel that having a living child is something we desperately want. My OB told me to wait 6 months before TTC for my uterine incision to heal and for us to mourn our daughter. I guess I should use birth control during this time? I want to have the best chance at a healthy pregnancy in the future, but we both hate condoms.. I was thinking of asking for the pill at my 6 week postpartum appointment but I don't want to delay pregnancy at the end of the 6 months for adjustment time.
