After about two weeks of sadness-induced comfort eating, I decided to turn to a healthy diet and lots of exercise to try to workout some of my pain, since my initial reaction was making me feel even worse. I’ve been taking really great physical care of myself for the past 5 weeks or so.

But in the past 2 weeks, despite all of that, I have started to experience extreme fatigue, and am feeling really emotional, occasionally partnered with mild nausea. (I’m definitely not pregnant again.) I’m getting good sleep, good hydration, etc.

Has anyone else experienced this in the month or two following their MC? I am wondering if this is some kind of hormone crash that is leaving me feeling this way. It also seems like it could be unprocessed grief.

Anyway, it might just be me - I am going to the doc on Wednesday to get a blood panel drawn for my peace of mind, but would definitely feel better if this wasn’t super weird...

She has a genetic bone disorder and we needed clearance from a specialist before we could even consider her carrying a child. We both want children and weren’t new to discussing it and dreaming about our future family. All we had was positivity. It wasn’t unusual for women in her family to have unusual cycles and it was becoming more and more difficult to track the more we tried. Her stress was through the roof and it hurt me a lot to see her struggle. So we decided to stop trying and just let life happen for a little while.

About 3 weeks ago, she called me into the bedroom. Holding three tests, all with 2 pink lines, and tears in her eyes, i can honestly say I’ve never felt happier! Immediately, our lives seemed to have purpose. We felt more complete. And even though she was barely 5 weeks along, we couldn’t help but start planning. 

I’m a craftsman so I started building a crib and other things that we would need for a baby. After the first ultrasound, we sat in the car for 2 hours looking at paint schemes on Pinterest for a nursery. In. Love.

She’s been going to the doctor a couple times a week to try to catch complications before they become huge issues and it has been a rough 3 weeks trying to keep everything straight. 2 days ago, I was allowed to go into the office (which was against the rules because of covid) and be with her during an ultrasound. The baby had grown since the last one. Measuring right on schedule. She was getting the faint beginning of a bump (probably mostly in our heads but still). I wasn’t ready for it. Neither of us were. No heartbeat. We both seemed to keep it together until he left the room to give us a minute. Then the wailing began. 

It was a long ride home. Silent. And yet it felt like someone was screaming in my ear. We cried all night. We both went to work yesterday. She was able to keep her mind busy. I was not. I was working alone and not particularly busy. I broke down in tears a lot over small things. 

Now this is where I don’t know what to do. My wife has seemed to accept things quickly. It’s not easy for her by any means. But she’s a woman. and a strong one at that. I know that I need to support her. After all, I don’t have a baby inside of me. I don’t have to deal with any of the physical or emotional pain that comes with having a lifeless being inside of me. I need to be the one supporting her. But instead, I feel like she has been consoling me. My emotions have never been an issue for me. But it seems like the loss of our baby is too much to keep in. I don’t want to cry anymore. I don’t want to be angry anymore. I only want to support my wife and let her grieve. I want to be her rock when she needs one. I need to be the strong man she married. Idk what to do right now.

I'll share my story and what I've figured out so far.

I have 1LC and had a D&C after for retained placenta. I had a pregnancy last year that was complicated by a subchorionic hemorrhage and ended at 19 weeks. The miscarriage was incomplete so I went for a D&C the following week. I had 2 days of SEVERE, sharp uterine pain after my surgery which has always worried me the doc was too aggressive. I ended up with a fever and heavy bleeding/clots 1 week after surgery requiring antibiotics and cytotec to expel the clots. Following all of this I resumed semi ""normal"" cycles. They are short. I ovulate around day 10 which is early and abnormal for me (usually day 17). My luteal phase is about 12 days. I have been trying to concieve for 10 months now with no luck, and 2 chemical pregnancies. What I have figured out is that my lining sits at around 5mm total, thin stripe and no trilaminar pattern. It does not thicken past that, and doesn't really shed. My periods consist of 1-2 days small dark brown spotting/small clots (never any red blood).

I already ovulate on my own, but my new OB tried me on clomid x2 cycles and letrozole x1 cycle due to having a low 21 day progesterone in hopes that giving me a ""stronger ovulation"" would help my hormones thicken my lining. I've also been on progesterone during my luteal phase. I had a chemical with the letrozole cycle (as well as a cycle with no meds) but in all cycles my lining never grew past 5mm and stayed a thin stripe. The other weird thing is I always have a fluid that shows up in my uterus around the time of ovulation that is still unexplained.

I take a baby Aspirin daily, along with a prenatal, vitamin E, and folic acid supplement. I've tried all the herbal remedies as well. I just had a hysteroscopy a few days ago that I demanded as I fear my lining was scraped too deeply. No signs of inflammation, scarring, adhesions, or any other abnormalities other than a very thin lining (I also happened to be ovulating the day of the procedure).

I on the other hand feel like there’s nothing left of me, I am a mess and have lost motivation to even try to build up a career (I’m an RN and quite happy to stay that way for a baby). Now my husband is saying that if we try again immediately and it ends up in a miscarriage he wouldn’t be able to take it as he was so exhausted from the whole pregnancy and miscarriage, not sure if it’s because I relied on him so much. I personally think he’s not ready to have a child as of yet cause he just wants to focus on his students and work. I’m not sure what to do now. I can’t force him to try again but I’m dying inside knowing that I can’t have my dream baby anytime soon.</p>

This question is specifically for those ladies who miscarried their 1st pregnancy (aka hadn’t been through body changes from other pregnancies). My weight pre-pregnancy was very consistent for the last 2 or so years (I’d never gone above 124 lbs and was blessed to be able to eat a lot and not gain much weight). I work out pretty consistently and eat very healthy too most of the time. During my pregnancy I was gaining the recommended amount of weight per week and kept working out/eating healthy (as much as I could muster). After my miscarriage, I thought my body would bounce back to before but it feels like this last ~1.5lbs doesn’t want to leave!! Anyone else experiencing this?

I hope this is an OK question. I'm new to this group and new to the loss community so forgive me if I get anything wrong. I'm also sorry this is so long.

Tldr: I am looking for wisdom as I  try to decide between waiting to certainly miscarry or TFMR.

I am 8 +4 weeks along in my second pregnancy after 15 cycles of trying. I had my first appointment and ultrasound a few weeks ago and things seemed fine. I went for a followup ultrasound today and my OBGYN told me they saw fluid buildup in the chest of the fetus. They immediately sent me to MFM at a local hospital and I had another ultrasound with the head of their department. He was pretty straightforward that there was definitely an abnormality with the fluid in the chest but it also appeared that the heart wasn't developing where it was supposed to. He said that while it is too early to tell, he'd guess that if these two abnormalities are clearly visible this early there is a strong possibility that there will be additional genetic problems. We were told in the kindest way that this pregnancy will not be viable- we can wait to naturally miscarry or schedule a termination. 

Here's where I need advice. They said we can wait 2 weeks to have another scan to get a better ultrasound and do the CVS and NIPT testing so we can get a better grasp of the genetic defects. There was no suggestion that this would in any way save the pregnancy and there's no guarantee that the fetus will make it that far. It is simply to get answers but I'm not sure we are interested in drawing this out. I am wrestling with just allowing this to end naturally or scheduling a termination. I am dreading the waiting until I miscarry. I'm afraid of the physical pain and the emotional toll it may take since we don't know when it could happen. I am also a bit worried about scheduling a termination but I can't put into words why.  I was warned about the possible scarring from the procedure which gives me pause. I do appreciate the idea that it would just be done and gives me some control.. Also, they can get a tissue sample during the procedure and do genetic testing that way so we get the same answers as we would if we got the ultrasound and CVS in a few weeks.

At that time, my husband and I just got married for 2 months, and we kinda jokingly talked about trying, and then it happened. The first time I had the ultrasound was around 7 weeks, and we saw the sac and heard the heartbeat, but the heartbeat was slow around 90 bpm. I started having brown spotting a week later and called the doctor. They asked me to come in for another ultrasound and so I did. However, at that time they couldn’t find a heartbeat anymore. I vividly remember because it was so hard to find appointments with the doctor or do ultrasound, they had to squeeze me in with the radiology department. The doctor that talked to me was a urologist. I remember thinking who is this person, and why is she telling me all of this. When I came home, my husband and I were in shock and we honestly didn't know how to react. Then the nurse from my doctor called, and she started talking to me about options to abort this pregnancy and that was when it hit me. My husband and I cried that night. I eventually chose to do a DNC because it just won’t pass by itself. During the DNC, the doctors were super nice and sympathetic. After the procedure, I was actually in pain, and all i wanted to do was to just rest for a bit, but the nurse kept coming in to kick us out. I just remember that we left feeling so broken. Last year was really difficult for me. I took a break after this. I was fortunate that my company allowed me to take parental leave for this, so I took a month off. Throughout the year, my husband and I travelled a lot, trying to heal from everything. I think time does do a lot of the healing, tho it's been more than a year, I still feel sad and depressed about it sometimes. This is the first time I really talked about this to people other than my husband and my parents. I know I will feel better the more I talk about it to people, but I can never bring myself to do it. I tried telling my close friends, but they are either not married or just got married, and having babies aren't really on top of their mind let alone miscarriages. None of them understands. One of my friend actually told me that I'm lucky to get my life back because I don't have to worry about the baby, and another one just ignored my texts when I texted her that it's so hard for me. I know it's really hard to be empathetic when you haven't gone through it yourself, but I do feel so alone in this because none of my girlfriends understand what I'm going through. I'm glad I found this group, because I feel like i can talk about what happened comfortably. Just want to share my story, and share some of the stuff I learned after this. If you can, please do take breaks after you go through such a devastating experience. Also therapy really helps. I've learned a lot about coping with sadness. Lastly, I don't think the sadness or the feeling of loss will ever go away. It might get easier as time goes by. So it's ok to feel sad sometime.

I know that those ppl do not intentionally mean harm but it&#39;s just like.... ok... so should I not be sad and upset I&#39;m not pregnant anymore???? Asking me when we&#39;ll be pregnant again.......I DON&#39;T CONTROL THIS SHIT. Asking me &quot;everything is healthy with u tho right?&quot; regarding if I&#39;m able to have children. I DON&#39;T KNOW, AS THIS WAS MY FIRST MC.</p>

A month ago I got my first positive test after trying with my husband for a really long time. 

About 3 weeks ago I had my first prenatal appointment, and then 3 days later I had some bleeding that was worrying to me, so I went into the E.R. 

They did an emergancy test of my HCG levels, and an emergancy ultrasound, and told me I was 5 weeks, not 8, and that they were worried that maybe the baby stopped growing at that point, but my HCG levels matched to what I would be at, for that timeframe, so she told me to leave there being Cautiously optimistic. The next morning I got a call from my actual doctor, and she told me my ultrasound was consistent with a miscarriage and that they wanted me to come back in 3 days and retest my HCG levels.

I stopped having spotting within those few days and thought maybe it was just a scare. When I got my levels tested again, they went up, but only very slightly, about 17% She told me that it wasn't a large rise which worried her, and told me to come back in a week. 

Last week Wednesday I started bleeding again, it wasn't an extreme amount, but it was more than when I went to ths hospital, almost like a period, and its been on and off since then. I knew what this was, but it wasn't until Monday when I went in and retested that it was confirmed that my levels are now decreasing. 

I'm currently miscarrying. I've been bleeding with miniscule clottting at this point, and I've been having contraction like cramps for a few days now. Everyday it starts at around noon, and its coming in waves. 

I've been on bedrest for about a week now, and I'm just so tired, and in pain. How long does this process last? They want me to come in again in another week and make sure my levels are going down appropriately.

My husband and I both in a lot of pain right now, and this is a really rough thing to go through as a couple, but I'm so thankful that we have each other. I feel selfish for saying it, but I feel like i will be qble to grieve better once my body is done doing what it's doing.

84,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"There it was, that little pink line I have seen 3 times before. The cautious excitement began. It was the night of Friday May 22nd. The line was still very faint so I would test again throughout the weekend and give my doctors office a call on Tuesday because they were closed Memorial Day. The lines got darker throughout the weekend and I upped my vitamin game as I knew I needed more folic acid and vitamin B12 than most due to a gene defect found after my second miscarriage.

Before having my son we had been through two losses. After losing a pregnancy every one after is filled with constant worry and concern. Every ache, pain, or twinge sends a red flag and leaves you wondering, ""am Iosing this one too?"" It is extremely hard to be excited.

I called my OB/GYN that Tuesday and they got me in for a blood test for confirmation that day. I asked about progesterone I was on with my son and it was prescribed again. I began taking it that night. My first ultrasound was scheduled for June 23rd as well as my first visit with my doctor. That weekend I started having intense back pain. I had intense back pain with the first two losses and had a strong feeling something was wrong. It was late Saturday night and the pain was almost unbearable. I had some other signs something was wrong so I called the after hours line. I got a call back from the midwife on call and told her while sobbing I knew something was wrong. She told me to keep taking everything to hold onto the pregnancy and they would check on Monday that she was so sorry I was going through this. Only time would tell if I was losing the baby. On Monday morning I went in and they took blood to check my hormone levels and got me in for a sonogram. My back had stopped hurting. They saw a gestational sac and it was measuring a couple days behind but nothing was too big of a red flag. The hormone, HCG is something that can vary a lot in levels depending on the person so the main test is to measure the change between 48-72 hours apart. I got my Monday results on Tuesday and it was 1,169. On Wednesday my son woke up with an extremely swollen ear and I had to go in to get blood work. I took the day off to get us both to the doctor. I had my blood taken and he was checked out and was determined to just have a strong reaction to mosquitoes.  

Thursday I went back to work and was anxiously awaiting a phone call from the doctor's office. I saw the call pop up on my phone and I rushed out of the office to talk. I heard the shakiness and concern in the nurse's voice. My heart sank and I felt like I got punched in the stomach. I knew what was coming next. My HCG levels only rose to 1,350 in two days. They wanted me to come back the next day for another check but the likelihood this was okay was slim. I called my team leader at work and she brought my stuff out to me so I didn't have to go back into the office crying. I went home. Thursday I went in for another blood test and I spent time with my son at home. I got a call Friday, the level only rose to around 1,500. The doctor wanted me to continue the progesterone to retain the pregnancy so they could do an ultrasound just to really be sure on Monday. It was one of the longest weekends of my life. I tried to stay busy. I went on a jog with my son. We had a social distancing cookout with neighbors. Anything to get endorphins going or to get my mind off of it. I grieved, I cried, and I tried to find appreciation in what I had. 

I didn't sleep well Sunday night so when I woke up I took my son to a friend in the neighborhood's house who is helping with him because his preschool is closed still. I went home and slept some more. My appointments weren't until 4pm so I just tried to stay busy when I woke back up at 11am. I picked my son up at 1pm and spent a little time with him before bringing him to my parents around 2pm. We set up the baby pool at my parents' and he swam. I left for my appointment around 3:30. I had my blood drawn for another HCG check and had the saddest ultrasound of my life. I hadn't made it to the sonograms for the first two. The pregnancy had progressed about 3 days in a week's time.

I met with my doctor and he explained he wanted me to wait over the weekend because he really wanted to be sure since there was grey area with the HCG levels rising. If the HCG levels came back with abnormal results the next morning he would recommend to stop the progesterone that was retaining the pregnancy. I asked him if he had ever seen a pregnancy like this end in success and he said no. I asked a ton of questions and he took plenty of time and answered all of them. We planned the next steps to try and figure this out. 

Tuesday morning I got the expected call and in 4 days my HCG level only went up to around 1,700. At my request they prescribed something to speed along the loss along with some pain management. I couldn't wait any longer with the process and needed help with the physical aspect of it. Instead of being in extreme pain, this time around 11pm I was able to hold my son while he drank a sippy cup of milk after he woke up. I rubbed his head until he went back to sleep. Soon after I put him down the baby passed around 11:30pm on June 9th. It was a gift to be spared the physical torment this time. I wept. I took the next day off work and then went back on Thursday. Near the end of the day Thursday I started crying and went home. Friday I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well, I ended up running a low grade temperature and passed more of the pregnancy. I called the nurse line to see of I should be worried about the temperature and told her I had gone to work the day before, and she exclaimed, ""I thought you were taking the week off!"" I realized I need to be patient with myself and give myself time to recover. 

I'm extremely sad and I know my hormones are amplifying the sorrow. In some ways it is easier this time and in some ways it is harder. This time I know we have been able to have a child. I am so thankful to have him here with us to cheer us up. It is also harder because I now truly know what we lost. We will have tests run and hopefully find answers and a solution.

Coles notes: found out I had a MMC on May 5. Misoprostal on May 10, insane bleeding. Misoprostal round #2 on May 21 after an ultrasound showed a tiny piece of retained tissue. At my last appointment on June 3 my hcg was 98 and the OB said I had passed all the tissue but that I still had a ""very thick lining"", and I could either choose to do round #3 of misoprostal to speed it up or just wait. I decided to wait because I was over the misoprostal situation and wasn't really sure if a 'thick lining' was worth taking it again...

Anyway, fast forward and I got what I assume/hope/pray is my period on June 14 - which sort of makes sense because that's about 5 weeks from the first time I took miso, and 3.5 weeks from the second time...

I usually have super light periods, so I was definitely expecting something heavier than normal since she said I had a ""thick lining"", but instead it's super light, even lighter than my usual - barely there really.

Which brings me to my question - I want to TTC asap but does anyone know if there is any risk to basically not having a full real period and then screwing something up if you do get pregnant?

To paint a picture, we had genetic testing on a twin pregnancy and single pregnancy performed before but both were botched and info was inconclusive.

So, anyway, now... we get the results and learn it was a baby boy (the first time I've learned the sex of the baby) with completely normal chromosomes. Let me just say that I went in thinking 100% that they were going to share that IVF was our only option. (To note: I have NOTHING against IVF, it's just far out of reach for us financially, so this was a small relief). But this doesn't give us much in terms of moving forward - like a real plan. My RE wants to move forward with my current treatment, 400mg of endometrin from 3 days after surge to 10 weeks gestation, as she believes it's the lining of my uterus (I always have normal progesterone values, but apparently a new study shows an issue with cell lining that requires this). Updated to note: I've had full RPL workup by two different REs with nothing more than hypothyroidism, which I'm being treated for, and the uterine lining that may or may not be a cause. 

Anyway, on the one hand, I have hope that it might still happen for us, but then I also feel like we're back to square one, no closer to figuring out why I keep losing, over and over again. It just feels hopeless.

Some days I will have an incredible rush of energy and hope. For example, this past weekend I cleaned and completely reorganized the garage which had been a pit of trash for months. It felt really good. This morning, I turned on my work laptop and couldn’t stop crying and wondered what the point of living even was. 

I know that the physical changes going on in our bodies after a loss contribute a lot to the emotional turmoil that follows. Hormonal changes and cycles “readjusting” can be extremely difficult to deal with while also trying to do normal life.

Hello fellow warriors-

We are just that....warriors.  I’m 36 and my husband is 33.  We’ve been TTC since November.  I started using Ovulation strips and bought the Premom kit in January.  Yesterday I had my second CP; the first was in April.  I’m feeling devastated but also feel like I can’t give up.  My husband stays positive and says “at least we know we CAN get pregnant...which is valid but also for some reason my body won’t let it stick past 4W3D. 

I’ve had bloodwork done to text by HCG after the first CP. and I had a pre conception “appointment” via teledoc.  I was worried we weren’t meeting in person because I really wanted the doc to get me a physical done, and some more bloodwork.  I’ve been pegged as “borderline hypothyroidism”, but she didn’t think it a big deal to check.  She was confident I’d be healthy enough if I kept eating healthy and kept running.

Now I am bleeding heavily; looking at demanding the doc do a physical next time and look into progesterone support.  I can start taking B6 at least for now.  I have read that some doctors don’t consider it necessary to refer you to a specialist or prescribe progesterone until after a 3rd loss.  What has been your experience if on a similar boat?

OB said that the pregnancy was likely not viable  from the start due to low progesterone (6.5) and small amniotic sac at 7w.

She also recommended testing my FSH and AMH on the 3rd day of my next period and said if my numbers come back low she’d recommend I go straight to an IVF doc without even trying naturally for a few months. 

All and all she was very reassuring about future fertility and non-committal about potential problems. (She said she has patients who are 42 and spontaneously pregnant! And it’s true fertility declines with age it’s still possible I’m fine at 38! One miscarriage doesn’t say anything.)

131,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone, I posted this as a very long comment yesterday so I don’t know if it’s allowed but I decided it might deserve its own post. Basically, there is often discussion here and in the PAL sub about scarring and whether or not that is common after miscarriage, especially a D&C. Googling would have you believe the odds are relatively high (some articles suggest up to 40% or more if you’ve had multiple D&Cs) which is a scary thought if you are trying to conceive again. On the other hand, when I brought this up to both my OB and to an MFM in a different practice (for a second opinion) they are insistent that the odds are very low. So why the discrepancy?

I believe it’s because there are peer reviewed studies that get cited that are taken out of context. I tend to get really into data so I decided to read this study in depth about the prevalence of intrauterine adhesions (scars). [here’s the link. ](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/20/2/262/663622) I chose this study because it is a meta analysis—it is a compilation of multiple other studies, so it has the largest sample of women.

This article is cited by many blog type articles, showing that about 19% of women have an IUA (scar) after a miscarriage and this number is higher for those with multiple D&Cs vs just one vs those who only had expectant management. Half these adhesions were mild.

I ended up reading this article in DETAIL and even read the abstracts of the individual source studies (it’s a meta analysis and pools data from multiple other studies.) My conclusion is this ~20% number is completely overstated and thrown around incorrectly by people who only read the abstract.

Why? This study is based on women *who had a hysteroscopy after a miscarriage.* That means women who had a miscarriage or D&C who didn’t decide to get a hysteroscopy couldn’t have been part of the study. What kind of women don’t get a hysteroscopy after a miscarriage? Well, me. People who aren’t having symptoms of abnormal issues with their uterus. People who conceived after their D&C. So when they say ~20%, they mean 20% of women who had reason to suspect there was something wrong with their uterus, were not pregnant, and got a medical treatment! That means 20% is biased and overstated. In fact, to be sure, I read the methodologies of most of the cited studies. Some of them weren’t even designed to test the prevalence of IUAs, but were actually designed to diagnose uterine problems as an explanation for that miscarriage—in other words, there was some suspicion that a uterine abnormality caused the miscarriage (not the other way around)—NOT the case for all miscarriages and not the case for mine, which were both chromosomal defects. 

Another piece of evidence to show how wrong it is to believe the 20% number: a whopping 69 out of 675 total women across these studies had a bicornate or septate uterus—10%!! For a condition that other sources estimate is between 0.1% and 0.6% of the general population. This all points to the same serious problems with selection: Women with abnormal issues with their uterus are getting these hysterioscopies and are getting studied, and “normal” women who have D&Cs are not.

Finally, two other issues: these studies were primarily published in the 90s (which means the data is even older), and also, most were conducted outside North America or Western Europe (quite a few in China and Brazil). Medical advances are a thing, especially in the developing world. D&Cs are performed with blunt instruments now, and sometimes are assisted by ultrasound. These all reduce the probability of scarring. 

TLDR: yes, D&Cs can cause scarring. Yes, more D&Cs cause more scarring. BUT they are probably more rare than Google would have you believe.

Googling would have you believe the odds are relatively high (some articles suggest up to 40% or more if you’ve had multiple D&amp;Cs) which is a scary thought if you are trying to conceive again. On the other hand, when I brought this up to both my OB and to an MFM in a different practice (for a second opinion) they are insistent that the odds are very low. So why the discrepancy?</p>

<p>I believe it’s because there are peer reviewed studies that get cited that are taken out of context. I tend to get really into data so I decided to read this study in depth about the prevalence of intrauterine adhesions (scars). <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/20/2/262/663622"">here’s the link. </a> I chose this study because it is a meta analysis—it is a compilation of multiple other studies, so it has the largest sample of women.</p>

<p>This article is cited by many blog type articles, showing that about 19% of women have an IUA (scar) after a miscarriage and this number is higher for those with multiple D&amp;Cs vs just one vs those who only had expectant management. Half these adhesions were mild.</p>

<p>I ended up reading this article in DETAIL and even read the abstracts of the individual source studies (it’s a meta analysis and pools data from multiple other studies.) My conclusion is this ~20% number is completely overstated and thrown around incorrectly by people who only read the abstract.</p>

<p>Why? This study is based on women <em>who had a hysteroscopy after a miscarriage.</em> That means women who had a miscarriage or D&amp;C who didn’t decide to get a hysteroscopy couldn’t have been part of the study. What kind of women don’t get a hysteroscopy after a miscarriage? Well, me. People who aren’t having symptoms of abnormal issues with their uterus. People who conceived after their D&amp;C. So when they say ~20%, they mean 20% of women who had reason to suspect there was something wrong with their uterus, were not pregnant, and got a medical treatment! That means 20% is biased and overstated. In fact, to be sure, I read the methodologies of most of the cited studies. Some of them weren’t even designed to test the prevalence of IUAs, but were actually designed to diagnose uterine problems as an explanation for that miscarriage—in other words, there was some suspicion that a uterine abnormality caused the miscarriage (not the other way around)—NOT the case for all miscarriages and not the case for mine, which were both chromosomal defects. </p>

<p>Another piece of evidence to show how wrong it is to believe the 20% number: a whopping 69 out of 675 total women across these studies had a bicornate or septate uterus—10%!! For a condition that other sources estimate is between 0.1% and 0.6% of the general population. This all points to the same serious problems with selection: Women with abnormal issues with their uterus are getting these hysterioscopies and are getting studied, and “normal” women who have D&amp;Cs are not.</p>

<p>Finally, two other issues: these studies were primarily published in the 90s (which means the data is even older), and also, most were conducted outside North America or Western Europe (quite a few in China and Brazil). Medical advances are a thing, especially in the developing world. D&amp;Cs are performed with blunt instruments now, and sometimes are assisted by ultrasound. These all reduce the probability of scarring. </p>

<p>TLDR: yes, D&amp;Cs can cause scarring. Yes, more D&amp;Cs cause more scarring. BUT they are probably more rare than Google would have you believe. Many of the articles that show high incidence rates are likely accurate—<em>for the pool of women in that specific study.</em> But there are specific reasons those women were included, and they are not always generalizable to you or me.</p>

I had a D&C on Jan 9th, and ever since then my body has just sucked. The procedure went really well, and I had very minimal bleeding afterwards and was told to expect a delayed period. But by the end of March, I was still without one! I was having cramping and a tiny bit of pink spotting, but nothing other than that. Due to Covid, I didn't want to come in for an appointment even though I was terrified this was a sign of scarring from the procedure. My doctor suggested taking a round of birth control pills to regulate things so I did.

I took loestrogin for one week and then suddenly had heavy breakthrough bleeding that lasted for about 10 days. I called the doctor, but couldn't speak to him right away and the nurse wouldn't listen and insists this is normal to have breakthrough bleeding. I ran her through my history, and she seemed annoyed. I skipped the placebo week because I was tired of bleeding and the bleeding was finally tapering off. I start the next pack right away, and again, more breakthrough bleeding while taking the pill. This time the bleeding lasts the entire time I'm taking active pills, and I just said fuck it.

I went off the pill, and decided to wait and see if my body can work this out on its own. I was just so tired of bleeding constantly. The bleeding stopped shortly after stopping the pills completely. After stopping the pill, I went back to eating keto (which always kept my previous long 45+ day cycles much shorter to between 33-38 days long), and started exercising again. I think eating better for my body plus exercising really helps my fertility (duh). I'm excited to return to a normal cycle since now my husband and I can start talking about trying again. Not having a normal cycle has caused a lot of anxiety the past 6 months.

I can't be the only one who has gone through crazy cycles like these. Anyone have something similar happen to them with crazy breakthrough bleeding on birth control after a loss?

We lost our daughter at 13 weeks a couple of days ago. I went into labor and just knew. I felt her leave my body, and saw the gestational sac. I knew she was gone. We were past first trimester. Her NIPT was perfect. We announced to everyone. It was supposed to be safe. But it wasn’t. She just was never meant to be our daughter. 

The blood loss was too extreme at 13 weeks to pass everything at home so we went to the ER and went the D&C route. 

I’m so crushed. Logically, in my head, I know she wasn’t meant to be. Something was wrong. Either the implantation was off and this would have ended even more tragically and dangerously. Or something was wrong with her and she was very sick. But emotionally - man does this hurt. It’s a hurt unlike anything I ever felt. I feel like I have failed my family. I failed to give my husband his daughter, my son his sister, my mom his granddaughter. I failed everyone. I failed my Little perfect baby girl. But I’ve focused on the sob story enough - so this post is about trying again. Trying once more to complete our family. 

I’m wondering. For anyone who went through this. How long till you started again? I am so so eager to give my son his sibling. I wanted them close in age. I don’t want to wait. My doctor said to wait for one cycle to resume. 

For anyone that had a similar experience - a late-ish loss with a D&C - how long till your cycles returned? Doc said hormone level was 27,000 so will take time to go down. I just want to start again.

157,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I had a miscarriage a few months ago. At first, I was in a deep depression. I have made progress in a positive direction since then, slowly but surely. I have worked hard to eat healthy and exercise, so I don’t look pregnant anymore. It’s helped me feel like myself again, if that makes sense - both mentally and physically. As time goes on, the sad thoughts come in waves and aren’t consuming me 24/7 like before.

My best friend is currently pregnant. She checks in every few weeks asking how I’m doing or feeling, specifically about the miscarriage. Every time, I literally say, “I don’t know how to respond to that. Not great.” Kind of blunt, but intentional so we stop this nonsense cycle. She knew that I was in deep depression months ago.

On one hand, I guess it’s good that she cares enough to reach out? But then, she will constantly say things like:
1. *”It’s so common!”*
2. *“Don’t worry! This happens to women all the time!”*
3. *”You better hurry up and get pregnant! You don’t want a geriatric pregnancy! Those are high risk! My doctor says...”* (Then proceeds to remind me of my age and how I will be 35 in a couple of years - the start of what doctors consider a geriatric pregnancy.)

These are just a few examples of the comments that she repeats, every time she reaches out. I understand that from her perspective, she has no bad intentions and is *attempting* to comfort me. But, when you say #1 and #2 to me repeatedly, I interpret that as minimizing my situation and/or my feelings about my experience. You’re basically inferring that it’s no big deal, and I should get over it quickly. *Just because it may be “common” or a statistic doesn’t mean it’s any less painful of an experience.* Her happiness and enthusiasm when saying these things (I understand in an effort to comfort me) is just off putting. When you say #3 to me, it’s pointless because my fertility/fertility issues/timeline of getting pregnant is all out of my control so your pressure is not needed nor welcome.

A woman truly doesn’t understand miscarriage unless she’s gone through it herself, which is what I previously told her and said from here on out I’m not going to her about it anymore. I said I’d rather talk to other women who have gone through it themselves and/or a therapist because people who have no clue say inappropriate things which just hurt instead of help. She told me to tell her to shut up if she’s ever done that. I was up front and honest and said you’ve said X repeatedly which minimizes everything like it’s no big deal because it’s “common” and “happens all the time.” Then the cycle repeats. It’s like I’m *finally* progressing and moving forward, but her inappropriate comments attempt to push me backwards (unsuccessfully thank goodness).

I don’t know about you guys, but it’s really exhausting when people are trying to be helpful but just stick their foot in their mouths and say hurtful/inappropriate comments. It’s ironic that I have to waste energy to think about how to delicately approach someone about this topic and be *accommodating to her*, when this experience is really about *ME* and *my loss*. I don’t want to be an asshole, but I don’t know what else I can do or say to let her know I’m not discussing with her anymore. I’ve already had this discussion with her very clearly, but it’s like she either forgets or doesn’t care. I don’t want to stress her during her pregnancy, but her level of oblivion is just exhausting and hurtful and I don’t want reminders every time she reaches out. Reaching out is ok, but honestly the types of examples above are just unhelpful and inappropriate.

Let me be clear - *she* always brings up the topic of miscarriage first. It’s not like I am dragging this on as a topic of conversation or anything. I don’t even discuss anything with her. I always end it right then and there as soon as she brings up the topic. I’ve been doing this ever since I told her I’m not discussing it with her anymore due to reasons above. Forgetting or ignoring my request is honestly just infuriating, not supportive.

I’m sure many of you reading have experienced insensitive comments from family/friends about fertility/infertility. How do you respond to inappropriate comments?

I’m (almost) 36 and we decided to ttc with my partner at the beginning of this year. To our surprise I got pregnant the first try but unfortunately it ended up as a chemical pregnancy. We then took a break because of the Corona outbreak since we thought maybe it would be more difficult to get appointments and care during early pregnancy. We resumed again in April and again I was immediately pregnant. This time it seemed like it was going well although I just wasn’t feeling pregnant, no nausea or other uncomfortable symptoms. Last week (at 7 weeks) I started to bleed and subsequently had a natural miscarriage. According to the midwife the embryo didn’t survive after 5-6 weeks and my body caught up to this fact at the 7th week. During the ultrasound she also saw a fibroid (i knew i had one, it’s asymptomatic) but it’s quite a big one measuring 6.3 cm by 7.8 cm.

I want to ttc again but I just feel hopeless that it will end in yet another miscarriage given my fibroid and my age. I was able to get an appointment with a good ob/gyn which is in 4 weeks. 

I guess I just lost trust in my body. Up until now I thought I had a healthy and a strong body. I have normal BMI and I rarely get sick. I have no chronic conditions and my cycles are quite regular. But these experiences just left me feeling like I’m broken somehow.

They told me to just stop today. Stop trying, stop testing for HCG at home, stop LH OPK testing at home, stop getting HCG blood tests through the doctors. (I had 4 tests and 3 docs apps to get results last week as my HCG is dormant and I thought there was a slimmer of hope I was pregnant again due a false reading in the lab) They said it can take a long time for HCG to drop and I just need to take a break and give my body a rest.

I want to take advantage of the most fertile time in my life right now as it can takes years for me to fall. I got all the tests and machines in the world and I got progesterone suppositories and low dose aspirin to increase blood flow all to help it stick. 

I don't want to give it a rest I just want a baby ffs 😭
But I guess I have no choice if nothing will stick, my ovulation has gone, I have no idea when the HCG will go and all the tests are just a lie and waste of money right now.

I found so much love and support here, and it turned a down day into a better one.

&#x200B;

Please note, before you read on, I do not mean to offend anyone by this - this is just how I have been feeling, and wanted to share/see what other people thought.

I was nearly 10w when I learnt I had suffered a MMC.  It was my first pregnancy, very much carefully planned and wanted.

I think back to the very early months of this year where yes, I was impatient and a little anxious, but I was not fearful or angry.  Now I feel that what has happened has caused my internal catatonic plates to shift, and has it has caused a rift, revealing a river of lava inside me - I have a low-grade throb of anger and upset with me all the time, and it's so tiring.  Sometimes it's barely there and I almost feel totally fine; other times it's very strong and overwhelming.

I don't want to feel this way.  I can't/don't even use word 'b--y' when it comes to describing what happened to me because I find it so triggering.  For me, if I could submit to a procedure where I could just remove all those memories (cf. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and be back in that place where I was at the beginning, I would.  I don't want to remember, and I don't want to have gone through this.

On one hand, having gone through this experience means that I can relate to the wonderful, brave, resilient women like yourselves, but on the other, it causes me a lot of pain and anxiety (why did it happen?  will it happen again?) that I would rather not have.  I only feel safe here and in the MC sub - I don't think I can ever go back to TFAB where most are so naive to this, and will remain that way.

I often feel fraudulent - I try and boost up others and tell them that things will be OK, reassure them that in the vast majority of cases these things are just bad genetic luck - but even though I hear my words, it doesn't quell these feelings.  I will say the one time I do feel any peace is when I'm trying to help others, as it takes my mind off myself.

I try and count my 'blessings' - I know we are not meant to compare losses, but I feel 'lucky' that mine happened when it did, I can't imagine being someone who is much further along than I was, and has to go through this for whatever reason.  Against all odds during this pandemic, I was able to get surgery so I never had to 'see' anything.  Everything seemed to go well in terms of my recovery.  I'm grateful that I was even able to get pregnant in the first place in that at least me and my husband's bits 'work'.

Regardless, I still feel hollow - like I'm looking at the pieces of a smashed vase and saying 'Well, at least they are big enough so I can glue them back together'.

I'm sorry - this is a real rant, but I just feel particularly hopeless today, I don't know why.  I might delete this later :(  Please tell me how you get through these feelings.

I've been TTC for almost 3 years now, unfortunately I suffered a miscarriage in Feb and had to have a DnC , my periods since then have been regular and I haven't had any issues related to the procedure (except for the clots that came out of me that were supposed to be normal but no one mentioned I'd get 😒) .


After a bit of background this is my issue now: Last week on Wednesday I noticed a very light pink mucous discharge only when I wiped,  since hubbs and I had just had sex I thought nothing of it ,well the discharge stayed for about 3 days and then changed to a dark brown color (like the kind you get after your period) and today it's more of a very washed out watery brown ( dont know how else to explain it) . Its only there when I wipe so its not even enough to warrant a tampon,  maybe a very thin liner if that. I'm still 9 days out from my monthly so there's no way this is an early period , I'm extremely regular in that sense .


My question is has anyone experienced something similar to this ? Has it resulted in a pregnancy or could something else be going on ? This is the first time it has ever happened , I didn't even had any bleeding from my first pregnancy since it was a missed miscarriage. I don’t wanna get my hopes up but according to the internet I'm either pregnant or I got cancer .

I don’t wanna get my hopes up but according to the internet I&#39;m either pregnant or I got cancer . I hope its not the latter but again if anyone has experienced something similar it would be great to know what the end result was. Thanks for the time and sorry for the longggg post .</p>

In particular, the anniversary of their death is hard hitting because you often relive those last moments and have to find a way to make peace with the fact that you have lived a whole year without them.

Due dates for lost pregnancies are so different though. Some people would say it’s silly to recognize them because once the pregnancy is over, the date dissolves in its importance or relevance. This pregnancy ended in January. But when you haven’t gotten pregnant, and that date is approaching, it seems like you’re facing all that lost hope with no relevant memories you can reflect on for comfort, except maybe the memory of being naively certain that being pregnant meant you would be holding a tiny, healthy human being in your arms in the near future. I no longer see that as a certainty. So the grief is about the loss of your own innocence as well.

I’m approaching what would have been my due date in July and now wondering what I can do to continue to process and leave that grief in the past. I’m ignoring the family member who is due on my exact due date with her 3rd unplanned baby from a different father (boyfriend of 10 months) because we all know how self destructive it is to compare yourself to people as if healthy babies are earned rather than incidental.

In January of this year, I became pregnant for the first time. My hub and I had been trying for 3 months, and it was the happiest moment of our lives. Four days after confirming the pregnancy, I miscarried at home. We were both devastated. I chose to return to work right away because I just assumed I’d be okay, but each month since then has been worse and worse emotionally. 

I’m using at home kits, and tracking my cycle with militant focus. I’m not pregnant (again), and I’m exasperated. Amongst all of the craziness in our world right now, I’m sure you can assume that my mood is pretty low. All I can think of is how intense my joy was when I first learned I was pregnant. I know babies don’t “solve” problems, but having a baby is a NEED at this point. My hormones are screaming “make baby.” To top it off, my pms symptoms have become aggressive since my miscarriage, to the point where my breasts are so sore I can barely move, sleep is non-existent, and my moods are like a teenager going through puberty. 

I feel like I would be better if I was pregnant because I’d have a baby to care for/look forward to, whereas right now it’s the same shit, but a different day. 

Has anyone had a similar experience with intense pms, and overall feelings of despair during the current global climate? What has helped you manage your feelings?

I found out on May 4th that my baby no longer had a heartbeat, I should have been almost 10 weeks but baby only measured 6 weeks 1 day which is what it measured 3 weeks before that.

I had my first D&C the 7th and 2 days later ended up at the ER for severe pain. I had an infection and ultrasound showed retained products. 

The 13th I had my second D&C and 6 days later ended up in the ER hemorrhaging. I was immediately rushed in for my 3rd D&C. I was admitted for 2 days and needed 3 bags of blood. The next day I was in pain and bleeding again. Ultrasound once again showed retained products.

My OB wanted to try something this time to make my uterus contract and hopefully get rid of everything. At that time my HCG was still at 8000. Nothing really happened and I was sent home with a follow up appointment for a week later.
At home I continued to bleed and have severe pain, a few days later I ended up in so much pain I was vomiting non stop. Went back to the ER, had a CT scan that showed the same retained products. I was sent to a different doctor and she was worried. Before doing another surgery she sent me for a ultrasound. At this point the pain had stopped and bleeding was period like. Ultrasound showed everything was gone this time. I do have a small cyst on my ovary and my lining is still thick. HCG was was 700.

Hi everyone, I hope it’s ok that I’m double posting. A member of r/pregnancyafterloss directed me here. My husband and I were given the sad news on Tuesday last week that I had miscarried over the weekend. I had been to see my OBGYN on Thursday where we saw the heartbeat at 6W6D. After a trip to the ER on Saturday for spotting and light cramps we were calmed down by seeing the heartbeat again at 7W1D. We were told to go to my OBGYN after the weekend to make sure all was still good. Unfortunately things were not all good and she could no longer find the heartbeat. I was diagnosed with a MMC and told to go to the hospital to schedule my D&C. It was planned for Friday but I ended up miscarrying naturally on Wednesday night. This morning I just finished up at my OBGYN and my HCG is down to less than 5. I am spotting very very lightly but physically I am feeling much better since last week. I am also very grateful I was able to spare myself the D&C. We have been given the ok to try and conceive again whenever we want to. As my cycle was already very irregular it doesn’t make much sense to wait for my period to show up when it might not.

We are trying to remain positive and are eager to start TTC. I’ve decided I am going to give OPK and HPT a rest for a little while. I want to just try and enjoy having sex with my husband again and keep the process fun and stress free.

I apologize if this is against rules, but I wanted to share a sub I created that I hope some of you may find helpful. (Crossposted from r/infertility)

I am 35F with PCOS.  After nearly two year of infertility treatments with ovulation induction and IUI, we terminated our pregnancy for medical reasons (TFMR) at 14 weeks in Dec 2019.  Yesterday would have been our due date.  Throughout this process, I have struggled to find information and a community online.  The situation has been isolating for me.  I feel like I don't quite belong in traditional miscarriage,  abort!on, or stillbirth/child loss communities.  It was also challenging to find quality information about perinatal diagnosis, abortion options, vetted providers, financial coverage, etc.  I wanted to create a community for those who have gone through this or are facing this.

I've written about our experience over on the r/NIPT sub in case the backstory is helpful.  

I posted on this sub recently looking for suggestions for a pre-TMFR sub, and many of you were helpful to suggest that this would be the right forum for my TMFR issues, regardless of our future reproductive plans (we're not sure we would TTC after all this - we have two LC). So, here I am looking for advice.  

One would think that a month of preparing ourselves for the final outcome would have given us the gift of time to come to the right decision for our baby and our family, and in some ways, the time has allowed us to turn over every emotional and intellectual stone.  But it has also placed us in the most excruciating version of limbo where day-to-day and moment-to-moment our decision on whether to TMFR could go either way. It's almost been too much time.  All the while, the baby has been growing, movement has started, and the ultrasounds don't show any visible issues.  Gut wrenching.  

We \*finally\* received a final result a few days ago and it's the least severe of the possibilities.  But that didn't provide us with any relief as it's still a syndrome with lifelong implications that range from mild to severe (severity of the syndrome can't be known ahead of birth), and various additional unknowns that we simply can't test for prenatally (whether low-level mosaicism may still exist despite 18 cultured amnio cells showing it doesn't, whether parental recessive disorders that can't be tested for will be present in the child, as they apparently can be with this syndrome due to the chromosomal issues).  Although rare, we have a fairly good grasp from the limited clinical reviews and a handful of other family's experiences on what it means for birth and the early years, and it's not going to be pretty.  Of course, the mild to severe range will influence that early experience.  But suffice to say, it will require a lot of intervention in the form of specialist appointments, evaluations, therapies, possibly (daily) growth hormone injections from an early age, etc.  It appears that they can ""outgrow"" some of the early issues, but try as we might, there is very limited data on what this syndrome means for their future as an older child, teenager, and adult.  We simply don't know whether they will go on to live independently, pursue higher education, have meaningful employment, enjoy romantic relationships, parent children, etc.

When we received the diagnosis, I found myself wishing it had been the more severe option as our path forward (TMFR) was clear and we were both at peace with that decision.

Our form of TMFR is medical induction, and given the final diagnosis, our state will not allow us to do so here as the syndrome is not considered ""lethal.""  We've found a hospital one state over that will take us, but due to gestational age we need to complete the procedure by next Saturday (one week from now).  As our continued sh\*t luck would have it, they need us to start the process on Monday, which means we need to take a decision in the next 24 hours and then make logistical plans to get ourselves there, arrange accommodation, childcare for our two LC, etc.

Has anyone in this group been faced with a TMFR decision where you could go either way? How did you make what feels like an impossible and life-altering decision?  On the other side of it (whether you ultimately did or didn't TMFR), do you feel that you made the right decision?

Glad to be here in a subreddit that gets me. I don’t think I can venture over to TFAB, at least not yet.

It seems like most people here experienced a miscarriage, but this is not what happened to me. Instead, I PPROM’d at 21 weeks and gave birth to my son at 28W4D (exactly one month ago). Due to many complications (the worst being severe brain damage) we had to let him go 3 days later.

My husband and I would like to get going on trying again and I’m getting anxious to do so. I’m just wondering whether anyone knows how long it would typically take for my period to come back? Unfortunately I also have PCOS so that’s just some extra difficulty thrown into the mix, but ignoring that for a sec, curious if anyone knows. 

If it helps, I expressed colostrum for a couple of days after he was born and then stopped cold turkey, right at the time my milk came in.

243,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi, I'm new here. Just discovered the subreddit and I'm so grateful. Hubby and I were TTC for 3 months when I found out I was pregnant on Memorial Day (5/25/2020.) A week later, June 1, I miscarried. I only bled for about 3 days and it wasn't very heavy. More painful emotionally and physically. I'm still in shock over it all. It happened so fast. I only got to experience being pregnant for a week, and even then the symptoms started to fade after a few days. My tests weren't strong positives and I started to worry. I called Dr. and was told by the nurse not to worry until there was spotting/blood. Anyway... the reason I am positing is because I am seeing so much conflicting information.

Some people TTC again right away, I was told by the doctor I saw (not normal OB, she is on vacation this and I saw an old school guy) to wait at least until August. I'm 35 now and will be 36 in August. Hubby and I hate that we are told to wait. The Dr. told me that I have an increased chance of miscarrying again if I got pregnant right away. He also said ""But if it happens, it happens. We can't stop you from getting pregnant."" So I just don't know what to do. I want to get pregnant again as soon as I can, but I don't want to lose another baby.

Just discovered the subreddit and I&#39;m so grateful. Hubby and I were TTC for 3 months when I found out I was pregnant on Memorial Day (5/25/2020.) A week later, June 1, I miscarried. I only bled for about 3 days and it wasn&#39;t very heavy. More painful emotionally and physically. I&#39;m still in shock over it all. It happened so fast. I only got to experience being pregnant for a week, and even then the symptoms started to fade after a few days. My tests weren&#39;t strong positives and I started to worry. I called Dr. and was told by the nurse not to worry until there was spotting/blood. Anyway... the reason I am positing is because I am seeing so much conflicting information.</p>

<p>Some people TTC again right away, I was told by the doctor I saw (not normal OB, she is on vacation this and I saw an old school guy) to wait at least until August. I&#39;m 35 now and will be 36 in August. Hubby and I hate that we are told to wait. The Dr. told me that I have an increased chance of miscarrying again if I got pregnant right away. He also said &quot;But if it happens, it happens. We can&#39;t stop you from getting pregnant.&quot; So I just don&#39;t know what to do. I want to get pregnant again as soon as I can, but I don&#39;t want to lose another baby.

I'm happy to find this subreddit I didnt think I will find such a community where we can share our experience ,good times and disappointment sometimes 


My Husband is 33 I'm 31 years 
We are married since 2018 Sept 

We started to try for a baby in early days of our marriage so we started trying for 3-4 months but nothing occurred 

So we went for a OB she checked me and I was having high levels of prolactin 

The doctor gave me a treatment ,so next month immediately I checked and I was pregnant 
After one week we checked the HCG and it was doubling ,the dr assured us everything is okay

But after couple days I noticed bleeding and doctor prescribed Duphastone AKA progesterone 

Any way the bleeding stopped we were happy about it ,we went to 1st apt and we heard the fetal heart in 6th week  .
In the 9th week while checking by doppler she told us ""I'm sorry i cant find the heart beats "" the fetal heart stopped before 1 week 

It was a devastating moment for us ,but we waited for one month and then admitted to the hospital with miscarriage. 

2nd attempt after this was 3 months after miscarriage. 

We hoped for the best but in the same time exactly the fetal heart stopped
Here we thought hmmm we have to check our selves 

We went through alot of tests , from clotting factors to Autoimmune disease to genetics to anything can pass to your mind 


Everything came OKAY!!

WE pulled our selves again we tried again I got pregnant in Feb 2020 

Was given aspirin with Clexan and folic acid and also Duphastone 
By chance I went to hospital due to some bleeding and they referred me to radiologist when she started checking.she said that did any dr previously told you that YOU GOT A BICOURNATE UTERUS ??
I WAS SHOCKED !! I DIDNT KNOW WHAT SHE IS SAYING ,WHAT IS B.UTERUS ..

Then after that ,the fetal heart stopped again in the same timing .

Conclusion : All three pregnancies were normal one but all of them fetal heart stopped in the same time .
Normal chromosomal for me and husband 
Nothing genetic

272,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Buckle up, this might be a long one.

May 10th we got our first positive pregnancy test after a full year of seriously trying to get pregnant. Memorial Day weekend, I experienced severe abdominal cramping and bleeding, so I called the emergency nurse line at my OB and was immediately put in contact with my doctor. By Tuesday afternoon my husband and I were in for a transvaginal ultrasound and learned I was on week 7 of an ectopic pregnancy. Baby was 5mm and had a heartbeat. A whirlwind of hospital check-ins, Covid tests, blood tests, and a laparoscopic salpingectomy later, I was home and devastated.

Today, I had my post-Salpingectomy appointment, and I had a LOT of questions. My doctor was patient and thorough with her answers, and I thought I might share them here, as I left feeling much better about my situation. 

DISCLAIMER: Everyone’s body and situation is different, and I’m not a medical professional, this is just what my OB told me.

I am exactly one week post-op, and still have quite a bit of bruising, but my incisions “look perfect.” I asked about the “new” bruises (ones that appeared over the weekend, as I got to be more mobile and sitting up) and she said that it wasn’t internal bleeding like i feared, but that sometimes with incisions and swelling, additional blood vessels will pop between the abdominal wall and the dermis. So don’t freak out if you’re more bruised and tender, but have no other scary symptoms! I also popped some in my eye, though she thinks that was from anesthesia (or rather my waking up from it.)

I asked how long this period-like bleeding would last and she said 2 weeks or until my hormones evened out. It’s not a real period, but my uterus having a “pregnancy withdrawal” as the hormones even out and the uterine lining is shed. 

I asked when my REAL period would be and she said it could be in 2 weeks or 8 weeks, depending on my hormones and when they decide it’s time to ovulate again. 14 days (roughly) after that, my period should start. She said we didn’t have to wait to start trying again if we felt emotionally that we would like to get back to it. The first period is good enough to give her a date, and to use the LH strips like normal until we see ovulation. She didn’t recommend trying immediately (before the first period) because a.) I’m still healing, and b.) it would make date tracking difficult.

I asked if she thought an HSG would be beneficial to see if the remaining tube was functional. She said that judging by the pictures taken in surgery, the tube and uterus look healthy and normal, and an HSG would only tell us if the tube was blocked (assuming it didn’t spasm during the dye test) and even then it wouldn’t tell us if a.) the cilia were functioning properly inside to sweep the egg down to the uterus or b.) if I was likely to have another ectopic. She said if it would put my mind at ease, she would do it, but it might be less stressful to just continue to try naturally.

Since we are going to keep trying, I asked what the protocol is now if we get pregnant again. She said to call IMMEDIATELY when we get a positive and they’ll start ordering blood tests every two days. Once the positive is in, the levels climb pretty quick, so we’d be checking to see when we reach 2000 HGC. Then they’ll do an ultrasound to see if the sac is there and where it should be. If it is, we hang tight til 6-7 weeks to see if the heart beat develops. If it does, hooray!

So here’s some numbers and facts she threw at me about ectopics and being down to one tube:

1.) If you only have one tube and both ovaries, your chances of an egg meeting sperm only go down by 15 percent! This is because ovaries aren’t actually connected to the Fallopian tubes! Think of them as little vacuum hoses that suck up an egg rather than a direct laundry chute. The solo ovary can still send a matured egg toward the remaining tube! Also you need both ovaries to make sure your hormones operate normally, so if it wasn’t damaged, there’s no need to remove it.

2.) if you’ve had an ectopic pregnancy, your chances of it happening again are only 10%. Now that we’ve seen what the remaining tube looks like, she’s optimistic it won’t happen again (90% likely it won’t, if you’re an optimist)

3.) 65% of women with ectopic pregnancies fall pregnant within 18 months and go on to have healthy babies. You’re not out of it yet, mama!

I put on just a couple of pounds during my pregnancy (lasted 9 weeks) due to nausea (steady snacking on carbs) and having no energy to exercise. Since my D&C 3 weeks ago, I’ve been back to my previous healthy diet and am working out 5 days a week.

I’m healthy now but I stay trim with diet and exercise, knowing that weight gain makes me feel really depressed. (At baseline I have a healthy BMI of around 20-21.)</p>

<p>I looked it up online and saw some stories about doctors saying it’s just due to hormones changing, but sone women said their pregnancy messed with their thyroid. I really do feel like what I did before I went on levothyroxine (I’m on a low dose of 25mg perceived by my RE because my TSH was over 3 before). I’m exhausted all day and can’t get up in the morning. This seems to have actually gotten worse in the weeks since my miscarriage and D&amp;C.</p>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts? My RE is in maternity leave but I did message the covering doctor to see if I could get new TSH labs. I really hope they take me seriously. I’m very in tune with my body and I’m aware of my food intake. I just hate feeling like I’m expanding without a baby in there 😔.</p>

I bled for a couple weeks after delivery and have not since had a cycle. After my 6 week appointment, we were told to go ahead and start trying again. All tests still BFN’s. 

I’m so confused because I haven’t had a cycle yet but all tests are coming back negative. I have been having very vivid dreams like I did in my last pregnancy but no other potential symptoms aside from some dizziness when standing and fatigue. 

I’ve searched all over for an app to track when I should expect my first cycle and if I could possibly be pregnant.

The lack of recognition for mothers who have miscarried or had stillbirths in fertility apps is INFURIATING. I’m angry enough with my medical team that they missed all the signs that could’ve saved my baby. (Id had extreme cramping for over an hour multiple nights in a row and they were dismissed as hicks) and after they told me her heart had stopped they didn’t even run a 3D ultrasound (which they definitely have) to see if they could determine cause; they made me wait until birth. I still remember early on in the pregnancy I was having belly pains and I went in and was treated like an inconvenience and a worrywort and basically just dismissed and sent away. 

 But these apps allow for diet, activity, even drugs and partying but yet nothing for those of us who have experienced a loss. It’s despicable. Anyone know of any apps that actually consider us?

I know it’s unusual to be given the go ahead before a full cycle after birth but because the loss was not associated with any deficiencies they said the potential psychological benefits outweighed the medical risks.
