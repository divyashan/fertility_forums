If you haven't already, find yourself a copy of *The Book Thief* and start reading! To those of you who are late to the party, free to jump in at any time during this month and don't feel at all pressured to keep going if life happens. This is just for fun!

Based on the Google survey so far, it looks like most of us finish up books within two weeks. However, there are still some folks who may want to take a bit longer. So I have a great idea. Let's do two books per month. We'll start with one, then start a second optional one on the 15th. This will give everyone the chance to keep up and stay at a comfortable pace. Totally up to you if you want to be on the speedy track or the leisurely track. Either way, this is going to be lots of fun!

I figured I should officially introduce myself. My husband and I lost our first baby at 12 weeks. Our baby only measured 6 1/2 weeks. At our first ultrasound, which should have been 7 1/2 weeks, the baby measured 2 weeks behind. The doctor thought the dating was wrong. 2 weeks later the baby had only grown by a week. Another week goes by and no more growth. After another ultrasound just to be sure, it's time to make a decision. We had a d&c on March 30th.


My husband has struggled through this, but doesn't understand how I can be triggered by someone else's pregnancy. One of my best friends is 2 weeks ahead of where I should have been. Of course hers wasn't planned. My husband and I planned ours. It was the first grandbaby on both sides.


Even though it's been almost 2 months I just can't seem to get over it. My friends just don't seem to understand how I can still be so afflicted by it. My husband feels the loss but doesn't want to talk about it often and doesn't know how to reassure me because he didn't get that same connection I had having had the baby inside me. I feel like I can't talk to them anymore because they keep trying to tell me to not be sad anymore. I want nothing more than to be pregnant again. I should have been nearing 20 weeks now. My pregnant friend was just over and my sister and other friend just rejoiced in feeling the kicks of her baby. I had to go into the kitchen to clean up some dishes to hide my tears and pull myself together.


I'm ao happy to have had this group as support over the last couple of months. You are the only ones who understand. Thank you so much for that. I'll go a few weeks feeling pretty good and then I break down again. I just wish I knew I'd get pregnant again quickly and that I could guarantee it would go full term and be healthy.

<p>Now that I have had this time off, I now feel different, in a good way. I can see things a bit more clearly and am now 100% certain that I am ready and okay to be pregnant again, and that I am actually happy about the concept of a new child, instead of doing it in desperate grief to get back all the things I&#39;ve lost. </p>

<p>Not advice or anything, just wanted to share how I am feeling. I have all this energy now and am excited to track my cycles again next month. I needed this break so bad. </p>

<p>Anyone else go through a time - off period that was similarly helpful?</p>

When can I start temping? I have to do it vaginally and the Dr said nothing in the vagina for a week/until after the bleeding stops. Start one week from today?

http://www.rogerknapp.com/inspire/loveforever.htm 

Edit: I was reminded by /u/BluebirdHaiku that Robert Munsch wrote this after his wife gave birth to two stillborns. When I found out this ts broke my heart and I saw my childhood book a whole new way.

My mom read this to me all the time when I was little and plan on doing the same to mine. It's close to my heart. I suggest reading the original first to fully understand my version. I don't know, it sounds kind of cheesy but it's still hard to read for me..

A mother held her new embryo and very slowly felt her stomach, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she held it, she sang:
I'll love you forever,
I'll like you for always,
As long as I'm living
my baby you'll soon be.

The baby grew. He grew and he grew and he grew. He grew until he was 7 weeks old, and she dreamed he ran all around the house. He would pull all the books off the shelves. He would pull all the food out of the refrigerator and he would take his mother's watch and flush it down the toilet. Sometimes his mother would be excited to be able to say, ""this kid is driving me CRAZY!""

But at night time, when that 7 week old had taken all her energy, she came home to her room, crawled across the floor, got into bed to see if her husband was asleep; she got in, felt her stomach back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. While she held it she sang:

I'll love you forever,
I'll like you for always,
As long as I'm living
my baby you'll soon be.

Then, the exciting day arrived. She stepped into the white room, layed into the bed, and saw her little baby bean on the screen. But the bean hadn't grown. He didn't move, his heart didn't beat. She was told he would never grow to be 1 year old, or 5, or 10. And he would never come in late for dinner, he would never have a bath, and grandma would never visit to see him. She would not ever want to sell him to the zoo.

So at night time, while her husband was asleep, the mother quietly opened the door to the room, crawl across the floor and get into the bed. If her husband was really asleep, she rubbed her stomach, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she rubbed it she still sang:

I'll love you forever,
I'll like you for always,
As long as I'm living
my baby you'll be.

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi Everyone,

I've been lurking for a while and commenting on some posts, but haven't formally introduced myself.

I've got quite a story when it comes to pregnancy loss. My husband and I got married in August 2013, and wanted to ttc immediately. I had been on the bcp for 12 years, and stopped taking the pill in September of that year. We unknowingly conceived in October. In November, my husband was out of province taking a course. I ""conveniently"" hadn't been feeling well the whole week, and just figured I must have picked up a bug of some sort. I had been lightly bleeding for 2 weeks, so didn't think I was pregnant (I figured it was just a screwy period since it started right when I was expecting AF if I wasn't pregnant, and since I just came off of bcp I was expecting weird bleeding to happen because of past issues. So I wasn't overly shocked at bleeding for 2 weeks). I felt increasingly worse over the course of the week, so finally called my doctor and scheduled an appointment for the next Monday. I didn't make it that long. On the Saturday night, I woke up from a nausea med induced nap on the couch with a massive cramp. I sat in agony and waited for it to pass, then got up and went to the bathroom, expecting a hemorrhage or something. I sat down on the toilet, and next thing I know I was waking up on the bathroom floor with my face pressed into the bathtub. I called my husband panicking and balling my eyes out to tell him what had just happened. He immediately called his sister who lived nearby and she picked me up and took me to the hospital. I found out at the hospital I was pregnant, but the doctor had an extremely concerned and confused look on his face. He told me I needed to come back Sunday morning for an emergency ultrasound (It was past midnight and I wasn't at the maternity hospital so they couldn't do it at that time) then go back to the ER to wait for the results. The doctor was worried it was an ectopic pregnancy that had possibly ruptured. Following morning I get the call to come in for the ultrasound. I had never had one before since this was my first pregnancy, so didn't really know what to expect. The technician wouldn't show me anything, and she took a ton of time doing the ultrasound. After she finished I went back to the ER and waited a couple of hours for the results. Finally got called in, and a doctor came rushing in, briefly explained something about my uterus looking like it was full of blood and I needed a D&C but would have to go to the other hospital. She said I couldn't drive myself, so I needed to go by ambulance, then rushed out. A nurse came in and stuck an IV in my arm, then I had more blood tests, then was rushed off into a waiting ambulance and transported to the other hospital and admitted. I met the gynaecologist when I got there, and she informed me I had a molar pregnancy. I had no idea what this was. And that my HCG level at the time was close to 600,000, and my uterus was measuring at about 16 weeks. We estimated that I was only about 5 weeks pregnant. At this point my husband had rushed back and was able to be with me. I was scheduled for an emergency D&C and finally had it Monday night, performed by a gynaecological oncologist. I ended up spending 5 days in the hospital because I lost over 2L of blood and tissue during the procedure and almost needed a blood transfusion. I also passed out after a trip to the bathroom. So I wasn't allowed to leave my bed alone for the rest of the time. The gyn onc told me that I may require chemo later on if the molar pregnancy didn't totally resolve after the surgery, because she wasn't able to surgically remove it all due to my uterus being way too soft. She wouldn't do any more D&C's on me, my only other option would have been a hysterectomy. I bled heavily after my surgery for 3.5 weeks, and suffered 3 hemorrhages during that time. Once the bleeding stopped, my HCG immediately started going up again, which meant I needed chemo. I ended up needing a strong course of 5 chemo drugs, EMA/CO, every week over a course of 5 months in order to get my HCG back to zero, and lost all of my hair. I finished chemo at the end of April 2014. Due to the crazy chemo and risk of relapse, we were required to wait a year post chemo to ttc. 

In January 2015, we ""accidentally"" got pregnant. I had taken the morning after pill because we were afraid of birth defects, etc from conceiving too soon after finishing chemo. Well the morning after pill didn't work, and the pregnancy tried to stick around. Because of my molar pregnancy we were monitoring my HCG levels monthly with a blood test. So when my period didn't come in February, I went for my monthly blood test, and my HCG came back as 18. The following week it was 19, then I started bleeding, so assumed I was miscarrying, especially since the HCG levels did not indicate a viable pregnancy. My doctors, however, were concerned it was a relapse of my molar pregnancy. After I stopped bleeding, my HCG level continued to rise. I was sent for 3 ultrasounds that couldn't find anything, and a CT scan that couldn't see anything. I ended up having a laparoscopy and D&C in March after my HCG levels reached 2600. It turned out to be a miscarriage with retained product that kept growing, but because of my ""pre existing condition"", my doctors freaked out and assumed the worst. To be honest, I'm glad they did and I wasn't just ignored, but it was a ridiculous emotional roller coaster. 

The last 1.5 years have been unbelievable, but they are finally over. We were cleared to finally start ttc last month. Unfortunately my husband works out of province now for 32 days straight and is only home for 10 days at a time, so we don't have too many chances to get pregnant. We're praying it all works out at the end of this month when he is home and we get pregnant.

Thanks for reading. If anyone wants to share their story with me, or needs to talk if they are going through something similar and just needs to talk about it, I'm all ears/eyes. The best therapy for me getting over all of this has been talking about it, and helping others experiencing something similar. Especially molar pregnancy since it is so widely unknown and even doctors and nurses don't know about it. 

Hugs to everyone! <3

A week later my hcg was at 18,000+ but there was no baby in sight so I had to get a shot of methotrexate.

We waited the three mandatory cycles and then tried again. I got pregnant again in March, but it turned out to be a CP and my period started a week after my BFP. So here I am, hoping that the third time is a charm. 

This last month has been really hard for me. My BIL's fiancée and my SIL had their babies.

Back story: I got pregnant my first cycle of trying. My husband and I were ecstatic, our families were elated, everything was great. 

At my first ultrasound, they noticed a few abnormalities with the umbilical cord or so they thought, at 8 weeks it was too early to really tell. They told me to come back 2 weeks later to check on everything. Other than this the heartbeat was strong and I told myself it wasn't worth worrying about until I found out more.

2 weeks later I am getting my ultrasound and I am informed that there is no cardiac activity in the fetus. Thinking it was something (possibly a cyst) with the umbilical cord I was completely blindsided. I have never been so devastated in my life.

After discussing my options with my doctor, I opted for a D&C because I just couldn't wait for this whole experience to be over with. He also told me that now they believed that the cyst was in the baby's chest.

After waiting and waiting I have finally got my period and my first cycle has officially started. My doctor recommended waiting 3 months but then said that people get pregnant earlier than that after a miscarriage and they have perfectly healthy pregnancies.

96,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all. I just found this sub and wanted to introduce myself. I had my first miscarriage February 2,2015 at 10 weeks. When I first found out I was pregnant I was elated. I have PCOS and endometriosis. I was on  Lupron shots for the endometriosis and got pregnant immediately after the last shot wore off. It was so exciting to know I could get pregnant! Because of the lupron shots and having no period for 6 months I went in for an ultrasound to find out how far long I was. I saw my little baby and the heartbeat pumping away, it was really happening I was pregnant. I was only 6 weeks so I had to wait until 10 weeks for my next appointment. This time the ultrasound showed no heartbeat and no baby. The baby appeared to have died shortly after the first ultrasound.  I opted to take misoprostol instead of having a d&c. It was a horrible experience and I will never do it again. My doctor told me to wait at least 3 months before trying again. In March I was hospitalized for three days for a pulmonary embolism. The blood clot in my lung may have been caused by the miscarriage or my miscarriage may have occurred because of blood clots. I found out I am genetically at increased risk for blood clots. So now I am on blood thinners and have to give my body 6 months to heal.

I just found this sub and wanted to introduce myself. I had my first miscarriage February 2,2015 at 10 weeks. When I first found out I was pregnant I was elated. I have PCOS and endometriosis. I was on  Lupron shots for the endometriosis and got pregnant immediately after the last shot wore off. It was so exciting to know I could get pregnant! Because of the lupron shots and having no period for 6 months I went in for an ultrasound to find out how far long I was. I saw my little baby and the heartbeat pumping away, it was really happening I was pregnant. I was only 6 weeks so I had to wait until 10 weeks for my next appointment. This time the ultrasound showed no heartbeat and no baby. The baby appeared to have died shortly after the first ultrasound.  I opted to take misoprostol instead of having a d&amp;c. It was a horrible experience and I will never do it again. My doctor told me to wait at least 3 months before trying again. In March I was hospitalized for three days for a pulmonary embolism. The blood clot in my lung may have been caused by the miscarriage or my miscarriage may have occurred because of blood clots. I found out I am genetically at increased risk for blood clots. So now I am on blood thinners and have to give my body 6 months to heal. I will have to switch blood thinners to shots that I will give myself everyday while I am trying to conceive and throughout any pregnancy. So here I am waiting to try again in November while it seems everyone around me is expecting. So that&#39;s my story. It feels so good to write it all out. </p>

I was doing a bit better and found the harder I was working in the garden the less I was thinking about my due date which is now less than a week away. Overall I would call it a pretty great coping strategy and I've been getting quite a bit of traction out of it. 

Anyway, today I was right in the middle of something I had to finish when the sky opened up and started pouring on me. I decided to tough it out in the rain and wrap up what I was doing. So there I am, muddy, sweaty, drenched in rain and out come my neighbors running to the car on the way to deliver their baby. All of the progress I thought I had made just collapsed around me.

I should have been carrying that hospital bag. I should have been the one having a baby. It just hurts so bad and I'm so afraid this hurt is never going to go away. I feel like it is going to be just lurking around the corner for the rest of my life and it isn't fair.
