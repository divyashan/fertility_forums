I thought everything was going normally post MC, hpt was fading, no more bleeding.

I was hoping we could try this cycle. So, one more setback. But what is one cycle in this disaster?

Then I get a call from the hospital. They say they don't recommend removing the polyp/placenta piece, because it may harm the uterial lining and cause scar tissue that will make getting pregnant even harder in the future. Instead, they recommend waiting multiple cycles to see if it comes out on its own with period. I'm going to the hospital next week to get checked, but I'm really scared of the procedure now.

I don't know who to believe. 

I'm getting another call with my doctor tomorrow. I hope it shines some light into this. But right now, my options seems to be:

1. Stop trying until the tissue has passed naturally. May take months. I'm not getting younger.
2. Do the procedure. Harm my uterus and never get pregnant again.
3. Fuck the recommendation and just try to get pregnant immediately. The piece of tissue would *probably* do nothing, but there's a small chance that it may cause bleeding or infection.

Our healthcare system is very different to the States, I feel like a lot of the members of this thread know a lot more than I do. I was hoping there might be someone out there who knows about APS.

I'll try to keep this succinct. 
My history:
Pregnancy # 1: LC 21/05/2017

# 2: MMC 8 weeks 01/04/2019 (measured 6 weeks, spotting followed by natural loss at home a week later)
# 3: MMC 11 weeks with D&C 22/06/2019 (measured 7 weeks)
# 4: MC 6 weeks 26/11/2019

Have now been advised I have an antithrombolin 3 deficiency and a protein C deficiency. Consultant Gynae called it ""sticky blood"". My prior knowledge and a little reading leads me to think that I have antiphospholipid syndrome (where my blood has too much clotting agent and is essentially too thick). However I have been given this diagnosis as a telephone consult in middle of UK lockdown so I can't get more answers. Part of a diagnosis of APS is recurrent early miscarriage. 

This does lead me to a second question around TTC during the COVID outbreak. How many of you are continuing as planned despite the situation?

Well, we weren’t trying, last year after 2 rounds of IVF, I started taking care of myself. I stopped focusing on “trying” we used withdrawal when I was ovulating and just lived our lives. I lost 50lbs, started therapy (didn’t connect with anyone and don’t have a good one now which I know I need to go do), and started to go to yoga daily. My husband and I started opening our relationship for some non monogamy stuff and we were having fun, we were so connected and in love. Then boom, I get pregnant, then boom, COVID and quarantine. My husband did not do well when he found out I was pregnant. He threatened to leave, he wanted to talk “options” and tensions rose to a pretty high level. He came down eventually, after a few not so fun weeks and we were settling into the fact that this was real and happening and it was ok. Not great, but ok. 

First ultrasound, 5 weeks, normal, great, baby is in the right place, not another ectopic, win. Second ultrasound, 6 weeks, 2 days, strong heart beat, normal growth, win. 8 week appt I had to discuss all the things, testing, diet, everything. And of course no in office ultrasound so let’s just book you for one more to see growth. I got in to another office the same day, and then I saw it. Baby stopped growing 2 days after the nice strong heart was seen. I fucking hate this ultrasound tech, she’s found other losses for me and she is a dolt. Like she must have a social disorder or something, or maybe it’s just hard for her but she couldn’t even give me her condolences. I wanted to punch her in the face. 

I didn’t cry until the nurse came in to tell me. A sweet, older OB nurse that should be sharing in my joy and walking me through my questions, telling me it’s over. I never met her before but I just cried. I honestly didn’t cry much, this is loss #5, and honestly, I don’t expect anything else. The sad face people have when they talk to me makes me sick to my stomach. I’m just a sad, fucking pathetic 35 year old with a trail of dead babies behind me. They scheduled the D&C a few days later and today I’m still just healing. A little cramping but the procedure wasn’t painful this time and I don’t think I retained anything (last time I did this they hurt me, didn’t get it all and I needed to have it done again after hemorrhaging a week later). 

So here I am, healing, this time I barely told anyone I was pregnant, not even my mom, but I called her to tell her I lost it. No joy, just pain. I have a group of girls I was in a sorority with in college and I told them drunkenly one night crying in self pity and they sent me copious amounts of booze and food. I’m lucky to have good friends. 

How many losses can one person handle? I’m 35, I gained 10lbs in the last 2 weeks from feeling sick and then being sad and “recovering”. After losing 50lbs and working so hard this just feels horrible. I hate my body again, my full pregnant tits slowly deflating, my stomach cramping now and I have the worst heartburn I’ve ever had from pain meds and overeating. This is #5, isn’t the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over and expecting other results? 

Part of me wants one more try, just one more. My husband said trying to console me after I found out we could try once more, but after his little tantrum when he found out I was pregnant, I’m not sure he is sincere. And what if the next one kills me? Another ectopic, or something else ruptures? Or my husband can’t take it and leaves? I was so sick for the 4 weeks I was pregnant, is it worth it when all I get is weight gain and a broken heart? And I was skinny finally, liked my body, was having fun with meeting new people and wearing skimpy sexy clothes. I’m back to frumpy and sad, not sure I want to be here again. I couldn’t do yoga for the past few weeks, I was dizzy and nauseated all the time. I’m rambling. 

This time, even knowing it probably wouldn’t work out, I envisioned a little girl of my own, a family, not easy or simple but a child of my own to raise and share my life with. Christmas morning, my old doll house, tea parties, my parents being grandparents. Thinking that likely won’t ever happen is a greater loss than the thing they scraped out of me.

Second ultrasound, 6 weeks, 2 days, strong heart beat, normal growth, win. 8 week appt I had to discuss all the things, testing, diet, everything. And of course no in office ultrasound so let’s just book you for one more to see growth. I got in to another office the same day, and then I saw it. Baby stopped growing 2 days after the nice strong heart was seen. I fucking hate this ultrasound tech, she’s found other losses for me and she is a dolt. Like she must have a social disorder or something, or maybe it’s just hard for her but she couldn’t even give me her condolences. I wanted to punch her in the face. </p>

<p>I didn’t cry until the nurse came in to tell me. A sweet, older OB nurse that should be sharing in my joy and walking me through my questions, telling me it’s over. I never met her before but I just cried. I honestly didn’t cry much, this is loss #5, and honestly, I don’t expect anything else. The sad face people have when they talk to me makes me sick to my stomach. I’m just a sad, fucking pathetic 35 year old with a trail of dead babies behind me. They scheduled the D&amp;C a few days later and today I’m still just healing. A little cramping but the procedure wasn’t painful this time and I don’t think I retained anything (last time I did this they hurt me, didn’t get it all and I needed to have it done again after hemorrhaging a week later). </p>

<p>So here I am, healing, this time I barely told anyone I was pregnant, not even my mom, but I called her to tell her I lost it. No joy, just pain. I have a group of girls I was in a sorority with in college and I told them drunkenly one night crying in self pity and they sent me copious amounts of booze and food. I’m lucky to have good friends. </p>

<p>How many losses can one person handle? I’m 35, I gained 10lbs in the last 2 weeks from feeling sick and then being sad and “recovering”. After losing 50lbs and working so hard this just feels horrible. I hate my body again, my full pregnant tits slowly deflating, my stomach cramping now and I have the worst heartburn I’ve ever had from pain meds and overeating. This is #5, isn’t the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over and expecting other results? </p>

<p>Part of me wants one more try, just one more. My husband said trying to console me after I found out we could try once more, but after his little tantrum when he found out I was pregnant, I’m not sure he is sincere. And what if the next one kills me? Another ectopic, or something else ruptures? Or my husband can’t take it and leaves? I was so sick for the 4 weeks I was pregnant, is it worth it when all I get is weight gain and a broken heart? And I was skinny finally, liked my body, was having fun with meeting new people and wearing skimpy sexy clothes. I’m back to frumpy and sad, not sure I want to be here again. I couldn’t do yoga for the past few weeks, I was dizzy and nauseated all the time. I’m rambling. </p>

<p>This time, even knowing it probably wouldn’t work out, I envisioned a little girl of my own, a family, not easy or simple but a child of my own to raise and share my life with. Christmas morning, my old doll house, tea parties, my parents being grandparents. Thinking that likely won’t ever happen is a greater loss than the thing they scraped out of me. I can’t even wrap my head around this all. I’m just sad. And don’t know if I want to do it again.</p>

I ovulated 13 days after the procedure and had an 11 day luteal phase with spotting on day 11, so it was a little short for me on both counts. Pregnancy test was back to negative 10 days ago. AF is heavier than normal with some very mild spiky pains rather than cramps. 

I also had a 4mm cervical biopsy during the D&C (they actually did it in error, the result was normal), but I don't believe this means I need to wait longer before trying again, only if you have a larger biopsy over 10mm (?)

The question is whether to leave it for a second cycle post MC before trying again in cycle 3? The major factor to consider is that I'm 40 this year. I feel like there's no time to waste. Equally I don't want to risk another MC by trying too soon, if that is a factor. 

Emotionally, waiting is the only difficulty.

I wanted to do a quick introduction. I'm a 27 year old female. My husband and I were married in October of 2019. My husband is 33. I wanted to share a timeline of what has happened to me so you can better understand why I'm here. 

August 2019 - stopped taking birth control pills

August onward - was having sex without protection, but never tracking ovulation 

November 21 2019- first day of my last period

December 25 2019- Merry Christmas! Positive pregnancy test 

January 23 2020 - first doctors appointment, only saw a sac but no fetal pole. I was told to come back in two weeks to check for growth

Two weeks later - February 6 - no fetal pole, our doctors told us we had a missed miscarriage. I decided to go with the cytotek instead of the D &C

February 6 - I miscarried at home and took 3 days off of work 

February 31 - I'm still bleeding since taking the cytotek, I decide to message my nurse and she encouraged me to come in within the next week for a check up 

March 6 - I took a blood test, my HGC levels were still elevated. My doctor said it should have been at 0 by this point. I went to radiology and had a higher definition ultrasound. They found an 8 week fetus on my right ovary. I had to have emergency surgery the same day. Luckily, I didn't lose my ovary during the procedure. 

March 22 - first day of my period, it lasted 10 days (was extremely heavy and painful) 

Today - still struggling mentally every day to overcome this feeling of guilt and shame. I can't believe I've lost two babies in such a short amount of time. My doctors have no idea why this happened to me, and I have nightmares of becoming pregnant again and immediately losing the baby. I want a baby badly, but my fear is taking over.

First off I just want to send so much love to the ladies who have been trying for years for a baby, because this journey isnt for the faint of heart. 

My husband and I decided to start trying this past December, so I ordered opks and was ready to go for it. I ovulated on day 18 of my cycle - I'm still breastfeeding our 1 year old so my cycles are 34 days- we made sure to DTD everyday of my fertile window and then came the dreaded TWW. On 15 dpo I got a faint positive, the first month trying and bam! Baby! 

I had two days of positive test before they became negative. Followed by bleeding and a diagnosis of a chemical pregnancy. I cried, I was upset, I was in shock, the line was just there and then it wasnt. 

We decided to try again, and like clockwork I ovulated 18 days after I started bleeding from my chemical pregnancy. 

On my sons first birthday(11dpo) I got a positive test, and felt like that was my sign from God that this baby would stick. 

7 days later, the bleeding started. I cried and cried and cried some more. 6 days of heavy bleeding, terrible cramps, and passing clots. Once it stopped I decided to take a pregnancy test to make sure it was over. 

The test was still positive so to the dr I went. My cervix was closed, there was nothing to be seen on the ultrasound, and my HCG was 37. I was told it was too soon to tell if it was a loss, or bleeding with a viable but early pregnancy. I returned 2 days later for blood draw and called the next day with results. My HCG had gone up, it went up 35% to a whopping 49. 
I felt some hope. 

The next day I went in for another appointment and blood draw. Still nothing to be seen on an ultrasound, and a rushed HCG draw result of 51.

I was told I could get a shot- but would need to stop breastfeeding for a time, wait it out, or d&c. 

I said I'd wait it out. The bleeding started again. 4 more days of bleeding, cramps, and tears. 

I was still nauseous, still hurt to breastfeed, and still didnt feel well. So back to the dr I went for a blood draw and ultrasound. HCG was down to 21. I was told to wait it out, or we could schedule a d&c. So I figured if I went from 51 to 21 in 6 days then I'd wait. 

I was at 21 a week ago, and yesterday the bleeding started again. It feels very much like a period however, I had a peak ovulation result and then drop 2 days ago, and am still getting positive pregnancy tests. 

I go into the lab for a blood draw today. 

I'm so over it. I'm tired of being in limbo, and tired of feeling out of control with my body. 

I just needed to write it out, I just needed to say it so I can stop thinking about it over and over.

Miscarried at home on what would have been 7 weeks, never got to scans. Worried about ectopic, but ended up with diagnosis of blighted ovum. 

Waited a cycle, tried again, pregnant again, found out on 23rd March. No excitement only disbelief and terror this time. Kept testing every few days to check lines getting darker, coz too scared to go to doctor in person (thanks covid). Got to 6 weeks and went in for blood draws etc which were OK apparently. Yesterday was dating scan at 7+1, sonographer looks for a bit and asks what the doctor said about my blood results and my heart sank. Couldn't find any sac. Switched to internal scan, and found a sac but too small to see anything inside... Measured at 4+6.

Doctor gets results in the afternoon and calls.. ""I don't want to get your hopes up, coz it's not good, 2 weeks behind... Any chance your LMP date or wrong? But I don't want you to be shattered either, there's a small chance it could end up viable if you ovulated late...come back for tests and if you do lose this one too, we'll refer you to a specialist ""

So now I'm back to limbo.

Miscarried at home on what would have been 7 weeks, never got to scans. Worried about ectopic, but ended up with diagnosis of blighted ovum. </p>

<p>Waited a cycle, tried again, pregnant again, found out on 23rd March. No excitement only disbelief and terror this time. Kept testing every few days to check lines getting darker, coz too scared to go to doctor in person (thanks covid). Got to 6 weeks and went in for blood draws etc which were OK apparently. Yesterday was dating scan at 7+1, sonographer looks for a bit and asks what the doctor said about my blood results and my heart sank. Couldn&#39;t find any sac. Switched to internal scan, and found a sac but too small to see anything inside... Measured at 4+6.</p>

<p>Doctor gets results in the afternoon and calls.. &quot;I don&#39;t want to get your hopes up, coz it&#39;s not good, 2 weeks behind... Any chance your LMP date or wrong? But I don&#39;t want you to be shattered either, there&#39;s a small chance it could end up viable if you ovulated late...come back for tests and if you do lose this one too, we&#39;ll refer you to a specialist &quot;</p>

I (26) got pregnant in January, but didn’t realize it because I bled a lot during the first few weeks (assumed it was my period). After two more weeks of BHCG tests, many invasive ultrasounds, an ER visit and countless calls with midwives, I miscarried at about 7/8 weeks. The hardest part for me was the elation —> disappointment, and I felt almost justified that some of my worst fears might be coming true/horrible thoughts that this entire pregnancy process may not work out for me and my husband (even though it’s still very early etc etc, it’s hard not to spiral)!

It was a few months sooner than we'd planned on getting pregnant, but we were so excited and what's a few months? I only bled for three days, but much heavier than a normal period for me.

Following the MC, I had two blood tests with declining HCG, and then a week later, a negative pregnancy test. We haven't really told anyone, most of my friends haven't had children yet or are totally uninterested in having children, so I feel a bit alone.

My issue is that I'm experiencing symptoms similar to what I experienced during the pregnancy, but I can't tell if I'm just imagining things and maybe this is just my body gearing up to have a difficult period following the MC? Recently, I feel like I can feel every time my intestines move, almost like mild cramping, and I'm just way more aware of things down there. I don't have bloating or tender breasts like last time (yet).  I took a test that was negative yesterday, but I don't really know when I ovulated (very new to TTC). I think I may have ovulated late after the MC, which would mean it was waaaaay too early for the HPT, like 7 DPO. I'm going to wait to test again until the day that I'm expecting my period.

By my cross road is, do we try again right away or not? On one hand with everything going on the future is really unknown.. how long will we be quarantined? Will I be able to get proper prenatal care? My husband and I both are both working (me from home) and are financially sound but if this continues will that still be the case? How will the economy be?

<p>This is also not the first time she’s made me uncomfortable with baby related stuff. One time I even had to reassure her that she wasn’t going to get pregnant using both condoms and the pill 🙄</p>

<p>I’m honestly really upset about this and I’m considering really scaling back in much contact I have with her. Am I overreacting?</p>

I never wanted to be here. I lurked around the trying for a baby subreddit for some time, and hoped I would graduate from it sooner rather than later. I’m still numb after hearing the news this morning. I’ve been crying on and off all day, and I don’t know how or if or when it’s going to stop. I haven’t really eaten, I can’t really sleep. Everything is just...empty. 

This would have been my husband’s and I’s first baby. I’ve been wanting a baby for years, but my husband just became 100% comfortable with it a few months ago. So we started trying. Our TTC process was a nightmare. Horrible ups and downs each month with each BFN, especially since I struggle with both depression and anxiety. And then this last cycle, cycle 5, month 4, I had a BFN, then AF. And it was awful. Terrible cramps. Horrible bleeding. The worst 5 days of my life. But a few days after I stopped bleeding, I was still nauseous. I still felt sick. And then I found out I had my first BFP. And I couldn’t be happy about it, because I knew something was wrong. 

I went to the gynecologist, and they couldn’t find anything in my uterus. Blood tests came back with low HCG, and abysmally low progesterone at .7. We’re waiting on the second set of blood tests to come back to confirm if I’m currently experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. 

This is my worst nightmare — other than infertility. I know a lot of women go on and have perfectly healthy pregnancies after ectopics, but I just feel so hopeless. I’m going to lose my little bean, my little bean that never had a chance, because somehow, someway, s/he didn’t implant in the right spot. And it breaks my heart just to think about it. 

My husband wants to keep trying, and so do I. But I just don’t know how to go on. How can I be excited about a future pregnancy, now that I have a higher than normal chance of having an ectopic? How can I know that I won’t lose another little bean, and another, until I finally can’t take it anymore? How do I go on from here? 

I’m so sorry for the rant. I’m just so heartbroken right now.

Hey Everyone. 

I am currently miscarrying my first pregnancy (Bleeding started on Tuesday, I think it’s almost done). I was not very far along, only a little over 6 weeks. We hadn’t told anyone about the pregnancy, only my husband and I knew. Now - I’m not sure what to do. We are heartbroken of course, but also always knew this was a possibility (even if we never really thought it would happen to us) which is why we hadn’t told anyone yet. I’ve spent the last two days crying and grieving, feeling a little better today. Last night my mom called and I didn’t answer because I wasn’t ready to talk to anyone. I should probably call her back tonight but I’m torn on whether I should let her know what happened or just not say anything. We are are by no means the Gilmore Girls but we have a good relationship most of the time, usually talk on the phone about once a week. I just don’t know if I can tell her “nope, nothing new going on here, we’re doing good, how bout you?” And make regular small talk. It feels like lying. At the same time I don’t know that I want her even knowing we’d been trying, don’t know if she’ll be sympathetic or if she’ll just brush it off with bingo terms, and don’t know if I want her looking at the calendar every month after this wondering when our announcement is coming - I want it to be a surprise when (if) we do conceive again. I can’t figure out if I want anyone to know about this or not. I don’t think it needs to be a secret but I just can’t decide how I feel about it right now.

We got pregnant last year after only 2 months of trying, but had a missed miscarriage in June 2019. We found out that there was no heartbeat or development at my 8-week ultrasound, and I elected to have a D&C 2 weeks later after a second ultrasound showed no change. My OBGYN cleared us to start trying again in August 2019, after I got my first period after the D&C. My cycles are any where from 30-34 days typically. A few months prior to conceiving the first time, my OB did put me on 50mcg synthroid after discovering that my thyroid was underactive (4.2) and I'm still taking it. I've been using OPK's since September 2019 and have learned that I either ovulate late (around day 20-22) or am not getting a positive LH surge. Since starting OPK's I've only shown an LH surge 2 cycles. This cycle, we were extremely hopeful because I was on cycle day 42 and no sign of my period - but two pregnancy tests were negative (finally started today on cycle day 45). I also just got the Ava bracelet, but have only been using it for 1 cycle

I've shared all of this with my doctor along the way (my OBGYN office has an app where you can message your doctor any time, which has been helpful recently with COVID-19). The nurse practitioner who works with my doctor is always the one to respond, and she seems to not be concerned at all- just repeating the same ""it can take up to 12 months to get pregnant,"" ""your 12 months started over after the miscarriage,"" ""it's normal not to ovulate every cycle,"" and ""it's normal for your period to be late occasionally."" I've asked about other options (Clomid, etc.) but haven't gotten far and am feeling very frustrated. I'm considering making an appointment with an RE (no clue how this works- does my OB have to refer me?). I know it hasn't been a full year of trying again yet, but I really don't want to go until August without knowing if there's something preventing me from getting/staying pregnant that I could be treating NOW. 

I'd appreciate any advice, even if it's to stop stressing about this so much (honestly it drives me CRAZY when people who have never been through this say ""don't stress"" or ""just try to relax"" because they have NO IDEA how this feels - but it helps to hear any advice from someone who has been here before). My mom and best friend are encouraging me to go ahead and make an appointment with an RE and ""be my own advocate"" (honestly their advice was to switch to a different OBGYN too, which I'm reluctant to do - sounds really stressful right now and I do like my Dr even though the NP hasn't been very helpful).

In tough times like right now a little kindness never hurts so I decided to give away my unopened [proov](https://proovtest.com) (at home progesterone test strips - pack of 7) worth 40$ USD. 

I was able to speak to my RE last week and got my progesterone level results (normal levels yay!) from the blood test that I did before everything was postponed due to COVID-19.

I know not everyone had/had the chance to test their progesterone so I'm giving my pack away for free to anyone willing to take it. It's a brand new unopened pack that expires in July 2021.

I am located in Quebec, Canada so just DM and I'll ship it to you :) You must preferably be located in Canada or the US.

Stay strong everyone and I hope this will help someone who needs it & hoping to get more answers. It's also my way to give back to such a helpful and supportive community ❤️

In 2016 we decided we were ready for a baby. We got to work, got pregnant the first month of trying and aside from a weird bleed around 12 weeks, the pregnancy was text book and gave us the most wonderful little girl. 

Around her 2nd birthday we were ready for another one. Tried again, it worked on the first try again, but ended in an ectopic and the loss of my right tube. It was scary but we felt confident to try again the following month. 

We tried again, got pregnant again on the first try and were THRILLED considering I was down a tube at this point. Everything was going perfectly again, though the pregnancy never felt as exciting as my first. I chalked this up to it being a 2nd child. But I just always had this weird feeling that I wasn’t *actually* going to have a son. I can’t explain it. 

We found out at the anatomy scan he had Spina Bifida. It wrecked us and we terminated the pregnancy in February. 

To let us heal emotionally and for me to heal physically and get folate built up to try and prevent it from happening again, we decided to wait until August/September to try again. Which with everything going on is probably better anyway (or maybe I’m just telling myself that to feel better about the wait?)

Ultimately though what I came here to say is after these two experiences, I look at my daughter in awe and disbelief of how easy it was with her and how almost ignorant I was to how difficult it can be. 

I would be lying if I said I wasn’t scared to ttc again, but I don’t want fear to stop me from having the family I desire. It is just maddening all the stuff that can go wrong and I often wish I could just go back to the woman I was 3 years ago when ttc and pregnant with my daughter.

<p>Ultimately though what I came here to say is after these two experiences, I look at my daughter in awe and disbelief of how easy it was with her and how almost ignorant I was to how difficult it can be. </p>

<p>I would be lying if I said I wasn’t scared to ttc again, but I don’t want fear to stop me from having the family I desire. It is just maddening all the stuff that can go wrong and I often wish I could just go back to the woman I was 3 years ago when ttc and pregnant with my daughter. Ignorance sure is bliss sometimes.</p>

My gynaecologist doesn't know what is causing my losses. The only thing she has diagnosed is a thin endometrium. She prescribed 500mg tocopherol (vitamin E) to take twice a day for three months back in October. I stopped when I got pregnant again. She also believes that progesterone support during the luteal phase could help with implantation.

It's possible that this approach actually worked with my third pregnancy because the embryo implanted very securely (it took two lots of misoprostol and a D&C to shift it) but that we got unlucky with a chromosomally abnormal embryo. She thought it looked like a chromosomal issue on the ultrasound but because we tried medical management first it wasn't possible to do a tissue analysis.

Now she has prescribed an absolute boatload of drugs for me to take. I'm back on the tocopherol paired this time with pentoxyffyline in the hope it will improve my lining. I'll take the progesterone again in the luteal phase. And she also wants me to take 100mg effervescent aspirin once a day, and 20mg prednisone three times a day. I'm not sure whether she wants me to take all of these every day (except obviously the progesterone) or only start them when I get a BFP. What she has written on the prescription (take them every day for three months) seems to contradict what she said during our appointment (give my body a break and start them when I get a BFP).

So, my questions. 

If you have been prescribed progesterone, aspirin or prednisone/prednisolone, how much do you take and when do you take it? Do you take it throughout your cycle (for aspirin/pred) or luteal phase (progesterone), or only when you get a BFP?

If you have been prescribed micronized estradiol to supplement your natural estrogen production, when do you take it?

(I haven't been prescribed this but my gynaecologist seems to be trying to improve my endometrial lining with the toco-500, pentoxyffyline and aspirin, whereas I think it could be linked to low estrogen in the follicular phase.)

That was one crazy roller coaster, everything looked good... numbers wise. Went in to see a heartbeat, blighted ovum. Told to come back in a week to diagnose - but my numbers were double/tripling. Not normal for a BO. Came back, the sac had grown but was collapsing. Diagnosed, doc recommended to wait it out - he wanted beta and blood count.

I was feeling pretty randy (which I was when I conceived both boys... sorry if TMI).

On Wed/Thurs of last week I noticed some pink spotting (I also had thick discharge... I thought it was yeast but it went away without treatment which can cause some spotting). I had a heck of a cramp on Thursday I know I experienced the same with the BO a few days before BFP. I was putting my oldest to bed in Jan and thought... Gee, that is early.

I got a positive strip test the day my period was due... but ended up getting my 2nd period a week and a half later. I&#39;m assuming this nutty cycle is normal following a miscarriage? My doctor advised me to wait two full cycles anyway to make sure my uterus had a healthy lining to start fresh.</p>

<p>Did anyone else conceive in their second cycle following a miscarriage? Is this all normal? Thanks so much</p>

Well — I’m in my 2ww right now and counting down the days to day 34 — got really long cycles. My husband and I reluctantly decided to try since we’ve been told to pause for the last 5 months — up til now. I’m also very fortunate to be able to offer my patients Telehealth services from my home (and have been asked to limit going into the hospital where I work to protect patients and the COVID staff) — so I’m unlikely to return to work until all this quiets down. Now to my question...

I had two miscarriages in the last year — likely related to untreated Hashimotos (which is finally well controlled. Yay!). During both pregnancies, I noticed an elevated body temperature throughout the day — sometimes getting to around 100.4 —- including during my early pregnancy days. I’m currently on day 24 and my temp has ranged from 99.4 to 100.2 throughout the day. I don’t feel sick at all. My opk listed peak as day 16.
