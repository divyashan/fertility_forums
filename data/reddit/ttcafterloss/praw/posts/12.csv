But...I was going to buy ovulation test strips and my husband got upset. He said he didn't want to track anything and get all crazy about it, but just ""let it happen"". He said it really bothers him and requested I not do that. He thinks it will make it a cold, scientific experience instead of just being lustful and natural. 

For those who don't know, we conceived on accident our first time...and he just wants it to happen naturally again. I feel like I am just interested in knowing when I'm ovulating and giving ourselves the best shot. I don't want to obsess and freak out about it (although I know it *could* turn into that). He wants to just make love all the time and see what happens. Now, we do have sex a lot, almost daily. So we should be good. But...it bothers me because I'm interested in tracking. He told me its important to him...and we agreed that we won't track anything until its been 6 months. I promised him, and I will follow through.

BUT...I feel slightly...I don't know. Sad? Bummed? Confused? I don't get it and just want to know what my body is doing...and want a baby sooner rather than later.

Has anyone else experienced a SO who isn't into the tracking and feels like this?

**UPDATE** Ok... You all made me feel a little less crazy for really wanting to track and being a bit upset/weird feeling about him not wanting me to. Since we already do have sex regularly, I can't imagine I'd start treating him like a sperm bank. And I CAN see myself getting obsessed but could reevaluate if that's the case.
I guess another chat is in order...to talk about me tracking but him just not knowing. That's a good compromise, I think.
We are going on a 3 week vacation and I think I'll talk to him about starting actually tracking when we're back...but that he doesn't need to know.

My sweet baby Amaryllis was stillborn August 28th at 40w+1, no cause as of right now, her heart stopped beating in the middle of the night.
(My birth story is in my history, if you'd like to read it)

A lot of people reached out to me and mentioned this sub, even if I wasn't TTC. I've been lurking but now comfortable enough to introduce myself.

We are not TTC as of right now, my doctor wants us to wait to at least December to give my body time to recover and though I'm not happy about it, I understand and know its for the best since I need time to grieve and process what happened before  dealing with another pregnancy.

I'm not happy about being pregnant for basically two years straight, I'm afraid that I'm going to carry full term and my baby will be ripped away from me again. 

I'm almost a month out from losing her and I'm having a really rough day. Sorry for the rambling, I'm glad there's a sub of supportive people for when i go down this journey again (:

Hope everybody is having a positive day!

I know a lot of doctors want ladies to wait longer after a cycle, but my doctor told me it might be a great time to try while my hormones were still elevated. I was told to expect my period 5-6 weeks after the D&C and ""not to take pregnancy tests before that or I would get false positives.

I wanted to share my missed miscarriage story in the hopes that I might find some kind words or advice here. I hope that my husband and I can try again as soon as my body is ready. Here's the story: 


I was 8+2 yesterday and I went in for a routine ultrasound. I had seen the baby's heartbeat at 6 weeks, which was reassuring, but I still had felt ""weird"" about this pregnancy from the get-go and felt terrified of having a missed miscarriage. I spent endless hours searching for statistics about missed miscarriage on the internet and lurking on the miscarriage/ttcafterloss subs. This is not typical behavior for me, by the way. With my son (who is 20 months old now) I didn't have any doubts that the pregnancy was going fine. But with this one I was worried. I guess maybe my body knew something was wrong and my mind could tell.


Anyway, my nightmare came true yesterday when the ultrasound tech's face got very concerned-looking during the ultrasound. I asked whether she was able to see a heartbeat, and she didn't answer me. (She was awful and had no bedside manner). I asked her again--""can you tell if it's alive?"" and she mumbled something about the doctor talking to me and pretty much ran out of the room.


So obviously at this point my husband and I looked at each other and just knew there was something bad going on. I couldn't believe it, because I had spent the last 6 weeks telling myself that I was being crazy worrying so much about a missed miscarriage. And here I was, having one.
Well, the doctor came in and was very sweet and helpful (unlike the ultrasound tech). She offered to do a D&C right on the spot. I accepted. I stupidly decided not to take the Vicodin they gave me because the nurse mistakenly told me it was Valium and I didn't see how it would help. Only later did I understand that I would need the painkillers. It was a very VERY painful procedure, but it was over in about 5-10 minutes. Afterwards I just sobbed on the table for about 20 minutes, and they left me alone with my husband. Last night I drank a whiskey and just went to bed, feeling numb.


Today, I woke up at 5am and couldn't stop thinking about the miscarriage. Did I do something wrong? I did several things this pregnancy that I probably shouldn't have done, like: 1) Dye my hair at about 3 weeks, 2) drink half a beer twice around 5-6 weeks, 3) run and do yoga, maybe too strenuously, 4) eat bacon a lot (maybe it had listeria in it)?


So of course I am beating myself up about all the things I might have done to cause this. And if it wasn't that, then I wonder if I made this happen just by thinking and worrying too much about a missed miscarriage. I know that sounds superstitious, but I can't help but feel spooked by how I had these premonitions about it. Either way, my little baby is gone, and I'm feeling really devastated and not sure what to do.


My husband went off to play golf this morning, which really hurt my feelings on top of everything. I felt like I really could have used the support. I have a prescription for Xanax and Vicodin that I could pick up at the pharmacy, and I am very tempted to just take some pills and drink and just not feel anything today. I just feel really alone.

I wanted to share my missed miscarriage story in the hopes that I might find some kind words or advice here. I hope that my husband and I can try again as soon as my body is ready. Here&#39;s the story: </p>

<p>I was 8+2 yesterday and I went in for a routine ultrasound. I had seen the baby&#39;s heartbeat at 6 weeks, which was reassuring, but I still had felt &quot;weird&quot; about this pregnancy from the get-go and felt terrified of having a missed miscarriage. I spent endless hours searching for statistics about missed miscarriage on the internet and lurking on the miscarriage/ttcafterloss subs. This is not typical behavior for me, by the way. With my son (who is 20 months old now) I didn&#39;t have any doubts that the pregnancy was going fine. But with this one I was worried. I guess maybe my body knew something was wrong and my mind could tell.</p>

<p>Anyway, my nightmare came true yesterday when the ultrasound tech&#39;s face got very concerned-looking during the ultrasound. I asked whether she was able to see a heartbeat, and she didn&#39;t answer me. (She was awful and had no bedside manner). I asked her again--&quot;can you tell if it&#39;s alive?&quot; and she mumbled something about the doctor talking to me and pretty much ran out of the room.</p>

<p>So obviously at this point my husband and I looked at each other and just knew there was something bad going on. I couldn&#39;t believe it, because I had spent the last 6 weeks telling myself that I was being crazy worrying so much about a missed miscarriage. And here I was, having one.
Well, the doctor came in and was very sweet and helpful (unlike the ultrasound tech). She offered to do a D&amp;C right on the spot. I accepted. I stupidly decided not to take the Vicodin they gave me because the nurse mistakenly told me it was Valium and I didn&#39;t see how it would help. Only later did I understand that I would need the painkillers. It was a very VERY painful procedure, but it was over in about 5-10 minutes. Afterwards I just sobbed on the table for about 20 minutes, and they left me alone with my husband. Last night I drank a whiskey and just went to bed, feeling numb.</p>

<p>Today, I woke up at 5am and couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the miscarriage. Did I do something wrong? I did several things this pregnancy that I probably shouldn&#39;t have done, like: 1) Dye my hair at about 3 weeks, 2) drink half a beer twice around 5-6 weeks, 3) run and do yoga, maybe too strenuously, 4) eat bacon a lot (maybe it had listeria in it)?</p>

<p>So of course I am beating myself up about all the things I might have done to cause this. And if it wasn&#39;t that, then I wonder if I made this happen just by thinking and worrying too much about a missed miscarriage. I know that sounds superstitious, but I can&#39;t help but feel spooked by how I had these premonitions about it. Either way, my little baby is gone, and I&#39;m feeling really devastated and not sure what to do.</p>

<p>My husband went off to play golf this morning, which really hurt my feelings on top of everything. I felt like I really could have used the support. I have a prescription for Xanax and Vicodin that I could pick up at the pharmacy, and I am very tempted to just take some pills and drink and just not feel anything today. I just feel really alone. Thanks for listening...I guess I just needed to get this out.</p>

DH and I agreed to start trying in December a while ago, but lately I have been so depressed and having crying spells. It's been almost a year since our miscarriage and although the counciling and time has helped, it Hasn't filled the void I've been feeling ever since. 

I'm still awaiting my bloodwork for pcos, but my ultrasound showed several small cysts on my ovaries. I feel like this was ""icing on the cake"", not only do I have to wait another 3 months to start trying,  we will also have this stupid pcos to deal with and I'll more than likely be going on clomid. Husband says it's right around the corner, which I get, but I've already waiting a year and I thought I'd be pregnant again by now. I told him I honestly feel like I'll be depressed until we are actively trying.

He said he doesn't want to see me depressed, so we can start trying now. It was what I wanted him to say, but now I feel like I guilt tripped my husband into starting earlier. We talked about having a middle ground between then and now, so we are set on October 26th which is when we are going on our belated honeymoon. I honestly feel so much more content knowing it's only a month away, but I don't want my husband to think that I'm unhappy in our marriage because we don't have a baby.  I really hate feeling all of these feels at once, I know a lot of people on here wait usually wait a month or two after a loss but has anyone had a similar experience to this? I've told him how happy I am with him, but it's really killing me inside feeling like there's a piece of the puzzle missing.

For the past couple of days, I had been experiencing some mild to moderate cramps. Sometimes I would get rectal pressure when I sat down, like I had to go to the bathroom. I thought nothing of the cramps, until I started bleeding yesterday afternoon. My husband rushed me to the ER where they immediately drew blood and made me pee in a cup. 

We had to wait forever to have an ultrasound and by that time my daughter was starting to melt down, so I had to go alone. The ultrasound was silent, no comments made by the tech. Having been in this situation enough, I know that no news is bad news. When she left the room to let me clean up, I took a peek at the monitor just to get some clue of what was going on. There I saw a sac but no baby. Now I have had a blighted ovum before, but this time was different. With this pregnancy, we had an ultrasound at 7 weeks. We saw a baby and heard a heart beat at that appointment. We were told I ovulated from my left ovary even though I no longer have my fallopian tube on that side.

After giving me some morphine and doing a pelvic exam, the doctor came in to say that they could not find a fetus and I was probably having another miscarriage. He told me to call my OB on Monday to schedule follow up appointments. I was sent on my way last night with a prescription for hydrocodone.

So here I am again. This is our third loss since last October. This time hasn't really hit me as hard yet. I have only gotten upset twice, when we took the ultrasound picture off the fridge, and when the pain got so bad at work today that I had to tell my supervisor so I could go home.

first post here, have been lurking since last cycles turn to a CP. I am part way through the next cycle now. 

Just wondering what your cycles were like following a CP or MC? We're your ""more fertile"" did you O the same day as normal?


Last cycle I had my positive OPK on this day and this cycle nothing, some slightly watery CM but may be just leftover fluids from sex? 
Just concerned this one may be abnormally long?
Normally they are in and around 30 days.


Tia!

I'm guessing that the ""period"" I had last month was actually a MC and I just happened to catch my HCG levels with a FRER on a downward swing since then. 

I was waiting to tell my husband about the pregnancy until I had gotten the tests back from the doctor so right now he knows nothing. I'm not sure how or what to tell him. Not sure if I really want to say anything so that he can have bliss in ignorance. We just started trying and I don't want to sour any of the experience for him.

On Tuesday, I've got my first appointment at a fertility clinic. My gynae wants me to go because she thinks my iffy progesterone and prolific fibroids need to be investigated. She finds it disconcerting that I had so many fibroids, and that they seem to grow very quickly. I don't know what I should do at this appointment. 
    
I didn't have difficulty conceiving James. Yes, I needed the myomectomy, but once that was finished, we conceived relatively quickly. His loss didn't appear to have had anything to do with my uterus, just my cervix. 
     
Even though we've been trying since January, the gynae doesn't think that the tries before the myomectomy could have possibly resulted in a pregnancy due to the fibroids. So let's say we've only had since April to get some good, proper attempts in. There was a month that we only managed O-3 and O-2 in, so I'm going to discount that month, and then the month of my surgery, so that one's out too. So technically, we've only had 5 really solid tries. 
   
So here's what I've been getting at... what do I want from the RE? What should I ask? What is the testing that I should be pushing for?
   
All that I really understand that I need is the six month check for my fibroids to see of there is new growth, but aside from this, even with the progesterone levels, I don't know what to say, how to prepare, what to ask. I don't feel that I can say that I'm dealing with infertility, we've only had five solid tries. 
  
I'm also still trying to wrap my head about the idea that going to the RE is OK. I'm so paranoid that people experiencing infertility will look at me and think that I'm trivializing their conditions. I don't want to be that person magnifying my issues unnecessarily.
     
So, yes. I am at a loss. Does anyone have tips on how to prepare? I always go in to doctors offices armed with a list of things I want to discuss, but this time I feel a bit bewildered. I'm almost tempted to be a passive patient but I know I can't do that. I'll be haunted forever by being a passive patient when my cervix was dilating and my midwife was having me trust my body and being all hippie-dippy. 
   
Maybe my anxiety is catching up with me and this situation isn't as scary as it appears. 
  
Anyway.

I just wanted to informally survey you lovely people to check in about my luteal phase. I just finished my first full postpartum cycle and it was only an 8 day LP. This was a bummer since we had perfectly timed sex :(. Since we are somewhat impatient (see age. see stillbirth), and because we are learning as we go, I thought I'd post here to see if anyone has anything to suggest or add to the conversation. A couple people did already provide some reassurance on my post from yesterday (thanks guys!)

So now I completely understand this is normal for the first cycle or two, but I wonder - will I look back and wish I had done some easy tweak for this second cycle? I'm currently on CD2. I temp and use OPKs and check CM (thanks to advice from here). 

Internet research talks some about vitamins, so I'll include my list of supplements here for those who like to geek out on it:
My prenatal vitamins (Emerald Laboratories) include 50 mg of B6 and 200 mcg of B12. I also take 125 mcg of Magnesium Citrate, 1 baby aspirin, 500 more mcg of B12 (for migraines), 500 mg of Omega 3, 500 mg of Calcium with vitamin D (1000 IU), and 500 extra mg of vitamin C.

So my current plan is to call my doctor if this second LP is also too short. But I'm crossing my fingers that my body will do its part this time. ;)

I'm not dealing with infertility right now, I had a MMC last week and am just waiting for ovulation to occur so I can try and be fertilized again. Trying to stay positive, however, this post really hit close to home and I wondered if anyone else has avoided certain social situations to not have a meltdown.

My amazing SIL & BIL are expecting and celebrating their birthdays this weekend and I told her I was sick and couldn't make it.

(I've only told my parents, in-laws and a couple friends. I've asked the ILs not to tell BIL & SIL yet.) Maybe in a week or two I'll come clean and apologize but right now I just want a little more time to myself. 

My husband doesn't quite get it, but admits he probably won't because I experienced the loss physically and emotionally in a way he can't comprehend. He tried to have me explain why I didn't want go and it was hard.

Every day, he's been sneaking to the basement in the mornings to watch porn and masturbate. We've been married for one year three months, he's been doing this for one year. He would rather masturbate than have sex. He would rather watch some other woman get fucked than be intimate with me.

Don't get me wrong...I have a **crazy** sex drive. I could have sex three times a day and still not have enough. I'm more than willing. I get dressed up, I role play with him, I do a ton of the work, I try everything he wants to, I rarely say no to him when he requests sex, I send him sexy messages all day and try to flirt throughout the day, I tell him constantly how much I desire him, respect him, love him, want him.

I've asked him point blank on numerous occasions if he had been watching porn and he's lied. A lot. After sex he would say ""oh man, that's going to be a lot because it's been two days since we've had sex!"" when he had actually masturbated that morning and the morning before. 

In the past couple of months, I've feel horribly pressured to do anal and give him blow jobs. We've tried anal twice before and both times I cried because it hurt so badly and I tore, but he still pressured me constantly to try a third time. And blow jobs. I hate them. I have TMJ so my jaw is constantly inflamed, clicking, popping, and in pain.  

Before we got married, we vowed that we would never cheat on each other, which included porn. He told me how disgusting it was and how degrading it is. He told me he stopped watching porn when we started dating. Turns out, there was only that three month break right when we got married. 

I feel shattered. My world is upside down and I'm scared to share this here because I know so many people think ""oh, it's just porn, everyone does it, it's just a natural thing he does, you're overreacting."" But I don't feel that way! I feel empty! I feel like I've lost three babies and now I've lost my husband! Every single woman he looked at is now in our sex life. He told me he's thought of them when having sex with me.  He cheated on me. I don't care if it's not conventional to say that, he cheated on me. I honestly wish he had fucked one other woman than watch hundreds of other women get fucked. To me, it's the same thing, the same feeling. 

He assures me it's not my fault and that this has been going on long before we met. But after all the shit we've been through, I can't help but think it was me somehow. 

It also came out that he hasn't been fully engaged with TTC because he hasn't felt ready to be a father since he was secretly being a horrible husband. Then I found myself thinking, ""well maybe I'm not pregnant because you fucking masturbate constantly so there's no sperm!"" Or ""maybe I miscarried three times because I'm not supposed to have children with you."" So that's a whole new deal that we have to try to work out. FUCK.

He's gone for the weekend on a church men's retreat. He says he's going to share this with everyone up there, which is huge because he's a very introverted guy. He says he's going to go meet with the pastor of our church and find ways to help rebuild trust and become sexually intimate with me again. I'm going to visit a friend tonight and maybe escape reality for a bit in some way. Life hurts too much to even fucking breathe right now.

I'm always going to feel like he's seeing another woman when he's looking at me. I changed my shirt last night and felt so self conscious suddenly and turned away from him. How many other women's breasts has he seen? Mine aren't special. I'm not the only one. He's seen other women get savagely fucked. 

When he told me, I had a panic attack. The first one I've had in three years, and I told him I was thinking about a divorce. We agreed never to talk about that and I feel shitty for bringing it up but...our whole relationship has been built on lies. The first year of our marriage, one of the most critical times, has been a big fat fucking lie day after day! How could he keep this secret from me for so long? How can I ever trust him? 

I don't even know this man! The man I married would **NEVER** do this. I told him I was mourning that man; that man who was truthful, loyal, faithful, and loving. He's not a single one of those things right now. 

We're finding a new marriage counselor (our old one said some shitty things about our infertility and is also fucking ancient) and I'm going to try to find a support group for this. Trying for a baby is on hold indefinitely. He's going to deal with his shit with a counselor by himself and I'm considering also going to a counselor just for me to deal with this grief. We need some serious help if this marriage is to continue. 

Anyway, I'm sorry this is so long and I want to thank any of you who made it all the way through. Do I need anything? Yes. *Please* pray for me and my marriage and my husband.
