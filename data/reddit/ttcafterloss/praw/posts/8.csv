It has been a rough week. We found out the baby stopped growing at 8w4d on Monday when we should have been 10w4d with no HB and have been trying all possible home remedies to start the process. I have been drinking Red Raspberry Leaf tea, tried Sepia, Sabina, and black cohosh (HORRIBLE). I feel like I can't talk to anyone about any of this... DH is amazing and is there for me, but he is also sensitive to details about blood and such, when I started asking what to do if when it happens we see the fetus and he just about threw up... Not to mention how hard he is taking the loss in general. We decided to tell family early for Father's day, it was the best weekend of my life and I have amazing video reactions of them all, but had to now tell them all we lost the baby. 

My over bearing mother is telling me how to deal with this, someone who had not experienced a m/c, as in my diet is wrong, I am not walking enough (just about every day...) and what month to start to try again. I do not need anyone to tell me about my sex life, ESPECIALLY my mother. I just wish I could have a conversation with her that doesn’t involve babies at all. Instead of this wonderful surprise it will now be the entire family waiting for us to conceive, there will be no more crying and screaming, only monthly calls to know if I have started my period. I don’t know what to do to end this. 

I thought we were moving forward with the emotional aspect, but yesterday went from feeling better to burn-the-world-down mad. I am SO MAD. I hate that this has happened! I hate reading about all of you amazing women dealing with things like this! I had to stay off this thread yesterday and most of today because of how angry I am! Why does this happen??? I am reading online posts on how to have a natural miscarriage and these blogs are filled with people wanting to end healthy pregnancies... how many of us would kill to have a healthy baby! I know its not healthy to think like that, but I am starting to lose hope and this is only one miscarriage. I am trying to have the testing done on me and DH to see if anything could be wrong, I don't think I could handle this again. 

I was hoping to talk to friends about this, but I know going into it I had no idea that this is what happens, they know we lost the baby, but I don’t think they understand that I am still carrying him… And it kills my heart! How long am I supposed to wait? I have NO signs! I want to call the doctor Monday to have a back up of the medication for Friday, but she was so adamant about a natural miscarriage that I worry she will think I’m weak, and I feel weak for not wanting to wait. I just want this over so we can try again and be happy. I am such an emotional wreck, I will go off on the smallest things anymore. I was just hoping this post would help me to get some stuff off my chest, I just don’t know who to turn to right now and even with a huge support group I feel so alone. 

**tl;dr 1st m/c and pissed off- Venting**

*Any suggestions on how to jump start the m/c process??*

*How long after m/c did you try?? I have read some that didn't even wait for their first period and had a healthy baby! I want that to be me, but I have no idea if that could raise my risk of another m/c*

P.S. How do you handle people who take it for granted?? SIL got pregnant on purpose before her wedding the first try (took us 4 months) and announced on social media the same day with pics of her and the pregnancy test. Second child she waited until 6 weeks to announce on social media... She currently lives with my in-laws while her husband is deployed and EXPECTS them to do just about everything for her children and gets pissed off as soon as they have their own plans (like taking family to the airport when they were supposed to watch the children so she could go to a party... Nephew is 2 1/2, Niece is 11 weeks). We live around 2 hours away from both families and haven't seen anyone in person since the news, but I am very concerned to see SIL act out again and me try not to hit her in the face... lol, advice on handling people is greatly appreciated!",t2_o6iwa,False,,0,False,First M/C and joining ttcafterloss,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_3c8sau,False,dark,0.84,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,8,,False,self,1436140048.0,,[],{},,True,,1436168223.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Very long, first real post, sorry!</p>

<p>It has been a rough week. We found out the baby stopped growing at 8w4d on Monday when we should have been 10w4d with no HB and have been trying all possible home remedies to start the process. I have been drinking Red Raspberry Leaf tea, tried Sepia, Sabina, and black cohosh (HORRIBLE). I feel like I can&#39;t talk to anyone about any of this... DH is amazing and is there for me, but he is also sensitive to details about blood and such, when I started asking what to do if when it happens we see the fetus and he just about threw up... Not to mention how hard he is taking the loss in general. We decided to tell family early for Father&#39;s day, it was the best weekend of my life and I have amazing video reactions of them all, but had to now tell them all we lost the baby. </p>

<p>My over bearing mother is telling me how to deal with this, someone who had not experienced a m/c, as in my diet is wrong, I am not walking enough (just about every day...) and what month to start to try again. I do not need anyone to tell me about my sex life, ESPECIALLY my mother. I just wish I could have a conversation with her that doesn’t involve babies at all. Instead of this wonderful surprise it will now be the entire family waiting for us to conceive, there will be no more crying and screaming, only monthly calls to know if I have started my period. I don’t know what to do to end this. </p>

<p>I thought we were moving forward with the emotional aspect, but yesterday went from feeling better to burn-the-world-down mad. I am SO MAD. I hate that this has happened! I hate reading about all of you amazing women dealing with things like this! I had to stay off this thread yesterday and most of today because of how angry I am! Why does this happen??? I am reading online posts on how to have a natural miscarriage and these blogs are filled with people wanting to end healthy pregnancies... how many of us would kill to have a healthy baby! I know its not healthy to think like that, but I am starting to lose hope and this is only one miscarriage. I am trying to have the testing done on me and DH to see if anything could be wrong, I don&#39;t think I could handle this again. </p>

You might have noticed that the downvote button is gone from posts and comments (although if you use a mobile app or have custom styles turned off, you won't notice this at all). 

I've done this in an attempt to prevent the random weird downvote brigading that we've had over the past few days. The daily threads have been getting multiple downvotes right after they're posted. My guess is that people are looking at Automoderator's submission history and downvoting them, maybe due to the ""blackout"". I don't know this for sure, but it started the same day as all the Reddit drama, and I don't know why else they'd suddenly be downvoted every night.

Anyway - obviously this will make it more difficult for our actual users to downvote posts, but IMO there's not really any reason *to* downvote posts in this sub since I try to keep it heavily moderated - if you see something inappropriate, please click ""report"" instead. Clicking ""report"" does not reveal to the mods *who* reported it, so you'll remain anonymous, but it alerts us that there might be an issue with a comment.

Let me know if this style change is bothersome - if it is, I'll consider removing it once things around the site calm down a bit.

This can be through the way she (or he) coped with a hard situation, her encouragement that she passes along to others, her bravery in undergoing a certain procedure, her hope in TTC, her endurance through a rough pregnancy...etc. Our sub is such a positive, loving place so let's acknowledge some of the wonderful people who make it so. **Quick note: Comments and discussions surrounding pregnancy and loss are allowed. Proceed with caution if this is triggering to you.**

It is also a great introspective exercise to acknowledge *yourself* for something you've accomplished recently. In additional acknowledging someone else, give yourself some credit for going through such a crazy time in life and share with us what you are acknowledging yourself for. 

You are all so encouraging, wonderful ladies (and men). Let's point the spotlight at some folks who deserve recognition :)

<p>So for this get-to-know-you thread...first acknowledge someone in this sub who has been influential in some way to you. This can be through the way she (or he) coped with a hard situation, her encouragement that she passes along to others, her bravery in undergoing a certain procedure, her hope in TTC, her endurance through a rough pregnancy...etc. Our sub is such a positive, loving place so let&#39;s acknowledge some of the wonderful people who make it so. <strong>Quick note: Comments and discussions surrounding pregnancy and loss are allowed. Proceed with caution if this is triggering to you.</strong></p>

<p>It is also a great introspective exercise to acknowledge <em>yourself</em> for something you&#39;ve accomplished recently. In additional acknowledging someone else, give yourself some credit for going through such a crazy time in life and share with us what you are acknowledging yourself for. </p>

<p>You are all so encouraging, wonderful ladies (and men). Let&#39;s point the spotlight at some folks who deserve recognition :)</p>

Current location: Orange County CA. 


How long married: 3 years


How long trying: Going into cycle 10 this week. 


How many do you have / want?: We have none, we want 2-3. Badly.


(USA only I guess, sorry) What are you doing on the 4th?: Have a fun BBQ/party at our house. We live 2 blocks from the beach so it gets pretty crazy/big party scene.

What are you doing this weekend?: It's the 4th here on Saturday, so other than that and BDing, nothing!

What other things besides TTC do you want to accomplish/work on this year?: Oh man, so many things. First of all, I'm so bitter, resentful, self-loathing right now because of my weight. I've gained 30 lbs since my wedding, and my weight has always been a large issue of mine. It affects my whole daily life and relationships. I need to get it under control. It's hard. And to put myself out there more. My husband is so social, thrill seeking, fun, active, and I'm just... a hermit. I do almost nothing, he goes out all the time, and I end up getting annoyed and resentful. I'm going to work on that. I'm going to put the effort in, hop the back of his bike a lot more, and just do fun stuff. finally, I just want to be happier. And this all ties into that! 



How are you feeling about TTC?: I feel differently often. Most of the time I'm pissed and frustrated that it hasn't just happened easily, other times, like after I babysit my friends or sister's kids, I feel like ""alright, my life w/o kids isn't so bad, kids are so much to deal with, maybe I will be okay, I get to drop these kids off, go home and take a nap w/o abandon"", but that doesn't last long and I'm back to yearning. Most of all I yearn so much to build a family, to gain more love w/in our small group of dwindling family members. Have great holidays, see my husband's parents become grandparents, see my husband become a father, see what we create, have a large purpose in life. So many reasons.

I was directed here from /r/tryingforababy and am very happy to have found you..

I am 28, married for 5 years and have a lovely son who will turn 5 in autumn. 

For the past year, starting in August, we have been trying for #2, and, like with my first pregnancy, I got pregnant the first cycle. Unfortunately, a week after I tested positive, I started bleeding heavily, and lost the baby. I luckily didn't have to get any tissue removed and passed it naturally. When I think back to it now, I feels so distant, I think it's quite a suppressed memory, and I really fell into a hole, but somehow made it out. 

We started trying again in December and again, pregnant the first cycle. I was very very cautious in the beginning and did not quite allow myself to truly believe it, but it was all so real. I tested the Sunday before Christmas, by new years my boobs were 2 sizes bigger, my whole body was changing. Due to the holidays I could only see my doc in January. He did not find an embryo, only an empty sac. He initially told me not to worry too much as it was very early on and my ovulation date might have been a bit off, but the next week I went back and it was still empty. After another week of waiting he recommended a d&c. I got a second opinion, but at some point I had to accept that there wasn't really a baby inside me. So end of January I got the d&c which wasn't as bad as I thought (general anaesthetics rock.) and I kept myself super busy since. 

In March we decided to try again and are still waiting for something to happen.

I read somewhere about how there might be a problem with super-fertility regarding miscarriages, and I think that that's maybe what happened to me. 
So on the one hand, I am ""glad"" I haven't fallen pregnant again, that maybe this time my body is waiting for a viable pregnancy, on the other hand I want to be pregnant so bad.

<p>I was directed here from <a href=""/r/tryingforababy"">/r/tryingforababy</a> and am very happy to have found you..</p>

<p>I am 28, married for 5 years and have a lovely son who will turn 5 in autumn. </p>

<p>For the past year, starting in August, we have been trying for #2, and, like with my first pregnancy, I got pregnant the first cycle. Unfortunately, a week after I tested positive, I started bleeding heavily, and lost the baby. I luckily didn&#39;t have to get any tissue removed and passed it naturally. When I think back to it now, I feels so distant, I think it&#39;s quite a suppressed memory, and I really fell into a hole, but somehow made it out. </p>

<p>We started trying again in December and again, pregnant the first cycle. I was very very cautious in the beginning and did not quite allow myself to truly believe it, but it was all so real. I tested the Sunday before Christmas, by new years my boobs were 2 sizes bigger, my whole body was changing. Due to the holidays I could only see my doc in January. He did not find an embryo, only an empty sac. He initially told me not to worry too much as it was very early on and my ovulation date might have been a bit off, but the next week I went back and it was still empty. After another week of waiting he recommended a d&amp;c. I got a second opinion, but at some point I had to accept that there wasn&#39;t really a baby inside me. So end of January I got the d&amp;c which wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought (general anaesthetics rock.) and I kept myself super busy since. </p>

<p>In March we decided to try again and are still waiting for something to happen.</p>

<p>I read somewhere about how there might be a problem with super-fertility regarding miscarriages, and I think that that&#39;s maybe what happened to me. 
So on the one hand, I am &quot;glad&quot; I haven&#39;t fallen pregnant again, that maybe this time my body is waiting for a viable pregnancy, on the other hand I want to be pregnant so bad. There is so much baby talk everywhere, first and second babies are arriving, and I am just sitting amidst all that, not even being able to talk about what I have been trough in the past year. People keep asking me about when #2 is coming along, and how we shouldn&#39;t wait for much longer. </p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s me and my story. Sorry for the wall of text :) Can&#39;t wait to meet you all!</p>

I found out I was pregnant a the weekend before last. I'd taken a test but thrown it out before I had the chance to read the result (I was pretty pessimistic).

Everything went fine at the appointment, I had bloods taken and was sent for a cautionary ultrasound. The doctor estimated me to be between 6 and 7 weeks, but the ultrasound showed (what I now know to be two) sack(s) but nothing within them.


I promised myself I wouldn't get excited until I knew everything was fine. But I was absolutely devastated when it happened. I passed a little one on the day of the ultrasound and another the next day (after I'd given a second set of bloods which confirmed decreasing hcg). 


The shock of finding out I was pregnant hadn't even set, and finding out I was going to have twins after losing them hurts so much. I don't wish these feelings on anyone else.

Today won't be my clearest grammar and writing so sorry about that, please don't point out errors unless they make whole thing to lose its sense. Atleast grammatical tenses are most likely complete mess. I'll put some paragraphing so you can avoid parts that are too much for you. I know most of this isn't easies thing to read.

First about what happened, this is propably the heavies part to read so skip it if detailed description of MC are too much for you, I'll bold small part of the text when it stops detailing birth process:

Everything happened so fast. As I have been telling in alumni thread, I had strong Braxton Hicks / contractions since last tuesday. I visited ER and everything was fine, hematoma was going away and that caused contractions. They said I shouldn't worry too much about them in this case. Saturday evening there was contractions once again and guess they were real one. Just before midnight my water broke. I even heard the sound or atleast I think I heard. I immediately went to bathroom to lay on the floor and husband called 112. While I have been whining about our living situation and my BIL living with us, this time it was god sent thing. We just said to him that ambulance is coming, here is dog, kid is sleeping, please call MIL and FIL to take care of our daughter.

Ambulance came in few minutes and same time I started to bleed. I haven't been actually bleeding last week, just clotting and more liquid hematoma discharge but no actual bleeding. There was huge clots and they had to get me to chair to get me downstairs before chair could had been inserted to bed mode. They carried me to ambulance and drove to hospital. Husband followed us and was ready on ER door when we got there. At ER my only thought was that this is very painful and I'm no way going to push, I could still feel him kicking, I think that was the last time. Then they started to move me to maternity ward but while we were waiting for elevator, I felt how contraction also brought my little babys head out and in elevator he was born. Until that moment, I had somehow believed that miracle could happend and we wouldn't lose this one but then I completely broke down. It wasn't crying, it was howling and screaming. Some of you have propably seen Game of Thrones and heard Catelyn at Red Wedding. Well that was me. Husband said that 20 years from this and he will still see nightmares of that sound and my face. Personally there is very blurry part after that but we got to our room and placenta came out. We got to hold him in our arms then. From water breaking to having him in my arms was no more than 45 minutes.

**Why** this happened and how I'm feeling about this? (this section will explain reasons behind MC and other medical stuff but not really about birth process):
So worst case scenario had happened. All this is still bit speculation since autopsy results will take some time. Bacteria, propably from vagina had gotten to cervix while hematoma had kept cervix bit open and then from there to remaining hematoma and uterus. Placenta had strong signs of infection and that had cause labour to start. What makes this comforting is that there was nothing we could have done. Going to ER few hours or days earlier and noticing that my [CRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein) was rising wouldn't have helped, even if I would have eaten antibiotics every day of my pregnancy wouldn't have helped. They wouldn't have affected inside the uterus enough. It's truly a good thing. I can't blame myself, not husband, doctor, some sick person who I accidentally saw since it was most likely normal vaginal bacteria in wrong place.

**About** Uljas, his name and himself:

Uljas Onni Tapani is his name. We had been debating for two totally different name combinations lately. Uljas had been our favourite but there was another strong candidate. Issue with Uljas was that directly translated, Uljas means Chivalry, from one of our favourite books, Robin Hobbs Farseer series. Her big sister also has her third name from those books. Back to Uljas. Uljas also is the name they use Prince Charming in childrens books and fairytales, so there was kinda big risk that he would have been teased about being prince Uljas and asked when he is going to save some princesses. This in unfortunate solution but now no one will make fun of that name, although I can't watch any of those movies with finnish dubs for a while.

Onni is also my grandfathers name who died over 20 years ago. While I was only 9 when he died, somehow he has always been role model of pure love. While my other grandparents, parents and some other people love me, Onni was loving me like you love your own kid, with no conditions. Since he also hadn't deal with my less desirable behavior, he never had to say me no, ground me or anything. Only things I received from him was love and affection. Also chocolate and motorcycle, he was old fashioned enough that it was pink motorcycle but never the less, it was real motorcycle and I loved racing with it. :) Onni also has meaning in finnish. It means happiness, luck and fortune. I think it means mostly about happiness but it can't be totally directly translated. It has been one of the most popular boy names in Finland for last few years and I was bit upset about it since one of my idea was that it would have been first name.

Tapani is my husbands second name and we wanted to have part of him too with our little son. There is nothing else really to explain about it.

Uljas as our baby was small, beautiful, perfect little thing. 264g and 23cm. He was so tiny and had those long little fingers and everything in him was just as it was supposed to be.

**Future:** Now we are waiting for autopsy results. Since whole Finland pretty much closes down during July, it will propably take month. After that we will bury him. Today I talked in facebook with my friend who I have know since highschool. He was the priest at our weddings and at our daughters babtism and I had already asked him to do that once again after this baby would be born. I told him that I'd like him to take care of the funerals also but I'd undestand if it would be too much, even said that I couldn't personally do that to any close friends or family of mine and left him way to say no. Well, he still said yes and we will talk again after we get permit from hospital to bury him.

I have been feeling up and down and still in shock I guess. Writing and talking seems to help. Morning was worst since when I woke up, I was still living in that other reality and had to remind myself that I'm not pregnant anymore. Got some sleeping pills and they really work, slept 10 hours straight.

I don't know if it's too much for some people to talk about this thing in TTC threads but I guess I'm going to unless someone asks me to stop. It's okay, I know these thing aren't easy to talk. We are propably starting to try after all testings and funeral are done. I think they wanted to do one test where we have to wait for 3 months before hormon levels are normal enough, something about coagulation (ffs this online dictionary sucks with medical terms, had to translate throuh wikipedia). It is routine test to do for miscarriages after first trimester so they aren't exactly suspecting anything wrong there but just want to test. 3 months also sounds like proper time to mourn and wait for periods. Although doctor said that if accidents happen, they are happy accidents. Seriously I'm not ready for sex yet.

So, AMA, it actually helps to talk and questions make me think and arrange stuff in my head so don't be shy to ask details.

I understand I'm still pretty much in shock but at the moment I feel somewhat hopeful. This wasn't our fault, we can do this again and next time it will be different. Meanwhile our daughter will be our best therapist and suffer overload of hugs and kisses.

I'm sorry but I really can't follow that thread for a while atleast and I hope and think you understand it. I hope I will get back there before all of you progress from it!

We need to wait few months atleast before starting to try again to get all the test results and also of course I need to have my periods back. So after that I'll see you in TTC thread.

<p>I understand I&#39;m still pretty much in shock but at the moment I feel somewhat hopeful. This wasn&#39;t our fault, we can do this again and next time it will be different. Meanwhile our daughter will be our best therapist and suffer overload of hugs and kisses.</p>

<p>For all you lovely ladies in alumni thread. Thank you for your enormous support during this pregnancy, you were there for me at each step. I wish you all long, boring pregnancies which will end up with angrily screaming baby, or in case of <a href=""/u/pscalici"">/u/pscalici</a>, two babies in your arms. I&#39;m sorry but I really can&#39;t follow that thread for a while atleast and I hope and think you understand it. I hope I will get back there before all of you progress from it!</p>

<p>We need to wait few months atleast before starting to try again to get all the test results and also of course I need to have my periods back. So after that I&#39;ll see you in TTC thread. For you ladies there, I mean this with all the best intents, go away from there, leave it all to me and fill the alumni thread.</p>

<p>Edit: Just to add the insult, my last MC&#39;s EDD would have been in 3 days. So if this would have been perfect world, that pregnancy would had been viable and now we would have full term baby.</p>

http://babyjackandcompany.com/products/donations-to-nicus?variant=2401051139

At 18 weeks, my husband and I were having an ultrasound to find out our daughter Margaux's gender when the tech saw a bubble on her back filled with cerebrospinal fluid. We were rushed to a specialist where we found out that Margaux had Spina Bifida. We moved back to Colorado and started to see amazing doctors at Children's Hospital Colorado. After many ultrasounds and two MRIs, no one was able to tell us if her spinal cord was affected. We were told that we would not know until she was born.

On January 22, 2014 I had a scheduled C-section. We only got to see Margaux for a few seconds before she was whisked away to have MRIs and tests. At one day old, Margaux had spinal surgery to remove the bubble and to detach any of her spinal cord that had attached in the growth. We then spent five days in the NICU while Margaux recovered. For the first two days, we were not allowed to hold her and she could only lay on her stomach while her back began to heal. We still do not know how much of her spinal cord has been affected and will not know until she gets old.

I cannot even begin to put into words the amazing care we received while in the Children's Hospital Colorado NICU. We are very thankful for all the donated items we were given by volunteers. We received blankets for Margaux and other items for my husband and me. Having these items really made the NICU stay more comfortable.

This is why I have teamed up with the Baby Jack & Co to #spreadthelovey. Baby Jack creates amazing security blankets for babies and children. I want to give the same comfort we received in the NICU to parents and babies currently in the NICU at Children's Hospital Colorado. For a donation of $18, you buy a blanket for a family that is in the NICU. Margaux and I will hand deliver the blankets to the families. 

Thank you so much!

For those who are interested, I'm happy to detail a little bit more of my HSG experience, especially because it was the second one I've had; I can fairly confidently say that I'm an HSG expert at this point.  

I had this HSG at a different hospital slightly closer to my home with a different doctor in my practice.  Husband was allowed back in the radiology suite with me this time, which was a huge relief.  (The hospital I went to last time didn't allow him in the room with me.) I took 800 mg of ibuprofen (4 pills!) before this test, compared with 400 mg before my first HSG, and it made a HUGE difference.  HUGE.  Granted, I have birthed a baby, said goodbye, undergone a D&C under only general anesthetic, endured a ton of fertility appointments, and taken two shots of methotrexate in the butt sine then, so perhaps my tolerance for pain is a bit higher, but I remember very very clearly how painful my first HSG was and it still tops the list.  I remember feeling sore/achy all that night and tender into the next day, and right now I feel absolutely nothing - I'm perfectly fine.  

I will say that this procedure took a tiny bit longer than the last one I had, which I will chalk up to the technique and demeanor of a different doctor.  He was a bit more methodical and step-by-step but explained everything so clearly as he went as opposed to just trying to get me in and out quickly.  I was able to spend a good bit more time checking out my uterus and my tubes filling with the iodine and watching it spill out this time, which was pretty darn cool, too.  Having the hubs there made it all the better.  

The best part of the day is that the radiology tech who took care of me today happens to be someone I know.  I see this gal once a year at the annual Philly Area Corgi Picnic (yup, that's a thing, and it's amazing!) and she works at the hospital where I went today.  Apparently she saw my name on the schedule and was excited to make sure she had me all to herself, since she knows my whole story.  Having a familiar hand to hold aside form my husband's was also awesome.  

So, my advice to anyone else in this community who may need an HSG after an ectopic or as the start of fertility treatment: load up heavy on the Advil (800 mg) and get a little pushy about having someone in the room with you for support.

Tell me that's not a tiny gestational sac, right? What are the things they marked? What is the white line by my endometrium? Are those my measurements and are those measurements okay for my cycle (CD22 9DPO)?

There are 2 boxes, both with 20 tests within. The boxes HAVE been opened in order to check the expiry date, however each test is individually sealed.

The expiry date is 08/2016 so still tons of time to use them.

I'm looking for 2 people (within Canada to avoid huge shipping costs) who are in need of the tests; as my wife and I were lucky enough to not need all of them.

I'm not looking for money for them, and this isn't some sort of marketing scheme; I just want some people who otherwise couldn't afford them to benefit from them.

I'll pick 2 people on June 18th at 8PM PST using random.org to get the tests.
