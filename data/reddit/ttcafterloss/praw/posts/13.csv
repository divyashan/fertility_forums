I lost my first baby in August, 2 weeks before my birthday. It was a missed miscarriage that was discovered at 12 weeks, just a couple of days before we were going to announce our pregnancy. The ultrasound tech's best guess is that the baby died at 9 weeks. 

My husband and I have been doing our best to cope with this loss. It took us almost 2 years to conceive and our faith has taken a major blow. 

Are there any good resources in the Phoenix, AZ  area for us? We took a couple months away from church and have been reevaluating our faith. We met with our pastor this last week and it was just awful. 

He didn't really have anything comforting to say or advice to give us; even though I'm sure he meant well. I thought I was doing better with this whole thing but just about everything he said twisted the knife in my heart. I don't remember everything he said but I was crying most of the time. He also rebuked me for not seeking guidance or counseling with ladies in our church. 

This whole week I've just been thinking about what I could have done better to not have lost my baby. We've come to the conclusion that it was truly a genetic abnormality (the baby never grew as big as it should have and stopped developing at 9 weeks) Some days I can think about it and I'm okay. Other days I just want to smash things and I hate everyone and everything. I vacillate between depression and hate and despair and other days I can stay busy enough to not think about it. I think I should probably seek counseling but I don't know where to look. I don't think I want to go back to church right now but I think I need help. 

My husband and I had another talk about trying again. I really do want a baby of my own but I'm scared that I'll just lose another and I don't think I could survive that. It's been hard enough already and I don't think I'm emotionally stable enough to try again. I can't even be intimate with my husband anymore. 

Sorry for the ramble, I just don't know what to do anymore. My husband does everything he can for me and he doesn't deserve my misery and emotional instability piled on top of his own grief. He's talked to a few men in our church that have been through miscarriages with their wives and he seemed to benefit from it. I talked to my best friend who had a miscarriage and a false pregnancy and now has two beautiful little boys. It helps some days and other days I just feel like I'm drowning.

My husband and I went to visit her, BIL, niece, and nephew the other day and I wanted to make a cheesecake to bring. Knowing lemon bars are my SIL's favorite dessert, I decided to experiment with the recipe and grossly underestimated the time I needed so we just grabbed ice cream sundae stuff on the way. I felt like ""Well I made this for them, so I should give it to them"" I brought the cheesecake anyway un-set telling them I thought it just needed to chill but maybe not because of the experimenting.  

Anyway, while we were there she mentioned she wanted to get two feather tattoos, I asked if it was to represent her children. She told me feathers represent loss and they would be for the ""miscarriage and the *a-word*"" I asked if she had names for them or if she just called them that. She told me that they just used those words because (paraphrasing) ""Even though they were a loss, it's not like I need names for them. I know (other friend) named her MCs but she doesn't have any real kids."" 

**I. Was. Shocked.** 

I didn't know how to respond at all, still recovering from my MC (She doesn't know about it, I was just shy of 9 weeks) And our friend in question had very late miscarriages, one was a stillborn. For SIL to dismiss her pain (and my own unintentionally) really took me by surprise. I mumbled something about the friend being very far along and just changed the subject. 

Today, I decided to stop avoiding her since she clearly didn't mean to hurt me, and I asked her if the cheesecake ever set and how it was. She told me it hadn't set and started questioning me about how I made it trying to figure out where I made my mistake. Then she sent me a bunch of recipes and explained the way I should make a lemon cheesecake for it to be correct. I don't know why but this really bugged me. She's trying to help but I'm clearly not over the other night. I think my subconscious said something like *""Yah... she's better at making babies... and cheesecakes!""*

I was active duty navy, she was a pre-school teacher, we met on e-harmony while I was off the coast of Somalia hunting pirates. We spoke for six months online, met for the first time in December, got engaged on Valentine's Day, and Married at the end of May in 2012. We've been married now for three years and we tried to have a baby right off the bat.

It's not that we can't conceive.....

We were pregnant in 2013, not too quickly but quick enough. We were so excited, we waited for just a little while and told everyone! We miscarried the baby at 9 weeks in January. We didn't know the gender, so we just named the baby ""Hope"", in the hopes that the next one would come right after.

We tried for TWO YEARS to conceive again, but it just wasn't happening. We started to seriously consider adoption as an alternative. Then we found out we were pregnant again! WOOO!!! Were we EXCITED! We progressed, no problems, everything was going great. His name was Thorin Seth (Thorin from Thorin Oakenshield in The Hobbit...but it means ""thunder"". And Seth because it means ""Appointed"". Together, they mean ""Thunderous Appointment""). We're both very dedicated Christians and have been praying for this baby for for literally years. On September 14th at 3 in the morning, Thorin was delivered, two weeks early (because we had gone to the hospital because we didn't feel him moving). He had the cord wrapped around his neck three times. 7 pounds and 13 ounces and 20 inches long. We prayed for what seemed like days (really just about a day straight).

He was only two weeks from seeing the world, just two weeks. For three years we've been trying to have this baby...and he's gone. So. Here we are. Trying to pick up the pieces...again. It's not that we can't conceive, it's that we've lost two babies in three years, have acquired thousands in hospital bills that we can't afford, and we've got....nothing. Nothing to show for it. We miss our baby boy, and while we're grieving uncontrollably, I do feel that we're stronger than most people would be in this circumstance. We've got our witts about us, we're strong and capable. But every day, it hurts and I don't think I'll ever forget this feeling. We think we want to wait six months before trying again...we just hope that her cycle fixes itself this time and doesn't take two more years of trying to get it right. If you pray, we'd really appreciate your prayers.

One of the things we're trying to keep holding on to most is our own sanity. While some people might find it's OK to do some of these things, us personally, we want to keep reality real here. We lost our baby, we won't be carrying around a teddy bear that weighs the same as our baby 'would' have weighed, we won't keep his ashes with us.

I can't say that I would've ever imagined what this would be like. All my life I'd heard that someone had a miscarriage, but never understood it until we had one. I've HEARD the word 'stillbirth', but I've never known anyone EVER who had one....until we had one. I did know one person, they aren't close to us, but they're close to some of our close friends.

Before I begin, I just wanted to say what a wonderful, caring community this seems to be. I am very lucky to have stumbled on this peaceful place when I did. 

My husband and I lost our first baby on July 22 of this year, somewhere in the 13 week of my pregnancy. Devastation ensued, since we had just announced our pregnancy a week earlier. According to all the research, we should have been in the clear. Unfortunately, as many of us know, statistics don't always work in our favor. 

Because I was almost through with my first trimester, my doctor performed a D&C on July 27. Everything went well, until about five days later, when I started bleeding very heavily and throwing large clots. At the urging of my husband, we went to the ER. They found my uterus full of blood and material, and scheduled another D&C for the following morning. I spent the night in the labor and delivery section of the hospital, listening to other mothers giving birth to their healthy children. No amount of morphine that night could dull the ache in my heart.

August 2 was my second D&C. The doctor was almost done with the procedure, when he found a small piece of tissue close to my cervix. It would not come off with suction, so he had to use forceps in order to get it detached. He then scraped my walls, just to make sure all the tissue had been removed.

My recovery has gone well, but unfortunately, almost 10 weeks after the second D&C, I have still not had a period. I saw my doctor yesterday, and he suggested waiting another month or two to see if my body would naturally get back into rhythm. As a woman who was always regular before losing the baby, I am befuddled by my body right now, as well as very frustrated because we cannot even begin to think about TTC again since I am obviously not ovulating. 

My pregnancy was difficult because I had a 10 cm cyst on my right ovary that was causing me constant pain. But we thought we were in the clear because of having so many positive ultrasounds. I loved hearing the heartbeat over and over, and seeing our little nugget wiggle around inside me. A routine ultrasound to check on the cyst turned into a nightmare, which seems to be unending at this point. 

Luckily, the cyst is down to 4-5 cm now, and looks to be completely benign. 

What I am hoping to hear is that I am not alone in this struggle for my body to heal, that others have had similar experiences and gone on to ovulate again. I am terrified of the slim chance that I have scar tissue in my uterus from the D&C and will now be infertile. 

Any words of wisdom or advice would be greatly appreciated. I just keep telling myself to breathe, because that's all I can seem to do to keep myself sane at the moment.

I have been lurking and commented yesterday for the first time. This is my intro: I honestly dont know how they are supposed to look and how much information needs to be shared. I would say this could be a trigger (I think I would cry, but I cry a lot when it comes to miscarriage and unsuccessfully getting pregnant). 

So my fiance and I decided to try for a baby last September. That very first month, I was pregnant. I was so underjoyed (I didnt realize that a miscarriage was even possible for me, and as such didnt really live out the short moment I wish had). I wish I would have shouted it and expressed it (hindsight). Two months later in November I start spotting and I call the nurse and she assures me I am probably fine and its nothing. Come the next morning, I am now spotting much more. Never had I ever wished for something more. I was hoping this was nothing and that I was fine. 

I decide to call into work and tell them I have to see my doctor and I would be in soon. I go in and they do an ultrasound then, I remember asking the tech is everything okay, does it look good, etc. She simply said that doctor would talk to me. I knew something was wrong then. The doctor came in and asked me when my last period was to really confirm the dates. I tell her and then ask why. She tells me that she was hoping I was wrong about my dates and that I am just 6 weeks along. But I wasnt just 6 weeks along, I was at 10. This is when we are told that I am going to have a miscarriage and that I had a blighted ovum. 

I remember just breaking down right then. I had no clue what any of this meant. Needless to say, later that night I had a miscarriage. And for the next months life sucked. Still does but for slightly different reason (cant get pregnant to save my life).

Nothing prepares you for this. Nothing. I felt very alone and ashamed. (a lot of my friends have kids and I felt like I didnt belong).

We talked to the doctor more and she said it happens and what not. I asked when can we start again and she said wait a couple of months, so we did. Started in February again and nothing since. I dont know if anyone else does this but, I had months where I tried a variety of things. I call them my being good months (prenatals, good food, no caffeine, no alcohol, only good for getting pregnant stuff) and when those months werent successful I turned to the dark side, my being bad months (drinking caffiene, having a little alcohol, eating salami, etc) that didnt work either. Then I did the chill months (doing my normal thing, whatever I really feel like doing, but being good), that didnt work either. I feel like some weird scientist that is trying to find the correct formula for getting pregnant again. Its silly, really. I sometimes feel like other people have found this formula that I cant nail for some reason. Idk. 

Anyways, thats me. So far I have commented once, and received nice replies. I feel like this is a place where I can express myself and my true feelings (not this strong woman who preservers and is resilient). So thank you for that.

Visited the OB today for more follow up. I saw a different doctor who was extremely patient and decided we needed more than a blood test to determine what was going on. He did an u/s but it was inconclusive to him - he said he could see fluid pooling in (and maybe around) my uterus and possibly within the Fallopian tube. He admitted that he thought it would be better to get me to a radiologist to have a thorough u/s to determine where to go from here.

Ultrasound has been done, and I just heard from the radiologist. The fluid that was visible on u/s was blood and only within the uterus - none in the Fallopian tube. All of the tissue from my miscarriage has passed, which explains the intense cramping and bleeding I had yesterday and this morning. The fluid around the uterus was likely just swelling - no sign of internal bleeding. 

It's been a physically and emotionally exhausting few days, and it took some time to get resolved, but we got there eventually. I do have to follow up next week, and take a pregnancy test in a couple weeks to be sure everything has cleared my system. I am hopeful and ready to move forward.

Friday, I visited urgent care because I was having spotting and it was outside my OB's hours. It was the day after my first OB appointment, which was the day I was 10w.  The appointment  entailed family history and labs, but no u/s. The doctor on call ordered an u/s, and they reported seeing a gestational sac with no baby. They did a blood draw for HCG, and I left with instructions to do another blood draw on Monday to compare HCG levels again. The weekend was difficult, but my husband and I spent a lot of time talking and working through it with family and friends. We were on our way to accepting it; heartbroken but hopeful for the future. 

Today at my appointment, my OB did another u/s to see how much tissue remained - I'd been bleeding since Friday. The sac was still there, but he said he may see a placenta and some development. It was not measuring anywhere near the 11w I should be close to, but something was visible. He also described seeing a potential second sac, and how it could have been the reason for my bleeding. At this point, I am highly doubtful (to put it lightly); he ordered another HCG lab to compare my levels to Monday's, and said he would call me tonight. 

I looked at my phone a few minutes ago and saw I had a missed call and voicemail from my OB. My phone never rang. The voicemail said they would call tomorrow since they missed me. I tried calling back, but it's already after hours and it went straight to voicemail. I feel like I've been hanging on by a thread all day, and missing that call was the thread breaking. I can't stop crying and I feel so hopeless. 

Besides leaving the appointment with more questions, I left with no idea what was happening in my body. Am I pregnant? I don't know. If I am, he said it probably wouldn't be a successful pregnancy. I'm not getting my hopes up because everything I'm feeling says I'm not pregnant anymore. I've accepted that. If anything I'm angry, because I left the appointment with ""possible miscarriage"" and ""threatened miscarriage,"" and without any confirmation. I do not do well in limbo. I get frustrated that there is something between pregnant and not pregnant, and I'm there.

So my last miscarriage at 10.5 weeks was very traumatic.  I was in my home state at my in-laws when I actually ended up miscarrying.  Physical recovery was kind of rougher than I would have anticipated, and I had retained products which I did not know at the time.  Two days after our loss, on a Sunday, I was napping with my son and trying to physically recover when my MIL decides to give my husband an ultimatum when they were going out to lunch that if we were not going to let my son go to church with them, we were not welcome at their house on Sundays.

Their church and the family has a long complicated history and sordid backstory, and the take home is that my son is not allowed to go.

So next week will be my first trip back since my Christmas miscarriage, my almost three-year-old son is coming, and husband can't go.  Had that conversation not happened, I would have gone on Sunday afternoon and stayed until Wednesday morning, but clearly that's not happening.  So I'm going to go Monday late afternoon/early evening and stay until Wednesday morning.

Now MIL is depressed and saying to my husband that she's only going to see her grandson for a day and her comment is understandably coming back to haunt her.  I would have thought it would have been pretty obvious that to put limits on the days of our brief trips would have meant she would get less grandson time, but I guess she thought we would bend to the ultimatum, and that's not happening.

My husband said don't feel obligated, it's entirely up to me, but it might go a long way to placate them by letting our son stay with them for a day.  If we were at my house, I would do so without hesitation.  But I don't trust them on their ""turf"".  The best day to leave him would be Wednesday, and again, that's a church day for them, so that's out.  

They could come pick him up on another day, but...I just don't know.  I guess I worry that I'll have problems getting them to bring him back, and that they will try to pile on the guilt, and I feel like I'm already going to get that anyway when I'm there.  I feel like they are welcome to join me and my family, but I don't know if I want them to take him by himself to their home at this point.

I want to check with others.  Because my concern is that part of my rationale might be that I want them to feel the consequences of their decision to have this conversation, particularly the decision to have this conversation two days after we lost a child.  (No apology to my husband by the way.)  

Am I being too firm on this?  Is there a compromise?  Is them coming to my parents' house enough of a compromise?

It's going to be hard enough going back to those memories, especially without my husband's support (and he is sad he can't go for our friend's wedding, but he doesn't get any vacation days at work until he works in the position for a year, which will be June).

Seeking honest opinions.  This is about my living child, so please don&#39;t read if it will be triggering.</p>

<p>So my last miscarriage at 10.5 weeks was very traumatic.  I was in my home state at my in-laws when I actually ended up miscarrying.  Physical recovery was kind of rougher than I would have anticipated, and I had retained products which I did not know at the time.  Two days after our loss, on a Sunday, I was napping with my son and trying to physically recover when my MIL decides to give my husband an ultimatum when they were going out to lunch that if we were not going to let my son go to church with them, we were not welcome at their house on Sundays.</p>

<p>Their church and the family has a long complicated history and sordid backstory, and the take home is that my son is not allowed to go.</p>

<p>So next week will be my first trip back since my Christmas miscarriage, my almost three-year-old son is coming, and husband can&#39;t go.  Had that conversation not happened, I would have gone on Sunday afternoon and stayed until Wednesday morning, but clearly that&#39;s not happening.  So I&#39;m going to go Monday late afternoon/early evening and stay until Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Now MIL is depressed and saying to my husband that she&#39;s only going to see her grandson for a day and her comment is understandably coming back to haunt her.  I would have thought it would have been pretty obvious that to put limits on the days of our brief trips would have meant she would get less grandson time, but I guess she thought we would bend to the ultimatum, and that&#39;s not happening.</p>

<p>My husband said don&#39;t feel obligated, it&#39;s entirely up to me, but it might go a long way to placate them by letting our son stay with them for a day.  If we were at my house, I would do so without hesitation.  But I don&#39;t trust them on their &quot;turf&quot;.  The best day to leave him would be Wednesday, and again, that&#39;s a church day for them, so that&#39;s out.  </p>

The run down: yesterday (7DPO) I got a positive, or pretty much (see pic http://imgur.com/LGvPCmu)
my O date previous was confirmed by temps on FF. even though i still wasn't sure, this is my first cycle following a CP so it felt a bit off. but the dates were right i had the same opain as normal, temp rise and EWCM but had seemingly missed my LH surge. now 7 days later, pos OPK. not sure what that means. just wondering if anyone else has been here before.
is it possible i O'd a bag egg and my body is trying again? or maybe the egg didnt quite kick, but then why the temp change?
i know its not one of those im pregnant thing and that caused it, its too early to have enough HGC to turn an OPK positive.
just wondering if any of you ladies have been here.
maybe my temp spike which was small was just misintererated by FF and i actually didnt O and now i really am?
Thoughts and advice welcome! TIA

I really thought I would get pregnant this cycle because of 
 
 - My doctor's encouragement that post MC because my hormones would be elevated

 - We BDed approx 20 times in the last 3 weeks since we didn't know when I would ovulate. 

 - It was easy to get pregnant the first time. 

Got some horrible cramps today, reminiscent of when I first got pregnant and was mildly excited. Went to the bathroom. 

Blood. 

Well. Shit. 

At least husband is taking me out for tacos tonight. I will drown my sorrow in horchata and eat all the chips and salsa!

Edit: You ladies who go through this monthly.... I don't even know how. I respect you.

<p>Well. Shit. </p>

<p>At least husband is taking me out for tacos tonight. I will drown my sorrow in horchata and eat all the chips and salsa!</p>

<p>Edit: You ladies who go through this monthly.... I don&#39;t even know how. I respect you. </p>

<p>Edit #2: My Mexican Food place was taken over by new management a couple months ago. It has steadily gotten worse. Today I decided to start looking for a new place. Or complain. Blergh. Chips and salsa should not come in tiny bowls. </p>
