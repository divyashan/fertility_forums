He was all ""No, you mean the three week wait"". Wait, what? He wants me to wait until I'm a week late to test!

I told him no way. I will agree to wait until my period is actually due but a whole week?

It's because of what happened last time, he doesn't want it to happen again. Last time I tested on 11dpo (approx, because I wasn't tracking ovulation) and got a negative. Tested again at 14dpo/period due date and got a squinter. Next day another squinter but strong symptoms. DH was unhappy I was repeatedly testing so because of the symptoms, I agreed to wait. Was not until 1 week late that I got a strong positive, but this turned out to be an early miscarriage. HCG only ever got to 3-4 week levels even though I was 6 weeks by dates.

I was fine with all of the testing and just curious, in fact I would have liked to have done the testing every day to see a progression, but he wasn't happy with that and didn't want me to. As I was getting strong symptoms I decided I wouldn't test for a few more days because he was so antsy about it. But it hasn't put me off testing early! And I definitely want to test when my period is due. Especially since it will be my birthday <pout> He reckons I *agreed* to wait to test until I'm a week late but I don't remember agreeing to this, nor can I imagine myself doing so. He also cited the fact that my cycles vary by up to 5-7 days anyway. Which is true, but since I use an app which calculates the average, I'm only ever 3 days late according to the app anyway. And by the app, I might even be 3 days late by the time it tells me I'm due!

Hmm. I don't know what I think about it. Maybe he has a point? I feel like he's squashing all the fun out of TTC for me :( The charts and tests and stuff is exciting. I am a stats geek. And I also feel like the faint positives after they should have been darker was a useful hint that something wasn't quite right and helped temper my expectations whereas a strong positive at 7 days late wouldn't tell me anything either way. I feel like the fact I was aware of what was happening with my body really helped me to cope with my miscarriage.

The other thing I thought is I'm temping now anyway, so I should have a good idea of whether I'm pregnant or not based on whether my temps drop at the end of this cycle or stay up, and I could maybe agree to test (or not) based on those? What do you think?

Oh and one last point - cheap tests are hard to find here (Germany) and the internet ones I had were absolutely rubbish and really difficult to read so I ended up spending money on proper ones and even the own brand tests are about €5+ each with clearblue etc being €7+ and digitals over €10.

This was treated with methotrexate at the end of the month and everything went fine.  Emotionally, it was of course devastating.  We were told to not try again until 3 months were up due to the MTX injections.  AF came back normally at the end of April, and was surprisingly easy and non-painful.

We were careful when intimate.  AF ended up several days late at the end of May, I thought that maybe my cycle was still messed from everything that had happened.  I was not feeling the same symptoms as last time I was pregnant. Had some epic cramping (and one major, doubled-over pain on my left side occurrence) and bloating last week and thought AF must be any day now. Took a pregnancy test for the hell of it on Tuesday this week... BFP.  

I wasn't even excited.  I immediately started crying.  It didn't feel right.  I must have conceived while still in the ""no-no"" window from the MTX and that was my first concern.  Then I remembered my pain from last week, and my gut tells me this is ectopic again. 

Told my husband about it straight out when he got home that evening.  No magic or fun surprises there... and while he is very excited, I had to keep telling him that it might not end well again. 

Had my HCG levels taken the following day.  Definitely pregnant, but my levels are only at 440 for being roughly 5 weeks.  Nurse is concerned it is low, but I go back later today to get redrawn to see if they double.  I don't have any hope, though.  They are very good about staying on top of this, knowing about my last EP... but they won't do an ultrasound until my HCG reaches 2000.  I don't have high hopes that it will reach that in time for me to get some peace of mind.

I don't want to go through another EP.  Mentally I don't think I can do it.  Last time I was so withdrawn from everyone after it happened.  Thanks to my sister-in-law, I am a first-time aunt as of last October... I cannot bring myself to see my niece or my SIL.  I couldn't even be around a baby.  I also had/have this irrational intense jealousy of my SIL for getting pregnant on her very first cycle and having a beautiful, complication-free pregnancy.

I was starting to get out again, and be social, and wanting to see my niece and then this happens and I know I will spiral back down.  I don't know how much patience they all have for me.  I know my husband got a bit short with me yesterday after I got off the phone with the nurse.  He says I am being too negative about it.  But I know my body... I know something isn't right.  This is so deeply personal, it's hard to get him to understand.

So, that is where I am at.  I guess this afternoon when I get the results of my second HCG draw, we'll have a better picture of what's going on.  I'm just having a hard time trusting my body.

Edit: HCG quant shows it doubled appropriately to 950, but the nurse still kept saying it was low for how far along I should be.  Doc will take a look and he'll schedule an ultrasound hopefully for early next week.  The pain I had last week is still a concern, but hopefully this little bean is where it's supposed to be.

This was treated with methotrexate at the end of the month and everything went fine.  Emotionally, it was of course devastating.

<p>We were careful when intimate.  AF ended up several days late at the end of May, I thought that maybe my cycle was still messed from everything that had happened.  I was not feeling the same symptoms as last time I was pregnant.

My first was 11 years ago.  I was late but kept getting negative pregnancy tests.  I finally went to the doctor, got a urine test, and she said I was pregnant.  That night, I started cramping and ended up miscarrying. I was sad, but I bounced back quickly.

9 years later, without trying, I got pregnant and had a daughter.  Once she was born, I wanted another (or really 4 or 5 more, but I was 40 and that wasn't going to happen).  We started trying and about 5 months after my period returned, I got pregnant.

Miscarriage #2 happened then.  At about 6 weeks, I had an appointment and u/s and heard the heartbeat.  Then at 11 weeks, I had an appointment.  I had a new doctor (thanks to moving several states away).  I had had a little spotting and had called the office before the appointment, but they weren't worried as I wasn't cramping.  When I went in for that appointment, they couldn't find a heartbeat.  u/s showed the baby had stopped growing at 8 weeks.  D&C was scheduled but I had a miscarriage at home that night 

So we went back to TTC.  Got pregnant 4 months in, the first month I had used OPKs and gotten serious.  I found out I was pregnant on my due date from MC #2.  I thought that was a sign or something.  I had a little spotting around 5 weeks, but no cramping.  I went in that day and they thought everything was good (although they could not detect a heartbeat - they said that wasn't unusual that early on).  A week and a half later, I had a routine appointment scheduled but the baby had stopped growing at 5 weeks.  (That was 3 weeks ago yesterday).  I ended up doing the pills that night.

I am 42 now.  If I had my way, I would have 4 or so more kids.  I know at 42, I'll be lucky to have one more - especially with the miscarriages.  I am not dealing well with this most recent loss.  It is compounded by work stress, being lonely in this new place where we don't really have friends, and we've lost several pets (cats and horses) since moving here.  

I had a follow-up blood work deal today.  When they call with the results tomorrow, I'm going to ask for a referral to a repro specialist.

&nbsp;


I was super excited (and terrified) about my baby since I found out. That in itself was odd since I have been bouncing back and forth between not wanting and wanting children for a long time so when I found out it was overwhelming. It was my first pregnancy... I even gave him a nickname and started saying ""we"". Super excited, that was until last Thursday when I started bleeding while on vacation. Bleeding turned in to large blood clots but both trips to the ER showed him as still there. That is until this past Wednesday at the airport to come home when I had a final blood clot but this one looked different from the others... I also... felt kinda different.. This Thursday I went to the Dr for my initial appt and told them everything that happened.. Hoping that it would be the same as the trips to the random ERs and have him still with me.. but no, they confirmed that I had indeed miscarried. I had no pain or typical symptoms they say you normally have. Just felt like my period even though I'm pregnant... The image of the last blood clot came to mind after they confirmed the miscarriage and I automatically thought ""I flushed my baby down the toilet"". Not the first time I thought that since that went through my mind every time I saw a blood clot. But that thought and the image keeps crossing through my head and it's making me feel absolutely horrible.  


&nbsp;


To make matters worse my husband lost his grandfather yesterday.. So it's been a really bad week overall. And he tries to keep it bottled up so he makes sure he's strong for both of us.. That makes me feel guilty as well.. Like if I'm putting all the burden on him (although he'll deny it to the death).. It's hard since he had to leave for his grandfather and I couldn't go. 


&nbsp;


There's so many feelings of sadness, anger, and failure that I don't know how to express. I know I'm not the only one that has been through this obviously but at the same time it feels so lonely... My husband wants to try again later this year since he thinks we're ready and we can prepare better. But I'm scared... I would like to try but what if I fail again? I admire the great strength of some of the posts I have glanced over, discussing their multiple miscarriages. I don't even know if I'm strong enough for that.

This timeline is messy, so please bear with me as I am not sure if I actually have a problem or not.


*I have PCOS, was on birth control from ages 16-25; been off birth control since August 2014: periods are regular, moderately painful cramping, and getting heavier between Aug 15 and Jan 16

*Pregnancy Jan 30 2015

*Missed miscarriage at 9 weeks, only showing 4 weeks growth. 

*Prescribed misoprostol vaginally in late March 2015, but continued to have positive pregnancy tests (I wanted to wait it out and avoid DNC, that did not happen)

*DNC in June 2015: periods are very light, but regular

*In June my husband moves 2hrs away, so we start trying again in Sept 2015 on weekends, which did not always coincide with my ovulation schedule, with the occasional midweek visit

*March 2016 old house is sold, I move in with husband again


Here we are almost in June, one year since my DNC, my periods are further apart than they were when I stopped birth control (29 days to now 33-35 days). I believe I may have had a chemical last month as I was getting faint + lines on days 30-32, but were gone days 33-34 when I started my period day 34. 


Half of me is thinking ""wow a whole year since your DNC and you are still having problems"" and the other half is ""you have only been full time with your husband again for like 3 months."" 


My periods are still VERY light now, but I am having them. I am not experiencing very painful cramps like I used to, so I do not believe there are any complications from the DNC. All my followups and blood work were normal.

Obviously I've had 3 miscarriages, so that would be enough of a reason. But also my cycles have been way out of whack. It seems that I have a progesterone issue, but I didn't know it because I've been on birth control for so long. So off to the specialist...

I was truly hoping he'd say, ""Yeah progesterone is your issue. That's why you miscarried, its why your cycles are wonky, and we can fix it. Woo hoo!""  (Ok I doubted he'd say woo hoo, but progesterone ALONE is super easy to supplement so the rest was a fair hope. Plus I'd LOVE a woo hoo from a doctor, as I tend to just get bad news lately)

He didn't say that. And he is not the woo hoo'ing type (hehe, definitely not)

To summarize, he says with confidence that my first 2 miscarriages were not caused by progesterone issues. My 3rd one - the chemical pregnancy - likely WAS a progesterone problem. And he says he is also positive that yeah, I have a progesterone issue for sure - and we're gonna work on that. But he believes its just affecting my cycles and for the actual losses I may have a bigger underlying issue. Sigh.  

I'll be taking some meds this cycle to lengthen my luteal phase/pump up my progesterone. Then I'll be having a multitude of blood tests done early in my next cycle. They'll be looking for a less diagnosed clotting issue, Insulin resistance, a male hormone that everyone has but high levels can be bad, an amino acid that everyone has but high levels can be bad, etc. Then I'll have a saline ultrasound (SHG) done a few days later in that cycle. He's concerned that I either have something going on in my uterus (so, the ultrasound) or some undiscovered deeper issue (so the bloodwork). He also thinks I COULD have recurring polyps (I've had them removed before) but that even if I have polyps that does not usually cause miscarriages.

He actually...seemed a bit bothered that all my previous bloodwork was so good. Darnit. Especially because when we had our 2nd baby tested, the result was a normal male.  He said normal MALE is even more concerning than female, because with males they can often pick up more genetic issues if they are there. So they're pretty sure its not a genetic issue and its likely hormonal/an issue with my body. Weeee.  ONE of the previous tests will be redone, as my result was on the ""high end of normal"" and he wants to check it again. But otherwise he's now looking deeper.

Since we had our genomes sequenced with 23andme, he said he'd ""love to look at those results"". He said that if we have both our raw data, that he'd be able to spot something that might be an issue (even though he doubts that). So we're supposed to forward the raw genome results to him. He seemed to nerd out a bit about being able to see our sequencing. hah 

He said if the bloodwork and SHG all come back normal, he might suggest a biopsy -- as its been shown that sometimes a chronic inflammation in the uterine lining can lead to recurrent loss. That is not incredibly common - and the procedure sucks - but if everything else is normal it would be his next suggestion.  

We both liked the doctor. He was incredibly awkward - like, couldn't/wouldn't make eye contact and when he did it once on accident he almost jumped. And he was very to the point, sometimes a bit abruptly. But not dismissively, just that he knew answers and would tell me if my concerns were valid or not. We found him to be thorough, straight forward, and intelligent...all the things I CARE about in a specialist! Plus, he did seem to care that for me this isn't about increasing the known info in the field, but about having a baby.

We have been trying to conceive our first for about 2 years and so far have had two missed miscarriages and one chemical pregnancy. Things have certainly become more difficult and sad with each one. I am recovering from my most recent MC now and anticipating a recurrent pregnancy loss panel with my RE once it is complete.

The first missed MC was last spring at 10 weeks. It did not start on its own and I had a complicated/traumatic/unusual D&C that did not work out and I had 2 months of increasing pain and bleeding until it was complete. We struggled to get pregnant again and started to see an RE this winter. Just before we started with the RE I am reasonably sure I had a chemical pregnancy (couldn't bring myself to take a test at the time).

After just one month working with the RE I got pregnant again. I was told it was failed at 5 weeks due to low-rising HCG levels. It turned out that it would fail, but had not yet. For three more weeks we saw normal growth and a heart beat, until last week when there was no more heart beat. I had agonized over what to do, but was relieved when the MC started on its own over the weekend. It was difficult, but I preferred being at home and having it happen without intervention. 

Adding insult to injury, this past weekend was when I should have finished my doctoral program, but I spiraled into depression and stalled out over the last year. I am seeing a therapist, but have found it really hard to move on as I watch others do so with new babies, degrees, and jobs. I'm worried that this all is making me a worse person. I don't feel like myself, I feel bitter that I have now been pregnant more times than many friends with children, and I worry about how many more miscarriages I may have to endure before anything good happens.

We have been trying to conceive our first for about 2 years and so far have had two missed miscarriages and one chemical pregnancy. Things have certainly become more difficult and sad with each one. I am recovering from my most recent MC now and anticipating a recurrent pregnancy loss panel with my RE once it is complete.</p>

<p>The first missed MC was last spring at 10 weeks. It did not start on its own and I had a complicated/traumatic/unusual D&amp;C that did not work out and I had 2 months of increasing pain and bleeding until it was complete. We struggled to get pregnant again and started to see an RE this winter. Just before we started with the RE I am reasonably sure I had a chemical pregnancy (couldn&#39;t bring myself to take a test at the time).</p>

<p>After just one month working with the RE I got pregnant again. I was told it was failed at 5 weeks due to low-rising HCG levels. It turned out that it would fail, but had not yet. For three more weeks we saw normal growth and a heart beat, until last week when there was no more heart beat. I had agonized over what to do, but was relieved when the MC started on its own over the weekend. It was difficult, but I preferred being at home and having it happen without intervention. </p>

<p>Adding insult to injury, this past weekend was when I should have finished my doctoral program, but I spiraled into depression and stalled out over the last year. I am seeing a therapist, but have found it really hard to move on as I watch others do so with new babies, degrees, and jobs. I&#39;m worried that this all is making me a worse person. I don&#39;t feel like myself, I feel bitter that I have now been pregnant more times than many friends with children, and I worry about how many more miscarriages I may have to endure before anything good happens. I&#39;m hoping that maybe being a part of a group like this will help me find my way through this process with people who know what it&#39;s like. </p>

The only thing that has come back on any testing as abnormal is slightly elevated TSH (3.451) and then to follow up, TPO antibodies at 183.  My RE just put me on Levothyroxine (50mcg/day) and said no more about it.  I posted about this on the babycenter community for thyroid issues, and the ladies there scared me big time.

They have told me that the testing I've had done isn't enough and that I need to know my free T3 and free T4 levels, which my RE refuses to test.  They suggested I see a thyroid specialist and even did some research to find ones that come recommended in my area.  I tried them both and one is booked solid through January 2017 and the other has a weird medical probation history.  I called the latter anyway to try to make an appointment, but haven't heard back yet (there was no live receptionist, just a strange voicemail box).

I have been on Levothyroxine for just over four weeks now.  I am supposed to return to have my TSH rechecked in two weeks and to see if I need my meds readjusted.  In the meantime, I've also given up gluten, coffee, and all alcohol and I'm continuing to avoid processed foods as much as possible.  The babycenter ladies pointed out that I have Hashimoto's based on my test results and I have researched and readjusted my lifestyle accordingly.  No help from my RE on that front, she didn't breathe the word Hashimoto's let alone advise me on it.

I have had a good solid 27 day cycle this month, which is a great improvement over the 25-26 days I had been having before starting Levothyroxine since all my losses.  I'm optimistic about that!  Also, I'm not overweight but do have a few extra pounds hanging around that I've been trying to lose for the past year.  The scale went down for the first time without my having to resort to fasting to see results.  I'm pretty happy about this and see it as a sign that my new meds and other changes are working.

Do any of you simply take Synthroid or the equivalent for hypothyroidism and that's the end of it?  I would love to take my RE's advice and not worry about finding thyroid specialists if I can at all avoid it.  I'm unnerved by what they have told me on the other forum, and am doubting whether I'm getting the best care possible for my Hashimoto's, but maybe the RE can help me even if it's not the best course I could possibly be taking.

I'm at a loss other than the hypothyroidism as to what to do to stop losing every pregnancy.  If it's not this, we have to move on to even more testing, and I'm not sure what's really left for us to discover at this point.  My last loss was tested and it was a normal xx.

Anyways, any advice appreciated from you wonderful women.

I called the latter anyway to try to make an appointment, but haven&#39;t heard back yet (there was no live receptionist, just a strange voicemail box).</p>

<p>I have been on Levothyroxine for just over four weeks now.  I am supposed to return to have my TSH rechecked in two weeks and to see if I need my meds readjusted.  In the meantime, I&#39;ve also given up gluten, coffee, and all alcohol and I&#39;m continuing to avoid processed foods as much as possible.  The babycenter ladies pointed out that I have Hashimoto&#39;s based on my test results and I have researched and readjusted my lifestyle accordingly.  No help from my RE on that front, she didn&#39;t breathe the word Hashimoto&#39;s let alone advise me on it.</p>

<p>I have had a good solid 27 day cycle this month, which is a great improvement over the 25-26 days I had been having before starting Levothyroxine since all my losses.  I&#39;m optimistic about that!  Also, I&#39;m not overweight but do have a few extra pounds hanging around that I&#39;ve been trying to lose for the past year.  The scale went down for the first time without my having to resort to fasting to see results.  I&#39;m pretty happy about this and see it as a sign that my new meds and other changes are working.</p>

<p>Do any of you simply take Synthroid or the equivalent for hypothyroidism and that&#39;s the end of it?  I would love to take my RE&#39;s advice and not worry about finding thyroid specialists if I can at all avoid it.  I&#39;m unnerved by what they have told me on the other forum, and am doubting whether I&#39;m getting the best care possible for my Hashimoto&#39;s, but maybe the RE can help me even if it&#39;s not the best course I could possibly be taking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m at a loss other than the hypothyroidism as to what to do to stop losing every pregnancy.  If it&#39;s not this, we have to move on to even more testing, and I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s really left for us to discover at this point.  My last loss was tested and it was a normal xx.</p>

<p>Anyways, any advice appreciated from you wonderful women.  I hope you all had a wonderful weekend!</p>
