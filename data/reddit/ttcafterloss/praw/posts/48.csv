Hi all. I just lost my son at 20 weeks on Friday. There was no heartbeat at my appointment, and I'd had a lot of concerns, given how drastically different this pregnancy was from my first (successful) pregnancy with my now 15-month-old daughter. No nausea in first trimester (was horribly ill the first time), no movement, low appetite, no fatigue. I just didn't *feel* pregnant, but tried to tell myself I was over worrying. 

I was induced and delivered him, which was a particularly hard blow to go through that process, on top of the pain of the loss itself. But my husband and I did get to hold him. So hard, but I'm now glad that we did. 

I'm finding that the emotional recovery is incredibly moment to moment. And I recognize how incredibly fortunately I am to have a daughter to keep me going. Those of you going through loss without any living ones - my heart goes out to you.

I want so badly to have a small age gap between my kids, and I'm pretty sure we want to try again as soon as is reasonably possible. I asked the doctor and she said she recommends waiting 3 months, but curious what others have experienced. Is there a medical reason to wait?

Also - after my first delivery, I wore a belly binder that the hospital gave me, to help my abdomen heal. I switched to a belly bandit at some point. I have a small belly from this pregnancy, and I'm wondering if anyone who has lost a pregnancy around this time wore a binder? I appreciate any thoughts on that.

I am ""friends"" with an L&D nurse that I met just before college.  A million years ago.  She posts obnoxious things like videos of herself explaining ""7 ways to prevent preterm labor and other birth complications.""  Hmm.

I have one LC who is 4. I was 40 weeks pregnant in April when my second son died during birth. It was actually on his due date. I was 9 cm dilated and in active labor when his heart rate dropped. A stat c-section under GA followed and, when I woke up, I was told he had died. We had no idea why until two pathology reports showed an abscess in his cord which formed due to cord compression. It has been categorized as a cord accident.

I'm currently in my second cycle of trying (12 DPO today). It took me about three months to get my period back, which was frustratingly long. Then my first cycle last month only had an 8 day luteal phase. This cycle I am 12 DPO, so not sure why my luteal phase is so much longer. Not holding out hopes that I am pregnant since my temp dropped a lot today and my temps are actually lower than they were last month. 

Some days I feel hopeful, but the past few days have been low. Right now I'm not sure if I'll ever have another living child. It is so painful.

I lost my first pregnancy four years ago at nine weeks due to it being ectopic. Besides being emotionally traumatic it was very physically traumatic. I nearly died and had a rough recovery. The on call OB who did my surgery was amazing and saved my ruptured tube. I ended up getting pregnant two months after this with my son. 

So now my husband and I want to start trying again come December. I saw my midwife and she's checking my hormone levels since they couldn't find a cause for the ectopic and she wants to make sure my hormones are ok. I've told a few members of my family that we are going to be trying soon and I find some of their responses really insensitive and clueless. I get this cheerful 'oh yay your son needs a sibling' type of response and I'm just thinking I don't even know if a pregnancy will implant in my uterus or if I'll just end up with an ectopic again so this isn't a very cheerful thing for me. It's scary and it's hard going into it with my eyes wide open that things may not go how I hope. 

Getting ready to try has brought up a lot of hurt from the ectopic. Before deciding to try I still felt very sad when I thought about it but was able to pull myself together. Now I've been crying about it whenever I think about that baby. I know this is normal, it's just hard and for some reason I feel silly. 

Now I'm waiting for my blood results to find out if I need to be on progesterone cream or something even stronger, I'm starting to chart my ovulation, and hoping a lot for good results.

Im a new member of the club that no one what’s to be a part of. Sunday October 8th was the worst day of my life. I was visiting friends out of state, at 11 weeks pregnant I thought I was nearly out of the woods. However I was woken up in the middle of the night with the strangest sensation something was wrong. I ran to the bathroom and found light bleeding. My doctor had said spotting and small amounts of bleeding could be normal in early pregnancy. I tried my best to stay calm but in my gut I knew this wasn’t right. I tried calling my husband, but no answer at 2 AM. The cramping started early in the morning around 8. I called my doctor who said not to worry unless the bleeding was heavy and the cramping severe. Being out of state I was sacred and just wanted to be home. After googling like crazy I knew if this was a miscarriage that there was nothing that could be done medically to prevent it so early on in the pregnancy. I got on the next flight home to be with my husband. That was the longest and worst flight of my life. Scared, alone, bleeding and fearing of loosing my baby. By the time my plane landed the bleeding was heavy and cramping severe. I was filling 2 pads an hour. We rushed to the emergency room where they confirmed my worst fears. I was loosing the baby. They sent me home with meds to deal with the pain and methylergonovine for the bleeding. I’ve been home now for 3 days and while I’m improving physically, mentally I’m struggling. You always think “that will never happen to me” yet here we all are. Most of my friends have wonderful happy, healthy children, and I just lost mine. I can’t help but thing “why me?” It makes me feel even worse being so bitter about other people’s happiness when mine was snatched from me. Coping has been incredibly difficult. I’m usually such a strong person who can find logic and understanding in all bad things however this time I feel so empty and lost. My husband has been amazing throughout all of it. He’s truly been my rock and I feel we are stronger for it. But despite all my support around me I still feel so alone. I know in time I will heal, but how do you deal with it now? I was fortunate that the doctor gave me a note to miss work this week, but Monday I will have to face everyone and I don’t know how I will bear it. 

Any tips, advice, words of wisdom on how to deal with this tragic loss and not feel so angry, sad, bitter and alone would be appreciated. I would love to find a way to channel these feelings into something productive but right now doing anything feels hopeless.

All baby loss families, friends and loved ones are invited and encouraged to join the event whether participating in a municipal, community illumination or a lighting from the comfort of home, all are welcome.

Each year the International Wave of Light invites and sees thousands of baby loss families, friends and loved ones from across the world and around the globe participating in honor and everlasting remembrance of the far to many little lives lost to soon and the grieving families that are left behind as the result of; however not limited to: miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal and postnatal death, SIDS.

The Wave of Light commences at 1900 hours on October 15th in each locals respective time zone. Candles and monuments are lit for a period of at least one hour. The result is a continuous chain of light spanning and encompassing the globe in love and light for a 24-hour period in honor and remembrance of our loved and longed for children who pass away during pregnancy and in infancy and recognition of grieving families left behind.

Remember to share pictures of your lightings upon the official #WAVEOFLIGHT2017

Context: I'm 28 and partner is turning 37 this week. We have one living child, no issues conceiving her.
Experiencing my 5th loss in a row right now. We had done RPL testing which included surgery to remove uterine polyp and retained fetal tissue, and I was put on progesterone supplementation at 4DPO after the 4th loss. The first three had been attributed to thyroid levels which have been fixed for awhile. Results from all other testing has been fine; we're still waiting on the karotype and was told it could take months.

RE had recommended Femara at initial appointment regardless of testing results because she likes all her patients to get that ""boost""? I had declined at the time because I'm still nursing my toddler once a day (prolactin levels are fine btw).

So my next step would be Femara, though that of course means full weaning. As would any meds with IVF.

Context: I&#39;m 28 and partner is turning 37 this week. We have one living child, no issues conceiving her.
Experiencing my 5th loss in a row right now. We had done RPL testing which included surgery to remove uterine polyp and retained fetal tissue, and I was put on progesterone supplementation at 4DPO after the 4th loss. The first three had been attributed to thyroid levels which have been fixed for awhile. Results from all other testing has been fine; we&#39;re still waiting on the karotype and was told it could take months.</p>

<p>RE had recommended Femara at initial appointment regardless of testing results because she likes all her patients to get that &quot;boost&quot;? I had declined at the time because I&#39;m still nursing my toddler once a day (prolactin levels are fine btw).</p>

<p>So my next step would be Femara, though that of course means full weaning. As would any meds with IVF.</p>

<p>But at this point, is Femara going to make any difference? Am I going to need a 6th loss under my belt before IVF with PGD becomes our only viable option?</p>

The baby was supposed to be my 3rd and final child. I’m lucky enough to already be a mom of 2 awesome boys. It’s been 6 months and I’m still so angry and upset over what happened. It still feels surreal some days. A year ago I was the happiest I have ever been - I had just lost over 50 lbs and ran my first half marathon. Life was good. We talked about adding “just one more” to our family for a long time and decided in November we would stop protecting and see what happened. I got pregnant that first cycle and found out on Christmas Day. It was all so perfect or so I had thought. Everything went great until my 16wk appt and they couldn’t find s heart beat with the doppler. I was sent for an emergency ultrasound and to our surprise the baby was fine! Whew! The very next day I got a call from my doc saying my blood work came back 1 in 5 for trisomy 18. I had to get another blood test done and for 2 weeks I stressed out waiting for the results. Turns out, the baby DID not have trisomy 18. A few days before my anatomy scan I started spotting. I called my doctor and they told me to take it easy, I probably just overdid it. The day of my anatomy scan I felt really “off”. I couldn’t get excited. Maybe I knew it was the end. When they brought the baby up on the screen I knew something was very wrong. My baby died. In comes the doctor to talk about labor or d&e. 2 days later I had a d & e. 3 weeks later a nurse from the doctor’s office called to tell me my baby’s pathology report came back “normal”. I’ve never cried and screamed so hard in my entire life. I actually woke up one of my son’s from his nap and my other son told me I was scaring him. I never got help and my hospital never gave me info on grief. I wish I had and I know it’s not too late. The summer was hard counting down the weeks I would have been. Seeing all the perfectly round baby bumps at the pool I take my boys to. All these women looked like they were due around the time I should have been due. My very good friend announced her pregnancy and then another good friend announced she’s pregnant the same week as the other friend. Knives in the heart. I’m happy for them but I’m also very envious as well. The one thing that would help make me feel better, I’ve been failing at - getting pregnant again. I’m miserable. I put weight on. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I can’t even go to the beach for a few days with my family without thinking of how I should have a newborn with us. My due date was last month and no one remembered. I’m only happy when I’m drunk or sleeping. I’ve been nasty to my husband. My marriage is on the rocks because of all of this. I’m not the happy, loving wife and mother I was a year ago. This loss has really ruined me. I don’t see light at the end of the tunnel. I start getting hopeful and then my period shows up. I thought for sure I would be pregnant by now...Why am I having problems getting pregnant when it was so easy a year ago? Will I ever be happy again? Will I ever get out of this funk and live again?

84,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"My wife and I have been trying to conceive and achieve a healthy pregnancy leading to a healthy baby. This has been the case since August 2016.  We were ready February 2016, but postponed the process because I switched jobs and wanted FMLA protections and maternity benefits from my new employer. 

After two failed rounds of IUI, we conceived in early November via artificial insemination (fresh sperm) and low dose of Clomid.  We were over the moon. Ordered a crib, assembled it. 
My body miscarried at 7.5 weeks in early December. It was physically painful but the heartache hurt even more.  I did not have a D&C, but passed our baby naturally, albeit in an airport bathroom since I was traveling to a conference for work. 

We TTC at every cycle following with fresh sperm and good timing (ovulation strips, fertility monitor, tracking BBT). Our fresh sperm donor is also a 2.5 hr flight away, so monthly trips to see him were also part of this process. 

I was ready to give up end of May/early June, but decided to go one last round. Back on clomid. Ordered a syringe called ""mosie"". 3 daily inseminations. A week and a half later, I sobbed when we got our positive. 

At our 6w3d appointment, July 3, and my wife's birthday, we found out that twins were in my womb and our world turned upside down with joy.  Double rainbow babies. So we started painting the nursery sky blue with rainbow decor everywhere. We wanted so much to celebrate. 

Babies were right on track for growth the entire pregnancy. We consulted with the doctor about potential risks, nutrition, morning sickness, etc. 

Around 14 weeks I started spotting and OB diagnosed me with a low lying placenta, which resulted in pink and brown spotting. 

Then it became red a few weeks later.  OB blamed it on the previa. Recommended we ""take it easy"" but not to worry since it didn't look like an abruption. Just a small bleed at the edge of baby A's placenta.  Also, they voiced some concern over low amniotic fluid. We had an anatomy appt the next week with the MFM, so decided to proceed with them monitoring all concerns. 

The morning of the appt, I passed a blood clot the size of my palm. I figured I would ask the MFM about it. He confirmed the amniotic fluid was low and concerning. Also, complete placenta previa. But everything else was perfect. Perfect hearts, kidneys, bladder, lips, brain and eye development. Everything was spot-on for development. He couldn't explain the fluid issue and told me to take it easy with the bleeding. I cancelled the next day's business trip. 

I bed rested all week. I drank 4 L of fluid a day to try and hydrate our twins.  We found out they were a big and a girl. 

A week after the MFM appt, I started feeling Braxton hicks contractions. Overnight the bleeding worsened, passing 3+ clots everytime I went to the bathroom, but I was not in any pain.  We waited until morning, when I started to feel back pain, and called the on-call doctor. She told us to go to L & D right away. 

I woke my wife and we drove to the hospital (1hr in rush hour traffic). I had 11 contractions along the way.  

They admitted me to the hospital where I was out in an IV for hydration. They monitored the contractions. And most importantly, they monitored our babies' heartbeats. They were strong. 

Over the next 2 days, blood flow was up and down. Contractions lessened some. They had me on procardia and it seemed to help. Dr wouldn't let me out of bed even to urinate so they would help me with the bedpan. Babies heart would beat on. 
Wednesday overnight, the cramps became strong and painful. The doctor examined me in the morning and delivered devastating news: I was 1cm dilated and the placenta was bulging or pro-lapsing.  She told me I needed a c-section that day. 

Babies still had strong heartbeats and I wept at every state of prep for my 20 w c-section, knowing we would lose them.  I bawled through the epidural. I screamed as my wife hugged me in her matched grief. 

I delivered a perfect little son and daughter at 12:30pm on 10/5/17, and their hearts were still going. Our son, Leith Verdon, passed 10 minutes after delivery as I held him and his sister on my chest. Our daughter, Lyra Estelle, passed 2 hours later in my arms. 

My wife and I are devastatingly heartbroken again. We held our babies, loved them, kissed their foreheads. Took as many pictures as we could in order to preserve their memory.  

And we bawled as we said our final goodbyes to release them to the funeral home last night, 10/6/17.  They are being issued birth certificates and SS cards. And subsequently, we'll need to request the death certificates as well. 

We don't know how to process all of this. No words seem to help right now but I needed to vent.  I can't even start to think about TTC again, but if anyone has been through anything similar, I would appreciate insight into the timeline of your own return to fertility. 

Again, I'm sorry if I am posting this in the wrong thread or if it causes anyone else duress. This is our heart wrenching story. Please help us process it. Thank you so much for letting me vent, and for reading our story. ❤️

<p>I delivered a perfect little son and daughter at 12:30pm on 10/5/17, and their hearts were still going. Our son, Leith Verdon, passed 10 minutes after delivery as I held him and his sister on my chest. Our daughter, Lyra Estelle, passed 2 hours later in my arms. </p>

<p>My wife and I are devastatingly heartbroken again. We held our babies, loved them, kissed their foreheads. Took as many pictures as we could in order to preserve their memory.  </p>

<p>And we bawled as we said our final goodbyes to release them to the funeral home last night, 10/6/17.  They are being issued birth certificates and SS cards. And subsequently, we&#39;ll need to request the death certificates as well. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know how to process all of this. No words seem to help right now but I needed to vent.  I can&#39;t even start to think about TTC again, but if anyone has been through anything similar, I would appreciate insight into the timeline of your own return to fertility. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m sorry if I am posting this in the wrong thread or if it causes anyone else duress. This is our heart wrenching story. Please help us process it. Thank you so much for letting me vent, and for reading our story. ❤️ </p>

I was 6.5 weeks pregnant. They tried to tell me that my dates could be wrong, and it could just be early. After explaining that I not only was certain about my date from temperature from I also found out at 11dpo, so my dates couldn’t be more than a couple days off, the nurse practitioner just said “oh...”. She wants me to wait for this to happen naturally for a week or two. I just want it to be over. I can’t believe how hard this is. There are so many things. And unfortunately so many negative stories that I am telling myself. 

I’m at a loss for what to do next. I know I don’t have to decide now, but I’m so conflicted. The pregnancy was really hard on me. From week 4 to 5, I cried pretty much the entire week. It got better at week 5 and I thought I could get through it. Now I guess maybe that was just when the hormones starting to decrease. I don’t know how long this process will take. I just feel like I am forever waiting. Waiting for the official confirmation from blood tests on Tuesday... waiting for the miscarriage to start... waiting for the bleeding to start... waiting to see if it takes time for my cycles to regulate again.  And I miss my baby. 

With the pregnancy being so hard, I am hesitant to think that I could do it all again. One part of me wants to never have kids now. Another part says I need to wait another year to be more stable in my career. Another part says it needs to be closer to at least a year and a half. I have so many concerns. Then I worry about how to wait or if to wait. If we wait, do I go back on the pill and risk having to wait for my cycles to regulate after getting off again? Do I start charting again and use that to avoid? It’s an awful feeling to think about really trying again. I loved the information it gave me especially now when I know it gave me real information now instead of waiting to be in limbo until the blood work came back. But trying was so stressful. It was such a rollercoaster of emotions and getting up early was not my favorite since it woke me up or gave me anxiety thinking about it all everyday. We tried for seven cycles before getting pregnant and the entire process was stressful. I don’t know what to do. This has been so hard, and the miscarriage hasn’t even started. 

What was your experience like? Did you wait to try or go right back at it? If you waited, how long did you wait?

I am struggling hard with advice to take a few months off while I wait for tests. Initially I'll go on a waiting list. I doubt I'll be seen by a specialist for the first time until mid-November. 

I have had three early losses, 4.5wks, 6.5wks,6 weeks, all in the past six months. So far my periods have returned on time and I've always ovulated in the cycle afterwards (of course things can change). 

I had a problem free conception and live birth 2 years ago. The last 2 conceptions this year happened in cycles when I was doing all the things I could do at home - mucinex (UK equivalent), aspirin, multiple evidence-based lifestyle changes to improve chances, tracking everything etc. I'm 32, and it looks like I need this much effort and a few months of trying to conceive now, it's not a first-try thing. 

I have done a lot of reading and understand that the chances of unexplained recurrent loss are high, like really high - the NHS NICE guidelines state that unexplained rpl accounts for up to 60% of cases. Additionally the prognosis for unexplained RPL is good - most people will eventually carry a baby to term.

10-15% of rpl sufferers suffer antiphospholipid syndrome, and this is the only thing that really worries me (since uterine abnormalities and other problems are either rare and require IVF which isn't an option, or are less implicated in early losses). Though it's not highly likely I have it, the chance of carryinf to term if I *do* have it are slashed in half without treatment. 

I'm trying to decide whether I sit around and wait the 3-4 months for testing (if not longer) and take the risk of wasting my  eggs and maybe a chance at a good one, or whether I continue and risk another loss.

My bff, who is like a sister to me for nearly the past 20 years, was there for me entire pregnancy/loss and then one day in June, at a mutual friend's birthday party/dinner out in public that she organized, sat me down and told me she was pregnant with her second, a boy. 

I lost my shit, bawled, cried and this happened in front of everyone. It was the most miserable/embarrassing birthday dinner because the focus became her pregnancy and my agony/despair, not the birthday girl. I don't think she could have chosen a worse way to tell me when I'd been talking to her daily via text/phone about my pain/grief, etc. Why didn't she just tell me over the phone or give me some privacy? 

Our relationship has been strained since. We were supposed to hang out once but I cancelled- couldn't handle it. We text every once in awhile but nothing like before. Our relationship feels fundamentally different. 

Of course I am happy for her, but it felt like a knife going through my chest when/how she told me. It felt like a betrayal of trust to tell me that (I know that sounds dramatic!) but to me it felt like a level of our friendship was breached.

Her sister sent me an invite to her baby shower yesterday - which is next month. 

I cannot go, guys. Emotionally, I cannot handle it and being around pregnant women still makes me sad.

I hate that my loss has impacted so much: my friendships, my faith, how excited (I'm only sad) about pregnancy announcements I get, my feelings when I see pregnant people. Feel so robbed of so many things. 

Will gently tell her via text prob that I cannot go because of this. Wonder all the time whether our relationship is now changed forever. :( This is someone who has always been like a sister to me/who I always could count on til this moment happened.

I just worked up the nerve to join this sub. To keep this as short as possible, I'll post two comments I left in BabyBumps six months ago:

""Hey Everyone!
I'm ecstatic to be back in the BabyBumps community. I'm 4 weeks pregnant with my second - found out at 3 + 1 but had that ""feeling"" almost immediately.
My first is 22 months and this is definitely a whirlwind for us. I ugly cried about not being ready as my initial reaction, but hey, I was even less prepared for my first.
I was pretty active here before but under a different account. I was diagnosed with MRKH (and therefore the inability to have kids) as a preteen. I posted my story then and got lots of encouragement. Having a kid was never in the cards for me, but now I'm on round two.""

And to explain my medical condition:

""I have a full copy of it saved somewhere on my laptop but basically:
I was diagnosed with MRKH when I was 11. I had severe abdominal pain and kept going to the emergency room. It turns out I'd been menstruating for about five months. With my case of MRKH, I have a fully functional uterus but was born without a vaginal canal. So my periods backed created a huge mass and I had emergency surgery to drain it.
Between 11 and 18 I had several surgeries - four or five I believe - to create an artificial canal. But with all of the surgery, endometriosis, and tons of scar tissue in my reproductive system, I went from being diagnosed infertile to being told I could probably get pregnant but could never actually carry a pregnancy to term.
I got pregnant with my first at 23 and had a fairly healthy pregnancy. I have to have birth via c section; it's impossible to give birth naturally for me. But I can have healthy pregnancies and babies!
I spoke with my old treatment team from years ago, and there's no other documented cases of an MRKH carrying out a pregnancy. Pretty incredible and wild to me!
That was a lot longer than I expected, lol. Sorry! It's hard to sum it up without leaving out important details.
Edited to add: I also started receiving depo birth control shots regularly at age 11 to stop my periods. I think that was another contributing factor for why they thought I'd be infertile. It stunted my puberty growth a bit.""

I had a MC at 10 weeks (measured about eight weeks). The cause was listed as some sort of tear in the sac. I honestly can't remember. I was alone when I found out, so the shock kind of took over.

Due to my medical history, I had no choice but to get a D&C. I also had to get another surgery simultaneously because of my medical history. Long story short, it involved stitches and a skin graft inside of my cervix. My OB gave me instructions to call her ASAP if I get pregnant. But I don't even know if I can. I don't know if those surgeries messed things up. 

I had a long recovery - physically and emotionally. But my fiance and I decided to try again. I'm 14 DPO, cramping, and I know my period is starting within a day or so. Negative tests all around. Edit: period is here.

I know nothing about TTC. I just know we tried during my ""peak fertility"" according to Clear Blue. I'm taking folic acid, eating healthy, prenatals...you ladies know. I'm 26. I don't have a mother. I don't know who to talk to about this. At all.

If you read this, thank you. I needed to get it off of my chest. I know that one month of TTC is nothing. But getting the courage to join here and write this was something I needed to do.

Hello, I apologize in advance for any formatting issues or potential text-walls... I'm on mobile and this is my first post after being a long time lurker. I'm also still ""out of it"" and might (will probably) ramble.

I recently suffered a miscarriage for what would have been baby #2. I was able to take about 5 days off of work, and this is my first week back.

I can't seem to get through a single work day without feeling exhausted, getting short-tempered with my team about things I would not have in the past, or taking my bad mood home to my family that is right there with me trying to heal. I'm the primary income earner for my family in a management role, and lately I've just been wanting to quit my job and focus more on my family; something that isn't very financially feasible even with Husband willing to make a transition (we'd end up taking a significant income loss).

Husband is very supportive even as he is working through his side of this loss, and we have been sure to give our toddler more time and affection- and try to keep the sad bits away from her.

I'm trying to seek counselling services through my employer, and am waiting on responses from my management. (I have heard back and was provided with resources to get into counselling)

I am not okay, I've been having dark thoughts and feelings of hopelessness which I acknowledge and know to be big signs of depression. In my past, I've had tools to help me navigate those emotions but I find myself painfully lacking for this. I find myself disassociating with my surroundings; I end up staring off at nothing in the middle of conversations... Randomly breaking down to cry and without the ability to verbalize my feelings or thoughts even though it feels like my insides are screaming for help.

I don't really have anyone to physically talk to, since very few people knew I was expecting to begin with. Perhaps just typing this all out with help me some.

What can I do? How can I cope with not only this loss but the constant thoughts of what could have been? My mother has suggested a support group, but I don't know where to even start.

I know that every woman's body reacts differently after a MC so I'm not expecting any sort of universal answer.  I'm more curious to see whether anyone else has experienced something similar.  I realize that the sex bit conflates the situation.

Aug 29 I started miscarrying at 8+3 (though I knew it was coming since 6+5).  I bled really heavily for maybe 4-5 days, then it tapered into on-and-off spotting for another two weeks.  About 3 weeks after I started miscarrying, I went in for a followup ultrasound with my OB and he said there was still a little bit of material left inside that should come out with my next period.  We were cleared to have sex, but were told to avoid getting pregnant for 2 months.

So, my first post-MC period started Sept 30, 33 days after I started MC'ing.  I had 3 day of heavy bleeding (normal for me), followed by one day of very light spotting.  Normally the rest of my period will taper out after about 6-8 days during which my body will expel clots and dark brown blood.  My husband and I have also had sex during the spotting days of my period, and at most it may pump some clots out.  But after yesterday's sexy times, I bled bright red blood.  Overnight, more bright red blood came out and when I went to the bathroom in the morning my pad was soaked.  The only time this has happened in the past was when my hymen first broke/tore/whatever.  The bleeding has subsided a bit but bright red blood is still coming out.

Has this happened to anyone else?  I've read that the vaginal wall can become engorged with blood during pregnancy and there could be spotting after sex while pregnant, but I'm not right now.

I don't have my post - op from my ectopic until next week but I like to be prepared and there are only so many Guided Reading plans I can write before I need a distraction. I am making a list of questions to ask the doctor when I go to see her a week from Friday. She already said I can start again as soon as I am ready but I am  going to wait for my cycles to normalize. The questions I have so far are: 

1. Can I get my progesterone tested before I am pregnant again?  My progesterone was a 4.5 at 5 weeks which led them to putting me on progesterone. I've now done some research that says I should be on progesterone before I get pregnant for it to be effective. 

2. My right tube was damaged to due a burst appendix (thanks high pain tolerance!) and appendectomy when I was younger. She said the left tube looked ok but is IVF something that I should look into in order to avoid another ectopic. What if this surgery damaged my left tube? 

3. I have PCOS (cysts are on my right ovary and elevated hormone levels). Is there anything I need to do in order to carry to term (like taking metformin). I was not on metformin with my last pregnancy but would like the next pregnancy to have the best chance possible. 

4. Are my chances of another ectopic really 1 in 10 with the right tube removed? The right tube had all of the scar tissue. The left one looked fine. I know ectopics only happen in 1 -2 % of all pregnancies (I should seriously but a scratch ticket) but I am terrified of it happening again.

My husband and I got lucky and I got pregnant our second month trying only to have it end in miscarriage last June right as school got out.

One of the other teachers I work with got pregnant about 2 weeks after I did and we had both known the other was trying. Since then I have been doing everything I can to be there and support her through her pregnancy even though a part of me hates all of it.

113,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi, first time posting. 

I don't know, here's a ""trigger warning"" I get pretty emotional. Not graphic, but... I just have no one else to talk to right now, and I'm struggling. But I don't want to weigh anyone down with it. 

Here we go.

I'm almost 30, lost our first child to miscarriage earlier this summer.

Been married several years, friend just got married and is due weeks after ours was due. She is being very delicate about it (long-distance friendship, so luckily I don't see the bump). She was very kind to me when I shared news of our loss, and hardly gives me any news on her pregnancy... but now I'm just... I'm just angry.

Angry and scared. But I feel like an asshole. 

So now my friend is due when I was due, a honeymoon baby for her. All my married friends had babies right away, I feel like they look at me sideways for still begin childless. 

And no, I admit we didn't try right away because A) I had just begun hormone therapy to even sustain a pregnancy and B) my husband lost his job shortly after we married and spiraled into depression over the corruption he uncovered in his field. 

I was constantly angry and ashamed.

Fast-forward to this summer, we're overjoyed. New job, new town, new home... new baby... 

Gone. 

She's gone. We'll never meet her.

I felt like a walking tomb. I hate my body, I fucking hate it. Stupid cycle makes me sick, my bleeding is so heavy EVERY month that 2-3 days are basically spent in the bathroom. Ovulation HURTS so much I have trouble walking, using the bathroom, but still have incessant thirst. PMS is so bad I'm almost a different person. Fuck you, body.

My hormone levels were less than HALF what they needed to be. 

None of my in-laws who got the news sent me a card, sent me condolences. They all have 4+ kids. It's like I'm supposed to forget it ever happened. 

I'm constantly angry and ashamed.

I haven't forgotten. I think about it every day. Every period I re-live the loss.

I'm so angry. 

We finally got the ok to try again, Dr has put me on hCG injections, which my husband will administer in my back. We'll do one month's round without TTC and then try the following month if my response is good.

But why NOW when I'm still mourning our first, I'm fighting with cold feet?? NOW I'm thinking of all the negative things people say about having kids, NOW I'm thinking about the other parts of my life...

I should be grateful that we're making progress with my health, that we're moving in the right direction... but I'm scared of losing another baby, I'm scared the injections will make me sick, my health will rob me of more productive time... 

Now I'm scared and angry. What the hell is wrong with me? I should be grateful, things are going so well.

Just a few weeks ago, I got the opportunity to go back to school and focus on my art full-time, BUT I'm scared pregnancy will make me too sick to work, baby will make it impossible to keep focused... I spent (wasted) so much time and energy taking care of us when we hit rock bottom, that now I'm playing catch-up with my art skills... I feel like I'm under so much PRESSURE to get my skills to a professional level in only 9-12 months (if we're lucky) then... stop? What? Having a baby is a good thing! WHY are these things running through my head? What is my problem?? 

We just moved nearer to family, BUT we have yet to settle in and make friends. I'm scared I'll become isolated. One person told me, ""It's really hard to make friends once you have kids."" Great. 

I would rather have our first alive and growing than have all that time. Even if it meant being sick and alone...

Sorry, I'm just... having a bad day, needed to vent. I know there's so much I should be grateful for, so I feel guilty that I'm even upset.  

I can't make head or tails of my emotions. If anyone reading this prays, please send one up for me.

Thanks. Let me know if I violated any rules here, I'm feeling uncharacteristically impulsive, so I very well might have missed something.

118,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Trigger warning: Living child

Today I took my toddler, who turns three this month, on a field trip to a farm/pumpkin patch with her preschool class. It was an exhausting day with a lot of cajoling her to follow instructions/get out of the way of the tractor. At one point, she wanted to play in this little fenced in area full of toys that were clearly intended for children younger than she was, but she's quite small so I knew she wouldn't be overpowering to any of the one year olds in there, and I was relieved to have a few minutes to sit in the shade and catch up on a few texts while she played somewhere safe and contained. 

There was an older woman in this area-- I have no idea if she was an employee assigned to maintain this area, because she seemed overly interested in taking charge of the children, but she wasn't wearing an employee tshirt, and her daughter was there (with what I assumed was HER daughter; she seemed to be about two years old) and the daughter was holding the baby of someone who I presumed was a friend, because she said something that made it apparent to me that the little baby wasn't her own. The older woman made some comment like, ""I've been telling you to have another one!"" I rolled my eyes at this because I always find it annoying when people tell other people to have children, but whatever, if this is normal in their family that's none of my business. 

Then the older woman engaged me in some chit-chat-- she asked me my daughter's name. She asked me if she was my only child. This is a triggery question for me, because I truly never know how to answer it. I have one child and I have another child, but I don't really feel like I have two children. So I tend to answer this question based on my feelings that day/the situation, but generally when it comes up, I say, ""yes, she's an only child"" because I don't really want to get into it with strangers who are generally just trying to make idle chit chat. So that's what I said today, because I didn't want to get into it-- I just wanted to chill in the shade. 

Then she asked me my child's age. I told her, ""she turns three later this month."" Her response?  A joking, ""Oh, well, then it's time to have another one!"" Fuck you very much, lady. That's none of your business. But again, I didn't want to talk to this woman any more than I had to so I just stared at her stony faced for a second and then went back to my phone.

A few minutes later it was time to collect my daughter, so I geared myself up to have a negotiation about how many more times she could go down the slide before we left. As I was trying to engage my daughter, the old lady came up to me AGAIN. ""My daughter doesn't think she wants another one just yet. But are you thinking about it?""

WHAT THE HELL, LADY. How dare you? This is none of your goddamn business. I was crouching on the ground to try to talk to my daughter but I looked up at her and was like, ""You know, I did have a baby. In May.""  And she got SO excited, like, ""Oh, you did?""  And I said, ""Yes. He was stillborn."" 

AND THEN.

She looked at me, tried to bend down and HUG ME, and then the most preposterous thing of all-- she said, ""It's okay.""

I took a step back. ""No. It's not okay. My baby is dead. It's not okay."" 

She was still trying to hug me. (Seriously, what the hell.) ""You'll see him again someday."" (WHAT? ARE YOU GOD? NO? THEN DON'T TRY TO MAKE SOME BULLSHIT GUARANTEES LIKE THAT TO ME.)

I rebuffed her again. ""I don't want you to hug me. It's not okay. Don't tell people that they should be having children, it's none of your business."" And then I scooped up my daughter, who, bless her, knew better than to have a meltdown about being pulled from her play in that moment, and stormed off. 

I hope I ruined that woman's day. I hope she is still thinking about this encounter as much as I am. I hope she feels terrible for butting into my business and forcing me to delve into a painful topic on yet another day when I am trying to survive the world after burying my child and help my other child navigate that loss as well.

<p>Today I took my toddler, who turns three this month, on a field trip to a farm/pumpkin patch with her preschool class. It was an exhausting day with a lot of cajoling her to follow instructions/get out of the way of the tractor. At one point, she wanted to play in this little fenced in area full of toys that were clearly intended for children younger than she was, but she&#39;s quite small so I knew she wouldn&#39;t be overpowering to any of the one year olds in there, and I was relieved to have a few minutes to sit in the shade and catch up on a few texts while she played somewhere safe and contained. </p>

<p>There was an older woman in this area-- I have no idea if she was an employee assigned to maintain this area, because she seemed overly interested in taking charge of the children, but she wasn&#39;t wearing an employee tshirt, and her daughter was there (with what I assumed was HER daughter; she seemed to be about two years old) and the daughter was holding the baby of someone who I presumed was a friend, because she said something that made it apparent to me that the little baby wasn&#39;t her own. The older woman made some comment like, &quot;I&#39;ve been telling you to have another one!&quot; I rolled my eyes at this because I always find it annoying when people tell other people to have children, but whatever, if this is normal in their family that&#39;s none of my business. </p>

<p>Then the older woman engaged me in some chit-chat-- she asked me my daughter&#39;s name. She asked me if she was my only child. This is a triggery question for me, because I truly never know how to answer it. I have one child and I have another child, but I don&#39;t really feel like I have two children. So I tend to answer this question based on my feelings that day/the situation, but generally when it comes up, I say, &quot;yes, she&#39;s an only child&quot; because I don&#39;t really want to get into it with strangers who are generally just trying to make idle chit chat. So that&#39;s what I said today, because I didn&#39;t want to get into it-- I just wanted to chill in the shade. </p>

<p>Then she asked me my child&#39;s age. I told her, &quot;she turns three later this month.&quot; Her response?  A joking, &quot;Oh, well, then it&#39;s time to have another one!&quot; Fuck you very much, lady. That&#39;s none of your business. But again, I didn&#39;t want to talk to this woman any more than I had to so I just stared at her stony faced for a second and then went back to my phone.</p>

<p>A few minutes later it was time to collect my daughter, so I geared myself up to have a negotiation about how many more times she could go down the slide before we left. As I was trying to engage my daughter, the old lady came up to me AGAIN. &quot;My daughter doesn&#39;t think she wants another one just yet. But are you thinking about it?&quot;</p>

<p>WHAT THE HELL, LADY. How dare you? This is none of your goddamn business. I was crouching on the ground to try to talk to my daughter but I looked up at her and was like, &quot;You know, I did have a baby. In May.&quot;  And she got SO excited, like, &quot;Oh, you did?&quot;  And I said, &quot;Yes. He was stillborn.&quot; </p>

<p>AND THEN.</p>

<p>She looked at me, tried to bend down and HUG ME, and then the most preposterous thing of all-- she said, &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot;</p>

<p>I took a step back. &quot;No. It&#39;s not okay. My baby is dead. It&#39;s not okay.&quot; </p>

<p>She was still trying to hug me. (Seriously, what the hell.) &quot;You&#39;ll see him again someday.&quot; (WHAT? ARE YOU GOD? NO? THEN DON&#39;T TRY TO MAKE SOME BULLSHIT GUARANTEES LIKE THAT TO ME.)</p>

<p>I rebuffed her again. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to hug me. It&#39;s not okay. Don&#39;t tell people that they should be having children, it&#39;s none of your business.&quot; And then I scooped up my daughter, who, bless her, knew better than to have a meltdown about being pulled from her play in that moment, and stormed off. </p>

<p>I hope I ruined that woman&#39;s day. I hope she is still thinking about this encounter as much as I am. I hope she feels terrible for butting into my business and forcing me to delve into a painful topic on yet another day when I am trying to survive the world after burying my child and help my other child navigate that loss as well. I hope she can&#39;t sleep tonight because she is replaying this situation over and over in her mind. And most of all, I hope she never ever suggests to another person that they should have a baby on HER timetable instead of their own. </p>

My first indication of both pregnancies was morning sickness in the form of diarrhea/loose poops first thing in the morning. My OB said that it’s uncommon, but not unheard of. I’ve been diagnosed as IBS-D in the past, but it’s been largely under control for the past few years. 

I lost the pregnancies, but not the stomach problems - if anything, they are much much worse now than when I was pregnant. I’m starting to get desperate for relief. I’m with Kaiser, I saw my doctor, who gave me an antispasmodic. It helped a little, but not that much (slightly fewer cramps just meant less of a warning that I needed to find a bathroom). I told them I’d been treated for SIBO in the past, so they threw some antibiotics at me. I got so sick from them that I couldn’t keep water down, so was unable to finish the course (they weren’t the same antibiotics I was on previously for SIBO). I’m living off Imodium and peppermint oil to get through the work day. I’m trying to take the right kind of fiber, as well as good probiotics, but nothing is working. I’ve been referred to GI, but Kaiser is Kaiser so I’m at their mercy. I should at least hear from them this week, but I don’t know when I’ll get an actual appointment. I can barely eat without nausea or my food running right through me.

I got very sick afterwards as you’ll see in my post / comment history, and I found out that I have bowel cancer.

A few of me asked to update you, so here goes.

The cancer in my liver didn’t respond to chemotherapy. It grew rapidly and I went from oligo-metastatic to palliative from May until now.

I’m starting a palliative chemo regime next Wednesday but it has a 10% chance of being effective and my oncologist thinks I have only a few months. This chemo will probably take my fertility for good, and even though I know I’ll never be healthy enough to have a baby, it still sucks.

My brother and his wife lost a baby to a chromosomal abnormality and were a great source of comfort to me when I lost my babies. They now have a one year old, Amelia, and one on the way. They live in Canada and I live in the UK.

He started a justgiving page to ask for help getting to the UK which is why my previous post got taken down but I was humbled by the response on social media. They reached goal in under 24 hours.

I can’t wait to cuddle my niece again and spend some time with family. 

Sorry this was not a happier update. My only regret in life is not getting to have a living child, but I’m so thankful that I got to experience a mother’s love through my losses.

131,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi, everyone. I've been lurking for a while and figured it was time to introduce myself.

My husband and I are in our second marriages. I have a son from my previous marriage and my husband and his ex-wife adopted a daughter after a couple of losses. Our family is pretty cool, but we would like a child together.

We spent a lot of time on the fence about having a baby, and finally decided to ""let the universe decide"" and I went off the pill in Dec. 2015. Got pregnant almost immediately in March 2016. Saw the heartbeat at 7 weeks. Started spotting at 11 weeks, went for an US and no heartbeat (and no growth). Had a D&C and we decided to try again.

Took 3 months to get my cycle after my D&C. Got pregnant in January 2017. Went for the first US at 8 weeks and no heartbeat. Gave it another week and nothing. Another D&C. Did genetic testing and found two trisomies that made it not viable.

We are both over 40, so we decided to pursue IVF. All out of pocket, unfortunately. Testing found nothing wrong. 

We went through a round of stimulation and after 12 days only had 3 follicles and my estrogen wasn't super high. We had prepaid for two cycles, and we were able to cancel that round before the retrieval and it did not count toward our 2 cycles.

Second round seemed far more productive. My estrogen rose much more quickly and my follicles were measurable more quickly, too. (The protocol was different.) Unfortunately, I still only have three measurable follicles. But we pulled the trigger last night and are going in for egg retrieval tomorrow morning. I'm hopeful but also trying to be realistic.

I mean I feel like I shouldn't complain. I've only had 1 miscarriage. I have a (soon to be) 2 year old son, and we are only on month 2 of officially trying (3 if you count our kind of bullshit ""lets see what happens. It's like half way through the month but whatever!"" month). But waking up this morning after feeling like garbage all day yesterday (when I was pregnant with my son I *knew* before we tested that I was pregnant. My sense of smell was off, my emotions were all out of wack. I was a different person and it was fucking weird). Woke up and went to the bathroom and right away bright red, Aunt Flo in all her bitchy glory is here in full force. 

I keep trying to remind myself that most couples on average take a while to get pregnant. It's normal to spend multiple months trying and not having any positive results. But I can't help but compare back to getting pregnant with my son (1 month was a hail mary and was a negative. The next month it was literally wham, bam, thank you ma'am) and the pregnancy we lost in the spring was an accidental failed pull out and it happened to be the right timing and we were pregnant. This whole trying, and actively tracking this is so fucking foreign to me it's downright cruel feeling. 

OPK's are ordered on Amazon and slated to be here on the 3rd, I've got 20 of them and here's hoping I actually am ovulated at some point during my cycle because I have no fucking clue what's going on these days in my lady bits. Going out to buy pre-seed (or some other clone that I saw on the shelf the other day that I can't remember off hand) and then I'm going to be peeing on all of the things.

Was going to be doing temping, but my work schedule makes temping a little difficult as I don't always have a consistent wake up time. I live in Canada and we are coming into cold and flu season so my temperature could potentially be all kinds of wacky simply because of getting sick here and there (and with a slime monster in daycare 40 hours a week, we get sick pretty easily these days). 

Supposed to go to a Stag and Doe tonight and it will be the first time meeting one of our newest baby cousins (he's like 5 months now, but he was born right after we miscarried so his existence is a painful reminder of everything.) I also am pretty sure a number of friends/family there will be asking if we are going to be having #2 any time soon as we are really the only ones in the family who are married, own a house, and only have 1 (or none) children so we are kind of the ""next in line"" to have more babies. 

Oh and I'm already sick with a nasty cold and don't really drink at all anymore as it messes with my PPD/PPA related issues.

On June 29, at 27 weeks, I had a bout of what I thought was food poisoning - and my midwives concurred. That evening, I landed in the hospital in septic shock, and the doctors couldn't find my baby's heartbeat. My baby had passed, and I almost died, too. I was so drugged up those days are thankfully a blur. I was put on Pitocin until our little girl, Rose, was born in the ICU late on June 30. 

I had two D&Cs as the doctors tried to figure out how I had gotten so sick. They assumed it was a uterine infection that had spread to the rest of me, but after multiple scans, tests, and consultations (25+ doctors examined me to varying degrees), they determined I had an obstruction in my small intestine that had perforated. I had two more surgeries, then finally went home after 28 nights in the hospital. 

I've been home, slowly recovering, ever since. I was so focused on keeping myself alive that the grief over losing Rose was delayed, but it's hit with full force, especially as I approached her September 25 due date. A couple weeks ago, my husband and I spent a weekend at [Faith's Lodge](https://faithslodge.org/) in northern Wisconsin, where we met other couples going through similar circumstances, and it helped a lot. We found peace there, and it put us in a much better headspace. 

Since I had most of my small intestine removed, nutrition is a big problem, and I'm gradually learning how to eat to nourish my body. My doctors urge patience, and say that once I've healed enough from the surgery and am getting adequate nutrition to support myself, let alone another person, only then can we talk about trying again. Depending on the doctor, they predict that it could take anywhere from 6-18 months. But they also urge me to remember that I'm 36.

So here I am. My period finally (finally!) returned yesterday, almost 12 weeks after the last D&C, which is a really good sign that enough nutrition is getting through and that I'm healing.

**Possible TW:** This post may read like I'm being judgmental about how people approach up-coming would-be due dates, but I'm truly am not.  It started with confusion but acknowledgement that everyone handles loss differently, but I'm now starting to understand how many of you ladies (and some gents) may have felt.

Since joining this and similar communities, I've seen many posts about how their due date is coming up soon or will be in X days, along with words explaining their feelings and/or desires to do something to commemorate the day to recognize the loss.  In no way do I think negatively of anyone who wishes to do that, but it's not something I felt I would have needed to do so it was a desire I couldn't really relate to.  My loss *was* a blow and I was pretty down for a about a week or two, but eventually I accepted the loss and moved on.  Then came a few more losses, some more emotional roller coasters, and I thought I finally reached some sort of dark zen of resignation.  After my most recent loss, my OB and the other staff at his office were very sympathetic, asking how I felt, and I just sort of shrugged and said, ""Well, already had 4, what's a 5th?""

Well, now it's my turn to reach what would have been my due date.  I never calculated what the EDD would have been for the first pregnancy, but but full term would have fallen sometime in September or early October.  If the pregnancy didn't end, I'd very likely be running around (or lying down and recovering) with a wailing newborn, freaking the F out not knowing WTF to do.

I'm neither sad nor relieved, but I don't exactly feel neutral about it if that makes sense.  It's just... sort of a weird thing to realize because I *could* have had a baby and be feeling like I've been thrust into chaos, but instead I'm totally not pregnant, can't try until sometime in mid-November at the earliest (doctor's orders), and will likely be pouring myself a glass of Japanese whisky to sip with dinner before settling down to play some video games.  It's like two completely different realities, and it just feels... *weird*.

I think I'll talk about this with husband tonight and let whatever feelings emerge just take their course.

In other news, I resumed charting the day my MC started.  It looks like I had ovulated on or around CD18.

I edited it since this morning, but I felt compelled to share  partly because I realized from this sub that I wasn't the only one not getting the kind of support from family and friends that I so desperately needed. I think a big part of it is just because no one knows what to say or how to act because so many people can't talk about it because it's so raw and personal. This is what I felt compelled to share with people today because I want people to know. I don't want to pretend it never happened. 

""For most people, today is just another Wednesday. For me, it’s the day I was supposed to become a “real” mom (or at least close). I’ve learned a few things in the past six months. For one, I’m a lot stronger than I’d ever thought. I didn’t know that it could feel like my heart shattered into a million pieces and still keep beating, but here I am. I never knew that just words or photos or seeing strangers leading perfectly normal lives with babies could cause physical pain, quite literally gut wrenching, nausea inducing pain. I’ve learned what it feels like to feel completely alone, despite the fact that “miscarriage is so normal.” (Screw those people, by the way. That doesn’t help anyone.) And even though I know I'm strong, I also feel completely broken, torn apart at the seams, barely hanging on, and as low as I've ever felt. 

I’m writing this now because there are some things I just wish people knew, and they don’t because no one really talks about miscarriage, and talking about it has to start with someone, so why not me?

I wish people knew that it’s not just losing a baby, you lose hopes and dreams that you had begun thinking about. You lose an entire future that you’d begun planning. I started almost obsessively searching online forums for people going through the same thing, feeling the same shitty feelings, just to feel normal and sane. I went to complete strangers on the internet because most people find it uncomfortable to talk about. I get it. It's not easy. It really sucks. It seemed like people expected me to move on in the same way that you move on when a grandparent who’s lived a full life passes away. I want people to know there’s a big difference. I want people to know this experience is life changing. Honestly, six months later, I’m not ok. I don’t know when I’ll be “ok”, and that’s fine for now. I’m not as happy as I used to be. I hate it, but that’s just how it is. I'm still struggling to come to terms with who I am as a person now. I wish people knew that it’s generally ok to talk about it, or to ask how I’m doing (spoiler! Not well at all). I might cry, I might ramble, but it just means so much to know someone cares enough to ask. I might not always be ok to talk, and I'll tell you if I'm not. I guess it just feels like that support system you have when people know you're pregnant just disappears because you're not anymore, when really you need that support system even more. Miscarriage doesn't just end with a D&C. The emotional roller coaster continues well beyond that day.

I’m choosing to think that my purpose for God today wasn’t to become a mom (obviously), but to start discussion and to encourage people to reach out to their friends and family who have gone through this, or will go through this in the future. I don’t think miscarriage should be such a taboo topic. It really sucks, but maybe it can suck a little less for people in the future if everyone starts to realize just how seriously devastating it can be, and to just be there for each other whether you understand it or not. """,t2_p511h,False,,0,False,Should be my due date...
