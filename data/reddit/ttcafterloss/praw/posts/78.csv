I had my annual today and pushed my OB to do an ultrasound to check for retained tissue since I haven’t gotten my cycle and my HCG isn’t 0 has been crawling downward, 9 weeks later. She said I’m sure you’re fine but did it.

Unfortunately I’m not fine, there is a 2 CM circular mass of tissue present in my uterus. She said a cycle might flush it out but it might also prevent me from getting my cycle in which case I’d need a repeat D&C. 

There’s a small chance it’s a new pregnancy which we basically ruled out with urine and blood test plus my history of years of infertility. The sonographer said it was circular “like a tiny empty sac.”

If it’s grown in 2 weeks, on the other hand, and isn’t clearly a new pregnancy, I need to be referred out to a MFM and oncologist to test for trophoblastic disease caused by partial molar pregnancy. I had a triploidy loss but pathology didn’t note any appearance of it being molar. We think the chromosome issue was paternal due to a DNA issue we identified with my husband so more likely to be molar than if it was maternal in origin. 

I’m going to go back in 2 weeks for a repeat ultrasound if my cycle hasn’t showed up and then probably a saline sonogram. 

I’m really annoyed, scared and angry all at the same time. I just want this to be over, I got pregnant in Feb and it’s now almost July. If anyone wonders why you’re told to wait a cycle or two to try again, it’s for rare circumstances like this, not just for dating purposes. Ugh.

Some background: Both me and my spouse are 35 years old, TTC since 2016. Diagnosed with MFI. Had a chemical pregnancy in 2017 (got pregnant naturally) and nothing else after 4 IUIs in 2018, and a failed IVF+ICSI in January where we had egg quality issues. Our home clinic doesn't have an IVF lab so it involves traveling for us. Therefore, we can't just try again right away because we had to save up both money and leave from work. The plan was to do IVF again in October.  In the meantime we decided to try IUI again. On our 6th IUI cycle (2nd this year), we finally got a positive this month only to have the hcg betas not rise appropriately.


They had mentioned slow rising betas sometimes indicate an ectopic but we thought it was going to be an early miscarriage/chemical pregnancy when the beta dropped to 140 last Friday (from 180 48hrs before). Then, it more than quadrupled to 635 over the weekend so that raised concerns about it being ectopic again.


I went in for an ultrasound today (6w+0d) to see if they could locate the pregnancy. At first the doc thought it was in the uterus after all but then said what she saw may be a pseudo-sac. Couldn't find the pregnancy anywhere else. She had a 2nd doctor come in for another opinion and that doc said there was a pseudo-sac right away and suggested treating it as ectopic/pregnancy of unknown location (with MTX). That doctor left and I got dressed.


1st doctor knows we've been trying for a long time and I think is more sympathetic to us not wanting to be benched for 3 months because of methotrexate. We'd like to try IUI again before IVF especially now where this one resulted in a pregnancy. She said she's 60/40 on whether it's ectopic (40% feeling it's ectopic). She said it's not a good pregnancy either way but I could wait and go back Friday for another ultrasound if I didn't want the MTX today. The hope being that by then we might be able to confirm if it's a uterine pregnancy. If it was, I could avoid MTX and try again once the hcg is negative. I decided to do that but now I don't know if it's the right decision. Reading other stories, it seems like most people take the MTX as soon as there is a chance of ectopic. My hcgs aren't that high and I'm only at 6 weeks so I'm not overly concerned it will rupture soon even if it is ectopic. Also, had no pain on either side during the ultrasound when she was pressing on my ovaries. But I know ruptures aren't always predicable so I'm wondering if I should be more concerned than I am. I'm also just sick of being in limbo and want this to be over. At least MTX would put an end to it, even if we did have to wait the 3 months.

My wife and I just experienced a miscarriage at around 7.5 weeks, after a little over a year of trying for pregnancy. In terms of recovering emotionally after our miscarriage, there were a few things that helped us that I thought I’d share here, and maybe hear about what helped you guys, emotionally, during this time.

**Gratitude** \- It’s hard not to focus on what you’ve lost after a miscarriage, or at least it was for us, but my wife and I found that trying to shift our attention, consistently, to what we already had and being grateful for that made a big difference in moving back to feeling okay. Our marriage, our friends and family, our jobs, our dog… these are things we could feel grateful for and with a little intention toward thinking this way, we found a bit of relief. I also really tried to assume good intentions from people’s responses. We got all kinds of reactions from “That’s just so awful” to “At least you get to have a bunch more sex again” and none of them felt good. We had to try to let the words go and focus on the fact that people cared for us. It felt a lot better that way. 

**Control** \- In every lesson on TTC, but especially this one, we were reminded about what we don’t control. The miscarriage wasn’t our fault, and there’s no point in thinking about what we could’ve done or if it’s going to happen again or if we’re somehow flawed or undeserving. We can’t control the past or future and we can’t really control what happens inside our bodies so, despite feeling utterly shitty sometimes, we had to accept that this can and does and did happen and it’s okay.

**Mindfulness** \- Man, there are and were a lot of strong emotions with this process. What helped me was to let myself feel shitty, but also try to remain self-aware of my feelings so that they didn’t totally take over. For me it was the difference between *being* and *feeling* sad and angry and depressed and all the other things. I tried saying to myself, “Alright man, the shitty feelings are here, let’s let them in for now,” and though it might sound silly to put it that way, a little mindfulness toward my feelings went a long way in keeping me present and calm. 

I wrote more about the journey my wife and I have had and t[he lessons we’ve learned here](http://bestoicbehappy.com/stoicism/pregnancy-quest/), if you’re interested.

As supportive as my husband isn’t, he doesn’t understand the true gut wrench when I see a baby update or a new photo of the growing bump. Today they had their twenty week scan and announced they are having a little girl. I feel so hollow and lonely, I just needed to let off a little steam and admit to how I’m feeling rather than bottling it up. </p>

I have been referred to a fertility clinic but without IVF. I have been referred to the IVF clinic, but where I am in Canada, it takes ages to get an appointment. My referral was made in March and I still have not been called for an appointment. I'll be lucky to get in there by the end of the year. 

Anyway, this new unit ordered a bunch of bloodwork and we found out I have high TSH. It came in at 17.18 and doctor's recommended a TSH under 2.5 when TTC. I have now been prescribed a synthyroid which will help get my TSH under control. We figured that was one of the main contributing factors to our recurrent pregnancy loss, until we received a call from this new unit. Our karotyping results were in and to my surprise, my results were normal. Unfortunately, my husband's were not. He has a chromosomal disorder called Balanced Translocation (BT), which can result in an unequal balance of two specific chromosomes. 

As most of you know, on average, 25% pregnancies ends in miscarriage. With my husband's BT, we have to add 50% to that. So, 75% of our pregnancies will result in miscarriage. That number is a little hard to wrap my head around. While it's not impossible to naturally get pregnant and carry a baby to term, it's going to be a difficult journey that will likely be filled with even more loss. 

We have been referred to a genetic counsellor so we will have a better idea of what the scope of this specific translocation is. I'm grateful that we have found this out now. I turned 30 last month but I have a lower than normal AMH count for someone my age so there are a lot of factors at play here.

<p>Turned out there wasn’t a huge emergency- mom and baby were perfect, but the only doctor on call was in said c-section so they needed extra hands. </p>

<p>I honestly didn’t even think anything of it going in- just doing my job as normal.  The second that baby popped out and screamed I immediately dissolved into tears and had to rush out of the room.  I rounded the corner and had to sit down and have a solid cry. </p>

We’ve never met before, her and I (which is rare, nightshift is a small circle) but i could only bring myself to say “will you just hug me?”</p>

I am extremely tough on myself, always have been. I also have OCD (its fairly mild - stopped all medications last month) so I naturally have been obsessing about getting pregnant since we started. That, coupled with my anxiety has led me into a whirlwind since my CP and realizing I am now 6 months TTC without a pregnancy. My mom was 36 and it took her 5 months. My friends all took 2-3 months. Whats going on? This is my thought process... I know it can be irrational, 6 months is not very long at all, whatsoever (although by OB did say to come in at 6 months if we haven't  conceived yet).

Anyway, I was starting to accept my pain and was finding ways to just let it be when my husband and I had a conversation a few days ago. Since the CP, I have either been irrationally angry or tearful and sad. Apparently he hadn't even noticed until we got into a fight about something really stupid, and I mentioned that I'm hurt because he cant see how upset I've been. 

He then told me that he's concerned about my mental health because he questions whether I was pregnant in the first place. I just felt everything around me shatter. How could my husband question me like that? He explained because I was obsessing so much over getting pregnant and the lines were faint. Getting stronger, but faint. I once again reminded him that my blood test was positive and that my OB confirmed I was pregnant, but that from my betas it was clear that was either not going to last or it was very very early. He apologized, claimed he didnt know that (I know i told him but whatever), and now feels terrible. I spent the rest of the day in a gray haze again, switching between tearful moments and snapping anger. He and I have a wonderful relationship... he is a great, amazing, respectful man. We are super open with our feelings and I will always cherish that. But this really hurt.

I know I am depressed. I have to be dragged out of the house to be social. I have gained 5 pounds. I have zero motivation. I cry daily, multiple times a day. Everything feels so dark, constantly, topped off with suicidal ideations (which I am 100% confident I would never act on). I am a chronic pain sufferer and this week alone I have taken my opiates every single night (which I have successfully managed to stay away from nearly completely for months TTC) since I have been at a 7/10 almost all day every day. I work a high-stress job and have to be 100% always and I'm barely at 50%. I work billable hours and I was short of my goal last month and this month is looking quite the same.

I knew I was pregnant for about 5 days before I lost it. It was a CP. No heartbeat yet, no scans. Just a few positive pee sticks and a barely there blood test. How could I be this upset? How could I fall apart? I know my husband is criticizing me for how I feel, although he hasnt gone that far to actually say it. 

In the mean time, I just have literally no one to talk to about it because everyone I have told either does not understand why I am so upset or has told me it will happen again soon. But to me it is not about happening again. It is about the fact that it did happen, and then it was gone.

&#x200B;

Last July I got pregnant right after taking my IUD out. I miscarried at 6 weeks in August. I had no idea how much I wanted to be a mom until I saw that double pink line. I found out I was pregnant while my husband was out of cell service on a work trip and miscarried before he had made it home. It was a surreal capsule experience I carried all on my own. It impacted me more than I thought possible.

&#x200B;

It's our 3rd month TTC since the MC. Today I'm at CD 25. For the 2nd day in a row I'm feeling woozy, my mouth tastes metallic. I have to pee a lot, and I smell everything. I'm not even religious, but I'm praying this is it.

&#x200B;

My circumstances are eerily similar to last year. My husband took off for a work trip today, he'll be unreachable until he's back home in two weeks. I'm terrified of experiencing the same thing again – taking a test, not being able to tell anyone because he needs to know first, and then losing it again all before he's back. I have lots of visits with friends and family scheduled over the next two weeks and they know we've been trying. They're going to ask. Maybe I just won't test until he's back. I'd be a week late by then.

&#x200B;

Not sure if I'll have the will power. Either I don't test and live with the open question for two weeks, feeling that I'm pregnant and not knowing for sure... or I test. If I see a negative, it's all moot. But if I see a positive, I experience being pregnant for two weeks without being able to share it with anyone.

Our TTC #2 story is long and difficult, starting in 2016.  Our daughter was born at 27w2d in 2016 after a failed procedure to try and combat her fetal anemia, and passed away very shortly after birth.  My husband and I have different blood types (he has a rare one that isn't typically tested for), and I developed some aggressive antibodies which resulted in her being affected.  We have a 50/50 shot of the same anemia problems happening, although in experienced MFM hands the survival rate is about 90%, sometimes higher.  We were exploring IVF and PGD but stalled out with the $$, and found out in January of this year that we were unexpectedly expecting again.  In the midst of all the appointments to try and find a better experienced MFM, we discovered a MMC on 3/13, and did a d&c on 3/15.  It was determined that it was another girl, with trisomy 21.

We decided to officially TTC a few weeks ago with a good MFM on board and a possible clinical trial to explore, so we NTNP last month and this month it is full on TTC.  I'm on CD14 today, with good timing so far, so I'm hopeful but cautious.  I would just like my 4th pregnancy to be my final pregnancy, and finally bring home a living sibling for our 6.5 y/o son!

8 week scan today for a first time pregnancy. The scanning place sent me straight to the ED. I suspected something was wrong because HCG after initially doubling normally had slowed down to 10 days doubling time ~ 6000. The scanning woman had possibly the worst bedside manner I’ve ever come across in a medical professional. At least they didn’t charge me for the $350 scan and sent me straight out the door, I guess. 

After 7 hours in the ED the Ob/Gyn Registrar came down to say they couldn’t do anything this evening because the scanning place had not sent the images and had since closed so they don’t know whether the do nothing/drug/surgery to remove the tube approach is the best option. But said I had to stay overnight in case the situation deteriorated. 

So now I find myself in the renal ward (? no clue why... maybe they’re trying to spare me the newborns/healthy pregnancies). I’m sharing a room with an elderly lady who is in much worse shape than me. I have a cracking headache and alternating panic/tears. I’m on nil by mouth in case of emergency surgery so have also consumed nothing since a banana about 20 hours ago, so I’m nauseous from an empty stomach.

This whole situation is just so not awesome. I asked for something for pain/to help sleep about 4 hours ago but the nurses are still
waiting for the Registrar to call back to write something up. 

Has anyone had to make a choice between surgery/the drug and which did you go with? I hate all the options. I’m already 36 and TTC #1 and so stressed about having to wait 3 months before trying again. But obviously do not want to lose a tube if I don’t have to.

I had a MC in March and I was offered testing to see if there were any chromosomal issues behind it. I waited 12 weeks for results, which told me everything was normal. But when I got my hands on a copy of those results I realised they literally only confirm that the sample was ‘product of conception’ and didn’t refer to any testing at all. I was a bit upset after waiting 12 weeks for that and the receptionist told me I could have an appointment with a nurse to discuss things. 

The nurse agreed that it looked like there hadn’t been any testing carried out, and it was too late now for that. So she offered me just a general blood test to test my hormone levels (testosterone/progesterone), which I had done last week. 

I temp every day and track my cycles (have done for around 18 months now) and I was roughly 10-11dpo at the point when they took my blood, (give or take a few days as I was a bit ill around ovulation which might have masked my exact ovulation day) and the results came back with this note on my progesterone:

“Progesterone <16 nmol/L: Ovulation unlikely to have occurred. If this is not a mid-luteal phase sample, suggest repeating approx 7 days prior to expected menstruation”

My level was 7. 

My temps suggest i did ovulate this cycle so I don’t know what this means, and the doctor apparently thinks it’s fine and I don’t need any further testing or interventions. It wasn’t noted where I was in my cycle when I had these bloods taken as no one asked me, so I feel like he’s dismissing my worry a little bit by just telling me everything is normal when my understanding is that ‘normal’ fluctuates during your cycle quite a bit? 

Is this low level because I missed the peak time for it in my cycle and it was on its way down anyway so it came back as low? AF started 48 hours later. Would it drop to pre ov levels before AF starts?

<p>We are now trying again, doing ovulation induction cycles, so I’m certain about when I ovulated (Sunday the 8th at about 3am!!!) and I’m currently 8 dpo. Afternoon of 5 dpo (early, I know) I got pretty specific pinches which got my hopes up they were implantation pinches! And then 6dpo I had very mild period like cramps, over night I got really bad nausea, heartburn and shortness of breath (shortness of breath was my first sign of my last pregnancy) and I even threw up!! I very very rarely throw up. I’ve also had cold like symptoms for about 2 days. I know I shouldn’t be symptom spotting, but do you think it’s impossible to get those kind of symptoms at 8dpo? </p>

<p>I would take a test, but I’m taking pregnyl which contains HCG so would give a false positive! </p>

<p>Would love any thoughts :)</p>

<p>Thanks guys and hope this is okay, it’s my first post !</p>

I couldn't find it with my Doppler anymore close to 10w and midwife didn't at 11w....so when I went in for my nuchal scan at 12w5d  I was scared and worried, but trying to hold onto hope for an anterior placenta.  I wanted to be wrong.  After all the odds should have been on my side, right?  Unfortunately I was right and I knew as soon as she looked at the screen.  Baby measured after 10w and the doctor said there was no sign of abnormality.  I had no bleeding up to that point.  

Since then I've had steady cramping and heavier bleeding each day and am waiting to pass the baby/placenta.

And yet.  At the time when we usually would have shared with everyone good news, after this ultrasound, I can't bring myself even to tell my children.

On May 30 we (my husband and I) went to my regular appointment at 19+4, hoping to hear baby's heartbeat as it had been a month since my last appointment. I'll never forget the moment they told us the baby had no heartbeat, after two failed attempts on the doppler and then an ultrasound.  I fell apart. There really are no words to describe the pain. Then there's the guilt (did I cause this?), the denial (maybe the machine was broken?), and the fear. 

He had stopped growing at around 18+5 (estimate). I was given the choice between induction and a d&e. Initially I thought I wanted the d&e because I felt like labor would be too traumatic. But they informed me it was a 4 day wait for an operating room for a d&e, and I learned I wouldn't have the option to cremate. So I slept on it and decided to go through labor.

On the 31st my mom, husband and I went to labor and delivery. I had a bad reaction to pretty much every drug I took, including the induction medicine which caused a fever pretty much the whole time. About 20 hours after the first inset my baby boy was born at 19+6, and we named him Leo. The epidural hadn't worked and only numbed up to the bottom of my hips, so I felt all the contractions fully.

We held him for about an hour and I played him a song. It was the saddest thing I've ever done in my life. Fortunately I got a memory box with some foot prints and pictures, as well as his blanket and hat. He was a beautiful baby, but it killed me to see how small he was. I'm really glad I decided on the induction, because now I have memories and things to cherish and help me grieve. I look at his stuff pretty much every day. 

A few days into the post-birth grief haze I began to feel sick and a burning when I pee. I called the hospital's nurse line and left a message, figuring I had a UTI. The next day I woke up with really bad back pain and got an appointment to get some antibiotics. Unfortunately it was a bit too late as that night I spiked a fever and ended up in the emergency room. I spent 4 more nights in the hospital for a very unpleasant kidney infection.

While in the hospital they let me know I tested positive on all three tests for antiphospholipid syndrome. I need to be re tested in three months to confirm a diagnosis of APS, which causes blood clots and miscarriage/stillbirth. The doctor informed me that three positives make me more likely to test positive the second time but they don't want to put me on any blood thinners yet, but I got to wear these massagers on my legs to prevent blood clots while I was there. So now I'm just waiting to find out if I have it or not. Fortunately it can be treated and people can go on to have successful pregnancies. 

Trying to find a place of acceptance is very hard. I miss my son more than I ever thought possible. We got his ashes back yesterday and it feels good to have them home with us. I am trying to support both my own grieving and my husband's as well, as he has had to go back to work which I know is hard on him. I'm trying to adjust to the new reality that I am not having a baby anymore.

We haven't even thought of when we will try for another baby. I need to wait at least three months for my APS testing, and it's hard to imagine being able to be pregnant again while I'm still having flashbacks and nightmares, in a depression/anxiety haze each day. I imagine one day we'll know when the time is right, and when the fear is no longer overpowering.

179,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"So I've had 3 CPs in 3 cycles, 

my first CP in January was 5 days after my first positive, my hcg got high enough for a positive CBD

my second in March was just a weak line on my FRER that wasn't progessing so I requested a beta 3 days after my first positive, it came back as 6, 2 days later I started to bleed. (if you check my post history you'll be able to see it on tfablineporn, same as the others) 

My third at the end of May was my longest pregnancy so far since trying with my partner, I managed to get to about a week and a half after my first positive, again high enough hcg for a positive CBD 1-2 (as well as at first good progression on my FRERs), two days into bleeding I had to go for bloods for what will be my referral to the gynaecologist, my bleeding had stopped so I was concerned as to why it had stopped so early and again requested a beta, which ended up coming back as 1.

Just to add in, I also requested bloods at the start of the previous 2 pregnancies (for peace of mind) which they refused to do, because I quote ""a positive pregnancy test is a positive"". 

So anyway, I had a telephone appointment today with the GP who said about my previous betas showing how its in the non-pregnant range, and how apparently during miscarrying my hcg should still be high, so although I strongly believe I was pregnant they have no evidence I was. They've referred me regardless to the gynaecologist but said in the referral they don't believe I was pregnant?!

My positive tests each and everytime (and I dont just do one or two, i do in the range of 15+ its a slight obsession of mine due to anxiety of it all) and the bleeding and the size of the clots I lose after these tests tell me differently.

I'm just so confused by it all and to be honest furious the way she spoke to me like I'm either lying or crazy. Again, I categorically know I was pregnant everytime. I had symptoms. I had the positive tests. I had the bleed and clots that seem to inevitabley come after for me. 

I've never had a period with clots like the ones I've had with these. Nor has anyone else I've shown them to. I'm worried now the gynaecologist won't take me seriously because of what she said in my referral.

Its just so heartbreaking. Having tried for 13 months and then losing 3 pregnancies in a row the last thing I need is a doctor making out that I'm crazy and wasn't even pregnant. Like shes dismissing whats happened to me?

Am I overreacting?

<p>my first CP in January was 5 days after my first positive, my hcg got high enough for a positive CBD</p>

<p>my second in March was just a weak line on my FRER that wasn&#39;t progessing so I requested a beta 3 days after my first positive, it came back as 6, 2 days later I started to bleed. (if you check my post history you&#39;ll be able to see it on tfablineporn, same as the others) </p>

<p>My third at the end of May was my longest pregnancy so far since trying with my partner, I managed to get to about a week and a half after my first positive, again high enough hcg for a positive CBD 1-2 (as well as at first good progression on my FRERs), two days into bleeding I had to go for bloods for what will be my referral to the gynaecologist, my bleeding had stopped so I was concerned as to why it had stopped so early and again requested a beta, which ended up coming back as 1.</p>

<p>Just to add in, I also requested bloods at the start of the previous 2 pregnancies (for peace of mind) which they refused to do, because I quote &quot;a positive pregnancy test is a positive&quot;. </p>

<p>So anyway, I had a telephone appointment today with the GP who said about my previous betas showing how its in the non-pregnant range, and how apparently during miscarrying my hcg should still be high, so although I strongly believe I was pregnant they have no evidence I was. They&#39;ve referred me regardless to the gynaecologist but said in the referral they don&#39;t believe I was pregnant?!</p>

<p>My positive tests each and everytime (and I dont just do one or two, i do in the range of 15+ its a slight obsession of mine due to anxiety of it all) and the bleeding and the size of the clots I lose after these tests tell me differently.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just so confused by it all and to be honest furious the way she spoke to me like I&#39;m either lying or crazy. Again, I categorically know I was pregnant everytime. I had symptoms. I had the positive tests. I had the bleed and clots that seem to inevitabley come after for me. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never had a period with clots like the ones I&#39;ve had with these. Nor has anyone else I&#39;ve shown them to. I&#39;m worried now the gynaecologist won&#39;t take me seriously because of what she said in my referral.</p>

<p>Its just so heartbreaking. Having tried for 13 months and then losing 3 pregnancies in a row the last thing I need is a doctor making out that I&#39;m crazy and wasn&#39;t even pregnant. Like shes dismissing whats happened to me?</p>

<p>Am I overreacting? Could the cheapies, FRERs and CBDs all have been wrong and its just pure coincidence I had a bleed with massive clots as soon as the tests turned negative?</p>
