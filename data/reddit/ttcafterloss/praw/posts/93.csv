I had a D&C on March 3rd after my first ultrasound showed no heartbeat. I should have been 9 weeks along. It's now May 12th and I have not gotten my period back yet. I bled for about a week I would say, after the surgery. I’ve emailed my doctor about this and she has referred me for blood work to check hormone levels. I haven’t made the appointment yet, though.

I am trying to use OPKs to see when I should be ovulating and to try to figure out if AF will be here anytime soon. I am 40 years old and I don’t have a lot of time left to have another baby so I am anxious for this to resolve.

The problem is that I have no idea how I’m even supposed to use these tests. I have the Clearblue digital one that has been showing a blinking smiley for 5 days now. I also use the testing strips which have been showing ‘high” for the same amount of time. I have read so much about when you’re supposed to test, what times and days, etc. that I am getting more confused. Couple that with the fact that I have no idea how long my cycle even is anymore and I feel like an idiot.

It happened around the same time as my first miscarriage (5w3d). Had some spotting the first day and then passed the uterine lining a couple days later.

I collected the uterine lining from the toilet paper because I didn’t know if my OB was going to want to test it for anything to determine why it ended. I didn’t know if it was smart of me or if I’m the weirdo that shows up with her miscarriage in a plastic bag. Maybe both.

July 2019 we had been trying for 7 cycles, charting for 3, and had 0 pregnancies. I scheduled an appointment for an RE for August 27th, 2019, which would have been the end of our 4th cycle charting. That month I got a positive pregnancy test and was thrilled to cancel our appointment. That pregnancy was very eventful as it started with an ovarian cyst that caused intense pain (that was dismissed with “take some Tylenol” by my ex-OB) and internal bleeding and ended with TFMR due to XYY.

As of yesterday, we’ve now had two miscarriages since that termination. We are finally seeing the RE on Thursday and it feels long overdue. Until now I’ve just thought we were very unlucky.

I was one of the unlucky ones that took 5 months for my birth control to leave my system and my cycles to regulate.

We were one of the unlucky ones to have a pregnancy with XYY, which affects 1 in 2000 pregnancies.

We were one of the unlucky ones to have a miscarriage, which is supposed to happen in approximately 20% of pregnancies.

We are now one of the unlucky ones to have 2 miscarriages, which is supposed to have a 2% chance of happening.

After trying to conceive naturally for about 8-9 years I got pregnant via IUI in December. Last Tuesday I had a regular OB check up and the doctors discovered that my blood pressure was high. They decided to put me on a low dose of medications and ordered some bloodwork and a urine test. I did all the bloodwork and tests Wednesday and woke up early Thursday morning feeling a little funny. I had had issues with heartburn and indigestion the week before and chalked it up to that. But a few hours later the OB called and said something was off in my bloodwork and they wanted me to report to labor and delivery for some additional tests. I asked and they said I wouldn’t need to pack a bag or anything. I was 22 weeks. 

We got to L&D and I was told that my blood platelet count was very low and my liver enzymes were off and they were concerned I was preeclamptic. My BP was also in the 180s/120s. I’d spent the last 22 weeks concerned about miscarriages, GD, and genetic tests but preeclampsia hadn’t even crossed my mind as something to worry about until much later. Up to that point everything was going perfectly. We met with the MFM and had an anatomy scan and were told that my daughter was measuring very small and that her blood flow was likely compromised due to placental issues. Unfortunately we didn’t have the greatest communication from all the doctors and staff at the local hospital so I spent that first night thinking that the new meds were helping my BP and my labs were holding steady so we just needed to see if she could grow a bit while I stayed healthy and I was beginning to anticipate a long hospital stay but still thinking I’d come home eventually with a baby. 

Friday morning I was tested for covid because they thought that could be causing my abnormal labs (I was negative) and finally the MFM doc came in and specifically told me that I was being diagnosed with severe preeclampsia and that while my labs were technically “holding steady” as the nurses kept telling me that meant they were really bad but just not getting worse. And my BP was still barely being held in check by the meds. And finally told me that she thought I needed to be transferred to a larger city hospital 90 minutes away for a potential D&E. I also had complete placenta previa and they were worried about complications if they had to surgically intervene and I’d only be able to legally get the safer D&E option at another hospital. 

So Friday night we transferred to the city hospital and met with the kindest, most empathetic doctor I ever met. He grieved with us and knew that this decision was one we never thought we’d have to make and one that no one should ever have to make. Saturday afternoon we said goodbye to our beautiful daughter at 22+2. The doctors, nurses, and staff were so very kind to us and after the procedure the doctor, nurse, resident, and MFM doc who had been in during my procedure came to see us throughout the day Sunday to see how I was doing. The doctors told us that even by Saturday afternoon her blood flow had decreased further and she likely would have passed in a day or two but that waiting even that long would have been even more dangerous for me. It still didn’t make the decision any easier but it did give us a little peace knowing that this was inevitable and there was nothing we could have done to save her. 

They are still surprised that I developed severe preeclampsia this early in the pregnancy and while my husband and I do want to try again someday we are scared to go through this again.

Is it POSSIBLE to ovulate with hcg still in your system? I miscarried March 25. I had betas on April 9 (hcg 46) and April 20 (hcg 4)... but I’m almost positive I ovulated in April 14.

I know HCG can mimic LH on opks, but then why the negative OPKs and suddenly positives if it was just triggered by HCG?

I’m up too early this morning. I keep trying to get sleep, but my dreams have been chaotic for days and the new puppy still sometimes gets up in the middle of the night. The puppy that my father-in-law of 10 biological children insists isn’t our baby. I cried during the surprise quarantine birthday Zoom for Mike when his dad went on this rant (again), because it was another reminder of my two failed attempts at being a “real” mom. I’m not sure if this is worse than my stepfather’s insistence that miscarriages are so common, but now women just know sooner - thanks, that doesn’t make me feel good either.

Today my plan is to throw myself into house projects, talk to my mom and mother-in-law, and stay the fuck off social media. I am not a mom. I have lost two pregnancies, but I am not a mom. I will not show off the bump for the baby due on June 12 and write a beautiful message about life growing in me while the world deals with a pandemic. I will not post a picture of my growing second trimester belly and discuss my rainbow baby and the hope that Mike and I feel for the “little bean” due on October 8. Because, for all intents and purposes, I am not a mom.

I love the moms in my life - my mom, my mother-in-law, my mom friends. But I’m not part of their club. Twice I thought I would be, I imagined the lack of sleep, the diapers, the work/life balance, and the reward of starting a family with sweet Mike, my partner. We modified our budget to account for daycare when buying our new home — the home that was going to be great for our growing family. The nursery is now Mike’s office.

I had an HSG this Friday to see if my uterus was abnormally shaped. I begged my provider to schedule this for me, I wanted it done before my due date in June but with the pandemic there were hoops I had to jump through. Those included a doctor on part of my “care team” telling me this is not urgent and I may need to wait until July unless an outside facility would schedule the procedure, finding an outside facility to schedule the procedure, then having the referral denied because Kaiser can perform the HSG themselves. When I finally got the well-intentioned Kaiser scheduler on the phone, she gave me advice to “stop trying so hard”. Yep, this woman suggested I should stop trying so hard to get pregnant and then I won’t miscarry again. Thanks, medical imaging scheduler, I’ll take your advice and stop trying to find the root cause of my fertility issues — then I will surely be a mom.

The crazy part is, I feel the most sane I’ve been in months. I’m doing yoga regularly, on a healthy dose of Zoloft along with talk therapy, communicating better with Mike, and balancing school, work, and life (not that I have a social life in quarantine). The HSG showed that I have some fibroids and/or polyps in my uterus. I got the results before talking with a doctor and according to Google these could be a factor in my fertility issues.

It feels like this was a lifetime ago already. Since then I took cytotec to induce the MC. But not everything passed.

48,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Lets see if I can make sense for you all about whats going on in my head. I've talked to my husband about this and how I'm feeling, but he can't understand it as well as I know you all could.

So, since last fall, we've  been trying for kid #3 and we had a positive result the week before Thanksgiving. Yeah! We were excited, baby would be born this coming August (we'd share a birthday month <3) and all was well. The next few weeks, I didn't really have many symptoms, sore chest area was about it, but I didn't think much of it because I barely had any morning sickness with my daughter, so maybe another girl, right? We spent New Years with my in-laws and one night I woke up with some cramping, but it felt like gas cramps and it felt better after I went to the bathroom, but it was still there. Commence minor worrying. I Googled, cramps can be normal in early pregnancy. The next morning, I started spotting. Very little, but along with the cramps, I started getting more worried. My OB is actually a friend of mine and since we found out we were expecting around the holidays, I was waiting until the new year to make my first appointment. So I texted her and told her what was going on and she told me to take it easy, basically bed rest, and let her know if the bleeding gets worse. She had her nurse set up an appointment and ultrasound for as early as they could fit me in. About a week later, they were able to squeeze me in for an ultrasound (a very uncomfortable vaginal ultrasound) and they found baby where baby should not have been.

Diagnosed ectopic in the right Fallopian tube. According to blood test, my hormones were at a 4 week pregnant level when they should have been around 8-9 week levels. Basically, when I tested, baby had already been lost. Removal surgery was the next morning and my doctor was glad I got in when I did because if I had waited over the weekend, it more than likely would have ruptured and then I'd have been in emergency surgery, in a life or death situation. Surgery went well, minimal damage to my system, and as recovery went well. 

\--Side note/question-- When i found out it was ectopic, I felt relieved, not to say I wasn't devestated still, losing something so precious, but there was a sense of peace.  When I went into the ultrasound, I was a nervous wreck, wanting and not wanting to find out what was going on, just all the emotions except for the happy ones. But when it was diagnosed as ectopic, i felt relieved. I guess it was because there was nothing I could have done to help or cause this. I have had a few friends with miscarriages and I know often times, there is a sense of guilt that comes along because of the What Ifs. What if I was too active, or what if i ate something, or what if that...etc. I had no risk factors for an ectopic, no way I could have known this would happen and no way to prevent it. Does that make sense to anybody else? For those who have also had ectopics, did you feel this way too? Ok, back to it then.

So, after I was cleared for sex and to start trying again, I was hesitant. I'm still a little hesitant and confused maybe. Do I still want to have a third? I knew I was ready for a third last summer and fall when I would watch my kids play together and feel something/body missing. But now, I don' know if I feel that way still. But is it because I really don't want a third or is it because I'm scared of another ectopic? I've talked to my husband about it, but I don't think he quite understands. Even though there was nothing I could've done, I still feel like a failure and am feeling less than body positive still. A little over a month ago, I had suspicions I was pregnant again. I had a test, but it took a day or two to decide to take it. I was unsure what I wanted the result to be. I decided to take it, and then see what I feel afterwards. Would I be relieved if it was negative or disappointed? It was negative. My feelings weren't as clear as I hoped they would have been, but there was a sense of disappointment of it being negative. I took that as a good sign. I do believe my hesitancy was based out of fear. 

Well a month later, I'm in the same boat. Except, I've waited even longer. AF is a week past due, but I've had no other symptoms. No sign of sickness, no sore breasts. I've always been irregular when I'm not on BC, so maybe its that? I know stress can affect cycles, and lets be honest, the past month(s) haven't exactly been peaceful and stress-free. 

So, to test or not to test. Wait for a symptom or two or for AF to visit? I'm still scared to be pregnant again. For those who have another child after loss, do you ever stop feeling scared to be pregnant again?

CW: I mention some birth trauma and a living child in this post. 


I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this. I loved this community when I was TTC after my first pregnancy (which was a blighted ovum). I had a healthy pregnancy and a beautiful baby boy im 2018. Now, I’m here, third pregnancy and will TFMR due to uterine infection.
I am 22 weeks, my anatomy scan on Thursday showed many significant problems and I got a confirmed CMV infection for me and the baby (via amnio) this morning. If you know anything about CMV, remember the worst possible outcome and that’s where my baby is at. He is 22 weeks, but his head (and brain) stopped growing at 18 weeks and he is very small. I have hardly any amniotic fluid, getting 20mL for the amnio was extremely difficult as there was only one pocket with enough fluid. 

I will be induced next week sometime. D&E is not an option. I have an appointment at the hospital on Monday. I’m very, very scared about physically delivering this baby. This is largely to do with the circumstances, but also because I had some birth trauma with my son- everything was textbook perfect (he came in 11 hours, minor tearing, standard pushing phase), but I had three epidurals and none of them worked (they numbed the backs of my thighs and everything below my knees. I felt everything, which I ended up breathing through and went ok, pushing my son out was actually the best experience of my life), then required a spinal for manual extraction of the placenta, which at first was attempted several times without pain relief. I got a spinal and everything was ok after that.
In total, I had 4 injections in my spine. 

I never wanted an epidural again, after that horrific experience, but now I’m faced with an induction and don’t know how I can deliver this baby while feeling all the physical pain of induction and labour. What can I expect? I’ve had misoprostol before with my blighted ovum at 8 weeks- it worked quickly and suddenly, I remember the pain. I don’t know yet which method they will use, but going through an induction is the only option.

58,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone!

Last year in May I suffered a missed abort!on around week 6/7 after conceiving naturally with PCOS. ( I have had this diagnosis for 6 years, but I am lean and do not suffer from insulin resistance, nor do I show any outward signs. Just my ovaries show the morphology and I have hyperandrogenemia, elevated levels of testosterone in blood.)

Thing is, there was lots of blood and I figured I was losing the pregnancy, saw my ob/gyn and she told me to come back a few days later to see what was going on. And during the next check up she said it looked like the uterus was empty.

But I kept spotting for more than 20 days...it felt weird and like something was wrong with my body. So I go back and she tells me she now sees stuff on the ultrasound that shouldn't be there. I get referred to a hospital for a d&c procedure. Procedure goes well, they tell me it looks like there were some placenta cells left, wait for histology to confirm but they're quite sure as they've seen this a lot.

They told me about Asherman's  during the talk before the procedure- but that it was so rare and that they were doing ultrasound guided suctioning to minimize that risk. Fast forward 4 weeks - my period arrives. Heavy, bright red bleeding for 7 days.

That was in June. But ever since November/December my periods became shorter and only last a day or two with minimal bleeding. Currently waiting for my period to arrive but it's only been dark brown discharge for three days. My ob/gyn says its due to the PCOS and go to the university clinic. Appointments take forever there and due to Corona, this is currently not possible.

Now I was wondering : Could this be Asherman's? Does anyone have experience? There is literally no literature that says how long it takes for scars to form, only that if the inner layer is scraped away there is nothing left to slough off and bleed, and I did have a few normal periods after my d&c.I'm at a loss here but all the ob/gyn and ob nurses I asked say it's so rare, they've never seen it, even going as far as saying it doesn't exist. One of the older attending said he had not seen a single case in 30 years and dismissed me, saying it has something to do with PCOS. But I have never had any period issues with that, seeing that I am only very lightly affected by it. (I work in a hospital, but of course I don't want these ob/gyns to check me out as they tell me it doesn't exist anyway. They are clearly not the ones who could help me.)

The whole ordeal was horrible to go through, and after a year I am finally feeling a bit better, but my body is giving me a hard time. I just want things to go back to normal, to have a normal period and to go on with my life.

TL;DR : Had a d&c weeks after miscarriage for retained material. Had a super heavy period 4 weeks post-op ; then some normal periods and for the past 4 months my periods became gradually lighter.

We (me 29, DH 33) began NTNP last August, and by September, I was pregnant (and due within days of my 30th birthday). I was super excited and began doing all the pre-baby stuff, starting registries, planning announcements, and generally just getting ready to be a mom. 

Then, at my first ultrasound, the words came: “I can’t find a heartbeat.” Two days before, my grandfather had passed, so to me, that was more pressing and I told myself that this was the potential for a baby that just didn’t work out. But hey, at least I could get pregnant easily, and after my recovery the doctor gave us the ok to start trying again ASAP. 

In January, we decided to try again. The baby could still even be born in 2020, just a bit later than expected. I also wanted to be more proactive, so I began seeing an acupuncturist for fertility every week. 

Now I just started my 5th cycle of actively trying. My Dr. prescribed progesterone for last cycle and this upcoming one. I went into my acupuncturist last Tuesday and told her that I doubted I was pregnant, since we hadn’t had much baby making time. She relied that “well, I don’t know, it only takes one time,” and reiterated that throughout the appointment. 

So when my period came yesterday, I was depressed. I started rethinking going to acupuncture due to the lack of professionalism (there were several times I had to remind her to do things and her assumptions about how much money I had were...off), and called my doctor to see if there was anything else I could try to help get pregnant. 

After explaining things to the nurse, she sounded pretty sure that they were going to have to schedule labs to start finding out what’s wrong. I’m freaking out, worried that at 29, almost 30, that something is horribly wrong and I’ll never get pregnant. I just wanted this to be easy, but apparently that’s not going to happen.

I could really use some encouragement or just reassurance right now.

I hope this is okay to ask...if not please remove!

I’m currently going through my second missed miscarriage in the last six months. I have a confirmatory appointment for it on Monday (though I know it’s a loss as I’m measuring over 2 weeks behind with no heartbeat and I know my dates well enough to know that’s not possible for me). 

I want to make sure I ask questions to get the ball moving on testing vs. having to wait for a third loss to start. I don’t trust my office to suggest things themselves as they never even suggested testing the embryo in my last loss when I was planning a D&C and the aprn I spoke to kind of dismissed me when over the phone, I asked about options.

Do any of you have suggestions of things to ask that were helpful for you? Tests that you found useful to take? I’m not planning to have a D&C as my hospital will make me do it under anesthesia (long story) and want to ask if they’ll analyze tissue if I miscarry at home but save it, but otherwise I don’t have an idea of tests to ask about or know which questions to mention. I have already done genetic testing and I know I have a bicornuate uterus from ultrasounds. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

(TL:DR trying IUI again after my first try resulted in ectopic)

DH and I tried naturally for more than 12 months before moving to IUI. All of my tests came back perfect, DH semanalysis was pretty much perfect with slightly slow swimmers but they didn’t think it would cause any issues. After many cycles of nothin, I did clomid and trigger shot assisted IUI and it worked, I couldn’t believe it. I must have taken 15 tests to be sure. When I got the blood tests my hcg was low but rising. 

By the third test it dropped and they said I was would be having a miscarriage. A few days later it rose again (not enough to be viable- I never breached 60) so they scheduled me for a d&c which was horrible. My nurses and doctor were wonderful it was just very sad and I still have ptsd flash backs to laying on the operating table sobbing. I also wasn’t expecting it to be as painful as it was. 

My blood results the next day we’re still increasing, so we confirmed it was ectopic, but too early to see on an ultrasound. I had to go to the pregnancy ward of our hospital to get my methotrexate shot, which was awful, to be surrounded by pregnant women as I was ending the only pregnancy I ever had. I had horrible sores in my mouth for a few days which hurt like hell. The second dose fell on a Sunday so I had to go to the cancer ward to get the shot.  The blood test finally confirmed I was no longer pregnant.

Of course, you have to wait a few months for the poison to clear after the shots, and I’m finally in the clear. I just picked up the next round of clomid and my trigger shot. Because of covid they aren’t doing baseline ultrasounds this week so hopefully everything looks ok. I start clomid on Saturday, have an ultrasound next Friday, and if everything looks good will have the IUI next Sunday.

I’m so anxious. I had no idea I would handle the ectopic like I did. I still struggle. I cry myself to sleep at least 2 nights a week or so still, 3 months later. That’s down from 7 nights so I guess that’s an improvement. I still get so upset if I allow my brain to drift back to that moment on the operating table or standing in the nurses station rolling my waistband down to get the shot in my butt.

I almost don’t know which is worse, it not working, or it working again and ending in a loss. I’m also nervous because my odds of another ectopic are much higher than a normal pregnancy. 

I this so badly I don’t know why this has to be so hard. Im sure the fact that I’m on my period and Mother’s Day is this weekend isn’t helping things.

73,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone. I left my bumper group and all the other pregnancy groups yesterday and this seems like the place for me. For details of my story, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/December2020BabyBumps/comments/geks4x/sad_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) from my bumper group yesterday (it also links to my previous post where I was worrying about a MC and then was given a large ray of hope for 6 days, only to be crushed yesterday where they saw no heartbeat).

I’m 34 years old and my husband and I have been trying since we got married in September 2019, NTNP before that for about a year. I have one blocked fallopian tube, so we were over the moon to find out on April fools day that we conceived spontaneously! (The plan had been to start clomid and IUI, which obviously was derailed due to COVID.) 

I found out I had a MMC yesterday at a little over 8 weeks, and the doctor thinks the heart stopped beating a few days ago. It was especially heartbreaking, since we saw a heartbeat of about 150 the week before. I was fortunately able to get scheduled for a D&amp;C next Tuesday. My hospital is only doing them one day a week due to COVID and it’s hard to get a spot. While I’m very worried about scarring, I feel the D&amp;C is the right choice for me. I don’t think I can psychologically (or physically, due to emetephobia) handle misoprostol. The doctor said the pregnancy is still completely attached to my uterine wall, so expected management could take weeks.

I think the cruelest part of this right now is I have to keep reminding myself I’m no longer pregnant with a live baby. But I’m still pregnant in the sense that my body doesn’t realize... I am nauseated all day, completely exhausted, and have my weird pregnancy boobs. I hate looking at my body because it feels like it’s mocking me. I also hate looking at it because I hate how it looks. I was so active and ate very healthily before my pregnancy, but all of that went out the window once the nausea, exhaustion, and dizziness started. So now I’m not pregnant, I’m just fat. I wish I could have sex with my husband, but I’m still so nauseated that it’s impossible. It’s incredibly cruel to still feel all the awful parts of pregnancy once you know it doesn’t “count” anymore.

Before you start TTC, you know people have miscarriages, but (at least for me) I didn’t think about them in much detail. It’s terrible. It’s not “Ok, sorry this one didn’t work, just try again.” You either have to have surgery or painful bleeding. You are set back for months, waiting for your body to heal and your fertility to resume. This happening during COVID seems like an extra slap, as I have to stay quarantined in my depressing house, feeling like the only happy thing in my life is now gone. The fact that time is not on my side due to age doesn’t help.

To add insult to injury, my husband may have to reopen his office next week and may not even be able to take me to my D&amp;C. I am really hoping he can close the office for the day (or at least half a day) because I really want him to take me and not my mom. I wish the universe could just cut me a break just a little bit. I know I am whining and feeling sorry for myself, but I also know you all will understand.

I am actually looking forward to Tuesday because I want the baby out of me. It’s one thing to be sick all day with a live pregnancy, but this is just torture at this point. Thank you all so much for reading.

77,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello all,
 Wanted to give a brief introduction, and also ask a few questions.

I had been pregnant with twins, and at 12 weeks we found out one twin had some major abnormalities. A large cystic hygroma and a Pentology of Cantrell - heart outside the body, basically incompatible with life. We were devastated, but all the doctors told us the second twin was looking great and there was no cause for concern. Sometime in the next week or so, the twin with abnormalities passed in utero. 

I don’t know why, but I became very concerned about the health of the remaining twin and was starting to push for amnio to rule out any other issues. The doctor didn’t really feel it was particularly necessary, all of our measurements on the NT scan had been textbook and all the ultrasound findings up until that point had been normal, but she did offer me an ‘early anatomy scan” at 16 weeks.



It’s at this point everything went all to hell. I went from hoping to find out the gender at the morning scan, to getting a call with terrible findings in the afternoon.


The remaining twin did not look right. It’s long bones were bowed and it’s chest was very small in comparison to the rest of its body. Club feet. Scalloping. Clover shaped skull. Tiny ribs. Ribs that would never continue to grow and allow the lungs to develop. 


She had consulted with 3 other doctors, and they all have the same diagnosis. A lethal skeletal dysplasia. Incompatible with life. We felt like we had somehow been struck by lightening twice.

TFMR was really the only option on the table that felt compassionate, but it was still the hardest thing I ever had to do. I’m 2 weeks into recovering now, and I have some questions that I hope this community might be able to help me with.




For those that have undergone a d&e, how long did you continue to spot for? I had moderate spotting the first few days afterwards, and then it seemed to stop for 2 or 3 days in a row, but will randomly start back up with a bright red spot and then go away all over again. I’m not having any pain associated with it, but the occasional sensation of tightness in muscles around my uterus. Is this my uterus continuing to return to normal size?




My doctor mentioned my first period after the procedure will be unusual, and that I should wait atleast one additional ‘real’ period before trying again, if that’s what we decide to do. Is this because my hormone levels will still be returning to baseline, or some other reason?



We’re waiting on a whole batch of genetic testing results to come in, for both myself and my husband as potential carriers, and for the fetuses to attempt to pinpoint exactly what happened. I want to make sure if we do attempt again in the future, we know what risks are possible. Does anyone here have any suggestions on how to maintain your sanity while waiting for results to come in? 

We’re being put in contact with a genetic counselor for when the results do come in. I’m curious if anyone has any experience with this, and if there’s anything we might want to ask that would otherwise not be as apparent?



To those that have any experience with findings considered incompatible with life, what was your first indication something abnormal was going on? Was it at the nt scan, NIPT, amnio, anatomy scan, etc? At what point did you receive confirmation?

Hi all, I apologize if I'm violating any rules but was unsure where to post or if there were any tags or rules I needed to implement. 
A little background about me: I'm 38 yo and have been trying to conceive #1 since July 2019. I had my first round of Clomid this last cycle, ovulated on Day 13ish, and got a ""late"" positive pregnancy test. I kept testing everyday, posted in TFABlineporn, and assumed I actually ovulated later than I thought, resulting in a later positive. We were overjoyed and cried our eyes out in happiness. I even unsubbed from TFAB and subbed to BabyBumps.
At 6 weeks, I had a few days of very light spotting and extremely bad pelvic  pain on my left side, and on April 30, the ultrasound revealed embryo was in my left fallopian tube and hemorrhaging inside. Now the late positive, pain, etc. all makes sense. 

I had emergency surgery on Thursday to remove the 
embryo. I did not receive any medication injected to induce a miscarriage, just the surgery. 
Today is Wednesday, 6 days post surgery, and I just started bleeding today like my period with some uncomfortable cramping. 
With Covid situation and everything, my doctor hasn't spent that much time explaining everything, and I'm not sure what to expect. I've done a lot of searching here and see a lot of women have had the injection of medication plus surgery. 

Since I'm bleeding now, am I suppose to count this as a period/cycle start, or do I need to wait until this is, ""flushed out"" and then wait for my next period?  At 38, I want to start TTC again soon. We are grieving and can't stand this continued waiting each month or cycle that passes. I want to make sure I know if I've started a new cycle or not, so I can start tracking to ensure I'm ready when it's time to try again in a couple months. 


Any advice is appreciated, as I haven't received much info (oh I was supposed to bleed?) from my Dr on what to expect other than surgery specific info (pain, pain meds, etc.).

I kept testing everyday, posted in TFABlineporn, and assumed I actually ovulated later than I thought, resulting in a later positive. We were overjoyed and cried our eyes out in happiness. I even unsubbed from TFAB and subbed to BabyBumps.
At 6 weeks, I had a few days of very light spotting and extremely bad pelvic  pain on my left side, and on April 30, the ultrasound revealed embryo was in my left fallopian tube and hemorrhaging inside. Now the late positive, pain, etc. all makes sense. </p>

<p>I had emergency surgery on Thursday to remove the 
embryo. I did not receive any medication injected to induce a miscarriage, just the surgery. 
Today is Wednesday, 6 days post surgery, and I just started bleeding today like my period with some uncomfortable cramping. 
With Covid situation and everything, my doctor hasn&#39;t spent that much time explaining everything, and I&#39;m not sure what to expect. I&#39;ve done a lot of searching here and see a lot of women have had the injection of medication plus surgery. </p>

<p>Since I&#39;m bleeding now, am I suppose to count this as a period/cycle start, or do I need to wait until this is, &quot;flushed out&quot; and then wait for my next period?  At 38, I want to start TTC again soon. We are grieving and can&#39;t stand this continued waiting each month or cycle that passes. I want to make sure I know if I&#39;ve started a new cycle or not, so I can start tracking to ensure I&#39;m ready when it&#39;s time to try again in a couple months. </p>

<p>Any advice is appreciated, as I haven&#39;t received much info (oh I was supposed to bleed?) from my Dr on what to expect other than surgery specific info (pain, pain meds, etc.).</p>

<p>Thank you, ladies!</p>

111,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone,

I just signed up to reddit so I could finally join this community. I have been reading posts on here since January which has helped me feel less alone, and I've realised that I could use some additional support by actually interacting with people who are in a similar situation. I'm very grateful that this community exists!

I became pregnant (for the first time) in August 2019  and we had a stressful first trimester because my gynecologtist thought had an ectopic pregnancy so she sent me off to be monitored every 48h in a hospital. It took 9 days (5 ultrasounds & tests for betas) to confirm that it was an intrauterine pregnancy. We saw a different doctor every time and some were more optimistic, while others were pessimistic, so that was an emotional rollercoaster. After that, I had the typical symptoms like nausea, fatigue a stressful time at work, and so I was nervously awaiting the end of the first trimester when I could finally relax. My husband and I decided to go visit our families over the weekend after I reached 13 weeks to announce it to them in person. It's a 6-hour train ride and a different country (we're all in Europe). We take the train on Friday (13+1), arrive late in the evening at my husband's parents' place. We ended up telling them that night, they were very excited, we stay up relatively late, and the next morning at 5:30 am (so officially at 13+2), I wake up in a puddle of blood in the bed and am bleeding through pads very quickly.

We go to the hospital where I am put on bed rest. The bleeding goes down after 2 days and my husband takes the train back home to go back to work while I am sent to my mom's place to stay on bed rest as the travel would be too long. Unfortunately, I never fully stop bleeding and 1.5 weeks later, I have another heavy bleeding and have to go to the hospital again. I'm at 15+2 now and the (young) doctors are telling me I might lose my child because the bleeding is so strong, but all I can do is wait and move as little as possible. I ended up staying in that hospital for 7 weeks, with a fluctuating amount of bleeding. I had massive hematoma due to the bleeding which was coming from the placenta. The pressure from the hematoma ended up rupturing my membranes which further complicated our situation. But our little baby was growing steadily every week, and looking great despite not having much room in there.

Once I reached 21 weeks, the situation was finally looking a little better because the hematoma were almost completely gone and I had stopped bleeding for 1.5 days so now there was only one major thing left to worry about (the ruptured membranes - which would have still required hospitalisation for the remainder of the pregnancy). Unfortunately, a new ward doctor insisted that I re-start taking heparin (a blood thinner used to prevent thrombosis in patients who don't move a lot). My heparin treatment had been paused because of the bleeding and the hematoma, and I had the impression that the heparin had made me bleed more before, so I argued with her about it and said that I wanted to at least wait three more days for the next ultrasound with the senior physician (who I trusted). She was very insistent and implied that I would be gambling with my life (and that of the baby) if I didn't accept the treatment now. In the end I gave in, and I started bleeding almost immediately after receiving the heparin shot. This time, the bleeding was heavier than all the other ones and it didn't slow down after several days. It ended up threatening my life due to the blood loss and significantly worsened the already difficult prognosis of our baby. The doctors strongly recommended inducing birth because that was the only way to stop the bleeding. I felt like I couldn't bring myself to make that decision, but it helped that my husband told me he does not want to live without me. I received blood transfusions to stabilize me before inducing birth.

On January 15th, I gave birth to our little boy. Because everything happened so quickly in the end, we weren't really prepared for meeting him after he was born asleep, but we are so happy that we could hold him and spend some time with him while I was still in the hospital. He was beautiful and he will forever be our first child, who let us feel a love that doesn't compare to anything else.

\----

I have had time to mourn, to talk about it, to heal physically and emotionally. Over time, I feel like I have managed to accept the situation, or at least to be grateful for the gifts that I have been given despite this loss. My husband and I have grown stronger through this experience, and we have been studying Stoic philosophy together which I am very happy about. I have started working from home again one month ago, which is going ok (I sometimes have a hard time being as productive as I used to be).

As most of you here, I have a very strong desire to care for a child, and this was the first month that we have started trying again. I have done tons of tests after the pregnancy which (luckily) all came back negative, so we don't have a cause for what happened. I received the last test results a week ago, and I started being quite emotional again towards the end of last week. May is the month of our son's due date, so it might be related to that. I also started getting nervous about being pregnant again, and being worried about what might happen. Today, I started my period - four days early according to my period tracker app. So today I am extra sad.

Sorry for the wall of text! (if anyone read this far...) I look forward to being part of this community. I hope we can help each other stay positive (if that is what the person is looking for) throughout this journey.

I am 18 days post-ERPC (surgical management) for a MMC.  I remember seeing on the notes for my last scan prior to the MC being diagnosed (a handful of days before the op) that I had two dominant follicles on my left ovary.

I had a private reassurance scan yesterday where the tech said everything was looking good, lining was nice and thick, and although there were still two follicles on the left ovary, one was clearly the properly dominant one now (23mm vs 14mm).  She said it looked like I would ovulate either that day or in the next couple.  We DTD for the first time post-op yesterday.

I have started building back up my OPK supplies, and received an expired (2019/10) CBAD kit from a charlatan on eBay.  eBay gave me my money back and let me keep the kit, so I figured as my first cycle was likely to be screwy and we're NTNP for this cycle, I might as well use it now being that there's nothing to lose, and it's better than just throwing it in the bin.  I appreciate I'm not using it correctly (i.e. the day you are meant to start testing) but just thought what the hey.

This morning I have used the kit and it's gone straight to peak!  I was under the impression that it was physically impossible for this to happen, in that the first day you use the kit would always be the empty circle as the holder is setting your 'baseline' levels.

So some questions:

\- Do you think I'm actually about to ovulate, or is the kit just picking up some trace HCG which I know can give the same result when looking for LH? (I haven't gotten a fully negative HPT yesterday)

\- Is it OK for those two follicles to have been hanging around for this long?  Unfortunately there were no measurements on the notes from pre-op, otherwise I'd feel a bit more relaxed that they have been growing over this time.  I know follicular phase can be a bit delayed in post-MC cycles.

Obviously everything is wait and see, and if it doesn't work this time, we'll just re-set again once I get my first period.

TLDR; CBAD went straight to peak on my first day using it after MC; apparantly I'm about to ovulate soon, but worried that the follicle is old?

So I have PCOS and have been TTC for over a year now. Long story short, a few days before my initial appointment with an RE, I found out I was pregnant (unmedicated!!! Yay!). Obviously, I was thrilled but cautiously optimistic. Flash forward to my 8 week appointment and I found out I had a blighted ovum (meaning, baby stopped developing very early on but the gestational sac and placenta were still developing). Without any details, I am no longer pregnant and I feel like I should be more sad than I am.

So I have PCOS and have been TTC for over a year now. Long story short, a few days before my initial appointment with an RE, I found out I was pregnant (unmedicated!!! Yay!). Obviously, I was thrilled but cautiously optimistic. Flash forward to my 8 week appointment and I found out I had a blighted ovum (meaning, baby stopped developing very early on but the gestational sac and placenta were still developing). Without any details, I am no longer pregnant and I feel like I should be more sad than I am. I was obviously really sad when I found out but 2 days out and I am feeling fine and like I have accepted it. Am I wrong? Should I be more sad? </p>

I had an ectopic pregnancy in December 2019. I had no risk factors or preexisting conditions and was successfully treated with methotrexate. I had a FemVue in March 2020 that showed clear tubes. I successfully conceived after that procedure and am in the process of a loss that is either a CP or another ectopic, my OB is currently unsure of which one (I will spare you the details, but there are reasons why it could be either), and does not believe that we will ever know what type of loss this is.

The mystery of what type of loss this was has left me confused about next steps. I’m wondering if anyone further along in their TTC after journey has had a similar  situation and what you did. Here is what my options are:

1. Remove Fallopian tube where I had my previous ectopic (this would probably be the best option if my second loss was also  an ectopic.  There was a “solid mass” found in the exact location where I had my previous ectopic but the structure of the mass is inconsistent with ectopics and it has no tubal ring or circumferential flow so my OB is thinking that it could potentially be scar tissue that was somehow missed during her FemVue) and TTC again.

2. Simply TTC again when the current loss is complete 

3. Automatically try IVF with or without removing the right tube 

For context: my husband and I have been trying for 7 months, we have experienced 2 losses in this time (and I’m 34). Our health insurance will cover 4 IVF attempts if we go down that route.

I am am generally a positive person, so I am hoping to stay as positive as I can through this, however I am still processing my losses so I am also hoping to take the least emotionally charged route. At this point, all options feel like a potential emotional minefield.

I’m just curious about timing of your cycles after a MC.  

After my first CP, I had a 31 day cycle (my average is 28 days). That cycle I didn’t track ovulation because I was so devastated and wasn’t ready to try again.

Now my period is 3 days late - so I’m on day 32 of my cycle (confirmed I’m not pregnant with a test but I just knew anyway), with no real symptoms that it’s coming any time soon.

Looking back it seems so evident to me that things weren't right but everyone kept essentially gaslighting me. Both HPT's I took were very light, everyone told me that the darkness of the line doesn’t mean anything (not true) and that I must have gotten my conception date wrong (how could I get it that wrong while I was tracking?). When I started bleeding everyone said ""oh I had light bleeding in early pregnancy, it was nbd"". When my first HCG came back very low I was told ""one beta doesn’t mean anything"" when my next one didn’t double it was again ""maybe you got your O date wrong?"". I didn't have any normal pregnancy symptoms approaching 6 weeks, again apparently totally normal.

For weeks I knew deep down something was absolutely not right and everyone kept telling me I was overreacting. It made me hold onto hope and I think made it much harder when I went in for a scan and clearly saw the mass in my tube. Even then I still had hope the midwife was going to come in and tell me everything was fine since the technician said nothing.

Then, I got to see my baby on transvaginal US and hear a healthy heartbeat (measuring 8+3, I was almost 10 weeks but I didn’t know my exact ovulation so the doctor and I assumed I ovulated later, no biggie).This is when we began to feel it was real and started telling our families... a day later the bleeding began... and since I am here, you know how the story ends. My very first pregnancy ended in a natural MC. 

Hcg levels returned to baseline four weeks after. Got my period almost exactly 7 weeks after the MC. Seemed to be a pretty normal period minus two days of light brown spotting. 

I feel optimistic but deep down have a fear of this happening again.

On a few days I went out for a tiny walk (like literally 5 minutes) or just a little stroll in the garden, but I didn't have the energy for much more.  After about a week I was feeling much better, and my post-op bleeding had lessened a lot, down to a few drops of brown that can easily be contained by one pantyliner for a day.

I had not done any proper exercise for many weeks (was too scared during pregnancy) and so I was keen to get back into the swing of things ASAP.  I did some research and everything I could find said that you can start exercising once you feel OK in yourself.

So, yesterday I went out for a jog/walk for quite a while; I had the usual aches/pains afterwards, but noticed that my stomach (uterus?) seemed a bit tender when pressed.  I hoped it might just be my stomach muscles, but in honesty the tenderness seemed internal, not in the muscle layer.  I've done the same thing again this morning and the same thing has happened, to a slightly greater degree (possibly because exercised two days in a row?).  The tenderness yesterday faded away after a few hours, so is this just related to the fact that I'm exercising, and when I'm moving things are 'jiggling around' inside?  Or could it be my stomach muscles squeezing/pressing against my uterus?

I'm just a bit worried because I've read that one of the signs of infection is tenderness.  I obviously don't want to set back my progress, but on the other hand, I'm really enjoying the exercise and it's helping me a lot.  Aside from this, I don't have any other symptoms that could suggest infection, exercise doesn't seem to make the little bleeding I have any worse, and I feel fine.  To emphasize, the tenderness has only occurred since I've started exercising.

I will call the hospital tomorrow regardless to get their opinion, and I'll take a break from doing anything that day too, but just looking for anyone's personal experience of resuming exercise after having gone through this, and/or some reassurance if anyone can provide it here.

I wish none of us had to experience the things we’ve gone through, but I’m thankful this sub exists. You all are so supportive and your presence makes me feel less alone. 

My husband and I are ttc again and it’s the third cycle post my D & E without any luck. We really thought it was going to work this time, so this failed cycle has me feeling hopeless. I know it can take some time, but we got pregnant on the third cycle last time, so I worry that something happened during my procedure or that my body is damaged in some way now. May is also when our daughter should have been born, so I’m feeling extra anxiety. 

Everyone’s experience and body is so different, so I know it’s hard to compare, but if you had to TFMR, would you be willing to share your stats for the following?

* How old were you?
* What number pregnancy was it? If not the first, did you have any issues with previous pregnancies? 
* What week did you TFMR? Did you have a D & E or something else?
* how many cycles did it take to get pregnant before your TFMR?
* how many cycles did it take to get pregnant after your TFMR? Was it successful? 

I’ll kick it off with my own info:

* 33
* first pregnancy
* 18 weeks / D & E
* 3
* 3 and still counting...

I feel some sense of guilt for what happened. I think about what I done wrong. Did my weight cause this? Did i drink too much caffeine?

We tried just about everything none invasive before we arrived at the conclusion that we need to seek infertility treatment. We had one failed IUI and two failed FET before I was tested positive at home after the third FET last night. I tracked 50 cycles and I thought maybe cycle 51 would be that magic number. 

I ugly cried, snots and tears were all over the place but I was so happy that I couldn’t wait to share the excitement. Knowing that it’s too early to share with family and friends, I chose to share with internet strangers on r/happy. 

People were supportive and I was feeling over the moon when I went to bed, planning on going to see the doctor the next day. But around 5:30 this morning, I just jumped out of bed knowing something was wrong. I rushed into the bathroom and I saw heavy bleeding. Right away, I went to the ER. After examination and ultrasound, it was confirmed that I indeed had a miscarriage. I know all the stats, the risk, the chances, but that doesn’t mean it hurt any less. There was worrisome no symptoms prior to it happening. 

I would have gotten a beta test at the hospital but due to country wide lockdown at the time, there was no public transportation, not even taxis, it’d been difficult and expensive for me to return. I figured the lockdown was going to be lifted and transportation would resume on the 24th, I can wait a few more days to find out at home. I ran out of estrogen and progesterone on the 20th, and after talking to my father who’s a doctor, he said it’s completely ok to go without them for four days since I have no alarming symptoms. This morning I was supposed to have my first pregnancy appointment, instead I was in the ER for the miscarriage. How very cruel is this coincidence.

Husband and I have been TTC for 11 Cycles (currently in TWW, first cycle post CP). The CP was the only time I've seen a positive test. Friend's pregnancy announcement yesterday sent me into a tailspin and I basically cried myself to sleep.

Has anyone else started to doubt if TTC is good idea? This whole situation (particularly the last month) has wreaked havoc with my mental health and I'm not even sure I want to do this anymore, but I don't know how to switch it off in my brain. For nearly a year I haven't gone to the bathroom without thinking ""should I be doing an OPK?"".  I know that now, if I ever get to see a positive test again, I'm going to be a nervous wreck. I've always imagined I'd really enjoy pregnancy and now it just seems like 9 months of panic. I read stories of couples who have tried for much longer, or gone through so much ""more"" or objectively ""worse"" loss than us and I feel like a total weakling. If I'm not strong enough to get through this then am I actually strong enough to be someone's Mum?

I've wanted to be a Mum since I knew what a Mum was. This taking a while feels like a huge personal failure and I'm really struggling. Before this whole COVID situation I had initial bloodwork that came back normal, and we were planning on getting an SA, but that's now on hold. We've since had our positive and we've got the OK from our GP to be referred to a specialist once everything is ""back to normal"", but who knows when that will be.

242,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone - 
It seems like it is time for me to come back here after a long hiatus. I've tagged this as an ""Intro"" post, but I was very active in this sub from 2015 - 2017 when TTC #1. This post is likely going to be long - I haven't been here for a while and I feel like I have a lot to get out. 

I began TTC in 2015 and I had 3 early losses (CPs and 1 ectopic that lasted 3 months and had to be resolved with various procedures and methotrexate). My first was especially hard because my bff/cousin got pregnant the week I was losing the pregnancy and told me on my birthday (wtf)...but as it kept happening I sought out help from this sub and an RE. This sub and so many of the people in it literally saved my sanity. I still talk to a small group of the friends I have from this sub every single day. 

I had basically every test under the sun (including expensive karyotyping and a surgery to remove a uterine polyp and check my tubes) and everything came back normal. Although several docs poo-poo'd the idea of baby aspirin, I decided to take it on my own and give it one last hoorah before either doubling down and doing medicated cycles or giving up altogether. At the time I didn't realize why, but the baby aspirin worked and that cycle resulted in my son. My pregnancy was uncomplicated other than developing severe pre-eclampsia at the end. 

Fast forward two years and we decide to casually TTC#2. I got pregnant quickly and it ended after some spotting similar to my other losses occurred and I asked for an ultrasound. All that could be seen on ultrasound was a gestational sac and I was close to 6-7 weeks so I knew it was not good. 

I saw an MFM doc for my pregnancy with my son, so I saw again when I got pregnant that time. When it ended in loss, he still saw me for a ""pre-conception consultation"" and he did what he called a ""shotgun of tests"" on me. He also hilariously said ""I am looking at your neck, you have kind of a thick neck...have you had your thyroid tested?"" to which I said ""yeah and it's normal""...this man has the worst bedside manner on the planet and I joke about my thick neck constantly now. So thanks to him for that? WELL...TURNS OUT DR BAD BEDSIDE MANNER WAS RIGHT...I have elevated TPO-antibodies, so Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. No one tested me for that in the years I was TTC and visiting REs. Also, as he literally handed me my bloodwork results via individual pieces of paper, said, ""AND THE BIG ONE - Lupus Anti-coagulant Antibody!"", which was a shocker to me. I was negative for this in 2016 and it came back positive in 2019. So I have apparently have Hashimoto's and Antiphospholipid Syndrome. 

It was like in an instant I had an explanation for my losses, for all of the pain, the unanswered EVERYTHING, my body being a troll and a failure...it felt so redemptive to HAVE A REASON. A scientific medical reason that is a documented and well known reason for pregnancy loss. And the treatment - baby fucking aspirin and lovenox injections. NO BIGGIE. CAN DO! It also clued me in as to why my pregnancy with my son worked out while the others did not (baby aspirin alone seemed to work that time). 

After getting my answer, I had a lot of hope that loss was behind me. In addition to all of these losses, my cycles are quite irregular and so sometimes I have to wait til CD 30+ for O, which is so frustrating. We decided to give it a go on our own before jumping into medicated cycles. I did twice daily lovenox injections in my stomach and baby aspirin for 4-5 months and eventually got pregnant. I was sick as a dog, so damn nauseous, and the pregnancy mirrored my one that worked out very closely, almost to the day as far as symptoms go. My husband was so hopeful. I had an early scan and they saw all the right things, but it was a little early for a heartbeat. The next appointment, at 8 weeks, there was no heartbeat. My nausea was so bad and my body would not initiate bleeding so I decided to get a D&C simply to end the nausea. This was December 2019. 

Last month we decided to try a medicated cycle (femara) and I responded well to it. We decided to do baby aspirin preconception and lovenox shots upon a positive test. I got pregnant, started lovenox, but my betas eventually dropped and that one ended, too. So I am 6 losses in, 3 prior to my LC and 3 post. The treatments that are recommended for my issues have not worked for me, twice now. And then COVID happened and my RE stopped all new cycles. 

I don't know where to go from here. I'm almost completely numb. I don't have tears left. The losses are so clinical and normalized for me. I didn't even cry when I found out about the last 2. I'm so fortunate that they have all been early. When I'm in the middle of loss, I swear I can't handle it again and I'm done, only for it to end and I find myself wanting to try again and get right back on the horse. As most of you in this sub probably are, I am a planner and the whole ""just see what happens"" simply doesn't work for me. 

Well, if you have made it this far, thanks for reading. I've glossed over many parts of this 5 year journey, but this is the gist. I am going to try to dive back into this community and thought I should introduce myself, albeit in a long-winded way.

I'm new to this community and to reddit in general, so apologies if I post in the wrong spots or misunderstood any rules.  I recently had a missed miscarriage at 11 weeks and a D&C in March, and a friend I shared my story with referred me here, a place that helped her after she experienced pregnancy loss.  

I'm really terrified to try again, because even seeing ultrasounds on TV makes my heart race at the moment.  Too bad I've been rewatching ER virtually with my Mom...maybe it will help me build up to actually being able to get one without panicking if I am fortunate enough to become pregnant again...here's hoping.

This pandemic also has me stressed about the idea of conceiving too...how are other people feeling about it?  I think I may ovulate in a few days, so I'm unsure of what to do.  Everything is so uncertain right now.  

Anyway, I was feeling really alone until I shared with others about my experience, and I'm hoping for more of that as I think about trying to become pregnant again.  Not many people who are close to me have been through this, so it's hard for my usual support people to relate and to comfort me as I process everything.  

Anyway, that is my introduction post.  I'm sure I've already violated some unwritten (or written and not seen by me) rule about lengthy messages!
