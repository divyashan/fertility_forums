My boyfriend introduced me to a lovely friend of his a few years ago, let’s call her “A”,  successful nursing career, confident, nice house and car, 4 year old son and in a happy relationship with the father. 

Anyway, “W” “A” and her boyfriend had a threesome and she caught feelings for “W” she eventually left her boyfriend and her and “W” became official. 

I remember her telling me that she would never get into a relationship with “W” because of his meth use.

She lost her job.
Then her car.
Then her house. 
She’s pregnant. 
Her and “W” spend their days smoking meth.
She is fully addicted now. 
“W” has started hitting her (too often) because she’s smoking meth and “hurting the baby” 

They spent the night at ours on Saturday and they were obviously high, he started hitting her and going off at her. We spent the night trying to “council” them and break up the fights every hour. We had to kick then out at 5AM because they were being too
crazy. 
The next day they visited and act like nothing happened.
We have tried to help and speak some sense into them but they just don’t seem to care.

My DH and I started our TTC journey in May of 2017 at the age of 26 (both of us are the same age). We were pretty laid back and thought ""we'll take it slow and if it happens, it happens"". Well it didn't take long because we got our BFP in June. Meanwhile, at work, a girl who is a couple years younger than me announced that she was pregnant (she was 2 weeks farther along than I was). A little background on this girl - she was 23 years old and a heavy smoker. She had no drivers license because it had been taken away due to 2 underage DUIs. The second DUI totaled her truck and put her in the hospital. In response she got a huge RIP tattoo on her ribs in memory of her truck. She was unmarried (I know that it is becoming more common to see unmarried mothers and that's ok, but I am just more traditional in how I do things. In this case she was in a long-term relationship but didn't want to marry the guy because he had an outrageous amount of debt and didn't want to take that on by getting married. So in this case by unmarried I more mean it wasn't a stable environment that is needed for having a baby), but in a relationship with a man whose previous marriage she broke up (he had 3 kids from this previous marriage too). She was also very rude and and over-all terrible human being. She decided that she ""wasn't getting any younger"" so she might as well have a baby. Our due dates were 2 weeks apart. Hubby and I hadn't told anyone except our parents and my sister. We figured it would be better to keep it to ourselves until I was further along.

 I had my first appointment at the end of July. We went into it so excited. It didn't take long for me to become attached to my future child. I guess I didn't realize how excited I was to become a mom until I saw that ""Pregnant"" clear as day on the digital test. I was 10 weeks, or so they thought, at my appointment. When the doc couldn't hear the heartbeat I got nervous, but she said they must have just estimated wrong and I wasn't as far along as they thought. She sent me for a trans-vaginal ultrasound. During the ultrasound we saw the tiny little blob that was our baby, we even got to see the heartbeat. I was so in love with this little dot. This was my future. This was on a Thursday. The following Tuesday (August 1st, 2017) I started bleeding and cramping so I called the nurse line. They said it was normal, but if it got worse to call back. Well it got worse. They told me to come in immediately for the MICRhoGAM shot since my husband was O+ and I am A-. So I left work and headed to the hospital. I called by DH and told him to meet me there, as I was a nervous wreck since this was our first pregnancy. They saw me right away and gave me the shot. The nurse told me to go home, take it easy and try to relax. By the time we got home the cramps were awful so I curled up on the couch and tried to calm down. My DH had to run an errand and told me he'd make it quick so he could get back to me. After he left the bleeding and cramps got really intense, and I was now loosing large clots of blood. I broke down and was sobbing on the couch when my husband got home. I knew what was happening but didn't want to believe it. We called the after hours nurse line and they told me I could go to the ER or wait till the next morning to see my OB. My OB happened to be the on-call OB at the hospital that night and agreed to meet with us after her shift and told me to get another ultrasound before coming to her office. The whole night I was in tears. I had never been in so much pain, the cramps were so intense. I had a heating pad on all night, but it didn't really help much. I texted my boss and said I had an appointment in the morning and might not make it in the next day.

We went in for the ultrasound and the tech was so quiet. We didn't see our little blob this time. There was nothing, absolutely nothing. I had to hold back tears as we sat in the waiting room, waiting for my OB to finish her shift. We got called back to the room and the nurse was very quiet and simply told us the doctor would be in shortly. I couldn't hold it in anymore and by the time the doctor came in I was nearly sobbing again. She didn't try and BS us or patronize us, she simply said ""I am so sorry"" before giving me a hug. We were told that there was nothing left in my uterus, everything had passed naturally overnight. She told us that it was nothing we did wrong and that my body must have known that there was something wrong and terminated the pregnancy naturally. I was devastated. I texted my boss and confirmed that I would not be going in. We went home and I cried....a lot. When I wasn't crying I felt oddly numb. I could not stop thinking, ""how could this have happened to us"", ""I must have done something wrong"", ""maybe if I had/hadn't done (insert action) this wouldn't have happened"". I thought for sure I had done everything right. I was at a healthy weight (the lowest I had been in years), I was eating right, I quit caffeine, I was exercising more. 

Work became unbearable. I had to go in every day and see this other girl who despite smoking, terrible eating habits, and overall horrible attitude getting to have a normal, healthy pregnancy. She continued to smoke through the entire pregnancy and indulged her every craving (healthy or not), while I had to try and keep my world from falling apart. I was depressed. I felt like I had lost my whole world. I know I still had my husband and family, but I still felt empty. It felt like something was missing. For some reason I couldn't help but fixate on her. I know it was irrational and would only make me feel worse, but I couldn't help it. She had what I wanted, and she didn't deserve it. Why? Why did something so horrific happen to me, but she got to keep her baby.  

Fast forward to March 2018 - she had her baby. My ""due date"" came and went. We started TTC again with my next cycle. No luck. We haven't been able to conceive since. And every month, negative test after negative test, I just get more discouraged. I just want to be a mother. In a mouth I will be 27, another year older, and still no closer to my goal. It doesn't help that my birthday falls on Mother's day. It will just be one more reminder of what I don't have. My husband and I have just started the process of infertility testing. We have only filled out a medical history questionnaire (no appointments yet) but it all just seems so daunting, especially since there is no guarantee that it will help.

For those of you who took the time to read this extremely long post, thank you for listening to me rant. My husband found this subreddit for me and it has made me feel a bit better knowing there are people out there who feel the same way I do right now (unfortunately) and makes me feel a little less ""alone"" than I have been.

I went on a business trip last week.  AF hadn’t come so I picked up a test and got a positive FRER. I retest two days later and I’m still getting a positive but it’s fainter.  Next day I’m cramping and bleeding, go to an urgent care while I’m 3,000 miles from home.

Of course when I got the positive test I excitedly called DH because we’ve been trying for 8 months.  When the line is fainter I’m concerned and call him. When I start bleeding I call him very emotional.

I was excited, then scared and alone and I wanted his support.

I get home and we get into a huge fight because according to him I shouldn’t have told him anything until I saw the words pregnant on a digital test because that’s when it’s real and not “some voodoo shit line tests”.  And calling him so much and being in such a panic really threw his week off and what could he have done from so far away.

I’m still bleeding, my HCG is close to zero according to latest blood draw and we are just ignoring anything ever happened.

Because he didn’t see the words pregnant on a digital I have to deal with this myself and I should apologize for being so panicky and causing him distress.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’m looking for. I’m really sad and don’t know if I have the right to be, because maybe he is right.

Just hoping someone has some advice.

I just recently loss my second baby to pPROM. Feeling a little lost and discouraged. My TTC journey started in 2016, my husband and I were able to get pregnant on our second cycle trying. Went in for the 8 week appointment and discovered a blighted ovum. We had to have a D&C and we started trying again.

Six months later I got pregnant with our son, Lane. The pregnancy was completely normal until it wasn’t. I started cramping around 21 weeks and didn’t realize I was in labor until I started bleeding. By the time we got to the hospital I was fully dialated. My water eventually broke and Lane was born at 21w5d on 04/30/17. He was with us for a couple hours before he passed away. The doctors discovered an infection in my amniotic fluid which caused the preterm labor. All our doctors described it as a fluke and was unlikely to happen again as my cervix was completely healthy and so was Lane. My body was just trying to get rid of the infection and our boy was just caught in the middle. 

Another 6 months after we lost Lane I became pregnant again. This time with our daughter. I was on progesterone from weeks 6-13 and went in for weekly checks. Once again everything looked normal and healthy. At 19 weeks my water broke early after waking up. I didn’t go into labor until 20w6d and our daughter was born on 04/09/18. We named her Arly and she was the exact same size and length as Lane. She joined her brother in heaven about 3 hours after she was born. There was no infection this time. The doctors have no reason as to why my water broke. Again my cervix was long and closed up until I went into labor so they don’t believe it is incompetent cervix. 

I am just so lost. I want to start trying again but I feel like my body keeps failing my children. Why can’t I get passed 21 weeks? My babies are normal and healthy I just can’t seem to keep them long enough so they can get large enough to survive. We will be going to a MFM doctor this time around and will be getting all the tests done that go with these kinds of losses. I guess I am just looking for some hope from this group as right now I feel completely hopeless. Thanks for listening to my story.

Our families were so excited.  This was to be my in-laws first grandchild.  My first trimester was not great.  I had really bad morning sickness, was treated at the ER for morning sickness and lost 15 pounds.  I also went off my antidepressants for the pregnancy and suffered from severe anxiety.  For months i could only manage to work and then crash at home.  I felt so useless but we knew it was for our baby and would be worth it in the end, especially when we heard the heartbeat at 12 weeks.

At my 16 week appointment she couldn't find a heartbeat so did a handheld ultrasound.  We saw two babies. She couldn't see the heartbeat but said the babies were in a bad position and to come in later for an actual ultrasound.  My husband and I were thrilled to be having twins.  We would complete our family in one try. 

My husband and I came in the next day for a true ultrasound.  I knew something wasn't right.  The tech didn't say anything and wouldn't show me the screen.  She left to go get the doctor.  My husband saw her label the pictures as baby A, B and C.  He was so excited and supportive of triplets, but i still knew something wasn't right.  I still wasn't prepared when the doctor confirmed that none of the babies had a heartbeat or movement.  In less than 48 hours we went from one baby to two to three and then none.  

We chose a D and E as i could not have handled induction.  The procedure went well but I still had heavy bleeding a few days later.  Ended up back in the hospital for a D and C as they were concerned about remaining tissue.  Turned out to be a lot of blood clots that my uterus wasn't expelling due to its size from having triplets.  It is now finally back to normal and i have stopped spotting.  

It's so hard not to feel guity about feeling better and being able to eat again.  The last few months seem such a waste and now we will have t0 start at square one again.  Sorryt his is so long, just needed to share.  This week should have been my 20 week ultrasound.

<p>At my 16 week appointment she couldn&#39;t find a heartbeat so did a handheld ultrasound.  We saw two babies. She couldn&#39;t see the heartbeat but said the babies were in a bad position and to come in later for an actual ultrasound.  My husband and I were thrilled to be having twins.  We would complete our family in one try. </p>

<p>My husband and I came in the next day for a true ultrasound.  I knew something wasn&#39;t right.  The tech didn&#39;t say anything and wouldn&#39;t show me the screen.  She left to go get the doctor.  My husband saw her label the pictures as baby A, B and C.  He was so excited and supportive of triplets, but i still knew something wasn&#39;t right.  I still wasn&#39;t prepared when the doctor confirmed that none of the babies had a heartbeat or movement.  In less than 48 hours we went from one baby to two to three and then none.  </p>

<p>We chose a D and E as i could not have handled induction.  The procedure went well but I still had heavy bleeding a few days later.  Ended up back in the hospital for a D and C as they were concerned about remaining tissue.  Turned out to be a lot of blood clots that my uterus wasn&#39;t expelling due to its size from having triplets.  It is now finally back to normal and i have stopped spotting.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s so hard not to feel guity about feeling better and being able to eat again.  The last few months seem such a waste and now we will have t0 start at square one again.  Sorryt his is so long, just needed to share.  This week should have been my 20 week ultrasound.  </p>

54,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Background:  this past December I had a missed miscarriage that was discovered at my first ultrasound at almost 10 weeks.  I elected to have a D&C.  It was my first major surgery, but thankfully everything went smoothly and I recovered quickly.  So while the whole thing was shocking and sad, compared to many experiences I have read on here it was pretty easy.

We waited two full cycles and then started trying again.  On my second cycle trying, I got pregnant.  Yesterday, at 5+2, I started bleeding.  It became heavy and I started passing clots.  I knew it was over- I felt my few pregnancy symptoms disappear.  While it was more traumatic to actually experience the miscarriage, I thought that overall it would be just as easy to recover from, if not easier because it was earlier.

Apparently that is not the case.  I went to the doctor this morning and had an exam and trans-vaginal ultrasound.  They told me they can't see the sac and they didn't see anything else to cause alarm in there, which is good.  However I have to keep an eye on how things are progressing and get my HCG levels checked over the next few days and then go in for a follow up appointment to make sure things are clearing out properly.

A question- he said once they have confirmed that my levels have dropped, he wants me to stop taking my prenatal vitamin until I get my next period.  Anyone have any experience with that?  I didn't ask him why- information overload at that particular moment.  I'm concerned because I was advised to take my prenatals for a few months before starting TTC to let them build up in my system.   

Interestingly enough, the day before this occurred I told my husband that if we lost this baby, I wanted to go on a trip before we tried again- I knew I would need something tangible to look forward to to get me through it.  Guess I was having a little premonition there, because now I definitely need something to focus on before I lose my grip completely.  We have to wait until school is over to go on the trip, so it will be a few months for sure before we start trying again.

Emotionally it's easier because it was earlier and it's not my first loss, but physically it's so much harder.  I'm terrified that something will go wrong from here.  Then if I do get pregnant again, I will be 37 when I give birth.  The clock is ticking so loud.  Not to mention- what the heck is going on with my body and these lost babies??  It's all so overwhelming.

We planned to have lunch afterwards then go visit my family with our pregnancy announcement gifts.

They didn’t find the baby on the ultrasound, only a huge abnormal placenta. The sac where baby was had mostly been absorbed by it. I was sent to my OB for an emergency appointment.

I had none of the symptoms or risk factors for a rare Partial Molar Pregnancy, but there it was.

I went with the D&amp;amp;C because there is a small risk that this is a sign of cancer (choriocarcinomas), so the remains have to be sent to the lab. I didn’t want to collect them and bring them in myself. My OB was able to do it yesterday afternoon.

Yesterday I felt so shocked and numb. Today I woke up feeling so... alone. Empty.

I have an appointment next week to discuss the lab results, hopefully no cancer. Then I need to go back regularly to monitor my hCG levels and ensure they fall. My doctor also advises me to wait until after I’ve had one full regular cycle to TTC again. So June maybe?

We began TTC in June last year.

However, money is now a problem. This will potentially be the second year in a row that we have to pay the full insurance deductible / out of pocket (OOP) maximum for me. Last year I went to the ER for a large ovarian cyst and had it surgically removed. I had the full OOP amount saved up in my HSA account to pay for pregnancy, not a cyst. It was very difficult to make those payments. So we were paying on a payment plan as we went for the pregnancy. We will likely have to continue that payment plan for the D&amp;amp;C costs. We were going to have to be very frugal/thrifty buying stuff for having a baby. I’m not sure it would be possible to buy those things and also start a payment plan towards my 2019 OOP maximum.

I hate healthcare in the United States. I feel like I’m waiting for the sky to fall when the bills for the surgeon, hospital, and anesthesiologist to arrive.

**Anyhow, I’m 33 and have been trying to have a baby since June ‘17.

104,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"So I haven't posted in a little while because I haven't known how to put this into words. I've been grappling with the news over the last 2 or so months and it's been hard.

Sometime in February I went in to my doctor's office because I was growing concerned. We were at month 7 of TTC after our miscarriage and had had no luck. For my husband and I, that's weird. As my post history will show, my living son was a second cycle success, our loss was an oops ""didn't pull out in time, but we are breastfeeding! We should probably be fine!"" pregnancy. So anything beyond a couple months is abnormal for our history (albeit anecdotal). So she suggested we do some bloodwork with my cycle on specific days (day 3 and day 21 if I remember correctly) and to do a full pelvic ultrasound, and while we were there, lets do the pap smear. 

Well bloodwork all came back normal, or within range, pap came back normal (had been having issues with pain/bleeding after sex which was a little concerning) and then we did the ultrasound. Well let me tell you, when the ultrasound tech goes ""have you not had any follow up U/S since May last year...?"" you know there's something going on. Then when you have a voicemail from your doctor's office within 2 hours of completing said U/S you *really* know something is up... 

Well talked to the nurse and they told me I had a ""significantly sized cyst on my right ovary when compared to May 2017"". They couldn't tell by the U/S images what it was specifically but it started my head spinning and making me want to just cry and throw up and just curl in a ball and die. They wanted to send me for an MRI, get the referral in to a local OB/GYN for possible surgery to remove it. I of course have to ask the question - ""is it possibly cancer?"" because I have a 2 year old at home and I want to kind of get my life in order because I'm aware that ovarian cancer is kinda a big deal. I also have a house and car loans and bills, and if I can't work I need to get all *that* stuff in order too.

Well the nurse, bless her, said she couldn't say it *wasn't* cancer but was *pretty sure* it wasn't cancer. They think it's either a cyst related to endometriosis (so blood filled) or a dermoid cyst. Either way MRI is needed to get a better idea of what exactly it is, and how dangerous it is in terms of my ovary and tube etc doing funky things. 

Fast forward about 2 weeks and I see the OB/GYN and he's the same one who saved my life with my son when I was brutally sick with HG and nearly died from dehydration/malnutrition and other complications related to 6 weeks of throwing up constantly and not eating/drinking. He took into account everything that has gone on in the last year and said he was going to give me his ""three for one special!"" (I love this doctor. He's been around forever, is now working with nurses in the L&D that he DELIVERED and is now delivering some of their babies too! He's literally seen everything). He's going to do the laparoscopic surgery to remove the cyst, and look at everything else (to confirm whether or not I have endo, and presumably treat endo if present and requires treatment) and while he's in there, they are going to do a D&C to hard reset my uterus, and while they are all up in my business already, they'll flush both my fallopian tubes and make sure there isn't anything wrong with them that's causing my sudden infertility issues. Basically he's hitting the hard reset button on my baby makers!

However, in the meantime I cannot try for a baby. There have been many many many tears shed over this. If I manage to get pregnant before the MRI there are concerns since they need to use contrast for the MRI, there is concern about having the surgery to remove the cyst if I am pregnant (obviously the D&C and tube flush wouldn't happen if I was pregnant) so they don't want us even trying to get pregnant. So we have minimum 2 more months before we even enter the surgical stage of this whole clusterfuck and then the 6-8 week minimum recovery time to start trying. So we are looking at likely June/July at the earliest before we can start trying again.

I'm angry, I'm upset, I'm sad. I'm lost. I wanted to be pregnant before we hit a year from our miscarriage (which will be 1 year in like 2 weeks) yet here I am in limbo. Had the OB who took ""care"" of us during the miscarriage been a better doctor, and actually been useful and made me want to go to appointments then maybe we would have treated this cyst A YEAR AGO when it was first found! Instead my records from the care he gave us, never got forwarded to my GP, so even my family doctor didn't know what was going on, and still doesn't, and maybe I would be pregnant now, or already holding a baby. Shit, I don't know what this cyst is, we don't know what it means yet for my fertility. Will I lose the ovary? Will it actually turn out to be cancer? Will I have to endure chemo and more surgery and more time waiting for my rainbow baby? Hell, will I be allowed to safely have a second child of my own if I end up with cancer? Since this has been going on for nearly a year without any monitoring, will I even be okay? Is this going to be something that ends up killing me? Leave my husband a widower? My child without a mother, my mother without her daughter etc etc? 

There is a part of me that wants to go after this old OB for how he handled everything should this cyst end up being damaging to my life. Make sure he doesn't do this to anyone else ever again. Take away my ability to have children or maybe enjoy watching my son grow up. I just can't wrap my head around how this was allowed to happen.

So things have not be going so great for me emotionally; basically I have a very short fuse, and I have been feeling very down, when I am not totally high-strung anxious. I have had bouts of anxiety and depression off and on since I was a teenager, and although I consider myself pretty high-functioning, my miscarriage has of course only made these more acute. 

I went to my therapist today and she suggested I look into getting on some medication for my mental health. Her thought is that since I am sleeping enough, eating well, exercising, making an effort to connect with my friends, not drinking or using drugs, not in any sort of abusive relationship, etc, there could be something up with my brain chemistry that is making me feel worse. She says that studies show it is better to treat mental health issues than not in TTC/pregnancy, and suggested that I ask my OB/GYN what they think. I am open to the idea because honestly I am pretty damn sick of feeling the way I have been feeling. I realize that taking a pill is not going to solve all my problems, but if it helps, it might be worth it. Hell, maybe it will help me to ""just relaaaaax"" like people keep telling me to do.

As we’ve moved all over the country, changed schools, and changed jobs, we’ve gone through long periods of time without talking much. Even now, we usually talk only once or twice a month. But we’ve always been each others’ number one. She was the first non-family member I told when I was pregnant, and three months later, she was the first non-family member I told that I needed a TFMR.

And so, I was disappointed, to say the least, by the following text exchange we had last night:

————————————————————

Friend: *sends photo of her sister’s newborn baby* [her sister and I were pregnant at the same time]

Friend: I'm an aunt! [Baby’s name] born yesterday.  Almost 10 lbs. 

Me: Congrats! Big baby. He's beautiful.

Friend: So big. Not sure how she managed to push him out. She did say epidurals are awesome though. 

Me: nice--glad it helped her

————————————————————

Obviously I’m happy she told me about her new baby nephew, and I’m so thrilled for her. But am I expecting too much to want her to demonstrate a bit more sensitivity? I wish she had just acknowledged the fact that it must be hard for me to see newborn babies when my own is in an urn in my living room. Or maybe she could have just followed up by asking how I’ve been doing. 

I’m debating whether to say something. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t hesitate to call her out. But I don’t want to taint this moment of happiness for her. Just because I’m miserable doesn’t mean everyone else needs to be.

What are your expectations for family/friends? Do you expect them to check in on you out of the blue? Do you expect them to always keep you in mind when talking to you about potentially triggering subjects? How/When do you educate them about these expectations?
