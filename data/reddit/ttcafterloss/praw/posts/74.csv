They just found out they’re expecting and we’re the first people they told. Intellectually, I am so happy for them. But I have been absolutely overwhelmed by feelings of sadness and anger since they told us. 

I feel like a big jerk. I have cried about it several times—they trusted me with this happy, amazing, well-deserved news and I’m handling it so poorly. Not to their faces (I’m pretty good at performing/hiding feelings), but when I’m on my own, I’m just so, deeply sad and jealous about it.

<p>Ihad two miscarriages in 2018. One at six weeks (at home) one at eleven weeks (via d and c). These were my first pregnancies. We started trying again this January. </p>

<p>Our best friends (they are like family) have been trying for over a year with absolutely no luck. It has been tough on them both (understandably), and we have all bonded through our fertility struggles. </p>

<p>They just found out they’re expecting and we’re the first people they told. Intellectually, I am so happy for them. But I have been absolutely overwhelmed by feelings of sadness and anger since they told us. </p>

<p>I feel like a big jerk. I have cried about it several times—they trusted me with this happy, amazing, well-deserved news and I’m handling it so poorly. Not to their faces (I’m pretty good at performing/hiding feelings), but when I’m on my own, I’m just so, deeply sad and jealous about it. </p>

I had the procedure done on 3/6 at 9+1 (blighted ovum). 2 weeks later the doctor calls me back in to do another ultrasound and finds remaining tissue, so I had to get a repeat D&C on 3/25, this time she prescribed mistoprostol to be inserted at the cervix a few hours before which really helped with the pain. Anyway I've been taking cheapy hpts every few days since just to track HCG levels falling and today's was very faint. I also started spotting on and off since 4/3, which I thought was my period but never got a full on AF. I decided to also take opk just to see and it was positive.

I’ve had a history of irregular cycles since I first started my period at 13. I got on birth control for the first time at 22 and was on it for a year and a half before my husband and I decided to begin TTC. I had a 48 day cycle my first cycle off birth control, and then a 90 day cycle before I went to my doctor and she prescribed me progesterone to jump start my cycle. Everything went perfectly that cycle and I conceived, but then miscarried at 7 weeks. 

My miscarriage was traumatic as I have vaginismus and am terrified to go to the Obgyn. Since then, I’ve just been focusing on recovering mentally and emotionally before TTC again and/or having to go to my OBGYN to find answers. 

After my miscarriage, I didn’t have a period for 95 days. After some research I decided to try bio-identical progesterone cream and used it to help jump start my period again, but after five days I stopped because it made me depressed. Even after only taking it five days, my cycle started. 

Here we are on CD29. I started spotting (pink and brown CM) on CD17 and it hasn’t stopped. I had one day of red blood on CD28 and thought my period started, but the brown spotting returned the next day. I have no idea what’s going on or if I ovulated. 

I know I need to see a doctor, and I’m planning to ASAP. I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar and if you discovered it was PCOS or what you & your doctors did to fix it. 

I’m kind of afraid that my miscarriage was not random but in fact a hormone issue that has yet to be resolved.

35,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi friends.  After my recent MMC journey, I realized how little information is available to those going through miscarriages, despite how sadly common it is.  I really appreciated the personal experience posts I found on this sub, so I decided to make my own in hopes that it may help someone else in my shoes.  This was a very loved and wanted baby, and the loss was devastating, but I will try to make this a more factual than emotional post.  I have taken detailed notes throughout my journey in the hopes that I may be able to help someone else.

**TIMELINE:**

On 11/7, I found out I was 3 and a half weeks pregnant.  My OB/GYN agreed to see me at about 8 weeks, so I did my best to be a good incubator for the next month.  Light exercise, healthy eating, etc.  If it was even a question, I avoided it.

On 12/5 I had my first ultrasound.  Baby measured at 6 + 0 (6 weeks 0 days).  The doctor wasn't worried and told me I likely didn't track my cycle quite right.   The FHR (fetal heart rate) was 81 BPM (beats per minute).  I knew it was low as soon as I heard it.  Again, doctor wasn't too concerned but told me to come in next week to see how things were progressing.

On 12/8, I knew something wasn't right.  I didn't feel any pain or bleeding, but on a gut level, I felt *wrong*.  I told husband I felt like I'd lost the baby.

On 12/11 I had my follow up ultrasound.  The doctor found no heartbeat, and based on development estimated the baby had passed 2 - 3 days after my first scan.  I still had *no bleeding or cramping whatsoever*, so I was diagnosed with a ""missed miscarriage.""  That is, my body was not recognizing that the child was gone so the natural miscarriage process wasn't starting.  The doctor explained that I could take a misoprostol and methergine regimen to hopefully jumpstart the process, but if the medication didn't work, I'd have to have a D & C (dilation and curettage) surgery to remove the baby and the accompanying tissue.  I opted to try medication first as it was much cheaper and less invasive.

On 12/12 I started the medication--4 misoprostol every 24 hours, repeated twice.  This had absolutely no effect.  I was told to take the methergine once the bleeding started, but it never did.

On 12/17 I went back to the doctor and was told I could try one more round of medication, or schedule a D & C.  She did a second ultrasound and informed me that the tissue hadn't moved at all and the medication did not appear to be working.  I opted for the medication again.  This time I took 3 misoprostol every 6 hours, repeated twice.  The doctor advised me to take the medication *vaginally rather than orally* for best results.  Again, no effects.

On 12/19 I had another follow up and ultrasound in which the doctor confirmed the tissue was still firmly implanted.  She told me she thought it would be best to schedule a D & C.  I expressed to her that I was scared of both the physical ramifications and the cost of surgery.  My doctor was great, listened to me, and explained that if I'd like she would prescribe one more round of medication--an extremely potent regimen that is no longer recommended in the US, but commonly used in rural Africa and endorsed by the WHO (World Health Organization) because D & C's are not a viable option there.  She explained that this treatment was common here 10 years ago, but is no longer prescribed mainly due to the unpleasant short term side effects (commonly diarrhea and stomach upset).  I asked if there were longer term side effects to consider, and she advised not likely.  I had already had pretty bad side effects from the medication, to the point where I figured ""how much more diarrhea could I possibly have?"", so I went for the medication again.

On 12/20 I started the last round of medication: 3 misoprostol every 6 hours (again, vaginally rather than orally), for 4 rounds.  I took the last round at 11 PM.  I was told bleeding would start in 3-4 hours if it was working, so when I woke up with no bleeding on 12/21, I started to come to terms with needing a D & C.  I don't know if it was the medication or my body finally kicking into gear, but at 9:30 AM I started having period-like cramps.  Nothing too bad, but not pleasant.  By 10:30 AM I was bleeding and began taking the methergine.

By 1:15 PM I was having heavy cramping, worse than any period I've had, and passing blood clots 3-4 inches big.  I do not have a high pain tolerance, but I was able to get through it ok.  It was extremely uncomfortable, but the pain wasn't ""sharp"" or anything.  I just laid in bed when I wasn't running to the bathroom.  After about an hour of very heavy bleeding (soaked through 3 Always Overnight Maxi Pads) I went down to heavy period-type bleeding.  By 3 PM I was down to normal period-level bleeding and had passed about 10 of the large blood clots, but no baby.

On 1/2 I went back to the doctor (delayed due to the Christmas/New Year holidays).  She did another ultrasound and confirmed that I had passed a good bit of the tissue.  The remaining tissue and the baby had shifted downward enough that she was able to ""scoop me out"" in her office, without anesthesia, kind of like a pap smear.  Honestly this was the worst part of the whole process.  On a pain scale I'd say it was a 6 out of 10.  The nurse held my hand, and the process took about 5 minutes.  It was rough and I wish I'd had my husband there.

My doctor told me to expect bleeding for 6 - 8 weeks.  My bleeding finally stopped on 3/2.  It felt like forever, and my best friend frequently heard me vent about the world's longest period.  Probably went through $25 in maxi pads.

On 3/28 I finally, finally got my period back.  My doctor cleared me to try again once my first cycle ended.  My cycles are always pretty long, so my first one lasting 7 days was a little shorter than normal for me.

So if you're counting, the whole process took about *115 days* from finding out about the loss to being back to square one and able to try again.  Way longer than I was expecting, but I am so glad to finally put this whole thing behind me.

**MEDICATIONS**:

*Misoprostol* \- this cleaned out my system like nothing else in my life ever has.  Please don't take this until you know you will have constant, uninterrupted bathroom access for 3-4 hours.  Warn your partner to go before you take the pills, because he's not going to like how it smells after.  My doctor told me I could take this and go to work.  Um, maybe some people can, but I don't recommend that.  I would have been so embarrassed spending so much time in the work bathroom, and I wouldn't have been able to keep myself together long enough to drive home, so very glad I didn't put myself in that terrible situation.

Also, I don't know why they didn't tell me this the first time, but take it vaginally rather than orally for best results.  So: use the bathroom.  Insert the pills.  Lie down for 30 minutes or so and watch a TV show to give your body time to absorb it.  And don't worry if you see it coming out a few hours later--it likely won't fully absorb.

*Methergine* \- holy hell.  This stuff gives you leg cramps like nobody's business.  As soon as you sit down for 15 minutes, you'll try to get up and just fall over.  It feels like your legs are buckling under you and can't support your weight.  It took me 2 days to figure this out, but if you just walk through it for like 2 minutes, your legs will return to normal (until you sit down again).  If you took some at night, be careful getting up the next morning.  I literally collapsed on the floor from the unexpected and overwhelming pain.  Other than the five minutes getting scooped out by the doctor, this was the worst.  Much harder than the actual miscarriage cramps.

**CONCLUSION**:

So, I hope this helps somebody.  All in all I am glad I decided to go with the medication rather than the surgery.  The process was painful, but coming from someone who has a very low pain tolerance, it was not nearly as awful as I feared.  If you're here and you're reading this because you're going through something similar, I'm so sorry.  I have a memorial ornament for my ultrasound photo, and am looking at a piece of birthstone jewelry to commemorate my baby's would-be July birthday.  I encourage you to be kind to yourself and remember your child in whatever way feels most appropriate.

<p>On 3/28 I finally, finally got my period back.  My doctor cleared me to try again once my first cycle ended.  My cycles are always pretty long, so my first one lasting 7 days was a little shorter than normal for me.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re counting, the whole process took about <em>115 days</em> from finding out about the loss to being back to square one and able to try again.  Way longer than I was expecting, but I am so glad to finally put this whole thing behind me.</p>

<p><strong>MEDICATIONS</strong>:</p>

<p><em>Misoprostol</em> - this cleaned out my system like nothing else in my life ever has.  Please don&#39;t take this until you know you will have constant, uninterrupted bathroom access for 3-4 hours.  Warn your partner to go before you take the pills, because he&#39;s not going to like how it smells after.  My doctor told me I could take this and go to work.  Um, maybe some people can, but I don&#39;t recommend that.  I would have been so embarrassed spending so much time in the work bathroom, and I wouldn&#39;t have been able to keep myself together long enough to drive home, so very glad I didn&#39;t put myself in that terrible situation.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t tell me this the first time, but take it vaginally rather than orally for best results.  So: use the bathroom.  Insert the pills.  Lie down for 30 minutes or so and watch a TV show to give your body time to absorb it.  And don&#39;t worry if you see it coming out a few hours later--it likely won&#39;t fully absorb.</p>

<p><em>Methergine</em> - holy hell.  This stuff gives you leg cramps like nobody&#39;s business.  As soon as you sit down for 15 minutes, you&#39;ll try to get up and just fall over.  It feels like your legs are buckling under you and can&#39;t support your weight.  It took me 2 days to figure this out, but if you just walk through it for like 2 minutes, your legs will return to normal (until you sit down again).  If you took some at night, be careful getting up the next morning.  I literally collapsed on the floor from the unexpected and overwhelming pain.  Other than the five minutes getting scooped out by the doctor, this was the worst.  Much harder than the actual miscarriage cramps.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>:</p>

<p>So, I hope this helps somebody.  All in all I am glad I decided to go with the medication rather than the surgery.  The process was painful, but coming from someone who has a very low pain tolerance, it was not nearly as awful as I feared.  If you&#39;re here and you&#39;re reading this because you&#39;re going through something similar, I&#39;m so sorry.  I have a memorial ornament for my ultrasound photo, and am looking at a piece of birthstone jewelry to commemorate my baby&#39;s would-be July birthday.  I encourage you to be kind to yourself and remember your child in whatever way feels most appropriate.  If you have any questions for me, feel free to PM or comment and I&#39;ll help as best I can.</p>

<p>How long do miscarriages usually take from start to finish if I let it happen naturally? How about if I had a D&amp;C? Do I count the first day of bleeding during the miscarriage as CD 1? I would like to start charting again but not sure where to start. </p>

81,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"My husband (then boyfriend) and I had been together a bit over a year officially, but had a 5 year complicated friendship/relationship before that when we decided to TTC. We went on vacation and took the time alone to talk about our goals in life and what we wanted with each other. We decided we want to be married, get a place of our own, and most strongly we wanted a baby. I never wanted babies before him. I was as childfree as they could be. Then in a weird twist of life my goddaughter ended up staying with me which put me in a role I never expected to love. I changed a lot for her - I changed my career to early education so I would be able to take her to work will me until she was old enough for elementary school. I went from a lazy hoarder to a super organized person who wasn't all about material items because now I shared my room with her. I did all the things I said I never would - diapers, dealing with tantrums, potty training, losing sleep, spending my money primarily on her instead of myself. She was more than enough to me. She was my exception and my perfect way of having a child. Then I met him, and I knew I wanted his children.

So back in November on our vacation we decided we weren't going to keep waiting for what we wanted. I'm 30 and he is 34 so we felt we had spent enough of our life waiting. We decided to work on the finding a place and planning a wedding once we got back but we would start TTC right away. I knew friends who had difficulty TTC and I knew that fertility doctors won't see you right away so we decided to get a head start incase it was a long process or we needed medical intervention. Well much to our surprise I was pregnant by December. I had gotten negatives on my Amazon test strips but had a gut feeling and bought a First Response test on the way home from work. There I saw in the Starbucks bathroom I had been getting my coffee at since I was in middle school, mentally prepared myself for a positive, telling myself one day I would see a line. And there it was. It was faint but undeniable. My husband didn't believe it was actually a positive until he compared it to a blank test. Over the next couple days I finally got a positive on the strip tests and watched the line get darker and darker as my heart grew fuller and fuller.

We had found an apartment we liked and submitted paperwork, we found out we got the place the day after I got a positive test. It felt perfect and I couldn't believe everything was falling into place. Christmas Eve he bought me my ring and we told our families we were going to get married and were moving out. Originally we were going to plan a wedding for a little longer out. But he and I had both been doing keto and I was the happiest with my weight and self image I had been in years. I told him I knew it was vain but I wanted to look this way in my wedding photos, I wanted to enjoy being the beautiful bride I had always imagined. So we planned a beach wedding for January and by some stroke of luck I found the exact wedding dress I wanted on FB marketplace used for $60 and it happened to be in the neighborhood right below mine. Again - everything felt perfect. The dress was slightly dirty on the bottom but it didn't matter because I'm so short that part was getting hemmed anyway. It fit perfectly and I couldn't believe my luck.

A week before the wedding we went for an 8 week scan. I remember the night before I cried because I was so worried about going and hearing the baby hadn't developed right. I had very little symptoms besides bigger breasts, dry skin, and being slightly more hungry. I knew this wasn't a guarantee something was wrong but it made it easier to worry. When we went for the actual scan the tech was cheerful before the scan but became very quiet and serious during. I already knew. She tried to say it was possible I was earlier than I though because I looked more like 6 weeks. I tried to swallow this news optimistically but I think my heart already knew. Two weeks behind meant I ovulated around the same day I got my positive, which I knew wasn't possible. They asked us to come back in 2 weeks for another look.

I tried to just focus on my wedding and enjoy it, but my heart was elsewhere. I didn't know if my baby was ok. I didn't know if I was carrying my dead child inside of me. I had been so excited to one day show our child our wedding pictures and point to my stomach, telling them they were there the day we became a family. And there was a strong guilt about the wedding now. His family had wanted us to wait and do something bigger and I had refused. My family had changed vacation dates and flights to be there. Was there really a reason to rush now? I didn't know.

Those two weeks were the longest of my life. At one of my lowest points a week in I considered lying and going to ER and saying I was bleeding to try to get another image. I didn't do it, but I was ready to more than once. I read every post on the internet I could about similar situations - mentally blocking out the 90% who lost their baby and clinging to the 10% whose baby just grew slow but then had a spurt and caught up. My husband grew frustrated because he didn't know how to help me and I couldn't focus on anything else. He admitted that as much as he wanted a baby, he hadn't bonded with it nearly as much as I had. At first I was so angry at him for this. Now with a little more time I realized the baby was inside me and he never even saw a picture that resembled a baby or saw my stomach grow or felt a kick - how could I have expected that same bond. I obsessively tried to spot new symptoms and even felt my cervix multiple times to feel if it was opening. I had started spotting here and there but convinced myself that was just from sex and it happened to plenty of women.

After desperately wanting those two weeks to be over I wasn't ready when the day came. Those two weeks had been full of anticipation and anxiety but also hope. As we drove to our appointment it dawned on me that these could be the last minutes of feeling like I actually had a baby in me. I almost couldn't walk in because I knew once I laid on that table, that would end. I would have answers and that pain that was hanging over my head would come crashing down and swallow me. And it did. Once again the tech was quiet and serious. Once again they had to switch from abdominal to transvaginal - at that point I knew it was done. There was slightly growth but no fetal pole, no heartbeat, and the sac had an abnormal shape. They referred me to another facility with better equipment to have another look and that felt cruel. More anticipation, more anxiety, so much less hope.

In that week I felt a lot of conflicting emotions. I mourned this baby and didn't want to let it go, but I was also so angry at my body for continuing to hold onto it. Time we could have been trying to create another healthy baby was spent carrying a baby that was not growing. I considered just making an appointment for a D/C even though I wanted to avoid that. I just wanted it all over with but at the same time I didn't want to let this one go. I was mad at myself - maybe the stress of a move and a wedding was too much to expect my body to handle with making a human. Maybe I shouldn't have had wine during the two week wait. Maybe that ride at Disneyland I rode ruined my baby. As much as I didn't want it to be my fault, I wanted a reason. Being able to blame myself would have been better than not knowing why.

A week later we went in to the new facility for another scan. Sitting in the waiting room surrounded by pictures of babies was rough. The cheerfulness of everybody was rough. They asked us how far along we were and I had to tell them we weren't sure anymore. They had to take my blood pressure multiple times because it was sky high from nerves. The only comfort this time is that is was absolute. There was even less on the scan this time - just an empty sac. They told me my body was absorbing it and even though my urine test was positive, I wasn't pregnant. They wanted to do blood work which seemed pointless at this point but I agreed. The lady who took my blood asked how far along we were which was like a punch to the gut. Then another lady came in after to bandage my arm and asked if we knew what we were having - gut punch number two.

The next day, the day before Valentines Day, my body finally released it. My husband still says he thinks the timing is a crazy coincidence, as if my mind really needed validation it was hopeless before my mind could let go. The process was painful but nowhere near as bad as I expected. The feeling of the larger clots coming out was really uncomfortable and unnerving. I spent most of the first day in the shower because it was relaxing and just easier than having a mess.

There is so much about the experience I resent. I resent that if we conceive again I will never be able to be excited about an ultrasound, just anxious and scared. I am not even sure I will be able to enjoy getting a positive test like I did with this one. Valentine's Day will always be associated with losing our baby for me. My husband's birthday was our due date, and that will always be harder to celebrate now.

Our relationship has a lot of tension now too. Before my husband would watch his two nephews, 5 and 10 months, every Monday. He didn't understand why it was too hard on me to have baby things in my house and a baby who looked like my husband being cuddled by my husband. He tried but he does not completely understand the amazing hole this has left in me. I see babies or pregnancy announcements and feel sick and want to cry. He says I have become bitter and that is selfish - maybe it is, but I'm just trying to protect myself so I can heal. I need distance from that stuff. One of our good friends announced a couple weeks after our loss and I'm dreading the next time I see her because I don't know how to handle it. We're constantly talking through it and have brought up counseling.

For now, we are trying again. I saw so many people say you're super fertile after a miscarriage and was so disappointed when a month later, I got my period. No super fertile time post-miscarriage baby for me. Our chance for a baby this year is gone. I told my husband last year this was our last Christmas without a baby, and now that isn't true. The fact that it isn't even a possibility until 2020 just feels overwhelmingly unfair. I haven't been okay since and I don't know when I will be. I go to work, I see friends, I work on our house, but normal for me seems to be anger and sadness now. I wear a ring with an August birthstone for my should have been August baby. I shared the ultrasound pictures we did have with everybody and told everyone about our baby, because our baby was loved and doesn't deserve to be forgotten. I know some people will say it wasn't even a baby yet but it was everything to us. My life changed the minute I saw that line, my hopes and dreams and fears and image of the future were immediately rewritten. How many weeks we lost our baby at doesn't just erase that. ",[],False,,0,False,"Intro - Early loss back in February, TTC again but still struggling emotionally",[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_b9iiq1,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},Intro,False,7,,self,False,,{},,True,,1554441428.0,text,0,,,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>My husband (then boyfriend) and I had been together a bit over a year officially, but had a 5 year complicated friendship/relationship before that when we decided to TTC. We went on vacation and took the time alone to talk about our goals in life and what we wanted with each other. We decided we want to be married, get a place of our own, and most strongly we wanted a baby. I never wanted babies before him. I was as childfree as they could be. Then in a weird twist of life my goddaughter ended up staying with me which put me in a role I never expected to love. I changed a lot for her - I changed my career to early education so I would be able to take her to work will me until she was old enough for elementary school. I went from a lazy hoarder to a super organized person who wasn&#39;t all about material items because now I shared my room with her. I did all the things I said I never would - diapers, dealing with tantrums, potty training, losing sleep, spending my money primarily on her instead of myself. She was more than enough to me. She was my exception and my perfect way of having a child. Then I met him, and I knew I wanted his children.</p>

<p>So back in November on our vacation we decided we weren&#39;t going to keep waiting for what we wanted. I&#39;m 30 and he is 34 so we felt we had spent enough of our life waiting. We decided to work on the finding a place and planning a wedding once we got back but we would start TTC right away. I knew friends who had difficulty TTC and I knew that fertility doctors won&#39;t see you right away so we decided to get a head start incase it was a long process or we needed medical intervention. Well much to our surprise I was pregnant by December. I had gotten negatives on my Amazon test strips but had a gut feeling and bought a First Response test on the way home from work. There I saw in the Starbucks bathroom I had been getting my coffee at since I was in middle school, mentally prepared myself for a positive, telling myself one day I would see a line. And there it was. It was faint but undeniable. My husband didn&#39;t believe it was actually a positive until he compared it to a blank test. Over the next couple days I finally got a positive on the strip tests and watched the line get darker and darker as my heart grew fuller and fuller.</p>

<p>We had found an apartment we liked and submitted paperwork, we found out we got the place the day after I got a positive test. It felt perfect and I couldn&#39;t believe everything was falling into place. Christmas Eve he bought me my ring and we told our families we were going to get married and were moving out. Originally we were going to plan a wedding for a little longer out. But he and I had both been doing keto and I was the happiest with my weight and self image I had been in years. I told him I knew it was vain but I wanted to look this way in my wedding photos, I wanted to enjoy being the beautiful bride I had always imagined. So we planned a beach wedding for January and by some stroke of luck I found the exact wedding dress I wanted on FB marketplace used for $60 and it happened to be in the neighborhood right below mine. Again - everything felt perfect. The dress was slightly dirty on the bottom but it didn&#39;t matter because I&#39;m so short that part was getting hemmed anyway. It fit perfectly and I couldn&#39;t believe my luck.</p>

<p>A week before the wedding we went for an 8 week scan. I remember the night before I cried because I was so worried about going and hearing the baby hadn&#39;t developed right. I had very little symptoms besides bigger breasts, dry skin, and being slightly more hungry. I knew this wasn&#39;t a guarantee something was wrong but it made it easier to worry. When we went for the actual scan the tech was cheerful before the scan but became very quiet and serious during. I already knew. She tried to say it was possible I was earlier than I though because I looked more like 6 weeks. I tried to swallow this news optimistically but I think my heart already knew. Two weeks behind meant I ovulated around the same day I got my positive, which I knew wasn&#39;t possible. They asked us to come back in 2 weeks for another look.</p>

<p>I tried to just focus on my wedding and enjoy it, but my heart was elsewhere. I didn&#39;t know if my baby was ok. I didn&#39;t know if I was carrying my dead child inside of me. I had been so excited to one day show our child our wedding pictures and point to my stomach, telling them they were there the day we became a family. And there was a strong guilt about the wedding now. His family had wanted us to wait and do something bigger and I had refused. My family had changed vacation dates and flights to be there. Was there really a reason to rush now? I didn&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Those two weeks were the longest of my life. At one of my lowest points a week in I considered lying and going to ER and saying I was bleeding to try to get another image. I didn&#39;t do it, but I was ready to more than once. I read every post on the internet I could about similar situations - mentally blocking out the 90% who lost their baby and clinging to the 10% whose baby just grew slow but then had a spurt and caught up. My husband grew frustrated because he didn&#39;t know how to help me and I couldn&#39;t focus on anything else. He admitted that as much as he wanted a baby, he hadn&#39;t bonded with it nearly as much as I had. At first I was so angry at him for this. Now with a little more time I realized the baby was inside me and he never even saw a picture that resembled a baby or saw my stomach grow or felt a kick - how could I have expected that same bond. I obsessively tried to spot new symptoms and even felt my cervix multiple times to feel if it was opening. I had started spotting here and there but convinced myself that was just from sex and it happened to plenty of women.</p>

<p>After desperately wanting those two weeks to be over I wasn&#39;t ready when the day came. Those two weeks had been full of anticipation and anxiety but also hope. As we drove to our appointment it dawned on me that these could be the last minutes of feeling like I actually had a baby in me. I almost couldn&#39;t walk in because I knew once I laid on that table, that would end. I would have answers and that pain that was hanging over my head would come crashing down and swallow me. And it did. Once again the tech was quiet and serious. Once again they had to switch from abdominal to transvaginal - at that point I knew it was done. There was slightly growth but no fetal pole, no heartbeat, and the sac had an abnormal shape. They referred me to another facility with better equipment to have another look and that felt cruel. More anticipation, more anxiety, so much less hope.</p>

I was looking for tickets for Avengers, and that was my whole day yesterday. I was excited and lost on that excitement, but then I remember that last year by this time, I found out I was pregnant, and that exactly around the same movie, I had my first pic where I started wondering if I’ll have finally what I have wished more than anything for a long time. After that came the memories of everything, the smells, the food, the pictures, the family, the love and later the sadness, angry and loneliness I felt.

I realize I think about it in a different way. I still feel sad, mad, empty, but I’m also resigned by now, that I couldn’t do anything. That it happened already, the things I did and didn’t do, the pain, the other ones having their healthy pregnancies when they don’t even want them.

I was looking for tickets for Avengers, and that was my whole day yesterday.

My OB is good, and even though it’s early, I need him highly invested in me. If he’s not, I’m going to find someone who is. 

A little history — I had my first OB who diagnosed me with a bicornuate uterus while I was about 8weeks pregnant. We were concerned but she said she most that would happen is I’ll have a c section. I read online a lot but it’s so black and white with that type of uterus. My new OB was surprised I had even been able to get pregnant. So I have two very different opinions. Either there are infertile issues or miscarriages. I had NO issue becoming pregnant and no miscarriage. But my water broke at 21 weeks, so there was preterm labor. I had bleeding and a visible pocket of blood near the placenta but my original OB said she thinks the placenta attached to an artery that’s bleeding out. 

I delivered my son on Friday and lost him but my OB said something about a blood clot near the placenta. I’ll be seeing him this Saturday and flood him with questions. My placenta went to pathology too. Hopefully I find out more info. 

Anyway — my main question is...I have a year to ttc again. I don’t want the same things to happen if I can help it.

I requested a HCG for my peace of mind. My betas on Monday was only 6, but my FRERs yesterday were considerably darker so I clung on to the little bit of hope I had left in me that I somehow miscalculated dates or something, and of course darker lines mean more HCG so they have definitely risen in the 24 hours since. I spoke to the doctors, they were going to retest my blood Monday because of the stronger HPT lines.

Now my lines are fading, and the bleed has begun. I don't know why this is happening. I've tried to get hold of my GP but they are shut for training. So I'll have to wait until tomorrow.

I don't feel like I felt last time, I don't feel crushed. I feel numb. Even though this time was different, I've had no pain leading up to it, I just knew what the outcome would be. I put it down to anxiety after last time but clearly not.

I was diagnosed with a blighted ovum at 10 weeks. Up until then, I was one of **3** pregnant women in my small office. There are about 15 people in my office, and 2 men. So, not a very large pool.

I haven't been too triggered by my pregnant coworkers, I think because they are so much further along than I was, and because I was already used to them being pregnant. One of them is also my best friend, and I love her and her baby dearly.

I took Cytotec March 21st, and had a followup ultrasound last Thursday, which I'm still waiting to hear back from the doctor about. I finally stopped bleeding 2 days ago, and am really just trying to feel normal, again.

I was already having an ""off"" day, today, feeling more depressed than usual, when I heard other coworkers talking about how ""R"" wasn't in because of morning sickness. This is the first I've heard about this. I guess it was an announcement, of sorts(?). This was right before lunch, so my friend and I ducked out and she commiserated with me.

I like R--she's very sweet and I get along well with her--I just can't help but remember that that was *me* such a short time ago. *I* was the third pregnant woman in the office. *I* was feeling over the moon with excitement. I was beginning to accept my situation, but now watching her pregnancy that is so close to mine I'll be constantly comparing it to how she is what I'm supposed to be.

I came back from lunch, and R had recovered enough to come into work. I heard another coworker congratulating her and giggling, and I lost it and started crying. I also heard her mention it was unplanned, which hurt to hear, even though she seems happy and I'm glad for her.  My boss was right by me when it happened and told me I could leave if I needed to, so I left. I know they'll all probably guess why I left (I work in the medical field and my coworkers knew about my pregnancy to help me avoid harmful situations, and consequently know about my miscarriage), but I just didn't have it in me to see R and confront my feelings. I also didn't want to pull her down when she is probably feeling so excited.

I had a miscarriage almost a year ago (April 20th). Yes, it was fairly early (7 weeks). But in that time frame...that was a baby to me and my fiancé. We’d talk to him. (We think he was a boy, anyway). We’d sing to him. I was prepared to rearrange my entire life for him. And it was completely fucking devastating when I lost him. My fiancé and I named him later on. His name was Connor, he was due around December 11th, and his life meant something to me.

In the aftermath of the miscarriage, my mom and I didn’t talk for 7 months. She was extremely insensitive when I broke the news to her (after she repeatedly asked if I was pregnant in an extremely negative tone). We’re talking again and have a decent-ish relationship, but a leopard doesn’t change its spots I guess.

I was talking to her yesterday and I brought up how the rest of the family totally ignored me after I had the miscarriage, even after I went totally public about it (I wrote an essay for a popular website l). I then brought up how she doesn’t even acknowledge the baby. Like she’s never used the word baby.

She basically said she was gonna explain herself, but I wouldn’t like it, and that I “wasn’t allowed” to get mad at her. So I told her to say it.

She basically said she was uncomfortable referring to it as a baby because it was early on and that’s not how she thinks. That she’s uncomfortable saying that. That she “doesn’t have to agree with me” or see things the same way. I then told her it costs her nothing to follow my lead and be compassionate. She then said “I’m sorry you lost your baby.” In a tone that honestly sounded kind of insincere.

I tried to tell her that, for example, it meant a lot to me when a friend mentioned “when you have your first living child” because she was acknowledging him. She just said that it wasn’t in her to say that, basically.

I mentioned that my partner and I gave him a name. She said that was sweet (or something along those lines) but didn’t even think to ask what his name is.

She also said she refuses to read the article I wrote because she “doesn’t want to find out personal things about me through the internet”.

I did point out that she had a friend who had a miscarriage years ago and was more sympathetic (it was actually a stillbirth but it was so long ago I didn’t know that.) She basically said “That was DIFFERENT. J**** gave birth. She held her babies. They looked like babies. She had to bury them in a cemetery.” And on one hand, I get it. Yes, perspective is important and that would probably be worse. But on the other hand, no, I never so much as had cramps or bled, I just carried a dead baby for two and a half weeks knowing I could basically start bleeding out at any given moment. I then had to have surgery under general anaesthetic which scares the crap out of me. That’s why I never saw him. So much better, right? And she’s right, he didn’t look like a baby when they did the ultrasound or the D+C. That’s because he probably had a massive genetic defect! Neither of those things is my fault and she made me feel like a piece of shit because my body couldn’t produce a properly formed baby and then when he died, held on to him for another two and a half weeks.

I had a huge breakdown in November, I really wanted to get a BFP by the time the original due date was (December 20), and I had a feeling it just wasn't going to happen. It didnt. It still hasn't.

But, this time last year, I didn't know it, but I was pregnant. I wouldn't take a test until April 16, 18DPO, because I was loosely tracking and didnt notice. We found out in May that I had a blight ovum and was MC'ing.

I feel like we'll never have that moment again. I have undergone blood work, ultrasounds, tests, homeopathic appointments to appease my ""naturopath"" MIL.... nothing. I have light periods and only a ""medium"" flow for 1 day, then a light for 1 day, then spotting for a couple days, but the ultrasound showed a fine uterine lining (it was 2 DPO). But, I cannot figure out how to ""fix"" my light periods. Otherwise, I am healthy. We ordered an at home sperm test and got the low range of normal, but I cant control my husband. He is a little overweight, he owns a restaurant and is a chef there, so he's always hot, and hes working 5-6 days a week 8-14 hour days.

Nothing on his end will change. He used to smoke weed, and has decreased, but hasn't quit. He ""doesnt have time"" to work out, and he never gets enough sleep. So, I feel like why bother?

Since my November meltdown, I had positive mantras, I stepped back from tracking, I stepped back from social media, but this month, I just crumbled. I had a wonderful chart, I got hopeful, and I was crushed... again. I know it takes the toll on my husband as well, but he only has the instant shock of, oh got my period. Not the build up and let down every single month. The positive mantras clearly havent helped. I cant help but feel like I will never be a mother, and honestly, what's the point then? I work 6 days a week, 5 days at my job that I drive an hour to every day just to pay my 1300$/month in student loans, and then one day waitressing at his restaurant... for what? I am alone every night but one night a week, I hardly have any friends here, because I moved to his home town and he bought the rest shortly after I moved here, so I never really ""got in"" with his friends, and I am shy, so I dont really meet people that easily. The 2 friends I do have own their own business' and are just as busy as my husband.

I just feel so down. I dont know why I am wasting my life, if I'll never be a mother, what's the point? I have done everything in my power so far, my midwife does not think its me and while she said I can do an HSG and further, she thinks it is just a matter of time. I went off BC christmas 2016, it took months for my period to regulate (like 8 months), and 14 months to get pregnant. after the MC, it was months again for my period to regulate, and here we are, 10 months later, and again, nothing. We wanted 2-3 kids, and here I am, over 2 years off BC, turning 32 in May, and childless.

I cant even go on facebook, instagram, snapchat, because as happy as I am for my friends with kids, my eyes well up every time they send me videos... because it seems that will never be me.

&#x200B;

This got long, I am sorry. I feel like my husband is scared every time I am sad, so I stopped talking to him about it, because I know he is sad as well. He would be literally the best father, hes the best uncle and god father... and I probably will never allow him to be a father. I am contemplating going to therapy, but my family was always really hush hush about every thing, and even though depression runs in my family, therapy seems to be taboo and I was never raised with it being acceptable. i dont even know where to start.

&#x200B;

I know if you're on this sub, you have your own problems, and I really do try and be positive for people, but even the facebook groups I am part of, every time I see a BFP, I am happy for them, but so angry at the same time.

So I recently joined this thread after finding out I had a missed miscarriage. Finally naturally miscarried one week ago today. I joined this thread without knowing if I was ever going to try again.

One of the most hurtful things people asked me as soon as I told them we had miscarried was ""are you going to try again?"". It was like this baby didn't even matter or exist. I would always politely say we haven't discussed it yet. Or that we weren't ready to make that decision just yet. 

My husband and I had not been planning on having children of our own. He has 3 from a previous marriage and we were content with our little family as it was. So when we found out we were pregnant we were shocked and for a time very unsure of how we felt. Then the miscarriage happened. We have talked about maybe just returning back to our old plan of no children for us. Grieve this child and heal, but focus our energy elsewhere. 

Well last night at a George Strait concert he begins to sing I Saw God Today. The song is about a man becoming a father. Before I knew it we were both in tears. We immediately knew how much our hearts hurt and yearned for a child. When we got home from the concert we finally had our first real conversation about how we felt and what we wanted. We will still probably wait at least 6 months before we try again. Because we realize we still need to grieve for our baby. Also, having had weightloss surgery less than a year ago I don't believe my body is ready to support a healthy pregnancy just yet. But at least now we have had a real conversation about how we feel and now we know we what to try again.

&#x200B;

DH and I have been together for 7 years, we have nearly 3 year old rainbow twins, and we're currently trying for #3. I became pregnant in December 2018 but miscarried the week after Christmas, and I had what I believe to be a chemical pregnancy in January.

&#x200B;

February we had absolutely no chance of conceiving so that didn't bother me as much, but this month DH has done so much overtime (he works evenings and nights) that we did manage to do the deed around ovulation, and I am now two days late.

&#x200B;

I've done a variety of different tests and I can see the faintest of pink lines on them. I did a Tesco test (blue ink) and thought I could see a line during the 10 minute window. When I went back to it a few hours later there was a very blue line. Did a FRER today around lunch time and again, I could see a faint pink line, but it was vvvv faint.

&#x200B;

I've just started brown spotting slightly, and (TMI) my cervix is very high up to the point I can barely reach it. I don't know what any of this means. Am I pregnant? Am I having a chemical pregnancy? Are all of those tests just evaporation lines? DH doesn't understand the concept of a chemical pregnancy. He would just say ""oh your period has arrived"" and that's that. He hasn't seen half the tests I have taken as like the last CP he couldn't see any lines and thought I was being crazy. I feel so alone in this.

&#x200B;

I just can't keep going with the heartbreak of another loss, or another month of not getting pregnant. My twins have their birthday in a couple of weeks and everyone keeps talking about when I was pregnant and how hard it was, and I can't think about it.

Long story short, I had a very abnormal 12 week scan and no heartbeat on the follow up 1 week later. They scheduled a D&C in September and things seemed to be fine initially (about 4 days of moderate bleeding, minimal cramping). We decided to wait until at least 1-2 periods to TTC since previously I have had a regular 35 day cycle, but each cycle since D&C have been 90 days, so 2 cycles so far. I would go to my OB after 10-12 weeks of no bleeding and negative preg tests and he suggested progesterone twice but magically I would have my period the week after without taking anything. 

After 1st period I started using OPKs and they were all over the place. High for 10 days then low for a couple so I would stop testing and when I had a negative preg test I did the OPK again and it would fluctuate high again. I did notice a darker ""peak"" level one day at CD 75 but had another peak a week later, finally had my period on day 92. OB said my hormones need more time to regulate so I'm on CD 35 and still having fluctuating/low OPKs. I started BBT this month but that is unreliable since I work night shifts. Also just started on synthroid for hypothyroid that was just diagnosed 1 month ago, OB said likely pregnancy related and I may not need meds in 6 months to a year.
Also should mention that I used to have a lot of noticeable CM during cycles and sore boobs around ovulation pre-pregnancy and now I have no symptoms the past 6 months.

Any suggestions? I'm kind of just accepting the possibility that my cycles are now 90 days long but I'm afraid of missing a peak OPK or that I may not be ovulating. OB says if I'm having periods I should be ovulating but I'm not used to such long cycles and lack of my typical ovulation signs. I know everyone says to stop stressing out but I felt so in tune with my body before and now everything feels so out of whack. March 15th was my original due date so I'm sure a lot of the anxiety I've been feeling recently is because of that, but it's gotten to the point of losing sleep and crying in the car randomly.

Any advice/info would be massively appreciated. 

Bleeding started on the 4th just before what would have been my 12 week scan. We had our scan anyway and found out that our little one had been gone since 8 weeks (this is the 2nd 8 week loss we have experienced) bleeding got heavier and the pregnancy was no longer a part of me by nightfall on the 5th March. From that I had the usual bleeding of MC. 
I was sure everything had gone but today I've done a digital test (as the hospital advised) and it says pregnant 1-2 weeks! 
I will admit we dtd without protection exactly 1 week ago but since the bleeding/spotting had only just stopped I didn't think anything could happen. Also I didn't think pregnant tests were THAT exact? 

I'm terrified of either option becoming a reality. I've cancelled my university plans for today and I've called my boss to cancel tomorrow's shift as the hospital want to see me. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Does anyone know the chances of this being a new baby? 
I feel so stupid for letting this happen!

The thing I want most right now is a baby. And the moment that I get pregnant, I will not think twice up about these things I'm about to complain about. 

I've been on this journey for a year and a half now. And I'm sick of always thinking but what if I'm pregnant by then? Here is a list of my things: 

1. Avoiding sushi dates during the TWW. It is what it is, but sometimes I want sushi and decide to pass just in case. 

2. Trips and Vacations. Anytime we plan a trip, visiting family or a weekend getaway I wonder can I participate in activities we've planned if I'm pregnant? So we shouldn't plan to go ziplining Hawaii?

3. Doing something about my acne. This one is frustrating. Over the last year my skin has really gotten out of control but so much of the acne medication/regimens are not pregnancy friendly. So I'm not pregnant but still can't really do anything because who knows I might be. 

4. Drinking juice and caffiene intake. I make juice at home, not for some crazy diet or fad, I genuinely like the taste of fresh juice. Fun fact though, can't have unpasteurized juices if I'm pregnant. I also drink coffee  which is still below the allowed amount for pregnancy,  but no really, should I be drinking this right now? 

5. Buying furtniture. I literally won't buy things for my house because when I have a baby I'll need the space for the babys things. Why buy shelves when that's the perfect spot for my baby's changing table?

6. Getting a new job. Anytime I've wanted to get a new job, I've convinced myself it's not the right time because I'm comfortable and they trust me so I don't have to worry about ""proving myself"" at a new company. 

7. Really expensive gym membership. I cancelled my really expensive gym membership because every month during the TWW I started taking it easy just in case I was pregnant. 

So here I am a year later, missing out on sushi, worrying about upcoming trips, with frustrating breakouts, drinking questionable juices and caffeine, with random empty spaces in the house, at the same job, getting out of shape, all without a baby to bring home with me.

Do I sounds crazy or what? What kinds of things do you put on hold during this process?

So, I have had blood work, post ovulation ultrasounds, blah blah blah, and everything has come back good. I decided, before doing anything more invasive (hsg, etc), I was putting everything on hold until DH did a SA.

My midwife told me about the YO at home semen analysis, approved by the FDA, so he bought one!

We did it Sunday, and it was super cool to watch those swimmers on the screen, and he came back ""Normal/Moderate""... but then I did some looking around the app, and saw there is a range of 10-90+ in the normal range... and he got a 10. Most men average 40-60. So he is literally bottom of the barrel getting by. He smokes weed occasionally, and has cut back only recently, he wants to loose weight as he has gained weight with a schedule change and job change, and hasnt set aside time to work out, and he actually did start last night. He takes ubiquinol and krill oil, and a multivitamin for preconception from one a day... but, now I dont know where to go.

TW: We got pregnant by accident this time last year, and had a blight ovum miscarriage in May at just shy of 8 weeks. It sucked, obviously. Now, its about a year later, and nothing... and I had been off BC a year before we got pregnant anyway, and he had stopped smoking 6 months prior to becoming pregnant. So, of course, I blame the weed! haha.

Yesterday, I started feeling like my uterus was heavy. Idk how else to describe it. As the day went on, it became really tender and sore. Generally achy. Achy enough that I had a difficult time falling asleep last night. This morning it wasn’t any better. I called my on-call Obgyn and after some discussion she insisted I go to the ER. Of course the concern was retained tissue or an ectopic that hadn’t dissolved with the miscarriage (as my hcg is 0). 

So anyway, after a pelvic exam, bloods, and ultrasound, they can’t find anything wrong. They literally said everything looked perfect on the ultrasound. They did see that my cervix is irritated which was noted during the pelvic exam. They sent me home and basically told me they have no idea why I’m in pain. 

I will have the information sent to my OB tomorrow and we will discuss later this week. I’m just alarmed with the type of pain that nothing is showing up as a red flag. 

Also: neg for UTI, White blood cells are normal, no unusual discharge and none found during exam. So doesn’t seem to be BV or yeast related. And I wasn’t far along, about 5weeks, 6 at most. 

So it leaves me wondering if this is normal to experience after a natural mc? Can anyone else relate?
