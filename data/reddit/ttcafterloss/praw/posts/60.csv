Husband is 35.  Our only diagnosis so far is MFI.  We did a round of ICSI where we had to freeze all.  Wound up with 5 blasts from 27 eggs.  Lost 1 in thaw, transferred 2 as single embryo transfers, both with a medicated FET protocol.  Neither showed any sign of implantation.  I had never had a positive test in my life.  We naively thought that if we could just finally have implantation... we'd be set.  For out final FET just a few weeks ago, we decided to put in our last 2 embryos.  I also did a natural protocol with follistim, ganirelix, trigger and PIO.  We were SHOCKED and so elated when I got my first ever positive HPT.  I had some light brown spotting that went away quickly.  But... my tests barely seemed to get any darker.  I went in at 10dp5dt and my HCG was 38.  Not good, but still hope.  3 days later on 13dp5dt, it had gone down to 31.7.  I couldn't believe it.  My line looked darker, all spotting had stopped, I really thought this was going to be it.  I'm having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that our first pregnancy is a CP or very early miscarriage.  We feel beyond devastated and defeated.  The thought of going through another retrieval and everything that comes with it, is soul crushing.  I'm not sure what to say to people even though we are open about our struggle.  I was able to tell my husband about our very first pregnancy, on Father's Day.  It felt like a dream.  We were cautiously optimistic but let our dreams and thoughts run away with us as we gleefully planned our impending journey into parenthood.  We were so blissfully naive. Ugh.

Planning on having more testing done.  NK test, autoimmune testing, hysteroscopy.  We also are tentatively planning to do a fresh transfer (if I can use ganirelix to prevent it from being canceled like last time) and then sending off any blasts that make freeze, to be PGS tested.  Any other ideas/opinions are welcomed.

We had a molar pregnancy with a coexisting healthy pregnancy (Mabel), which is apparently very rare .001% chance of happening.

The doctors recommend waiting 6 months - but we are going in for an appointment in July to see about getting pregnant earlier.

My story: Went off HBC 15 months ago to TTC, discovered wildly irregular menstrual cycles, started going to an RE, got diagnosed with PCOS, got pregnant last month, on our first round of Letrozole, Ovidrel, and timed intercourse.

At 14dpo, my HCG was 24. At 18dpo, it was 85. At 22dpo (yesterday), it went down to 45. So even though the nurse had a very cheerful voice, she very blatantly asked ""So this is a chemical pregnancy. Are you bleeding yet?""

Fuck, lady. Have some heart. I have come to know her as one of the not-so-nice nurses at my clinic.

So I guess I'm just waiting to start bleeding, and hoping I won't have to wait to start again. I get different answers depending on which nurse I talk to. The nice nurse said we'd probably start right away. I like the nice nurse.

I kept bursting out crying yesterday. I am constantly Googling to see if there's a chance this pregnancy is still viable. And to try to figure out what to expect. I know we triggered before my lining was as thick as they wanted, but the nurse assured me that's not why I'm losing it. But I don't know if I believe her.

We had our 2nd follow-up with our MFM specialist this morning (Sunday will be 2 months since we lost our son for unknown reasons). I was pretty upset after the first appointment because we were given a 6 month waiting period on ttc again, and while I was on the fence about being ready, it was at least something to look forward to. I got my first period a couple weeks later, and I was so incredibly down because it all felt pointless.

At our appointment this morning, she said that all my labs looked really great except for my vitamin D (not shocking since  I'm really fair and avoid the sun), which she gave me a prescription for. I brought up the timeline on waiting again, and she said given that everything has been coming back fine, we could start at 3 months. It's amazing how much of a boost that gave me. As I'm sure many of you have felt, there are a lot of conflicting emotions as I know I'll never replace Jeremiah nor would I ever want to, but I've wanted a child for a long time. Having that window open a little earlier makes me feel more hopeful.

She also referred me to a therapist and gave me a prescription for Xanax. When I'm in my daily routine, I'm okay. Not great...but okay. Work distracts me and home is my safe place. However, when I'm doing something outside of that, I get extremely anxious and either shut down or panic (this weekend, I somehow managed to do both). It's like I forget how to be a person, which freaks out the people around me. I swear my mom has called 3 times a day every day since she saw me last. I'm leery about taking xanax, but I think it'll be good to have something if I really truly need it. Therapy has always been helpful to me, so I think that'll be a positive, if painful, thing too.

<p>At our appointment this morning, she said that all my labs looked really great except for my vitamin D (not shocking since  I&#39;m really fair and avoid the sun), which she gave me a prescription for. I brought up the timeline on waiting again, and she said given that everything has been coming back fine, we could start at 3 months. It&#39;s amazing how much of a boost that gave me. As I&#39;m sure many of you have felt, there are a lot of conflicting emotions as I know I&#39;ll never replace Jeremiah nor would I ever want to, but I&#39;ve wanted a child for a long time. Having that window open a little earlier makes me feel more hopeful.</p>

<p>She also referred me to a therapist and gave me a prescription for Xanax. When I&#39;m in my daily routine, I&#39;m okay. Not great...but okay. Work distracts me and home is my safe place. However, when I&#39;m doing something outside of that, I get extremely anxious and either shut down or panic (this weekend, I somehow managed to do both). It&#39;s like I forget how to be a person, which freaks out the people around me. I swear my mom has called 3 times a day every day since she saw me last. I&#39;m leery about taking xanax, but I think it&#39;ll be good to have something if I really truly need it. Therapy has always been helpful to me, so I think that&#39;ll be a positive, if painful, thing too.</p>

<p>Very grateful for this community and hope everyone is taking care of themselves!</p>

Wondering if anyone who has had HELLP syndrome had a ""normal"" pregnancy after. I am by no means ready physically, mentally or emotionally ready to start down that road but I'm just curious if it's even an option.

Background:
This was our second pregnancy. Our first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage at 10 weeks requiring a D&C (June 9th 2017). During this pregnancy they noted I had a little elevated blood pressure around 8 weeks which continued to climb. By 16 weeks I was put on blood pressure medication. At 23+2 I was hospitalized because my blood pressure reached 237/115. I was discharged on bed rest four days later but ended up going back after another 4 days and was admitted for hospital bed rest with constant monitoring. During this I was pricked every 4-6 hours for blood labs to check liver enzymes and kidney function. At 26+2 I began having the dreaded upper right quadrant pain and my liver enzymes started to climb. Our beautiful boy was born via emergency C-section at 26+3(May 6th) due to high liver enzymes and a declining platelet count. We had a very emotional 40 days in the NICU until we had to say goodbye to our Superman (June 14th). His lungs were severally underdeveloped even with two rounds of steroid injections due to IUGR. I'm still recovering physically from the HELLP syndrome.

92,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place for this post, so sorry in advance if it isn't. I've been having a hard time lately. I was 10 weeks pregnant and had an ectopic removal surgery on April 15th of this year. I've had two cycles since then, and my body is pretty much back to normal now as far as that goes. I've seen a therapist most weeks since everything happened. My anxiety has gotten to a manageable level and so has the depression. I don't feel like I'm particularly anxious or depressed anymore, I just have my days.

After everything happened, because of having my right tube removed, and being told by the surgeon that my remaining tube was scarred pretty badly, I began to look into my other options. Not because I was ready to explore them then and there, but just to reassure myself that there was still hope for the future of me being a mother, and that this was not necessarily the end of the road. I explored the options of adoption, and gestational surrogacy as these seemed the most likely options for my personal situation.

My S/O was not supportive of either. He did not like the idea of trusting someone else with safely carrying our child via gestational surrogacy. We are both very health conscious and part of his reasoning stems from the fact that obviously you cannot control what another puts in their mouth or exposes themselves to, and having a person carrying your child would increase the anxiety of worrying about every little thing they do. I completely understand his point on this.

The other option, adopting...He was very against this as well. I have heard of a lot of men who have a similar stance. Something to do with them not being their blood...worrying that the child would have 'issues' as many adopted children/adults that we have known personally have...But I also know several adopted children/adults who DO NOT have 'issues' and actually recognize that they are tremendously loved because they were 'hand picked' so to speak.

Now it has been almost 2 months since everything happened. My S/O and I have been living together and in a relationship for around 5 years and have known each other for almost 20 years. We used to be the 'we don't need to be legally married to prove our love' type couple. But after looking into requirements for adoption and discovering that many countries prefer couples to have been married for at least 5 years...My stance has changed. Yesterday, I went to have lunch with him at work, and told him that I wanted him to consider us getting married, so that if one day in the future, we decided we wanted to adopt we would already be ahead and wouldn't have to wait 5 years to do so. I am almost 26 and he is 24 so 5 years from now would put us at 31 and 29. A lot can change in that time. He once again said that he does not want to adopt. I asked him 'what if that was the only way I could be a mother?' And he said that maybe it means that I wasn't meant to be a mother.

I guess it just hurts me that he is so dismissive of these ideas. I do not by any means want to force him into either of these ideas. I would never want a child who had already been given up to not be truly wanted by one of their adoptive parents. Our pregnancy that ended in the ectopic was unplanned, but it did reaffirm that I definitely want to be a mother one day, even though I already knew that. 

When we found out about the pregnancy, we both started scrambling to 'get our lives together' in preparation for the baby. He started working full\-time and enrolled in online school for criminal justice (he wants to be a cop in the next couple years). I re\-enrolled in college to finish the last course for my B.A. At this point it just makes me sad, because I know if things had worked out, I would be 4 months pregnant right now, and he would be excited about being a father like he was before things went south. I don't know the right way to go about revisiting these subjects, or helping him to understand why I feel like marriage and/or gestational surrogacy and/or adoption are so important to me. 

If anyone has any similar experiences or advice, I am open to anything right now. I'm not trying to push him so I have been choosing wisely how often to bring these things up.",t2_yc0a9k7,False,,0,False,S/O does not want to consider other avenues of having kids and I'm sad,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8qlh1q,False,dark,1.0,,public,16,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,16,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1528857834.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m not sure if this is the appropriate place for this post, so sorry in advance if it isn&#39;t.

Not because I was ready to explore them then and there, but just to reassure myself that there was still hope for the future of me being a mother, and that this was not necessarily the end of the road. I explored the options of adoption, and gestational surrogacy as these seemed the most likely options for my personal situation.</p>

<p>My S/O was not supportive of either. He did not like the idea of trusting someone else with safely carrying our child via gestational surrogacy. We are both very health conscious and part of his reasoning stems from the fact that obviously you cannot control what another puts in their mouth or exposes themselves to, and having a person carrying your child would increase the anxiety of worrying about every little thing they do. I completely understand his point on this.</p>

<p>The other option, adopting...He was very against this as well. I have heard of a lot of men who have a similar stance. Something to do with them not being their blood...worrying that the child would have &#39;issues&#39; as many adopted children/adults that we have known personally have...But I also know several adopted children/adults who DO NOT have &#39;issues&#39; and actually recognize that they are tremendously loved because they were &#39;hand picked&#39; so to speak.</p>

<p>Now it has been almost 2 months since everything happened. My S/O and I have been living together and in a relationship for around 5 years and have known each other for almost 20 years. We used to be the &#39;we don&#39;t need to be legally married to prove our love&#39; type couple. But after looking into requirements for adoption and discovering that many countries prefer couples to have been married for at least 5 years...My stance has changed. Yesterday, I went to have lunch with him at work, and told him that I wanted him to consider us getting married, so that if one day in the future, we decided we wanted to adopt we would already be ahead and wouldn&#39;t have to wait 5 years to do so. I am almost 26 and he is 24 so 5 years from now would put us at 31 and 29. A lot can change in that time. He once again said that he does not want to adopt. I asked him &#39;what if that was the only way I could be a mother?&#39; And he said that maybe it means that I wasn&#39;t meant to be a mother.</p>

<p>I guess it just hurts me that he is so dismissive of these ideas. I do not by any means want to force him into either of these ideas. I would never want a child who had already been given up to not be truly wanted by one of their adoptive parents. Our pregnancy that ended in the ectopic was unplanned, but it did reaffirm that I definitely want to be a mother one day, even though I already knew that. </p>

<p>When we found out about the pregnancy, we both started scrambling to &#39;get our lives together&#39; in preparation for the baby. He started working full-time and enrolled in online school for criminal justice (he wants to be a cop in the next couple years). I re-enrolled in college to finish the last course for my B.A. At this point it just makes me sad, because I know if things had worked out, I would be 4 months pregnant right now, and he would be excited about being a father like he was before things went south. I don&#39;t know the right way to go about revisiting these subjects, or helping him to understand why I feel like marriage and/or gestational surrogacy and/or adoption are so important to me. </p>

<p>If anyone has any similar experiences or advice, I am open to anything right now. I&#39;m not trying to push him so I have been choosing wisely how often to bring these things up.</p>

We started talking about a second child despite my fear of birth as our first was very very rough. That was in September or October, and we started trying in December when I got my period back 13 months postpartum. 

We tried since then with temping and tracking CM and we found out we were expecting a week before my husband's birthday in May. I had a lot of fears but overall I was elated and my husband was out of his mind excited.

I know we want at least one more child but I am horrified at the thought of another loss. 

I need help figuring this all out. We really don't have friends who have lost pregnancies that we are close with and many of our other friends are pregnant or TTC.

I've reached a point now where I feel like my relationship is struggling as well. My partner barely wants to have sex once week let alone every other day, so I feel like he isn't even trying anymore. I know he's probably stressed as well but I'm trying really hard not to blow a fuse.  

I feel really let down with how he handled the miscarriage as well. Obviously we were both hurting, he took 2 days off work when we found out about the missed miscarriage to sit with me. But the weekend I started to miscarry naturally he had left to watch a sports game with friends. I texted him to say I was miscarrying but he stayed out anyway and never came home that night. The miscarriage lasted 2 weeks, the following weekend he went out drinking with friends again, said he didn't like to see me in pain. He's pretty much been out every single weekend since, sometimes I go with him, at first I would feel a little emotional but I've learnt to cope with it now. 3 weeks after the miscarriage he told me I should be over it by now and to stop using it as an excuse to start arguments because it was his loss too. I just feel like I'm expressing myself.

We've booked a holiday with his family, I would have been 8 months when we depart. We initially didn't book the holiday because I was pregnant, but since I lost the baby everyone said we may as well have something to look forward to, I don't know why but that really grates on me. I lost a baby, a holiday isn't going to make me feel better about that. I even feel like my boyfriend is more excited about the holiday than he ever was about the baby.

My co worker is also halfway through her pregnancy, which is gutting for me. No one at work knew about my pregnancy or the miscarriage (I didn't want to harm my chances of job progression until it was safe to announce my plans for a family), so I have to plaster a smile on my face and ask her all the pregnancy related questions that people should have been asking me.

My boyfriends cousin is also pregnant, I was due within the same week as her. It kills me to see her happy and pregnant. We had a family party recently and I got so disastrously drunk because I just couldn't cope. I feel like such a mess right now with no one to talk to. I just feel like I won't be happy now until I finally have a baby of my own.

My due date is approaching as well which is just making it all 10 times worse. I've rejoined the gym and go every day just for something to take my mind off this pain.

(Tldr version: drug addict brother's drug addict baby mama gave birth to a healthy baby boy and I am here about to burry my baby boy and my mom decided to tell me all about it despite it being extremely hard for me to hear.)

 A week and a half ago I found out my baby boys heart had stopped beating at 24 weeks gestation. I had just heard his heartbeat 6 days before, but went in because I hadn't felt him move in a day or so. And I found out he was no longer living. I gave birth 8 days ago to the most perfect little boy with seemingly nothing wrong with him other than the fact that he wasn't alive. We have no answers as to what could have happened and my husband and I are completely devestated. 

My mom came to stay with us the last couple days to help me around the house, help with my kids, and help us plan his funeral. This morning she was leaving to go back home. And after she got everything packed, she started talking about my brother. My brother is a 35 year old drug addict who is just about the worst person in the world. My mom doesn't know this, but he tried to molest me when I was a girl. He's abusive to every girlfriend he has ever had, to me, my other siblings, to my parents and to his 13 year old daughter that my parents have raised since she was a baby. His baby mama (they are not together because he is abusive) just gave birth to a baby boy sometime in the last week or so. My mom decided to talk all about how this baby could be what my brother needs to get away from herion. And how luckily the baby doesn't have to suffer widthdrals because the baby mama stopped doing herion before he was born.... It broke my heart to hear about their healthy baby boy after the mom was doing hard drugs and smoking throughout the Pregnacy. Meanwhile I was was perfectly healthy through my pregnancy. Never even had a sip of alcohol and I've never smoked in my life and my baby died... I began to cry... My mom kept going on and on about him while I was crying, not taking the hint.

Then I find out that my family told my mom not to tell me about their baby because it would be too hard for me to hear. She did anyway. And she planned it to be right before she left. I feel like she gets off on other people's sadness. Not two minutes after she left, she called my sister to tell her about how she told me and I cried and how dramatic it all was.

I really only started on this learning journey about 2 weeks ago. So a short background first.

I came off of BC July of last year. The hubs an I decided to just let nature take its course and if it happened great, if not that is fine as well. I found myself caring more and more as the months have rolled by. But life got crazy busy and we maybe weren't trying as hard as we could. Fast forward to 2ish weeks ago, my BF mentions she thinks she might be preggers, and I comment how I was pretty late, as in 50 days late. And the previous monthly visitor was light spotting. So I finally got a chance to purchase test and it came back BFP, another one did and then next day the same. Needless to say I was THRILLED. This all happened over the holiday weekend (Memorial Day) so I couldn't do anything to call the doc till Tues morning. Math was coming back that I was probably 8 weeks or so. I call Tues get an appointment for last Thurs. My DH and I go and get blind\-sided by them telling us that the urine test was coming up BFN. I was heartbroken and totally lost. Doc wanted to test my blood and see what it came back, so Fri was told I was at hCG 33. And wanted me back Sat morning to test again and came back Mon saying it was down to 30 and progesterone went from .4 to .2. They state that is a MC but I STILL haven't had any bleeding since the first week of April. And I haven't heard from the doc AT ALL. Only communication I have gotten is from the lab.

They have me scheduled to come in again for my blood to get tested again on Monday morning. But in the meantime I feel like I am just out here with my ass blowing in the wind. I have GFs commenting about how I am in such a bad mood, or plopping down to tell me how they think they are preggers just because she gagged on her toothbrush that am.. And I am over here angry and lost. I did jump on amazon and got some OPK and I did just purchase the AVA bracelet like a month ago because I was wanting to start to figure out what was up with my body, clearly not knowing that we already had a BFP.

So with all that being said... Should I be worried that I still haven't had any sign of AF coming? My doc seems to not give a crap. I off course am scared that my body hasn't cleared itself out yet and I have read that I could get a infection. And clearly the friends I have are not super helpful.

138,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"This is going to be long. Was going to post this in the daily thread but realized it was becoming a huge novel so decided to make my own post. Hold onto your butts ladies. It's a long one. Prepare for my brain's overload to just vomit forth:

I'm frustrated. I'm having doubts over the direction the OB/GYN is choosing to take with my treatment. A month ago we saw the OB after the MRI and he said without a doubt we have PCOS and that might be our major issue with conceiving the last year. He decided we were going to go conservative in our approach and start using Letrozole (Femara) for 3 months to see if we could get me to ovulate and get me pregnant. If in 3 months there's no sign of a baby then we would reevaluate then.

I'm now having doubts. DH and I were like bunnies last month. Every other day (occasionally we did every day because holy hormones batman!) we would get down and funky. I felt all kinds of screwed up in the last 7-10 days before my period, more than my usual PMS symptoms and swore up and down I was pregnant. Boobs hurt, and were much larger, stomach was all kinds of funny feeling. Emotional as balls and would go from exploding with happy over silly stupid things to just sobbing like an idiot over something trivial (walked out of daycare drop off when my son wanted the harmonica from another little there. He looked at me and had this completely heartbroken huge pout on his face. Normally I would have been fine seeing that, sad for him, but fine. We walked out the door and I burst into tears. Not. Normal.) Yet my period showed up with such ferocity that it started these doubts.

I'm now on day 3 of my second course of Letrozole and it's different this time. Or maybe it's just I know what to expect so this isn't so weird and new and exciting like last month. I don't know. But I'm starting to wonder if I shouldn't just push for the surgery anyways. He said the cyst that everyone was so so so scared about was about 2.5cm. So like the size of a small grape to put into regular people terms. But while he was going to do surgery to remove this cyst he was also going to get ""all up in my junk"" and do a therapeutic D&C and also take a look at my tubes to see if they were blocked or something.

Now a month later and much time in my own head, I'm wondering if something wasn't missed in the original miscarriage treatment which is causing issues conceiving. That my uterus itself is now inhospitable because there was something super minor left behind that is making my body go ""nah we don't need you tiny fertilized egg! GTFO"" but there isn't enough to cause a positive pregnancy test, stop my period etc. 

The other thing I have floating around in my head is I remember my periods from before having my son, they were very painful for the first day or two, where I would then pass pretty much my entire uterine lining all in one go. Cramps would be instantly gone and it would be another 2-5 days of slowly lessening bleeding before we got back to business as usual free of absorbent ""stuff"" down there. I realized this past period, I don't know the last time I had a period like that. But I can't pinpoint the exact timing of when that all stopped. Was it after I had my son? And this is just my new normal after having a child of my own? Or was this after the miscarriage? I can't honestly pinpoint it on the timeline of my last 2.5 years but there was, at some point, a very clear shift between my period ""before"" and my periods ""after"". 

Now that I'm really into monitoring ""all of the things"" when it comes to fertility (CM, cramping, cervical positioning and firmness/open/closed status etc) I've noticed my cervix constantly feels much lower than I ever remember it being. And most specifically since the miscarriage. So I'm wondering now am I having a mild prolapse that somehow no one saw between multiple different types of imaging (U/S and MRI specifically) as well as a regular physical with my GP? Is that a thing? Could that be missed so easily? So now I'm wondering if maybe my cervix is causing my husband's swimmers to miss the mark completely because they simply aren't able to find where they are supposed to go? Has everything shifted positioning so much that the shedding of my uterine lining gotten fucked up and that is causing some kind of blockage for the swimmers, and/or my body rejecting the possibility of carrying a pregnancy now?

I'm a bundle of questions and no answers. Yes, I know, I need to see the doctor and have a word vomit of all of these questions and concerns, but I'm a person who always puts others first, and I don't want to ""take an appointment slot away from someone who needs it's *more* than I do. I'm not having any *real* issues right now. Maybe someone else needs it *more* than me so I won't bother until after next month if we don't get pregnant""

Tl;Dr - I have noticed changes, not sure when they happened. Could these things be real or are they all in my head? Did the original Dr from my care during the miscarriage miss something that is causing my infertility now and not having surgery is just prolonging this issue?

Was going to post this in the daily thread but realized it was becoming a huge novel so decided to make my own post. Hold onto your butts ladies. It&#39;s a long one. Prepare for my brain&#39;s overload to just vomit forth:</p>

<p>I&#39;m frustrated. I&#39;m having doubts over the direction the OB/GYN is choosing to take with my treatment. A month ago we saw the OB after the MRI and he said without a doubt we have PCOS and that might be our major issue with conceiving the last year. He decided we were going to go conservative in our approach and start using Letrozole (Femara) for 3 months to see if we could get me to ovulate and get me pregnant. If in 3 months there&#39;s no sign of a baby then we would reevaluate then.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now having doubts. DH and I were like bunnies last month. Every other day (occasionally we did every day because holy hormones batman!) we would get down and funky. I felt all kinds of screwed up in the last 7-10 days before my period, more than my usual PMS symptoms and swore up and down I was pregnant. Boobs hurt, and were much larger, stomach was all kinds of funny feeling. Emotional as balls and would go from exploding with happy over silly stupid things to just sobbing like an idiot over something trivial (walked out of daycare drop off when my son wanted the harmonica from another little there. He looked at me and had this completely heartbroken huge pout on his face. Normally I would have been fine seeing that, sad for him, but fine. We walked out the door and I burst into tears. Not. Normal.) Yet my period showed up with such ferocity that it started these doubts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now on day 3 of my second course of Letrozole and it&#39;s different this time. Or maybe it&#39;s just I know what to expect so this isn&#39;t so weird and new and exciting like last month. I don&#39;t know. But I&#39;m starting to wonder if I shouldn&#39;t just push for the surgery anyways. He said the cyst that everyone was so so so scared about was about 2.5cm. So like the size of a small grape to put into regular people terms. But while he was going to do surgery to remove this cyst he was also going to get &quot;all up in my junk&quot; and do a therapeutic D&amp;C and also take a look at my tubes to see if they were blocked or something.</p>

<p>Now a month later and much time in my own head, I&#39;m wondering if something wasn&#39;t missed in the original miscarriage treatment which is causing issues conceiving. That my uterus itself is now inhospitable because there was something super minor left behind that is making my body go &quot;nah we don&#39;t need you tiny fertilized egg! GTFO&quot; but there isn&#39;t enough to cause a positive pregnancy test, stop my period etc. </p>

<p>The other thing I have floating around in my head is I remember my periods from before having my son, they were very painful for the first day or two, where I would then pass pretty much my entire uterine lining all in one go. Cramps would be instantly gone and it would be another 2-5 days of slowly lessening bleeding before we got back to business as usual free of absorbent &quot;stuff&quot; down there. I realized this past period, I don&#39;t know the last time I had a period like that. But I can&#39;t pinpoint the exact timing of when that all stopped. Was it after I had my son? And this is just my new normal after having a child of my own? Or was this after the miscarriage? I can&#39;t honestly pinpoint it on the timeline of my last 2.5 years but there was, at some point, a very clear shift between my period &quot;before&quot; and my periods &quot;after&quot;. </p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m really into monitoring &quot;all of the things&quot; when it comes to fertility (CM, cramping, cervical positioning and firmness/open/closed status etc) I&#39;ve noticed my cervix constantly feels much lower than I ever remember it being. And most specifically since the miscarriage. So I&#39;m wondering now am I having a mild prolapse that somehow no one saw between multiple different types of imaging (U/S and MRI specifically) as well as a regular physical with my GP? Is that a thing? Could that be missed so easily? So now I&#39;m wondering if maybe my cervix is causing my husband&#39;s swimmers to miss the mark completely because they simply aren&#39;t able to find where they are supposed to go? Has everything shifted positioning so much that the shedding of my uterine lining gotten fucked up and that is causing some kind of blockage for the swimmers, and/or my body rejecting the possibility of carrying a pregnancy now?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bundle of questions and no answers. Yes, I know, I need to see the doctor and have a word vomit of all of these questions and concerns, but I&#39;m a person who always puts others first, and I don&#39;t want to &quot;take an appointment slot away from someone who needs it&#39;s <em>more</em> than I do. I&#39;m not having any <em>real</em> issues right now. Maybe someone else needs it <em>more</em> than me so I won&#39;t bother until after next month if we don&#39;t get pregnant&quot;</p>

I think I promised this in a previous post. For background, I have had an 11 week MMC, measuring around 8 weeks, a 9 week MMC, measuring around 7 weeks, and 3 CPs. \n\nWe had a whole lot of bloodwork, and I had a hysteroscopy and and HSG since our last appointment. \n\n*Bloodwork*\n\nI was tested for a wide variety of clotting and immuno factors, and for thyroid dysfunction and blood sugar issues.  Happy to write everything out if someone wants.  Everything was totally normal. \n\nI mentioned to our RE that my MIL has factor V leiden, and he ordered a few more clotting tests, and a factor V test for my husband.  I don\'t think my husband having factor V has any bearing on our RPL, but he said my husband should know his result for general health reasons. \n\nI asked about MTHFR and he said he no longer tested for it. \n\n*Uterine* \n\nMy hysteroscopy found a thing in my uterus, but as I\'ve posted before, I think it came out during my period post hysteroscopy.  It was a small bean-sized hard piece of yellow-ish tissue.  When I say my hysteroscopy images I was like, oh yeah, that was it. My RE said it was probably retained placental tissue from one of my pregnancies. Yaaaaaay. \n\nHSG confirmed that the... thing.... is gone. \n\nI have an arcuate or possibly sub-septate uterus.  RE says that we could preform resection surgery, but there is no evidentiary basis to conclude that it would help.  Based on what the doc who performed the hysteroscopy said, and what I saw on the screen, I believe that it is arcuate, and have opted out of surgery for now. \n\n*Genetic*\n\nOur genetic testing is not back yet.  Our last pregnancy had T13.  It is a small chance that we have a translocation, but given our history, I think it is a possibility. Those results are TBD, and could take 4 more weeks. \n\n*Other*\n\nI asked about sperm DNA fragmentation.  Our RE said that he is currently engaged in meta-analysis about unexplained RPL, and that is one of the issues under investigation.  He declined to order a test.  It is not covered by our public health insurance, we are seeing a private RE in 3 months, and finally: what are we going to do with the results?  He said that sperm DNA frag is highly variable over time, and that it wouldn\'t change his opinion of what we should do. He said smoking and alcohol are the two biggest environmental factors (my husband just quit smoking, so yay for him, but jesus a little late in the game?). \n\n*Prognosis*\n\nHe said that we have a 65% - 80% change of a live birth, and that IVF might decrease our time to pregnancy, but statistically it does not increase our chances of live birth. \n\nI asked him what he would do under the circumstances, given that I\'m 34 and we want more than 1 child.  He said he would try for at least one more year without ART. He said he thought we would be back to see him pregnant before our August private RE appointment, which made me *ROLL MY EYES* but he\'s not a bullshitter - I think he really believes that. \n\nOverall, I\'m... I\'m ok.  I expected those results.  Of course, my husband and I immediately went and got a couple of drinks. So, maybe that\'s why we\'re not pregnant. \n\nI have another year in me, I think - but not a lot more.  I think I want to keep our appointment at the private RE cause I\'m over this ""trying naturally"" shit and what it does to my life and my emotions. \n\n', 'author_fullname': 't2_il3xu', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'RPL follow-up recap', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Update'}, {'a': ':upvote:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/ad1td4bx9ezz_t5_3nqvj/upvote'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/stilltrying', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 0, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_8ov6ko', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 4, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': '063e5418-11df-11e4-a84d-12313b0d3999', 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Update:upvote:', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 4, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'RPL - 6 losses'}], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1528266196.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 0, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'richtext', 'domain': 'self.stilltrying', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Just had my RPL follow up - I will xpost in stilltrying and ttcafterloss, for anyone who is interested.

Everything was totally normal. </p>\n\n<p>I mentioned to our RE that my MIL has factor V leiden, and he ordered a few more clotting tests, and a factor V test for my husband.  I don&#39;t think my husband having factor V has any bearing on our RPL, but he said my husband should know his result for general health reasons. </p>\n\n<p>I asked about MTHFR and he said he no longer tested for it. </p>\n\n<p><em>Uterine</em> </p>\n\n<p>My hysteroscopy found a thing in my uterus, but as I&#39;ve posted before, I think it came out during my period post hysteroscopy.  It was a small bean-sized hard piece of yellow-ish tissue.  When I say my hysteroscopy images I was like, oh yeah, that was it. My RE said it was probably retained placental tissue from one of my pregnancies. Yaaaaaay. </p>\n\n<p>HSG confirmed that the... thing.... is gone. </p>\n\n<p>I have an arcuate or possibly sub-septate uterus.  RE says that we could preform resection surgery, but there is no evidentiary basis to conclude that it would help.  Based on what the doc who performed the hysteroscopy said, and what I saw on the screen, I believe that it is arcuate, and have opted out of surgery for now. </p>\n\n<p><em>Genetic</em></p>\n\n<p>Our genetic testing is not back yet.  Our last pregnancy had T13.  It is a small chance that we have a translocation, but given our history, I think it is a possibility. Those results are TBD, and could take 4 more weeks. </p>\n\n<p><em>Other</em></p>\n\n<p>I asked about sperm DNA fragmentation.  Our RE said that he is currently engaged in meta-analysis about unexplained RPL, and that is one of the issues under investigation.  He declined to order a test.  It is not covered by our public health insurance, we are seeing a private RE in 3 months, and finally: what are we going to do with the results?  He said that sperm DNA frag is highly variable over time, and that it wouldn&#39;t change his opinion of what we should do. He said smoking and alcohol are the two biggest environmental factors (my husband just quit smoking, so yay for him, but jesus a little late in the game?). </p>\n\n<p><em>Prognosis</em></p>\n\n<p>He said that we have a 65% - 80% change of a live birth, and that IVF might decrease our time to pregnancy, but statistically it does not increase our chances of live birth. </p>\n\n<p>I asked him what he would do under the circumstances, given that I&#39;m 34 and we want more than 1 child.  He said he would try for at least one more year without ART. He said he thought we would be back to see him pregnant before our August private RE appointment, which made me <em>ROLL MY EYES</em> but he&#39;s not a bullshitter - I think he really believes that. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, I&#39;m... I&#39;m ok.  I expected those results.  Of course, my husband and I immediately went and got a couple of drinks. So, maybe that&#39;s why we&#39;re not pregnant. </p>\n\n<p>I have another year in me, I think - but not a lot more.  I think I want to keep our appointment at the private RE cause I&#39;m over this &quot;trying naturally&quot; shit and what it does to my life and my emotions. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '8b33a0be-a015-11e4-8fba-22000b3c84ba', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': 'RPL - 6 losses', 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_32ktv', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': '8ov6ko', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'robotneedslove', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 8, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'permalink': '/r/stilltrying/comments/8ov6ko/rpl_followup_recap/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stilltrying/comments/8ov6ko/rpl_followup_recap/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 7185, 'created_utc': 1528237396.0, 'num_crossposts': 1, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",t3_8ov6ko
