6,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I had a D&C due to a MMC two days after Easter and two weeks after I had announced our pregnancy. A month after my loss I was invited back to be a bridesmaid in my friends wedding on 09/22 which I initially had to decline since I was due 09/20. My husband and I have been trying after the initial suggested skip. I was two days late on 09/11 so I had been cautiously hopeful that I was going to get to have a new pregnancy to keep me afloat during my should be due date but I work up the morning and there it was. 

My husband and I were sitting on the couch after work watching TV trying to just keep our minds off it and my MIL (who we moved in with due to the pregnancy to better be able to save money for a down-payment) came home from wherever she was that day and the very first thing out of her mouth was ""Wow! I just spent a lot of money on 'nephew' for Christmas -- by the time you have a baby I'll be broke!"" 

We just stared at her in disbelief and she just kept jabbering away about what she had gotten our nephew until she realized we weren't really talking to her and went back downstairs. I had to turn to my husband and say ""Did she really just say that..."" That was the beginning of the crappy week. 

Fast forward to prepping for the wedding -- I took off the 20th even though we didn't have anything wedding related we needed to do that day and my husband and I just sat on the couch watching TV all day again trying to not think about our should be due date. Then the next day myself and the other bridesmaids were setting up the reception venue and about to order lunch when one of our friends announced that since she was pregnant she couldn't have deli meat. My heart dropped and I had to leave the room to go hide out for a good 20 minutes before I felt ready enough to come out and participate in the rest of the wedding weekend. I congratulated my friend because I am really happy for her and her husband - they had been trying for a year before they got this BFP - and tried to focus on the wedding. 

It worked for part of the night but then since another bridesmaid in the wedding is due in November - both of them spent most of the weekend talking about their pregnancies. I joined in since I personally can talk about what it was like being pregnant for me but every time I tried I felt like my friend brushed me off and didn't really take any of my advice (eat a cracker or two before you get out of bed, take constant sips of water, ginger tea or gingins are good to have on hand, ect.) unless the other bridesmaid confirmed it. Which just really made me feel worse. 

The wedding whirlwind is over and I'm now in my TWW for my 6th cycle after my MC - if I don't get my positive in October I get to go back to start infertility testing all over again. With all that has happened in the last two weeks I feel like there is no way its going to happen because I am so stressed and can't do a single thing to keep my mind off this. Everything that my MIL said and all the little things my friend did are running though my head on a constant loop. 

I moved my Glow app from my main screen on my phone and told my husband my expected period date and assigned him to tell me ""hey, you're late"" if I don't tell him I got my period a few days after the date in an attempt to remove the constant focus. I just needed to post this so I could vent and get it all out in another attempt to remove my focus from the ""what if"" cycle my brain takes me on. Hopefully I can actually relax for the next few weeks and I hope that everyone else in here is able to do the same and soon enough we will get our rainbows.

I had spent the majority of my pregnancy sort of indifferent to the fact that I was having a baby. I had 10,000 other things to do before the baby arrived, and didn’t have time to think about it just yet. What no one else knew, except my husband, is that I had a feeling that something was wrong. I think the first time I said it, I was 8 weeks. I continually had feelings of regret about the pregnancy, as I was overwhelmed with getting my life in order before September, and secretly wished that I had never gotten pregnant, or worse, that something was wrong so I wouldn’t have to have this baby.

Maybe someone out there heard me. My OB didn’t find a heart beat with the Doppler. He rushed me down to ultrasound, and there was my baby: perfect, but still, and measuring 16 weeks exactly. I was alone. I texted my husband the most horrific words anyone can read: “it died.” I drove home. I felt numb. I called our parents, told them the news, texted my friends, and scheduled a baby sitter for my daughter during my induction on Saturday. Then I waited. My husband tried to go to work the next day, but came home within hours. We played video games all day to distract ourselves. I found it difficult to look at my daughter, knowing what I’d lost. I felt disgusted with myself: I had a dead thing inside me, and couldn’t scrub away the shame.

Saturday came. It was the most boring day of my life. 10x the normal dose of Cervidil every 4 hours. I slept a lot. I signed tons of paperwork, including a death certificate. I cycled through morphine and some other hardcore drugs to manage my lovely back labor. I got an epidural (which failed during my daughter’s birth), which was amazing. I went to sleep. My baby was born at 10:49PM on April 29, 2017. I physically felt nothing; I was literally sleeping as he was born, and my husband shook me awake, saying he heard a gush. I told him to get out of the room, so I could save him from the aftermath. He left. I emotionally felt relieved that it was over, that I could go back to my life. I joked with the doctor and the nurses. Looking back, I think they thought I was high off my ass, and maybe I was. I never held my baby. I didn’t know the sex. It was just gone. 

I was released the next day after a psych eval (previous history of being a stupid teenager). I felt fine, physically. Nothing hurt. I just wanted to sleep. 

A few days later, my breasts started dripping. I had breastfed my daughter for 2 years, and had weaned her 8 months prior in anticipation of TTC. I had already decided that, if this happened, I would pump and donate the milk. So I did. 8-12 times every day. It gave me purpose, gave me a schedule. If nothing else, I **had** to wake up, get out of bed, and pump. And for a long time, that was all that really kept me going. 

It took about a week to sink in. I felt more love for my baby after it was gone than I ever did while it was with me. I feel guilty about that. But I cried less and less. I got better. I went back to work, a few hours at a time. I quit pumping after a month. My husband and I took our babymoon staycation, and we did tons of things I couldn’t have done while pregnant. We didn’t talk about our baby. It was healing. My period came back on our last day away, 32 days after birth. I was thrilled. 

A month later, the pathology came in. My biggest regret of anything regarding my loss is reading the pathology. Sitting right at the top was “SEX: MALE.” I had a son. I have a living daughter, whom I love more than anything, but I could have had a son. Unknown cause of death. I relapsed hard. Eventually, I pulled myself out of the pit. 

**[TW: current pregnancy]** In July, I got pregnant again. You guys might remember that I gave my husband a variety of things so that he could read the test and tell me accordingly. I was met with a gift basket, and on top, was the rainbow PJs that I had lovingly and painfully sewed the month before, when I had felt optimistic about the future. I sobbed with grief.

So now, I’ll be 11+3 weeks pregnant on my due date with my third child. I’m still in committee-limbo for finishing my degree, but have given my advisor a “November or I quit” finish date. My husband has interviews in the same city as his family when we come back from Hawaii. I’m packing and cleaning our house to sell and move, and looking for a daycare in a top-10 city that will take two kids on relatively short notice. I’m job searching, to no avail. I’m just as stressed as I was in April, with the same damn problems. It was all for nothing. There was no reason for anything.

I’m struggling with accepting this pregnancy. Most days, I don’t feel pregnant. I try to connect with my baby, since I know schlee could only be with me for a short time. I bought a fetal Doppler to use at home. I solidly found the heartbeat yesteday, and it was soothing. Sometimes I still feel stressed, and think we should have waited. But I don’t feel like something is wrong. I don’t feel the sense of regret that I did before. I am still so deep in the closet, as many of you seem to be or have done. I told a few friends, who I know would be there for me in case of another loss. But my family is oblivious, and will hopefully remain that way until our anatomy scan (or preferably, birth). 

But my son. He’s the first thing I think about when I wake, and the last thing I think about when I fall asleep. I would give a lot to have him here with me. I struggle with knowing that, without his loss, that my current baby wouldn’t be baking, and that we wouldn’t have saved the lives of 5 preemies with our milk donation. I struggle with this sense of “meant to be”, knowing that without a miscarriage, my husband wouldn’t have been born, so neither would my daughter. I’m agnostic, but I can’t help but wonder if maybe he’s come back to us in this new body. I can’t help but fear that someone heard my pleas, and took my son from me out of pity. I can’t help but worry that in 50 years, a little boy will look at me accusingly and ask why I didn’t want him. 

All I’ll have to remember him by is his hospital blanket, some terrible ultrasound photos, a breast milk locket (that hasn’t arrived yet), a plaque with “Baby X” at the local milk bank to symbolize our donation (haven’t been to see it, so no picture), a program from our local pregnancy/baby loss group‘s annual celebration of life (which is in October, so don’t have that yet, either), and this letter.  My husband built a [memory box](https://imgur.com/9Jr34ow) for him in the shape of a book, to tell his story: 

A story that I’ve just now told you, so that maybe one more person besides me might remember him.

Started miscarrying 3 weeks ago, bled heavily for maybe 4-5 days, then have been spotting on and off since then.  Now, I only ""spot"" when wiping myself after sex.  Otherwise, feeling physically and emotionally fine if a bit disappointed.

Had follow-up OB appointment today where an ultrasound determined that there are still some material inside.  It's not enough for it to be of concern or to warrant a D&C.  In fact the OB advises against a D&C and to let my body expel the material on its own.  He's expecting that my next major bleed (probably next period) will likely clear up most of it.  In any event, he's benched us from getting pregnant for 2 months, and wants to see me for a follow-up appointment in 3 months.

So, I understand his reasoning to avoid getting pregnant until the uterus has had time to clear out whatever is left over.  In some ways, I'm OK with this.  It would be nice to have a few months of not fretting over OPKs or HPTs, or worrying about what excuse to give coworkers who want to go out for happy hour drinks.  I certainly wouldn't want to get pregnant while there is still left over tissue in my uterus that would likely compromise the pregnancy anyway and end up pushing back even further when we're given the clear to resume TTC.   But I'm already 35 and feel like the biological clock is *really* ticking.

In the meantime, I'm going to see my genetic counselor and get the carrier screening and karyotype testing done, and see if she will also order mtfhr testing as well or if that's something I'd need to see another specialist for.  If we're benched for 2 months, may as well be productive and get as many tests out of the way as possible.

On that note, how would you ladies interpret ""don't get pregnant for 2 months""?  Meaning wait until the first cycle after Nov 19, or the first ovulation after Nov 19?

**Update:** Just got a call back from the genetic counselor's office.  My insurance requires pre-authorization so they're going to get that going and I should hear back in 10-15 business days on how much (if any) of the tests will be covered by insurance.

My only time conceiving resulted in an ectopic pregnancy loss in May 2017. Initially the doctor thought I was having a miscarriage and I had a D&C with no POC found in pathology. They figured I must have passed the tissue at home before the D&C without realizing. I had several ultrasounds with doctors after my D&C because I was still having pain and bleeding. I finally had a diagnostic quality ultrasound with an ultrasound tech at my insistence and he found an ectopic pregnancy 2 weeks after my D&C when I was 9 weeks along. Unfortunately I was rushed to ER by the ultrasound tech with no explanation other than the ER nurse saying they found a ""mass on my ovary."" I spent about 4 hours waiting in the ER waiting room thinking I might have a tumor on my ovary or an ectopic pregnancy. While I was crying in the waiting room (I don't usually cry in public, but I was so upset and scared) an older man looked at me and said ""come on, it's not so bad."" I was eventually taken back to a trauma room and told they thought it was an ectopic pregnancy (I was actually so relieved that it wasn't cancer, even though I knew EPs were very serious). I had emergency surgery and the EP was removed from my left tube. They were able to leave the tube in place. They did see endometriosis during my surgery and associated scarring. The doctor told me it may have been a heterotopic pregnancy that resulted in miscarriage of the uterine pregnancy and a pregnancy in my left tube. I honestly don't think there was ever a pregnancy in my uterus though since they only ound normal endometrial tissue in pathology and I never passed big clots at home. I am a nurse, so I totally get that medicine and diagnosis are imperfect, but I do worry a little about the competency of my OBs because multiple docs did ultrasounds before and after my D&C and all thought they saw a pregnancy in my uterus and not in my tubes. I even asked two separate doctors if the pregnancy could be in my tube while they were doing the ultrasounds and they said no. I was told to wait two cycles and start trying again immediately because my endometriosis is only going to continue damaging my body. I had a period a month after my surgery, but that bleeding continued on and off for over a month. I finally had my first normal period on August 31st, but I'm considering it my second cycle since I had the bleeding a month after surgery, even if it was abnormal, so we started trying again this month (to be honest, we didn't use protection a couple times last month, but I had  a normal period afterwards.

Now, I seem to have ovulated (maybe for the first time since surgery?) on my left side 5 days ago. I have been having a pinching pain in my left side for the past 5 days. Has anyone else experienced pain for 5+ days if you ovulate on your ectopic side?

TL; DR In May I had a D&C for presumed miscarriage at 7 weeks and then at 9 weeks had emergency surgery for ectopic pregnancy on the left side.

82,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"**edit** I've included a post at the bottom I wrote in the daily thread in case anyone in a similar situation ever searches for what has happened to others. 

I have my appointment with the consultant tomorrow to discuss George's post-mortem investigation results. I've been trying to think of questions I have in advance in case things aren't covered in what he tells me. A lot will obviously be dependent on what he says about the investigations, but here's the list I have so far. Some are specific to my circumstances and others are more general questions:

* I saw my GP around 2 weeks before his death for swollen and painful glands in my neck. The GP said it was probably just a virus or something (I wasn't feeling sick at all) - could this have been a sign of something?


* The week leading to his death I felt really terrible. Run down/very exhausted/stressed/agitated and in a lot of pain with my hips and back. I know a lot of this is generally how you feel at 34 weeks pregnant. I told my midwife the day before he died I was feeling this way and she booked me in for physiotherapy, but otherwise nothing was said. Should I have asked to be checked out further?


* At the midwife appointment the day before he died she asked if he'd just been kicking. I said no, he hadn't. His heart rate was fast, but she just said that it was fine. Another midwife has since told me that he should have been monitored if they detected a high heart rate. Why didn't this happen?


* In pregnancy it's generally advised you sleep on your left side. I have an old shoulder injury that prevented this so I slept mostly on my right side and sometimes my back. Could this have contributed to his death?


* I was on medication from the start of pregnancy for HG. I was also put on medication in later pregnancy for reflux/heartburn. Could this have contributed?


* I've had discharge from my nipples for years and my test results came back normal (prolactin/thyroid function). My research suggests that this issue isn't a condition in itself, but a symptom of another problem. Some of these problems can significantly increase the risk of stillbirth. Should I be tested for additional problems prior to another pregnancy?


* The midwife who delivered George commented that he was large for his gestational age. They believed he was going to be around 4lb and was just over 6lb at birth. It was mentioned in passing that gestational diabetes could have been a problem, despite my glucose test being negative. Is there any evidence of this in his results?


* The midwife commented that his cord was extremely thick when he was born. It wasn't wrapped around him to suggest cord accident, but could this have been related to his death?


* Was the cord and placenta normal?


* The consultant at the hospital advised that I should have tests for clotting problems. When will these tests be undertaken?


* What was tested for in the post-mortem? 


* Should I undergo any additional tests in any subsequent pregnancy?


* What would be the plan for any future pregnancy?


* Will I be considered high risk? Will I be induced early - if so, when?


* What are the chances of this happening again?


* What can I do to help prevent this happening again?


* Will this affect my chances of conceiving?

<p>I have my appointment with the consultant tomorrow to discuss George&#39;s post-mortem investigation results. I&#39;ve been trying to think of questions I have in advance in case things aren&#39;t covered in what he tells me. A lot will obviously be dependent on what he says about the investigations, but here&#39;s the list I have so far. Some are specific to my circumstances and others are more general questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I saw my GP around 2 weeks before his death for swollen and painful glands in my neck. The GP said it was probably just a virus or something (I wasn&#39;t feeling sick at all) - could this have been a sign of something?</p></li>
<li><p>The week leading to his death I felt really terrible. Run down/very exhausted/stressed/agitated and in a lot of pain with my hips and back. I know a lot of this is generally how you feel at 34 weeks pregnant. I told my midwife the day before he died I was feeling this way and she booked me in for physiotherapy, but otherwise nothing was said. Should I have asked to be checked out further?</p></li>
<li><p>At the midwife appointment the day before he died she asked if he&#39;d just been kicking. I said no, he hadn&#39;t. His heart rate was fast, but she just said that it was fine. Another midwife has since told me that he should have been monitored if they detected a high heart rate. Why didn&#39;t this happen?</p></li>
<li><p>In pregnancy it&#39;s generally advised you sleep on your left side. I have an old shoulder injury that prevented this so I slept mostly on my right side and sometimes my back. Could this have contributed to his death?</p></li>
<li><p>I was on medication from the start of pregnancy for HG. I was also put on medication in later pregnancy for reflux/heartburn. Could this have contributed?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve had discharge from my nipples for years and my test results came back normal (prolactin/thyroid function). My research suggests that this issue isn&#39;t a condition in itself, but a symptom of another problem. Some of these problems can significantly increase the risk of stillbirth. Should I be tested for additional problems prior to another pregnancy?</p></li>
<li><p>The midwife who delivered George commented that he was large for his gestational age. They believed he was going to be around 4lb and was just over 6lb at birth. It was mentioned in passing that gestational diabetes could have been a problem, despite my glucose test being negative. Is there any evidence of this in his results?</p></li>
<li><p>The midwife commented that his cord was extremely thick when he was born. It wasn&#39;t wrapped around him to suggest cord accident, but could this have been related to his death?</p></li>
<li><p>Was the cord and placenta normal?</p></li>
<li><p>The consultant at the hospital advised that I should have tests for clotting problems. When will these tests be undertaken?</p></li>
<li><p>What was tested for in the post-mortem? </p></li>
<li><p>Should I undergo any additional tests in any subsequent pregnancy?</p></li>
<li><p>What would be the plan for any future pregnancy?</p></li>
<li><p>Will I be considered high risk? Will I be induced early - if so, when?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the chances of this happening again?</p></li>
<li><p>What can I do to help prevent this happening again?</p></li>
<li><p>Will this affect my chances of conceiving? </p></li>
</ul>
