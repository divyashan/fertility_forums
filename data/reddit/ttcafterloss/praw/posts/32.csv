I feel like a downer posting in the alumni thread, but I have so appreciated your companionship and support over the past few months that I wanted to let you know that I'm going to be induced Saturday night to my baby boy. (Yes, it's a boy!)

I'm trying to see if the MFM will see me tomorrow (the one who told me I'm ""not high risk"" - eff you, sir) but I'm just so tired of trying to advocate for myself.

I'm not really at home in TTCAL since I'm not sure we'll ever be TTC again - two losses this late in one year is too much for anyone. I cannot imagine ever being pregnant again - it was a miserable four months of anxiety and fear - now I have to get through the muck of grief and heartache before I feel like myself again.

I can also not imagine never getting to have another baby - but I am incredibly lucky that I have my 2 miracles (with 4 losses now - including 2 after 20 weeks, I consider my boys the flukes, not the losses) and want to be able to be there for them instead of being a hot mess all the time.

I'm angry at my doctors for dismissing my fears. I'm heartbroken and unsure how anyone will ever be able to relate to me - I'm like a tale of tragedy that no one wants to hear about. I'm mourning the loss of another perfect baby.

I'm worried I'll be a bitter and angry person forever - having ended my fertility on another loss. I'm worried I'll be broken and wounded forever. I'm worried my anxiety about pregnancy coming true will make me more anxious about EVERYTHING.

Anyway, I'm rambling a lot, but I just wanted to thank you guys for your support and your kind messages. It was what got me through this pregnancy.

So I'll make it short, I purchased ovulation tests, the first day after I bought them, I decided to take one for the heck of it. My cycle is never regular so I had no idea when I actually am due to ovulate, even with recording data for 5 months. So when I took the test I was at my peak. I read the manual & everything just to make sure I knew. It said the next 48 hours were my most fertile days. (Nov 12th) so my fiance & I did everything that we read & tried our hardest!

Now, my last pregnancy, I had 4 false positive pregnancy tests before I found out that I was pregnant (11 weeks). So from that experience & what doctors have told me, I won't show up on a urine (my mom had the same problem) until my pregnancy hormones are ""high enough"" for me. So anyway, it says that the earliest I could take a test is now, in 6 days. I don't think I should even try it, knowing my history. I looked at my calender & figured it'd be safe just to test on the week of December 20th, I would be about 5 weeks along if we did conceive. & obviously if I have signs or symptoms, I plan to go to my doctor & request a blood test. 

So if anyone has ANY feedback, good, bad, anything that might be helpful, I would very much appreciate it.

There should be no standalone posts about pregnancies and no mention of pregnancies anywhere but the Alumni thread. We do this in order to keep this place a safe space for all who are dealing with the grief of a loss that is fresh.

The TTC thread is a very supportive and welcoming place for people who are working through the grief of their loss and either waiting to try again or beginning the process of trying again. It's a good place to ask questions about TTC and the particular difficulties of TTC again after loss, it's a great place to vent about things going on in your life, it's a great place to get support when you're struggling to conceive again. It's a great home for anyone who has experienced loss that is NOT currently pregnant. Pregnant members are welcome to comment in this thread but must leave all mention of current pregnancies out of this thread. 

The Alumni thread is very supportive and welcoming for questions about a current pregnancy, for vents and rants about pregnancy after loss, and for those who are currently pregnant but question whether or not they might be experiencing another loss. The Alumni thread is also the place to celebrate any pregnancy milestones when pregnant after loss. Basically, if you are pregnant after loss, the Alumni thread is a great home for you. TTC members are welcome to post and comment here as well to keep up with their friends, should they choose to.

Standalone posts are only for TTC and grief-related topics. This is a good place to link to articles or studies that may be interesting to our members, a place to post standalone rants, a place to post standalone TTC questions, and a place to give and receive support. There should be no standalone posts regarding pregnancies and no comments regarding pregnancy in this part of the sub either.

Lastly, if you are referring someone here from another sub, please make sure to let them know to post any pregnancy-related topics in the Alumni thread.

I know everyone here wants the same things - to end up with a baby in their arms after experiencing a loss - and we have members at many different stages of this journey. I know it isn't anyone's intent to trigger fellow members, but when the topics are so close to the heart it can and does happen. By following these rules we are striving to create a safe space for all of these members. Thank you everyone for your help, for your support for each other, and for being a nice corner of an internet that can be very dark at times.

Husband and I are 28 and I started TTC in September. We were successful on the first try. How awesome and lucky! My OB had me come in 3 times to check my betas as I had a little bit of spotting right after I got my BFP and they wanted to rule out an ectopic. I also got an early ultrasound at 5w3d. Everything was looking great! The following week my morning sickness started. Everything I read said this was a good sign. In retrospect, I call bullshit. I went in for another ultrasound at 7w5d where I was told there was no heartbeat and the fetus stopped developing around 6w. Right when my morning sickness started ramping up. I decided to give it another week before taking any action, mostly I think because I didn't want to believe what they were telling me, and also to see if my body would do its thing and miscarry naturally. No such luck. I had another ultrasound a week later which showed more of the same, but helped me accept that this baby was truly gone. I chose the misoprostol route, as the thought of a surgical procedure, no matter how minor, freaked me out. That weekend I was all ready with my super absorbent pads, strong pain meds, heating pad, husband and pets for moral support and cuddles. I ended up doing two doses over two days and not more than a few clots passed. Maybe the sac passed and I missed it? Nope, my body just can't do its freaking job. A week later at yet another ultrasound they told me that the sac was still in there and I needed to schedule a D&C. They gave me the option of general or local anesthesia. I chose local as they said I would be in and out faster. I made the wrong choice. [warning, a little graphic] This was the most traumatic thing I've ever experienced. I was very aware of what what happening and could hear and feel the suctioning. I'm pretty sure I was in a state of shock. If I ever find myself in this unfortunate situation again, I would definitely choose the general anesthesia.  

So here I am a week post D&C. Waiting in this limbo of suck. HPT was still positive this morning, though less intense than the control line now, so that's encouraging. I'm just mad that my body can't seem to do anything right. Couldn't grow a baby, couldn't pass the miscarriage on it's own. Couldn't even pass it with the help of meds.  

I should be 12 weeks pregnant this coming Friday. I should be getting ready to announce this joyful thing to friends and family. I should have been sporting a tiny bump at Christmas time. I had the cutest announcement planned. It was going to be Thanksgiving themed. I bought tiny little baby booties that look like turkeys. Dammit this sucks so hard. I just want my cycle to return so we can try again.  

On a positive note, at least I can drink to get through the holidays. Thanks for listening ladies. ",t2_12gkmc,False,,0,False,Intro.

She&#39;s also doing some testing (I know a bunch of bloodworm that I go in for today, not sure what else she recommends right now). 
So my dilema... we all know there is no higher risk if mc if you conceive before your first period. I obviously conceive pretty easily, so if I could just hang on to the damn thing I&#39;d be ok!  So.... do I try this month and say fuck it, or wait until the testing is done and protect until next month? Mentally the second pregnancy never felt right so I&#39;m not mourning right now (like symptoms disappeared 2d after the faint positive hpt) 
Like I said fully aware we&#39;re taking weeks here and it&#39;s not important, but since I&#39;ve spent a hour debating this am..... thoughts ladies? </p>

20,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi there-

I am curious if anyone out there has experience with low progesterone. I had mine drawn Tuesday, before I started miscarrying/bleeding (that's still TBD, awaiting more bloodwork), and my level was 0.3 ng/mL. I asked my OB if perhaps this failed pregnancy was due to a progesterone issue. She said she really doubted it, and I shouldn't worry about it and we'll just see what happens next time. I did mention my luteal phase is short - 8 or 9 days, and she didn't seem to think that meant anything.


I guess I'm just wondering if there is a case for repeat progesterone testing in a few weeks, to see if its gone up to a more normal level for being mid-cycle? I think if I asked her to put an order in, she would probably do it, but I wanted to get some feedback from you all. Of course, if it ends up this pregnancy is ectopic, then the low progesterone level would make a lot more sense.


Thanks in advance!

This morning I found out it is looking very likely I have another ectopic pregnancy. I had one in June of this year as well. Feeling super fucking defeated right now. After the first ectopic, I made so many changes. I tossed all my plastic containers and switched to glass. I changed all my household cleaning products to one without harsh chemicals. I cut back on my drinking significantly. I didn't drink at all for 4 weeks before we started trying. I cut back on my meat consumption. I was eating mostly a plant-based diet. I cut back on coffee consumption. I started taking CoQ10. I took Tumeric supplements for inflammation. I started exercising regularly. 

And I get the same fucking outcome as last time. I am so disheartened and depressed.

Edit: I also changed my job to a way less stressful one, and I get a lot more sleep too! Whyyyy

Edit 2: Well, good news-ish. My HCG dropped from 38 to 23. So I might have a ""normal"" miscarriage after all.

<p>This morning I found out it is looking very likely I have another ectopic pregnancy. I had one in June of this year as well. Feeling super fucking defeated right now. After the first ectopic, I made so many changes. I tossed all my plastic containers and switched to glass. I changed all my household cleaning products to one without harsh chemicals. I cut back on my drinking significantly. I didn&#39;t drink at all for 4 weeks before we started trying. I cut back on my meat consumption. I was eating mostly a plant-based diet. I cut back on coffee consumption. I started taking CoQ10. I took Tumeric supplements for inflammation. I started exercising regularly. </p>

<p>And I get the same fucking outcome as last time. I am so disheartened and depressed.</p>

<p>Edit: I also changed my job to a way less stressful one, and I get a lot more sleep too! Whyyyy</p>

<p>Edit 2: Well, good news-ish. My HCG dropped from 38 to 23. So I might have a &quot;normal&quot; miscarriage after all. The doctor said I won&#39;t be out of the woods in terms of ectopic until my HCG is down to less than 5. Fingers crossed!</p>

My partner and I have wanted a baby for a little while. We've been together 10 years. I'm 30. This was the right time for several reasons including mat leave benefits, new job, new province, etc. Took a couple of cycles with OPKs and then, great, was pregnant. Told some close friends. I didn't tell my family - I wanted to do it in person and I'd just moved. My best friend from med school got pregnant a month before I did. We were going to do mat leave together. 

I'm in more of a regional centre with longer wait times for ultrasound. I didn't have my dating and viability U/S scheduled until 12w6d. At the time, I was like 'well that's probably fine, but I'd love confirmation of a single, live, intrauterine gestation'. I had decided that this pregnancy was going to be totes normal - which, now in retrospect is RIDICULOUS to ASSUME. Especially in my case, since as an MD, I provide maternity care, including to lots of women who have miscarriages, and other losses. Anyway, 10wk5d rolls around and I'm having spotting, cramping, and I've realized that I'm no longer tired. I have tons of energy. Shit. We went to the ER where I work once/week, and my colleague examined me in the exact same room where I do gyne exams. She uses the same ultrasound I use on patients. My nursing friends come to see what's up. Zero confidentiality, but everyone is super nice. She was like 'maybe you're off on your dates by 5 weeks', there's something in the uterus, maybe even with a heartbeat... My partner was optimistic, but I knew that moment. Still next day I went to get the 'real' u/s emergently, and nope, no baby. Just a weird septated fluid. ?molar pregnancy? I did serial betas, they dropped, another colleague prescribes me misoprostol, I end up back in the ER for pain and dehydration. Genetic testing reveals no molar. It took probably 3 weeks for my bHCGs to go back to zero. I took two days off work. And now I deal. 

I deal with so many daily triggers. Pregnant women! Delivering babies! Delivering babies at 3am when my resiliency is low! C-sections! Couples with infertility. Pregnant friends. And then so many people seemed surprised that I was pregnant on purpose. So many people asked 'was this a planned pregnancy?' Yes, I literally put in IUDs for a living (and I do a few other things!!!), but I have no idea how to control my own fertility. But also! Even if it wasn't planned its definitely not the business of randos who know me through work. 

This experience has changed me. When I got my misoprostol, the pharmacist (not the technician mind you, an actual pharmacist) asked me if I still needed the diclectin. Engraged and shocked, I was like 'listen to what you're saying. Think about it. You will never, ever, take those at the same time! Be a better professional!'. (Berating people in public is not typically part of my ambience...!)

We're now trying again, its time for AF cycle 2 post MC. I'm 14dpo with no start, and no positive test, so body is a trololol. 

TL:DR? Trusting the medical system is hard, even when you are part of it. What we all go through is hell, and I'm sorry you've all been there. So hello. I've been silent, but I'm here too.

You don't always get the empathy and respect you deserve, and thus the necessity of groups like this. Thank you for sharing. It normalized and legitimized my feelings for me and helped me realize that they were valid. I'm going to see my pregnant best friend from med school this week.

I only stayed for about 5 hours after talking to the staff there and reorienting myself to an okay state of mind. They let me go home with an outpatient appointment next week. After talking to them several more times they suggested that rather than relapsing into my depression/anxiety disorder that the Mirena crash was to blame. 

I called my obgyn and asked if there was any way I could just have a severe hormonal imbalance which would also explain why I haven't had a period yet. They said it's not unheard of but that a progesterone supplement would only prolong the imbalance. They recommended I see a nutritionist so I can adjust my diet to include foods and vitamins that will signal my body to start producing progesterone. 

I took a night off work so I've had a long weekend so far and have gotten lots of rest and stayed in a positive mindset. It was pretty embarrassing all around but I'm glad to be doing something about it now and looking forward to starting that first cycle. 

Just wanted to say thanks to those who commented and remind everyone to ask for help when you need it. Don't isolate yourself. Take care of yourself and use the support available to you.

I'm incantationkidnapper - 28F, been married since March and with my partner for 6.5 years. In July we decided to finally start TTC!

A week ago I got my first BFP ever on cycle 4. I was so excited, but also very nervous. I tested early because I was going away for a few days (combining a work trip with seeing friends) and knew there would be some events with alcohol. I diligently diverted all offers for glasses of wine or going out too late and think I managed to avoid raising too much suspicion. 

I tested a couple times throughout the week and didn't notice the line getting any darker but put this off to testing with internet cheapies. On Saturday I bought a clear blue digital and received a pregnant 1-2 weeks with FMU on Sunday. I saved the test so I could show DH when I got home Tuesday. On Monday afternoon the test no longer showed the results and by the evening I started to notice some brown spotting. Something in me knew this wasn't a good sign. The cramps I had been experiencing changed to become more like period cramps. 

Tuesday I woke up and I was bleeding. I knew it was the end but I tried to convince myself it would be ok. I took another clear blue digital and it gave me the same results as before. The most squinty line came up on the internet cheapie. I had to go buy pads. I still had another day of work plus a flight to get through before I got home. 

I broke down on the plane. Before takeoff I texted DH that I needed him to meet me when I landed (he had dinner plans). Then I had to turn my phone off. I didn't know if he received the text. I silently cried throughout the flight, trying to distract myself by listening to music and reading the inflight magazine. I was only pregnant for a week; why does this hurt so bad? What did I do wrong? I know it isn't my fault and it is normal to grieve after a loss, but damn, why is the world so cruel?

The plane landed and I turned off airplane mode. My battery died. I still had no idea if DH was going to meet me. I got through immigration and picked up my suitcase from baggage claim. DH was there! He held me and assured me it would be ok. That these things happen. That we will have a baby one day. It isn't the end of the world and we will get through it together. We will keep trying. I am very thankful to have him. 

Today is slightly better. I am sad to not have my July baby but I am hopeful for the future.

First post, but I've been lurking this sub for a while, and I can't tell you how helpful its been reading all of your posts. Sorry for the length, need to get some things off my chest. 

I had a missed miscarriage, and medically miscarried in September. My baby had stopped developing a month before I found out, and its been difficult dealing with the fact that I felt and thought I was pregnant for a month, when I actually wasn't. It feels like such a cruel, sick deception. Anyone else experienced this? 

I was very depressed and anxious afterwards, but I've been doing better lately. My SO and I are finally able to try again, and I'm cautiously optimistic. The thing I've really been struggling with lately are my relationships with family members. I went through all of this alone and didn't feel any support from the people I expected it from. When I found out I was pregnant, everyone was so excited and called and messaged me. After the miscarriage, the worst thing I've ever been through, I didn't really hear much from anybody. It hurt so much. I tried opening up to my mom about what I was going through, and thought she was being supportive. But when she came to visit me (I was excited to have someone to finally unload all my thoughts onto) she spent the whole time talking about herself, and telling me all the people she had told about MY miscarriage (people I don't even know) and how they were sad for HER. I was furious and just wanted her to leave.

My aunt, who I am very close with, sent me one text message after, and that's it. My SO and I decided to get married recently and had a super small and quick ceremony one day, and I got an angry call from my aunt asking why I hadn't told her about it. I just wanted to scream at her, ""why the fuck would I call you about that when you didn't even call me after my baby died!"" Also, after we got married (we are very private people and didn't want a giant wedding or anything like that), the congratulatory messages from family started pouring in. I couldn't believe it. They were making such a giant deal about it, when I had barely heard anything from them after I miscarried. 

And yesterday I was talking to my mom about how we are TTC, and she kept saying things like ""Let's be honest, you're not going to get pregnant for a while. There's no way."" And she kept making comments making it sound like she looks down on people who have to ""try"" to get pregnant, and how she didn't have to try at all. 

I honestly feel like my relationships with these people will never be the same. I feel so angry with them. At first I made excuses for them like, ""oh it's okay, people don't really know what to say"". But I'm realizing this is bullshit. They are my FAMILY. 

This is the loneliest most isolating thing I have ever been through, and I feel permanently changed. Rant over! Anyone else have similar struggles with their relationships?

I still feel hurt that after my first loss she refused to adjust travel plans and drive a couple hours to be with us instead of the other way around when I was physically unable to travel after my D&C.

Then the only thing she said about it was this January (9 months after my first MC), was that she was thinking of us ""during that time."" She couldn't even say it, and it didn't register that nothing was better.

I talked to her day and night that it wasn't her fault.

So this turned out to be a rant of everything that has been going on in my head for the last couple of hours.. 

Today its exactly a year ago I got my BFP, little did I know everything would go to hell just 2 days later. I was 6 weeks pregnant and only got to enjoy that for 2 whole days. Then the bleeding started, and it didn't stop for 4,5 weeks. Only then did the doctors find out it was an ectopic and I had to have emergency surgery. 

A year since this roller coaster of emotions journey began. Our first year of marriage was supposed to look so different. It wasn't supposed to go like this. These things don't happen to us, they happen to other people. I was 1 in 100 women who get an ectopic pregnancy. I almost died little less than a year ago. We lost our baby. A baby that would've been over 3 months old right now. I lost my right tube in the process. They told me there was a lot of scarring in there which caused the ectopic. They couldn't tell me how it got there in the first place. 

My husband almost lost me and lost our baby after only a month of marriage.

Never would we have dreamed I would be pregnant right now. 

Never would we have dreamed that we would conceive only 4 months after everything happened. 

Never would we have a carefree pregnancy after everything that happened. 

Today I am going to eat a lot of chocolate while crying my eyeballs out and enjoying every second of that little girl moving around inside me. 

Little girl; you are so welcome and we cannot wait to see you. You already have a beautiful sister watching over you.

I had a chemical pregnancy on my third cycle trying (in september). I only knew I was pregnant for a few days but I found the experience very traumatic and am still struggling. I miss it so much. I also suffer from bipolar disorder II which doesn't help! 

My husband and I have decided to continue trying straight away and I am currently 8dpo but I have a question I'm hoping you ladies who have had multiple pregnancies can help me with.

Did you experience similar symptoms for each pregnancies? For instance, on the cycle that I conceived I had implantation bleeding on 7dpo. Should I expect bleeding for my next pregnancy? I haven't had any yet.

Thanks in advance for your advice!
