We tried right away and I honestly believed I would get pregnant right away. I had a loss during my first ever pregnancy at 12 weeks but became pregnant without even trying 6 months after. I became pregnant with my second child while on the depo shot and while breastfeeding. He was an oops baby for sure. My third I got pregnant on the second month of trying. With my last pregnancy 2nd month as well. 

So here’s my concern. Since my miscarriage I have had lighter and lighter periods. First two months were heavy as all hell. But afterwards each period has become significantly lighter to were all I need is a Pantiliner after day 2. This isn’t typical for me at all. My periods were always heavy and lasted 5 days. Now they run 3-5 depending on the cycle. I also have been suffering with painful cramps everymonth (haven’t had this since I was a teen) and bad cystic acne. 

I’m ovulating and checking with tests monthly. We are both active all around fertility days. I eat well. Nothing drastic in lifestyle. So now I’m getting concerned I may have adhesions from my D and C. 

My sister has gone through years of infertility and gave me advice to pretty much lie about my concerns to be taken seriously. She said that I should tell my OB that I’m getting my endometriosis back (dr suspected Ihad it when I was 16). She said this way it would ensure they don’t dismiss me and do an ultrasound. I personally want to just tell the OB “hey I think my surgery may have caused scarring”. 

She also told me I should omit that I had faint positives in December and January. I truly believed I was pregnant but then they became lighter to negatives.

Luckily I just noticed from wiping, nothing hit my underwear yet, but it was quite a bit again. Is this off and on a period? Is that something common for a first cycle? Any insight on this?</p>

It's been nearly a month (less two days) since one of the worst days of my life. I was almost 19 weeks into a much wanted pregnancy. I was finally starting to breathe and relax. It's been a rollercoaster for the last 7 years. In 2012, my then boyfriend, now husband was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer at 26 years old. We were fortunate to have saved his ""stuff"" ahead of him starting a year (!) of chemotherapy. Fast forward 5 years, he's relatively healthy (and cancer free!) and I'm in the final phases of my PhD. We're finally feeling ready to start our family. I've known since his diagnosis that our path to a family would involve IVF. We (mainly I) underwent the whole IVF process in November 2018. We couldn't transfer an embryo immediately as I had OHSS (a side effect of IVF). We decided to postpone until the new year and on January 22, 2019 we transferred one 5 day embryo. 

&#x200B;

I've always been acutely aware of the success statistics associated with IVF. Fortunately, we received a positive on our first transfer. We were excited but extremely cautious. We held off telling many people including close family until after I had passed the 12-week mark and received normal results on my NIPT. I remember scheduling my anatomy scan-feeling the anticipation of seeing the baby again. Feeling more confident that I would finally be a parent. Feeling excited that I was starting to show and we could begin to gather things for the room.

&#x200B;

I went for my anatomy scan at 18+4. Thought it went well at the time. Received a phone call that evening from my GP stating that there was a congenital anomaly seen on ultrasound. Literally felt my world crumble. In the next few days, we were faced with one of the most decisions either of us would need to make. We chose to end the pregnancy-we felt that we couldn't be certain about the prognosis, and felt bound by time as I was approaching 20 weeks.

&#x200B;

I had the procedure 2-3 (over 2 days) after we received word of the anomaly. My memories of that week are hazy-part self-protective and partly drug-induced (prescribed)-for this I feel fortunate). Now, a month on, I am still struggling. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes I feel like the entire pregnancy was another lifetime ago- a sort of dream. I feel so lucky to have great support in my husband and parents. I have a great circle of friends that have been incredibly kind. They send me texts (and phone calls) on a daily basis. The problem is, outside of my parents and husband, I can't bring myself to speak with anyone. I find it difficult even picking up the phone-I am almost scared of feeling pity. How do I get past this? 

&#x200B;

I also cycle between feeling sad and incredibly angry. I hate the person that I am becoming. I don't want to feel jealous or angry, but I just can't seem to stop myself. I so apologize for the wall of text. I am hoping someone will have some words of wisdom to share with me. I'm worried that I will never be happy again. I know that sounds extreme, but I feel that a part of me has died.

 When the triage nurse asked me what brought me in, I couldn’t believe the words coming out of my mouth. “I think I’m having a miscarriage?” “Pardon? I couldn’t hear you.” (Louder this time so anyone within 10 feet can hear me) “I think I’m having a miscarriage” 

I waited a while. I gave a few vials of blood. An hour later the emerge doctor tells me I was pregnant... Am likely no longer pregnant. Sheer panic, instant tears, confusion and frustration with myself. A text to my boyfriend. “Miscarriage”. I don’t hear the next 3 minutes of what the doctor asks me. She looks at the remains in the ziplock baggy and starts separating it, examining closely. Leaves the room with it.  I comprehend “everything from the wast down”. I assume this means take my clothes off and prepare for an ultrasound image.  Seconds later, ultrasound 1 of  3 taken that night. 

2 more ultrasounds, more bloodwork. It’s determined everything has naturally aborted itself and I was 6 weeks along. 

I like to think I know myself well enough and not to blame myself. But the last 7 weeks of not knowing I was pregnant included antibiotics and a cough syrup containing low dose opioid, a chest X-ray both to confirm I didn’t have pneumonia, 2 alcoholic drinks at a concert (I never drink)  my birth control which I take every 24 hrs on the hour, vigorous workouts, starting an incredible new career, and occasional use of recreational marijuana. Fairly healthy eating during the day and the occasional.. frequent pig out. 


I know ... I’m not supposed to blame myself but all of these things that could be my fault.

^ The hcg and Lh tests I took today. 

I miscarried at 12 weeks last Sunday. When I left the hospital my hCG levels were around 2600, so I assume the baby stopped growing awhile ago. I’m going in for a blood test a couple days to make sure my hCG levels are dropping, but I decided to see if anything would show up on home test today. 

The line was very barely visible on the pregnancy test. IIRC this is about what my test looked like when I was about 10 DPO, so I know my hCG is really low but its still in my system. 

I also dipped an LH strip just because I was curious and it’s pretty close to a positive test. The doctor said I could ovulate again as soon as 1 to 2 weeks after the miscarriage. (We’re still going to wait for my period to come before we try again.)

We are a same sex couple so we do have a donor from a bank. We finally conceived on our first IUI back in February. 

Things took a turn for the worst and our nightmare we are living in is horrible. Losing our son at 19 weeks due to IC and ruptured members/water breaking was the most traumatic experience in my life. I’m sure everyone reading this can relate to my pain and I’m glad to have this subreddit because my wife and I would like to try again once I’m fully recovered. I don’t know if I could go back to lurking on other pregnancy related subreddits. 

Thinking about trying again has given me hope for the future. I am mourning extremely hard over my son, Blake. He was beautiful. I wasn’t expecting to deliver such a beautiful baby at 19 weeks. He passed before being delivered so we just held him and admired him for a little awhile. 

This really hurts. Luckily I’m not in physical pain and delivery wise, everything went as smooth as possible under the circumstances. 

I was told for the next pregnancy, I would be given a cerclage and would be monitored closer. I’m glad there are preventable measures. I’m worried about the TTC process taking awhile, I’m worried about the next pregnancy being high risk/high anxiety. 

I sometimes worry I am doomed to never have a take home baby. I worry about trying again so soon and it looking like I’m forgetting about Blake. 

As you can tell, my feelings are all over the place. My wife and I have had some happy moments here and there but the rollercoaster of grief is still difficult. The smallest things trigger us. We plan on seeing a grief counselor who specializes in this.

Left our ultrasound two weeks ago over the moon when the tech accidentally let it slip it was a boy. We got to see his cute little face and watch him yawn and wiggle on the screen. The car ride home was filled with us excitedly talking about names and sports he would play and planning our future. 

About two hours after the appointment I received a call from my doctor. She let us know that there were serious issues with the baby and we needed further testing. We went for a second ultrasound and genetic counselling a week later, and they confirmed our worst fears. They said that there was most likely a genetic condition. The baby’s condition was not compatible with  life, and he would pass away shortly after birth or before then. We opted to end the pregnancy, and save our baby from suffering. These have been the hardest and most heartbreaking two weeks of my life.

Seeing how excited my husband was when I told him I was pregnant, to how crushed and heartbroken when I told him the baby was sick was the worst. He has been so strong and there for me, but I know he is grieving.

The waiting for appointments and a room in the hospital was a struggle and the induction process was long and uncomfortable, but the nurses and doctors were  great.

We had our sweet beautiful angel baby after 15 hours. He was so peaceful looking and we were lucky enough the get to hold him and nap with him for some time. We didn’t think we wanted to see him as it would be too hard, but it gave us a chance to say hello and goodbye and kiss our baby for the first and last time. I regret not holding him longer or hugging him tighter or taking a picture of his sweet little face and chubby cheeks. Although we only got to hold him for a short while, he will forever be in our hearts. I treasure the keepsakes the hospital gave us (the hat he wore, blanket he was wrapped in, footprints).

During the process I was so sure I never wanted to go through this again, but after seeing his cute little face, I realized that I would do anything to bring a life into this world and start a family with my husband. 

It gives me hope, and this little angel has already had so much impact on our lives with bringing my husband and I closer together. He has taught me to hold the ones I love close and be patient and forgiving. We are in no rush to try again until we know the results from our genetic testing, but are hopeful and healing. Our little boy will help identify possible problems with future pregnancies for us and possibly our siblings. His time on this earth will not be for nothing, and he has and will teach us so much.

Hi all,

Back story: Been trying to conceive since the last 18 months and had 3 pregnancy losses in that time. No cause found. Doctor said its pure bad luck, keep trying.

I got diagnosed with psoriasis in 2017, a coin sized patch on my scalp. The dermatologist gave me a steroid spray which really helped control it. Fast forward 2018, 6 weeks pregnant and my psoriasis flared up like crazy and every joint in my body started to hurt. Ignored the joint pains, thinking its my body being weird with the pregnancy hormones. Then I went on to have a miscarriage at 9 weeks.

At present, my joint pain has been getting more and more persistent and now I could not ignore it. I met a dermatologist today and she suspects its psoriatic arthritis. She has referred me to a rheumatologist and I'm still waiting to get an appointment there. Uggh!

Now I'm wondering that since this seems to be an immunological issue, could it also have played a role in my losses?

Anyone with similar experiences?

A (long) vent...  I am incredibly fortunate to have a supportive partner, but two losses back to back have wrecked me. He's trying hard to keep my chin-up, and keep me positive but in all honesty, he has no idea what I'm feeling and I don't know how to let him in. I was diagnosed with depression years ago, have been on medication but had stopped taking it becasue I was trying to be as clean and healthy a vessel as possible for pregnancy. Fast forward, despite my best efforts, only losses. 

I'm told that stress can negatively effect pregnancy and even cause miscarriages. Noticing my behavior, I'm definitely not handling things as well as I did on my medicine so I plan to get back on a regime before we try again. Could it be that my mental state is impacting my pregnancies?  The issue here is I already feel inadequate for needing medication to be a normal person. Pile on my body saying ""No!"" to my pregnancy attempts and it compounds my feelings of failure. Of self-loathing, pain, sadness, jealousy, fear...all the crap I'm trying to eschew. 

Lastly, I'm 37yo and already feeling pressure that I've waited too long and the longer it takes the harder everything will become and it terrifies me!

I realized halfway through the classes that the instructor wasn't demonstrating the poses because she was pregnant, in her second trimester.  I finished the classes out because I really liked her instructing, then switched to a new class.  The first class was tonight, where I found out the new instructor is also pregnant in her second trimester.  Except this one gushes about how happy she and her husband are to all the older ladies in class, who are so excited to give advice and congratulate her.

So I wanted to introduce myself and maybe vent, I don’t know.


I’ve been lurking on this sub since my MMC, debating on posting because I know the moment I type it all out my problems, all of the thoughts that have been plaguing me for months since this happened, all of the anxiety related to not seeing a positive pregnancy test each month—everything becomes REAL. 

For background, I got pregnant (first one) and everything was sunshine and rainbows until it wasn’t. I was in and out of my OBGYN office each week until the 9 week mark getting ultrasounds because “you may have a rare type of ectopic pregnancy” “we need to watch the growth.” And then at 7ish weeks there was a heartbeat. An actual heartbeat. And two weeks later there wasn’t. It all happened so fast—I really didn’t have time to process any of it. We were so excited at the prospect of having a little one. And my body couldn’t even do its job, I had to have two surgeries back to back to remove it...which was some bullshit, but that’s another story for another time. 

Since then my mentality hasn’t been the same. I’ve been so pessimistic about babies and getting pregnant and everything. I can’t be happy for other women, friends with babies...nothing. And every month I get my period despite consistent “trying”.  I was diagnosed with PCOS in my 20’s, my uterus has a septum in it and I can’t get any good answers to why I miscarried or anything. 

I see my OBGYN this Friday for an ultrasound due to a fun new symptom/problem that has come up. I began bleeding after sex one night over a week ago and figured it was that time of the month again...I passed two clots later but then next day: nothing. No cramps. No bleeding. Then last Thursday the same thing happened. I was sure it was my cycle, but a few cramps and no real bleeding and it was gone. Except every day since then I’ve had off and on light pink spotting when I wipe (sorry, TMI?) and what appears to be tiny pieces of tissue (uterine tissue? Idk) in the toilet. And I’m cramping steadily and lightly. No positive tests and I’ve taken what I consider to be plenty of them.

Content warning: pregnancy loss

In the beginning of February, we experienced a miscarriage. It happen very quickly, we had only known for a week before the miscarriage happen. This was incredibly difficult for me to process and I entered therapy. I finally felt like I was in a good place emotionally. My partner didn't take this too hard to my knowledge, but it also caused us some distance in our relationship. About mid-May, we found out that I was pregnant again. It took us totally by surprise. At my first prenatal appointment, the midwife was unable to locate the fetal pole and suggested I come back in two weeks. These two weeks were awful and yesterday was my follow up appointment. At the follow up, we were told that the baby had stopped growing and not viable. We were given options: allowing my body to process normally (which seemed unlikely in a timely fashion, as nothing had been happening), medical management, or surgical management. I had opted for medical management and went through that process yesterday. My partner seems to be taking this a lot harder this time. While I'm upset, I'm unsurprised that this was the outcome. 

Overall, I'm feeling very frustrated with my body and struggling to understand why this hasn't been working out for me and my partner. I have another appointment in two weeks to confirm that all the tissue has left my body, but they said they'd also do some testing for me. I don't have any idea what could be causing this issue (if anything), and it's making me crazy trying to solve it. I'm also just feeling overall discouraged from the outcomes and don't want to try again, at least this year. There are so many good things happening this year (I'm finishing my bachelor's degree in December!) and I was excited to see our child as part if the good coming at the end of the year. It makes me wonder if I can handle doing this over and over again, if kids are even an option for us.

So, story time.

My husband and I started trying for our first last month.  We were unicorns, and we found out the day of my missed period.  For a week, I had increasing pregnancy symptoms (mainly increase in sense of smell and nausea).  I was so excited to be pregnant so quickly.  We started trying in May largely for sentimental reasons, even though we thought that July made better sense timing wise.  We were on an international trip, and I knew that I'd find out if I was pregnant while we were in Paris.  France was my Grandfather's favorite country and Paris was his favorite city.  I was always very close with him, and both of our potential children's names are tied to him in some way.  Not only that, but the due date of this pregnancy would have been within a week of his birthday.  My husband and I both thought it was meant to be, I even said that I'd be less worried about miscarrying if I ended up getting pregnant this cycle, because it just felt so right.  I very much regret thinking and saying that now.

My test progression wasn't what I thought it should be and my tests never got very pink.  I started bright red spotting on 20dpo.  I called my doc, they had me come in for betas and an ultrasound.  My betas were very low, only 38.  They saw nothing on the ultrasound (of course, my HCG was so low they didn't expect to), just a thickening of my uterine lining. They sent me on my way and scheduled follow up betas.  I started bleeding heavy, so they had me come in again for another blood draw and pelvic exam.  At this point, my betas were still 38 and I was bleeding a lot, so they told me that I was definitely having a miscarriage.  They sent me home, told me what to expect and scheduled a follow-up blood draw for yesterday.

Yesterday rolls around and I did my blood test. I wasn't concerned because I clearly miscarried - or so I thought.  I had been bleeding for 6 days at this point. They got the results and told me that my HCG levels actually increased to 61.  This would be a 5 day doubling time, so definitely not viable regardless of implantation location.  However, the fact that they're increasing so slowly and I bled for so long makes both me, and my doctor, believe I'm having an ectopic pregnancy.

They're having me come in again today to meet with the doctor and have another ultrasound.  My HCG is so low that they don't expect to see anything regardless... I'm trying not to freak out, but having an ectopic pregnancy was always my worst fear.  I had just come to terms with the fact that I'd lost this pregnancy and now I'm still in this state of limbo.

If anyone has dealt with anything similar, I'd love to hear your experience.  I'm hoping that they'll just give me a Methotrexate shot and that my HCG will drop super quick because it's so low anyways.  However, I have this fear that they're going to want to wait and see if they can confirm that it's ectopic before doing so... Either way, I'm so glad that I have an amazing doctor who has been monitoring me super closely and taking everything so seriously.  I feel blessed in that regard.

Moving forward, I have no idea what the hell to do.  I know that I don't have to know right now, but I can't help but have it on my mind.  My husband and I always said that if I miscarried we would only wait as long as the doctor recommended.  However, with this likely being ectopic I'm petrified of going through it all again, especially with increased chances of it being ectopic in the future.

The first time I got pregnant we weren't trying. It was a surprise and gave us a healthy boy. The second time we were like ""let's start having unprotected sex and see what happens"" not temping or monitoring ovulation. Got pregnant the first cycle but ended in a MMC at 10 weeks.   


We are now onto cycle #3 after the MC and nothing. Nothing. I've been temping and peeing on OPKs and doing all the tracking you can do. And nothing. And it's crushing me.   


I also bought into ""the first 3 cycles after a MC you are super fertile and will get pregnant easily"" which has not been the case for us and it makes it all even harder to deal with.

I'm so, so tired of getting these comments at my work.

I have worked in a veterinary clinic for the better part of a decade, and as such clients have become familiar enough with me to feel like they can comment on my life.

My coworker (and beloved best friend) has been at the office for 4-5 years, and is also 9 months pregnant.

I gained a decent amount of weight within the past 1-2 years, though I'm tall, carry mostly in my hips, and don't have a large belly, and have had **4** clients come out and ask me if I'm pregnant since my friend's pregnancy has become obvious.

Now, within the last 4 weeks, or so, **everyone** seems to be making comments like those listed in my title with increasing frequency. I've ranged in responses from ""heh, not right now"" to awkward laughter to just ignoring them. Usually, though, they respond by saying, ""Ha! I guess you don't want kids then, huh?"" One client responded this way *after* I told her that I would prefer not to discuss the topic with her when she said that my coworker beat me and it's my turn, now. I told her it was a sensitive subject for me and she said, ""Oh, ha! Sorry!"" What is wrong with people?! 

Every time someone says these things (which is multiple times a day.. It's ridiculous), I'm just reminded of the fact that I *should* be pregnant. That I'm supposed to be 5 months into my own pregnancy, right now. I'm just trying to move on, but every damn day people keep reminding me that I don't have the thing I would kill to still have, and then they laugh about it like it's a joke.

I found out at my 8 week ultrasound on Friday that there was no heartbeat (after seeing one at 6 weeks).  My doctor scheduled me for a D&C to happen tomorrow.  He recommended doing genetic testing as this is my second MMC.  The first one, last November, was a blighted ovum.  

I was told that they use Natera Anora kits for genetic testing and that it was my responsibility to contact Natera to determine costs and insurance coverage.  Natera was very hard to get in touch with but they told me that they are out-of-network for my insurance and the out of pocket expense was $799 if insurance did not cover it.  My insurance company confirmed they were out of network but stated the testing would be covered if my doctor provided precertification.  My doctor's office was huffy about this and said they never had to provide precertification but nevertheless called my insurance company to authorize it and were informed that a panel would have to determine whether or not to cover the testing and they would make a decision in 2-5 business days.  Ridiculous.

I don't want to delay the D&C for many reasons but I obviously won't have a concrete answer about whether this testing is covered before the procedure tomorrow morning.  My question is this:  is the testing even worth it?  My understanding is that the majority of miscarriages are due to chromosomal errors that aren't likely to be repeated with future pregnancies.  And there is the risk that the test may be inconclusive.  So if the test doesn't provide me with much useful information for a future pregnancy, why get the testing?  I have a healthy 2 year old daughter so I doubt the testing would reveal anything catastrophic.

Weird to say that I hope people here have some experience with this because I wish it on no one, but some support would be appreciated:

A few weeks ago I posted about our 18 week anatomy scan and how there were a few concerning findings. We did an amnio but were told it didn’t look like a genetic issue and basically just to wait the three weeks to see the follow up scan. The karyotype testing all did come back normal and at our 21 week scan our baby’s brain looked totally normal - the choroid plexus cysts were gone and the entire cerebellum was seen. Baby’s kidneys had duplicating collecting systems but the MFM said it’s basically meaningless with a slight chance of UTIs. 

That same day we got insurance pre-approval for the microarray portion of the amnio. I was actually hesitant to do it because I worried about getting a result of unknown significance that would stress us out. But my husband wanted it and the genetic counselor said since they already had the sample and there is a kidney abnormality, it was worth it. 

Ten days later, after we finally relaxed back into pregnancy and all but forgot about the impending results, the genetic counselor called. Over the phone she explained that there was a large deletion and went over some basics and suggested I come in with my husband. I knew then and there that it was over. I made him come home immediately and sobbed as I told him the news. At our appointment two hours later, the genetic counselor explained how many genes were affected by a deletion of this size and also informed us that it’s extremely rare - she was only able to find ten similar cases. My husband and I knew immediately we would terminate. We cried. 

At our hospital these late D&Es are only done on Fridays, so we had to wait a week, though they started treating my cervix on Wednesday. So this past Friday, at 23+4, our pregnancy ended. We were previously not finding our baby’s gender but learned from the amnio report she was a girl. We named her Skylar. 

We’re devastated and pretty lost. Physically I’m uncomfortable, particularly now that my breasts are engorged (anyone have any tips on dealing with this?). But emotionally we basically live in a loop of crying/being devastated, managing to distract ourselves, then remembering and being sad all over again. Truly don’t know how to handle grief like this. Hoping to get us in to see a counselor soon because I’m at a loss of how to get us both through this. 

I spoke to my RE and he said generally between waiting for HCG to go down and wanting to check for scarring, it would be 2-3 months before we could get back to trying. We will be tested to make sure this was a fluke and not something we have and were told it almost certainly is, though so far we’ve managed to be unlucky in every way so not sure how much comfort to take from that.

When I got pregnant we were just off contraception and held the attitude of ""we won't TRY but if it happens it happens"". Lo and behold I fell pregnant right away.

It was a bit of a shock but we were honestly thrilled and I quickly realised it's exactly what I wanted. 

Now it's been a few weeks since the miscarriage I'm just not getting over it. I feel robbed. I want my baby back and feel desperate to be pregnant again.

I told my husband I didn't feel I'd be happy again until I was pregnant and bringing home a healthy full term baby.

He was happy for us to get right into ttc but I fear I've gone a bit too far.

I'm taking ovulation tests twice a day. I'm jumping on my husband at least daily and I'm struggling to just take a chill pill with it all.

He's now not able to ejaculate when we have sex cause he knows I'm not really doing it cause I want to, just cause I want to get pregnant again. He says it's too much pressure on him and he doesn't want to sleep with me when he knows I'm not really lusting after him.

I feel terrible. I don't want to make him feel this way. I live my husband but our usual routine is probably only once a week or even once a fortnight which has always suited us just fine. I'm starting to get a lot of pain from all the activity but just scared I'm gonna miss my window to get pregnant again.

My father has just been diagnosed with liver failure and potentially liver cancer and I've struggled with starting a new and extremely stressful job. And then the miscarriage. 

I just want something good to happen. I was so happy about being pregnant. I thought my luck had turned around until I lost it. I feel like life is shitting on me and I've lost all control.

I know I'm being very over the top with trying to conceive again and my husband is being very supportive and understanding.

I miscarried naturally at 7+3 days at the beginning of May.  Trying to understand how my body will readjust after the miscarriage, I logged it as CD1 and started to record my bbt again. 


Temperature-wise, it is astonishing obvious how hectic my body was when trying to readjust those first days. Two weeks after my miscarriage, my bbt chart started to follow my regular pattern. I've had my usual temperature drop before a steady rise so both apps (Flo and premom) have ""detected ovulation"" on the same day. Funny enough, it was after some days of watery CM.


But here comes the thing. Every single OPK I've done have been negative. I'm not talking about ""not so sure"" results. I'm talking about 11 OPKs with the faintest lines ever. I had to log the results manually in premom because it will automatically set the result to 0. The maximum I got was 0.25. So, yep. That kind of faint lines.


Although this is my first month using OPKs, I was counting on them for accuracy. So I was simply ruling out this cycle as anovulatory. I mean, my body probably needs time to readjust, right?


So I am extremely confused by the bbt chart and the supposed ""ovulation day"". I expected my bbt chart to change if there was an anovulatory cycle as per the the OPKs. Alternatively, I imagined the OPKs will show some kind of evolution (even if negatives) following my bbt. So now I have no clue which method should I rely on to understand my body.

The stats: My husband (33 M) and I (32F)  have been TTC for one year now. Had a successful conception on our own right before OB put me on Letrozole for developing big follicles (although we didn’t realize I was already pregnant until later). Had a strong heartbeat and good ultrasound at 7 weeks, then lost the pregnancy at 8 weeks for unexplained reasons. Medical abort!on didn’t work so we had to do D&C (right before Christmas, of all times). Everything went as planned and we started TTC again in late January 2019. At first we did it the old fashioned way. Then we started doing Letrozole to grow the follicles + trigger shot to start ovulation + estrogen and progesterone 3 x daily in order to hopefully conceive and keep a pregnancy. This past month we did IUI. Today I got my 5th BFN of this year. 

Yay. 

We’ve tried every single goddamned month since January and NOTHING. Not ONE positive pregnancy test. 

We’ve both had our equipment looked at/scanned/poked and prodded and there’s nothing apparently wrong with either of us. No infertility in either of our families. No obvious reason why this isn’t working. I’m just getting so incredibly down about it all. I’m tired of scheduled sex. I’m tired of getting BFNs EVERY SINGLE MONTH. I’m tired of my OB saying “I feel good about this round!” And “We’re going to get you a baby, don’t worry!”

We are very fortunate in the fact that we have the means to continue doing this—as well as IVF and even a gestational carrier if it comes to that—but it’s still a huge financial strain as money we were trying to save, put into a retirement account, or even use to start a college fund is being earmarked for more fertility treatments/attempts. I should be thankful that we are technically *able* to take advantage of these options, but instead I just feel bitter about the fact that it will still be a major financial hardship. It’s upsetting to both of us that thousands (and possibly hundreds of thousands) of our hard earned money will have to be spent on something that most couples can achieve for free. 

I just feel so pissed off and bitter. And I know that doesn’t help this entire process of TTC, but I don’t know how to change it. 

Perhaps the worst part of all of this, for me, is the look on my husband’s face when we get a BFN. It’s breaking his heart and I can’t do anything to fix it. I just can’t bear seeing him hurt like this. I want to comfort him but I find myself incapable of doing so because I’m so frustrated myself. And I just don’t have anything reassuring to say to him, because I don’t even have anything reassuring to say to myself. 

Thank you for letting me vent. I’m sorry for anything I may have said that triggered anyone or rubbed anyone the wrong way. I just needed to word-vomit these toxic thoughts and get them out of my head.

That was 2 months ago and i have not been doing great and i am afraid of going to sleep and being alone with my thoughts.

I started out with unexplained infertility but i was otherwise healthy, then I miscarried, now all my health is falling apart and every different kind of doctor i have to go see about all my MYSTERY ailments never help me and have me thinking I&#39;m stupid. My OB was the only doctor i liked and had a good history with and now she thinks I&#39;m crazy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so tired of this.</p>

<p>Oh, Also I&#39;m taking BCP this cycle (#3 after the miscarriage) to try and MacGyver my body into working correctly because I&#39;m back to my infertile ways and my RE (not OB) will not do anything for me until i prove with sticker charts that i know what mucus is and that I have sex on mucus days (insurance will not cover any other REs lollll). </p>

<p>I have seen 5 doctors for various things and had 1 trip to the ER since my miscarriage and here i am MacGyvering my fertility.  </p>

<p>Sorry this went off the rails. Please someone comfort me.</p>

166,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello,
I apologize for the length. I want to tell my story of my miscarriage to maybe help begin to heal. I was surprised to find out I was pregnant at the end of February, but my husband and I were so excited. This was my first pregnancy.

On Thursday, May 23rd I went in for an appointment at 16 weeks pregnant. They could not find a heartbeat, which has happened several times before (tilted uterus) so I was not concerned when they set up an ultrasound. I laid down expecting to see my baby bouncing around in my womb and I knew immediately the baby was gone. There was no movement and the ultrasound tech quickly moved the screen and rubbed my arm and said she would be as fast as possible. I started crying. After what felt like an eternity, the doctor finically confirmed my fears. The baby had passed away the week before. Thank God I text my mom during the ultrasound and said things didn’t look right and she headed to the doctors office. She arrived right after they confirmed the baby had passed. 

They gave me the option of having a D&C/E or being induced. Since it was a holiday weekend, they said the D&C/E would not be able to be scheduled until the following Tuesday. I opted for being immediately induced. I could not handle the waiting. 

They sent me over to the hospital and my husband and I were placed in a nice private room at the far end of the labor/delivery unit. The doctors and nurses were so amazing. They were the most caring, empathetic, loving people I have ever experienced. They placed the medicine against my cervix and told me to sit back and wait. At that moment I realized this might take longer than just a couple hours. 

The cramps started about four hours in when they put the second dose of medicine against my cervix. They also started pumping me with pain killers to help numb me a little emotionally. I was a mess, and the doctor was totally fine with drugging me up to help the process be less traumatic. About 10 hours into the induction, I started to have diarrhea and a fever. I also was starting to freak out and asked if I could go to any hospital nearby that would be willing to give me a D&C/E. Unfortunately nowhere was willing to do it without a preliminary appointment and it would take a couple days, so I decided to continue with the induction.

About 23 hours after starting the meds, my cramps became severe enough that I thought I would get an epidural. As the nurse walked in to discuss it with me, I felt the baby come. The nurse and my husband held me as I wept. The placenta took about 30 minutes to come out, so for that time I laid there with my baby between my legs. 

I was so scared to see the baby, but the nurse encouraged me to do it. He was a perfect little baby who was so tiny and precious. I was able to hold him and say goodbye. My husband and both of our moms were also able to hold the little baby. He measured about 5” and was 4 ounces. We instantly fell in love with him. We felt so connected to our sweet baby. We were able to leave about 3 hours later and my husband and I wept on the car ride home over the emptiness that we both felt. 

We decided to get testing done to try to figure out what happened. The doctor seemed very sure it was chromosomal. I have blamed myself for it even though everyone says it is nothing I did. I am a teacher, so I have decided to go back to work for the last day of school on Friday, which will be exactly one week from when I delivered my sweet baby. I had told my work I would not be back for the next school year, so I had to ask for my job back, which was horrible and so sad. All I want to be doing is taking care of my baby, not figuring out if my job will take me back.

I am struggling with the grief, sadness, hormones, everything. The mornings are the worst for me. I cry constantly, but my husband has been incredible. He is such a huge support, and has cried with me, and held me. Today I went to the doctor to get something to help me get through these insane hormones and grief. Thankfully she agreed to give me some Ativan which made today seem slightly more normal. I feel like I will be able to make it through the school day on Friday with minimal crying now. 

Of course now I have huge baby fever. I am aching for a baby. My doctor said no trying for six months, but I feel like I am going to question her on that more when I go in 3 weeks from now. 

Did anyone else go to 16 weeks and have to wait six months? 

Thank you for reading my story. As my bleeding and cramps subside I worry the importance of the baby will also disappear.

ORIGINAL POST:

I'm here because the internet isnt helping and I'm scared I made the wrong choice. 

I went to the ER Thurday night and had my suspicions and fears confirmed.  6.5 weeks along and my first pregnancy is ectopic.  My only symptoms were sudden, intense, stanbbing abdominal pain for a short amount of time on Wednesday and then again on Thursday night. 

The ultrasound confirmed no fetal heartbeat, but my HCG levels are 15,000.  Usually given information like this, I would have taken to Google right away to ferociously research until I felt like I had an understanding of the facts, but I got this news at midnight, right after my first shot of morphine....not for the pain, but because they offered and I honestly wanted to sleep.  

My OBGYN called me and we discussed options and the risks associated with each.  I knew two things, I can take MTX and avoid surgery, or, I can have the pregnancy removed and risk losing my tube.  She told me to think about things and she would be there in the morning to either operate, or write prescriptions for the MTX. 

She showed up at 7am the next morning, and we had the same conversation, to operate or to take the shot.  I weighed the pros and cons, but my Dr really couldn't guarantee which option was the best and left it mostly up to me.

I ended up deciding to take the MTX shot, with a follow up on Monday to check my HCG levels and take a second shot depending on if they are dropping accordingly. 

Here I am, almost 24 hours later, and I'm still not bleeding. I havent had any severe pain for almost 24 hrs and I've also had time to properly research the decision I've made to take the drugs instead of select to have surgery. 

I have only read one study where women with such high HCG levels have had success...mainly when there is no fetal heartbeat (which they would not detect) and the pregnancy is under 2.5cm (mine is 2cm).

Can anyone here offer any experience with an ectopic with such high HCG levels? 

I'm considering calling my Dr again and just asking for the surgery. I didnt realize the MTX would be such a long process...although she did explain this to me, I dont think I REALLY thought about it. 

This fucking sucks and I dont think I've even had time to process this as a loss. Right now, I'm just scared of tubal rupture. I'm scared of having to go back to the ER.

I only read bad things about women with ectopics and high betas and wanted to provide and alternative narrative. I had terrible, terrible side effects from the drug that lasted about a week, but I&#39;m slowly starting to feel like myself again and am hoping I can get to 0 as fast as possible.  Hugs to you all.</p>

<p>ORIGINAL POST:</p>

<p>I&#39;m here because the internet isnt helping and I&#39;m scared I made the wrong choice. </p>

<p>I went to the ER Thurday night and had my suspicions and fears confirmed.  6.5 weeks along and my first pregnancy is ectopic.  My only symptoms were sudden, intense, stanbbing abdominal pain for a short amount of time on Wednesday and then again on Thursday night. </p>

<p>The ultrasound confirmed no fetal heartbeat, but my HCG levels are 15,000.  Usually given information like this, I would have taken to Google right away to ferociously research until I felt like I had an understanding of the facts, but I got this news at midnight, right after my first shot of morphine....not for the pain, but because they offered and I honestly wanted to sleep.  </p>

<p>My OBGYN called me and we discussed options and the risks associated with each.  I knew two things, I can take MTX and avoid surgery, or, I can have the pregnancy removed and risk losing my tube.  She told me to think about things and she would be there in the morning to either operate, or write prescriptions for the MTX. </p>

<p>She showed up at 7am the next morning, and we had the same conversation, to operate or to take the shot.  I weighed the pros and cons, but my Dr really couldn&#39;t guarantee which option was the best and left it mostly up to me.</p>

<p>I ended up deciding to take the MTX shot, with a follow up on Monday to check my HCG levels and take a second shot depending on if they are dropping accordingly. </p>

<p>Here I am, almost 24 hours later, and I&#39;m still not bleeding. I havent had any severe pain for almost 24 hrs and I&#39;ve also had time to properly research the decision I&#39;ve made to take the drugs instead of select to have surgery. </p>

<p>I have only read one study where women with such high HCG levels have had success...mainly when there is no fetal heartbeat (which they would not detect) and the pregnancy is under 2.5cm (mine is 2cm).</p>

<p>Can anyone here offer any experience with an ectopic with such high HCG levels? </p>

<p>I&#39;m considering calling my Dr again and just asking for the surgery. I didnt realize the MTX would be such a long process...although she did explain this to me, I dont think I REALLY thought about it. </p>

<p>This fucking sucks and I dont think I&#39;ve even had time to process this as a loss. Right now, I&#39;m just scared of tubal rupture. I&#39;m scared of having to go back to the ER. </p>

<p>Thank you all..im sorry we are all here.</p>
