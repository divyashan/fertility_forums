Long story short, I had a MMC and a d&amp;c 4 weeks ago (was 10 weeks at the time). My recovery has been absolutely brutal in terms of bleeding. I will spare you the details, except to say that it had stopped about 10 days ago and I thought I was in the clear.\n\nThen, yesterday I started bleeding bright red blood. I had been feeling PMS symptoms for the couple days before (emotional, weepy, bloated), spotting, and watched my HCG get fainter on my test strips, so I was hoping this was finally my period since it had been 4 weeks since the surgery.\n\nToday, I passed what I \\*know\\* is placental tissue. It is about the size of a quarter. I had this same complication after my son's birth 5 years ago - retained placental fragments - which I only realized when I started passing the actual tissue 6 weeks after the birth. I had to have a d&amp;c at that time.\n\nI am so, so pissed about this happening again. I warned the doctor doing the surgery that this had happened to me before, I told my midwife at the follow up that I was terrified it was happening again because of my crazy bleeding, and everyone dismissed my concerns.\n\nI called a high risk Obgyn and will be seen next Tuesday but...anyone else ever go through this and manage to avoid another surgery? I'm scared of having another d&amp;c, desperate to start TTC, and just feeling so mad at the universe right now...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5000, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Retained tissue after MMC ... help :( (TW, mention of living child)", "updated_utc": 1555210883, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bcm8ml/retained_tissue_after_mmc_help_tw_mention_of/"}, {"author": "nomtnhigh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_36cg72x", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1555128635, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bcms0s/mc_imminent_having_decision_paralysis_could_use/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "bcms0s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7465d7b8-7120-11e4-9568-12313d14791d", "link_flair_text": "Trigger - Current MC", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bcms0s/mc_imminent_having_decision_paralysis_could_use/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1555128636, "score": 5, "selftext": "I had an ultrasound on Monday when I should have been 8+1 (bbt tracking + ovulation sticks confirmed timing), was measuring about 6 weeks and no heartbeat found, with some abnormalities in the gestational sac noted. Had my HCG tested twice this week and it rose but nowhere near doubled. \n\nThis is almost a carbon copy of the MC I had last year. That time my midwives were more optimistic/dismissive and wanted to wait for another ultrasound before even mentioning the word miscarriage, and I ended up miscarrying naturally while waiting for the next ultrasound. It was extremely painful and involved diarrhea, vomiting, chills/fever for about 5 hours. If possible I would like to never have to go through that again. It did, however resolve relatively quickly with no tissue retained.\n\nThis time basically everyone agrees that it doesn't look good, though they want to do another HCG draw and actually see the numbers going down before taking any action. I'll do that tomorrow, and if HCG is lower than the last one I could have misoprostol tomorrow. Or I could wait till Monday and have a D&amp;C. If HCG is not decreasing, I may have to wait and keep testing or wait for another ultrasound. \n\nI'm eager to get the whole thing over with. The waiting around and still having pregnancy symptoms while my head is already jumping ahead to grieving and figuring out when we're going to be able to try again is just the worst. If I take the misoprostol I will likely have another painful physical experience but things will at least be moving forward, and my SO will be around over the weekend to look after me. If I wait a few more days I can skip the awful part but have to endure a new unknown procedure which is a bit scary and SO won't have quite as much time to spend with me. \n\nThe decision may be moot if HCG doesn't decrease tomorrow. I'd love to hear about your experiences if you are willing to share them.

We had a dating ultrasound at 6 weeks 5 days that showed a heart beat, due date was 11/7; and we breathed a little easier.  \n\nI started spotting Wednesday night at work; not too much, but noticeably, and I started to be anxious about it. Got my 10 week NIPT lab draw Thursday morning. The spotting had kinda subsided by the morning when I got home, went to sleep, but woke up at noon to mild cramping and bleeding.  called the clinic, and they said I could wait until my Dr appointment the next day, that it was either fine or a miscarriage, and there was nothing they could do to stop a miscarriage; but I could also go to Urgent care if I felt I needed to be seen and gave me parameters if I needed to go into the ED.  I called into work for Thursday night. and tried to wait it out, but between increasing cramping and bleeding and my anxiety and my husbands encouragement we decided to go to Urgent Care; and then they decided to send me to the ED since my bleeding had increased by the time I got to urgent care.  The nurses and OB docs were great there, very compassionate. The only thing I have to say it that one of the paramedics asked me if I was hoping for a boy or girl and I couldn't even respond, like sir, i'm pretty sure I'm miscarrying at this point because I can't imagine this pain and bleeding can mean anything else.  And indeed, no HB on the ultrasound. They were luckily able to do a vacuum aspiration in the ED so I wouldn't have to go home and deal with the continuing MC at home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're upset and sad and processing still. Everyone has been great. We're older (I'm 38; he's 52) and we still want to TTC, but with my age I feel like there's a timeline and it's stressful. We'll see. Obviously we have to wait a little bit anyway. Weird normal things you have to deal with when this is happening. We're redoing our kitchen and after only getting about 4 hours of sleep that night I woke up to dealing with the fact that they had delivered the wrong flooring to our house.  Got that sorted out. and then how do you deal with feeling devastated and sad about the MC, yet happy about your beautiful new hardwood floors? I tell myself that I shouldn't feel guilty about that, or enjoying a cup of coffee, or enjoying breaking out season 10 of Dr. Who, but it's hard.

I'm 31, and my husband and I have been married for a while but just started trying last summer. This whole process has been incredibly frustrating, heartbreaking. I'm doing okay now but I'm really stuck on trying to decide my next steps. I do have an appointment with my Ob/Gyn to discuss this next week, but I guess I'm just trying to think ahead.\n\nAfter my second loss, I started on Prometrium (progesterone) supplements after ovulation for presumed luteal phase defect, as my luteal phase was only 10 days with very very light periods. Obviously that didn't work. \n\nI've had some more blood work drawn now, my thyroid is normal, clotting time is normal, and I do not have antiphospholipid syndrome. So there goes a bunch of \"fixable\" things to blame for the repeated losses. I'm still waiting on a karyotype. I also had a transvaginal ultrasound and that was normal.\n\nTo make all this a bit more complicated, I'm moving across the country in a few weeks so will be needing to look for a new Ob/Gyn, and probably won't have time to get done much more testing before I go (like if my OB recommended an endometrial biopsy or anything like that).\n\nIt's hard to stop my brain from jumping to conclusions. I keep thinking about how even with the progesterone supplements my period is very light, perhaps I could need an estrogen supplement too? I've started on some extra vitamins/supplements (vitamin C, co-q 10, &amp; L-arginine in addition to the prenatal, vitamin D, and omega-3s I was already taking) now as well, because I figure, it can't make things worse than they already are... \n\nSo after all that rambling I guess I just wanted to share. Maybe hear if anyone here has gone through something similar.

It's 1 AM right now where I'm at and I am just not able to sleep. I just needed something off my chest, this is going to be a long read so please bear with me. (also i have not really posted so much, so if i have broken some kind of rule about posting, PLEASE PLEASE correct me/educate me, thank you)\n\nBack in early 2017, my husband and I decided to finally have children. we have been married for 4 years and are still in our early mid 20's and thought that THIS is the time that we should try and make and addition to our family. And with all our friends pretty much announcing their pregnancy one after another, in a way i felt pressured but at the same time I truly always imagined myself eventually being a mom, and i felt now was the time to try.\n\n\\*Pressure: from friends and most especially from My MIL\\*\n\nCame august 2017 my supposed period never came, I felt nervous but didn't want to be too hopeful. My period was kind of predictable then, and i thought it was just late for a day like how it would be in some of the months. But it didn't come, so only one way to find out now I had to test, and.. it's positive! I was so happy. Finally I am going to be a mom! \n\nI was 6-7 weeks in and because of all this stupid pressure esp from MIL, even though I felt like it was too early to announce it to the in-laws but I still did,  because of excitement and so MIL would stop pestering me about when are we gonna have babies.\n\n Little background about MIL, my FIL remarried my now MIL , who spoke the same native language i do, and she's nice, and a very religious woman. She always shares about how she prayed for that right man to come into her life even at her age (early, mid 40's) and that, she was happy and lucky that a good man like my FIL was the one that came into her life. I couldn't be more happier with how things turned out. couldn't have been more thankful because previous MIL and I did not get along. \n\nAnyway, for the past probably year, give or take, before we even TTC she has asked me  a dozen of times, when were we going to try and have a baby? That she'd really love to have a baby in our family, since she is older now and probably won't be able to make any children (she was never married before and never had any children). Every time in our casual conversation never fails to ask about it.\n\nSo we announce the pregnancy and everybody was happy.. but she just had to make it weird.. by later touching my belly. Like, I'm 6-7 weeks only that's probably my fats your rubbing (which it is) and it's f\\*cking weird!!!! \\*sigh\\* We continued on with our lives, trying our best to keep a healthy pregnancy,  then the most terrible thing happened. I miscarried. I won't go into more details about that, but as all women that went through this, it does not matter how long the pregnancy has been. A loss IS a loss.\n\nI started questioning everything, if i did something wrong, maybe i just was not ready, I was not prepared for this, that it just was not my time. Asked God why? but then accepted that \"He probably knew better, I just don't understand it now\" It's just that, I never thought it would be me. I know it happens, but i didn't think it would be me.\n\nSo as I go through that my MIL just had to asked, how did it feel and say that that I can just try again (cause you know it's all easy she probably thinks) and said that they are praying for me so we can try again. Really? I just suffered the greatest emotional heartbreak of my life and you tell me that you are praying for me so we can have another baby. I know she meant well, I know she does, but right now I just need to mourn. I just needed my 1st baby to know how much it hurt for us to lose him/her. I hope you understand.\n\nAnd days passed, I tried to continue no matter how hard. But like I said MIL just never fails to do something so inconsiderate. after our loss, she goes on to rub my belly again and say that she is always praying for me that we can be blessed with children. You know how much of a punch it the gut that felt and how much self control i had to exert to not say anything rude. BTW if you want to read something in line with this topic to this read this:  [https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/187758/dont-pray-for-me](https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/187758/dont-pray-for-me) It was a good read for me and somehow help me feel like this were all natural emotions. I felt all this conflicting emotions because i just felt more bitter than thankful about being prayed for. It almost felt like she slapped me on the face. Actually I would have felt better if she just slapped me, than say anything.\n\nSo again i let it slide, She would still talk about children, about how she prays for us, because she knows it's not for her anymore, she wanted to but she knows she can't. All that kind of talk that I know and I can sense that she wants to have children of her own but she follows that rule that you have to pray more for everybody else than for yourself (like in the article). Which again I know her intentions are nice, but just tell me upfront that you and FIL are trying. and don't try to use me in your prayer so you can ask for your own wishes, or tell me that you are praying for me. I already have enough people rubbing it in my face everyday that I don't have a child. That everybody else is getting pregnant except for me. \n\nIn our journey to TTC we ran along some few health issues, i kept getting infection after infection after my MC. Not sure if it's because of stress or what, but on one of our Dr's appointment, we told them we were gonna be late on visiting them because we gotta see the doctor. I left it at that and hoped she would, But as usual, she just had to pepper me questions   \nas soon as we met them that day,  if\" is it because im pregnant???\" and I said \"no\" AND she just would not stop, and asked that same question again like did tou not hear me?..  like, you just can't get a clue?? do you, so I answered,  \"NO, I am not pregnant!! I have an infection &gt;:( \" (and I don't want to tell you, because its MY BUSINESS but you just have to make it yours too. Now will you leave me alone) and She was just \"ok, \\*rubs my back\\* it's ok\" Like really you tell me to calm down when you triggered me!!\n\nSo fast forward to present (recent time). We received a news from my hubby's FIL, \"you're gonna be a Big brother again.\" \"...YAY! \" I was not sure how far along she is now but,  I did not have the courage to ask, 'cause you know, I exerted too much of my energy to be fake happy for them while trying my hardest to hold back tears. \n\n I felt so betrayed by the world. I felt denied. I just wished I die right on the spot so I don't have to endure this BS anymore. \n\nCame next day, we had to see them (I was reluctant but my relationship was more important than my stupid ego/jealousy) and I had to take in more, \"i congratulated her\" and without fail she just had to say \"Oh, we beat you.\" in a casual way, again i know she probably thought it was a funny comment, seeing as how they are a lot older than us. (and probably in her mind, they were not trying, because they were older even though, let's be honest they were hopeful - nothing bad about it- and WERE trying, I just had enough of the Hypocrisy) \n\nWow thanks. That's just what I needed to hear... to die inside, to hate the world , to hate everything! Oh and I have to endure more, So came Easter, after a tough battle with myself and my sanity for half of the day(thanks to my hubby who was so, so supportive &lt;3 I love him so much, I dunno how i could have survived this hurdle without him) I picked myself up again and went to see them and be a family on this day and be truly happy for them. I came to terms with myself that I am being being too petty, that i should stop this jealousy and get my shit together. That she just didn't mean all the things she said to be mean, and even if it IS mean, that was NOT her intention.\n\nSo we went. And I felt lighter and more collected, but not smart as you'll see because of course, I had to ask her about all this questions , about when did they know, and all those pregnancy questions, but that was a mistake (I just never learn) So she started telling me about all this things that she was doing so weirdly before she even knew (which is understandable and normal or not normal i guess depends on the \"pregnancy symptom/ craving\" you are having lol.) How she was praying for us  AND (in a casual what-I'm-gonna-say-next-is-not-as-important-so-I-passingly- say-it) was praying for themselves too, But of course praying for US first and foremost.  Bless us first as a couple and them maybe them if its \"His will\"\n\n....I just feel so evil, So bad about even feeling this hatred and annoyance and all this emotions, that I just can't sleep. I cannot have peace with myself. The person I least expected to have problems is giving me all the stress and grief... I just don't know how long I can go on with this. \n\nThank you for letting this off my chest.

A little quick history. Last year every time we tried, we got pregnant although every single one ended in a miscarriage. We started working with an RE in December and in January we decided to try again. My RE suggested Clomid, but we thought we get pregnant so we have no issues ovulating. The plan we to try unmediated, no Clomid the first cycle, but add in progesterone 5 days after a positive OPK. Well cycle day 18 rolled around and no positive OPK. So called the doctor they did an ultrasound, wasn't ovulating but I had a good follicle. So they gave me a trigger shot. That pregnancy ended in a chemical pregnancy. So last month we decided to listen to the doctor and do Clomid. Cycle day 15 rolled around, no positive OPK not even a hint of a positive, not even a flashing smiley. So we did an ultrasound, good size follicle and did a trigger. This time we didn't get a positive pregnancy test. Nothing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to note that prior we just used an app called Clue to track my cycles. We never used an OPK prior to working with the RE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is, do you guys think I have always had late/no ovulation? Has anyone experienced this?
