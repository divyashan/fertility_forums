At the time, my wife (I'll call her H) and I had been trying to concieve for 7 or 8 months before we finally got a positive pregnancy test. H took multiple over a span of two weeks with them all saying positive. We were waiting to go to the doctor because her grandmother was in town visiting and we wanted to suprise the whole family together and didn't want grandma to know yet. On Wednesday morning my wife woke up with heavy bleeding and we started to get panicked and we rushed to the on base hospital. (I'm in the Air Force) We went to the emergency room and told them that H was about 6 weeks along and that we hadn't come in to confirm the pregnancy yet and she was having heavy bleeding. They took us back into the room to be checked out. H brought the pregnancy tests with her which, keep in mind, were taken over a span of 2 weks and were 3 different brands. The airmen who were tending to her (the highest one was a SrA and there was even a freaking tech schooler in there) were telling each other jokes the entire time we were in there completely regardless to the fact we were in the process of losing our child. Part of me thinks that it was because my wife and I are both young so the people probably thought we were relieved to be losing the kid since so many people like to wait until their late 20s or early 30s. When they finaly took my wife back to go recieve an ultrasound, they made her use the bathroom first and she passed the fetus in there. She saw the embryonic sack, but when she moved to get a better look the automatic toilet flushed. They then did the ultrasound and said that there wasn't anything in there. Despite the fact we had 5 pregnancy tests saying she was pregnant, and the fact that there was HCG in the blood report, they decided that she had never actually been pregnant. They said and I quote, \"The HCG levels were low, so you aren't pregnant.\" It was to my understanding that if you had any HCG that meant you were, but okay. My wife is now terrified of trying to get pregnant again because she is so scared of them not taking it serious or believing that she is actually pregnant. She's also scared that we're likely to lose more babies because since they said she was never pregnant to begin with, they won't give her the rogam shot to make sure that her body doesn't attack that baby. (We're both Rh- but my mom was positive and we don't know her biological dad's) She just told me yesterday that she still can't sleep (we're on opposite schedules so I haven't been aware of this) 2 months later and that she can't stop zoning out thinking about it. I thought I was handling it well until 2 weeks ago when she started talking to me about it more, because I didn't know that she had passed it before getting the ultrasound, and I broke down into hysterics. All I could think about was that he was supposed to be my baby and be a person, not get flushed down a toilet and eaten by some freaking fish. I've taken to carrying a onsie that I had bought before it happened in my cargo pocket so that I can still feel close to him.

I have two living children. I was on progesterone injections with my oldest until 24 weeks and progesterone suppository with my youngest until 10ish weeks when I just had a feeling everything was fine. I was on progesterone for my last two miscarriages and baby aspirin with the last. \n\nWith my last two pregnancies ending in miscarriage I have seen three different doctors, including an R.E. (which was awful) but finally I pushed my current OB to do more testing and I came up heterozygous for Factor V Leiden. I also am heterozygous for MTHFR a1298c, which I know is common. My plasminogen was also low. \n\nMy frustration is that I can\u2019t find information saying that these conditions really and truly cause clotting or miscarriages. I am just looking for SOMETHING. Some clue to try something else to give me some hope. \n\nI\u2019m 28, I get pregnant quickly, all my other extensive labs were normal. My children were born on the small side but nothing indicative of intrauterine growth restriction that I know of. 38.4weeks and 6lbs 12oz and 37.6 and 5lbs 13oz. The only thing that happened with both pregnancies was that my uterus measured weeks behind at the end of both and I had to have an extra ultrasound to check fluid levels. Could that be a sign of IGR?\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised about the FVL because my period comes out in small clots with no flow... but it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s normal or not. If I have a clotting disorder that\u2019s not THAT big of a deal as far as the research shows, then why am I seeing these clots in my period?

My period started a week early, but it was a day or two shorter than my other periods.  I had an HSG test scheduled, which can only done between the 7th and 10th day of your cycle.  I go to my appointment, do the normal pregnancy pee test beforehand, and they come back and tell me it's positive.  I'm like...how is that possible? My period ended three days prior. But they did a blood test and that confirmed I was pregnant. They conducted several more blood tests over the next couple weeks and saw that it was slowly but surely rising.  I was thrilled about being pregnant, but I just knew something wasn't right.  Four weeks later, I was rushed to the ER with the worst pain in my stomach that I ever felt.  They saw that I was more like 9 weeks along and it was ectopic, the tube had burst and they performed emergency surgery to save my life.  This was my second miscarriage, my first was four years ago.   The doctors don't know why they ended the way they did, and I'm started to wonder if I'll ever have a baby.\n\nNow it's October and my period started a week early, AGAIN, and I have an HSG appointment scheduled this week, AGAIN.  I took a pregnancy test and it was negative, but I have no idea what to feel right now. I just hate that I can never just be like, \"Oh, my period's early. Weird. Oh well.\" I keep thinking I'm going to have the same thing happen to me all over again, and lose my remaining tube and my last chance to have a baby normally.  I hate that I'm always going to worry.  I hate that I'll never have that excitement of a postitive test and surprising my husband, but instead I'll always be guarded and worried until the first trimester is over. I hate that my friends are immediately announcing their pregnancies after only a month, then go on to have healthy babies with no complications. \n\nThank you for listening/reading, I'm just venting.

I had my miscarriage earlier this year in February, first pregnancy &amp; first loss at 19. It was an abusive, horrible time. I have now been with somebody who has completely 360\u2019d my life around. We\u2019ve been together for 6 months. \nAnyway, me and my fianc\u00e9 would like to try for a baby, however we have an ongoing problem with DE (Delayed Ejaculation) I want to just say, this is not in any way anxiety related, he can ejaculate just fine in front of me &amp; the method we\u2019re using well, I just want all your insights into it, whether you think it is going to work. Basically, he will get me off, and then we will lay down and either him or me will jerk him off to the point of ejaculation &amp; just as he does, he puts it as far in me as he can. We do this the 3/4 days of being fertile &amp; ovulation. We\u2019re taking prenatal vitamins, not smoking, not drinking, we don\u2019t do drugs, no caffeine. I feel like we\u2019re trying so hard, yet it just is not happening. Is the way we are doing it decreasing our chances? Or is it just a waiting game? I feel so envious of people getting pregnant, because we both want this so badly. DE is not nice, it gets him down a lot, we wanted to try this method before going to the doctors as we believed it would work just the same. It has not been long, a couple of months at that, but we haven\u2019t been \u201ctrying\u201d as such, with being prepared health wise etc with making sure we take the right things, do the right things. We\u2019re just now doing that, but I still keep feeling so hopeless. I just want some light to be shed so I can stop getting so upset.

Currently in our 2nd cycle of trying and hopeful this is going to be the month. \n\nBut this trying thing, it's so scary. I've been pregnant twice (once at 21 and again in May) and both resulted in miscarriages. In my last pregnancy, I was told I have a bicornuate uterus and that pregnancy along with any future pregnancies would be considered high-risk. I also had extremely low progesterone. \n\nSo here I am. Trying. Tracking ovulation, planning which days are best, eating progestrone filled foods. And that makes me both more stressed and more relaxed. \n\nStressed because I'm already worrying before I'm even pregnant. There's stress in TTC that was never in previous pregnancies. Previously, the stress didn't start until after the positive HPT.  \nBut less stressed at the same time. I'm eating better than normal (and I already ate healthy before ttc), eating foods that are high in progestrone, and I'm already taking prenatals and have been for over a month.  But that does add the fear of I'm doing everything \"right\" and it can still \"fail\" and I'm scared of how I'll pick myself up after that. \n\nI'm not really sure what the point of this post is. I think I just needed an outlet. The excitement and stress is intense but I'm trying to keep the excitement as my main feeling. Trying not to let fear get to me. Trying to stay positive and remember if I miscarry again, its not the end and that I have time still. Trying to remember the people in my life who have had 3 miscarriages and still went on to have a baby. And writing everything down.

I went in for my first official ultrasound at 8 weeks (did one prior but they couldn't really see anything bc they said it was too early).  They found that it was a molar pregnancy, got a D&amp;C the following day. The doctors told me that after the surgery, I would have to come in weekly to check if my hCG levels were going down. And that we couldn't actively TTC and to use some sort of birth control. I didn't follow this advice. (I am judging myself) So weekly I went in, and my levels were steadily decreasing. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I got to down to 3, and then a week later I get a call from my doctor saying that my levels increased back to 555. My first thought was a possible regrowth and/or cancer. My doctor voiced her opinion saying that she also thinks it's a regrowth and to make an appointment with a gyno-oncologist which I did. But knowing that I had unprotected sex and we weren't careful a few times, I told her that so she told me to come in to check my levels again.  I went in for two more blood tests, Friday 9/27 they were at 1933, and then the following Monday 9/30 it was 5414. \n\nI had my appointment yesterday, and at first the oncologist took a look at my history, information, and levels and agreed with my OB and said it could be a possible re-growth. I told him that we did have unprotected sex, which I got a scolding for. He said he would set up an ultrasound to rule out the possibility of a new pregnancy. I went into the ultrasound thinking they would find a regrowth but the technician said she didn't see any signs of regrowth and she found a gestational sac. \n\nHere is where I need your opinion/advice: What does this all mean? I remember when I went in for that early ultrasound with my first pregnancy, they did see something but they couldn't make out what it was. Just because a gestational sac is there doesn't mean that a molar pregnancy can't come back right? The doctor hasn't called me back yet, and I'm so confused. The technician said that the doctors will probably have me do more blood work and another ultrasound. Any advice would be helpful.

My son was the last \"baby x.\" They've barely acknowledged him, and in fact haven't mentioned him since his funeral. It's been almost two years. Secondly, I really dislike my BIL. He's done some pretty inexcusable things to my husband that we are expected to ignore and move on from because \"that's just how he is\" and \"we're family.\" I don't trust him, and he says hurtful things all the time that make me dislike being around them. Third, I have PTSD from my loss. One of my biggest triggers is being around pregnant women and babies. When she is pregnant, they make it a huge deal and talk about nothing else. Seriously, the last pregnancy from 8 weeks on she was talking about nothing but new baby. Finally, they see the world completely differently from my husband and I, and make comments all the time about how we should be living our lives or doing, even though they know we are nothing like them. \n\nWe are trying to get pregnant right now, about to do our third IUI. My mom asked me if I was pregnant if I think my PTSD about being around pregnant women would get better, and I told her I honestly don't know. I have no idea how I\"ll react to situations until they happen. On top of that, I know that given my reluctance to talk about our infertility and treatment, I doubt I'll be up for talking about or getting excited about my next pregnancy until at least 24 weeks. Based on our treatment dates, my SIL and I would have due dates two weeks apart.\n\nI texted my parents-in-law last night that I don't begrudge them having a baby (I never would, and they have some pretty serious fertility issues), but that for my own personal mental well being, I can't attend family events if she's pregnant for the time being with the specific situation we are in. I'm usually a people pleaser, so this is hard for me to say to anyone, but I already hate the holidays. My son died right before Thanksgiving, and Christmas is stressful. My in-laws made some non-committal type comments about understanding and hoping things get better with my PTSD soon, but history says my husband will be getting pressure about why I'm not at an event. \n\nI\"m just trying to figure out if I'm the asshole here. I really do not begrudge them having a baby, I hope their IVF is successful, I just do not want to have PTSD meltdowns at Thanksgiving or be forced to talk about pregnancy and the miracle of babies at birthday events. I don't expect anyone to change their topics of conversation for me, and I feel like if I'm the one with a trigger and I can avoid it, I should. I'm already an introvert with anxiety.

Now that we are actively TTC after my first miscarriage that I had on July 10th at 8weeks - I am just feeling a horrible amount of anger come through. Right now I am unbelievably stressed and mad that we may not have had sex on the right days this month. When I got pregnant in May we got pregnant doing every other day method. This month we only did it 4 times and according to \u201cFlo\u201d only 2 of those times were close enough to ovulation to have a chance.  I just get so mad at my husband because he doesn\u2019t see the urgency that I do to get pregnant again obviously, because he doesn\u2019t make sex a priority this time around. \n\nEvery month that passes is excruciating to me. I just want to give our son a sibling that he can grow up playing with and be friends with. I wanted them close in age. \n\nI keep thinking horrible thoughts like maybe I\u2019m not a good mom to my son and that\u2019s why this isn\u2019t working. Or that the stress I feel will hurt my chances. But I don\u2019t know how to not stress. I can\u2019t sleep at night I just think about the timeline of things. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for venting when I know I\u2019m very lucky to have a son. I was an only child and I hated it so much that I think I\u2019m experiencing this extreme fear of having only 1 or having them too far apart on my son. \n\nThanks to anyone who read my story.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6096, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Stress and Anger Middle of the Night", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570346550, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ddk00u/stress_and_anger_middle_of_the_night/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MissPirateLady", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1cuso0bw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570286687, "domain": "parenting.nytimes.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ddo432/awesome_article_about_grief_coping_and_pregnancy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ddo432", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ddo432/awesome_article_about_grief_coping_and_pregnancy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570286689, "score": 20, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6097, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Awesome article about grief, coping and pregnancy loss", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570373072, "url": "https://parenting.nytimes.com/pregnancy/after-a-miscarriage-grief-anger-envy-relief-and-guilt?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;fbclid=IwAR0YK69WNKsBH3hd6UxbiCkxsMugtq35HlIxJsz1eYTQd4ESPhyHDy4-qDA"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MissPirateLady", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1cuso0bw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570291185, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ddp2da/my_mom_surprised_me_today_in_a_good_way/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ddp2da", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ddp2da/my_mom_surprised_me_today_in_a_good_way/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570291269, "score": 34, "selftext": "I sent her a link to an article about pregnancy loss (husband and I had a stillbirth just over a year ago).
