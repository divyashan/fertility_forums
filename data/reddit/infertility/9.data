I really dragged my feet posting here, after all, we aren't \"that\" infertile, so why post, it'll happen.  Well, it hasn't happened, and I think our last chance will be Monday, so I'm reaching out.\n\nUS: Me (f) 28.  6 years of BC, ended it 3 months before trying and we just used condoms.   This was September of 2013.  Infertile maternal history, mom needed thyroid meds (but then had 4), and her aunts ranged from childless to 3 kids (in the 1940s, so strange).  Husband, 50, 3 teenagers, no trauma, no vastecomy.\n\nStory: lots of sex, lots of disappointment, 1 chemical pregnancy, ask OB on annual that it has been 9 months and I want to get checked, she says need to try for a year.  Temp and do OPKs.  I show ovulation, always have a temp dip around 10-12DPO and period at CD 27-29.  Doc not worried.  January comes, CD3/CD26/HSG/ultrasound all normal.  Hub tests, a few abnormalities, go to specialists.  I spot monthly around CD 24\n\nHubs abnormalities is low count (68mil), low motility (50%) but neither count as \"infertile\" just low.  Urologist affirms that everything is in the right spot and connected, no reason on his end for no babies.  RE decides IUI, starting with a natural cycle.\n\nMay: I get my positive test, husband contributes his sample with 31mil in cleaned sperm (they want above 5), motility was at 45%, we were told that was good.  We are also told insurance will not cover because Hubs is older than 40, doctor is appealing.  I got my period after 32 days.\n\nJune: Clomid 50mg for 4 days.  Husbands sample had 25mil and they didn't tell us motility.  I had 2 mature follicles, one on either side, and a healthy lining.  Period after 28 days.  Insurance confirms they will not cover procedures.  Insurance sucks.\n\nJuly: I have just finished Clomid 50mg for 5 days.  I am thinking our round will be on Monday.  I have started acupuncture, had a massage, bought some essential oils for myself (YL dragon time and progressence plus if anyone else has tried) and my husband (basil for foot rubs).  I got my husband boxers.  We have decided that I don't have to wake with the alarm and hope extra sleep will help, i have told my boss I will likely be working a reduced schedule to help with stress for two weeks.\n\nThe original plan was only 3 rounds of IUI, which means this is our last chance.  We do not want to do IVF, partially because of the 12k price tag, but it just isn't for us.  I want to talk my RE into a few more rounds of IUI with different meds (progestrone for one), but I'm not sure how much control I have over that.\n\nDoes anyone have other suggestions?  There is no reason for our infertility, and that makes it suck more.  None of my friends are having difficulty, and while nice to bitch to, they have no words for me other than \"wow, that sucks.\"  \"what happens, happens.\"\n\nThanks for reading.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I didn't want to post here, but hi.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3ci0e4/i_didnt_want_to_post_here_but_hi/"}, {"author": "Tekaylala7", "author_created_utc": 1342986988, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_8eyka", "created_utc": 1436328097, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1436353361, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3cigb0/husband_wont_let_me_crybe_angry/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3cigb0", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 13, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3cigb0/husband_wont_let_me_crybe_angry/", "retrieved_on": 1440624852, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Why won't he just let me cry and get my anger out.

My husband and I (me 32, him 33, married almost 5 years) have been actively and unsuccessfully trying to conceive for well over 2 years (off BC since December 2012). I've never been pregnant. We participated in a 3-month Letrozole + Ovidrel study followed by 3 monitored/medicated IUIs (Letrozole + Gonal-f + Ovidrel trigger + Progesterone). According to my RE, I responded favorably during each cycle, my husband had sufficient counts, yet we remain unexplained with \"PCOS-like\" responses. My fourth IUI cycle (we had leftover meds and figured we'd give it one last shot...ha) was cancelled due to two small cysts and elevated estradiol. That little break allowed us to commit to moving forward with IVF. \n\nToday I met with my clinic's IVF coordinator to discuss my protocol and had a saline sonogram to check on everything. While it wasn't the same white-hot searing pain of my HSG, I still jumped and involuntarily shouted...very much the waxing scene from 40 Year Old Virgin. Tell me I was not alone in that reaction!? \n\nThe day I realized I needed to unsubscribe from TFAB and pop in over here instead was the day I found comfort in not feeling quite so alone (despite being surrounded by my friends' gorgeous babies -- I'm the only \"non mom\" left in my group, which sounds to be a role many of us here share). I have told a few close friends and my mother and sister about our journey, but outside of that small circle and my spouse, I find it extremely difficult to discuss (plus I'm a crier...an ugly crier).  For as intimidated as I was to start with IUIs, today I was excited to have a new plan and felt much more informed due to this sub. I also now have a huge folder of info to pore over during this next week while I wait to start BCP.\n\nSo for right now, I'm just appreciative of this informative and supportive community you all have created, and I'm trying to be grateful for small distractions like True Detective, gin, and my garden.

I'd love any feedback you ladies have, but I know there is probably not an answer.\n\nI have PCOS - I grow many big eggs very slowly, and they NEVER ovulate on their own.  Like ever.  We worked with an RE for 12 months using increasing doses of Femara and it was the norm to see 2-4 25+mm follicles on CD 13-15 with no LH surge in sight.  We always had to use a HCG trigger.  Pregnant twice, lost both before 8 weeks.  Never had progesterone tested or supplemented during those pregnancies, but that's a rant for another day.\n\nAfter a year of banging out heads against the wall the RE said we could start adding a few days of menopur injections after the femara to increase the number of follicles.  She said we should take a month off to rest, then come in on CD 3 for our first baseline.  Knowing we wanted to get as much done in the summer as we could (both my partner and I are teachers) and that I don't ovulate, we asked for help getting through the next cycle, either help ovulating or suppressing so we don't end up with a crazy long cycle or cysts.  She was insistent that we do it with no meds and everything would be fine.\n\nSpoiler alert: Everything was very much not fine.  Everything went terrible.  You'll notice a pronoun change here as in the maelstrom I insisted we switch RE's to someone who might listen to us.\n\nThat 'rest cycle' lasted 3 weeks.  I suspected it wasn't a real period but an estrogen withdrawal bleed from not ovulating, but the CD 3 ultrasound showed what appeared to be (&lt;- important detail) a 16 mm cyst on the right side.  There was nothing else growing, and my estrogen was 70, so he declared it a cyst and said we needed to rest it out.  I was positive nothing good would happen from resting, so I asked to go ahead with the meds as planned and they finally agreed.\n\nCD 9 we go in for another ultrasound.  Now there are TWO 30+mm cysts/follicles on the right, and a 14 mm on the left.  RE admits that the original 16mm was probably two smaller follicles, but one looks like it's already popped so they did a progesterone test.  It came back at 1.2 so he declared that I ovulated on my own and said I should call back when my period starts in two weeks.\n\nMy period started the next day.\n\nUnfortunately that was a holiday and I bled for 4 days before someone returned the calls I left on the emergency number.  They had me rush down to the lab where my estrogen came back at 70 again, progesterone at 1.4.  Cue the head scratching and mumbling from the RE about how he doesn't know why this is happening.  He puts me on progesterone and estrogen to stop the bleeding and suppress follicle growth, and tells me to come in for an ultrasound in two weeks.  I insist to be seen sooner, so he says fine, come back in one week.\n\nWell that was today, where we saw the two 30+mm follicles on the right had shrunk to 25mm, and were now joined by two 10mm buddies.  On the left the one 14mm has become THREE 25mm cysts/follicles.  Cue more head scratching and shrugging about what's going on.\n\nSo for now I'm continuing with 10 mg Provera and 4 mg Estradiol every day.  He's having me come back in a week to see how things are going.  He says he doesn't know what is happening, or if the estrogen/prog I'm on will actually work to suppress anything.  We discussed triggering or using lupron, but he said no to both because they would first stimulate before suppressing and he's worried about how many large follicles/cysts there are already.\n\nSo June was wasted.  July looks like it's going to be wasted too.  I will be lucky to get one try in before I go back to work in August and I want to scream at everyone in that office.\n\nAnybody else been trapping on a never-ending cyst merry-go-round?

Before we do that though, it seems like it sure would make sense to make sure we don't have some genetic issue that's causing this, wouldn't it?  I know our RE said that typically they do karyotyping more for cases of RPL, and she thinks we're more likely to have issues with fertilization.  I get that, that's fair.  But what if the fertilization issue is keeping us from knowing we would also have an RPL issue?  I mean, if we're going to invest ALL this money, it sure seems like it would make sense to get all testing done ahead of time.  Am I wrong?\n\nAlso, my insurance will cover 90% of karyotype testing, so it's hardly even a cost issue.  \n\nAnyway, just wanted to get your thoughts.  \n\nThanks!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Karyotyping", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3cq20e/karyotyping/"}, {"author": "thrillhouse13", "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "32, DOR, Asherman's", "created_utc": 1436497745, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3cr7rc/sf_bay_area_recommendations/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3cr7rc", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 25, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3cr7rc/sf_bay_area_recommendations/", "retrieved_on": 1440620704, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hey ladies,  I know this is super specific, but I was wondering if anyone had any recs for IVF clinics in the SF Bay Area.

I need this before proceeding with IVF because both tubes are hydrosalpinxes (dilated and filled with toxic fluid that can back up into the uterus and cause miscarriage).  \n\nShe suggested that instead of surgery, we consider Essure, which is a permanent form of birth control, essentially metal coils that are inserted into the fallopian tubes.  The coils block the tubes and scar tissue builds up around them to ensure permanent blockage.  This is usually used as a nonsurgical alternative to tubal ligation.  \nBut, while less common, Essure is also sometimes used instead of salpingectomy, is much less costly, and also supposedly takes like ten minutes to insert.  \n\nI have to have a uterine polyp removed in vis hysteroscopy in August, and the idea would be to insert the Essure at the same time.  That way I could avoid the costly and more invasive surgery to actually remove the tubes.  I'd have to wait three months for the scar tissue to form, then I could do IVF.  I could start suppression as early as October if I had them inserted in August during my polyp removal, which is already scheduled.  \n\nIt sounds great and like a no-brainer when I write it all out, but I guess I feel a little reluctant to put permanent metal coils in my abdomen and reproductive organs.  Obviously, those of us here probably haven't done much investigating of permanent birth control, but I'm wondering if anyone has any experience or familiarity with Essure for this reason, or any thoughts about this in general.  (I'm also interested in hearing from anyone with salpingectomy/hydrosalpinx experience.)  Thanks, y'all.  \n\n(One last note, later this month I have an appointment for a second opinion with another Kaiser OB to beg pain as a reason for them covering the salpingectomy.  Right now they're denying coverage because it's IVF-related.

I've been in extreme, extreme pain and sick from the pain meds and pain itself so it's taken me a while to be able to type this out, but I did want to type it out because it was quite a bit different than what I was expecting- and that's likely a lot of my own fault for not looking into lap recovery more. \n\nFirst, the hysteroscopy was to cut down a partial septum that was discovered during my SIS. That went smoothly and I'm now on Estradiol to help my lining thicken so that I heal properly from the septum removal. I have had minor bleeding from that which was mostly bright pink/red in a light flow. \n\nNow to the laparoscopy! I was having it done because a 2.5cm endometrioma was found in my left ovary during the same SIS. With that discovery added to my extensive endometriosis symptoms, my RE decided that a lap and endo ablation was the best course of action prior to starting out IVF cycle, even though she did not plan to attempt to remove the endometrioma for fear of losing follicles. Looking back, this was a very wise decision because as my RE put it, my entire abdominal cavity was \"overtaken by very severe endometriosis\" which she said was at least Stage 4. She also found one of my tubes to be swollen (hydrosalpinx) and the other tube was completely blocked off and closed by endometriosis scarring. I lost both tubes that day and a 45 minute lap turned into a 3 hour endometriosis removal and bilateral salpingectomy. \n\nIf we had not already been fully prepared to move onto IVF, I would be an utter basket case with depression and grief, but due to the suspected endometriosis and severe MFI (nerve damage leading to low volume but high count) we have already planned and saved to begin IVF mid-August. I was not at all expecting to lose my tubes and I am sad that I'll never be able to naturally conceive or to get that amazing \"surprise\" pregnancy that may have been possible, but like I said, we knew we were doing IVF so I'm okay. \n\nThe thing I was the least prepared for was/is the pain. It feels as if I am a jack-o-lantern and someone scraped my insides out with one of those serrated paddles. The first day, I was out of it on anesthesia, but that night I barely slept due to the pain and inability to pee but having the urgency to go. Then yesterday, I was in total agony. I could not lay or sit in any position that was not brutally painful. I was/am so swollen and I've put on 6 pounds of fluid. I did go in to see my RE at her insistence when I called about my pain levels. She showed me the pictures of my insides (endo scarring and tissue on my diaphragm, liver, bladder, bowels, tubes, uterus, ovaries, and urethra- it looked like someone had set off firecrackers in there) and explained everything to me that had happened. She suggested suppository laxatives to relieve some pressure (they did not work) and gave me 10 more Percocet on top of the 12 she gave me post-op and told me to take two at a time. I did and puked 30 minutes later- haha. So back to taking one Percocet about ever two to four hours and 800mg ibuprofen at 8hr intervals. I have another appt in the morning because she is concerned about my stomach swelling (it's big) and I'm hoping to get a different medication that doesn't make me so sick. \n\nSo there's my story so far. IVF is tentatively scheduled for August 14 to start meds! We are so excited. We have allowed ourselves to get excited for the first time in 3.5 years and it feels good and scary and lovely all at once. Thanks for reading and letting me vent! Is anyone else doing IVF at the same time as we are?\n\n\nEDIT: for grammatical errors and some added details for clarification.

Either way, this has been a crazy 12 months and I'm so grateful to have had this group as a support system, even if I mostly lurked. For those who have stuck it out for years, I have so much respect for your tenacity and strength and will continue to think of you.  I only wish I had the strength to keep going, but I just can't do it anymore. Knowing I had others experiencing the same frustrations as me make this whole thing a little more tolerable, even if that sounds pretty dark.

We were trying to get pregnant for a couple of months on our own and I had this crazy feeling that something \"wasn't right\". I knew my husband was born with undescended testicles and didn't get them fixed until he was 13, so I asked my ob/gyn if she could give us a prescription for a semen analysis. I remember I was in the middle of teaching my class of 5th grade kids when I ran into the closet to take the call with our results. The semen analysis showed that my husband had zero sperm. We were crushed. \n\nThe doctor sent us to get a second test done, which came back as a zero sperm count again. We find a male infertility specialist who does a million tests on my husband over multiple visits. We find out that there's a really good chance he will never be able to have his own children due to having his undescended testicle surgery really late in life. My husband is devastated and I'm absolutely livid at his parents for neglecting their child and letting this happen to him. I still can't talk to them without getting angry. \n\nThe doctor suggests that my husband have the TESE procedure just to be 100% positive that he doesn't have any sperm inside his body, and that I would need to do IVF if they were to find any sperm. The first available appointment is about 4 months away, so we book it and I start to see one of the best fertility clinics in the area. We are also told to start looking for donor sperm as a back up. \n\nA couple of months go by and I officially start the IVF process. I'm noticing the office is a little bit negative and the staff never really looks at you when they're talking, but I'm fine with it because this doctor is supposed to get results. Besides, I'm not really there to make friends, right? I subscribe to a few of those IVF facebook groups and try to prepare myself for the stims. Now, my doctor never really gave me a \"game plan\" and I'm getting most of my information from google and these groups, so I have no idea what's normal and what isn't. I take the birth control like they ask me to and go in for my first sonogram before stims at CD17. They see two large things on my sonogram and can't decide if they are cysts or follicles. The doctors tell me they aren't sure how they'd like to handle this, but to start my stims anyway.\n\nThe cyst/follicles were growing bigger, and every single one of my 13 morning  blood/sono visits I'm told that they don't know if they're going to be able to save my cycle or scrap it. I don't understand how they don't know if they're cysts or follicles by now and the doctors are being completely negative about my cycle working at all for me.\n\nNow I'm feeling a whole mess of emotions during this thing. I'm getting angry that the doctors had MONTHS to prepare me for IVF and should have been more on top of things considering my husband is having his TESE procedure. I'm pissed off that I've been doing stims of 13 days in a row and now they're still talking about wanting to cancel it after I've already wasted so much time, medicine and money.  I'm getting upset because the doctor's office is such a negative place and the staff doesn't even look at me when they talk to me. Every question that I have for them is answered in a condescending tone, that I'm eventually scared to ask anything else. \n\nI start asking my questions on one of my IVF Facebook pages, only to be shot down by the girls on there because since it's my husband who has the infertility, I'm technically completely healthy and don't \"need\" IVF. I stop posting on these pages because I don't really fit in there.  I'm stuck in this weird category of being fertile but having an infertile husband while having IVF done to me and my body just simply not responding. \n\nIn the end, they weren't monitoring me close enough and I started ovulating on my own 4 days before my ER, so they had to cancel both mine and my husband's procedure. The only available appointment is in October, so we wait again and hope they won't mess this one up. It's extremely frustrating since we made this appointment so long ago and now have to wait again because the staff wasn't on top of it. It just doesn't seem fair. And there aren't any other doctors who specialize in the TESE procedure in our area. I feel like I need to be strong for my husband while putting my own body through this as well. It sucks. Big time. \n\nI'll try to post more updates as I hear them from the doctor, but I just wanted to share my story with you guys. Thanks for listening.
