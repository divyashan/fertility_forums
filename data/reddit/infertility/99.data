On August 2nd I woke up and took a clear blue which showed positive again, so because of the bleeding I went to the hospital where they performed an ultrasound. They said that my tests from home were definitely positive and that it may be too early to see anything on ultrasound. They suggested I get a blood test from my OBGYN. The next morning I took another test and there was no line. I was also no longer spotting. When I went to the OBGYN they said that there was hcg in my system but not enough to determine a definitive positive. They also suggested that I may have miscarried or that I was having a cryptic pregnancy. Another possibility is ectopic. There has been no further bleeding and It has been 50 days since the end of my last period. Mind you when I took my tests I took them with the first pee of the day for the two positives. One was a first response and one was a clear blue. I am NOTICEABLY more fatigued and I have severe daily dizziness as well as noticeable nausea which none of those things are normal to me at any point in my cycle.

On top of the doctors not really having a definitive answer for me my cousin went through a similar experience when she first got pregnant with her daughter now and the women on my moms side of the family have experienced odd pregnancies yet still had a completely healthy baby.

She took her first test using her first pee of the day and got a positive than she took another the next day and got a positive yet she still bled and experienced symptoms of her period. She went to the hospital the day after her second positive and they told her there was no way she was pregnant and gave her a negative blood result.

About a month ago I got the diagnosis of \"significant endometriosis\" with 2 endometriomas on my left ovary (both 8cm) and 2  on my right (one 8cm, one 2cm). I was pretty caught off guard when I heard this. The first 2 days of my period I have fairly significant cramps, but it's been like this since the very beginning (age 13) and was told it wasn't endo and to take naproxen. \nI was like a deer in the headlights when my doctor told me about these endometiomas. He recommended 3 IUI's then either surgery or IVF. I didn't ask any questions because I didn't know what to say. I'm in the middle of my first IUI cycle currently. My clinics \"rules\" are that I can't have an appointment with my doctor unless I finish my 3 IUI's or I decide to no do anymore IUI's, but can't talk to him during active treatment unless it's urgent. This really bothered me! \nI've since been researching and googling (non stop, which is causing me anxiety), and I now have a referral to one of the best clinics in the area. Where I live we can also have 1 government funded IVF cycle (and this clinic has no wait time because they are a big fancy downtown clinic that gets the most funding). \nI'm looking for advice for what the best questions would be for this doctor? I want to be as prepared as I can for my consultation and not have a repeat deer in the headlights reaction I had last time. \nI've also read that this doctor doesn't usually do Lupron for endo. Does anyone have opinions on that? I've read that it increases success with FET.\n\nThank you!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19994, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My head is spinning (looking for advice on endo/IVF)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/igdpcs/my_head_is_spinning_looking_for_advice_on_endoivf/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Caresscashmere", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7tymsd24", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598369478, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/igeekc/ive_never_been_pregnant_am_i_broken/", "gildings": {}, "id": "igeekc", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/igeekc/ive_never_been_pregnant_am_i_broken/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1598369490, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19996, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I\u2019ve never been pregnant.

I was wondering if anyone else had similar experience or any insight on this issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's our situation:\n\nWe've been trying for 3 years, and have been getting help for nearly 2 years now. I am now 35F and my partner is 33M. I had normal hormone levels and a good ovarian reserve, and my partner has severe OATS (Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia - low sperm count, bad motility, and abnormal shapes). We have done 4 IVF cycles and all have failed because they have failed to produce a blastocyst. My clinic wants to do day 5/6 transfers only, and the embryos always arrest before they reach the blastocyst phase. All of our cycles have been done with IMSI (ICSI but with higher magnification of the sperm). My partner has attempted to do a DNA fragmentation test more than once but they were unable to test him due to insufficient samples. After our failed 3rd cycle, we were tested for MTHFR (which we both have) and have been on folate. \n\nNeedless to say, we haven't done any transfers except once with 2 day 3 embryos on our 2nd cycle. Our doctor really wanted to do a transfer for us but that failed. The embryos were grade C quality as they have been for most of our cycles - grade C or D. \n\nThis past cycle, I started taking vitamin supplements including coQ10 and we retrieved more oocytes than in past cycles (a total of 12 versus a max of 8 in the past). We got 8 embryos instead of our usual 5 or so. We had quite a bit of hope since we were told on day 2 (day 3 was a Sunday and the clinic was told) that we had one grade A, one grade B, and the other 6 were grade C embryos. Unfortunately, they all arrested before we could do a blastocyst transfer.\n\nSince failed cycle #3 and especially after this past failed cycle, our doctor has been pushing us to use donor gametes, and namely donor eggs. She is pointing to my eggs as the culprit and dismisses the idea of donor sperm. Obviously there are no tests to see if egg quality is good or bad, but does this seem normal to you? I mean I am getting older and am now 35.5, but still... If it is the egg quality that is holding us back, I will consider donor eggs, but the thing I don't get is that my partner has severe male factor infertility. This is a fact. Instead of automatically pointing to the eggs, why wouldn't it make sense to do an IVF cycle with donor sperm instead? \n\nI am fortunate to live in a country where the cost of IVF is mostly covered, so money is not an issue for us. I would of course love to become a parent ASAP and it's true that IVF with my eggs could fail again, which would set us back time-wise. However, if we use donor eggs anyway, we no longer will be 'racing against the clock' so to speak. \n\nWe are actually looking into going abroad for better quality IVF and potentially for donor eggs (the waitlist is too high where we live) so we'll see what our new team says, but I was wondering if anyone else had had a similar experience with severe male factor infertility, failed IVF, and a clinic that pushed for donor eggs vs donor sperm. \n\nThanks and have a great day everyone!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 20052, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "donor eggs for MFI / OATS after IVF failure?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ii1ww2/donor_eggs_for_mfi_oats_after_ivf_failure/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598602118, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ii35hv/friday_am_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ii35hv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Daily", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 46, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ii35hv/friday_am_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1598602129, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!

I am new here. My husband (32m) and I (30f) have been together for almost 11 years. We have been TTC since January 2020. That is when I truly began to track my cycles, ovulation, waking temps although we were pretty \"loose\" about it as of late last year. My husband has two autoimmune diseases (Hashimotos and Alopecia) so we decided we would have a semen analysis done after TTC for six months. My OBGYN agreed.\n\nWe got the results back and were told by my OBGYN that he has severe ogliospermia. OBGYN didn't get into numbers, but said IUI would be promising. Obviously a relief! We had our phone appt with the RE yesterday and she said that wasn't true. Based on his numbers and not knowing anything about me, IVF is going to be our best option. I do ovulate and get a period monthly, but you never know what could be going on that I don't see :\\\\ We are going to begin a whole IVF work up - bloodwork, testing, he will re-test his sperm, and meet with a urologist that specializes in male infertility.\n\nTrying to be hopeful, but find it hard. Many of my friends are pregnant and none have struggled at all. All have become pregnant within a few months of TTC. I am happy for them, but sad for me. I have that feeling of being on the verge of tears, but not actually being able to cry.\n\nI hope this time allows my husband and I to lean on each other more and better our communication, but the stress of the testing and unknowns hasn't been easy on our relationship. Not to mention, the pressure of work, the pandemic, and normal daily woes. \n\nI know I am not alone, but I feel that way. Really hoping for a positive outcome!

Essentially, chronic dieting and overexercise has messed up my brain so it doesn't tell my body to develop eggs or ovulate properly.\n\nOn the one hand, it's a relief to finally have a diagnosis. On the other hand, I'm furious because this is literally the first thing I asked my RE about 18 months ago. At that point I was exercising 1-2 hours a day and had been doing the keto diet for several years. My RE basically said it wasn't possible for me to have FHA because I had a normal BMI. He said it was likely PCOS, even though I didn't have any of the classic characteristics.\n\nBecause I thought I had PCOS, I doubled down on a super strict diet and exercise. This was the worst thing I could have done. I was doing fertility treatments but they weren't working well, and when I did manage to conceive I had a miscarriage due to a chromosomal abnormality.\n\nLast week I finally went to a new RE who actually looked at my entire medical history, and he thinks I have FHA. This definitely seems to match my symptoms more, and was what I already suspected after only a few months of TTC. Treatment is eat more, exercise less, and relax. \n\nI can't believe for the last two years I've been making myself crazy trying to improve my fertility and have been doing the exact opposite.

I met with the surgeon fairly quickly (within a few days) who believes that I need surgery ASAP this week. She does not think she will be able to spare my right ovary/Fallopian tube. I have no issues with the left (hopefully)... But I'm still distraught. \n\nI'm in a same-sex relationship, and I was hoping to start trying IUI this fall using donor sperm. I'll be 34 next month. I'm so sad about losing half of my eggs. Although we have money saved, finances are such a stress- we won't have unlimited IUI/IVF tries (it is not covered in our province and my insurance will not cover any of it). I am so sad and worried that I will never have the chance to be a mom. \n\nMy sweet wife is trying her best to be empathetic and kind to me... But I know she's not feeling the same kind of grief that I am. She has never wanted to carry a child, and would be happy with or without kids. Don't get me wrong, she wants to try too- but she knows she will be happy either way. I have wanted to be a mom forever, and can't imagine living life without children. \n\nI'm also so mad at myself for not knowing something was wrong, but I really haven't had many issues/symptoms. My periods are regular/normal, I had a pap 8 months ago- the MD did not feel anything astray with my ovaries. I have gained ten pounds this spring/summer, but I thought it was due to inactivity (prior to Covid, I had been going to the gym 4 times per week). I feel shell shocked. I went to see my doctor due to back pain- she didn't think there was anything going on either, but decided to do some testing to play it safe (and because she knew I was going to start TTC). \n\nTo top it off, three strangers have mistaken me for being pregnant this week. And I truly look like I am. I didn't 6 weeks ago, but now I look like I'm 6 months pregnant. It is growing fast, so my belly/hips are full of fresh, bright purple stretch marks. It feels like my body is playing a cruel trick on me. \n\nThanks for reading (assuming someone made it this far).

We have done 2 clomid +IUI cycles and are starting cycle 3. \n\nAfter reading through this wonderful sub and learning about all of the different procedures, lab tests, etc that others have had, I am worried my RE has not done enough evaluation. Am I overthinking it??\n\nWe have a diagnosis of unexplained infertility and are both relatively healthy. I have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism that has been controlled for &gt;1 year. \n\nIn terms of work-up, we've had:  \n1. Semen analysis - clinic said it was the \"best\" in terms of numbers their clinic has ever had. I will have to request the actual reports since I never remember the numbers after we leave the clinic. I'd like to compare his numbers to the guide to understanding semen analyses post.   \n2. AMH level of 10, which the RE told me was a good sign  \n3. HSG, which was quite a horrible experience, unfortunately. My RE had a very challenging time inserting the catheter and getting a good seal. So much cramping and sharp pains. I think they used about a liter of contrast and the whole thing took over 30 minutes. In any case, the report was \"Uterus is significantly retroverted. The endometrial cavity is normal. Left fallopian tube is normal and there is eventual spill.  Right fallopian tube is normal however there is no spill appreciated during the examination is may be related to inability to perform enough seal and pressure.\"  \n4. MMR/Rubella titers - immune\n\nAnd that's it.   \nAfter this work-up, we moved straight to clomid plus IUI.  \n1. Cycle 1: Clomid 50mg CD 3-7. US CD 10 which showed 4 follicles about 12-13 mm, US CD 12 showed three that were around 16 mm. We did estradiol levels and LH levels that day and were told I had not ovulated yet. My OPKs did not turn positive so trigger shot (ovidrel) CD15 and single IUI 36 hours later. No repeat ultrasound on day of IUI. Sperm count was good.   \n2. Cycle 2: Clomid 50mg CD3-7. US CD 12 with one follicle 18mm. No labs done this time. Ovidrel on CD 15 and single IUI 36 hour later. Sperm count good this day as well. At my request, I started progesterone 100mg daily vaginally two days after IUI. My clinic was sort of wishy washy on whether or not they would actually recommend progesterone, seemed more like they were just appeasing me.   \n3. Now on cycle 3. After discussion with my RE, she somewhat hesitantly agreed to increase my clomid to 100mg daily. My lining has looked fine during the previous two cycles. I'm day 5/5 of this course of clomid and have had some hot flashes, but nothing too bad.\n\nAs I said before, I'm just worried we have not done enough evaluation. My RE said there is no other evaluation she would recommend at this time. I mentioned hysteroscopy and she said there wasn't enough evidence to suggest that this would be helpful. I also asked about injections vs oral medication prior to IUI, and she was very much against injectables for me (due to cost and increased risk of multiples). I feel helpless through so much of this journey. Thank goodness for my spouse who has been wonderful through this all!!\n\nWe live in a medium sized city but the only other fertility clinic in town has horrible reviews. Our insurance doesn't cover anything to do with infertility so we are paying all out of pocket as well. \n\nI actually really like our RE, she's very nice and has actually given me her number and said I can reach out to her with any questions. I just worry we aren't doing enough evaluation- though I'm sure most couples with unexplained infertility feel like that at times. \n\nAny advice, thoughts, words of encouragement would be appreciated.   \nThanks for listening!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 20081, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Overall worried and questioning everything", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ij3hh4/overall_worried_and_questioning_everything/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lf025", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3hbpu957", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598761057, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ij6p16/post_iud_amenorrhea/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ij6p16", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ij6p16/post_iud_amenorrhea/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1598761068, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anyone else experienced amenorrhea after having an IUD removed?

To make things complicated we did IVF in Prague and due to covid I don\u2019t know when I can go back for my last ET (I\u2019m from the US). I have unexplained infertility, I\u2019m healthy, exercise regularly and try to eat healthy. \n\nMy question: Everyone in this group knows IVF is all so traumatic and can be so brutal on the body. Has anyone experienced body trauma due to all the poking, prodding, needles etc?  I\u2019m not even sure I can articulate exactly what I mean. But here\u2019s some examples:\n\nI went to a dental appt and they did a routine teeth cleaning and I cried while getting my teeth cleaned. Something about the hygienist poking my gums triggered my body to respond negatively (I was caught off guard and couldn\u2019t stop myself from crying). \n\nI had to get a biopsy of my breast to screen for breast cancer and cried during my appt. Same thing- the digging into my breast to get the sample make me weep. \n\nI had my 2nd saline sono last week and cried during my appt and after I sobbed in the car. All of these appt were uncomfortable and hurt but not so much that I would cry normally. Normally meaning I never cried in the past when having a medical appointment. \n\n (Like who cries during a teeth cleaning? Lol) \n\nI\u2019m clearly holding trauma in my body and I don\u2019t know how to exercise them out. I\u2019ve been to therapy in the past with someone who specializes in grief and infertility and it helped but not with the body trauma. I meditate, I exercise, do yoga but I don\u2019t know how to deal with the overwhelmingness of routine medical appointments. It always catches me off guard. \n\nMy friend recommended \u201cthe body never forgets\u201d.\n\nAny other people have recommendations? Is this something other people have experienced? I don\u2019t see a lot of conversation about it (if so please point me in the right direction). \n\nMuch appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 20102, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dealing with trauma in your body", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ijit4r/dealing_with_trauma_in_your_body/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SnooDoodles532", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3wahes2h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598816971, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ijj5vc/ttc_over_40_with_dor/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ijj5vc", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ijj5vc/ttc_over_40_with_dor/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1598816982, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 20104, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "TTC over 40 with DOR", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ijj5vc/ttc_over_40_with_dor/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "k80bear17", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_35nfguq7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598819605, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ijjxjl/its_my_25th_birthday/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ijjxjl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ijjxjl/its_my_25th_birthday/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1598819616, "score": 1, "selftext": "It\u2019s my 25th birthday, I\u2019m 5 days late (the first I\u2019ve ever been late) while TTC, now Ive just seen dark discharge when I went to the bathroom, and another friend is having a baby.

Each Pap smear or internal exam I\u2019ve had they tell me my cervix/uterus (either or, I can\u2019t remember) looks inflamed and that\u2019s it.

I felt so hopeful and had positive results when I started my cycle. This is my first IVF cycle. \n\nI\u2019m 42 years old. I was married when I was 39 and then my husband and I started trying but after 6 months because of my age I decided to see a specialist. He has low sperm count but on my side things were good. My AMH is 3.6. AFC is 22 on the left, 17 on the right. I\u2019ve been taking supplements for years now. I got a job that has infertility benefits. I practice yoga I don\u2019t do drugs. Eat healthy whatever. Had low vitamin D. \n\nI responded well to the medication. My E2 was 1200 day 4 and by day 8 it\u2019s was 4700. I only stimmed for 8 days. \n\nThey retrieved 22 eggs, 13 were mature and 11 fertilized with ICSI. 4 embryos made it to day 6 and were biopsied and frozen and then 2 more made it to day 7. \n\nI\u2019m just so upset and sad and devastated. Waiting for these results has been worse than anything else in this process. I thought maybe one at least. Everything else looked so good. It feels so unfair. 6 out of 6 seems so horrible. I hate that they just keep saying I\u2019m old. I know people my age have had healthy children. I can\u2019t stop crying. \n\nWhat do I do now? \n\nI have an appointment with the RE tomorrow. She went though the results but found it too painful to ask questions or understand. \n\nI just feel so lost. Between being furloughed since March and Covid and then having a glimmer of hope and joy of staring a family to these results today I just feel so lost. \n\nAny advice? Thoughts? Experiences?
