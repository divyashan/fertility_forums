This might sound crazy to be thinking about more IVF already, but focusing on the future is really helping me cope. The thought of a long wait before trying again is killing me.\n\nSo that said, tomorrow they will be sending tissue for testing to find out what caused the missed miscarriage and if anything else was off. Chances are it was \"just one of those things\" and there is no reason to suspect it would happen again (Please, Universe, give me that!)\n\nFrom what I've seen others say online, it seems you'd need to wait for either 2 or 3 cycles before trying again to let the uterine lining build back up after a D&amp;C. Makes sense. I don't remember a lot of what was said at the appointment but I do remember the RE said I could try again in 6 months, and when I freaked out at that, he said maybe sooner, let's just see.\n\nSo - first of all, I think I should push to do PGS, right? Honestly I'd prefer an IVF cycle that produced nothing than to go through an MC again.\n\nAnd if I do PGS, it would be a freeze-all cycle (pretty sure there is no lab close enough for fresh cycle). And if that's the case, it shouldn't really matter if my lining is back yet, right?\n\nHas anyone been through a similar thing? I'm only nervous about freeze-alls because we never had anything make it to freeze before. But I assume the 6 total embryos transfers we did do could have been potentially frozen instead. \n\nI'm clinging to the hope that we really do not need to wait 6 months and there is something to do before that. Any input appreciated. I posted our IVF history below. Oh, and I will be checking with a second clinic and possibly switching. Thanks!\n\nOur IVF history:\n\nI'll be 37 in September. No known reproductive issues, husband (39)has severe MFI. Did ICSI with testicle biopsy. frozen sample of sperm was used for IVF # 2. nothing left frozen\n\nIVF#1 - fresh cycle, 15 retrieved, 10 fertilized, 3 transferred on day 3, nothing made it to freeze\n\nIVF #2 - fresh cycle, 14 retrieved, 9 fertilized, 3 transferred on day  5, there was one other we hoped would go to day 6 and freeze, but no go. Singleton pregnancy/MC at 12 weeks.\n\n**update, in case anyone else goes through this**\nI had my D&amp;C this morning. I feel fine now, just still some bleeding. I was completely knocked out for the procedure, so no pain. I bleed a ton right after in recovery, but they gave me something for that and now it's just like a very heavy period.\n\nOne thing that was very difficult. This was supposed to happen two days ago. They gave me a dose of Mistoprostol to take (vaginally and orally) the night before. I took it on Sunday and went on on Monday ready for surgery - no go. It hadn't worked enough. Same thing on Tuesday/yesterday. Finally today it happened. I did NOT know this was a possibility and Monday was difficult, because I completely thought this would be over with. The reasoning for the delays ended up being that they wanted me dilated enough so that they could remove the entire sac intact, which is much better for genetic testing. So my advice for anyone that has a missed miscarriage and has to do a D&amp;C  - ask if there's a possibility of it getting delayed like I did. If I didn't work from home, that would have been really awkward to arrange.\n\nBesides that, being on the drugs for 3 days caused me light bleeding and very light cramping - nothing major at all. I've had way worse periods.\n\nDoc says he wants me to wait 2 cycles before doing any IVF again. We will talk about it next week at my checkup. I'm going to ask him why the hell he told me i'd have to wait 6 months on the day I found out - it made everything so much worse that day. At least this is better news now. After my next period, they will do karotype testing on both of us to make sure all is ok, and by then we should have the test results from today also. \nPraying that all that testing turns out ok.\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "more IVF after miscarriage - advice or experience welcome", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4mqau6/more_ivf_after_miscarriage_advice_or_experience/"}, {"author": "RamsBladderCup", "author_created_utc": 1379896322, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "36F | MFI | IUI#1 Aug 2016", "author_fullname": "t2_d93ix", "created_utc": 1465183868, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4mr11i/questions_to_ask_the_urologist_about_mfi/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4mr11i", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4mr11i/questions_to_ask_the_urologist_about_mfi/", "retrieved_on": 1472749877, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nMy husband has an appointment with an urologist that specializes in MFI soon.

Found after doing the genetic carrier testing that I'm a positive carrier for cystic fibrosis. Which is absolutely terrifying. Now my husband has to be tested for it, which he went today to do the blood test. If he is a carrier then we have to cancel this cycle and IVF will be our only option. But if he's not then we continue this cycle as planned. My prolactin levels were higher than normal so she wants me to take medicine to help bring that down. When I went to get the medicine, they said that particular medicine (Dostinex) isn't available unless it's ordered so now I have to wait for that. Waiting to hear back from the RE to see if I can pick it at another pharmacy. Also my AMH came back at 14.9. Really high, I'm told. But I don't have PCOS that I'm aware of. The RE didn't seem too worried about it. Just said that we need to be careful in stimulating my ovaries to reduce the possibility of multiples. \n\nLots of emotions. I went to therapy today and talked about everything that occurred and my therapist was impressed that I was still holding up. It was a rough session. I just feel like this is a lot. A lot to remember. A lot to deal with. I know others have it rough and I'm not trying to have a pity party but it just feels very overwhelming. Hoping that my husband isn't a carrier and we can just keep moving forward.\n\nI did have a question for you ladies who did Femara, did you find it better to take it at night or in the morning?\n\nThank you ladies and gents for being so incredibly supportive.

After the surgery, the doctor came to my recovery bed to let me know that I did indeed have endometriosis. Lots of it. Stage III or IV. He said I'd obviously had it for a very long time. That it has likely been the cause of our infertility.\n\n\nHe asked me, \"Haven't you been in pain?\" \n\n\nOf course I've been in pain. I've been in pain for 16 years.\n\n\nOnce in Jr. High my cramps were so terrible that halfway through the day I just laid down on a mat in the PE room and sobbed in pain until my mother could come pick me up. The next day when I came back to school my friends told me a rumor had gone around saying I'd died.\n\n\nThe diagnosis: bad cramps. My mom's OBGYN told me to take a couple of pain killers the day before my period started and to use a heat pad.\n\n\nMy freshman year of college I had to miss a final because the cramps were so debilitating that I fell to the floor after getting out of the shower and couldn't get back up.\n\n\nThe diagnosis: bad cramps. The RN put me on birth control so that I only had periods four times a year. \n\n\nAlmost 5 years ago, my husband and I decided to try to start our family. I got off birth control. The cramps weren't as bad as before but I had very painful bowel movements and even blood in my stool. Intercourse, especially at ovulation, became very painful.\n\n\nThe doctor said I had a cyst on my left ovary but it was nothing to worry about. No diagnosis. Just try not to have my husband penetrate deeply and make sure to drink water to keep my bowel movements smooth.\n\n\nA year and a half with infertility. Told the doctor about my history of painful cramps and pain during intercourse. The doctor's course of action? Track your temperature on a chart and come in when your temperature peaks for a PCT (for those of you who don't know: Post-Coital Test. The woman comes in one hour after sex, the doctor extracts semen from her vagina, and analyzes sperm mobility. But why would you know? Real REs and OBGYNs haven't used that test since the 90s). \n\n\nThe diagnosis? Mobility is a little low so let's do IUI without running any other tests. I didn't bother moving forward with him but we were students and our insurance was limited to the student health center. We had nowhere else to go.\n\n\nI tried holistic approaches. Lost weight. Ate paleo. Pelvic massages. Nothing.\n\n\nTwo years later I had a full time job with great insurance. I went to my old OBGYN. He knew my history of bad cramps. He knew about my cyst. He ordered blood work. Everything's normal. He ordered a semen analysis. Normal. He ordered an HSG. Normal. He says we have undiagnosed infertility and puts me on Clomid. No pregnancy but plenty of emotional mayhem. He tells us IVF is likely our only path to pregnancy.\n\n\nWe moved to Canada for my husband's PhD. Once again on student health insurance. I went to a walk-in clinic, hoping to get a referral to a specialist for infertility. Told them my symptoms. Same blood work. Still normal. Ultrasound: 4cm^3 cyst on my left ovary. Probably nothing. Undiagnosed infertility.\n\n\nI was desperate. I looked up causes of infertility online. I found the symptoms of endometriosis:\n\nPainful cramps: check\n\nPainful intercourse: check\n\nPainful ovulation: check\n\nPainful bowel movements/urination: check\n\nBlood in stool/urine: check\n\nOvarian cysts: check\n\nInfertility: check\n\n\nArmed with a self-diagnosis, I went back to the clinic, listed off my symptoms, and asked to be referred to a gynecologist. The gynecologist referred me to an RE who then referred me to a surgeon and that's how I ended up lying in that hospital bed a week and a half ago.\n\n\nThe surgeon said we have a good shot at getting pregnant without IVF now. But I'm angry.\n\n\nI'm angry at the doctors who didn't take me seriously as a young woman in pain.\n\n\nI'm angry at the doctors who were too lazy or incompetent to diagnose my obvious disease.\n\n\nI'm angry that it took ten doctors and five years to finally get surgery.\n\n\nI'm angry. They stole years of my life away. If I had been diagnosed before marriage, I might be wrangling a four-year old into bed right now rather than writing this post.\n\n\nNo offense to anyone here, but if I had been properly diagnosed I might have never had to belong to this shittiest of clubs. No one wants to be here. Everyone hopes they can leave this club behind.\n\n\nBut I'm grateful for you guys for being here. Infertility is so isolating but you people make it less so. You helped me self-diagnose what none of my doctors could. You gave me advice about my surgery. You gave me a place to vent my frustrations and voice my hopes. Thank you for giving of yourselves to make this shittiest of clubs a little less shitty. \n\n\nThank you.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My doctors stole years of my life", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4mxunp/my_doctors_stole_years_of_my_life/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1465293762, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4myb54/tuesday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4myb54", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 190, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4myb54/tuesday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1472754036, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

Although I hate having to be part of this club, I love the support and humor you guys provide in these difficult times.\n\nBackground Info:\nWe have been trying since October 2014, we are currently on cycle 16.\n\n**Me:**  28 years old, Diagnosed with PCOS at age 19, cycles have been wonky my whole life. With diet, exercise, better sleep habits and metformin, my last 3 cycles have been 30-35 days long and presumably ovulatory based on charts and OPKs. I'm very pleased by this improvement.\n\n**Husband:** 26 years old, healthy. We just received the results to his SA this morning.\n\n**Volume:** 1ml (Normal 1.5 - 5ml)\n\n**Motility:** 15% (Normal &gt;50%)\n\n**Sperm Count:** 5 X 10E6/ml (Normal &gt;20 X 10E6/ML)\n\n**Appearance:** Normal\n\n**Vitality:** 35 (Normal &gt;50%)\n\n**% Abnormal:** 65% (Normal &lt;40% morphologically abnormal)\n\n**pH:** Normal\n\n\nSo far we had assumed the problem was just my PCOS. In one sense I'm relieved that it's not all my fault. At the same time I know nothing about MFI, and what can be done to improve his sperm count/quality. We are barely digesting the SA results. At least he has some sperm, right? Our doctor has recommended IUI and referred us to a fertility clinic.\n\nI'm still hopeful for the future, but at the same time I feel a lot of anger about being dismissed by our doctors (\"Just lose weight! That'll improve your chances!\"), and my husband being rather dismissive during the process (He thought I was going over the top with charting and OPKs, but he's been more understanding recently). \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro: We are officially a double whammy.

We don't care if it's our DNA, or half, or none, or if we parent through adoption. We just want to be parents.\n\n\nWhat's the fastest way to make this happen? How long should we stick out IVF? For IVF multi round veterans, is there anything you wish you'd done differently? If we've paid for the 6 rounds, should we just do it (there is a refund option)? Only getting 3 eggs and having none of them make it just feels like it's going to predict poor success in the future. Should we cash out (it is an option at our clinic) and move onto a donor?  If anyone on here has experience with foster/ adopt in the US - is there a timeline or is it really just a crap shoot?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does a fast track exist?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4n6j4j/does_a_fast_track_exist/"}, {"author": "bartlit", "author_created_utc": 1463494682, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_y00ah", "created_utc": 1465418714, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4n794r/here_we_are_an_intro/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4n794r", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 30, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4n794r/here_we_are_an_intro/", "retrieved_on": 1472759254, "score": 8, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI've been reading your posts for a couple of months and credit to you all this is a very supportive group given the isolation we all feel .\n\nOur story (I'm the husband) - I'm 35, Mrs. B is 34.

I just want to get back to it as soon as I can - I feel so much better thinking about being able to try again.\n\nOur first 2 cycles were fresh cycles back to back - both times they transferred 3 embryos. First IVF was a day 3 transfer, second was a day 5. No PGS. First time had 10 eggs fertilized, second was 9, and we never had anything left to freeze. One of those second cycle Day 5 blasts was the one that implanted.\n\nWe are waiting on testing from that loss to see if there is some other issue going on we need to consider, so I know that could change things. But assuming it was considered a one-off thing, what would you push for if you were in my shoes?\n\nI have a feeling that my RE will suggest a day-5 fresh cycle again because it worked before. \n\nBut I'm leaning toward doing PGS. I'm 36 and now have had a mc, and I'm willing to do what I can to reduce my chances of ever going through that kind of heartbreak and loss again. I also would really, really like to have some frozen ones to potentially use in the future also. (obvs we all would!)\n\nBut then what worries me most is attempting to do a PGS/freeze all cycle and ending up with nothing ever making it to freeze, and making that mistake a few times. And losing more time, and more money....\n\nMy RE would like me to wait 2 periods before doing a transfer again, to let my uterine lining regrow after the D&amp;C. I'm going to ask him if that means that after 1 period, I could still do a freeze all cycle, since there is no option for transfer. That could make the decision for me at least for my next round, unless the damn vacation I had just booked for last 10 days of July makes me miss that cycle. Dammit.\n\nBesides that, I'm inclined to ask to do all PGS/frozen cycles moving forward. It pains me to think that could make it many more months before I get to the point of an actual transfer. But then again, I might thank myself later if we have tested embryos banked. \nOr, maybe I should still with what worked since a fresh cycle has been proven to work for me.\n\nI'm all over the place.\nSo, what would you push for? \n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "meeting next week to discuss IVF#3.

I know my wife reads this sub regularly but is too shy to post (hi honey).  We really like this sub though and appreciate all the fine folks here posting their stories, experiences, and wisdom.  I thought it was long past time to finally say howdy, especially since we're far along the IVF path now.\n\nWhat to say about our story?  I suppose we're like a lot of couples here.  I'm 34 (35 in a month), my wife is 33 (34 in September), and we've been married for coming up 5 years (together for 10).  We're busy professionals who have moved to 4 cities in 8 years.  We've always wanted children but for one reason or another, it just wasn't a good time.  We don't have any regrets about choices we've made and we're very happy people, but infertility did hit us pretty suddenly and surprisingly.  We would have tried earlier but my wife was hit with serious thyroid issues over the last few years, including radiation treatment which basically locked us down for two full years.\n\nWe were trying for a good year and it wasn't easy since I was commuting from another city on the other side of the continent but we definitely tried.  Predicting kits, temperature checks, etc.  We knew enough to know something was up and so we started seeing a REI.  Blood work, ultrasounds, HSG, and SAs later, we were diagnosed with \"unexplained\" infertility which was both disappointing and relieving.  Disappointing to have no idea what was wrong, but relieving to know it wasn't something extremely serious or end-of-the-roading.\n\nWe did two IUIs without success (learning that it basically gave us a 8% chance or 92% failure percentage) before deciding that we were going to move straight on to IVF.  We linked up with a new clinic on our REI's recommendation as she couldn't fit us into her schedule (and our schedule).  My wife was on medication and monitoring for pretty much all of May.  We had our retrieval on June 4.\n\nIt's been quite a roller-coaster since we started IVF.  In addition to the stress and anxiety of the monitoring process we also stressed about acquiring prescriptions (including getting a bunch from Canada as we're in the US).  Stressed about our chances with IVF.   Stressed about if and how to tell our friends and family.  You guys know the drill.  We were especially stressed when at the beginning of May our REI said we were looking at 10 eggs - 7 on one side and 3 on the other, also hidden behind a cyst.  We were worried that this was kind of low.\n\nWe got thrown a monster curve ball mid-way in the month too.  My wife tested positive as a carrier for a genetic condition which meant I would need to get tested too.  Three days before retrieval we got my results and I was also a carrier.  We calculated we had about a 1 in 1000 chance that we would both carry it (plus I also carry achondroplasia - yay) so we won a craptastic lottery.  This completely messed up our planning, including any chance of a transfer until any embryos could get screened (a few months).  \n\nFortunately, our retrieval went well. They managed to recover 19 eggs which kind of blew our minds given our original 10 count expectation.  The folks at our clinic were really wonderful and super kind to us.  I got to use a \"collection room\" for the first time.  That was an interesting experience.  The lab was right next to the recovery area so we got to see the embryologists immediately get to work doing their thing.\n\nThey called us later in the day that 12 eggs were mature enough to fertilize.  We got some good news a few days ago that they successfully fertilized 10 with ICSI.  We wanted to try and let me sperm fertilize it naturally but because of the biopsy requirement, it was only going to be ICSI (so as not accidentally biopsy a stuck sperm).  The day 3 assessment was 7 \"excellent\", 2 \"good\", and 1 \"meh\" (my word, not theirs).  Today is our day 5 and we're on pins and needles waiting to see what happens.  Since we need to do biopsies for PGD, it's so critical how many we've got left to work with.  My fingers are crossed...\n\nAt this point we're waiting to see how things go and then trying to make the next decision.  How many suitable embryos will we get?  Should we do another round of IVF (retrieval) before attempting to transfer?  Our thinking is that if we end up with only 1 or 2 embryos after PGD inevitably selects out the bad ones, should we try and get some more?  If we go right to transfer and we're lucky enough to get pregnant, do we base our try for another child on just one more embryo?  That will be at least another year later, meaning ovarian reserve is an issue...  Oh and I forgot to mention we are moving cities too.  Sigh...decisions.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post folks.

Anybody know if the movie Me Before You has any unfun baby/pregnancy stuff going on?\n\nSecondly, I had my baseline today and got the updated protocol. It figures that one of the monitoring appointments falls on a Saturday morning that I already have plans for. Backstory: I love running and have pretty much gotten all my girlfriends into running and 5k's. We do a lot of the fun ones together. Since starting all this IF bullshit in January, I've stopped running. Now, my friends are doing 5ks, triathlons, 10ks, obstacle courses, and all kinds of other fun things while I sit back and jab myself with needles. When a friend asked if I wanted to grab brunch after a 5k in my hometown, I said, \"Fuck it! I'm doing the 5k!\" So, I signed up and decided I'd walk it... maybe jog. And we got a lot more friends to sign up and join us.\n\nHere comes IF to screw it all up again. My first monitoring appointment is the morning of the 5k. I don't actually start stimming til two days AFTER the 5k and I'll start Clomid the night of. I emailed my nurse to see if I could possibly do the monitoring appointment the day before or after. Her short, quick response was that they don't recommend running during stimulations because...(you know the rest). I wrote back to point out that I won't actually be starting anything until after the race (unless Cetrotide counts...does it count?) and that I hadn't planned on running it anyway. I got no response and now it's the weekend. So, I have no idea if I'll be bailing on my friends and losing the money I paid or not. \n\nLastly, WHY do they make us pay for parking when we go to the doctor?!?! Especially the RE!

No medical journals or less reputable site has an answer so I figure I may try to see if you guys know of any possibilities that could be going on. \n\nLH (3.5mIU/ml) and FSH( 4.5mIU/ml) are low. I know typically in these cases either one is higher AMD another is lower. The things I've been reading don't sound fun since both of these hormones co!e from the pituitary. It doest help that my testosterone(doc never posted it and I can't remember the value but I'm taking aldactone 50mg twice a day for it) is high as well. Which would maybe say all of this is pcos but that wouldn't explain the low LH and FSH. \n\nOne possible theory that I have deduced is that over a year ago I had my last depo shot. Most sites state that it can take 10 months for that to wear off but it's been way past that. \n\nI'm extremely frustrated because none of this makes sense to me and I know 90% of all of the conditions that would be effected by anyone of these combos and the only answers i can think of is a jacked up pituitary or the worlds longest depo shot. \n\nSo I don't know and I would appreciate any insight what so over.

It's been this way since we moved here in January, though they've switched spots. They're not pushy, I've only ever noticed them engaging in conversation with people who seem interested, and they've never personally addressed me. But they have these two stands with booklets. One of them just says something along the lines of \"The Bible Saves\" or whatever, but the other one has \"The answer to all your life's questions\" written in large letters across the front.\n\nOn off days, I just want to go and shout at them. That 10 page booklet has the answer to all my big questions right? How on EARTH do you explain in under ten pages why we, two responsible twentysomethings who so desperately want to be parents, who have steady jobs, financial security, a four bedroom house and a social network, cannot conceive a baby for the life of us, while every day there are so many people who unintentionally fall pregnant, who abhor the idea of having kids, who are devastated and go through the trauma of abortion, or who keep the child but can't give it what it needs or even worse, who neglect and/or abuse their children? There is NO satisfactory answer to that question, or any of my other big life questions. Sure, you may have an answer like \"Because the universe sucks and wanting something really hard is not enough.\" or \"Because God is a moron that doesn't give a fuck about the happiness of humans.\" or even \"Because life isn't fair and crying about it won't change a thing.\" but you don't need ten pages for that.\n\nJust... They look so smug, standing there with their booklets with the answer to all of my questions. On days like today, it makes me want to rip them all apart. You have no answer for me. Go exist somewhere else please, stop being so in my face.\n\nEdit: I'm a bit calmer now, emotions are settling down again. I'm not angry at the Jehova's, if anything they're really respectful.  I'm just a monster of sadness and anger today. Anything could set me off. I so desperately want this to work and I'm afraid it won't. Checkup on Thursday had two 13 mm follicles, two 12 mm follicles, one 10 mm follicle, a couple of 9mm ones that might respond to stimulation, but that's a gamble, and three 6mm ones that are probably a bust. That's with maximum stimulation, because my AMH, while in the normal range, is really only just within that normal range. Quite low.
