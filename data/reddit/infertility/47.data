Some of the info is a little generic, but I do like the \"helpful tips\". I'm actually really impressed that my pharmacy put this together.\n\nConsidering the fires in the west, and the floods and hurricanes in the south/east, I thought it was a good topic. If anyone else has tips relating to fertility and disasters or other emergencies, please feel free to share.\n\n\nThis section has been provided by ______ Pharmacy to help you plan your actions in case there is a natural disaster \nwhere you live. Many areas of the United States are prone to natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and \nearthquakes.\n\nEvery client/patient receiving services should think about what they would do in the event of an emergency. Our goal is to help \nyou plan so that we can try to provide you with the best, most consistent service we can during the emergency. \n\n\n*Know What to Expect*\n\nIf you have recently moved to this area, take the time to find out what types of natural emergencies have occurred in the past, and what types might be expected.\n\nFind out what, if any, time of year these emergencies are more prevalent. Find out when you should evacuate, and when you shouldn\u2019t.\n\nYour  local  Red  Cross,  local  law  enforcement  agencies,  local  news  and  radio  stations  usually  provide  excellent  information  and tips for planning.\n\n\n*Know Where to Go*\n\nOne of the most important pieces of information you should know is the location of the closest emergency shelter. These shelters are opened to the public during voluntary and mandatory evacuation times. They are usually the safest place for you to go, other than a friend or relative\u2019s home in an unaffected area.\n\n*Know What to Take with You*\n\nIf you are going to a shelter, there will be restrictions on what items you can bring with you. Not all shelters have adequate storage facilities for medications that need refrigeration.\nWe  recommend  that  you  call  ahead  and  find  out  which  shelter  in  your  area  will  let  you  bring  your  medications  and  medical supplies, in addition, let them know if you will be using medical equipment that requires an electrical outlet.\n\n*An Ounce of Prevention...*\n\nWe  would  much  rather  prepare  you  for  an  emergency  ahead  of  time  than  wait  until  it  has  happened  and  then  send  you  the  supplies you need. To do this, we need for you to give us as much information as possible before the emergency. We may ask you for the name and phone  number of  a  close  family  member,  or  a  close  friend  or  neighbor.  We  may  ask  you  where  you  will  go  if  an  emergency  occurs. Will you go to a shelter, or a relative\u2019s home? If your doctor has instructed you to go to a hospital, which one is it? \n\n*Helpful Tips*\n\n* Get a cooler and ice or freezer gel-packs to transport your medication.\n* Get all of your medication information and teaching modules together and take them with you if you evacuate.\n* Pack  one  week\u2019s  worth  of  supplies  in  a  plastic-lined  box  or  waterproof  tote  bag or tote  box.  Make  sure  the  seal  is  \nwatertight.\n* Make sure to put antibacterial soap and paper towels into your supply kit.\n* If possible, get waterless hand disinfectant from a local store. It comes in very handy if you don\u2019t have running water.\n* If you are going to a friend or relative\u2019s home during evacuation, leave their phone number and address with ________ Pharmacy. \n* When you return to your home, contact ________ Pharmacy so we can see what supplies you need.\n\n*For More information*\n\nThere is much more to know about planning for and surviving during a natural emergency or disaster. To be ready for an emergency, contact your local American Red Cross or Emergency Management Services agency.\n\n*An Important Reminder*\n\nDuring any emergency situation, if you are unable to contact our company and you are in need of your prescribed medication or\nsupplies, you must go to the nearest emergency room or other treatment facility for treatment.

My RE recommends acupuncture to all of her patients, and I chose an acupuncturist from the handful of brochures and business cards in the clinic lobby. The consultation was free. The acupuncturist asked me to identify a goal, and I said, \"Never to have to do this again. I want to have the highest number of good-quality eggs retrieved.\" He said the three most important factors in egg quality are sleep, hydration, and protein. His acupuncture and supplement recommendations were:\n\n* one acupuncture session per week until retrieval\n* one session before and after FET (we're doing freeze-all)\n* B-complex (dosage unknown, as I didn't buy this supplement): 1 at breakfast for general prenatal supplementation and stress\n* ProOmegaD (dosage unknown): 2 at breakfast - general prenatal supplementation and egg quality\n* Antioxidant formula (vit C, E, and some other stuff - dosage unknown): 1 at breakfast, 2 at bedtime - egg quality (he said this was optional, since I'm already taking 500mg vitamin C)\n* Ubiquinol/CoQ10: 1 at breakfast, 1 at dinner - egg quality and circulation (my RE recommended 200mg daily)\n* DHEA: 50mg at breakfast - egg quality and count (RE recommended 150mg daily)\n* Royal jelly 500mg dehydrated (equivalent to 1500mg fresh): 2 at breakfast - egg count\n\nHis dietary recommendations were:\n\n* Drink 3 liters of water daily\n* Consume a lot of protein\n* Reduce or eliminate alcohol and all soft drinks, including diet\n* Consume minimal caffeine, sugar, and wheat flour\n* Keep a regular meal schedule\n* Have a high-protein breakfast (he recommended 2-3 eggs) without bread, fruit, or juice. Oatmeal is fine.\n* Have dinner *at least* two hours before bedtime.\n\nSleep stuff:\n\n* Keep a regular sleep schedule\n* Count 25-50 relaxed, deep breaths at bedtime (this really helped me go to sleep last night when all I wanted to do was browse the internet on my phone!)\n* At least 10 minutes of light exercise daily (stretching/walking). No strenuous endurance training. Keep it moderate at most. (I won't follow this and will continue doing hot yoga/barre whenever I can until stimming).\n\nHe said that if I was *really* intent on maximizing my egg count/quality, to do the following:\n\n* Eliminate all flour: wheat, coconut, almond, etc. \n* Eliminate high-sugar dairy (i.e., milk). He said cheese and butter are fine.\n* Go as low-carb as possible\n\nMy first acupuncture session was fine. He placed several needles on my lower abdomen, focused a heat lamp there, and passed an electrical current through them. This is meant to stimulate my ovaries somehow, or increase circulation to them. I was left alone in the room for 25 minutes with calm music playing. Now, I'm not one to take naps, and I even have trouble taking them on weekends and vacations. I was totally *out* within a few minutes, and I had a vivid dream of hanging out with Beyonc\u00e9 and our babies being friends.

My body was acting abnormally, giving me what I thought were signs of your creation and growth. My mind went crazy, running through everything I needed to do to prepare for you because it knew without a shadow of a doubt that you were there. \n\nI talked to you. From the moment you were introduced to me, I tried to do everything right. I changed my diet, eliminating anything that could potentially hurt you. I was kinder to my body physically, simultaneously increasing my exercise while reducing any strain I might experience. Even though your father was away at training, even though I had to put down my dog, even though my mind and heart were in so much pain and turmoil, I stayed away from anything that might chemically calm me. \n\nMaybe that was my mistake. \n\nMaybe I needed to take care of myself first. I was so concentrated on you, on this inaccurate gut instinct to protect this small, frail, nonexistent child I had (not) created. I know my emotional state would have affected you if you truly had been there. I tried to keep myself as calm as I could in order to create the most hospitable environment possible for you. It probably wasn't enough. My inordinate stress is likely what kept you from blessing us with your being. Yet even as I type these words, I know this is a ridiculous and untrue sentiment borne from grief. \n\nYou had a 25% chance of being created from the start. Any physical issues I may have only further lowered those odds, and I assuredly have a few. Even all my tissues and organs are perfect, I know my hormones levels and chemical makeup are wrong. I can barely keep myself surviving, so how can I have expected to grow and nurture you properly?\n\nMy certainty in your existence scared me towards the end. I thought of all the things I would be missing out on. I primarily focused on all the food and drinks I would be forced to abandon, because come on, it's me. I probably love food more than I loved the thought of you.\n\nAnd right there, that flippant remark... perhaps that's what did it. I didn't want you enough. I wasn't ready. I was (and remain) in love with the concept of you. I want everything good you could potentially bring to our family, but I'm not prepared for you as a whole, with all the negative things your life would bring. \n\nUltimately, I am fully aware there is nothing I could or couldn't have done to make you happen. It doesn't matter how much pineapple I ate, or if I created a Pinterest board dedicated to positive visualizations, or if I had meditated to remain calm, or if I never ingested anything cold ever again, or if I used a heating blanket (which the experts on the message boards assured me was a baby killer).\n\nSometimes things just don't happen. \n\n\n\n\nbut i still wish you would have.",

This is our first IVF and we're here because my husband has a blockage and needs TESE surgery retrieval to get sperm. Everything seemed cool with me. AMH 2.1, FSH 7 and everything looks peachy and they started me on the antagonist protocol with no birth control. They said to expect 10-12 eggs, lovely. \n\nBaseline u/s AFC was only 8. Upped my Gonal F from 200 to 300 (and stayed on Menopur 75) after only 4 growing on day 5. Went today on day 8 and still just 4 follicles. They were 1.3 - 1.5 in size. The doctor said I have a few options. I can cancel and hope that I'll have a higher AFC next time and they'll start me on much higher doses instead of waiting to see how I'll respond, and hopefully recruit more follicles. Or continue but to have my husband go through the pain and expense of the TESE surgery for 4 eggs might not be worth it. I then asked if I can harvest and freeze these eggs to add to our next cycle, and she seemed to think it was a lot of money for that but doable. We have great coverage for meds and paid less than a thousand for everything. \n\nCost wise (I'm in Canada) it will be $12,000 to cancel now and just do another cycle from scratch ($2.5k non refundable plus $9.5 k another full IVF/ICSI/TESE) plus meds, or convert this to a freeze all PLUS another full round with the TESE for $15k plus meds. \n\nWe've been waiting SO long to start this because it took forever to diagnose and treat my husband. Also due to scheduling we may not get to try again until Jan due to the urologists schedule for the TESE. I don't mind doing the egg retrieval twice and have already come this far I'm leaning towards freezing these 4 and doing another full cycle. We weren't expecting this today, I feel totally defeated. \n\nWhat would you guys do? Is there anything I can do to have more or better follicles next time? I'm a healthy weight, I eat well, exercise.. I don't know what else to do.\n\nEDIT: thanks for the comments everyone. They just called and they're cancelling my cycle. My chart will go into a chart review this week with all 6 RE's at my clinic and they'll discuss together what to change for the next cycle.

So, hello!\n\nI'm 30 and my husband (32) and I have been trying since June 2016. Like so many people, I was sure it would happen for us right away and spent that first year feeling increasingly sad and a little hopeless. I felt like we were doing everything right--I was confirming ovulation with tests and daily temping, my cycles were normal, we were timing everything right, etc. \n\nWe finally saw an RE in July and did all the testing ordered for us, my husband has had 3 SA's that all looked good, all my blood tests came back looking good, AFC at 18. The only oddity was low vit D levels which I'm now addressing through a prescription strength supplement. Then I had my HSG. The RE let me do it through my normal doc's office so we could save a little money. A week later I got the results back showing both my tubes were blocked.\n\nMy RE offered us two options--to repeat the HSG at their center so they could get the images not just the result and confirm the blockage, or go straight to IVF. She recommended the latter because she said a spasm on BOTH sides would be incredibly unlikely. I know this probably sounds silly but the idea of needing IVF completely broke my heart. I decided to repeat the HSG, basically just to stall the IVF convo, and went in the following week to get it done. Immediately after starting the NP doing the test goes \"You've got tubes, girl!\" They called me up the next day and told me to call back on CD1 to start medicated IUI.\n\nMy gyn also recommended acupuncture to me and I've been seeing this amazing acupuncturist for a couple months and she is so optimistic for us that with better stress management, acupuncture, herbs, and dietary changes like cutting caffeine, alcohol, and sugar that it can still happen naturally for us.\n\nMy girlfriends who know we're trying ALL (literally ALL, I'm not exaggerating) got pregnant on their first try and are so sweet and interested in what we're going through but mostly of the \"relax and it'll happen for you\" ilk. I went out on a limb and told my mom, who I'm pretty close to and is generally pretty supportive, and she responded with something along the lines of \"I'm so sorry honey, it'll happen for it just takes time--a year is not that long. I had three miscarriages, just be glad that's not what's happening.\" I know she meant well and I *know* how painful that experience was for her, it just felt sad for me to have her invalidate what I was trying to share. I don't know anyone in real life who has been through this.\n\nAnyway. I feel a little like I'm trapped in a limbo that's entirely my own making. My husband is amazing and will support whatever I want to do but he really does want to keep trying the old fashioned way. He is so optimistic that it will happen for us eventually. I can't get over the dream that it could still work and the bratty, spoiled, \"we-shouldn't-have-to-do-it-this-way\" feeling about IUI or IVF. Unexplained is such a mind fuck--I go between thinking \"something MUST be wrong and we should just start\" to \"there's nothing wrong and we've just had bad luck for 17 straight cycles\" about 10 times a day. I am also obsessed with the idea that if I were healthier--cutting any treats and caffeine and alcohol and carbs and blah blah--if I were as healthy as possible, it would work.\n\nHow do you give up on the idea that your body will find a way to work like it's supposed to?

These women\u2014so-called \u2018poor responders\u2019\u2014suffer persistently reduced success rates after IVF. Currently, no single intervention is unanimously accepted as beneficial in overcoming poor ovarian response (POR). This has been supported by the available research on POR, which consists mainly of randomized controlled trials (RCTs ) with an inherent high-risk of bias. The aim of this review was to critically appraise the available experimental trials on POR and provide guidance towards more useful\u2014less wasteful\u2014future research.\n\nMETHODS\n\nA comprehensive review was undertaken of RCTs on \u2018poor responders\u2019 published in the last 15 years. Data on various methodological traits as well as important clinical characteristics were extracted from the included studies and summarized, with a view to identifying deficiencies from which lessons can be learned. Based on this analysis, recommendations were provided for further research in this field of assisted conception.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe selected and analysed 75 RCTs. A valid, \u2018low-risk\u2019 randomization method was reported in three out of four RCTs. An improving trend in reporting concealment of patient allocation was also evident over the 15-year period. In contrast, &lt;1 in 10 RCTs \u2018blinded\u2019 patients and &lt;1 in 5 RCTs \u2018blinded\u2019 staff to the proposed intervention. Only 1 in 10 RCTs \u2018blinded\u2019 ultrasound practitioners to patient allocation, when assessing the outcome of early pregnancy. The majority of trials reported an intention-to-treat analysis for at least one of their outcomes, with an improving trend in the recent years. Substantial variation was noted in the definitions used for \u2018poor responders\u2019, the most popular being \u2018low ovarian response at previous stimulation\u2019. The preferred cut-off value for defining previous low response has been \u2018less or equal to three retrieved oocytes\u2019. The most popular tests used for diagnosing diminished ovarian reserve have been antral follicle count and FSH. Although the Bologna criteria for POR were only recently introduced, they are expected to become a popular definition in future \u2018poor responder\u2019 trials. Numerous interventions have been studied on \u2018poor responders\u2019. Most of these have been applied before/during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. The antagonist protocol, the microdose flare protocol and the long down-regulation protocol have been among the most popular interventions. The analysis of outcomes revealed a clear improving trend in reporting live birth. In contrast, only 10% of RCTs reported significant improvement in reproductive outcomes among tested interventions. Twelve \u2018significant\u2019 interventions were reported, each supported by a single \u2018positive\u2019 RCT. Finally, trials of higher methodological quality were more likely to have been published in a high-impact journal.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOverall, the majority of published trials on POR suffer from methodological flaws and are, thus, regarded as being high-risk for bias. The same trials have used a variety of definitions for their poor responders and a variety of interventions for their head-to-head comparisons. Not surprisingly, discrepancies are also evident in the findings of trials comparing similar interventions. Based on the identified deficiencies, this novel type of \u2018methodology and clinical\u2019 review has introduced custom recommendations on how to improve future experimental research in the \u2018poor responder\u2019 population.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Saturday Journal Club Topic: LFOR", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6z60fb/saturday_journal_club_topic_lfor/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1505034459, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6z7bl6/weekly_results_thread_0910_to_0916/", "id": "6z7bl6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 147, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6z7bl6/weekly_results_thread_0910_to_0916/", "retrieved_on": 1505129986, "score": 5, "selftext": "Welcome to the Infertility Results thread!

I've been doing medicated cycles for months now (and trying since February) but have only had one truly well-timed cycle that did not result in a pregnancy. I've made many more attempts than that but some were before the polyp was removed and the progesterone was corrected. Others just weren't timed well due to using a donor that is out of state and barriers such as shipping difficulties, planning trips to see him on very short notice, and lastly *his* vacation schedule &gt;:\\ \n\nI've basically turned into a bitter, angry, negative person because I'm so tired of missing cycles for other people's shit (like vacations. Grrrrrrrr!!!!!). I know he works hard and he deserves a vacation. I know I'm being irrational about it. That's why I know I can't do this anymore. SO and I went to see our RE last week to fill out consents to use a sperm bank and to discuss IUI vs. IVF. I feel such a sense of relief that I don't have to consider *anyone's* schedule but my own damn ovary's.  \n\nOur RE suggested trying a cycle or two of IUI since we haven't had very many well-timed cycles and also suggested a new type of IVF called INVOcell. \n\nRegarding IUI's.... according to her my potential for a pregnancy each cycle with IUI is about $14%. Each cycle is about $3000 including the sperm. To me, those odds just don't seem great and it makes me hesitate to try it given my overall odds. Is there anyone here who is content with their decision to try IUI first? I'm wondering how people who have now moved on to IVF feel about taking the time to do IUI's. Is the general consensus that it was a good experience or that it was a waste of time? My AMH is 2.66 which is good and my other labs were all in normal range. I ovulate every month and have responded well to Letrozole. My progesterone is in the 40's each cycle on lab day. Based on that it seems that I should be a good candidate for IUI. I have very little CM so that very well could be the problem (and I've tried the mucinex, drinking tons of water, etc.).\n\nThe second option she suggested was INVOcell IVF. Basically, I do a minimal stimulation protocol and go through an egg harvesting procedure. Following that, the eggs and the sperm are placed in a small capsule together which is inserted into me like a tampon. I basically incubate my own embryos for 5 days then I have the second procedure to place the embryo in my uterus (sorry, I'm new at this-- I don't know the precise term). Extra embryos are frozen for later attempts. The plus side is that the procedure is *substantially* less expensive than IVF. Altogether for retrieval and one attempt it's about $9000. She didn't tell me my exact odds but previously when I asked about my odds of conception she said 50% odds for IVF. So assuming it's the same for this procedure those are substantially better odds than IUI. \n\nMy concerns with this type of IVF is that it's new. It's just coming out of clinical trials where it was successful but I feel unsure about putting that kind of money down to be sort of a guinea pig. I read up a little on the procedure and most of the data I'm finding seems to be sponsored by the makers of INVOcell...That isn't reliable data because it's biased. I did read some personal blogs of women who used it and were successful. The one major downside to the procedure is that less eggs are harvested so fewer embryos develop. If I am successful on the first or second go, this is not too much of an issue--we are a one and done family. But if I have to undergo multiple IVF procedures then the risk of running out of embryos becomes a real consideration. \n\nHas anyone here heard of INVOcell or even tried it? I'd love to hear your thoughts. I am going to message my RE with these questions as well as ask her for research data that I can look over. This subreddit is such a wealth of information though so I'd love to hear some feedback from y'all as well. \n\nThanks so much!\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "INVOcell IVF?

He said I had my age on my side and in his opinion, age trumps AMH. Now that we've decided to pursue IVF to try to use my husband's sperm, I have to go (this morning!) to get an antral follicle count.

Does that mean my eggs have the quality of a 38-40 year old?! Also, I was reading that the test is usually done on cycle day 3, but my doctor wanted to combine this test with a hydrosonogram so we're doing this on day 5.  So on top of worrying about no eggs or that they'll look somehow worse than if I was actually doing this on day 3, there's the possibility a uterine polyp has returned and that will stall things by a few months because the polyp will have to be removed.  STRESSING.    ETA: So I guess I either just sensed something was awry, or at this point just expect things to go wrong because they keep going wrong... The doctor thinks there are a couple polyps in my uterus which I have to have removed before IVF.  Seriously, again???!!

It took me forever to find a place that cared about this and could do private blood tests to follow up on it.\n\nThey said my protein S levels were below the low limit and everything else they checked came back normal (and TSH magically went down from 2.9 a few weeks ago to 2.0 now, although totally different testing locations). But now there's some confusion because the doctor originally thought my last miscarriage was in February, and I just informed her that it was actually in early August, and she said this could have affected the protein S test result, because the value can go down during pregnancy.  So I probably need to get it retested again in my next cycle, when I will already have to decide to do IUI instead of IVF based on this result (I made the decision that if they actually found something obviously abnormal in my tests, I would do IUI again + recommended treatment; if nothing was found, I would ask to move forward with IVF). How long after pregnancy is long enough to test this and be sure that it's truly too low??\n\nDoes anyone else have any insights about protein S deficiency or been diagnosed with this? Did you have any symptoms in your daily life that were indicative, perhaps in retrospect, that you had a problem like this? The absolute only time I may have ever had a blood clot was when I was in my early 20s, once had my arm randomly blow up to double its normal size with fluid - it was truly scary looking and like that for weeks. The first doctor I saw freaked out and thought it was vasculitis.  She made me an emergency appointment with a vascular surgeon who was convinced it was a pinched vein that required surgery. I had a CAT scan, never heard from the vascular surgeon again, and the edema went down on its own shortly after the scan.  Anyway that's the only weird thing I've ever had that could in retrospect be related to this, other than having pretty clotty periods that became much more like liquid blood while taking baby aspirin. But I figured clots during menstruation is just normal?\n\nOn one hand I'm relieved that *something* abnormal was found and that it happens to be something completely treatable, even if it's taking daily heparin injections through my entire next pregnancy, should that be so fortunate to ever happen again.  But now I also have this big question mark of whether this is THE REASON for the two miscarriages.

I've been absent the last month because of an (incredible) vacation and personal time I've needed to process some bad news, but I'm getting to the point where I'm ready to jump back into the infertility world so I've got a flair update and a diagnosis update, hooray. \n\nTW: Miscarriage\nMy husband and I have been trying over two years.  I stopped birth control in August 2015 and didn't get my period for four months.  Then I got it every two weeks.  Then finally about 6 months out it normalized.  Great, I began using OPK's, then temping, trying to figure out when I was ovulating.  Never in my life have I had a positive OPK.  Temps all over the place.  My obgyn started doing progesterone draws on CD 21 and they were always less than 1, confirming no ovulation.  So we started with an RE July 2016, and I started ovulating! My insurance covered IUI's with meds with low co-pays which seemed amazing given how shitty infertility coverage can be.  I got pregnant with my 4th IUI and was so so happy.  Still the happiest 3 weeks of my life I can remember.  At the 7 week ultrasound the pregnancy was dating behind, with no heartbeat.  A few excruciating weeks confirmed it wasn't viable, but my body wasn't picking up on that.  I had a D&amp;C at about 11 weeks, and they confirmed the miscarriage was due to a trisomy.  \n\nI was hopeful I had got pregnant once.  I did 4 more IUI's.  2 with injectables.  All looked pretty textbook, although I've always been a bit of a slow responder to meds.  So I've done 8 total.  I want to scream writing that out.  I just felt like something else was wrong, and asked to have my fertility labs re-tested.  \n\nMy AMH dropped from 2.69 in July 2016 to .51 in August 2017.  FUCK! My FSH went from 5.69 to 10.1.  I got this in an email message from my doctor in the middle of France on vacation and spiraled HARD.  I might have drank an entire bottle of wine that night (it was delicious, the hangover not so much).  We had already been planning to do IVF this fall, but my mindset went from \"no guarantees but it will probably work for us\" to \"are we even going to be able to do IVF?\".  The internet was not my friend, I had to stop myself from googling too much.  \n\nSince we've been back I've talked to my doctor who made me slightly more hopeful, his opinion is that although my ovaries are in free fall IVF may still work and some reasons for hope are still my age, my high antral follicle count, and my documented good response to fertility meds.  So ok, there's that.  But his opinion is also that I've got a 6-9 month window to try to salvage whatever I can.  We've got consults set up in October, I'm trying to take this month off from worrying (yeah right) and just focus on being healthy.\n\nSorry for the long long post.  I would love to hear from other DOR ladies about their experiences with IVF... and also just from anyone who wants to throw all the middle fingers up at the sky at the continued bad news infertility seems to bring to some.

I'll be honest -- stimming and going through egg retrieval was actually helpful mentally because I felt productive, but going into a phase of zero meds and zero visits really depresses me.\n\nThanks for listening, y'all. :-(\n\n\nedit: grammar", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Benched and bummed", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6zjs4l/benched_and_bummed/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "maggie1987", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "30F | DOR | first IVF cycle Sep/Oct ", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1505189510, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1505225706, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6zko9d/introseeking_info_re_success_with_low_amh/", "id": "6zko9d", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6zko9d/introseeking_info_re_success_with_low_amh/", "retrieved_on": 1505274503, "score": 5, "selftext": "TLDR: 30F with uncooperative ovaries, low AMH &amp; 29M husband with good sperm - starting IVF, hoping to hear some low AMH success stories\n\nFirstly, I apologize - I am new to Reddit and I am sure that someone has made a similar post before, I'm just not sure how to find it.\n\nI've been off birth control since December 2015 and we tried on our own for 12 months before seeing RE#1. Immediately after coming off birth control I noticed my periods were fairly regular (26-29 days), super light &amp; that I had spotting 2-5 days before each full flow day. I seem to remember having spotting in late teens/early 20s as well but wasn't trying to get pregnant then so never thought much of it. Anyways, fast forward to Feb/March/April 2017 when my husband and I did a bunch of testing (including two monitored cycles for me) and found the following:\n1. Husband: Fairly normal semen analysis, slightly low morphology but otherwise fine\n2. Me: AMH 10pmol/L which is in the low ovarian reserve category for pmol/L. Normal FSH (&lt; 5) and two AFC in the normal range (22 and 16). Normal saline sonohysterogram.\n\nComically, after my first monitored cycle my periods went haywire, random 21-22 day cycles when I had never had such a short cycle in my life.\n\nWe moved and got referred to RE#2 who looked at my low AMH, my weird periods and very frankly said that our only good chance to have a child that is genetically our own is IVF as I \"likely have already used most of my good eggs\". She did a quick ultrasound that day and said she only saw 4 follicles (?!?) which painted an even worse picture. She repeated husband's semen analysis for shits and giggles and it came back gold stars across the board.\n\nAnyways, we're getting ready for our first IVF. It looks like we're doing a microdose lupron flare protocol. \n\nI got my period today so I started Marvelon which I will take for two weeks before starting microdose lupron morning and night with saizen in the evenings for two days - then will be adding Puregon 225 units twice a day until my first scan/blood work on stimulation day 7.\n\nWe've been told that we'll be lucky if we get 4 eggs...\n\nOk so here's my question (would greatly appreciate if anyone could direct me towards previous threads as well) - anyone out there with a similar story that can tell me about their IVF experience?\n\nThanks everyone, already finding this subreddit very helpful.\n\nEDIT: I've gotten some great feedback about where I might find some more information so I will check those out. I do apologize as I now realize that my query is insensitive - I've edited it a bit. I appreciate everyone's support, I've felt really lonely in this so far and it's nice to talk to people who get it.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro/Seeking info re: success with low AMH", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6zko9d/introseeking_info_re_success_with_low_amh/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "oh-no-varies", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "3 yrs, 1 yr medicated, tube surgery, 2 IVF, 2 ERA", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1505194215, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6zl0xd/psa_you_can_hide_parenting_related_advertising_on/", "id": "6zl0xd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6zl0xd/psa_you_can_hide_parenting_related_advertising_on/", "retrieved_on": 1505279096, "score": 20, "selftext": "So, having just returned to facebook, I was tightening up my privacy settings and noticed a new beta ad setting. \n\nIf you go to your settings, then Ads (on the right side menu) there is an option toward the bottom of the page titled \"Hide Ad Topics (test)\" which allows you to limit/hide ad topics related to either alcohol or parenting. \n\nSo, if you avoid facebook because you kept getting ads suggesting you be a surrogate while you were undergoing IVF like I did, this might make it a little safer to return (provided you still manually unfollow your obnoxious mombie friends).
