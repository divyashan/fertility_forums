Once she started she was able to determine it was clear mucus but she showed me on the ultrasound there was a LOT of it.\n\nThis cycle my baseline ultrasound at day 3 showed some fluid but they assumed it was blood and that I'd bleed more, I did bleed heavily the rest of that day. Our ultrasound to check follicle development day 11 she was again puzzled, there was less fluid but it was still there. She also had some concerns about the thickness of the lining and instructed me to start Estrace vaginally. They scheduled our insemination for the next day. \n\nDay of the insemination she noticed the Estrace had actually increased the amount of fluid confirming that it is mucus (and to stop the Estrace) but in general she seems stumped whether it's a factor in our infertility. She did get in a great joke asking the sperm to please not get lost in the swimming pool.\n\nShe's having me start progesterone a little early (today, 3 days after insemination as opposed to 7 as they normally recommend) as she believes the only danger the mucus poses is to implantation but I'm not super confident it's not a factor in more ways (and from her general confusion I don't think she's confident in her assessment either).

I am thinking that we might have to amp up an immune protocol in order for anything to stick. Here is some history:\n\n28F, 28M. Husband is pretty healthy besides some high blood pressure, but I have some medical issues.\n\n* 2009: Dx'd with ulcerative colitis, mild. Has been mostly controlled with medication with the odd mild flare up.\n\n* 2015: Dx'd with endometriosis. I wasn't told which \"stage\" i had, but I did have endo on my bladder, ovaries, etc. Lap in Spring 2015.\n\n* 2016: low-risk pregnancy and live birth (9 cycles TTC).\n\n* 2017: Discontinue birth control pills and begin TTC again.\n\n* 2018: OB ordered pelvic ultrasound and standard bloodwork, did 3 rounds of clomid. Unsuccessful. SA came back exceptional. Referral to RE. Did 1 IUI with Clinic 1. Unsuccessful.\n\n* Winter/early Spring 2019: OB did a lap. Found 4 spots of endo but nothing significant. Did 1 more IUI with Clinic 1. Unsuccessful.\n\n* Spring/Summer 2019: switched to clinic 2. Did 3 more IUIs with max dose of letrozole (6 follicles each time). Unsuccessful.\n\n* Summer/Fall 2019: took break from TTC - NTNP\n\n* January 2020: IVF using Micro-IVF protocol. Great response. 11 follicles retrieved, 6 mature, 6 fertilized with ICSI, 4 made it to blast. Wasn't told grades but told all embryos were of the highest quality and looked great. No PGS/PGD testing. Fresh transfer of 1 embryo resulted in chemical pregnancy - beta was \"1\".\n\n* February - April 2020: on BC pills to manage endo in between transfers at my request.\n\n* May/June 2020: FET with two embryos - protocol included estrace, PIO (started 6 days before transfer), doxycycline (started two days before transfer, continue for 5 days), prednisone (started two days before transfer, continue for 5 days), HCG wash (two days before transfer), lovenox (started day after transfer until beta). 5dp5dt I developed hives out of nowhere, controlled with combo Zyrtec+Allegra. Resulted in CP#2, beta was \"1.7\".\n\nA different doctor than my normal one (its a practice with two REs) called with beta results and said the only thing we could really do next time is a hysteroscopy, which I honestly don't want to do because I don't think it will help.\n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. Immune panel? Intralipid infusions?\n\nI want to set up a WTF call with my normal doc but I don't honestly know what to ask for. It doesn't sound like they have any other ideas for me so I want to come with questions/suggestions myself.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nEdit: also want to add that we will not be doing another retrieval, so this is the end of the line.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18513, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Protocol for last FET", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hf1wdp/protocol_for_last_fet/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593025506, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hf75lb/wednesday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hf75lb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Daily", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 153, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/hf75lb/wednesday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1593028411, "score": 2, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!

So I am on the first day of lining prep for FET 2. We did a freeze all in April because of covid. I was surprised by my clinic\u2019s protocol on freezing/thawing as I have lurked this sub long enough and never read about this method. So I was curious to know if anyone had the same experience with this protocol. So my clinic freezes embryos at day 3 no matter the quality, which I found odd as I mostly see people saying that clinics usually freeze at day 5/6. As a result I had 9 embryos to freeze, which they said will be frozen in 3 groups of 3. And for a transfer they will thaw one group, and see how many survive and grow to blasts, transfer the best and freeze the rest again if there other good blasts left. I wasn\u2019t worrying because I thought out of 3, statistically 1 will make it and the others won\u2019t, but they actually all grew to blasts so they transferred one and froze the 2 others. Now I am getting worried about thawing embryos multiple times and taking the risk to lose embryos or damaging the quality too much. I chose for my first to transfer only one. Now I am worried to \u201cwaste\u201d good quality embryos if I don\u2019t use them after the first thaw. Do you know what I mean? They will work again for FET 2 on a new batch of day 3 embryos, saying that it was better. For the second batch, if more than one make it to blast, should I transfer one or 2? Transferring 2 honestly freaks me out. I have to say also that they are not PGS tested. Anyone had the same experience and can give me some insight? Do you think my two day 5 blasts frozen at day 3 then day 5 will still be useable ? At age 35 I feel that every embryo counts, I am not thrilled at the idea to repeat a retrieval after 35, knowing the quality will likely drop as I get older.

I am mostly a lurker here and am more active over at r/stilltrying, but you all are some of the smartest and most thoughtful people on the Internet, so wanted to post this here and hopefully get some of your alls perspectives! I also posted this at stilltrying, apologies for people who are active in both!\n\nA few weeks ago I posted [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/16/expect-baby-bust-not-boom-coronavirus-pandemic/?ncid=newsltushpmgnews) (about how the pandemic will lead to a baby bust, not a baby boom) on twitter and wrote out a long, bitter twitter rant about how dumb the \"covid baby\" concept is, how it flies in the face of logic, and how it assumes perfect fertility and how that seriously sucks for those of us with infertility who are working so hard to get and stay pregnant, even now during a pandemic. Today a journalist messaged me saying she saw that thread and asking if she could interview me for a piece she's working on about family planning during the pandemic.\n\nLike most of us, my husband and I made our plans and started trying well before the pandemic started, and it hasn't changed anything about our intentions. We were still in the testing phase when clinics were closed, so we were a bit delayed in getting things rolling, but they opened more quickly in our state and thankfully we've been able to start treatment.\n\nFor us, we have the exact same plans around trying to have a baby as we did before the pandemic. It hasn't changed anything for us (outside of logistical things like closed clinics and partners not being allowed into appointments, etc.)\n\nAlthough I'll be making it clear I'm just one infertile person and don't speak for all of us, I want to do a good job representing us, as we are so often made invisible and this seems like a chance to bring us to the forefront of this conversation! My feeling is that most infertile people have not decided to put off trying/treatment purely because of the pandemic (which is different than being forced to because of closed clinics) but that's an assumption on my part.

I am 30F and husband is 35M.\n\n**We did all the tests:** so far we have low morphology 2% but RE said it's not an issue since his other numbers are high enough. \n\n**My tests** were all fine except for having Chronic Endometritis which I am currently treating. \n\nAlso, I don't have the best FSH for my age, but technically it is within range. \n\nWe are starting a natural IVF cycle, and we were advised that it is the best option for us: that if we are not pregnant within a couple of cycles then something is wrong. I should add, I'm an American living in Switzerland and the hospital is a research hospital. The Doctor there- kind of started pushing for natural IVF cycles because they believe some women should not be stimulated if they do not need to be. I like the idea and I am willing to take the low chances..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Questions:** first they are not redoing the Hysteroscopy to check if the Endometritis cleared. She said it is too rare, and another procedure will just put me in the risk of having it again. \n\nThe other thing is: I have really low-grade inflammation that can not be attributed to anything. Done a bunch of tests a couple of years ago.

It totally sucks on top of our severe MFI diagnosis. But now I'm lost at what to do?\n\nMy first major flare up lasted 3 months and was brutal. I wasn't taking NSAIDs at the time because I didn't know what it was at first and I was avoiding anti inflammatories due to trying to conceive. When I realized it was an autoimmune disorder I started Naproxen and within days the inflammation majorly calmed down. I don't yet qualify for biologics, so I'm stuck medicating with anti-inflammatories which are obviously no good for ttc. I basically use the Naproxen for about 5 days after I get my period and then stop. So I am more or less toughing it out and managing with stretching, hot baths, and ice. Some days it's okay, other days it sucks.\n\nIs there anything meds that I can safely take for the inflammation while still ttc? (Not biologics). If I have pain/inflammation but my CRP levels are still normal is that an acceptable level of inflammation for getting pregnant? I know our chance are low with my husband's MFI, but I dont want to have too much inflammation if it does happen. But I also dont want to take nsaids because of the risk. I feel like im stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nTLDR: Have an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation. I dont qualify for biologics. Anti inflammatories are a no-no for ttc, and I need strong ones (ibuprofen dont do jack). Will the inflammation in my body stop us from getting pregnant?

Quick intro! I\u2019m 29 and have been ttc for 24 months with not a single pos.

And one said I could maybe use the lowest dose of Methimazole, but I didn\u2019t have to. Fast forward to starting at our new clinic (we moved states) they are super excited we\u2019ve had all this testing and said we could start IUI next cycle! But then they call me the next day and told me I need to start on the thyroid medication before we do any treatments. Cool, got my old endo to prescribe it (waiting to get in with a new endo). Picked it up yesterday and started reading the warnings. It says not to use in the 1st trimester. Excuse me, what!? I\u2019m so confused and lost and I can\u2019t get ahold of any doctors till Monday. Why would my endo give me someone I can\u2019t take if I get pregnant?

The sample size is small, but I thought it would be helpful for those who are on the 'to GH, or not to GH' fence.\n\nhttps://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03004-9", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18589, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A growth hormone study on patients with poor embryonic development", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hgvbp1/a_growth_hormone_study_on_patients_with_poor/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lhn0005", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3j5monab", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593271845, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hgvjb9/femara_gonal_ovidrel/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hgvjb9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/hgvjb9/femara_gonal_ovidrel/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1593273202, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello!

We've been trying to conceive actively for 2 years, with a few years of casually preventing before that.

My RE says to basically expect IVF after a few rounds of IUI, and implied that the IUI probably wouldn't work. I've been reading through the wiki to learn more about the diagnosis and treatment options, but I'm a bit overwhelmed with everything right now. \n\nFor those who have a DOR diagnosis or otherwise are better informed about it than I am, is  a DOR diagnosis based only on pretty significantly low AMH (.08) meaningful? I have normal FSH and historically low Vit D, though my RE didn't check or ask about that. \n\nI have an ultrasound planned for CD 12 to determine timing for the trigger and IUI. Should I still be  temping and/or doing OPKs during this time, or are those no longer necessary since I'll be monitored by the RE?  Also, my temp has been higher than normal all cycle so far; does Clomid cause that? Also, I usually ovulate on CD 11 or 12, and my ultrasound to check follicles is on day 12. Does the Clomid delay ovulation, or should I try to get an earlier ultrasound? I know there's some information about changing protocols for those who historically ovulate earlier, and I'm trying to figure out what all may apply to me. \n\nI can tell I'm spiraling a bit here, so thanks for any guidance you can give.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18606, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trying to Understand My New DOR Diagnosis", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hh29pi/trying_to_understand_my_new_dor_diagnosis/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "luvmountains123", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6ff1aeqp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593317324, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hh80pa/how_important_are_the_published_cdc_art_stats/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hh80pa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/hh80pa/how_important_are_the_published_cdc_art_stats/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1593322755, "score": 2, "selftext": "So I'm well into the process with my current fertility doc (eggs retrieved, just did my first frozen transfer on Friday), but I've recently found out that his published success rates are lower than the other local docs in the area.

If you're on mobile you can find this under \"About Community\" at the top of the page (look for the three dots in the upper right corner).\n\n**Mention of pregnancy or positive results** post treatment is only permitted in the results thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Results%22). Vague and sensitive mentions to \"success\" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies \"I had success with A,B,C\"). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.\n\n**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses \"blessed\", \"miraculously,\" \"easily conceived\", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.\n\n**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.\n\nThis is a **science-minded, realistic, and sometimes cynical sub**. There are many communities online for people who want a more \"positive\" or \"upbeat\" experience complete with baby du$t.  People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic, and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies/cures as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).\n\nSex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. **Infertility isn't cute**, and neither are the terms we use. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.\n\n**No solicitations** will be allowed for monetary or medication donations. To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed.\n\nIf you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button. The \"report\" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment. Reports are anonymous, but selecting a reason is very helpful context. This will help us to actively moderate this community and makes it easier to catch posts or comments that break our rules.\n\nAs always, we are so proud to moderate this amazing community of strong, diverse and compassionate people.

I have struggled with fertility for the last 3 years officially but been trying for over 7. \n\nI have known my husband and his family over 15years (were friends before then been together 9 years) my husband is over 10 years older than me meaning one SIL let\u2019s call her A is 8 years older and one SIL say call her B is my age.\n\nSIL A has 3 children I do not mind these children but would not say I had a super close bond (my husband does) this SIL was married over 10 years and marriage fell apart the year we got married (3 years ago) I checked in a lot on SIL A and we became close. Turned out her Ex was pretty emotionally abusive and I even more than my husband became a support to her and help with the kids where can (they live 2 hours away)\n\nSIL B and I as far as I knew have never had an issue. She knew our fertility status and I have made effort. She got married a month after us (this was not an issue) but meant I could not go to her hen do as I was on honeymoon. She didn\u2019t even respond to my bridesmaids about mine but I overlooked it. Although as their mum has dementia and could not go to her hen do I felt bad (my dad died of a brain tumour when a teenager and I know the pain of watching a brain deterioration) I arranged a separate lunch just SIL B, SIL A, MIL and me. I made little party bags etc. \n\nMy wedding was lovely all got on and SIL B\u2019s was lovely month later. \n\nLast year I finally succumbed and had IVF both SIL knew this, it ended in an early miscarriage SIL A then became my support and again we just get on SIL B said very little. \n\nMy husband had a milestone birthday last year. I struggled all year with my loss but put my heart and soul into that birthday. I had contact with both SIL\u2019s throughout. They were involved with the celebrations.\n\nLong story short SIL B announced her pregnancy the weekend of his birthday. An announcement that came from no where and she had never spoken of children before (just to say most my friends have always given me a heads up might be on the cards due to my situation. It\u2019s not a rule but a nice thing) I am an active \u2018Aunty\u2019 to a lot of my friends kids!\n\nAgain long story short I went to therapy as I just hated her and felt it was cruel (the way she announced not the pregnancy). SIL A again was a massive support and understood. \n\nSo SIL B had her baby in December due to me recovering from an emotional breakdown not completely because of her but was linked, Covid etc I have never met this baby (I have never stopped my husband was his choice). Through advice from my counsellor I finally took courage to contact her and explain my feelings and TBF she owned it. She was very sorry and knew she made a terrible mistake, she also said she thought I hated her for years (which baffled my husband and SIL A) I have never been mean etc. She did again own this and felt sorry. But by this point I did kinda hate her!\n\nSo now I have her trying to be a friend and I still feel kinda crap about her. I have sent the baby clothes and a card etc but I just cannot see myself wanting to be apart of his life but mainly due to his parents. SIL B is trying to be friends but I just can\u2019t feel it, I do understand but she made a shitty decision and thought I hated her for over 10 years and said nothing! I have hung out with his family many many times! Also when even trying to be nice she has an insensitive way of saying things both my husband and SIL A say this.\n\nAnother friend has had a baby in this time and I love him. She was so kind and sensitive with her announcement it genuinely became happy news and I love seeing him.\n\nI am travelling to see my friends baby in person for first time this week (they live 2 hrs away) and then SIL A as we genuinely get on. \n\nI love a good photo and Facebook post and worry SIL B will see and ask why not made that effort for her and her baby. In all honesty I struggle with her not the baby I can\u2019t judge him! I just do not want to see her, I do not mind her but do not want to see her unless a family event. I would not go out my way to see just her (she lives closer than my friend and SIL A)\n\nI just feel well I know she expects us to be a doting uncle and aunt and we are not likely to be and it\u2019s sad really all round. But she never made effort before and thought I hated her for years then through her actions I did! \n\nMy husband is pretty equal with both but tends to see SIL A more, I make plans he is an easy life man but he has struggled with the fertility issues and he did not agree with his sisters decision of how she told us. \n\nI just feel shitty for this kid, what do I do?\n\nEdit gramma sorry on phone", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18638, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I might hate my SIL due to pregnancy announcement", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hiassq/i_might_hate_my_sil_due_to_pregnancy_announcement/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BeautifulVegetable8", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6afjvs3e", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593471650, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hib01z/multiple_chemical_pregnancies/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hib01z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/hib01z/multiple_chemical_pregnancies/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1593474088, "score": 0, "selftext": "Hi all.

Can I get the medicine from it somehow or is it now wasted? \ud83d\ude41 I still have like 500IUs left in it. \n\nThanks in advance!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18666, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Gonal F pen pulled out too early :(", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/himaxl/gonal_f_pen_pulled_out_too_early/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "noble_29", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ok7yzqi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593521422, "crosspost_parent": "t3_hi9j8o", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "noble_29", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ok7yzqi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1593495745.0, "created_utc": 1593466945.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.legaladvice", "downs": 0, "edited": 1593467129.0, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "id": "hi9j8o", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "dd649e82-aad5-11e3-b03c-12313d053130", "link_flair_text": "Medicine and Malpractice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": true, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_hi9j8o", "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 72, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "permalink": "/r/legaladvice/comments/hi9j8o/fertility_clinic_transferred_the_wrong_embryo/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 7, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "removed_by": null, "removed_by_category": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 4919, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I am 100% in shock and completely livid right now.\n\nMy wife and I are going through IVF right now  trying to have our first child.
