Never late, missed, had consistent periods, etc. At the urging of a friend I spoke with my ob and told him that... which ended up being cause for concern. Husband tested - fine, I had a blood check and was told blood work showed not ovulating. Did a round of clomid told \u201cI had great levels, take a pregnancy test...\u201d which resulted in a negative. We ended up moving, switched drs and immediately started to see an RE. RE say my blood work, had OPKs showing LH surge all indicated I am ovulating. Husbands test results described as \u201cRambo\u201d \ud83d\ude48. Had an HSG (worst thing ever) and those results were fine. Diagnosed with unexplained infertility. Had one round IUI one 50mg clomid that failed. Will be trying again next month for IUI. DR. Said you can do about 6 before moving to IVF.  So there is my story for now....will post my odd and gross question later!

For women trying to get pregnant from 20-35, the one year mark is usually when it is recommended to seek treatment if pregnancy has not been achieved. For women age 35 and older, the timeline is 6 months.\nUnexplained Infertility is a diagnosis given after standard medical investigations have failed to find anything abnormal. (These tests include - semen analysis, checking fallopian tubes to make sure they are not blocked, and confirming that a woman is ovulating)\nUnexplained Infertility affects 25% (or 1 in 4) of infertile couples.\nUnexplained Infertility is a diagnosis that can be applied to women who\u2019ve been pregnant before, and those who have not. This can include previous pregnancies that have resulted in miscarriage, stillbirth, live birth. \n\n**Tests you will likely have done to determine you are Unexplained Infertility**\n\n\nTo be diagnosed with Unexplained Infertility, several tests will be conducted on you and your partner to determine if there is a hormonal, structural or other health concern that is causing you not to become pregnant. \n\n\n**Semen analysis** - In a nutshell, is there sperm and is there enough of the right quality? (Better explanations are provided in the FAQ!)\n\n\n**Hysterosalpingogram** (Or HSG because that\u2019s one hell of a long word) - This is test to determine whether your fallopian tubes are clear. If they are not, if they are blocked, then that is a reason why pregnancy may not have occured. If they are clear, it is determined to be \u201cnormal\u201d. (Again, better explanations are provided in the FAQ)\n\n**Hysteroscopy** - This is a test where the uterus itself is investigated. Are there polyps, a septum, fibroids or perhaps a bicornuate or other unexpected shape to the uterus present?\n\n\n**Ovulation** - Is the woman ovulating? Clinics may confirm this in a variety of ways - women with regular cycles who\u2019ve been recording basal body temperatures and charting them may be as much proof as an RE needs. (Please chime in on how your RE confirmed you ovulated!)\n\n\n**Blood work** - Ideally, your AMH levels (Anti-Mullerian Hormone) should be checked at this stage, to make sure that you do not have diminishing ovarian reserve.\nOther blood work may be ordered - This could included markers for celiacs disease, thyroid hormone checks, iron levels, etc. It seems to vary by practitioner what will or won\u2019t be ordered. \n\n\n**Primary vrs Secondary Infertility**\n\n\n**What is Primary infertility?**\n\nPrimary infertility refers to a woman who has not been pregnant at all. This means no chemical, no miscarriage, no stillbirth, no livebirth. This is not a hugely important difference, but it comes up from time to time in scholarly literature. Thus, a woman who has been trying for a year, never had a positive pregnancy test, with \u201cnormal\u201d test results would be given the diagnosis of \u201cPrimary Unexplained Infertility\u201d.\n\n\n**What is Secondary infertility?**\n\n\nSecondary infertility refers to women who have been pregnant before, but are now unable to get pregnant in the expected 1 year. What \u201ccounts\u201d when we say pregnant before? \nChemical pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and livebirths. You can be a childless woman but be diagnosed with secondary unexplained infertility if your medical history includes several miscarriages. \n\n\nAdded bonus - You know how you\u2019re discussing your really depressing fertility history with a health care provider, and all of a sudden they light up when you mention you had a miscarriage? And then they say something like \u201cOh! So you\u2019ve been pregnant before! That\u2019s great!\u201d and smile like somehow the miscarriage was a happy occasion that all should rejoice over?\nTurns out that statistically, having been pregnant before increases your odds of getting pregnant again by 1.8 times. (You are 1.8 times more likely to get pregnant again)\nHowever, miscarriages are still super depressing, and this statistic doesn\u2019t change that. :/\n\n\n**So now that I have this diagnosis, what should I do?**\n\n\n**Expectant Management**\n\nHave sex. I know that no one wants to hear that after a year of optimistic rose-coloured lensed love making, followed by timed intercourse, followed by designated fucking days, followed by despair driven forced sex as dictated by some stupid app on your phone\u2026 but the science seems to indicate that long term, most folks with Primary or Secondary unexplained infertility are likely to get pregnant without any help. Seriously! \n\nHere are some papers to back me up:\n\n\n(NB: Scientists refer to have sex to get pregnant as \u201cExpectant Management\u201d, which is nowhere near as descriptive as \u201cFucking with purpose\u201d or \u201ctrying for a free sex baby\u201d, but I suppose we can forgive them)\n\n\n[Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial (2008) ](https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a716)\n\u201cIn couples with Unexplained Infertility existing treatments such as empirical clomifene and unstimulated intrauterine insemination are unlikely to offer superior live birth rates compared with expectant management.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Unexplained infertility: overall ongoing pregnancy rate and mode of conception](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/26/2/360/595834)\n\n\u201cOverall success rate in couples with unexplained infertility is high. Most pregnancies are conceived spontaneously. We recommend that if the pregnancy prognosis is good, expectant management should be suggested.\u201d \n\n**Exceptions to the just go have sex approach**\n\nIf you are age 35 or older, have diminishing ovarian reserves, or have some other reason why time is very much of the essence, expectant management may not be recommended. This is definitely going to be something your doctor discusses with you, to find the optimal route for you and your fertility. \n\n\n**But I\u2019m so tired of just having sex\u2026** \n\nYes. I am deeply sympathetic to this, and I hear you. \nBy the time you get a unexplained infertility diagnosis it seems like you\u2019ve been waiting forever. Finally you get an appointment with an RE, a fertility clinic, someone who\u2019s going to run tests and figure out why things aren\u2019t going the way they were supposed to. You get your hopes up, this all feels like steps forward! Finally!\nThe tests come back, the answers are all positive, and then you\u2019re told to just go back to doing that thing that hasn\u2019t worked yet. \nIt\u2019s very discouraging. It\u2019s hard to feel good about that.\n\nTurns out that\u2019s pretty normal. \n\nFrom the [Clomifene Study](https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a716)\n\u201cMore women randomised to clomifene citrate (94%) and unstimulated intrauterine insemination (96%) found the process of treatment acceptable than those randomised to expectant management (80%).\n\nThe [Hunault prediction model](https://www.freya.nl/probability.php) helps me feel more optimistic about our longterm chances.\n\n\n**What if I don\u2019t care about all those studies and want to pursue some sort of treatment anyway?**\n\nWell I for one am not going to tell you how to live your life! \nThe best caution against pursuing IUI, IVF or drugs is probably cost. Maybe IUI is covered for you. Maybe the benefit of doing something is more valuable to you than the cost. These are all individual decisions that you will have to make. \n\nStudy that discusses this:\n\n[Overtreatment in couples with Unexplained Infertility](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/30/1/71/682326)\n\n\nEdited to add more stuff from everyone's comments. :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8099, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Unexplained Infertility-What the heck is this diagnosis?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/89jtun/unexplained_infertilitywhat_the_heck_is_this/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "Chrysanthemum12mum", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1522806374, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/89l3rl/weirdgross_question/", "gilded": 0, "id": "89l3rl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Advice"}], "link_flair_template_id": "1ae87cfc-92a6-11e4-8e5a-22000b26873e", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/89l3rl/weirdgross_question/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1522851008, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 0, "selftext": "I have a weird/ gross question that I am nervous to google thanks to all the porn that could come up with this....

In the interest of keeping this \"to the point\" I'll start off with a brief recap.  TTC x 3 years, underwent 6 medicated cycles including 2 IUI's last year, all failed.

I am finally emerging from that in time for my appointment with a 2nd, highly recommended RE, who has successfully gotten two of my co-workers pregnant via IVF.\n \nHe reviewed my case and said after three IUI's, statistically it's probably not going to happen for me and recommended IVF.  In the meantime, we are throwing the whole \"shebang\" at this next IUI- injectables, Femara, the works. \nMy dilemma is that I am already expecting failure again even though I haven't started trying (again) and also am afraid of said failure because of how hard I took things a few months ago.  Part of me feels like for the emotional and physical toll these drugs take on me, I would really prefer only doing it once, and I am being quoted 70% success rates if we pursue IVF versus 18-22% with IUI. \n\nObviously the cost is a concern.  The IUI will set me back about $800-$900 and of course the IVF is much, much more $. At this point I'm tired of bleeding both my money and my sanity for bleak odds and disappointment and kinda would rather go with the more \"sure\" bet. On the other hand, my other voice speaks up and says it's worth trying at least one more time for the IUI and now I just don't know.\n \nThose of you who have traveled farther down this road than I, what are your thoughts and advice you can lend a lost soul like me?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8106, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "IVF/IUI crossroads", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/89qpys/ivfiui_crossroads/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "MaggieEh", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "30/RPL/MFI/IUIx3/FET#1 Fail"}], "author_flair_text": "30/RPL/MFI/IUIx3/FET#1 Fail", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1522858787, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/89qxg1/when_did_you_seek_a_second_opinion_should_i/", "gilded": 0, "id": "89qxg1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Advice"}], "link_flair_template_id": "1ae87cfc-92a6-11e4-8e5a-22000b26873e", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/89qxg1/when_did_you_seek_a_second_opinion_should_i/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1522886379, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 4, "selftext": "We've been seeing our current RE for 15 months.

You\u2019ve all been so helpful and supportive through this. \n\nI\u2019ve been diagnosed with PCOS for about 15 years, but haven\u2019t had the \u201cstring of pearls\u201d cysts for about 8 years now. Major symptoms are elevated free testosterone (was on Spiro until Dec 2017) and insulin resistance related weight fuckery, and am taking Metformin for this. Also on thyroid meds right now since I was a little low for desired pregnancy range. My AMH is also low enough to be likely DOR, having tested between 0.6 - 1.4 between October 2016 and December 2017. Lowest levels were first and last. \n\nI had an AFC of 13 - 17 (some discrepancy in my record) at cycle baseline. Started on Follistim 300, Menopur 150 on CD3 and stimmed for 12 days, adding Ganirelix at CD7, increasing Menopur to 225 on CD 10. Growth was very uneven with two lead follicles that were 20-22mm at trigger, two behind that were 17-18mm and four others between 11 - 15mm that didn\u2019t respond at all until around CD9 or 10. My husband had a successful TESE as he had a prior vasectomy. \n\nRetrieved 8 follicles, 7 eggs,\n3 mature. All three fertilized.

I didn't get it. But, he had a hard time. He is 29 now (30 in december). He got married 2 years ago and his lovely wife, unfortunately has Polycystic ovary syndrome too. So, all the while we were worried she had troubles with fertility, but a few days ago, he went for a thorough medical checkup and confessed that he has shrinkage in ONE testicles. Its fucked up. I wonder why he didn't open up, but that's too personal anyway. He must've been really fucked in the head, all this while :( \nI was worried and looking for answers of people who have gone through the same. He is directed for sperm count analysis as one of his testes has shrunk now. In a week, we will know if he can naturally father or not. Else, we hope artificial insemination works. If you've gone through anything, please write me back. My parents are so sad too. We're all troubled because most of us feel, we could've gotten him more help as times were really bad back then. My grandfather was also in surgery at the same time and my dad had to oscillate between both to ensure good medical care for both. My mom keeps saying dad should've had chucked his dad's operation, which is just the stressed-out-mom in her talking. She is a good mum, but she is freaked out and always in prayers nowadays. I'm worried too. I wanna see little cute babes of my lovely brother and lovelier sis-in-law. \nHe has shrinkage in one testicles, not both. He is ejaculating (I guess, otherwise they would've noticed the lack of sperm already). He had been vaccinated, still got it when he was in the 10th grade. He was a pubertal male, then, right? Is it any relief to think he is affected only in testes? Although online medical publications say infertility is extremely rare in such a case, they do stress on the low sperm count being next to infertility. Is the impaired infertility worrisome? What did you do? So, any help on the subject (other than what I found on Google; mind you I'm a content writer with high research skills, so skip the information you read on google and tell me everything you've personally gone through!).

We learned that I have several immune factors that are likely preventing implantation by attacking the embryo. I don't remember what they are because JESUS it was like listening to an hour-long biochem lecture. \n\nBecause of these immune factors, he recommended the following:\n\n1. one round of LIT (leukocyte immunization therapy), followed by retesting and a possible second round of LIT. This is not approved in the US so we would have to travel to Tucson and then go to the center that does it across the border in Mexico.\n\nIf my results are still bad after 2 rounds, I will do a month of Humira and IVIG treatment.\n\n2. Lovenox injections on day 6 of FET cycle.\n\n3. Prednisone starting before FET and continuing through first trimester if successful. Likely IVIG treatment at time of transfer as well. \n\nI'm so fucking overwhelmed by all this. The timing of all this means we won't be able to do an FET until August, and they strongly recommend not trying naturally in the meantime because it can lead to miscarriage as you go through the treatments. \n\nETA: I really wish I'd have done this before my second retrieval.

We started seeking help almost a year ago now and I diagnosed my husband with retrograde ejaculation (basically due to a surgery as an infant, semen goes into his bladder instead of coming out) so conceiving naturally is literally impossible due to the lack of sperm. I'm a molecular biologist, so I saw all the sperm in the urine under a microscope and we tried some at home inseminations with sperm that I had isolated from the urine and re-suspended in a saline solution (with no luck). The RE we were seeing wanted his lab to confirm this diagnosis, but they screwed it up and told us that there was basically no sperm in there. Then 5 months go by of my husband visiting a male infertility specialist, $1000s in genetic testing, me being super depressed about not only my scientific ability but our inability to have my husbands biological children, and finally one more semen analysis that basically confirms my original diagnosis and that that they totally screwed up the first one. The problem is that now I kind of don't like my RE (because obviously, his lab sucks, but also that he ignored the fact that his lab results did not match what I had already told him). What I really want is for a lab to wash the sperm in the urine and do an insemination (which has been published to be successful in numerous papers), but my RE is being super negative about it not working and wants us to do go forward with IVF and a testicular extraction with donor sperm on hand. I'm want to be realistic but kind of just don't really trust my RE anymore -- I feel like since I'm young and it's male factor, he might just be using our case to boost his center's success rates. I really want to find someone who is willing to try some less invasive options first, especially since I'm still young. I feel like all I need is a really good lab to do the sperm wash and insemination, but I don't know how to sort through and vet the different providers and clinics without making appointments with 5 different clinics. Also, the SART data seems to be out of date (2014/2015) -- does anyone know if there are clinic stats online that are more up to date?

We allowed ourselves to dream and hope that this would be a last in 38 weeks. \n\nWe came home and while my husband was in the restroom, I saw an email from close friends who told us they were pregnant. They did it in the way we all suggest to others who ask for our advice. \n\n\"We wanted to let you guys know that I'm pregnant and due in October. While we're excited, we know you've been wanting the same thing for yourselves for quite a while and it's completely understandable if our news causes sadness for you. We'd love to grab dinner or a hike in the next couple of weeks but also understand if you need a little space. \n\nWe're still rooting for you.\" \n\nI went from hopeful and optimistic about this cycle and our situation to a total mess. They're a few years younger than us. She had her IUD removed right around the time my first transfer failed in December - which means her first month ever trying simply worked. I crumbled and completely took it out on my husband, who is hurting just as badly as I am, and is my rock and deserved so much more in that moment. I woke him up at five in the morning, unable to sleep, to apologize, so maybe we could start today back to where we were last night - at the very least knowing how much we have each other through it all. \n\nI'm happy for our friends; it's how it should be for all of us. But as it turns out, life doesn't work that way, and I'm still feeling vulnerable and sad and I wish I could just flashback to earlier last night and hold on to that feeling of hope and optimism. \n\nFingers crossed today's FET is our turning point. \n\nETA: I think the reason I was so upset last night is that our friends were so sensitive and thoughtful. I couldn't say \"another asshole friend who doesn't get how hard this has been!\" and mask my sadness with bitterness or anger. In their joy they were still compassionate about our situation; and they're the first ones who have even tried - but guess what? It still sucks.

The fewer issues you have now, the less bad they'll get once you're shooting hormones into your body.\n\n* get your xrays updated before you do a transfer! (I haven't done this, and was due for an xray today. If the transfer failed, I go back in next week for new xrays)\n\n* get a water pick, and/or swish warm salt water around in your mouth if your gums are tender. \n\n* If you've got any cavities or other pending problems that your dentist is keeping an eye on, ask if they'd be willing to do them when you are pregnant, or if you should just do them sooner, because when treatment works, you might end up having to get a cavity filled without anesthetic (because apparently some dentists are sadists)\n\n* If you get diagnosed with hormone-related \"pregnancy gingivitis* during an FET cycle, don't feel bad about yourself, it's not actually preventable, just survivable.\n\nAny other tips from our vast collective experiences?

I love Gabe from the office. \n\nTLC show 3 wives one husband-mention of multiple miscarriages. \n\nMary Kills People-Really enjoy this, the plot line is interesting, and no triggers. \n\nUnReal-good drama and no triggers this season. \n\nSuits-I really don't get the plot of this show anymore, but no triggers. I don't understand how Donna gets super promoted, and Harvey is dating his ex-therapist, also how will Meghan Markle leave?! So I keep watching to find out. \n\nGrey's Anatomy-I'm super bummed that April and Arizona are leaving the show. Excited to see if Meredith will start dating a potential love interest that was mentioned in the previous episode last week.\n\nOkay this is dumb but it's so trigger free and innocent, I really love We Bare Bears, it's a cartoon about 3 brother bears, a panda, polar, and grizzly. It's on cartoon network but I download it online.\n\nRe-watched the internship, I really find this movie funny. Also re-watched Central Intelligence and Kevin Hart and the Rock are such a good team together. Jumaji was recommended to me by another user and I highly recommend it, very funny, no triggers.

I have been struggling for months, grasping at a way to overcome my weight gain.Every time I grab hold, back in control of what goes in my mouth, I fall back into my old ways. I make excuse after excuse. Oh I won't go over five more lbs, than five more lbs is gained. I keep telling myself to get ahold of it before it goes any further, but I fail. Truly not seeing what everyone is seeing. My clothes are getting tighter some not fitting at all. I'd decided to go on a diet, try to lose what I have gained. I'd be good for about two weeks or so. But have a binge night and fall right back into my binging habits. My weight gain all started back in 2012, when I found out I couldn't have children. Drs told me it would be next to impossible, test after test. She finally diagnosed me. I'll never forget that day in April 2012. Judy Dant called me to tell me she needed to see me in person rather than give me my results on the phone. I can still see the lump in her throat as she delivered the blow to me. She said \u201cKaty, I got your labs back and it's not good. Your prolactin levels came back high, which usually indicates that the patient has a tumor. I'll send you to a specialist and will hopefully rule out a brain Tumor, which will make having children a very hard thing to do. I'll see to it Katy, we will get you pregnant, also I believe you have PCOS your ultrasound sound show tons of cysts on both ovaries. I sat there frozen. I hadn't thought of that possibility, yes my periods were always off,but I thought once I wanted to have children it would be as easy as pie. It was for everyone I knew. I never had a second doubt, that it would be the same for me until that day, which was probably a lie because I knew something wasn't right. That changed everything about me, who I was, who I was going to be, the dreams I had hope for now further than reach. After I left that appointment feeling numb, I did extensive research on what this tumor entails. I already knew I had it. I had all the symptoms it all made sense. The symptoms were headaches, irregular periods, milk supply, and infertility. Things that I secretly struggled with all made since, and that was a relief, but tackling the Infertility would be a challenge. I knew I wanted to be a mom, but now my hopes weren't so high .Month after month, year after year, negative after negative ,no baby in sight. Not one pregnancies. It takes a tole, leaves you feeling broken. \u00a0No one understands, not even the closest ones to you. No one, but myself. The many night I lay there thinking about what could be. Would he have my eyes , Ryan nose, would he look like Anna? What he would call him? Would he like sports? I can almost hear his laughter. I picture his beautiful face. I call Thomas, Ryan calls him Fry. We both dream. I got lucky though. I have Anna. She's my world, she literally doesn't know what she has done for me. What she has given me, that day she called me mom. I owe them. A healthy me. Could this be my answer? I have to find out and see. As the tears roll down my face, I grasp on the hope that I can do this. I can overcome. This battle I will always fight. I just I hope I win. No. I will win. This is my time. Time to shine. No looking back. I got this. My goal is to lose is lose 136 lbs, as long as it takes. Day by day, week by week, month by month year by year, all I got is time. Time to make the right choices. I am in control. \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8118, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weight gain caused by infertility", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8a6w4t/weight_gain_caused_by_infertility/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "swcic123", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1522994239, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8a763b/pcod_polycystic_ovaries_treatment_at_swcic_in/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8a763b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/8a763b/pcod_polycystic_ovaries_treatment_at_swcic_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1522998095, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 0, "selftext": "Giving equal importance for your food habit is an important part of fertility treatment and especially in cases of PCOD.

This is the first time our RE started seriously talking about a surrogate or adoption, and said she would be comfortable with us doing 1 or 2 more transfers before seriously considering other options.  They can't find anything else to treat for my wife - we are doing IVIG (also seeing an autoimmune expert), prednisone, all the fertility meds, etc.  They don't know what else to do.\n\nI guess because I've had a couple of years to deal with my infertility issues it isn't hitting me as hard as my wife - we are always upset when a transfer doesn't work, but this one has been especially rough on her.  I guess I'm looking for some advice on how to best support her.  I've been as open as possible with her with how I'm feeling and keeping an open dialogue, but also trying to distract her when she gets too sad with other things in our lives.  I planned a trip out of the city this weekend to get away as she said she needed to do something.\n\nIs there anything else I can do to help her get through this as a husband?  Also, if anyone has experience with surrogates or adoption I'd be happy to take any advice on first steps (although, the surrogate agency that our RE recommends is super expensive and may not be realistic - we could probably afford it but would have nothing left in savings).\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8118, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Nearing the End of the Road", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8aaad3/nearing_the_end_of_the_road/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1523039757, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8abyeg/friday_afternoon_discussion_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8abyeg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 74, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/8abyeg/friday_afternoon_discussion_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1523042876, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 4, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

Problem is that I will not be ovulating during the next two term breaks when my husband is able to participate in IVF (my cycles are pretty clockwork, we're unexplained) . So my question is - how much can/will they alter your cycle using drugs? Could they possibly change the date of my ovulation by a week or two? A day or two? I'm sorry if this info is out there in the ether somewhere, but my searches are yielding general cycle information and info on the fact that altering baseline is done- but not by how much. \n\nI should also possibly explain that for us, IVF will involve travel (probably to eastern Europe), and this is part of why it's so important to have the procedures in between term times. \n\nAny info greatly appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8123, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How much is it possible to alter baseline?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8ad0vk/how_much_is_it_possible_to_alter_baseline/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1523052429, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8adjir/pros_and_cons/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8adjir", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 34, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/8adjir/pros_and_cons/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1523055167, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 6, "selftext": "What was good this week?

On the other hand, a positive test would help a ton with her stress (and my stress to boot). She already has anxiety and I\u2019m really scared a negative test would really put her down in the dumps obviously. But then again the stress of her being worried is doing the same. \n\nSo to my question. As her husband, does anyone have any advice for me to give her? I have calmed her down a lot already, but what does everyone think about her doing the test in the morning? I\u2019m so torn on it I don\u2019t know if I should agree that she should do it or not. She realizes that even a negative test on that thing in the morning still does not mean ivf didn\u2019t work, but I know it will still devastate her. A quick little background, our infertility comes from my end and everything they have tested on her shows completely normal. The frozen embryo they put in was genetically tested and came back AA I believe it\u2019s called. She has went through so much for me to be able to try and have a biological child that I feel like a giant turd that there is nothing I can do to help ease her worry anymore then I can. So is the urine test a good idea or terrible idea in your opinions? \n\nThank you very much for any input!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8125, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need opinions on testing after ivf but before the blood test", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8af7ik/i_need_opinions_on_testing_after_ivf_but_before/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "Celt42", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "35, trying since 7/2008, zero pregnancies.

Multiple crossroads. Have you ever seen a spaghetti-junction? (google image search that absurdness). That is us, right now. \nYesterday we got the disappointing news of our negative beta for our 5th try at IUI with donor sperm. In the same communication, we also received the news that our RE is now going into research, and we were assigned to a new resident trainee at the clinic. We also got the go ahead that the next step should be IVF w/ ICSI.\n\nOur 5 tries at IUI history is as such: 4 failed IUIs, 1 success ending in trisomy 20. Cycles have been medicated from everything from clomid, to letrozole, HCG trigger, to Ovidrel. My average was typically 2 follicles per medicated IUI, but with clomid I over-responded. I have a low AMH for my age (about the average for someone 10 years older than myself), but a seemingly very high AFC. These results have been labeled \"incongruent\" and a suggested diagnosis of DOR has been addressed. With the cost of donor sperm being as it is, we are at this point ready to call it quits with the IUIs. I am mentally ready to do my funded attempt at IVF. \n\nRealistically, this will probably be our last ditch effort. I don't think I could fathom the cost of an additional unfunded cycle. I have a lot of anxiety re: spending money, and even unloading the money we have into 5 failed attempts has been hard for me to deal with. \n\nCross-roads questions:\n\n1)I am really uncomfortable with being assigned to a trainee RE for my one shot at IVF. I think I would like to look into transferring to a satellite of the clinic which is closer to my new work. In doing this, I would also get to switch out of this new trainee's caseload and onto a much more experienced RE. The only downside to this is potentially having a longer wait time for my funded cycle. Opinions?\n\n2) We had some shitty luck with donors during the IUI process. Our first donor was someone we really both loved. We bought 3 vials from him to start. It quickly became apparent after two cycles that his numbers just sucked. 5 million, and 2.5 million were post-double-wash counts (our clinic has a mandatory wash policy on even pre-washed vials). We decided to forgo using the 3rd vial and instead did the subsequent 3 IUIs with 2 new donors who both had great counts. In your opinion, with IVF w/ ICSI, would you go back to using that 3rd vial from donor #1? I unfortunately don't remember his motility/morphology but presumably after 2 washes those low numbers were likely whatever was still good. Or would you instead choose to toss that remaining vial and spend another $1k on a new vial from one of these new donors? \n\nWhat do I dooooo....", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8123, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "At multiple crossroads: IUI to IVF, new doctor, sperm donor.
