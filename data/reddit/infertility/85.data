After several tests it was determined that my husband has low sperm count and other issues with sperm quality. I checked out fine after several tests and the fact I got pregnant successfully in my early 20s they have been primarily focused on treating my husband.  Due to other life events (work relocations - 2 sick parents) we decided to let 2 years run it course and see what happens (I have used ovulation kits etc) ........ here I am 2+ years later with no luck. \n\nWe are going to go back to Toronto West Fertility but my husband says he has a 'bad feeling' about them (I know, I know... it's probably just his anxiety) and wanted to get a second opinion. When we started digging deeper into exploring other clinics (New Life is on our list - as well as TRIO both in the Toronto area) my husband suggested the possibility about going to the US. On a recent business trip to the US he met a colleague who mentioned that he had gone to the US for fertility treatments after having some lukewarm experiences in the Toronto area as well (no idea the specific details). So far, the clinic we dealt with plan of action was to put my husband on meds for 3 months and then based on that move on to IUI/IVF (IVF being more then likely). \n\nI have reached out to a few clinics that I found online that would work for us logistically (as there is a possibility I may go with my husband to the US for 5 months in the New Year and the fact my job as a flight attendant allows me access to airfare). From my preliminary research and from the information my husband has gathered there are screening tests for birth defects/abnormalities, 'bring home a baby guarantees', gender selection (pls don\u2019t judge me), transparent data regarding the clinic's success rates that are not available in Canada. I realize that these clinics essentially operate as a business and therefore I want to make sure I'm not falling for a sales technique. \n\nI have a few phone consultations set up this week and I'm completely in the dark about this.

I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed and could really use some advice.\n\nI just turned 36 and my husband is 34 (both straight, Cis folks). I've always wanted kids and I work with young children. It took my husband a minute to feel ready, but he was 100% onboard when I finally got my IUD removed in February. We were delighted to get pregnant right away and then devastated to lose that pregnancy at nine weeks. I went in for another ultrasound and found out that the heartbeat was much slower than it should be and was told to wait for the inevitable. My miscarriage happened on actual Mother's Day, which was almost funny but nothing about that shit was funny. Misery and heartbreak - you guys get it.  I know a lot of you have been trying a lot longer and have dealt with more - my love to you. \n\nBecause we got pregnant so quickly, I coped thru focusing on getting pregnant again. Maybe it would just happen right away again and everything would be fine this time and I could escape this bog of eternal sadness? Eh, eh? Oof. I've been charting (tho I'm not the best at taking my temperature at a consistent time every morning) and using ovulation strips. \n\nIt took months for my cycles to regulate after the loss - my luteal phase was short. It seemed like I was having implantation symptoms and my temp was staying up and then I'd get my period like 6 days early. One time it was 8 days early. There are so many reasons to get your period late but not many reasons to get your period early. I started to wonder if conception was happening followed by recurrent early loss - this is a thing that I've read about to books by accredited people but apparently it's a controversial idea. \n\nI was taking Best Nest's Ready, Set, Go fertility prenatal and then switched to Conception by Eu Natural. Conception contains Vitex and you take it through the first trimester. It seemed like I was having a hormone problem (too little progesterone?) and I wanted something that was a little more of a corrective than a booster. I've been taking the Conception supplement for about three months and I've finally had two 28 day cycles so I feel like it's helping regulate in some way. I started my husband on Conception for dudes about a month ago. I also added Baby Dance fertility lubricant to the mix during my last cycle. I've also been doing somewhat weekly acupuncture at our local community acupuncture place.\n\nI've felt really torn between going full tilt into the realm of medical infertility treatment vs. trying to chill and use OTC resources. As far as OTC resources, I've been looking at OvuSense (fertility monitor), Modern Fertility (at home fertility/hormone testing), Mosie (at-home alternative to IUI), getting panels run at Any Lab Test Now, etc. Money is tight and I have high-deductible insurance. Additionally, I haven't always had the best experience with doctors and I'm so worried about the money and the stress and the unknowns of this kind of \"treatment.\" But I've decided that I want any help I can get and I'm going back to my OBGYN on Monday for an ovulation ultrasound. I'm also worried that I have an underlying condition that's effecting things that I don't know about. \n\nI went back to my Dr. when I was having the short luteal phase issue (I'd been on Conception for about a month at that time) and she tested my progesterone and said it was normal and indicated ovulation. I miraculously really like my Dr. but she's not a very outside of the box kinda lady. She said the next step was to do the ovulation ultrasound and probably start taking Clomid or a similar drug to boost ovulation. I have a gut feeling that I need progesterone support (though hoping my supplement is helping my hormone production) and she said that she's be willing to prescribe it even though my level appeared normal, but warned that it was really expensive.  She said that if I'm worried about my hormones, she'd like to refer me to a reproductive endocrinologist (sounds good but so expensive).  She also said we could do a dye test to make sure my tubes were open and mentioned testing my husband. \n\nI kind of thought that the fact that I'd gotten pregnant recently was a good indication that I was ovulating and my tubes were open, etc. and felt a little disappointed with this advice/plan (with the exception of testing my husband - I always think that this should be done early so the lady isn't the only one under the microscope). I also thought she might want to test my thyroid, etc. and look for any underlying conditions. I think she's willing to honor any requests I have for testing, etc. but I'm not counting on her to volunteer the ideas. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed and don't want to seem like a crazy person. \n\nSo I'm for humbly and gratefully asking for your advice and encouragment. What tests should I ask for/pursue? What do you think the best next steps are? Have you had any good experiences with OTC things that I should ask my Dr. about? \n\nAs far as other info about me, I'm overweight (I have a heavy bone structure and have always been heavier) but I go to the gym and eat pretty healthily. I'm trying to double down on getting healthier but never appreciate body shaming (that's some of my baggage with Dr.'s).  I've had a lot of family stress that's messed with my system in the last few years. My Mom had several miscarriages (and 3 healthy, fullterm babies) and both my mother and sister have thyroid issues. My sister's thyroid issues began after the birth of her son. All of the women in my family deal with autoimmune issues but it's hard to nail down exactly what it is. I don't believe I have PCOS and when I was pregnant, the doctors didn't notice anything unusual about my anatomy during the 3 transvaginal ultrasounds of my reproductive system. \n\nI really can't thank you enough for reading this. It really helps me feel a lot less alone to get this all out. Thank you. &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15087, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "36 and dealing with infertility after pregnancy loss - requesting advice before Dr. appt", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dtlgyp/36_and_dealing_with_infertility_after_pregnancy/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "rkasr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_48mnb1m6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573265976, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dtpvxl/cdc_vs_sart/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dtpvxl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "8ba82e74-18df-11e9-8426-0efccfe053d4", "link_flair_text": "Research &amp; Science", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/dtpvxl/cdc_vs_sart/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1573265978, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm pretty confused about CDC vs SART statistics.

In fact, I've never used reddit before. I stumbled upon this thread in the same way I'm sure many of you did -- googling around. Reading the community rules, I sighed a huge sigh of relief. So, thanks to the moderators, whoever you are. Most other infertility message boards made me feel even worse...\n\nMy wife and I live in Southeast Asia. My wife's brother kindly offered to be our sperm donor. We tried at-home insemination on and off for a year. It was tricky though because he lives in a different city than us and we all work full-time. Scheduling visits right at the time of my ovulation was difficult and stressful. Needless to say, that didn't work. But I figured that was just because of logistics, not because of any underlying fertility issue.\n\nThis September we finally decided to do IVF. I'm not getting any younger (I'm 38 now) and my wife and I are going to move to the US soon. So, time is short. \n\nI don't know if this is common, but I went into my first round of IVF very excited and confident. I happily gave up coffee and beer (both of which I love). I felt like I would be pregnant soon. \n\nShort protocol. 14 eggs on egg retrieval day - good! 10 fertilized - good good! genetic testing...all abnormal. Devastating. I felt an intensity of heart break that I was not prepared for. \n\nI felt exhausted through October. I struggled with work. I teach at a university and I also teach piano on weekends. Suddenly working with all these lovely young people made me want to cry. I managed to stay professional, but it was tough at times. Now, I pulling myself back together and my wife and I are getting ready to try again. \n\nFor financial reasons, and because we are leaving for North America soon, this may be our last shot -- at least our last shot with my eggs. My wife and I may consider embryo donation in the US if this doesn't work. She does not want to get pregnant herself. I'm trying to go into this round of IVF with more realistic expectations. It may work. It may not. Now I know better.\n\nIf I may end with one question: how many months is it recommended to wait between egg retrievals? If I did it in September, is it reasonable to try again in November? We're moving to the US in February. I will travel back for frozen embryo transfer if necessary.\n\nMy body feels good right now. I've been eating healthy (or at least healthier than normal), exercising, and staying off coffee and alcohol. Been taking loads of vitamins: CoQ10, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, omega 3 -- not sure if all this does any good. But what the hell? I'll try anything/everything. A friend suggested I go give an offering at this Buddhist temple known to help with fertility and I  (devout Jew) considered it! \n\nAnyway, that's my intro. Thanks for reading. I hope I didn't misuse the \"standalone post\" feature. And thanks too all of you for sharing your info and stories.

Only pregnancy related test results are limited to this thread.\n\nYou can post the outcome of your pregnancy related tests here, positive or negative. However, **if a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&amp;C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, discussion can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** \n\nPlease keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need. This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Discussions of positive beta and/or HPT results, beta hell, beta limbo, or very early pregnancy concerns are to take place in this thread.   Do not post images of HPT tests. An appropriate place to share photos of HPT tests is /r/TFABlineporn.\n\n* Infertility includes:  primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.\n\nFor a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).\n\n**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top \"Read This\" sticky on the main page.** \n\nOnce fetal heartbeat has been confirmed or you have graduated from RE, we encourage you to look for support and continue sharing your story at our sister community, /r/infertilitybabies. You may also be interested in posting at /r/whatworkedforme.  You are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences and continue to support other community members here on r/infertility.\n \n In order to keep this thread from getting overwhelming:\n\n- Edit your original post with any updates instead of posting again.

I started on TFAB years ago and took a long break from looking at any of the TTC sub Reddits.  \n\nMy husband and I have been TTC for 2.5 years.  I just turned 36.  We are still diagnosed unexplained.  Did 3 IUIs in the summer and this past month did our first retrieval.  They took out 17 eggs, 10 fertilized, then only 3 made it to blastocyst.  2 looked \u201cgood\u201d and 1 looked \u201cfair/poor\u201d.  Friday night they called with the results of the PGS testing and the only one with the right number of chromosomes was the fair/poor one.  So now we have one. \n\nI haven\u2019t been able to talk to my doctor yet, but I\u2019m confused about why our results were so much worse than everyone was telling us they would be.  My doctor thought we\u2019d get at least 3-4 embryos.  Maybe just bad luck? \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m trying to process all of this.  I\u2019m guessing they will still recommend trying a transfer?  I\u2019m not sure the chance it will work, but I feel like the last thing I was told was around 40%.  If that doesn\u2019t work then we\u2019re back to square one and down over $20,000.  I\u2019m sure there are many, many of you here who relate.  \n\nI\u2019m posting here because I\u2019m not great at keeping up with the dailies, but I would love if anyone is in a similar place and wants someone to talk to, to start a regular chat.  Being there to support others and having others who understand and support me is the only thing that has gotten me through these past two years.  &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15113, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction- processing results of first retrieval", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dudxbi/introduction_processing_results_of_first_retrieval/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573406440, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/due8od/sunday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "due8od", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 65, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/due8od/sunday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1573406445, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!\n\nUse this thread to share things that are NOT specific to treatment.

I have a confirmed case of Micropenis; confirmed at birth as they were unsure about what gender I was and although has had some treatment, still is significantly below average. \n         - Penetrative sex is possible in the right positions\n         - Fairly active sex life with partner; around 4-5 times a week at the start of our 3 year relationships, now around 1-2 times a week...\n         - Both have a clean sexual health history; no STI\u2019s in the past.\n         - Contraception has never been and isn\u2019t used.\n\n2. I have a condition called \u201cHypogonadatrophic Hypogonadism\u201d\n         - Hypogonadism is a condition in which the male testes (or the female ovaries in other cases) produce little or no sex hormones.\n         - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is a form of hypogonadism that is due to a problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.\n\nSo, I knew from a young age stuff downstairs wasn\u2019t the same as everyone else\u2019s. I regularly attended appointments at UCLH in London, had hormone tests regularly, hormone therapy for around 3 years (which managed to repair my testosterone levels (mostly, still pretty saggy) and helped me develop some bod hair and muscle mass. \n\nSo when I met my now girlfriend of 3 years, and I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, after my first date I opened up with her and explained everything I knew about my conditions.\n\nSo, this brings me up until around a year ago where after conversations with my girlfriend we talk about getting my semen analysed to see if there is any problems as we had planned to start having children seeing as we had been to university, had good stable jobs and things were good.\n\nMy first results were;\n- Volume: 1.4mls\n- Complete Progressive Motility: 21%\n- Non-progressive Motility: 7%\n- Immotility: 72%\n- Sperm Concentration (million/per ml): 0.24 (24,000)\n- Total Sperm Number (million/per ejaculate): 0.34 (34,000)\n- Insufficient sperms to accurately assess morphology \n\nWhich, I am pretty sure are not great...\nI had them repeated 6 months later, and the results were a little worse with an 86% Immotility.\n\nI really started to ask this question last night, after my girlfriends sister gave birth to her first child. Seeing how happy she was holding him made me happy yet devastated at the same time. \n\nBut what made me ask this question more, was the fact that for the first time, she came out to me and said that she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019ll do if she can\u2019t have a baby.\n\nIt honestly went straight through me, ever since those results I had always wondered what the future held for us in terms or having a child.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t my decision to make about what\u2019s best for her, what would you do in my situation? \n\nM.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15117, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should my girlfriend and I break up, so she can have a child and the life she wants?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dui77s/should_my_girlfriend_and_i_break_up_so_she_can/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EmpoweredHealth", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_24ysy9mu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573439344, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dulpvf/infertility_struggles_and_ivf_with_boston_ivfs_dr/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dulpvf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/dulpvf/infertility_struggles_and_ivf_with_boston_ivfs_dr/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "husWuQ0oCUV3Wn4c-236tkpx1s8OdRD1OG3Bzu2ckSk", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/41HIDIjf71yOCBBI6mlnzZ395xJRr0DpuBqMLbtkjjA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f680bf061b424b8db11b90da9bd3fb97673bafb7", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/41HIDIjf71yOCBBI6mlnzZ395xJRr0DpuBqMLbtkjjA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4305b97be0bbb3d60dfa2a3a90e89816de3fdc9", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/41HIDIjf71yOCBBI6mlnzZ395xJRr0DpuBqMLbtkjjA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc707e23c100acb8d59b9a22e45f3449f8997492", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/41HIDIjf71yOCBBI6mlnzZ395xJRr0DpuBqMLbtkjjA.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=606fb5a4cc2b0a98751c7cdbb1fd361101313240", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/41HIDIjf71yOCBBI6mlnzZ395xJRr0DpuBqMLbtkjjA.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89d6074ef6a72511612dbf7f9e5fa420417d7bfd", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/41HIDIjf71yOCBBI6mlnzZ395xJRr0DpuBqMLbtkjjA.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3520347d1d5ba7112e95fa156ee819c51c9ad7f4", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/41HIDIjf71yOCBBI6mlnzZ395xJRr0DpuBqMLbtkjjA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=56a077b03f5d6ebddbc131491e4fc83da5c0afed", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1573439346, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you\u2019re an American woman in your 30s you likely know someone who is going through fertility treatment. What was once a stigmatized issue, leaving women feeling hopeless and alone, has become treatable. While female partners still bare the brunt of the pressure when baby-making stalls out, the treatment options have improved significantly in the last 30 years and more couples are successfully able to get pregnant than in the past. \n\nOne in eight American couples experience infertility, according to the CDC. After a woman turns 35, her fertility significantly decreases. The popular narrative around infertility often places the blame solely on the woman. However, as we discuss on this episode of [Empowered Health with Emily Kumler](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-33-infertility-struggles-and-ivf-with-dr-alan-penzias/id1452440833?i=1000455877645), research suggests **men play a role in approximately 40 to 50 percent of infertility cases.**\n\nThere is also outdated research that suggested older women would be much more likely to have miscarriages, but our host unpacks that much of that research was heavily influenced by the use of **amniocentesis** on all women 35 years or older. That practice is no longer in place because it caused miscarriages in about one percent of all women told to be tested, that\u2019s an incredibly high figure when you consider that ALL women 35+ were told to have an amnio. And those practices skewed the stats on older women and miscarriage rates because it was perhaps the amino that was to blame for the miscarriage not the mother\u2019s age. \n\nWhile the numbers around pregnancy are much more encouraging than once thought, we know that far too often women aren\u2019t properly screened before engaging in in vitro fertilization. Doctors are eager to get a woman pregnant and that can lead to negligence in diagnosing the underlying condition that is preventing her from conceiving and carrying her baby to term. Instead we see a trend of all women being treated identically, which raises our concern. \n\nOne of our guests, Dr. Alan Penzias, a reproductive endocrinologist and the surgical director of Boston IVF, is also an associate professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology at Harvard Medical School\u2013 and the director of the Fellowship Program in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, helps answer these concerns and gives listeners some important takeaway information that could protect them if they\u2019re thinking of going through fertility treatment. \n\nNatasha, a Boston-based special education teacher, shares her IVF journey with us. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most emotionally charged thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d Natasha tells Emily. \u201cIt\u2019s also the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life.\u201d\n\nThought some of you in this group might be interested in this, here's links to listen:\n\n[APPLE PODCASTS](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-33-infertility-struggles-and-ivf-with-dr-alan-penzias/id1452440833?i=1000455877645) | [SPOTIFY](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7hxj5YlnDtzsnRPkY7VGHL) | [GOOGLE PLAY](https://play.google.com/music/m/Dlorykzs52l26h76q43gd567rlu?t=Ep_33_Infertility_struggles_and_IVF_with_Dr_Alan_Penzias-Empowered_Health) | [STITCHER](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/empowered-health/e/65039709?autoplay=true) | [LUMINARY](https://luminarypodcasts.com/listen/emily-kumler-469/empowered-health/ep-33-infertility-struggles-and-ivf-with-dr-alan-penzias/9ac34196-c5d5-4d2b-9eb6-8b66d3c9cc75) | [OVERCAST](https://overcast.fm/+QuxkHws70) | [WEBSITE](https://empoweredhealthshow.com/infertility-ivf-alan-penzias/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15118, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Infertility struggles and IVF with Boston IVF's Dr. Alan Penzias", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dulpvf/infertility_struggles_and_ivf_with_boston_ivfs_dr/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MissBoomey", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4q144gjr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573449666, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dunrbe/window_shopping_for_a_baby_i_dont_have/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dunrbe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/dunrbe/window_shopping_for_a_baby_i_dont_have/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1573449666, "score": 1, "selftext": "Does anyone else get online and start looking at baby section ?

It's a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help.\n\nThe daily Chat threads are for anything and everything not related to treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won't stop asking about when you're having kids? Funny story? Rant? These all go in the Chat thread. This is a great place to get to know fellow members outside of their treatment or diagnosis.   \n\nHave a question that you think might warrant a standalone post or doesn't fit in the treatment/chat threads?  Try the FAQ/Wiki first!  https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index  We have archived posts covering getting started, what all those acronyms mean, what we wish we knew ahead of time, individual experiences with ALL the medications, treatment options, common protocols, procedures, paying for treatment, past AMA archives, hunger games data... there's a lot of information there!\n\nStand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. Questions phrased like \"has anyone else tried clomid?!\" are not generally well received. There are over 10,000 subscribers here with the majority having gone through several different courses of treatment.  Use specific titles for your posts to make them more easily searched by users. \"IVF?\" is not super helpful. \"MFI and Endo, First round of IVF - Should we do ICSI?\" is more likely to get useful responses and easier for future members to find in search.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15123, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "new", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Standalone Posts &amp; FAQ Reminder", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/duqyz5/standalone_posts_faq_reminder/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "omfgSarah", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "27F | DOR | IVF soon", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_95jdb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573486521, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dutzpe/introduction_dor_ivf_soon/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dutzpe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/dutzpe/introduction_dor_ivf_soon/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1573486525, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nI've been lurking here for a while and soaking up info from the FAQ so I figured it's finally time for me to introduce myself. I'm moderately active on TFAB and stilltrying; you're welcome to stalk my post history for more details on my jOuRnEy so far. \n\nMy fiance and I started TTC last January. I had chlamydia in my early twenties so I was worried I got PID and had blocked tubes so I sought out testing at 6 months. A HyCoSy showed my tubes look great, but CD3 tests show I have DOR. Mr omfg's sperm looked great. My RE wanted us to start IVF immediately but my insurance won't pay for it til we've been trying for a year. \n\nSo I'll start IVF round 1 in January. I'm on an antagonist protocol [I think that's what it's called?]; priming with estrogen patches and Cetrotide. Then stimming with 300 Menopur AM and 300 Gonal F PM. Then more Cetrotide til trigger [they didn't specify which trigger yet]. And then [hopefully] a fresh transfer. \n\nI am, as I'm sure most people are/were, worried about the injections. Mr omfg is going to give them to me as he has experience giving shots to one of his exes. \n\nI'm also just worried we won't get any/enough eggs/embryos. My insurance doesn't allow banking so I have to use whatever I get before I can start another ER cycle. \n\nI don't really have any questions, but if anyone has suggestions or advice for me I'd love to hear it. I'm not very good at staying active in dailies since I've been out of the game for a bit, but I'm sure I'll find the treatment dailies here super helpful when the time comes.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15123, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction; DOR.

I\u2019ve been on continuous birth control since I was 19, a version of Seasonique where I only get my period every 12 weeks or 4x a year. The reason I went on this method is because I was very very irregular growing up. I got my first period at 13/14 and it was never monthly. I would go 3-4 months without a period and then suddenly have one. In HS it was a bit more regular, sometimes every other month. But one year I don\u2019t think I got it for 6 months. At the time I asked my PCP if she thought this was concerning but she just said irregularity was common when first getting a period and it would become more regular as I got older. When I got to college I still wasn\u2019t getting it regularly and it was very hard to guess when I would get it. I\u2019d go 3 months without it or any PMS symptoms and then suddenly I\u2019d have it for 3-4 days, then nothing for a few weeks and then I\u2019d get it again. It became so hard to track that I went on birth control just to get regular and at first I did a month to month version. However since I was just not used to having a period every month it was really stressful and kept giving me yeast infections. After talking to my doctor they recommended the seasonique version I\u2019ve been on for the last 4 years. \n\nAll of this background is to say that I recently asked my doctor if he thought I would have trouble conceiving because of my history with irregularity. He said I most likely would but that I was still young and I shouldn\u2019t immediately assume the worst. I\u2019m on this sub asking if anyone else had history of irregularity and also had issues conceiving. I\u2019m also wondering if there is any method to test my fertility at this time. My main concern is that we don\u2019t want to try having kids until we are around 29-32 due to career and financial constraints. I\u2019m just worried that waiting till I\u2019m at that age will only add to problems with getting pregnant. Personally, I think I\u2019ve always known it\u2019d be hard to get pregnant so I\u2019ve subconsciously come to terms with it and think that I will be okay if it doesn\u2019t happen for me. But my fianc\u00e9 has expressed he definitely wants to be a dad some day, I\u2019ve told him about my concerns but he just says that we will deal with it when the time comes and he still wants to marry me even if kids aren\u2019t in the cards for us. I worry he isn\u2019t taking it seriously so I kinda want to get a better picture of my fertility status before we get married. If there\u2019s really zero chance of me getting pregnant I want him to have the whole picture before committing to us, I don\u2019t want him to regret this choice in a few years. \n\nAny anecdotes or advice is appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15135, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does irregularity equal infertility?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dvbyvo/does_irregularity_equal_infertility/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573579238, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dvd1to/tuesday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dvd1to", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 179, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/dvd1to/tuesday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1573579241, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!\n\nUse this thread to share things that are NOT specific to treatment.

I think because for so long I was just waiting to get pregnant (again). Anyway - 4 years ago I got pregnant, lost that baby at 14 weeks (and had a perforated uterus during my first D&amp;C) Got pregnant again 3 years ago and lost that baby girl at 16 weeks. No pregnancy since. In that time I saw multiple MFMs to address the repeat loss (but so far nothing has been found) and we continued to try to get pregnant. Then my Father in law got sick and passed away which increased stress and decreased the focus on baby. But we've been trying going on 24 months. Finally last spring I started pursuing testing - and after so much reluctance from my OB - we had my husband's sperm tested - he lost 80 lbs since the last pregnancy so people said there was no way it was him. It is. He has a varicocele and low total motile sperm counts. Urologist said we should just do IUI for a few rounds and jump to IVF but RE I saw recently thinks husband should fix varicocele while we also try IUI. So here we are. My blood tests are pretty good - I had a few polyps removed from uterus in June but AMH, FSH, etc are good. I did see an RE who focuses on repeat loss and she found nothing - just told me to lose 10 lbs to try and lower my blood pressure.  \n\n\nBut I'm suddenly feeling not so motivated to keep on trying? Maybe its because we got the prices for IUI and IVF and the sticker shock blew me away. Probably I'm mostly really scared that ART won't work OR it will but I won't stay pregnant (current RE is willing to put me on Lovenox while pregnant)  \n\n\nSo, hello - mostly just reading from afar and thankful for everyone for sharing so much and helping me learn and navigate.

I am trying to get my insurance to cover it, but they consider it an \"infertility treatment\" and I have zero infertility coverage. It is a pretty expensive surgery, and we didn't anticipate having to pay for this when we decided to do IVF. \n\nAnyway, I'm just seeing if anyone has any advice for this, or has had any similar experiences.

I have vaginismus, pelvic floor dysfunction and endometriosis. No one except for my husband knows about the vaginismus and pfd. We keep getting asked when we're going to have kids and it's honestly breaking my heart. I'm currently unable to start trying for a baby because my pfd is very severe (all of my muscles in my pelvis are as hard as rocks all the time and I had to have botox and vestibulectomy surgery to even be able to work with my pelvic health physiotherapist). Even when we are able to start trying im unsure about how my fertility is due to my adhesions and endometriosis. I was wondering if it would be okay for me to say that there's an issue with fertility to stop people asking? The reason I am asking is because I don't want to cause any disrespect or pain to this community. My heart aches at every joke about pregnancy, fake pregnancies, unplanned pregnancy, questions we get asked etc. Everyone around us seems to be getting pregnant or having babies and I desperately hope and wish that it was me as I'd love to be a mother. When I found out my sister in law was pregnant I pretended to be happy but as soon as I was alone I cried for days. I feel so isolated and like I'm a horrible person for being jealous and sad at the thought of someone being pregnant or having kids but I'm unsure if I fit in here or anywhere else really but I feel like you will be the only ones who understand.

Turns out he is. Our sperm donor has not taken the medication now for about 5 weeks and we are thinking of trying again. \n\nMy period started today so...if we're doing this, it's GO TIME.\n\nMy question is: should we wait another month? I'm worried because this will likely be our last shot at IVF. However, waiting is very inconvenient as we are moving across the world (Asia to US) in a few months. If we wait, we may very well have to move and leave frozen embryos to be implanted on a later visit. Is it worth it to wait?\n\nThis is so stressful and difficult to decide. I would really love your input, if you have any knowledge of this or just advice on how I should think this through I would be most grateful.\n\nI WISH I knew the name of the hair loss medication he was taking, but his \"hair doctor\" (as he calls him) just gave him some medication, apparently without any proper identification of what was in it.
