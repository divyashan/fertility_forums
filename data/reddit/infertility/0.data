She was incredibly short with me and not at all comforting. I know her job isn't technically to make me feel comfortable, but a little compassion would have been nice. At one point she noted how my legs were shaking, and I told her it was because I was nervous. And she said \"well, I don't know why\" very curtly. Another moment, I winced in pain because my ovaries are gigantic and she pressed against my left one. She asked why I winced and I told her, \"my left ovary hurts.\" So she said, \"well, I'm looking at your uterus [with the ultrasound probe], not your ovary.\"\n\n\n*Well, it still hurts when you rub up against it! I would have said something back, but you want to be nice to the people who have tools in you.*\n\n\nI had only 12 follicles that look like they're growing. In order to take my trigger shot, which prepares my follicles for retrieval 36 hours later, I have to have at least a couple of follicles over 18mm and the rest need to be at least 14mm.\n\n\nToday, most of them were about 12/13mm and the smaller ones were 9mm and above. I had a rogue follicle on my left ovary that was 16mm, so I guess it's more \"ready to go\" than the others.\n\n\nI was told that I need to keep taking my medications and they'll see me again on Wednesday for a third monitoring appointment (bye, $460). I'm guessing they think this will be trigger day.\n\n\nSpeaking of appropriate - at least my hormone levels are appropriate for the 8th day of stimming, and she said that the reason my headaches are so persistent is because my estrogen has tripled from Friday - it's 1227, and on Friday it was 400-something. So, it's only going to get better from here. Ow. Oh, and Ibuprofen is not allowed. My LH and progesterone are low too, so it's a good sign.\n\n\nAnd I gotta tell you - my ovaries are palpable from the inside. I feel like if I move too fast or lay at a weird angle, my ovaries complain. It kind of hurts in there, and the follicles need to grow by 5 or 6mm still. So, as with the estrogen headaches, it's only going to get better from here.\n\n\nI'm a bit disappointed because I thought I would be triggering today to have my retrieval on Wednesday, but I have to wait two more days longer than I hoped. That's 4 more days of headaches, ovary pain, bloating, mood swings, fatigue, etc. Sorry to be a whiner but this isn't the most pleasant thing I've ever gone through...\n\n\nI'm also disappointed because 12 follicles don't seem like a lot, especially when they're only 12/13mm. I have two days to get them up to 18mm? I have my doubts.\n\n\n\nEdit: Also...I'm already having a hard time going to the bathroom, either #1 or #2.

I didn't think I'd get many answers on TFAB since most ladies there are new to all of this, and I also mod /r/ttcafterloss but we're not super active yet. I'm not officially dealing with infertility, but I was wondering if any of you are hypothyroid or been diagnosed with an abnormal uterine shape and could maybe give me more information on how these issues affect TTC, or your personal stories. \n\nFor some background, I'm 28 and my husband is 32. I got pregnant in February 2014 after 4 months of actively trying (plus 2-3 of NTNP). Unfortunately, at our 20 week anatomy scan, we found out our son had kidney defects. It took 7 weeks of flying across the state to see specialists for us to get a clear diagnosis - he had urethral stenosis that led to complete kidney failure. At 27 weeks I had no amniotic fluid left and the doctors told me the prognosis was grave, most likely fatal. We chose to terminate the pregnancy this past August.\n\nWe're now starting our 5th month of TTC after the termination, with no luck so far. Every month since my loss, I've had pain during ovulation - which never occurred before I was pregnant. During my cycles in November and December, the pain lasted from ovulation until my period. It was like a fullness/pressure in my pelvis and sometimes my rectum. My doctor suspected cysts so I had a pelvic ultrasound last month. \n\nThey didn't find any cysts, but the ultrasound showed that my uterus was abnormally shaped - word for word the report says \"there is central indentation of the fundal endometrial cavity representing arcuate or septate uterus - suspect arcuate or subseptate\". My OB said if I'm not pregnant by cycle 8 he would recommend an ultrasound where they inject saline into the uterus to get a better idea of the shape. I still don't know what the pain was from - I don't think abnormal uterine shape causes pain(?). He told me he thinks it was just \"normal ovulation pain\", but I think it's pretty weird that it lasted weeks. Thankfully it didn't happen again this past cycle. \n\nIn addition to that, I have hypothyroidism - Hashimoto's. I've been diagnosed since I was 17. When I got pregnant last year, my levels were normal, but I had to increase my dose quite a bit during the pregnancy. After my loss we had a lot of trouble getting the dose back down to normal so I was technically hyperthyroid for the first 3 cycles of trying. My last blood draw was a couple weeks ago and my t4 was normal (1.5 or so) but my TSH was a bit low (0.4). My doctor decreased my Levothyroxine dose by a little bit and I'll get tested again in a few weeks. \n\nAnyway, I guess I'd like to know if anyone here has dealt with these problems, and if your doctors have told you if they affect fertility or not. I've read that hypothyroidism only affects fertility if your dosage is off - does anyone know if this is true? In that case - what about *overmedicated* hypothyroidism leading to hyperthyroidism? Also, I've read conflicting info on whether or not arcuate uteruses are a medical issue or a normal finding. I know that septate uteruses cause issues with implantation and early miscarriage - so I'm hoping that's not what I have. I know I was pregnant before - but I still worry that perhaps that was a lucky fluke and it'll be harder this time. \n\nAnyway thanks for any information you can provide and thanks for reading. \n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone here with hypothyroidism or an abnormal uterus?

I need all the advice I can get, especially from other women.\n\nBack story: I am 25 years old, in a very stable, good paying job with excellent benefits. I have a wonderful partner of two years who is an attorney and very responsible; we have an amazing condo (rented) and two dogs. We've been looking at homes to buy, talking about getting married and what private schools we want to send our (in the far future) children to. Pretty close to the American dream.\n\nI have always had terrible periods, and all of the women on my mother's side have had horrific problems with their reproductive organs. My great aunt was 17 when she had a full hysterectomy, my mother was 28, my grandmother was 32. All had uterine and ovarian cancers, so obviously I've been more cautious with these issues.\n\nFebruary 2014 I went for my annual exam and told my doctor I had been in a lot more pain than usual around the time of my periods. She ordered an ultrasound that day and found an 11cm cyst on my left ovary. I should remember the type of cyst but I can't at the moment. She said it was the kind that would keep coming back. My main concern was preserving future fertility options, so we decided to wait and check on the cyst in a few weeks. Two weeks later, I could barely get out of bed from the pain. We did another ultrasound and the cyst was now 18cm. She wanted to schedule a laparoscopy right then.\n\nThe first week of April, I had the cyst removed. The recovery sucked, but I was hopeful that I wouldn't be in pain once I healed. After a week or so, I was noticing that the pain was getting much worse, not better. I started throwing up constantly and the bleeding became very heavy. I called my doctor's office and they advised for me to go to the emergency room. I was put on an IV of morphine and promethazine. They did a CAT scan with IV contrast. The on-call OBGYN from my doctor's office also did a physical exam. They said they found a 'fluid packet' where my left ovary was, and it was probably just fluid and blood from the surgery. I was advised to take my pain medication and three days of bed rest. Weeks went by and I was still in a lot of pain and discomfort. I kept calling the doctor's office and they would tell me to go to the ER. I did not want to keep doing that at all. I finally got a doctor's appointment at the end of May. At the appointment, my doctor ordered another ultrasound, and surprisingly 'cyst has already come back'. At this point, it had been only been a month and a half since my surgery to have it removed. Looking back, I should have asked 500 more questions, but I trusted this team of doctors, so I listened to their advice to remove the left ovary and fallopian tube the following week. This recovery was much, much worse. I was in crippling pain for at least two weeks. Again, I apologetically called the doctor's office often, trying to find resolution for why I was in so much pain and throwing up multiple times per day. They kept recommending ER trips. I went to the ER four different times in about four months with the same outcome every time: rest and follow up with your doctor.\n\nFed up with spending an insane amount of money on ER trips to reach no conclusions, I decided to find another OBGYN. Last week was my first appointment, and she ordered an ultrasound. She found a 3cm cyst on my right ovary and 'adenomyosis'. I had never heard of this word before, and she was amazing with my 100 questions. I told her my worries with a cyst on my only remaining ovary, even though it is very small. Her main concern was the adenomyosis, which she said is 'significant'. I asked a lot about how it would affect my future fertility, to which she replied 'we need to get you pregnant'. I told her I wasn't quite ready yet, and still needed a few years until I would be. She said if I wanted to wait longer than ONE year, I needed to look into freezing my eggs. She also said even if I had my eggs frozen (almost $25k), due to the adenomyosis I still might not be able to get pregnant for much longer. She stressed time multiple times.\n\nHere is where I need advice:\n\nMy boyfriend is not ready for a baby. He is likely who I will marry and we want children eventually, but he's terrified at the idea of a child right now. We have little savings and his family would not be thrilled if we rushed this big of a decision. They have always stressed waiting until you're older for children. But...he is 32, I am 25 and we have been together for two years, so it's not like we're teenagers who want a baby. We both have stable careers, make decent money, nice cars, ect.\n\nI completely understand that I could adopt or use a surrogate in the future. And I am more than happy to do that in the future. But I cannot fathom the idea of never being pregnant at least once. Being a mom is the only thing I have ever been sure about wanting in my life, the only thing I want. My entire life, anytime I was asked the cliche 'what do you want to be when you grow up?' My answer was always 'a mom'. I had a very rough childhood in foster care and having my own children was always my silver lining. It was almost my coping mechanism while in horrible situations; that I can give my children a better life. It's also very, very expensive to have eggs frozen, pay for a surrogate to have IVF multiple times and the surrogacy fees. AND give up all control over what they do while pregnant. Similar concerns with adoption. I know this all sounds childish and selfish, but like I said, I just want to be pregnant and give birth one time. I would be thrilled to adopt my second child, and most likely will.\n\nMy other option is using a sperm donor. My boyfriend said he will stay by my side through the entire process, doctor's appointments, ect, but this does not settle right with me. Obviously this is something I need to discuss with him further, but how can this not make me feel terrible? He is willing to play the father role, but not willing to actually father the child? I understand that this all happened less than 24 hours ago, and he hasn't had time to think about it. He's had moments where he's said we will figure it out no matter what, but I can't see a way that I could use a sperm donor and stay with him. There are too many complications. Will the baby call him daddy? Is he going to take on the father responsibilities, like middle of the night diapers? Whose last name will the baby have? What if he has serious regrets when the baby is born that he isn't the biological father? We are too serious for that to work. We have talked about marriage and babies for over a year. I know it would absolutely shatter me the first time he explained to someone that the child wasn't actually his. Again, something we will discuss further, I've just been too much of a mess to do anything but cry.\n\nI don't have a mom to discuss this with.

He now has epilepsy, bipolar, and chemical Parkinson's.  We had an SA done for him in May 2014 which showed low count, motility, and morphology.  Yay.  This past July he became critically ill with a horrible case of c. diff. that caused his bowel to rupture.  While he was in the hospital, he suffered a pulmonary embolism.  He was sent home with a PICC line and a plethora of antibiotics that I had the joy of administering  four times a day.  The day before Halloween he had a colon resection and they removed his sigmoid colon.  He got an infection in his incision, and I got the pleasure of packing that for 4-5 weeks.\n\nAnd I gained 25 pounds.  \n\nI just wanted a break.  \n\nI scheduled my HSG for December 22nd and thought I had it in the bag.  I've never experienced pain during my period before, so I figured I didn't have anything to worry about.  The only pain I've ever had was during ovulation on my left side that my gyno said was totally normal.\n\nSo my RE did the HSG and then wanted to talk with me.  My left tube is completely blocked and my right tube is mostly blocked.  But of course.  That morning I had dropped my husband's sample off to have a repeat SA done.  It was the same as last time.   My RE told me that the next steps would be to have a laparoscopy to see if he could free up anything that might be causing the blockage; if not, the tube is coming out.  He also said, IUI would be our next step after that, assuming that my husband's NEXT semen sample comes back better.  He's hoping that more time away from his illness will help his numbers.  \n\nThere's a lot of if's there.  I just don't know what to think.  IVF isn't an option for us because of money.  So this pretty much just blows.\n\nEdit: words", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "All I wanted was some good news for once...", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2rn99k/all_i_wanted_was_some_good_news_for_once/"}, {"author": "OliveGreen87", "author_created_utc": 1415294977, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "PCOS, closed tubes, MMF.

Any preference, ladies? \n\nAlso, any calming words would be so, so, so appreciated.

I'm just kind of starting this whole process, and today has been a rough day.  Some background - hubs (35) and I (33) tried for two years.  Total failure.  I lost my job and we moved cities, so we decided to put things off a bit.  I went on Paraguard IUD for two years.  I had that pulled in September.  After talking to my doctor and a few more months of failure, I was given an HSG and sent to a reproductive endocrinologist.  HSG found issues.  RE found PCOS (it explains so much! Why did no one tell me before?!).  After meeting repeatedly with the RE, we've decided to skip IUI and go straight to IVF - the RE thinks that I would be very unlikely to conceive using IUI and there's no reason to waste our limited funds, right?  \n\nNow I'm waiting.  I don't have a protocol.  I'm not on birth control, which is the next step.  I am on metformin, which I started right before Christmas.  The whole thing starts when I reach \"full flow\" in my cycle.  I started spotting yesterday, and then it went completely away today.  It's the lightest period I have had in my entire life.  Of course, right?  Ever since I had the IUD removed, my periods have gotten lighter and lighter.  Maybe it's my body making up for how heavy they were when I was on the IUD, but this is almost pure insanity.  And of course the Endocrinologist is still out on winter vacation, so the nurses are having to find another doctor who has time to read my chart and figure out what to do.  \n\nI'm not totally sure why I'm posting.  Mostly because no one I know has gone through this.  I really have no clue what to expect.  I have no clue if I'm doing things right.  I know there will be a bunch of pills and shots and so on, but I'm pretty clueless otherwise.

I handled it well. No breakdown or freak out. We had a game plan for Letrozole, Ovidrel, and progesterone suppositories and knowing that kept me feeling confident. We finally started treatment this month when my period finally decided to show up (40-75 cycle, never know what you're gonna get). \n\nLetrozole sucked.\nOvidrel sucked.\nThese suppositories suck.\n\nSo. Many. Fucking. Side effects. I was emotional, I had a headache for almost a week straight. Diarrhea. Hot flashes. Cramping. The list goes on with each new drug. I'm 12 days past my trigger and got a negative this morning. I'll test again tomorrow but honestly, it's probably still a negative...and I'm already fed up. I don't know how some of you do this long term and stay sane. I feel weak and insecure for feeling like \"why the fuck should I go on with this shit??\". I know it'll be worth it once you get that positive. But what if it never comes? All that stress. All those hormones. All those side effects from treatments. For how long? Months? Years? Until you lose your mind?\n\nSo I finally had my first cry about all of this since the diagnosis from the RE. I'm stressed and scared about the uncertainty of all of this. I like plans and this is all a shot in the dark. So, I've been having a nice long cry all night. My poor, poor husband. He has no idea what to tell me.\n\nSo, what do I do next? Take a couple months off to catch my breath and mentally prepare for doing this long term? But who has time to waste when your body fucking hates you and won't work? So do I move on with treatment again whenever my next cycle shows up and just learn to deal with this emotional roller coaster? \n\nAgain, I see how long some of you go through this and I'm in awe. You are so strong. I'm can't believe I'm feeling so \"done\" with it so quickly. \n\nI guess it doesn't help that my career is that of a birth professional and so it all feels like a huge slap in the face every time I see my pregnant clients. Oh the irony of it all.\n\nI guess I don't know what I'm even asking. Is this normal to feel after the first month? Overwhelmed. Stressed. Scared. Wanting to quit before you've barely even begun. \n\nBlegh. Word (paragraphs) vomit. Sorry. My husband is just speechless and says he'll support whatever I decide but he admits it's hard for him to understand/empathize with what I'm going through, which is why I'm reaching out to you all. I think he'd rather keep his mouth shut than say the wrong thing. Good man. He just holds my hand and let's me cry, and I'm okay with that for now. \n\nUPDATE:\nWow. I'm blown away.  Your responses have been so very helpful in my processing all of this.  Taking the time to respond with such kind words and genuine support is so unbelievably helpful right now as I really have no friends to talk to about all of this.  I think I needed this \"blow\" to force me to process this diagnoses and to acknowledge what it could really mean for me and my husband.  I am so, so thankful for your words and will be taking the next few days to process &amp; decide what we'll do next.  I know I'm not ready to give up, I just don't know that I'm ready to move on so quickly.  Maybe a few months off is in order.  We shall see. \n\nAgain, thank you.  This community has been, not only educational as I still learn about this process, but also so freeing to know that when I'm feeling like I'm losing my mind, there's a place I can go where I know I won't be judged and told to \"just stop stressing\".

After lurking around here for a while, I decided to just take the plunge and introduce myself. My husband and I will be 28 this year and we've been trying since May 2013. \n\nAfter six months of trying, I went to my OBGYN with concerns. I told her that I thought maybe I had an LP defect (I was charting at the time and it seemed I only got about 8-10 days every month.) She didn't want to hear that and ordered CD 3 testing on me...on the 10th day. When I raised concerns, she basically said I didn't know what I was talking about. She then ordered a SA on my husband. \n\nThat night, I posted in Facebook that I wanted to another OBGYN because I wasn't happy with my current one. Well, when I went back to get my test results, she basically went off about how much it hurt her feelings because I wanted to find another doctor. UM WHAT? Anyway, she said I was fine but my husband was not and that we needed to see a urologist because she couldn't help me. \n\nWell, I looked up his results and...they seemed to be fine. I then made an appointment with an RE because this wackadoodle would not be any help. \n\nFast forward a couple of months and we finally got into the RE's office. My husband's SA IS fine, so now we're looking at me. I've had an HSG--fine. My testing, though on the wrong day, didn't raise any alarms. I _am_ ovulating on my own, so that's go too. I'm just not getting pregnant.\n\nWe did one round of Femara + ovidrel. When I went in, I had a follicle that was  20mm, but my lining was only 5mm. So he immediately started me on estradoil. But I didn't even make it to my testing date. I started my period early. I was completely and totally devastated. That was back in July. For a while, I didn't want to try again. I had just given up. But in December, we went back to discuss what happened. My RE now thinks that there may be an issue with my estrogen levels because of my low BMI (18) which is making for a poor ovulation and lining. We were supposed to do another medicated cycle before Christmas, but I decided to wait because I just started a new teaching job and the stress would have been too much. \n\nNow, I just keep flopping between being hopeful (the RE will start me on estradoil sooner in the cycle, and he's splitting up the Femara instead of doing a massive dose like the first time) and becoming more and more concerned about never conceiving. We don't have a real reason. Everything is guess work. Even with spending $900 every medicated cycle, we only have a 20% chance of becoming pregnant. Time is ticking. We're getting older. I always wanted at least two children, and now I don't even know if I'll get one. \n\nWhich brings me to the question I hate: \"So. Do you have children?\" \n\"Nope.\" \n\"Oh, well, so do you WANT children?\"\n\n...why do people find this appropriate?! I just can't understand the constant bombardment of questions dealing with such a personal aspect of someone's life. And if people find out you can't get pregnant? Oh.

We got there and waited for a total of 5 minutes before we were led into a room where I could change into a backless gown, a hair net, and some booties. Husband snapped a couple of pictures of me like this and got a little choked up, seeing that this big thing was really happening. I was too nervous at the moment to get choked up. Then they took him away to contribute to his half.\n\nThe nurses brought me into a little area with a nice recliner and took my vitals and double-checked I had no medicine allergies. I made idle chat with a couple of different ladies (I couldn't tell them apart because each one was dressed in scrubs, hair nets and a mask) and one of them hooked me up to an IV, which was truly the most painful part of this whole thing. My hand...ouch. They pumped some anti-nausea meds through and some form of advil and an antibiotic. \n\nMy doctor came in and quickly summarized what they would be doing (I already knew) and told me she'd call me today (Saturday) to tell me how many eggs fertilized. Then the nurses all escorted me into the rather intimidating operating room and had me lay down on the table.\n\n\"Okay, we're going to put some anesthesia through now.\" Someone said. The ceiling tiles and florescent lights began to spin. I asked if they were aware that that was happening, and that's the last thing I remember before someone was waking me up. I asked if they started yet and they said they were already done. This made me laugh pretty hysterically (apparently it's normal for women to be laughing or crying when they wake up). \n\n**Then someone told me I had 20 eggs retrieved!** I sat in the recovery chair and kind of drifted off again before they let me go get dressed. I met up with Bill and a nurse and they gave us some post-op instructions. My teeth wouldn't stop chattering, and they said it was from the anesthesia. \n\nI was also in no pain! I'm having a lot of the symptoms I read about....bloating and constipation most notably. I've taken everything under the sun (colace, miralax, like 10 prunes) to help the latter problem but no dice. If it wasn't for that, I'd probably feel more comfortable.

My husband has an autoimmune disorder that was treated with cyclophosphomide (an intense chemotherapy he took orally for a year). Now married 5 plus years, his sperm was tested and he is completely sterile. His FSH levels show he is most likely not producing sperm. Our only option is a TESE surgery in which they extract testicular tubules and scrape them out and search for sperm. If any are found,  they are frozen and given to me via IVF. \n\nOur chances of finding any are so low they actually discouraged the surgery but my husband is adamant. He won't move on to adoption unless he knows for sure, but I am afraid (and certain) that his grieving process will begin all over again if nothing is there. Anyone had a similar experience? \n\nI'm also dealing with my brother and sister in law telling me that they know how we feel because they might not be able to have kids either. This is NOT true. She was discouraged from trying while treating an illness with a particular medicine. Basically,  she has to wait a few months to begin trying. I clarified this with her.

My ob sent me to an IVF center, and they put me through the wringer, test after test. Our final diagnosis was \"unexplained infertility\". They never set us up with a plan or resolution to get pregnant, and it kinda feels like they shrugged their shoulders and wished us their best. I finally bit the bullet and went to another specialist in September and about 5 minutes into the exam, I was diagnosed with endometriosis and my Dr. planned for me to proceed with IVF. It's been a roller coaster since then, dealing with insurance and having to change doctors. I just want to stop going for tests and get the show on the road already. Lord, give me patience. I've seen my new Dr. enough times already that I could drive to the office with my eyes closed. He's got the same idea, skip surgery to remove the cysts (I had an unexplained dvt about 8 years ago) but with all the new blood tests, there always seems to be something else that's just \"not quite right\". I'm waiting on an appointment with a hematologist as a consultant, I need to go for an mri so my Dr. can get a better look at my ovaries- I might wind up needing surgery anyway (que the stress) and the date of my actual procedure has gone from November to hypothetically February now.

I just don't know where else to go and I'm going out of my mind needing advice. \n\nFor some background, I'm 36. We started trying after we got married 15 years ago. We did all the usual things, charts, ovulation indicators, turning the bed south all that jazz. After a year of no baby we sought medical advice and went through all the tests. Turns out there's no reason at all I wasn't pregnant his swimmers were Olympic quality, I'm ovulating and its a clear run through the fallopian tubes. we were 'diagnosed' with unexplained infertility. I think that made it worse, if I'd been told there was no hope whatsoever I'd have given up then and there, if I'd had something more concrete like PCOS I could have looked into it, but for it to be just a big mystery we were left in limbo for years. Suffice to say, no miracle baby ever arrived.\n\nNothing worked and about 6 years ago we put those dreams aside, reluctantly, but we grew to embrace our life to the point where we now feel too old and too established for a baby. I thought I was over it until yesterday. \n\nBack in my 20s I'd been part of a support group, eventually I left, partly because I'd moved on and partly because it felt like every other week someone had a surprise baby. one of the women ended up pregnant after 4 IVF cycles when she was in her 30s. she's closer to 40 now and just called me in tears because she'd had a miscarriage. she hadn't even known she was pregnant and had never thought she'd be able to get pregnant without heavy medical intervention. I'm devastated for her of course, but all I keep coming back to is the fact that I've never been pregnant. I'll never get as a far as a miscarriage because for some reason I'm a natural warzone for embryos. I don't know why this is bothering me so much and I don't know who else to talk to. I tried talking to my parents and they accused me of being happy she's lost the baby. That's ludicrous but I can't explain why when I'd come to terms with never being a mother I'm suddenly in pieces about the fact that i'll never know what it feels like to have a positive test or even to have a baby then lose it. obviously I don't mean I want a miscarriage I just mean I feel like every one else is at least getting a false start when I can't even make it onto the tracks. \n\ncan anyone give me some perspective?
