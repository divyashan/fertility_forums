That was the final straw and I went on BC at 17 to manage it. \nNow, 4 years later, I\u2019ve been dealing with chronic GI issues for well over a year. I thought I had IBS because everything I ate left me bloated and in pain. I was just diagnosed with SIBO two weeks ago and that can apparently be caused by OCPs, so I quit taking them. However, in reading a thread on this sub some people mentioned the exact GI symptoms I had chalked up to IBS as endo signs- sensitivity to things like garlic, constipation, and bloating. \nThis week I had my first post-OCP period and I\u2019m terrified. The pain was so awful I was doubled over, shaking, and thought I was going to vomit. I\u2019m fairly certain I blacked out in the shower again because i found myself on the tub floor with no memory of getting there. \nSo. I\u2019m back to wondering if I have endo and, if so, what to do.

I love reading support networks like this that bring people together.\n\nAs a musician, I was thinking to myself that I can't recall ever hearing a song about the topic of infertility. So, I took it upon myself to write one, to vent the frustration. My wife also sings in the song with me and it turns into a duet of sorts. \n\nThe song is called \"Lullaby To Nobody\", and here is a link to the YouTube lyric video for the song: https://youtu.be/OHNcs6GusZk\n\n\nIf you'd like to listen on Spotify, here is the link for my album: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3QDZfAu8fsRxb8BhsbgEzB?si=saGhzTlPS1esXEwTB7V9WQ\n\n\nBest of luck to everyone out there with this difficult situation in these difficult times.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 17203, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I wrote a song to try to cope with infertility called \"Lullaby to Nobody\"", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ft6ige/i_wrote_a_song_to_try_to_cope_with_infertility/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HAYYme", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "36F, 6 IUIs, 3 IVFs (w/3rd MMC @ 7w), going for #4", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4y3qv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1585770580, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ft77by/free_menopur_and_follistim_durham_nc/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ft77by", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ft77by/free_menopur_and_follistim_durham_nc/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1585770586, "score": 1, "selftext": "I think I'm ready to part with my leftover meds.

pictures happy things - typically it's 95% pets and 5% kids. But now that everyone is working from home because of COVID-19, there's been way more going on in that channel, and people (fairly) want to post more to try to boost each other's happiness. There is the odd pregnancy announcement - it's usually an image of a sonogram. I know that I might see that when I go to that channel, so it's fine. I'm prepared for kids and possibly a sonogram pregnancy announcement! But what I'm not prepared for is a five minute long video this guy posted of him and his wife opening an envelope that said \"it's a girl!\" A freaking gender reveal video in my workplace slack. He didn't say that that's what the video was, so of course I watched it, having no idea what it was. Him and his wife are SO happy in it, like so incredibly, authentically happy, and then after they opened the envelope they had this kind of drawn out kiss. That's the point where I figured it was getting kind of inappropriate for this to be posted in a workplace slack. Instagram, sure. Not at work though.\n\nAnyway, a bunch of people reacted saying congrats, while I descended into a meltdown that lasted the rest of the day, and into the next morning. I feel like I put up so many guardrails to make sure this doesn't happen - I think we all do! I unfollow pregnant friends on instagram, I have the word \"baby\" and \"babies\" muted on twitter - I do all these things so that I can keep my grief over my infertility in a little box that I only go into sometimes with my partner and every week in therapy. So that I can perform at my job and keep my mental health together on a daily basis. And then some dumb thing like this just breaks that box wide open and I'm an epic mess.\n\nI tried to talk to my best friend about it and she absolutely did not get it, and basically said that this was maybe a little weird in a workplace Slack but ultimately not something I could expect to not see. I know that I can't expect people to know that 1 in 8 couples experience infertility and that just *maybe* there's someone in this nearly 200 people workplace that doesn't want to see your gender reveal. I know that my desire to never see those things is unreasonable, but I just wanted her to say \"ugh that sucks, f\\*ck that guy!\" anyway. So, I'm posting it here. I'm still upset about it. Have a freaking disclaimer or better yet, don't assume that your co-workers, who have *not* opted into these sorts of emotional videos the way your instagram followers have, want to see something like this.

I was directed here after spiraling into a near-meltdown after one of my friends announced she was pregnant after only trying for about a year and a half and desperately trying a chat/pseudotherapy site. There's more there, but we'll start with the backstory. If my username didn't tip you off, I'm bitter at this point, so this post will be salty as hell. Read at your own risk.\n\nI am 35, married to my husband 11 years last month, and we've been trying to have a baby for those entire 11 years. After about 4 years, in 2013, we thought something might be wrong because we were young and healthy and wtf why wasn't anything happening. I did all the painful testing first, ready to accept that if the issue was with me, we'd adopt and I'd be fine with that. Everything came back clean.\n\nMy husband went to get a semen analysis done. The call came back later \"Congratulations! The vasectomy worked!\"\n\n...What?\n\nThat's not what we ordered. Send it back. I don't want that.\n\nQueue husband going to a male fertility specialist who prescribes testosterone, orders a varicocele surgery, and generally screws with my husbands hormones until we get some results. We get marginal results, but it's something.\n\nQueue researching fertility treatments and finding out that 1. they are damn expensive and 2. most insurances cover exactly nothing about them, including ours.\n\nWe scrimped, we saved, we raided husband's retirement account, and 2ish years ago we were able to start fertility treatments, in lieu of making a down payment on a house.\n\nWe went straight to IVF and ICSI and after the first batch of 2 FETs were negative, we now do PGS testing as well. Our second batch resulted in 3 (chromosomally) normal embryos, of which 2 disintegrated upon thawing, and the third resulted in our third negative. That was a blow and resulted in us taking a year off to build up funds for the meds and get some mental health back. This last batch resulted in 2 normal embryos, one of which was transferred at the end of January and came back negative just in time for husband's birthday. Fun.\n\nThe fertility people suggested an ERA, which I did at the beginning of March. The results came just before everything shut down, the same day in fact. They called to tell me they were implanting at the incorrect time for my body and that they'd be ready for next time, and then later called to say that the office building they were located was closing indefinitely. So yay.\n\nSo back to my friend. She was finding out that she was pregnant about the time that we were getting our 4th negative. I'm happy for her, but she's the nth one since we've started this mess and I'm so tired of it. My cousins have had children, my brother (who I thought never would) has had a child, a girl who started fertility stuff the same time as me has had her baby, hell, I've had kids I *babysat* get married and have kids!\n\nI'm just hoping to find some support here. My family is great, but I haven't told anyone besides my immediate family because they can be over-bearing and just *do not* understand the struggle.

Where both embryos implanted. Very high HCG levels. Found out at 6 week, 3 day ultrasound that baby B was a blighted ovum. Found out that 8 1/2 week ultrasound which was supposed to be my final one with RE before I graduated  that baby A who had heartbeat of 133 the week before was only measuring at 7 weeks 1 day, and had no heartbeat. Was supposed to get D&amp;C two days later, but was postponed due to covid19. Doctor at group practice told me I could wait to miscarry naturally until D&amp;C. 2 weeks later a different doctor at the practice called me out of the blue and told me I needed to take misoprostol immediately because it wasn't good to wait this long and now nonessential surgeries have been cancelled indefinitely. I took two doses of misoprostol and nothing happened. No cramping, spotting etc. A couple of days later spotting started, and I've had on and off light bleeding (more than spotting as I need a pad, but way lighter than normal period for me) for 5 days now.\n\nMy question is anyone know what my next steps are. I was told that the meds can take a week to work which today is a week and to call on Monday if it still hasn't happened. I'm at what would be 11 weeks. My mom, SIL, and MIL all told me that my twins are still alive, and my body would miscarry if they weren't. This is really upsetting to me. I want children so bad, and they're making me feel like I'm choosing to lose them. I think this is because  they never had to go through fertility treatment and didnt realize that miscarriages are often \"missed.\" I trust that they aren't viable as I go to an RE with excellent equipment, and had seen the heartbeat easily 2 weeks in a row and then couldn't. Plus she stopped growing.\n\nI'm just scared as the one doctor said that it wasn't good to wait this long, and surgery is not an option and the pills arent working. One of the doctors at the practice said if I get past 12 weeks ( this will mark 4 weeks of waiting for natural) and go to an emergency room I might find one that will consider it an emergency and do a D&amp;C. I really don't want to go to a hospital because A. I don't want to take supplies and the bed from someone that really needs it. B. I'm in Jersey which has been hit really bad. The first cases in my county were actually attributed to staff that worked at my local hospital. I really don't want to go to a hospital and put myself and family at risk of getting COVid19. \n\nAny ideas or suggestions for questions I could ask on Monday or possible next steps are welcome.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 17218, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "TW: Miscarriage question", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/fus8hl/tw_miscarriage_question/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "aaanderson2020", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5lll4l5m", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1586007448, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/futuac/unexplained_infertility/", "gildings": {}, "id": "futuac", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 31, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/futuac/unexplained_infertility/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1586007450, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nMy husband and I have been dealing with unexplained infertility for about 1.5 years.

Feel free to skip the first paragraph below, it's just a bit of history. Felt I should give a bit of background for those that might be interested in a man's perspective of male infertility.\n\nThese past few years have been the most painful years for my wife and I. It started like everyone else, try every month and hope for that positive pregnancy test. It never came. Then came the initial testing, everything with my wife was good. Me on the other hand, zippo, no sperm. A second analysis and the same result. Then came the blood tests, physical exams, and genetic testing, everything was normal. Finally after 18 months of trying and going through testing we discovered a vesicle cyst, a blockage. We decided to perform a single micro-TESE tissue sample at the same time of the cyst aspiration; unfortunately, the tissue sample netted zero sperm. The cyst aspiration didn't change anything either. I schedule the final surgery I would have, a full on TESE. Prior to the surgery though I went on clomid and HCG injections for two months. Studies in Europe have shown both drugs to have a boost in sperm production. Sadly the world came crashing down, the surgery complete and the realization that I was diagnosed with sertoli cell only syndrome. That was it, the realization hit that I would never have a biological child.\n\nIt's become clear to me as I deal through these struggles that most infertility sources are geared towards woman. Men seem to hide their emotions and refuse to open up about their struggles. The question I have this evening for everyone who have gone through a similar ordeal and have gone the sperm donor route is how did you, or your husband, deal with the emotional aspect? Call me crazy, but COVID-19 happened at a convenient time. Don't get me wrong, I feel horrible such a terrible pandemic is affecting the entire world, but on a selfish side I'm happy it buys us, and mostly me, time to deal with the emotional stress of not being able to have a child (genetically speaking). I thought I prepared myself for the inevitable bad news from my latest surgery, obviously I didn't prepare at all since the devastation doesn't seem  to vanish despite how open I am about the struggles and the support network we've built.\n\nAny insight on dealing with male infertility, sperm donor (IUI), or anything else you think would help my wife and I would be greatly appreciated. I hate that this subreddit even exists, I wish infertility was something none of us had to deal with.

Mentions of pregnancy loss and/or negative results are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area.*\n\n*Mention of children is a touchy subject in this forum.  Previous success may be discussed in neutral language, sensitive language, when relevant to the context of an intro or answering a question about a particular protocol that lead to success.

I was told that it was 20. \n\nMy husband then had to work interstate for the first half of 2019 so we took a 6 month break from TTC. We started trying again in June 2019.\n\nFast forward to early 2020, my husband has his sperm tested and has low count and poor morphology and motility.

I understand that this is low for my age but generally not the worst level by any means. However, the clinic told me they wanted to refer me to a specialist right away due to the fact my AMH dropped by over 50% in little more than a year. They told me they are unable to start an ivf cycle though.\n\nI\u2019m absolutely terrified that if clinics have to remain closed for a lengthy period of time my AMH will continue to plummet. I have absolutely no idea why it\u2019s deceased at such a rapid rate. I\u2019m scared that by the time I can actually start ivf I\u2019ll have no eggs or very few eggs remaining. \n\nIve been able to make an appointment at another clinic who at this stage is still treating patients, but who knows how long they will be permitted to continue. \n\nHas anyone had anything similar happened with huge decrease in egg reserve?

I am a 20 yr old female, single and not trying for a baby but I\u2019m certain I am infertile for one reason or another. I have been with a few different partners over the course of 5 years. When I was in high school my boyfriend at the time gave me chlamydia and I didn\u2019t know for about 9 months. I know this can scar your fallopian tubes and make it difficult to get pregnant. I\u2019ve never used any protection and always let my partners cum inside of me. I feel like if it were going to be easy I would have been pregnant by now. I\u2019ve looked into all other possible explanations and feel maybe the only other possibility is endometriosis? I also know that ovarian cancer is common on my moms side of the family. I cant afford health insurance and I\u2019m wondering if its worth paying out of pocket to talk to a specialist about this? It seems like prices vary so much depending on all sorts of things and I dont have a ton of extra money but not knowing weighs on my mental health and I get so sad and emotional thinking about it. I dont know if Im being ridiculous but I dont wanna wait till Im ready to have kids if there\u2019s anything I can be doing differently now. I remember talking to my primary care doctor about this when I was 18 and she pretty much ignored my concerns because of my age and I dont want to be treated like that by another doctor. Im not ready for children but I get sad/ angry when I see announcements, hear people complain about their kids, etc. Thank you in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 17228, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "infertility rant/is it worth going to a doctor?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/fwp86i/infertility_rantis_it_worth_going_to_a_doctor/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
