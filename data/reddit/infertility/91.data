We just had our meeting with the RE yesterday to discuss the first round of testing. I\u2019ve been off birth control since June and we had our first appointment with RE on 1/31. \nI only have one ovary (probably congenital) and that ovary had a 10 cm cyst removed in 2015. So we were pretty sure that\u2019s the problem. Sure enough at my first baseline ultrasound the RE found a 3.5cm cyst taking up 95% of the total surface area on my ovary. She could only see 2 follicles. Thankfully my AMH was higher than predicted at 0.9. And my husbands SA had good results. \nThe RE is recommending IVF lite to get more info about whether I can juice up enough follicles to actually use my own eggs. Depending on what she learns from that cycle will decide next steps. It seems like success from this is slim and she was pretty clear that there is very little chance we will have multiples successes without donor eggs. \nI\u2019m pretty numb right now but this is very far away from what we hoped. Like a couple of idiots we went into this pretty sure that we didn\u2019t want to use donor material. Now I just feel lost. We\u2019re also paying for all of this OOP because my insurance doesn\u2019t cover anything. We are very lucky to be able to get financing on terms we can handle, but obviously adding donor eggs will be a big cost. \nSorry for the long winded intro. I just feel so sad and uncertain of what happens next. Anyone else in the same boat medically? I read some older posts on mini IVF, assuming that\u2019s the same as IVF lite? Anyone going through that now with tips/ commiseration? Weirdly it gives me comfort to think about it as just another testing cycle rather than a possibly successful treatment.

I'm sorry that it is so lenghty. I promise I will never make so many words again. I am just so aroused and confused, that it is still hard to condense it. \n\nI guess most will get the point pretty soon, it's just a assembly of stories happening over a time. Thank you very much in advance for any kind word. I hope I find some people who understand here. \n\nIt is somehow a case of social infertility. \n\nBeing forty and wanted to have a kid. The last relationship broke because of this. This is 3 1/2 year ago now and that happened: \n\nAs far as I knew we loved each other dearly. And I've been never told anything else by him or any bystander. Everybody told us that we should be so thankful for what we had. So the break up had to be done and given the tragic situation, I of course assumed supportive bahaviour and assuring we both would come out well of this. I thought this was naturalas we loved each other.\n\nThis didn't happen. I made my best not to hurt him (he had pre-existing wounds of being left for someone else) and even give him another half year of mine, in which I gave us time to slowely grow apart, to not make it too hard and pay respect to each others feelings. He started to be strange, asked for another talk about our chances, we might have. We met, he was strangely and massively cold, suddenly told me I'd likely have disabled children and that this was a reason to not have kids together. I was in state of shock. Really. Extremely confused and helpless among the monster that was sitting in front of me, that I used to love really dearly.\n\nIt went on like this. Snapped at me. 'I'm sorry if I don't think about you all the time' after I sent him happy christmas wishes. Coincidentally met, he hold me tight so long, would'nt let go. Then: 'Sorry, there are no feelings anymore.' Then again cried on my sofa.\n\nA friend of him put me down so cruel. Told me I had no right to be sad.\n\nThat was a mayor life crisis already and I needed all my strength to cope with that and bring it to an good end. And my time was valuable.\n\nI was so massively confused by this unreflective, hurtful behaviour. Meanwhile my father had a brain stroke two days before christmas. I was so broken, tried to stand upright for my parents.\n\nSecond stroke, third stroke, fourth stroke, that crazy friend told me, he would be there to help me with my father, but not with my grieve about the love lost. As if I had to be punished. For what? \n\n4 months go by. I was still waiting for my ex to come to a somewhat normal behaviour again, nothing was more important to me as to keep this relationship. It's an awful choice to make between someone you love and kids.                                                                                                                                                      \nWe meet and he tells me he has someone knew. No warning. No sensitivity towards me. No cooperation. I'm so blindsided. He doesn't want to tell me who. He gets quite squishy and I am  dumbfounded.\n\nFinally: it's the girl he met two weeks prior our break-up, who heavily hit on him and strangely bitched on me, whom we brought home and smirked her goodbye and texted him right the next morning. (We never ever encountered something like that before! That's for me a situation, you undoubtably are loyal to your partner. ) About whom he repeatedly, before and after the break up told me, NOT TO WORRY!! I addressed this several times. \n\nShocked I ask since when, he tells something like a month. That is highly untrustworthy. This completely unreliable behaviour. I feel blindsided and gaslighted, but I am not the person to get aggressive. I was just so hurt by this, I was numb.\n\nAgain he is quite crazy. He is telling me he is happy. Then freaking as I use the word 'we' (for my sister and me) . 'Who do you mean with 'we'?' And he wants to be friends !!!!\n\nI wanted that all the time. I did everything for that. He comes there, acting like the most irresponsible and unrespectful person I can imagine. Of course that mf had not even made that clear to his girlfriend, that he wanted to meet me. He told her once and she to no much surprise freaked out.\n\nThat was against my pride to meet with someone who has treated me like that and then also betray his new girlfriend. I also felt that he is by no means reliable for me and I would again awfully get hurt, when this woman would demand that we cancel contact.\n\nThe level of hurt of love and betrayal of friendship and decency I felt at this day was the most awful feeling I ever felt.\n\nI lost it all. I lost this big love and he suddenly developed into an awful enemy. Who hit me to the core. I lost the appreciation I thought he had for me ( don't know, up to this day, everyfuckinbody tells me so). I lost the reliable, cheering friend. I was constantly endangered to lose my father.\n\nFacing a very difficult situation. Full of fear of not having a child. This fear is so painful. Some can understand, a lot of people mock you because of this. \n\nBut the most awful thing was, that I was in incredible disbelief and insecurity about what had happened? Did he even betray me to weeks prior our break up? Did she interfere with his decision. The disrespect to mingle a old love with a new. In such a situation. With so much lying and playing going on. This selfishness. Was our love worth anything? The brainfuck was so cruel. Given all the month prior, my energy to fight the emotions was consumed. He refused to talk to me after that and give me any true information.\n\nI broke down, called suicide hotline, was brought into a hospital, managed to be let out, asked a friend of him for help. Guy told me: yeah, they were hookin up one weak after the break up. That's what he knew. God knows what really happend. Apparentely I was supposed to shrug this off.\n\nI begged him to help me with a clarification as I needed to go on with my life! He refused. My time was running. I was desperate. depressive, on tranquilizers.\n\nI have been a normal person before.\n\nThese people consider such a behaviour as normal. I don't. She is an adult ministrant. No lie. A ministrant. A ministrant who shamelessly interferes with a relationship when it comes to having children. And I was supposed to be cold-hearted rational following through with life.  My values are deeply infringed and thus I feel. I got ridiculed, lied to, played with, all to his good, his feelings count, mine don't, does he act unreliable, it is his hurt feelings. I shall stand over this and not complain. After all I want the children! That he couldn't decide for that, seems irrelevant and natural. It was nobodies fault. You want kids or you don't. Nobody was hustled. The decisions were respected.\n\nI felt so deeply betrayed, I,  who had no time, gave him time after the break up and what I got back was being blindsided and played with. Denied clear information and ridiculed me and more or less told me to act like a woman my age should.\n\nNext christmas after a year of developing depression and breakdowns, trying to stand up again, cancer of the bladder was detected in my father. Bigger than a fist. Operation, bladder out. Spring: cancer of the lung. Operation, chemo, radio, immunetherapy. We are fighting all the time. I was still deeply lovesick and disbelief. A devastation that comes when you feel betrayed by humans in general. The hurt, the lack of cooperativeness and basic friendliness and decency in difficult times. I once more got weak and asked for a helping talk. This time I got back a cowboy smiley. A cowboy smiley! This man called me the best friend he ever had. My faith in humans is shredded. My faith in love and friendship is shredded.\n\nAfter I complained a bit, I got a rant and he told me he doesn't care and has long forgotten this and I shouldn't fantasize this much.\n\nOf course I was not able to build a new relationship. 7 month ago, I finally decided to get a sperm donor. They don't treat single woman here. It's super expensive. I have to go abroad. Some of you surely know:it's a massive strain to hope every month, to endure, that if that asshole wouldn't have treated me like shit, I could have way easier get pregnant at 38. \n\nI want to die. I beg to die and feel so guilty towards the people that love me. I seriously feel so wrong on this earth, so wrong between so called friends. I can't get over this cruelty. This lack of respect for very important life goals. I try to walk on, but I'm a shell and my most private feelings have been constantly devalued and ridiculed.\n\nThank you. I know. Awfully long. I could have been a happy person. I had interest in life and I cared for humans. I cared to raise a child and make it happy.\n\nThank you very very much for reading. Advice and support much needed.

I felt like I needed to tell my story for hope that it would help someone in their journey or after getting some bad news. This isn\u2019t a pity post if anything it\u2019s a story for closure and I hope that someone who is going through a similar story will see it that way too.\n\nBackground: I am 31 and my husband is 32 we are both incredibly healthy we started trying in late 2015 then moved to IUI for two years in 2017 then started IVF cycles end of 2019. My cycle is perfect I never miss a beat, every 26 days, my husbands count and motility is great. We just fell into the \u201cunexpected\u201d trap doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what was happening. I never once had a positive test, never had a miscarriage, no chemical pregnancy. Nothing. \n\nSo during our ivf, first round got cancelled I only produced 4 potential follicles and doctor said they can\u2019t move forward with 4 since the embryo would not make it to day 6. So they bumped my meds up to the highest dose and still only produced 4 and the other follicles were actually less this time around. After some further tests the doctor determined that my egg reserve is running out and the quality of my eggs are not good anymore (I\u2019m 31 for crying out loud). So with this news the doctor confirmed that the only other option is using someone else\u2019s eggs, pay for donated embryos or adoption. \n\nI never thought of the day where I would get a \u201cyou can\u2019t have kids\u201d answer, it came out of nowhere and was not expecting that at age 31. It was devastating and was not sure how to process it in the doctors office. I was in shock, I couldn\u2019t believe it. All this time I thought alright ivf medicine and done let\u2019s do it! I\u2019m still young, I have control over this. But nope, I have no control over this and whatever my fate is. \n\nI\u2019m still processing this news, it\u2019s incredibly hard to think that I won\u2019t ever have kids of my own but slowly I am coming to that idea and I\u2019m okay with it. One thing that I think is very important is to not put so much pressure on yourself. It\u2019s okay. I know it\u2019s easier said than done, but honestly what control do you have? Ultimately, if it is not meant to be then it won\u2019t happen. No reason to keep yourself in a depressed state, just move on to what your fullest potential in life will be. I think once I grasp onto that it will feel good. It\u2019s hard thinking of my life without kids because I have been thinking for 30 years that my life will include kids and now that was torn away from us, just like that, in a 10 minute conversation 30 years of having the idea of a kid is erased. CRAZY!! But now that door is closed and to be honest I\u2019m relieved. Is that weird? Maybe We started preparing ourselves to move on a few months back which I think helped with being blindsided yesterday. \n\nSo, why am I telling my story? I just hope that this can bring an ounce of hope to those who get the same news as me, it\u2019s devastating and comparable to a death, a baby that you never can have. Which when you say it like that, is incredibly painful, but now know that, this door is closed and you can move towards your fullest potential in life without kids or whatever that is meant for you. As hard as that is saying it out loud, it\u2019s okay. Embrace what you have in front of you. I know through this journey me and my husband have been closer than ever before, I would marry him all over again with no regrets. I\u2019m so happy that he keeps assuring me that it\u2019s okay, he is with me for me, and that I can\u2019t beat myself up for it because I can\u2019t fulfill my duty as a woman. Now I understand what it means for women to have super powers, lol as cheesy as that is, having a baby grow inside you and develop into a human being is truly a miracle. The fact that naturally, you have a 20% chance every month of becoming pregnant is so small! \n\nTo anyone out there going through such pain like this, just take it one day at a time. Just know you are so incredibly strong for burdening this pain. In a weird way, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, I feel like I can move on and close this chapter, knowing that I have a healthier marriage now than 5 years ago. It\u2019s so important to keep communication open and really mourn this as well. \n\nAlright enough rambling, even though I don\u2019t know you all, I send my love to everyone reading this and know that you are amazing for going through such a crazy journey. I love your beautiful stories and really it helps so many of us going through this silent pain. If this read helps anyone please let me know. I\u2019m processing this pain now and would love your support.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 17095, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Reality Check good/bad/sad/the ugly", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/fhmhg6/reality_check_goodbadsadthe_ugly/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "laurenash71", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4z9bc5vt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1584055789, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/fhpx34/i_am_3_days_late/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fhpx34", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/fhpx34/i_am_3_days_late/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1584055795, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m 3 days late for period, and going crazy because I just want it to come.

After the transfer failure (and before this retrieval cycle), we did some testing: ERA (receptive), hysteroscopy (normal but endometritis in the biopsy, did a course of doxy), prolactin (high, on cabergoline, retest in 2 weeks). After all of this, of course we\u2019re eager to try again, but I\u2019m wondering if we should take a cycle off and do the Receptiva as part of a natural cycle. I have no symptoms of endometriosis and my RE doesn\u2019t seem thrilled about testing for it, but said she would. I am terrified of having another thing to deal with / barrier, and the treatment seems very grueling, but also want to be very cautious with these embryos. Also, if cycles / transfers are going to get interrupted because of Covid anyway, maybe it\u2019s a good way to use the time. What would you do? \n\nAnother weird factor: during monitoring for this cycle, my RE can see \u201ccystic structures\u201d that appear to be under my uterine lining and said she doesn\u2019t know what to make of them, doesn\u2019t think they would interrupt implantation, but doesn\u2019t know for sure. Also that there\u2019s no other good way to look at them (can\u2019t be seen on a hystero).

When we found the out she was pregnant after our first round of IVF in September we were over the moon. Throughout this process, as many of you know, there have been many tears, tons of stress, and every other emotion that infertility treatments can evoke.\n\nA little history on our relationship, we have been together for over ten years,  married for close to 7 and trying to conceive for around 5.  We are in our mid 30. We are great partners and made decisions together and respect each other. All of which I feel very lucky to have.\n\nAs far as the pregnancy goes, she was fortunate and had a fairly easy first trimester with very little morning sickness. The second was even better she was feeling good, active in good spirits and in general happy.\n\nShe is now about to enter the 3rd trimester and she is beginning to get more uncomfortable, having difficulty sleeping and her mood is slipping. This is where I may lose some of you.... While I know she is literally growing a person, and her body has been though a ton with the hormones both from fertility treatments and the baby, but I feel like everytime I say something or do something she is mad at me. She has become very pessimistic and seems to refuse to acknowledge how lucky we are. Admittedly I made a big mistake the other day and told her that her natural shape is round....(note to self never call a pregnant woman round... I think correct response is you look beautiful)\n\nIn any case. What can I do to make it easier for her? I genuinely am trying to keep her happy and more optimistic, but she seems to see everything though sh*t colored glasses right now... I've tried to do more chores around the house, bought her a new succulent pot (which she loves) and tried to be generally more empathetic. At this point I have literally stopped responding other than a few word responses for fear of upsetting her more.\n\nThoughts?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 17120, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Pregnancy; a trial of pessimism and patience", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/fj8gas/pregnancy_a_trial_of_pessimism_and_patience/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Mitsukiisawesome", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hq8bdnt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1584317762, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/fjbk1j/cant_live_a_child_free_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fjbk1j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 25, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/fjbk1j/cant_live_a_child_free_life/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1584317766, "score": 1, "selftext": "Does anyone else have days where theyre so depressed they truly believe it will never happen?

We are always glad to see members graduate, and to welcome new users in to the fold. However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.\n\nIf you haven't already, please read our rules (https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/about/rules). If you're on mobile you can find this under \"About Community\" at the top of the page (look for the three dots in the upper right corner).\n\n**Mention of pregnancy or positive results** post treatment is only permitted in the results thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/?f=flair_name%3A%22Results%22). Vague and sensitive mentions to \"success\" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies \"I had success with A,B,C\"). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.\n\n**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses \"blessed\", \"miraculously,\" \"easily conceived\", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.\n\n**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.\n\nThis is a **science-minded, realistic, and sometimes cynical sub**. There are many communities online for people who want a more \"positive\" or \"upbeat\" experience complete with baby du$t.  People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic, and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies/cures as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).\n\nSex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. **Infertility isn't cute**, and neither are the terms we use. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.\n\n**No solicitations** will be allowed for monetary or medication donations. To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed.\n\nIf you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button. The \"report\" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment. Reports are anonymous, but selecting a reason is very helpful context. This will help us to actively moderate this community and makes it easier to catch posts or comments that break our rules.\n\nAs always, we are so proud to moderate this amazing community of strong, diverse and compassionate people.

I am also posting this as a standalone comment as it will be lengthy and I want to increase visibility. \n\nAs you can see from my flair, I am 33 and have been on my infertility journey for three long years. Prior to commencing treatment, my partner and I had two miscarriages, both ending at 8 weeks. The first was a natural miscarriage and the fetus stopped growing around 6.5 weeks. POC was not tested. Six months after the first miscarriage, I took Letrozole for 3 months, despite regular periods, and only ovulated once on the medication and the cycle was not successful. I went off medication and became pregnant a few months later, one year after the first miscarriage. The second miscarriage resulted in a D&amp;C and an emergency room doctor thought I had a molar pregnancy. The pregnancy was not molar; however, this was not determined until the POC was tested. As a result of the D&amp;C, I ended up with scarring that took a surgery to remove. At this point, my partner and I had met with our RE, but were on hold to start treatment due to the surgeries. \n\nWe completed one unsuccessful IUI with our RE but were told our odds with IUI were the same as TI so we elected to stop treatment for a few months while we saved for IVF. We completed RPL testing and all of our RE tests came back normal, with the exception of high AMH. I enquired about PCOS; however, have been told (a few times) that the only marker I have is high AMH. Due to the miscarriages, we thought our issue was chromosomal abnormalities and that IVF could resolve the issue. \n\nWe went through our IVF with ICSI cycle in April 2019. Results: 51 mature eggs, 18 eggs fertilized, 10 frozen (1 abnormal, 5 normal, 2 untested, 2 no result). Since IVF we have completed two transfers: 1 CP and another miscarriage. The latest miscarriage was difficult since it was a tested embryo and we were on track with great doubling and first ultrasound at 6 weeks. At our 7.5 week ultrasound we were told that growth stopped at 6.5 weeks (again!) and there was no heartbeat. We waited two weeks for a natural miscarriage but ended up taking medication March 1. \n\nAt this point, I do not want to complete another transfer until we can test something else or take another approach since we can't seem to make it past 6.5 weeks (PGS or not). If you have made it this far, I am wondering if there is any advice you can provide or suggested questions for my RE? \n\n- We have completed all tests except an ERA - which I did not think was needed based on our implantation. \n- I plan to enquire about transferring two embryos (one untested since I can't transfer two PGS).\n- I also plan to ask for yet another saline sono to ensure that there are no issues after this last miscarriage. \n- I have to double check if my partner has had a DNA frag test but that would not affect our transfer. \n- We are testing the POC from the last miscarriage and waiting on the results.\n- We can't afford another IVF cycle or surrogacy so the embryos we have will be the only ones we can use. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 17125, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What can we do next: a request for advice", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/fk52ab/what_can_we_do_next_a_request_for_advice/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1584464811, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/fk8ukc/tuesday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fk8ukc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Daily", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 36, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/fk8ukc/tuesday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1584464880, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!

I honestly found out in the best way possible. I\u2019d asked my doctor not to call me with beta results on Thursday unless they were positive, then I got my period (two days late) on Saturday. I didn\u2019t get a call from them, and I never tested at home, I\u2019d already accepted this cycle as a failure. At our WTF appointment yesterday to discuss next steps, the doctor asked if I\u2019d gotten my period yet, then let us know that we\u2019d had a chemical pregnancy. I was initially so happy to know that sperm and egg had met &amp; combined and at least made it to implantation to start producing a tiny bit of hcg, which is way further than we\u2019d ever gotten before. We finally knew that our sperm and egg could do something together &amp; I felt like this was just a piece of data meant that when we did IVF with ICSI / PGT next month, we\u2019d have a decent shot.\n\nWe called mr. owls mom, just to keep her updated. We told her we had a few mixed emotions, but ultimately it was a good thing &amp; we were viewing it as a positive piece of data. We chatted for a bit, talked about how we might have to reschedule due to COVID-19, but so far are still on the schedule for end of April. She advised us to hold off until this was all over, and I half heartedly agreed.. I know that it\u2019s coming. Then she brought up that my SIL (mr. owls sister) and her husband will be trying again. RIGHT AFTER telling us to wait on treatment because of everything going on. What?! \n\nSIL will be trying for #3, and her two living children were both conceived cycle 1. SIL has not made any effort to try to empathize with us at all in the last two years, so I\u2019m already bitter about pretty much everything related to her and her family. But when I brought it up that MIL had just advised us to wait but was ok with them trying, she was basically like \u201cwell you know how easy it is for them and I wanted to give you a heads up because they\u2019re probably already pregnant. I just didn\u2019t want you to be blindsided\u201d. Ughhhh fuck me. \n\nSo today when I saw the ASRM guideline to postpone upcoming cycles I just lost it. I know it\u2019s the smart thing to do, and it\u2019s probably what we will do (even if our clinic doesn\u2019t force us to) but it\u2019s just not fucking fair my SIL isn\u2019t thinking about whether or not this is \u201cresponsible\u201d. And even if she is thinking about that, SHE still has the power to make that choice. I hate that this is one more choice that was taken away from me. And I\u2019m bitter, sad, mad, idk. \n\nAnd now that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer, it feels different to find out that we were the closest we\u2019d ever been last month. It makes it that much more infuriating because if it had just fucking worked this time, then I wouldn\u2019t be forced to wait. Again. \n\nAnd also side note, wtf is up with the fact that I was told I had a chemical pregnancy and was like \u201cyay!\u201d?! Why do I have to be so hardened and dissociated from this shit in order to protect myself? Again, the injustice - I know if SIL had been in the same situation it would have been some big to do. But here I am assuring everyone it\u2019s a good thing..\n\nAnyways, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m really going to get from this, because ultimately my SIL will become pregnant again and I\u2019m going to have to pretend to be happy for her, my IVF cycle will get cancelled, and I\u2019ll still be childless when she welcomes a THIRD baby into their tiny two bedroom apartment. No matter what I say or do I\u2019m stuck in this situation that I have no control over. I guess I just needed to vent and whine, and maybe to get a virtual hug from some strangers on the internet.
