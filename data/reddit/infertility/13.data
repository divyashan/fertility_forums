I haven't been to a dentist in a while so I expected a lot of fillings, but I guess I need to either get a root canal or an extraction of my right last upper molar.  I am leaning towards an extraction simply because I'm worried about the root canal causing more problems down the road, especially during a pregnancy.  I've also read that a root canal can never get completely rid of the infection so an extraction is best.  I don't really want to shell out the money later though for a dental implant.  My RE told me that dental work is fine before a transfer but I still worry.  I'm not in a lot of pain right now, although I know that can change in an instant with tooth problems.\n\nHas anyone been through this scenario?  What did you choose?  I feel like losing the very backmost molar shouldn't be that big of a deal, but supposedly it puts me at risk for tooth movement and eruption of the bottom tooth opposite the one removed.\n\nAlso, if anyone has any recommendations for a dentist in the South King County/North Pierce County suburbia region of WA State, I'm all ears.

Eventually it could scar my tubes and etc. I'd like to talk to my husband about \"where we stop\" on our quest to have a child, but I am afraid I'm not exactly sure what the path IS.\n\nMy knowledge to this point:\n\n- try naturally for 6 months\n\n- Clomid\n\n- ???\n\n- IVF\n\nAdditional question: should I be trying to look for an RE? I will be looking for a new OBGYN in any case, just because I am going to switch to my husband's clinic once the insurance for my new job kicks in, in November. I am worried that a new OBGYN/RE won't want to follow the same plan that I've already discussed with my current doctor.\n\nAdditional, additional question: I really wanted my husband to get an SA (pre-emptively) last month, but he seemed really gun-shy about it. So I agreed to back off and worry about it more once we get to Christmastime, if I'm not pregnant. He's on the overweight side, so I think that can impact sperm-related things. When did you have to do an SA? Any tips about how to approach this whole topic?\n\nI understand everyone's situation is different, so there is a different path/different treatments for everyone. I'd like to hear about YOUR path, as well as an insight into what I may be facing in the future.\n\nThank you kindly.\n\n\nEdit: Every one of you has been so helpful and brought up many great points and things to think about. I think my plan of attack is going to be to send my husband for an SA as soon as possible, and look into getting hooked up with an RE rather than an ObGYN.

I feel as ready as I can. \n\nI warned my hubby I would be here a lot this morning. \n\nI'll update this all day as I have more thoughts. \n\nA great start since my parents brought a cheque* with them when they arrived to pick me up. Then a shit delay because my husband didn't bring his wallet and needs his health card. We've pulled a u turn and we're going to be late. This is not like him so I'm really pissed. \n\nWe don't have a car. I drive but my husband doesn't and I can't drive myself today anyway. Perks of having moved back to my home city last year. \n\n* After I started crying, I found out the cheque, an almost perfect amount to cover last year's IVF+meds (but not FETs), has nothing to do with this. It's to offset the fact that I can't join my dad and brother climbing Mt Kilimanjaro next week. Mom can't make it fair that I can't go, but she can make the finances of \"paying my brothers way and me not costing anything\" fair. It's just a coincidence that it will pay for this. I felt less beholden after that. Phew. \n\nChecked in:\n\nFeeling woozy from the lorazepam already. Here comes the damn hand IV. Ugh. Mr mL is off doing his part. I hope he's ok because usually he makes a big joke about racing others but he's not back yet.\n\nHere he is and my IV is in and my arm is freezing and the nurse just pulled on the tube to move my arm. Ugh. \n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nUpdate from Dr. mL (I'd been demoting him to not cause confusion with the medical doc's);\n\nProcedure went well, she is crying happy tears and going to take a power nap \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSo I'm more conscious now. That retrieval went so much easier. I don't know which of all the confounding factors helped : more fentanyl, the music, just knowing that to expect. But there was no panic. \n\nEgg haul: 9. Tears are no longer happy. I have to stop trying to interpret my chart  since I was really sure we were getting 18. Based on last time's chart and outcome. \n That was just a blow of \"fucking  amateur counting eggs before they're retrieved.\"\n\nBut then in response to my upset the nurse said, \"what, did you want 9 kids\" and I immediately threw back \"that's not how that works. Grow out here is about 40%\" But I hate trying to reason with them in the recovery room; they all look at me like they want to pat me on my head and say \"don't think so much\". (Oh and they did say that.) \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBeing driven home now. I've had nothing to eat because I don\"t want to but very little to drink on nurses orders which are annoying me because cold water or hot tea should settle my stomach. She said I should at least wait until after the drive. I have two different kinds of throw up bags.  \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHaven't ralphed yet. Mom and hubby ran into Costco for me for a couple things (it's right on the way home so I insisted). I grilled my dad about his prep for Kilimanjaro - did they have all the embassy number, the rescue helicopter on speed dial, was the guide trained to tell if dad (or my brother) had to stop. It sounds like they are totally prepared -- the guides have 02 sat monitors to make sure the altitude isn't getting to them. \n\nI'm set up on the couch with everything I could need and the intercom to bring Mr. mL down if necessary. But right now, nap time. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWow what a great nap!!\n\nThanks for all the great messages everyone. It meant the world to me to have you there with me through it. I had to explain to my hubby last night that I was going to be on my phone all day and he thought I meant at home. Hahahahaha nope even if it meant trying to single-hand type with my non-dominant hand because of the IV in my other hand.

I know a couple who had to do 5 IVFs and the last round, they transferred 5 embryos and only one of them stuck; she had to get her cervix sewed shut to keep the embryo in!!!!\" (awesome, thanks for bringing up what I'm already obsessively worrying about)\n\n-\"Ah, you've never been pregnant?  Have you thought about a surrogate?\" (Um yeah, except we don't have the spare $100k to pay for one, but thanks for asking)\n\n-\"Are you going to transfer more than one?  Don't they ALWAYS transfer more than one?  What are you going to do if you have twins?  You'll have you quit your job if you have twins, there's just no way you can work with twins.\" (Yeah, I can't really afford to quit my job, but thanks for the concern, I guess?)\n\n-\"Pregnancy makes your skin awful, your hair fall out, and your teeth deteriorate.  Maybe all of those won't happen to you, but trust me, at least two of those will.\" (I'm already worried enough about my hair due to the PCOS; did NOT need to hear this!!!!)  \n\n-\"What are you going to do with the leftover embryos?  They're babies, you know that, right?  They may just be a clump of cells but they're still your babies.\" (Yup, already worried about this, too, thanks for asking)\n\n-(after being told that embryo adoption is an option):  \"Well yeah, but then someone else would be parenting YOUR babies.\" (Yup, already thought about this, didn't need to be reminded of that angle)\n\n-\"I don't really understand donor eggs.  Why not just adopt?\"  (I'm not even doing donor eggs, and don't worry guys, I educated her on adoption and why ppl opt for donor eggs).\n\nSo at this point I'm sure you all are wondering why I didn't say a few choice words and walk away from New Dentist, never to return.  Trust me, I've thought about it.  But she really did seem to mean well....it's hard to explain.  She's just one of those ppl that doesn't know when to STFU. Plus, although she clearly knows fuck-all about IVF, she does know her shit about dentistry. Also at this late in the game, I really don't have time to try and find yet another dentist before my FET.  My dental insurance has a pretty narrow network and New Dentist's office is one of the only ones that is a \"preferred provider\" in my town.\n\nMy plan going forward is to instead try to see New Dentist #2 exclusively; I saw him yesterday and he came across as extremely competent, gentle, and most importantly, didn't say ignorant shit about IVF.  In fact, he didn't mention it at all; instead, he was fully focused on my comfort and care and I had probably the best dental experience I've ever had.  \n\nMy encounter with New Dentist really shook my confidence in this whole process though.  :(  Obviously she doesn't know WTF she is talking about, but still....ugh.

Ultrasound tech doesn't turn the monitor where I can see, doesn't say a word about what she sees and when I ask \"So, any cysts?\" she's all \"The doctor will tell you.\" Girl, by now I can read that thing better than you can.\n\nTalk to my RE. AFC is 5-6. Plan is clomid if my FSH isn't stupid-high. RE emails me a few hours later \"Hey, I think you have a functional cyst, FSH 22 and E2 is 665.\"\n\nFor those of you new to my special snowflake ovaries, the last time I had a 'cyst' on Day 3, I insisted on trying to see if there was an egg in there, and so I triggered that day, and on Day 5, boom, egg. Slightly immature but it matured in the lab and fertilized.\n\nMe: What size is it? \n\nRE: 2.1.  Do you want to trigger see if there's anything to retrieve like we did last time?\n\nMe: Yes. Set it up and I'm on my way.\n\nI decide to walk to the clinic because I've been sitting on my fluffy ass too much, and while I'm en route, RE calls. Apparently my LH is really high. The thing is, they can't tell if it's a surge or not because apparently my LH is varies cycle to cycle and is frequently high (which is what happened the time I ovulated through the ganerilex, they saw the LH was high but assumed it was just me being high LH. Not so.) \n\nSo it's possible that if we trigger today and retrieve Sunday, we will be retrieving too late, because who knows when the surge started? \"What if we retrieve tomorrow?\" Still might be too late, but also it might be too early and the egg is immature.  \n\nRE: What do you want to do?\n\nMe: Uhh....  I'm walking over. Let me think while I walk and if you have a second between patients let's talk when I get there.\n\n(RE's recommendation was \"I don't live your reality, but I would recommend skipping this cycle.\" No. I do not have normal cycles to wait for.)\n\nSo I get there with the idea of hey, what if I took the trigger shot right now (like, 2 in the afternoon) to give little whoever in there the best possible shot of maturing and then we retrieve tomorrow if there is anything to retrieve?\n\nRE: It's unconventional, but we can try it. But you know, it may already be too late, and it may not work, so as long as you can emotionally handle the worst case scenario....\n\nMe: What worst case scenario haven't I been through already?\n\nSo I triggered right then and there and egg retrieval is tomorrow. On Day 4. We have to freeze, because it's motherfucking CD3 and I am still bleeding last cycle's lining away.\n\nMy nurse (who actually administered the trigger since I was there) was like \"Your RE came to me and said 'Don't judge me, but I have a strange situation with a patient.' and I was like 'Oh, I bet I know who it is.'\" I truly am a special snowflake.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Special snowflake ovaries strike again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3n9e4h/special_snowflake_ovaries_strike_again/"}, {"author": "ChandlerBingsNubbin", "author_created_utc": 1437069849, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_oufoj", "created_utc": 1443815940, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3n9keu/free_ivf_meds/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3n9keu", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3n9keu/free_ivf_meds/", "retrieved_on": 1450757052, "score": 16, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I have 1 10 mL vial of Progesterone in oil, unopened.

Or did she tell me she would and then given me the answer she thought?  Seriously, every time I ask Debbie for something she says she asked and the answer is no.  Can I do a RLP? No. Would a hysteroscopy be a good idea?  No.  Can I have migraine meds called in?  No.  RE: yes, yes, yes.  \n\nThis is why I try to ask Debbie as little as possible and go to the RE directly.  I think Debbie is getting irritated with me about it but this is ever so slightly more important than her feels.  \n\nIt's too bad, I like my RE.  He's a little conservative on med dosages in my opinion but other than that, I like him.

I can't believe I'm here. I'm sure that's a common sentiment. This is so long, I'm sorry, but there's a TL;DR at the end.\n\nWe got pregnant on our second try in July. That ended in miscarriage.\n\nI bled for weeks after the MC. Ultrasound and MRI were inconclusive as to whether I had an intracavitary fibroid, or just retained products of conception. I was scheduled for a hysteroscopic procedure (either D&amp;C or myomectomy) to have whatever-it-was out in August.\n\nThey found secret option C: a mass that wasn't a fibroid. They removed a bunch of it, and the pathology came back as low-grade endometrial stromal tumor. It is usually malignant, but the tumor needs to be cut out with healthy tissue in order to know for sure.\n\nMy oncologist agreed to try still-experimental fertility-preserving treatment. This involved taking out the remaining tumor along with the piece of uterus it's attached to and a small margin around the whole thing, then reconstructing my uterus. Even with a malignant tumor, this should allow me one or two pregnancies, with constant monitoring and eventual hysterectomy.\n\nTwo weeks ago they resected the tumor. Pathology came back as malignant low-grade endometrial sarcoma. I was prepared for that. Worse, the margin was positive, meaning there are probably still tumor cells in my uterus. A repeat resection is useless: the remaining tumor is microscopic, and even if they knew what tissue to take out, it would likely leave my uterus unable to carry another pregnancy.\n\nSo I'm having a hysterectomy as soon as 1) I recover sufficiently; and 2) I have one round of IVF to freeze some embryos. I won't lose my ovaries in this procedure, but the risk of damage is enough that we want to try to get some embryos before the hysterectomy. That puts us in early to mid November.\n\nI met with the RE, and we have a timeline for egg retrieval in four weeks. The protocol will be modified to accommodate the hormonal responsiveness of my cancer. It's our last hope, but I'm not getting too excited.\n\nThere is just so much.\n\nI entertained wild schemes of getting pregnant anyway and giving the finger to the massively increased risk to my own life. My husband doesn't want that. I would do anything for him, I would die for him, but he wants more: he wants me to live. So I am committed to a hysterectomy...but they'll still have to strap me down and sedate me when the surgery comes around.\n\nA gestational surrogate is our only hope for having biological children. We definitely can't afford one yet.\n\nI can't be hopeful anymore until I have an actual baby in my arms. At every appointment, we have been hopeful, made a plan, only to crash and burn. Not only do our plans not work, the result is *worse than we ever imagined*.\n\nAt this rate, we'll get zero embryos out of my 20 potential follicles. Or our eventual gestational carrier AND our baby will die in childbirth. Or I'll be the only person in history to die of my cancer within a year of my diagnosis. The one, one, one thing we have going for us is that the cancer is very non-lethal after hysterectomy.\n\nTLDR: Hysterectomy due to cancer.

This is my first post here. I've found myself visiting this sub more and more the past few months, so I figured I might as well introduce myself so I feel less awkward about jumping into conversations. \n\nI'm DJ, but a lot of folks on reddit just call me by my username or effy. I'm engaged to a wonderful man, and we've been trying to do this baby-making thing since May of last year. It hasn't gone well. I have what my doctor is referring to as \"mild\" PCOS. My cycles were 70-80 days long and unpredictable until recently. Starting Metformin has put my cycles back on track (35-40 days) and I'm hoping this makes a difference. I've had one confirmed pregnancy in the past (about 5 years ago) which ended in a termination against my wishes. (I won't go into details here because I don't want to traumatize anyone, but if you're curious, I don't mind sharing.) I am disabled and stay at home. I suppose that's not relevant, but it'd be wonderful if I could find more folks who are disabled and also stuck in this miserable process. \n\nMy fiance is an amazing man, who also happens to be transgender, meaning that he doesn't produce the genetic material needed for us to have a child naturally. We have been using donor sperm. When we ran out of money, we switched to a known donor. Recently, we've switched to two new donors (both known) and we are inseminating at home with both of their sperm samples, at least twice a month each, for the past two cycles. I get a lot of raised eyebrows when I bring that up, but honestly, I don't care anymore. I am doing everything and anything I can possibly think of to increase our chances. More sperm = higher chances, right? Theoretically? Ha. \n\nWe just recently were able to get our finances back in order enough to enroll for health insurance again, which will hopefully put us in a better position. I do have a provider lined up who is willing to help me keep my doctor's appointments as low-cost as possible (provider happens to be the partner of my therapist, which works out fantastically for me) but I'm just playing a waiting game for insurance to get itself straightened out until then. \n\nRight now I'm spotting because apparently my body has decided my plans and dreams don't matter and it's just gonna send my period 2 days early. No big deal. Screw you too, uterus. Anyway, that's my story. I'm glad to have found a community that doesn't push false positivity on those of us who are struggling. I love the people over at /r/TryingForABaby but the constant stream of \"fingers crossed!\" and \"keep your chin up!\" and \"you're not out til your period!\" can get really, really irritating when all I want to do is just allow myself to be rightfully fuckin' miserable. \n\nSo, yeah. Hi folks. \n\nEdit: I have to say, I didn't realize how awesome it would be to not feel like I have to watch my language in a sub. I have a bit of a potty mouth (by a bit I mean I put sailors to shame, no big deal) and not feeling like someone's going to ask me to watch my language every time I say 'fuck' is SO NICE.

I have PCOS and have been TTC for almost a year and a half. This summer while on a family trip, my grandmother (who I'm really close to) went on a tirade about how she doesn't believe in fertility treatments (must be nice when you had 4 kids) and that it's playing God and she doesn't think people should mess with that. I argued my side and informed her that was very hurtful to someone like myself because I would do anything to have a kid and people like my cousin (I'll call her Jane) just pop them out and don't even want them. My grandma of course defended poor Jane's children and lamented how though Jane doesn't take care of them, they are very loved. That had absolutely nothing to do with my point of myself being deemed unworthy by her god, but oh well.\n\n A little side story about Jane. She has 2 kids that she sees twice a week by choice, because she doesn't really like taking care of them, except when it's convenient for her. For the first year of one of the children's lives, my grandma would drive down every week to help take care of the child because Jane wanted to party! Flash forward to today, Jane has a pregnancy announcement on Facebook, yay Jane. Ruined my day and of course made me spiteful that life can be so cruel. I dread Thanksgiving coming up because Jane will be there all pregnant and everyone will just fawn over her like she's mother of the year. She even had the audacity to comment on her post \"you know I didn't even want anymore kids\" Just needed somewhere to vent since I don't see my therapist for another month.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Infertility Rant", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3nf0vm/infertility_rant/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1443952991, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3nfsyh/sunday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3nfsyh", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 43, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3nfsyh/sunday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1450754071, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

I work as a medical assistant in a NICU and he is an Active Duty Army officer. We have two dogs and I like to crochet little hats for the NICU babies in my free time. Working on pumpkin ones right now for Halloween.\n\nI went off my birth control pills after ten years of use in March. Had a 90 day cycle, went to the doc and was diagnosed with PCOS and annovulation. Spent the summer doing baseline bloodwork, rebooting cycles with Provera, and taking increasing doses of Metformin with no results. Upon getting back CD 21 bloodwork with a progesterone level of 0.8, my PCM is sending us to the infertility clinic. He's ordered a semen analysis and HSG, and if we are still waiting for an appointment with the RE after all those results are back, he can do one round of Clomid with us.\n\nI feel very lost, broken, sad, and alone right now. I know few people at our current duty station and \"hey I found out I have fertility problems\" doesn't make for a good text to friends several time zones away. So I don't talk about it much. Some friends know we are trying, but they're all \"it will happen when it happens!\" I know my husband very much does not want to do the semen analysis - he wants having children to be a \"fun surprise\" that we get one day after having lots of sex. I suppose that's our first hurdle to cross.\n\nThe second is that we are scheduled to move in mid-February, and will only be there for six months, so depending on how long the wait is for the RE we could be looking at quite a while before we can get going on any sort of plan.\n\nI know these are common feelings and is probably a pretty common story around these parts. I take some comfort from that. I will probably not post much, but I will read a lot because you all have gone through more than I can even imagine and show such strength.

Then I apparently developed a pituitary tumor that produced growth hormone and which remained diagnosed for years while doctors told me that I had unexplained infertility and PCOS (I don't. I didn't.)  Finally, my slight increase in prolactin and annoying attitude got me a referral to the endocrinologist, which revealed a 2 cm tumor.  It was less than ideal to find this out.  Growth hormone causes acromegaly.  Sort of like Andre the Giant, except my tumor was caught early enough that I still look like me, sort of. \n\nI am now 6 months post surgery, my cycles have returned to semi-normal 25-30 days....but I still can't get pregnant.  I had a chemical pregnancy last month, which failed. Unknown why, except my pituitary is probably still deviated or damaged in some way.  My luteal phase is an underwhelming 9 days (before the surgery it was an impressive 3-4 days).  I found out today my AMH, at 1.5, is too low for my age (I'm 33).  \n\nGiven all of the above, my RE told me that her office will now be my pituitary.  I am starting a medicated cycle as soon as my cycle begins anew, which should be in 4 days or so. 2 weeks on BC, then femara, then ovidrel...then seeing what happens.

She told me : I'm pregnant, I don't have to move for anyone.\n\nGosh, i'm happy I only tell her : OI, I need my shoes, MOVE. Freacking smug bitch. \n\n\nSo........ Yeah, gonna go have a glass of wine, or just put a straw in the bottle.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So, you go to yoga to relax, right?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3nwf1r/so_you_go_to_yoga_to_relax_right/"}, {"author": "NotThatKindofShot", "author_created_utc": 1436888901, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_osl5z", "created_utc": 1444261676, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3nwn3u/quick_question_about_periods_after_retrieval/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3nwn3u", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3nwn3u/quick_question_about_periods_after_retrieval/", "retrieved_on": 1450746076, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI'm mostly a lurker, but I have a little bit of a situation that Dr Google turns up zilch on, so I was wondering if you guys could offer me any insight. I had my egg retrieval for IVF #1 back in August. I am SUPER regular with my cycles (like start-on-the-hour every 28 days regular), and like clockwork I got my first post-retrieval period 2 weeks after surgery (it was a freeze all). Now eagerly awaiting my period so that I can finally start an FET cycle, and my period won't start. 10 days late tonight. I'm beyond frustrated, but used to my troll body by now. My nurse says I just need to wait- \"these things happen post retrieval\"- or come in for a sono to check it out. Any ideas of what exactly causes this? How long I should wait before going in? My nurse is not exactly a great source of information, and I'm ready to get this FET moving before I lose my mind even more.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "quick question about periods after retrieval", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3nwn3u/quick_question_about_periods_after_retrieval/"}, {"author": "fab93", "author_created_utc": 1430224184, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "29 MFI (using donor sperm now) Low AMH/DOR Moving on to IVF #4", "author_fullname": "t2_n684a", "created_utc": 1444263555, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3nwr84/i_love_you_guys_but_im_tired_of_being_in_this_sub/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3nwr84", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3nwr84/i_love_you_guys_but_im_tired_of_being_in_this_sub/", "retrieved_on": 1450746022, "score": 28, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I want to \"graduate\" and move on to all the baby sub reddits so bad.

I\u2019ve been reading this sub for a while now, not sure I belonged here, in the back of my mind I kept thinking if we tried harder, charted better, or took some magic pill it would just happen. I am 28 and my husband is 31, day 3 blood work and SAs came back normal. We finally met with an RE (RSC in San Ramon) after 19 months of trying, 4 clomid iuis, and never seeing a positive test. He ordered genetic testing, more blood work, and an HSG, which all came back normal. So we decided to move on to IVF, there is still that tiny voice in the back of my mind saying you just need to keep trying, but after so many months of heartbreak on CD1 and watching friends start trying and have their babies, I just needed better odds, I need something that will work, and most of all I need hope! \n\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed reading this sub, it was so interesting and helpful to hear about all of your experiences and I love the support you give each other. You ladies are so brave and strong, it gives me courage. This journey has been so frustrating and isolating, we haven\u2019t told many people but reading your posts I feel like I have a friend. \n\nTLDR: Diagnosed unexplained, starting IVF, terrified", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3nwt9v/intro/"}]}
