FET #2 was initially a success. Pregnancy was progressing relatively well before everything came crashing down 2 weeks ago at my 13 week NT scan.\n\nWe had decided to do genetic screening because our embryos were never PGS tested. At the ultrasound our little guy waved hello to us and resisted attempts by the tech to get him to roll over. My husband thought it was adorable because it reminded him of me when he tries to get me up in the morning. When they focused the scan on the heart my husband noticed something off: a bright white spot in the middle of the heart. He asked the tech what it was and she mumbled something about a reflection. OK... After that she measure the nuchal translucency (NT) and it measured normal so we breathed a sigh of relief because everything looked fine.\n\nWhen the scan was done the genetic counselor came in and gave us the first of the bad news: our baby had a 1:59 chance of having trisomy 21 (aka Down syndrome). OK. That was a little worrisome but it was still only a 2% risk so we went with her to discuss additional testing. She suggested a more thorough blood test (NIPT) or invasive testing (CVS or amino). We opted for the blood test because there was an increased chance of miscarriage with the CVS and amino and I fucking hate huge needles. We figured that with only one blood result being abnormal and everything measuring ok on the ultrasound that there was a very good chance that this was just a false positive. The genetic counselor then sent us back to the waiting room while see finished up the paperwork for the NIPT testing. While we were sitting there surrounded by other happily pregnant couples the doctor came in and asked us to come back to the ultrasound room. There was something she wanted to check on. Okayyyyyy.... We followed her back and she scanned me again, looking closely at the heart and listening to the heartbeat. When she was done she told us the bad news. Our baby sounded like he had a leaky heart valve and she suspected an endocardial cushion defect. Not only that but that kind of defect is closely associated with Downs. So our formerly 2% chance just went to something like 90% in a span of 5 minutes. She told us she was sorry and recommended me do a CVS to confirm the diagnosis and that the prognosis is not good for a baby with both Downs and heart defect. We were then sent, stunned, back to the waiting room, once again surrounded by happy pregnant couples, to wait for the genetic counselor. When we saw her again her whole demeanour had changed. Instead of the cheerful look she had earlier, she now sported a look of sadness and pity. She explained that the NIPT was off the table and that our only options were cvs or amino. We asked her if the doctor was wrong and it was only a heart defect then what were our baby's chances. The genetic counselor said that if it was just the heart defect, the baby would require open heart surgery soon after birth. If it was both Downs and heart defect then they would advise not continuing the pregnancy because the complications of both would be too much.\n\nI spent the next few days before the cvs scouring the internet for all I could find about congenital heart defects and Downs. It was not pretty. We were pretty much looking at multiple surgeries and hospital stays within the first few years of life and to top it off, people with Downs are not allowed on the heart transplant list. In short, the baby's quality of life would not be good. We decided then that if the results came back positive for trisomy 21 then we would TFMR. If it was negative, we would wait for the fetal echocardiogram at 20 weeks and hope that the heart defect wasn't as bad as the doctor thought it was before deciding to TFMR or not.\n\nI'll spare you all the details about the CVS other than to say it did hurt but nowhere near as bad as a HSG and it was a fucking huge needle (according to my husband. I was too scared to look). We got the results on Monday and it was positive for trisomy 21. We were and still are devastated. \n\nSo here I am. Termination was today so I'm in pain and emotional right now. I'm devastated I had to terminate a very much wanted pregnancy and have to go through the entire infertility process again. I'm pissed that I have to deal with people judging me for TFMR on top of all the shit I already get for infertility. Most of all, I'm pissed at the universe for making me think that things were finally looking up only to take EVERYTHING from me. And when I mean EVERYTHING, I'm not just talking about this pregnancy. I've been unemployed for over a year now and right after my transfer, I got a call from a company wanting to do an interview. The catch? The interview was the day before my beta. This is a company I desperately wanted to work for so I spent my tww studying and preparing for the interview. I figured if I could nail the interview and got the job, then it wouldn't hurt so much when I got my negative beta. I rocked the interview and got my positive beta. Whoo! Then on my birthday the district manager calls me and gives me a verbal job offer. BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER! We had a start date set up and everything. All I needed was the official offer and I could get my work visa (Canadian living in the US working in a desired field. Very easy for me to get a visa). Except the official offer never came. Apparently HR had issues with me needing a work visa. My start date came and passed with not so much of another peep from them. Eventually I accepted that the job was not happening and took solace that at least I was pregnant. Now I don't even have that.

I made a new account so I could speak freely because this is all so new and probably very personal. \n\nI\u00b4m 36 and have just been diagnosed with ovary insufficiency. I met my husband in my early thirties. We have a 2.5 year old daughter, everything was super easy the first time. Then we tried again once my cycle started again (after nursing my daughter) and it wouldn\u00b4t work. I had regular cycles and tracked my ovulation with those LH-sticks. After 9 months, I became pregnant but lost the baby in the first trimester. After that no cycles for 3 months, according to my gyno due to a ovarian cyst. Then again a few regular cycles and then just nothing since August. So on my insistence my gyno finally referred me to the hospital for a fertility check up. \n\nThe doctor there was not a fan of me. She mocked the fact that I had been tracking my cycle (Ah you\u00b4re one of those over-controlling women) and she thought the fertility check-up was completely unnecessary since I had just been pregnant in february. The missed period was again because of a ovarian cyst. \n\nThey induced a cycle with a gestagen and on the third day I had to come in and they took some hormones and counted my ovarian follicles. And in that ten-minute appointment, everything changed. While I was still on the gyno-chair, as soon as the ultrasound was finished the unempathic doctor told me that it was bad and that I would never be able to have a child again. She said, there was absolutely nothing they could do. No way to stimulate my ovaries, IVF is -according to her- out of the question. She predicted, I would never have a normal cycle again and would be spiraling into early menopause now. \n\nApparently, instead of 8 follicles per ovary I only had 1-2, the anti-m\u00fcller-hormone is 0.7 and the FSH very high. This is bad. Everything I\u00b4ve read also suggests that its really really bad. But on many sites I\u00b4ve read, there\u00b4s also talk of hope and possibilities. \n\nWe\u00b4re absolutely destroyed. I\u00b4m 36. I was just pregnant a few months ago. I still had a normal cycle this summer (at least a few rounds). We always wanted a big family, a house full of laughter and a table full of children who tell stories. I can\u00b4t imagine life any other way. I loved being pregnant and the only way I dealt with my child growing so fast was the hope that we would soon have another baby. \n\nWe\u00b4ve already called a fertility clinic and will get a second opinion there. But it\u00b4s going to be a while until then. And I can hardly function. \nCan anyone here share their experiences with ovarial insufficiency? Has anyone here had or seen similarly bad results and has still started treatment? How did it go? What did you do? Anyone know of any successstories?\n\nI\u00b4m really lost and my heart is completely breaking. I have no experience in this all.

I finally put my foot down this year and demanded further testing.  This resulted in two laps (March and August) to diagnose and treat stage 4 endometriosis.

My husband's SA results were all normal, which I guess is something positive in all of this.  My AMH was great and my hormone levels were good.

A little background here: Mid September we found out we were pregnant and we're very excited booked the usual doctors appointments and such. Then October we went into ER as I was having some bad cramping and unusual bleeding and I found out I was having my second ectopic pregnancy literally five years to the day from my first. First one was too far along to use methotrexate, and  ended up having to have a laparoscopic salpingectomy remove the pregnancy and what I found out later was a ruptured right Fallopian tube. My follow-up doctor did a very poor job and didn't tell me some of the details that would be important to conceiving later on. Some of these details I found out from the doctor I saw in ER A couple weeks ago that administered The methotrexate for my second ectopic pregnancy. She informed me that the first doctor had noted on my file that while in surgery he noticed some scarring and tissue around my left fallopian tube and my uterus. Left it at that and did not tell me so I could start looking into see if I had endometriosis or another condition. \n\nWhen I went for the ultrasound that diagnosed this ectopic, they noted I had some unusual cysts around my uterus and some pretty severe scarring on the right side where my fallopian tube was removed and along the top of my uterus both inside and on top. they noted that I had two sacs implanting in my left fallopian tube and two anomalies in my uterus that the doctor said she figured look like a cluster of cysts.  After my hCG hits zero we are going to schedule another ultrasound and make sure all of these anomalies have been taken care of. \n\nMiddle of last week I was given a second dose of methotrexate for persistent Ectopic as my hCG levels had started to plateau two weeks after first dose. My hCG had had only dropped from 130 to 110 in one week. I really can't wait to hear from my doctor when my hCG is back to zero so we can start looking at our options to try again.

I told my doctor that I'd really like to take a more aggressive approach with meds and see if I can get closer to 20 eggs, to which she responded that I'm her only patient asking for that, which seemed really surprising to me.  She said that that was okay though and we would proceed with that goal, as long as I was safe.  I've been on Menopur (75) and Follistim (125).  Today is day 5 for me and when I went to my monitoring appointment this morning, I was told that I had 11 follicles.  I'm pretty sure that's not a bad number, but especially because PCOSers tend to have more eggs retrieved in IVF, I was really hoping I'd get at least 15.  I'm just worried I might not get any to transfer or if I do that the number will be so low that I won't have enough to freeze for a second try.  I've just never gotten to see a positive pregnancy test and I'm really pessimistic about IVF working, but I at least thought I could get more follicles.  Is her more conservative approach with meds totally rational and I'm just being an annoying patient or should they have started me off on a slightly higher dose?

The teacher normally lets the kids out in groups ie brown hair, eye colour etc however this time she let them go by saying if you have a younger brother you can go, followed by little sis, big bro/sis etc and you guessed it my son was the only child left behind and she said if you are a LONELY child not only child you can go, this really upset me..\n\nThen this morning my best friend told me she is pregnant she has a 13 month old and 11yr old, to make matters worse were the comments she made when she could obviously see I was holding back tears. She said stupid things like whining about how sick she will be at Xmas and she hates being pregnant and \" I've always wanted to have my children before I'm 30 and now I am (shes29) and when I said well aren't you lucky she said well you know you probably could have too if you tried harder, and if I gave my hubby some vitamins like her hubby has had because his sperm count used to be apparently 2million yet she concieved this baby in 3months since re started period after breastfeeding. So ladies/ gentlemen the answer for us all is vitamins! She can shove them up her arse. \nGah I need a drink or 10", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do you cope with days like this?

(She was nice enough to re-count the images from today and my last appointment )\n\nMy biggest rush was my insurance coverage is maxed out till the end of the year, and my clinic is closed by Dec. 15th. My insurance will only cover one round of retrieval ($10k max lifetime).\n\n-Has anyone experienced anything similar?\n\n-Is this drop due to stress, birth control or something else?\n\n-Would you continue with your harvest if your numbers dropped like this? \n\nI feel totally alone in this. I am single. I have no partner, and I am currently unemployed. I want to make the best decision possible. I have $3500 worth of drugs in my fridge, and I am scared that I am pushing myself for subpar results. I would appreciate any feedback. This has been difficult for me, as my family is not encouraging my decision to freeze my eggs.

Instead he recommended we move on to a 3rd IUI right away and if this fails, move to IVF. Both IUI 1 and 2 were only monitored through blood test, so we have no indication of any other possible egg or lining issues. Even still, he did not recommend any change in our protocol/monitoring or waiting to see if my partner\u2019s motility would be impacted by lifestyle changes. It feels like we are on the 3 IUI to IVF train which so many people in this forum are (or were) on. It is extremely discouraging to do the same thing again and again while maintaining the expectation of a different outcome. I feel like we may need a second opinion.   \n\nThis new information has impacted how my partner and I navigate infertility. Prior to this it seemed that my irregular (although mostly ovulatory) cycles were the issue. Now it looks like male factor. However, I am still unsure that this is, in fact, the diagnosis of our infertility (our RE would not say for sure). I have given my partner web links to recommended vitamins and lifestyle changes, but I do not want to pressure him. He has never once told me what I should or should not do with my body, and this is a boundary I would like to maintain. \n\nI feel a kind of numb sadness with this turn of events.

Apologies in advance for the super long post.   Allow me to start with a little backstory. My husband and I are 30 years old and have been TTC our first baby for 15 months. Around the one year mark I went to my regular ob who started some preliminary testing. Husbands SA came back normal, thyroid and genetic screen also normal. I was mid cycle at that point so no fsh was drawn, but amh came back 1.5 (on the lower side of normal range, but not \"low\" or \"abnormal\" by any of the lab references I've seen). She sent me for an HSG which also showed normal results, no blockages etc.  Anytime I've used at home OPKs I always had a positive LH surge around the appropriate time but in the absence of any glaring problems my ob suggested trying clomid just to give things a boost. I did two cycles of 50mg through my ob followed only by cycle day 21 progesterone testing. Both cycles the bloodwork showed that I had in fact ovulated.  When I still wasn't pregnant, I scheduled an appointment with an RE. Naively I hoped for more normal results and the offer to just initiate IUI if we were feeling impatient.  Vaginal ultrasound showed a normal uterus but examination of the ovaries showed only 3 follicles on each. The doctor found this concerning obviously, as did my husband and I. His explanation was that my ovaries appear to be aging faster than he would like, and that his recommendation is to prepare for medicated IUI. Given the number of follicles and lower than average AMH, he only suggests two cycles of IUI before proceeding with IVF.  In the moment I completely froze and couldn't even think of a single question to ask. Now a few days later my mind is still spinning. I can't seem to find much information online, since every time I google about too few follicles I find articles about IVF cycles that are cancelled for poor response. Nothing that pertains to having too few follicles prior to stim.  Right now my main question is what could be behind the big rush to proceed so quickly to IVF? My insurance company had prepped me to expect 4-6 cycles of IUI which would be covered. IVF, of course, is not covered at all. My husbands main question is, if all signs up until now indicate that I do in fact ovulate every month, and all you need is one egg for conception, why does it matter if I only have a few follicles?  I talked to an OB from my group shortly after the appointment, and she said it does not sound like his suggestions are premature, and that his practice is not known to suggest unnecessary treatment for the sake of making money. I never got the impression I was getting a sales pitch and in fact had a good impression of this doctor so I am inclined to believe him as well. I guess I am just struggling to understand the rationale as well as the urgency.  I plan to email the RE tomorrow to see if I can get some clarification here. In the meantime, I still feel so overwhelmed I can't even think straight. So I put it to you...what questions should I be asking? How can I best advocate for myself?  I am new around these parts but I also plan to cross post, and hopefully get some feedback so I can send this email without sounding like a maniac.

Her response was to ask me how treatment was going every week, giving unsolicited advice (she's told me to \"just relax\" too many times and doesn't listen when I tell her to stop), complaining about her kids, and then give me a positive pep talk whenever I was feeling down. The last straw was in June when I was upset that I had not ovulated yet and she yet again told me to just relax and that she looked forward to seeing my pregnant belly when she came back from summer vacation. Then she ran off before I could tell her that made me feel worse. Anyway, that FET failed and I was pissed off at having to tell her it failed again so I decided when I saw her again (we have an adult ed class together) I would tell her that I didn't want to talk about my infertility treatments with her anymore because it hurts too much. The last few months ended up being very awkward because instead of asking how my treatments were doing, she would stare at my stomach every week trying to find signs of pregnancy. As you all know, I lost my pregnancy last week so I told the teacher I needed to take time off to grieve because sitting in class listening to the other ladies talk/complain about their kids would be too much for me.  \n\nToday was the first class of the new semester and I just got a text from this friend saying that she hopes I was missing class for a \"good reason\".

By then I was DEFINITELY miscarrying, cramps, lots of blood, etc.  Luckily I hadn't passed the sac yet though, so they were able to visualize it and see that there was no yolk sac anymore, and what was left of the fetus was difficult to find and there was definitely no heartbeat.  They measured what they could and it was still sitting at 6w1d.  I'm guessing it stopped within 24 hours of that ultrasound on Monday.\n\nI was really glad that we were able to confirm it was a loss before a miscarriage, instead of a loss due to a miscarriage.

I told the doctor about my 8 failed (fresh) IVF cycles and she was baffled as to why further testing has never been done. Her exact words were \"I will not put another embryo in that uterus until we know whats going on with you\". So I'm going for my first HSG next week and then they're going to take a biopsy of my uterine lining a week after that. And they're going to do PGS with this cycle. \n\nTo be honest, these seem like tests that should have been done a long time ago so I wasn't wasting my time and money on trial and error for 8 freaking cycles. I think the problem was that I originally came into my first RE's office because of MFI and they skipped all the testing for me. I didn't even know about my super low AMH until my 3rd cycle. \n\nI just really need some answers at this point. I don't know if anyone feels like this, but I can sense that my previous doctor's office was getting sick of me. My doctor stopped trying to figure me out and told me there was nothing else we can do but keep trying the same thing over and over again. I feel like they gave up on me. And I looked at my bill.... they charge $570 per sono/blood appointment because they make you sit with the doctor afterwards. But this doctor really seemed to care. I'm really feeling hopeful now. We're also running out of money so it's nice they have a refund program there. \n\nSo I will be spending the next few months commuting into Manhattan. Let's hope it's worth it this time!

I've been casually lurking, but it's been a mental hurdle to feel like I even belong here. There's so much good info in here though I'm kicking myself for not having embraced it sooner.\n\nJust a bit of background, SO and I are 34 and first started trying over 4 years ago. I just wrote a long post on our history in another related sub so I don't want to repeat it again here.\n\nAfter reading some very informative posts in the sub, I have been exposed to this idea of the 3 IUI/IVF train. Hello, didn't know that had a name, didn't know it was a thing. Thought it was just me being weird in my head.\n\nBasically after seeing a RE and having some tests done, we were told we are unexplained. I was given a prescription for Serophene and told to phone in when I got a positive OPK and then come in for an IUI. Which we could try up to 3 times.\n\nIt seemed weird and to me like it was leaving too many things unanswered. When reading other subs it seemed like there were so many other tests or interim steps or monitoring that could be done. So instead of moving ahead with that, we continued to try on our own. Which hasn't worked out for us, so now I'm back to considering the IUI, but again, it just seems like some random roll of the die, the results of which I get to live with for the rest of my life.\n\nIn the last couple of months, I did go see an Accupuncturist who asked me why I had never had a progesterone check done at 21days/7dpo to confirm ovulation. I went to see a walk-in Dr to request the blood work, and they were also surprised it hadn't already been done since it's supposed to be a pretty basic check.\n\nSo now this has me questioning what are some other things that may have been missed.\n\nThe RE clinic we were referred to is very well regarded. This isn't something I've talked to many people with, but when I have mentioned it, it's a clinic that people have heard of and know to be a good one.\n\nI guess I'm just feeling like a statistic and I don't know exactly how to navigate this system or try to advocate for myself. How would I even find out what other tests may have been missed?

I apologize if this is long, but there are a lot of meds, side effects, and general feelings I wish to put out there, so here it goes: At the end of September I started my period, and my doctor put me on the birth control Reclipsen in anticipation of starting IVF. I was to be on that for 3 weeks, and then the real shit begins. Unfortunately, Reclipsen made me nauseous. It took me 2 weeks to realize I wasn't coming down with something and it could be this medication. By that point, I only had another 5 days until I was off it, so I didn't want to mess with the process by complaining about my bc pill side effects. I think that got me off in the wrong foot, because I haven't felt normal in my stomach or digestive track since before starting that Reclipsen in September. After that, came the 300IU of Gonal F and 2 vials of Menapur each night for a while, until the evening of 10/26/16 when I had to start my antagonist (Cetritide). The next morning I threw up. It was awful. I continued to feel generally worse after that. Additionally by this time, my ovaries are like ripe grape bunches causing me pressure and discomfort with every step, twist, and sit down. My final ultrasound revealed 15 swollen 14+mm follicles on my right ovary alone, and half again as many on the left. The night of 10/28 (or morning of 10/29) at 1am, I took my hCG trigger shot, and by 6am I was full on vomiting and not even keeping water down. I finally call my Dr at 3pm and got a prescription for zofran to hold me over until my egg retrieval procedure the next day, Sunday 10/30. When Sunday came, it didn't go smoothly. I warned them that my right ovary was in a wonky place thanks to a myomectomy laparotomy I had April 2015, and it proved to be challenging. They had to poke and prod and apply so much pressure to retrieve eggs that I needed Oxycodone to recover. So after the retrieval, I got to stop taking Gonal F and Menapur, but had to start Medrol, Doxycycline, progesterone, and now oxycodone for pain. By implantation day, I was nauseous, constipated, and still in pain on my right side. I had the Doctor check that ovary and he says it's okay, just a little swollen still. So that's where I am right now. Implantation day was today, and I have no idea how I made it here. We harvested 13 eggs that Sunday, 11 matured, 8 were fertilized, and 2 made it to blastocyst stage, one being a particular front runner. I'm trying my best to rest right now wondering if I will ever feel normal again. I would love to hear about everyone else's egg retrieval stories.

I've been posting a little here and there but haven't really introduced myself.\n\nSome background: I have Asherman's (intrauterine adhesions or scar tissue) and my husband's sperm is wack.  I had two hysteroscopic surgeries in 2015 trying to remove this fucking scar tissue.  It's \"a mild case\" just a couple of bands of adhesions.  But they are stubborn.  After the second surgery, I had a uterine balloon in me for a week to try to prevent the scars from reforming.  It was painful and traumatic.  Afterwards, I projectile vomited into a grocery bag and then threw the bag out the car window.  Sorry, mother nature!\n\nIn January I had a saline sono and was cleared to TTC.  We did 2 IUIs which were jokes (sperm is really wack) and then we goofed off all year until we finally managed to do IVF in September.  \n\nWell, we crushed IVF.  I declared myself the valedictorian of IVF (My RE refuses to refer to me with this title.  Why?!)   23 eggs retrieved.  All mature.  100% fertilization rate with ICSI.  12 blastocysts remaining on Day 5.  All grade Asomething.   The transfer resulted in a chemical and I just had a nagging feeling that my uterus is busted again.\n\nAnd I'm right!  Asherman's is back with a vengence.  It's only 1 single little band of scar tissue right at the top.  But it's enough to hinder implantation.  I have my 3rd surgery on Monday.  This will be my final surgery.  If I can't get the scar tissue to get out and stay the fuck out, I'm not doing this again.  I'm too exhausted.\n\nI cannot believe I have 20k worth of perfect embryos and literally no uterus to put them into.  \n\nSo, enough about me.  Anyone else had to deal with Asherman's?
