One is hatching. Sorry the image is rotated.](http://i.imgur.com/JmZrvst.jpg)\n\n\n\nI included a little bit about our infertility below, to give you an idea of how long we've been trying to get this far.\n\nYesterday we woke up to a dark and rainy day and had a hard time getting out of bed. When I finally did, I put in my Crinone, walked around a little, and then had some Lucky Charms (silly though it may be, it was a good excuse to have it for the first time in ages).\n\nTransfer was scheduled for 11:15, but an hour til, I didn't have to pee and I was told to come in with a full bladder. So I chugged a little over 20 oz in about 10 minutes and I left for the clinic with a full stomach instead of bladder. When we got there, though, I was really really miserable. \n\nMy husband asked the receptionist how much longer it would be (it was about 11:30 by then) and she went to go ask. She came back saying it would only be a couple more minutes. I was dying by that point and starting to sweat.\n\nWhen they finally took me back, they said \"so we hear you have to go to the bathroom, huh? Don't worry, this will be quick.\" They were really nice. They had my husband change into these weird hasmat-suit looking scrubs, a hat, and booties. I changed into a gown, the hat, and the booties. My doctor greeted me outside the operating room.\n\nMy doctor said \"so, I know you had four embryos frozen. We thawed two today and they both survived.\" I heaved a sigh of relief.\n\nThen they brought me back, had me sign a consent, and let me lay down on the same operating room table I had my egg retrieval on. \n\nThere were 5 people in the room beside my husband and me. An ultrasound tech, my doctor, the embryologist, and two nurses. \n\nThe doctor put my legs in stirrups, inserted the speculum, and took a look at my bladder on the ultrasound to make sure it wasn't too full. She said it was perfect. I then felt her cleaning my cervix, which felt like something, but not quite pain. I didn't even notice her putting the catheter in.\n\nShe said the embryologist would go get the embryos, which they would insert into the catheter, and then once inside they would hold the catheter still for a minute in case I cramped. After that minute was over, the embryologist took a look at the straw to make sure the embryos were out, and then my doctor took everything out of me. She said there was no reason to lay down for any amount of time, so I could get up and go the bathroom right away.\n\nI was nervous about getting up, because I didn't want to strain my uterus. I think they could read my mind because the ultrasound tech said, \"don't worry, you can pee, poop, fart, sneeze, cough, they won't come out.\" \n\nAfter I had the best pee of my life, I met a nurse outside the changing room where she went over instructions with us (basically, don't run a marathon). \n\nThe rest of the day we spent together. We went and got some creamy soup at this British pub in town, then I came home and had a nap. When I woke up I could hardly believe my two little embryos were inside me. \n\n\nMaybe later I will include the picture! One of the two is hatching and looks pretty healthy from the look of it, but the other one, I can't tell.\n\n\n**\"Brief\" history:**\n\n* Diagnosed with PCOS in 2009, starting trying for a baby in early 2013\n\n* Given three months of Clomid: June, July, September 2014\n\n* Went to RE in September 2014: normal day 3 blood tests, normal uterine cavity, but anovulatory (already knew this) and the HSG showed closed tubes (we are thinking about getting a second opinion but that's a story for another time.) **Told to go straight to IVF.** Oh, also, my husband has moderate male-factor as well. Lucky us.\n\n* Start stimming for IVF #1 in late December. Have my egg retrieval in January. Got 20 eggs, 12 mature, only 5 made it to blast stage, but one did not survive.\n\n* I get OHSS (which sucks). Told to do a freeze-all cycle, which I agree with, feeling as crummy as OHSS makes a lady feel. One blast frozen on day 5 after retrieval, the other three frozen on day 6. \n\n* Start FET with estrogen patches and tablets, but my lining comes back \"unorganized\", meaning non-trilaminar (three-line pattern) in my ultrasound so we are told to start over again, try again in 6-8 weeks.\n\n* Trying FET again with Lupron this time - lining comes back a little messy again, but doctor suspects we can go ahead because it's as good as my lining gets, and may just look that way because my uterus is tipped and the ultrasound might have trouble picking everything up.

Just recently discovered the joys of reddit.  I'm sure you've all acknowledged this but I am overjoyed to find a place where people discuss infertility with compassion and intelligence.  I wasn't really finding that anywhere else on the interwebs.\n\nSo here's my question / struggle.  My husband and I have been struggling to conceive for over 2 years now.  We have experienced 3 failed iuis, 4 failed ivfs, and now I'm pregnant on ivf #5.  Yay, but not really.  I'm pretty sure I've miscarried.  It has been a bizarre string of events and we both agree that the emotional roller coaster of this round has been worse that our previous failures.  I found out I was pregnant last Tuesday, St. Patty's Day, with an HCG of 42.  48 hours later my HCG was 142; then 501; then 1742.  Literally seconds after having my blood drawn for HCG #4, I run to the bathroom and am bleeding everywhere.  It was fast and furious.  I called my dr, my husband, I call out of work, I am hysterical.  My husband and I basically mourn the loss of our first ever pregnancy only to get the phone call that our HCG is 1,742.  The nurses and doctors think the bleeding was a sub chronic hematoma (still not sure what that is exactly).  Our hopes are raised again!  Like I said, the bleeding was a fast and furious and then was over.  I had no cramps.  We figured we were okay.\n\nSadly, today's blood work came back at 351.  The nurses are shocked and think Quest Diagnostics messed up and it should read 3510.  They are having Quest re-do the blood work.  I cannot get it out of my head that Monday's episode was really a miscarriage and now I have to wait until tomorrow to hear anything.  Two questions:  A)  If I was having a miscarriage two days ago, would my blood work still return such strong numbers?  B)  Is it possible for HCG to drop 1,400 points in 2 days?  That seems incredibly steep.\n\nI'm just so confused and saddened.  I suppose I just need to wait to hear tomorrow.  Maybe this was a mistake by Quest, but maybe not.\n\nHas anyone else endured such a complicated and confusing struggle?  Most of my friends get pregnant in like 5 seconds or if they have had infertility struggles, they've conceived within 1-2 rounds of ivf.  I'm feeling hopeless.  Sorry to be such a downer.

My husband and I have been trying since January 2014, and had a chemical in October, November, and just now.  The first two I had positive tests for only two days, whereas this time I have been getting positive tests (without progression) for over a week.  I don't know if I should take it as a good sign that the pregnancy held on for a little while longer this time, or if that is irrelevant.  \n\nAnyhow, I am wondering what the next step should be as I wait to hear back from my RE with the results from the second beta test (which I am sure will be less than the 8 from the first beta).  The plan had been to move to medicated IUI (femara and follistim) next cycle, but then I did end up getting pregnant this cycle so moving on to IUI seems like it might not be the best next step since the sperm did meet the egg.  Also, what is the point in shelling out $1.5k for the chance at another chemical?\n\nI am looking for some advice on what might make the most sense given my history.  Is there any point in trying the IUI?  Should I try to do Femara and TI?  Does adding medication to the process help with egg quality and/or ovulation in a way that would help prevent another chemical?  Some additional info: I am 34 and my husband is 41.  I do not have a problem ovulating on my own, and all of our tests have come back normal putting us in the unexplained category.  \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nETA:  My RE put me on progesterone after my second chemical just in case, even though my progesterone level came back at 15 when tested.  I was on progesterone at the time of this third chemical.\n\nETA2:  You guys are great!  I have been lurking for a while, but it is even more apparent when having your own issue discussed.  Thanks again.\n\nUPDATE:  Beta went from 8 to 10 so definitely not viable.  RE called and all he said was he wanted to move to medicated IUI for stronger eggs (I guess because additional eggs being ovulated means more of a chance of one of them not being shitty although he didn't really go into detail).  I was too flustered to ask him why he didn't want to do any testing or why I would want to pay $1.5k just to lose another pregnancy.  I am so frustrated and defeated right now.

The doctor told us with intercourse there is only a fraction of a slim chance we could conceive so now we have to do IUI. I feel discouraged by this news but not all hope is lost, the bigger issue is work. I am a critical care nurse and work 12 hour shifts, 7:30 am-8pm.

It was just over and underwhelming. I switched doctors, but go to the same practice (it's the only place my insurance will cover, and it's already an hour away from me.)\n\nI posted recently about whether or not an ultrasound could miss signs of ovulation... well I went back for another scan last Friday morning. The ultrasound that morning showed no dominant follicles, but a 13mm lining. The student doctor (I think she's a fellow) told me that we would either start a new cycle or take another round of clomid, and she'd talk to my RE and give me a call back later that day. She sent me for progesterone/estradiol lab work just to check. I was really upset- the stupid clomid that makes me crazy and feel totally awful didn't work... again! So imagine my surprise when the nurse called me that afternoon and said that my lab work indicates that I would be ovulating very, very soon. And maybe we missed the dominant follicle somehow, but progesterone was 1.58 and estradiol was 114, and uterine lining was 13mm. Lastly, she told me I needed to get a repeat lab done on Monday to verify all of this.\n\nSo Monday I had the lab work done, and Tuesday the lab uploaded my results to the electronic record system (so I got an email with the results, from the lab, Tuesday afternoon.) Didn't hear from RE's office... finally Thursday afternoon I called to leave a message to ask what is going on, since I don't know how to interpret the results. Now it's a half hour before they close today and I STILL have not heard back. I called a few hours ago again. I'm so frustrated.\n\nI know I'm not an IVF patient, or IUI, or otherwise spending tons of money at their clinic. But I still freaking matter, right? I want to know what the heck is going on with this cycle- since last I heard, we were basically going to end it/recharge it up with more clomid, and then I was possibly about to ovulate. A week ago. WTF is going on then?\n\nI'm just so frustrated. Also, my lab on Monday did show some change, but I don't know what it means. Progesterone was 3.79 (up from 1.58 3 days earlier) and Estradiol was 133 (up from 114.) IF I ovulated on Saturday, like I think I may have, that means it was only 2dpo bloodwork, which I know is kind of useless.\n\nAnywho... how long is the wait normally for them to get back to you?? This is a pretty large infertility clinic, so I can't imagine they're so shorthanded that they can't just call me back for a 2-minute conversation and tell me what to expect next.\n\n\nEdit: I just called again and asked to be transferred to a nurse. She was able to pull my chart and let me know that apparently I ovulated last Friday or Saturday according to the results. So I guess I'm in the 1ww now.

Assuming the bloodwork supports a diagnosis of PCOS and the SA looks good, we'll be moving straight to clomid.  Because of the smaller cysts, the doctor wants to do a medium/high dose of clomid.  He also wants to go straight to IUI.  And thinks I should start eating meat so I can eat \"Paleo.\"  This all feels like a really aggressive course of action to me.  I think he's concerned about cervical mucous getting thick, but aren't there lots of women who get pregnant on clomid without IUI?\n\nAs far as insurance, my insurance will pay for 50% of the diagnostic stuff, so that's a relief!

Also - Should I cross post this to /r/maleinfertility or do most people go on both?\n\nMy husband and I just turned 30 this past winter.  We've been together for 7 years, living together almost the whole time, and married for about 3.5 years.  We always assumed we'd have children.  Actually when we were engaged at 25 and planning to wed at 26, we thought surely we'll start trying for kids at 28.  That gives us some time to live together as a married couple first, and then change our lives forever with children.  Well, we got to 28, and talked about it, but we both looked at each other and said \"nahh....not yet\".    We really enjoyed our independence and pretty carefree lifestyle.  Then comes 29, and the same thing happened.  We just weren't ready to \"give up everything\".  We just turned 30 in December/January, and started to think that we might as well work on this soon.  We still didn't feel very ready, but all of my friends (older ones) all said they never felt ready either!  My sister (older - 33) just had a baby and we visited and it was fun handing out with her newborn....although she cried a lot.  For more context, NONE of my close friends have kids yet and all of the people we do know are slightly older.  I guess that's what happens with young professionals living in urban areas these days.  Long story short - there was no reason to have kids earlier, and we didn't feel super ready, but didn't really have a reason not to.  One of my close friends (older by 1 year) had said she was going to start trying, so I sort of thought we'd get going soonish.\n\nWell, I'm pretty serious about my career and so I started reading a book called \"The Impatient Woman's Guide To Getting Pregnant\".  Seemed to sum me up.  I knew that as soon as we were ready, we'd want to get 'er done, if you know what I mean.  One of the things the author suggested was to get a semen analysis because 1) it\u2019s cheap and 2) you can save a lot of wasted time if there is an issue.\n\nWHAT AMAZING ADVICE.  \n\nI recommended my husband do it and I think he was excited to brag about his swimmers, so he was on board.  Even though his primary physician said he really didn't need to do this if we hadn't even started trying, he still gave the referral.  WELL THANK GOODNESS, because turns out he has 0 sperm.  None.  None at all.  I didn't know that could happen, but because of great people here and over at /r/maleinfertility, and from doctor's stats, I found out that can happen pretty frequently (I work in stats and 1% is frequent enough to worry about!)  .  Honestly I don't know why the hell they don't recommend men just check this out when it\u2019s so cheap.\n\nANYWAY.  Yes, he got it retested.  It's 0.  He also got a hormone analysis which showed his FSH levels are through the roof. No, it isn't blockage and no, it can't be reverse with hormone therapy.\n\nWe are now awaiting the results of a DNA test to find out of its possible for any sperm to be found through extraction or if we're only able to use donor sperm or adoption to be parents.  I won't get pregnant without IVF.  That's scary.  They might cut open my husband\u2019s balls....that's scary.  I might not be able to have a biological child with my husband...that's devastating.\n\nI just feel I'm in a strange situation because we haven't started trying yet.  Honestly we still hadn't when this whole thing started, so I just feel stuck.  I'm honestly grateful that I didn't go through a year of getting my hopes up and having them dashed every month with red stains for proof, but it's really eerie this way too.  Now I'm not sure if I'd rather have kids through this whole mess of medical procedures or just skip the whole thing.  And I don't know how I'll decide.\n\nDid anyone else find out they were infertile before ever knowing if you were really ready for kids anyway?  I mean I always assumed I'd have them, but when the time was right, we just kept pausing.  Now I don't know what to do and we're both really upset that at least the choice may be taken away from us.  It seems to be rushing to just start IVF now because we weren't even going to start trying naturally yet!  But I think IVF is riskier for older women, right?  But am I young for IVF because we didn't try and fail for a while?  Yes I know I need to go to a doctor to answer my IVF questions, but it just seems so strange to go from not trying to infertility treatments.\n\nBefore I was blissfully indifferent to all things babies/pregnancies/kids, now everything makes my heart hurt.  On top of all that a girl that reports to me is now pregnant.  Shit sucks.  \n\nTLDR; Found out we are infertile (without medical intervention) before we were even ready to start trying.

There was no sign of the small hydrosalpinx that was seen on the HSG. The RE who did the sono (not my normal RE) said that she wouldn't worry about it because the tubes are open (so no fear of toxic fluid flowing back into the uterus?) and its small enough not to show on the sono. The RE initially told us, after the HSG, that it wasn't dilated to the point where they would worry. \n\nFast forward to today, our follow up appointment with the RE, and we did a run down of all the tests and attempts we've had so far: my levels are normal (except progesterone, which we fixed with progesterone suppositories); hubs' SAs were all good. I responded to clomid (but I can't take it anymore) and I ovulate on my own. \n\nSo, he thinks this is a tubal factor. He can't say 110%, obviously, but that's his best deductive reasoning. My left tube is definitely dilated. It seemed clear on the HSG image even to me. He said what we saw with the HSG was the accumulation of fluid and it can accumulate and drain out and so on. But it won't get better/heal. He said because that one tube is effected it is reasonable to think that my other tube is as well but it's just not showing the same dilation/inflammation reaction. He said it's likely that the cilia are damaged and egg/sperm cannot travel to meet and that's why we can't even get a hint of a pregnancy. \n\nHe said if we did move onto IVF (his recommendation) that we could have a conversation about checking out the tube laparoscopically. But he doesn't think it's necessary unless we have  2+ failed IVF cycles. He doesn't think it's dilated enough, and it's not blocked, to have implantation problems. And he doesn't want to do surgery unless we need to. \n\nOverall he gave us an 8-10% chance trying on our own and a 50% chance with IVF. \n\nWe're moving in two weeks. I'll have a month lapse in health insurance. I'll be starting a new job. Earliest we can pursue IVF is June/July. That's ok, I guess. It'll be hard with a new job though :-/ but we'll also have a second opinion before trying because we'll need a new RE/clinic. \n\nBut... His diagnosis does seem to make sense? I mean... I don't know what happened to cause this, but I don't know what else to think at this point. Thoughts? Insight? What would you all do? \n\nSorry this was so long. It helps to write it all out.

We hadn't even started trying yet, so it's a strange order of events.\n\nThroughout this whole process, one thing is quite clear.  No one knows what the hell to say to us when we share the info.  We have both only told very close friends, and they have been pretty good.  My husband's friends all told him the test must be wrong since he told after the first, which is OK I guess, but not that helpful.  He did of course get a second test, but then he had no other kind statements to fall back on.  \n\nThe worst comments have come from our loving, well-meaning, but clueless parents.  This is just a rant on how no one knows what to say, not that I blame them.  All of this is clouded in so much silence in our society, you can't really blame people for not knowing what to say.  I thought I'd just share a few and see what doosies you guys have heard.  \n\nMy sister's first child (probably only) is about 5.5 months old now.  We'll call her husband Paul.  When I told my Mom that my husband had no sperm, she said \"let's get Paul over here! He makes great babies!\"  Ugh.  Mom, no.  Luckily my husband wasn't around to hear that one!  She also said \"this is so ironic because your sister never wanted children\"  Again, nope.  Not helpful.\n\nThe worst I think is from my mother in law though.  Again, very well meaning, but she keeps thinking my husband brought this on with his \"wild college days\".  We need the DNA results, but just....no, doesn't seem to be that.  Anyway, she was asking him about if his brother should be tested.  Strangely enough, even though he's younger and not in a long term relationship, he did because he was curious once, so he knows he doesn't have an issue.  So my husband's mother said to him, \"so then you are just one of Dad's bad sperm?\"  Ugh!  What?!?!  No my husband is not a \"bad sperm\"!  I get what she's trying to say, but just again....no.

Wife suffers from PCOS, so unprotected sex for almost a decade did not result in a pregnancy.  We sought advice at a respected fertility clinic nearby (RMA NJ, Dr Drews), and it was suggested we undergo IVF treatments.  I am going to assume that those reading this know what an exhausting process it is, so I will not go into detail.  The result was 5 good eggs retrieved, and 3 of them were fertilized.  We were called to the clinic to get the news, but we were woefully unprepared for the question we faced - how many eggs do you want to inseminate?  As we waited behind the curtain to see the doctor, the nurse said something like: Just make sure you ask a lot of questions.  Dr. Drews is typically very quiet and if you don't ask about it, he won't tell you.  This made me a little uneasy in that I was not sure I knew what kinds of questions I should even be asking.  \n\nIn comes Dr. Drews, who is quiet and subtle as advertised.  He said that we should consider the risks involved with the insemination of more than one embryo.  Paraphrasing, it was something like:  the more you insert, the greater the chance of pregnancy, but with that comes a greater risk of miscarriage.  We chose to insert all 3 in order to maximize our chances.  At no point in our conversation did he share with us the national guidelines that would have discouraged someone her age inserting more than one.  We learned of these guidelines when it was all too late.\n\nSo all 3 embryos \"took\" and we learned that in 9 short months we would be the parents of triplets (MMF).  Not more than a week later, I was given an opportunity to take a job that I had wanted for a long time...only it was in Chicago.  After much deliberation, and despite subtle protests from my wife, we decided that it was best for us to sell the house and take the opportunity.\n\nWhen my wife woke up with extreme abdominal pain at 2:30 in the morning, she rushed to the toilet and told me \"something is wrong.\"  I knew from her voice that there really was, and soon I heard the sound of her water breaking.  She was only halfway to term.\n\nBecause her water had broken on baby 1, he was already deceased by the time we saw a doctor.  That was tough enough to process.  But more heartbreak and disbelief ensued when we learned that the delivery had begun, that even though they were alive and well, her body would deliver baby 2 and 3, and that there was no way for us to stop it.  Watching my wife go through the mental and physical pain of labor 3 times, to deliver a deceased fetus, followed by 2 living fetuses that would have zero chance of survival was something that I will never forget.  That feeling of helplessness will never go away.\n\nI wrote a letter to the doctor, letting him know the unfortunate outcome of our round of IVF.  I sent it via email, and without the use of a lawyer, so not shockingly, I never heard a word back.  \n\nThere we were, trying to get through this horrific experience while our families were 800 miles away.  We had no family, no friends, and no support network to help her through.  My wife is a tough individual, and I will never understand what she went through but somehow she managed to pick up the pieces.  However, we began to have our own struggles as a couple, and before either of us could even comprehend what was happening we had grown apart enough to know we had to make a change.\n\nTL;DNR: shitty fertility doctor didn't appropriately warn us of risks, but got credited with a successful IVF; wife miscarried triplets; we have now been separated for 3 yrs.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Our Story", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/30qpiu/our_story/"}, {"author": "nikipie", "author_created_utc": 1320166245, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "30, TTC#1 since 9/13, 2 MC", "author_fullname": "t2_65op8", "created_utc": 1427675104, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/30r5pd/officially_joining_yall/", "gilded": 0, "id": "30r5pd", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/30r5pd/officially_joining_yall/", "retrieved_on": 1440824990, "score": 10, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Well, it's been 18 months since we started trying and I'm finally seeing an OBGYN for infertility so I guess I'm officially part of the group.

Then, no more periods.\n\nI was started on Provera about a year ago to induce monthly periods. My doctor told me this would make my cycles regular, but that I am not ovulating on my own. Nevertheless, my husband and I have been having unprotected sex for close to two years at this point, trying by way of not trying to prevent it, I guess. \n\nWe decided we are going to begin exploring our options. We have an appointment with the gynecologist on Thursday of this week to get information on Clomid treatments and what our plan will be. I just don't know what to expect.\n\nThat's why I'm here, I guess. I'm very nervous. And honestly, very annoyed about all of it. I'm still in the \"why me\" stage of all of this, and I'm surrounded by women who got pregnant within the first month they started trying. Gag. Is it normal to be this bitter?\n\nAnyways. I'm glad you all are here. I think I can find a lot of support here.

I had one miscarriage &amp; a few chemical pregnancies before her.  When she  was about 1 year old we decided to start trying again.   \n\nAfter a few months  of just having sex using OPKs that included a couple of chemical pregnancies we went to the fertility specialist again.  This was last summer.  For a few months I   tried clomid  and had monthly ultrasounds &amp; blood test but everything was  unsuccessful -- one month I miscarried at about 7 weeks and other months I didn't get pregnant at all.  The last time taking fertility drugs was in Oct 2014.\n\nThe stress of the drugs and clinic visits was getting to us so we decided to just have sex without all that for a few months.  Then in March we decided to schedule an appointment with the fertility specialist and got one for early April.  \n\nIn the meantime I was expecting my period in March and when it didn't start I did a HPT on day 32.  I've had so many chemical pregnancies that I don't test until I'm a few days late.  Anyways that was positive but I was spotting (just brown &amp; pink, not really red) a bit that week.  I know spotting isn't unusual so I wasn't that worried but I took another HPT on day 39 which was also positive.  \n\nNow its day 41 and the spotting has turned redder more like a regular period.  I'm not optimistic but  I don't want to take another HPT right now because tomorrow is my birthday and I don't want to be sad on my birthday.   So I'm just ignoring it for now but need to unload somewhere hence this long post.  It's been 1.5 years since we started trying this time. I still have the appointment with the fertility specialist in a week or so, so we'll see what happens.\n\nThat's all.

I told her that I want us to have the best chances possible and my husband and I both agreed that while multiples wouldn't be ideal, it wouldn't be the end of the world either. She basically then went on to say that she thought that it was a horrible idea (in more or less words) because transferring one should be just fine. She keeps telling me I have \"nothing to worry about\". I feel like this type of optimism is not good when it comes to something as uncertain as IVF. I feel like if this cycle fails, it's going to be 10x more of a disappointment than if she were to help us feel like it's a 50/50 chance.

I thought I'd introduce myself.\nMy husband and I have been on a fertility roller coaster for about four years. I'm very healthy -- I run races, I eat well and I just like to be active -- but I have a non-life-threatening condition that we were told \"could\" get worse with pregnancy. Although it wouldn't affect my health, this condition would affect my quality of life if it were to get really bad, so this was a big fear for us. Luckily, some small-scale studies eventually came to our attention and calmed our fears. There's a great deal more to the story (lots of false starts with adoption and the like), but I'd rather keep this short for now. :)\n\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, we decided to go for it and try on our own. Like many of you, I thought hey, maybe it'll be easy and happen in a couple of months! But it didn't. Because I have a family history of infertility, my husband and I were really proactive about seeking the right care. We have a great doctor now, and we just did our second IUI today. Here's hoping it takes!\n\n\nI ovulate on my own, so last month, we did the IUI 50mg Clomid but without the trigger shot. This month, I had a huge follicle that didn't seem to worry my doctor (like, 25mm huge) and a 14mm, plus some smaller ones. My doctor said to take the trigger in hopes of catching the 25 or encouraging the 14 to grow and release. So here we are!\nI've got soreness and bloating.

Tuesday I woke up with the worst period cramps I've had for a *very* long time. Serious pain. And the bleeding had started up again. Heavy, too. It was like the first round of bleeding didn't even count and Tuesday was actually CD1. Cue worry and lots of WTF?s. Kept the monitoring appt (yesterday) because I figured at least doing the bloods will help work out what the fuck is going on down there and where I actually am in my cycle. The nurse decided to treat it as a baseline to get a clearer picture of all the hormone levels. I don't know what the numbers were but I've been scheduled for another blood draw on the 3rd so hopefully the awesome nurse I see then will be able to tell me what's happening.\n\nSeriously. This stuff is so hard to deal with as it is. I do NOT need my body fucking around with me like this. I couldn't even explain clearly to the nurse the situation because it was all just too hard and too much and I ended up crying in the car all the way home, crawling back into bed and sleeping for another two hours. Making it worse is the stress of knowing that if this cycle fails our RE wants to do lots of investigating on me to see if there's underlying problems, which is going to involve needles etc which despite the past 6 months, still haven't really got much easier for me to handle. I feel like this process is demanding so much of me and there's no sign of any kind of benefit coming to us in return. How much more of myself do I have to give?

I'm trying really hard to let this go but it's nagging at me so bad right now. I just need to get it off my chest and maybe get some perspective.\n\nSo, I don't have very many friends where I live. My husband is in the military, and it's hard for me to make friends, especially girl friends, when we move so often. So, the one close girl friend I have lives back in my home town, and she's basically one of the only people that's privy to all of my struggles with infertility. I felt like she was a good person to talk to because she's dealt with similar stuff before. She hasn't been TTC yet, but she's gone through a couple of miscarriages and other reproductive issues, so I thought we were kind of on the same wavelength about how hard this is for me.\n\nWell, yesterday I got a call from my mom. Her friend has a cousin who just gave birth to her 4th child, and the little boy was immediately taken away from her because he was born addicted to drugs. So, basically mom brought up the possibility of my husband and I taking this little boy in and adopting him. I guess in her mind it was perfect because she knows how badly I want a baby and, oh look! Here's a tiny little pre-assembled baby just gift wrapped and ready for me to have! I wish she'd never mentioned this little boy at all. Logical me wanted to be like, \"Well, adoption is a BIG step, and we still want to have children of our own. Plus, this child is addicted to drugs and will probably have health issues that my husband and I aren't necessarily equipped to deal with as first-time parents. Plus, it would be so sudden, and such a strain on our relatively new marriage.\" But the hormonal side of me that wants a baby more than anything in the world was like, \"Fuck yeah, I'll take this baby and love it and squeeze it and give it a home!\" I was irrational at this point, to say the least.\n\nSo, of course, the first thing I do is message my only girl friend to tell her the wonderful news that we may be adopting, or at least fostering, a brand new baby boy. And apparently me mentioning this possibility just unleashed a tide of judgement and truth from her that quite frankly blindsided me. \n\n*\"I thought it was a cute idea for you guys at first and then it seemed like you put a lot of time and research and everything into it and it turned into a kind of obsessive thing.\"*\n\nIt was almost like she was admitting that when I first mentioned us TTC she was merely humoring me. Like it was just this \"cute idea\" that wouldn't really amount to anything. And once I realized I had serious infertility issues I became \"obsessed\". Well no shit I'm fucking obsessed! She's the one person in the world who's supposed to understand that. I don't think she was trying to be hurtful. And I realize I talk a fucking lot about babies and shit, and I'm sure she's probably tired of hearing it (as anyone would be after months of having to hear about it). But it just felt like a punch in the gut, ya know? My one friend. The one person who I thought understood. And now I know the truth. She doesn't understand, because no one I know understands. She went on to talk about how this is probably really not a great thing for a new marriage, and how we are young and have all the time in the world to think about babies. That one almost made me gag, because no. We fucking don't have all the time in the world. We have whatever precious time the military gives us, and even then it all depends on what my body is willing to do for me. \n\nFuck feeling this way. Fuck PCOS. I feel so defeated right now. And it sucks, because I was so hopeful the other day and now I feel like there is this deep dark pit right where my tummy is supposed to be. I don't even want to get out of bed. I feel all kinds of dreadful, with a hefty side of guilt embarrassment to boot.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my wall of text, guys.\n\nEdit: I don't know who keeps downvoting me but it's fucking rude and makes me feel unwelcome. If I've said something to offend, at least send me a PM so I can know what I did wrong.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks to everyone who responded! I haven't gotten to everyone yet, but I feel 100% better about this. As a few of you suggested, I have talked to her. I told her that I understood that maybe I've been a little bit absorbed in the details of TTC, and I understand that it's not all she wants to hear about. I told her that I know friendships can't just be one-sided, and I will definitely work harder on doing less dumping of my problems and more listening. I also explained that I understand some of what I lay on her is intense and she probably doesn't understand what to say all of the time, and that's okay. After all of that I explained how she hurt my feelings and why what she was was insensitive. \n\nAll in all, she's still my best friend and I intend to keep it that way. She apologized and basically reiterated her reasoning for saying what she said, but that she never meant for it to cause me any pain. She said she loves me and wants me to know that I can come to her with absolutely anything, and that she doesn't judge me or think I'm crazy or anything like that. It was an emotional conversation but it turned out better than I could have hoped for, and now it seems that everything is patched up. Again, thank you to everyone who responded. It was really heartwarming to see this post get so much support.
