I'e been a pretty involved person commenting on other posts, but I don't think I've yet to tell me story.  Here it is from the beginning.  \n\nMy husband and I decided before we were married that we would go through our first year without getting pregnant.  We would take all precautions necessary.  I even had one friend say \"You're going to be on birth control *and* make him wear a condom, aren't you?\"  Well, honey, yes.  If that's what it takes.  We are part of a religion that marries pretty young and starts popping out kids fairly quickly.  Getting married in our late 20s is not the norm.  We didn't live together first so we just wanted the first year to be us.  In September 2012 we decided to pull the goalie.  Boy, were we excited...and so naive.  By February 2013, I knew something was wrong.  I had tried tracking temps, ovulation kits, everything I could think of.  I had so many people tell me that we needed to keep trying.  The likelihood of getting pregnant within 2 years was slim.  I'm so glad I didn't listen.  A dear friend gave me the name of her OBGYN.  I made an appointment and saw him in March.  I explained to him the situation and he started me on Clomid starting in April.  It was awful.  The worst emotional roller coaster I could have imagined.  I went the three rounds, increasing dosage each cycle.  By July, my new OBGYN retired and I was assigned another.  He wanted me to go one more round and the same dosage as the third.  I was reluctant, but did it anyway.  Waste of time and money.  No dice.\n\nI was referred to an RE.  We started the blood tests and the ultrasounds and even started seeing a nutritionist.  Husband had a semen analysis and everything looked good.  I had an HSG scheduled the beginning of September.  As some of you ladies know, quite an awful experience.  Now, although the tech can clearly see what's going on, they wouldn't tell me anything.  My RE had to go over the results.  The timing was horrible.  We couldn't get our schedules right and it was an entire month before I could get back in.  Unfortunately it was a day my husband was at work.  So here I was, by myself for yet another appointment, as my RE told me what the problem was.  Too many cysts and fluid-filled tubes.  Tubes are basically withered on the ends and not functioning the way they should.  My only option is IVF.  Further, he was worried that because of the fluid building up, there was fear that it would reflux into my uterus, destroying my uterine lining and decreasing the chance of successful implantation.  He suggested doing a tubal removal.  My ovaries and eggs looked good and uterus looked normal for now.  I could play the chance game or I could move forward with the simple 2 hour laparoscopic surgery.  \n\nWe met again with my OBGYN for the surgery in January 2014.  I had a trip planned for Guatemala in February, so we planned the surgery for later in March.  We did our research and felt that removing my tubes would be the best chance at preserving my uterus for future IVF.  At the time, we didn't have plans in the immediate future for IVF.  We actually had already started going the adoption route.  At this point, we were in the middle of completing classes for our home study.  But we knew at one point, we'd want to try IVF.  So the end of March comes around and my surgery was not a success.  What was supposed to be 2 hours turned into about 5 1/2.  I had so much scar tissue built up from having my appendix removed when I was younger that they couldn't even see through the first scope.  They cut me open.  My doc started to remove parts of one tube and the blood began to flow.  It took 4 trauma surgeons and my doctor to get the bleeding under control long enough to close me up.  Surgery failed.  The recovery was **awful**.  I really wish I had known about this sub then, because I really needed it.  My most depressive period in my life.  I was on short term disability for 6 weeks and hated about 95% of it.  I hated the whole process and wanted to give up.\n\nMay 2014 I went back to work.  Life went back to normal, but I was still on my \"I don't care about kids at all\" road, which of course, not true.  We ended up diving head first into our adoption plan.  We had an amazing case worker and by September, everything was turned in and we waited for our home study to be approved.  We got approved in October and our profile went live in November.  By December it was like my uterus was screaming at me.  I was ready for IVF.  As much as it scared the ever living crap out of me, we needed a baby.  And we were ready to do whatever it took to get one.\n\nNow...for today.  It was the first time seeing my RE since that awful day in October 2013.  I was so excited.  On pins and needles.  My mom and I even planned a trip to Texas in April to seem my sister.  (Flights were **super** cheap today!)  We get into the office and I give him the run down of the last year.  Then he gets into the nitty-gritty.  He starts pulling out charts of ideal weights for IVF...and I'm not near it.  Let me back up a little.  After my surgery, during my depressive stage, I decided I needed to get healthier.  I am 5' 4\".  At the time of my surgery, I was 265 lbs.  My highest weight.  Ever.  Not exactly a goal I had aspired to, obviously.  It just happened.  I got lazy and I really like food.  No excuses.  My weight contributed to some of my surgery complication.  Not a good thing.  So in May, I decided I would get healthier for me.  No fad crash diets, no working out like mad and hating it.  I would make better and healthier food choices and do my best to work out 3-5 times a week.  Most importantly, I wouldn't guilt myself for missing a work out or enjoying some ice cream from time to time.  By October, I was down 30 lbs.  Over the holidays, I put about 8 lbs back on.  Now, here I am, sitting in the office and all I can think of is how it took me 7 months to lose 30 lbs, and I still need to lose 30 more to be at an ideal weight for IVF.  What a crushing blow.  It took everything I had to hold back the tears that were about to overflow.  \n\nI realize that there are so many worse things that I could experience right now.  I realize that 30 lbs may not seem like a big struggle.  But 30 lbs means more waiting.  More waiting for something that I, we, want **so damn bad**.  And that's before we can even start the process.  Any of it.  More waiting.  Now I'm worried that I'll completely stress myself out because 30 lb could mean no baby for awhile.  I don't even know how to process it all right now.  I kept thinking, \"Do I need to get a second opinion?\"  I mean, I know the risks pregnancy and obesity, but there are *plenty* of much heavier women getting pregnant naturally and having healthy pregnancies and babies.  So why am I so freaking special?\n\nRight now, I'm so angry.  I feel hopeless.  I cried as soon as we got into the elevator.  I cried myself to sleep on the highway.  I cried at dinner in Outback.  I did make it to my water aerobics class and I cried the entire way there.  Big, ugly sobs.  And I just still want to cry.  Haven't I given enough yet?  Haven't I wanted it bad enough yet?  Haven't we all?  I try to think about those that have been waiting longer and have been through so much more, but this already hurts so bad.  I can't imagine it hurting so much worse.  I'm just at a loss.  All I want to do is dive into a bowl of ice cream, but in the back of my mind I keep thinking *it will push you farther from getting that baby*.  It's just not fair.  And I'm so over all of it.

Husband and I have met with an infertility specialist and he gave us the best odds using IVF. I think most people here are familiar with the cost. I'm a teacher and my husband teaches and is also finishing a degree. We live pretty well, money isn't tight but it isn't abundant. The cost of IVF is just too much for us. In a few years my husband will hopefully have a job in his field earning a lot more, but we'll both be a few years older and our odds of conceiving a bit lower.\n\nWe've been keeping his parents updated as we've had testing done, my husband had a surgery that didn't help, etc. When we told them about our specialist recommending IVF they immediately said not to even worry about the costs, they could afford to fund it and would be happy to do it. \n\nI feel torn. It's a chance at a baby, we've been trying so long that I feel pretty certain a natural conception just isn't in the cards. MFI is all we are certain of as opks show that I ovulate every month. We're holding back on an HSG because I have a shrimp allergy, apparently there are similarities in the dye and the iodine used in cleaning shrimp? But I've been fine with iodine on my skin when I've donated blood.\n\n*deep breath*...Anyways! It's true that his parents can afford it, they're pretty well-to-do but is it ethical to accept that as a gift? I'm usually a pretty big \"I can make it on my own!\" type of person. Is this appropriate? I really don't know. And oh, I'd just feel so crushed if they paid and it didn't work! Like they wasted their money and we let them down. Does anyone have any experience with this or advice to offer?\n\nEdit 1: Run-on sentence.\n\nEdit 2: Wow you guys don't mess around here! I didn't expect responses so soon! I feel relieved that nobody said it would be awful or greedy to accept the money. You guys gave me some awesome advice and a lot to think over.

The first one, tonight, was not bad. I imagine they'll get worse over time, but here is what we did.\n\n1. Warmed up the substance till it was thinner and more liquid. (Lowered the vial for about 10 minutes in very warm water, then repeated it since it cooled down by the time we did the shot.)\n2. I heated the area with an electric pad for about 5 minutes first.\nI didn't ice the area beforehand. (Read pros and cons of ice first, but I thought the warmed, relaxed muscle was the way I wanted to start out. I'll change if pain gets worse and report back.)\n3. We used a 25 gauge needle.\n4. I leaned on the leg that wasn't getting the shot.\n5. My husband took about 20 seconds to slowly press in the liquid. For the first minute I didn't feel a thing. In the second minute I felt \"something,\" but it wasn't stinging or pain. For today, just a sort of dull pressure/awareness.\n6. He put hot water in a ziplock baggie and that was my warm compress. We alternated pressing down the baggie with massaging the area for maybe 10 minutes.\n\n90 minutes later, it feels normal.\n\nOther info: My dose is 2 ccs, and this progesterone comes in sesame oil. I've read that it's both worse and better than other kinds. Can't compare, since this is my first shot.\n\nSending wishes of strength to anyone who's faced with this treatment. I'm sorry we need to go through this. \n\nI'll report back as the days go by, if it gets worse, I get any side effects, or we change our technique.\n\n**Edited to say 20 seconds, not 2 min, per info from my husband. (Sure felt like longer than a few seconds!)\n\nUPDATE on day 6 of shots: so far nothing more than minor pain. Minor = one quick sting when needle went in and, once, a weird \"awareness of unnormal pressure/intrusion\" feeling in second half of oil being pushed in. But, so far, no agony or bruises or bumps. Sitting on the heat pad now. Really hoping this lasts! (And needs to last!!!)\n\nUPDATE on day 14 of shots: So far, I've felt intense pain once, during a shot. The best way I can describe it is a hook moving around in there -- something unnatural and sort of disgusting and painful. I did cry. We have never used ice, and we continue to use a lot of heat and massage. Yesterday (day 13) for the first time, my hips hurt outside the shots, when I was walking -- felt like I'd been on a hike the day before. That night, the shot was painless. Will continue updates if I have any other useful info.\n\nThe takeaway, so far: the shots themselves have only been truly painful once. And, after 2 weeks, soreness is starting to settle in. Overall, I have to say they were less bad than I was fearing. Obviously unpleasant, but not nightly agony. Hoping others facing PIO have a similar experience, and it's not worse. Hugs to all.

Someone suggested that I post here as well -- note that I'm not sure if i'm fertile/infertile or not, hope that doesn't break any rules.  Anyway, here goes...\n\nMy wife and I are having trouble conceiving and, although we're very happy with each other otherwise, our lack of success is taking a toll on us. My specific issue is that the process has given me a bit of an anxiety, at least around the time that my wife is ovulating. I never really realized that women were only really fertile for 2-3 days per month, and worrying about the need to perform during that small window makes me so anxious that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and I actually cannot get in the mood. (Yup, I get so anxious I can't have sex. Embarrassing.)\n\nI think I might feel better hearing some of your experiences and thoughts on the situation.  Basically, anything along these lines below (which, sadly, I assume pertains to everyone on this subreddit)\n\n* Experienced depression, anxiety, or anything else from the process of trying to conceive and/or had trouble conceiving.\n* Any negative feelings that result from \"forced\" or \"scheduled\" sex when trying to conceive.\n\nMore info/background: I'm a 32 year old man who has been married for 4 years. About 7-8 months ago, my wife and I decided we were ready to start a family. I had NO idea how complicated and stressful that could be. Obviously this was naive, but I didn't know much about female ovulation/menstruation, other than that one dreaded week of the month. When I found out that there was pretty much a two-three day window to conceive within a given month combined with my very busy work schedule and my wife's Type A personality I began to get very stressed.\n\nThe anticipation waiting for that monthly \"sweet spot\" builds up and, to be completely honest, a lot of times I get so anxious that by the time it comes I am not up for sex. The \"scheduling\" of things seems very unnatural and makes it really hard for me to get in the mood.\nI unfortunately now know when ovulation will occur based on my wife's period begin/end dates. She's successfully hid it from me on a few occasions which was really helpful, but that's usually not possible since we obviously live together.\n\nI'm sure people will say \"get help\"... I did go to a counselor of sorts this fall and while it felt good to talk to someone, it didn't really help. Granted, they didn't necessarily specialize in this kind of topic and also were more of the social worker variety than a true psychiatrist. Perhaps the latter would actually be able to help?  I am hesitant because it is a TON of money and the outcome is uncertain...\n\nFinal notes that might be helpful for context: \n* We normally have sex 2-3 times per week, but usually on the weekends when we aren't busy or stressed from work.  This has been a pattern for years, so I guess we should have foreseen that random tuesday night sex was going to be a bit of a change.\n\n* The frustrating thing is we tend to have a lot of sex before and after my wife ovulates when I feel \"normal\"\n\n* We both work long days in corporate jobs that are generally a bit draining. We're not unhappy at work, but tired by the time we get home at 8pm each day.\n\n* Anxiety medicine apparently isn't a good idea since one of the side effects is lack of sex drive.\n\n* In retrospect, I wish we were the couple that just stopped using birth control but never \"scheduled\" when they wanted to conceive... too late, though.\n\nI feel completely ridiculous posting all this, but I'm hoping your thoughts and experiences might make me feel better. I know there are a lot of people out there who've experienced similar stress and/or actual fertility issues.  My wife doesn't know that I'm posting this, but I'm going to show her your replies and I think it will help make her feel a bit better too.  \n\nAgain, apologies if this post is misplaced as I am pretty much new to Reddit.

I'm at the point where I will know once and for all if it's time for me to give up my dream. \nSo, thank you for those of you who read this and allowed me to share a tiny bit of my fears with you. I'm normally a pretty happy and goofy person, but this is some crazy emotional stuff and sometimes I have a hard time dealing with it. \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "1st IVF cycle is coming soon", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2tl70b/1st_ivf_cycle_is_coming_soon/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1422180134, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2tlq5c/sunday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2tlq5c", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 37, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/2tlq5c/sunday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1440946508, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

I don't feel comfortable creating embryos we don't use - by \"use,\" I mean try to our best bring to life through a viable pregnancy. Is that even a realistic goal? I have been reading a ton on the subject, and I realize we would be very fortunate even to have one embryo fertilize, implant and grow to full term. However, the odds are also very real we could have a successful pregnancy or two, and also embryos left over. I just already feel protective over our possible future embryos as little lives we have created, and I feel strongly obligated to give them each the very best possible chance at growing to their greatest potential. I could not be comfortable donating, because they may not ever be picked, especially given our ages. I would not feel comfortable destroying embryos, and I realize that part of this is my Christian viewpoint - even though I'm not the greatest Christian by any standard, I know that my cultural and religious heritage definitely have shaped my moral beliefs, and I believe embryos are lives. Ideally we want a couple kids, and we would be willing and capable of caring for more, but realistically I know a situation is possible in which we create more embryos than I have reproductive years left to grow them. Does that make sense? Can anyone share advice on personal struggles on this topic, or ways to handle IVF so as to not have extra embryos?

My husband and I are Christians have been struggling a lot lately. At least I know I have been. \n\nThis friend also struggled with infertility and after 3 years of trying she and her husband stopped trying and never conceived their own child. Yet their faith grew stronger and stronger. They have also fostered and adopted 12 children. So as can be imagined, she is the one always helping me come back to my faith when I am angry with God and frustrated and not understanding why this is happening to me. Even though I know talking about her infertility brings up the emotions and pain all over again, she still willingly talks to me and calms me down. \n\nI know there are people who are not believers in this subreddit, and I promise I'm not trying to preach to you.

Our desires to become parents are so extraordinary that it is compared to a blazing fire, a dry desert, and death. This helped me to realize that unless someone has gone through what you have gone through, they won't understand how you're feeling. Infertility isn't compared to other people's struggles but rather the earth's phenomenon that \"never say, enough\". We just keep on going. Even when we really don't want to keep going, there's something within us pushing us to keep trying, just one more time.

Pretty much every step had a new setback through the month.  Each time they made notes and said 'next time we'll do X or Y, or we'll start Z sooner'. Unsurprisingly, we failed, as I was shown on Christmas Day by a lovely present from my uterus. Merry Christmas to me, yes?\n\nSince we were out of town for the first few days of my cycle, we opted to take the month off as there really was no way that I could get started on the right track. It was a nice month, with me losing 6 pounds so far on my new diet.  Today is a \"lovely\" Day 1, and the sort of Day 1 that starts off with a sudden blurt and not my typical spotting for a day or two.\n\nI feel like I just can't do it this month again.  I'm telling myself all sorts of logical reasons for that, from the fact that I am going to Las Vegas for a girl's weekend at the end of February, to the fact that I've started losing weight and feel like giving that a bit more time will improve my odds exponentially even by giving it one more month.  And to the fact that with the Vegas trip, and uncertainty about taxes this year that won't be settled until Mid-March when some other forms come from employment - I really don't know if I want to spend the money on things.  We can \"afford\" it, but it's a case of wanting to save the money instead just in case taxes nail us and I go too wild in Vegas.\n\nAll that said, I'm worried that I'm wanting to take this month off instead because I just can't handle failing again so soon after last time.  We've been working at things and suffering setbacks and complications for over 3 years now. Hell, probably close to 5 at this point.  It took us this long to get to IUI and I think I was just too hopeful for that procedure and getting my period on Christmas day absolutely gutted me.\n\nIs it so wrong to take a month off from fear of disappointment and worry that I just can't handle another setback so soon? Am I just fooling myself to think this will ever be easier?  We've drawn a line in the sand, for ourselves, that we likely won't go to the IVF stage of attempts.  It's too expensive and we personally don't feel like we're strong enough to handle that stress.  So we're basically giving IUI our all and then if after 3 or so attempts (however many the doctor wants to try, I guess) we're just.. throwing in the towel.\n\nAm I just a huge wimp for wanting another month off to get myself ready for what is closing in on our last attempts?

I know we all shout at newcomers to get to an RE, the only reason I hadn't yet was because an RE I had a freebie 10 minute consult with agreed that I needed to have the fibroid taken out, so I was waiting for that surgery before proceeding. \n\nStill, I am disappointed in my Gyno. I had my follow-up appointment last week and he never asked me (or my husband) what we thought, what we wanted to do, etc. He just kept saying to wait 6 months, try naturally for 6 months, and then see him if I am not pregnant by the end of the year. FUCK THAT SHIT! This has been 2 years now, and I do have the luteal phase defect/weak ovulation which is why I was on femara, so how does he expect that to be cured from the fibroid surgery??\n\nMy insurance MIGHT cover testing at the new clinic if he would refer me but he won't because he thinks we need to try naturally again. No, just no. We planned financially as though insurance wouldn't cover it anyways. \n\nSo we have an appointment at OHSU in Oregon in March for an evaluation/consultation. I feel like I'm at such a weird place because my OBGYN did SOME tests (HSG, thyroid, AMH, sperm analysis for the husband), did some super basic IUIs (meaning NO ultrasound monitoring), and then the fibroid surgery. No other hormonal testing was done even though I asked for it, he said they only do it in women over 35 (I am 30, will be 31 in March). \n\nSo I have no idea what testing they will want to do or what treatment they will recommend. I guess I wouldn't be surprised if they wanted to do more aggressive IUIs (since the RE I had the free quickie consultation with said that is what they would do to be aggressive before fibroids tried to come back), but when I read about the success stats I just feel depressed. We have already been at this for 2 years. I'm tired of waiting and feeling stuck in limbo. \n\nSo, any opinions on treatments? tests needed?

That has a lot to do with the fact that when I first joined this sub I got to know a lot of the regular users. I followed their stories, I felt their pain with them, their exciment, and I hoped with them each month. And I'm so happy to say that almost every single one of them has moved on to r/infertilitybabies. Which is wonderful!! However, it has actually made this a place that makes me feel incredibly sad now. Another place for me to look around and think \"Wow, everyone else can do it, why can't I?\" And I know it's full of new, supportive members, but that doesn't stop me from getting upset. And I really hate that because this used to be one of my biggest support systems. Now I tend to avoid it more often then not and end up with no one to talk to. \n\nThis last year has been one of the hardest for me because we got stuck in a never ending loop with a doctor who apparently only wanted to see us to get our money. She never did any treatments with us, just sent us away each time telling me to lose more weight. For a whole year. While making me take birth control to force a regular period. I had two pill options for my BC. One made me feel sick, the other absolutely killed my sex drive, so that was fun. I did manage to lose 35lbs and 2 pants sizes, learn tennis, run 2 miles without stopping, and made dead lifts my bitch, so this year did make me healthier. However, it wasn't enough weight for my RE (absolutely no treatment until I'd lost 50lbs), which made me sad, which made me eat, which stopped my progress. Luckily, we have switched to a new RE who is very pro-treatment. He's ready to get started whenever we are. \n\nBut we can't start now because we have to save up first. Of course our insurance doesn't cover shit when it comes to IF, so it's all out of pocket. And since our old RE always said we'd start with monitered clomid and timed sex, we didn't expect our first few cycles to be a huge expense, however, our new RE wants to go straight to IUI since the unmonitered clomid and timed sex didn't work for us in the past. So even though we've progressed, it doesn't feel like we have. And in retrospect, we obviously should've been saving for this the entire year we were with the old RE, but we were being optimistic and putting our money towards getting other bills paid off instead.\n\nI'm not even sure what the purpose of this post is. I guess I'm just a little depressed and desperate to get all of this off my chest. I don't have anyone in my real life I can talk to about this because no one understands, and when I come here I get even sadder because all the old members have moved on without me. \n\n**TL;DR - Fuck Infertility.**", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It's been awhile...", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2u24fx/its_been_awhile/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1422525735, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2u2g4e/thursday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2u2g4e", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 101, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/2u2g4e/thursday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1440938704, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

I was put on birth control which I soon stopped taking because of the side effects, and to my knowledge I don't remember having much effect (but it could be because I stopped taking it SOON after I started, like less than a month.)\n\nWe're looking into Clomid as an option. I don't have any other symptoms of PCOS or endo, no extreme pain when my periods do happen, just the infrequency. I understand that sometimes this stuff can have no symptoms, but I've literally had no symptoms of anything, ever, so my feelings lead me to doubt either of those.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar background &amp; possible experience with Clomid?
