First time poster. My wife and I (same sex couple - she is going to carry our first child) have been TTC since last fall. We\u2019ve been working with a RE the entire time. Did 3 IUIs, with a chemical pregnancy on the 2nd try. Our doctor suggested moving to IVF after the 3rd IUI because he said that most people who can get pregnant with IUI will be pregnant by the 3rd or 4th round. Also, my wife\u2019s insurance has a $10k lifetime maximum, which we would have hit after the first round of IVF if we did a 3rd IUI. Anyway, we had our egg retrieval for IVF on May 8th. They got 9 mature eggs, 6 fertilized, and 3 developed into blastocysts (grades BA, BA, BB). Unfortunately, genetic screening results came back and none were genetically normal so we are back to square 1. We don\u2019t get to see our doc again until June 5th but we know they are going to tell us to try another egg retrieval. It\u2019s not out of the question but even with insurance it is SO expensive and my wife ended up with moderate OHSS from the first retrieval so we\u2019re concerned about that again with a second. It\u2019s also just so emotionally taxing it\u2019s hard to imagine turning around and doing it all again. \n\nAnyway, just looking for any insight anyone might have on this situation.

I am relatively new to reddit, and new to posting in communities in general, but I thought it can\u2019t hurt to give it a try. This is my introductory post about my infertility journey.\n\nMy husband and I are now both 32, and we began trying to conceive in January of 2018. I have not taken any form of hormonal birth control since 2013, we just used condoms in the interim. I jumped in with both feet and started right away with temping, tracking, ovulation predictor tests, knowing my fertile window and my cycle length, timing intercourse precisely, the whole thing. I always appeared to ovulate (usually on CD11), my luteal phase appeared to be consistently 14 days, and my cycle seemed consistently about 25 or 26 depending on if ovulation was day 11 or day 12. Everything seemed great, except I would get heavy spotting for 6-8 days before my full menstrual flow would arrive, and then that would only last about 3 days. The spotting and short period were normal for me, they\u2019d been happening since I came off the birth control in 2013. \n\nAfter 8 cycles of no success and increasing concern over my unexplained spotting I made an appointment with a gynecologist. Not for \u201cinfertility\u201d, more for the abnormal bleeding which I never considered as being anything of interest until I was trying to conceive. She said my spotting was not \u201cnormal\u201d, but also that she didn\u2019t feel it was causing any delay in us conceiving. She did CD2 bloodwork, tested my thyroid, and checked progesterone on 7DPO and everything came back normal. She put me on oral Prometrium 100mg/day anyway to see if it would change the spotting. It did not. So the next cycle she upped it to 200mg/day, and that also did not have any effect on the spotting. She was discussing an endometrial biopsy when I got very ill suddenly with subacute thyroiditis. Without going into that whole story that illness took up a few months, my husband and I kept trying anyway unsuccessfully, and no biopsy was ever scheduled. By that time the gyn simply referred me to an RE.\n\nMy husband and I met with the RE this January 2019. He ordered another CD2 blood panel for me and SA for my husband. Just as before everything looked perfect in my numbers, and my husbands SA also showed great numbers in all stats. I had an SIS that showed nothing notable; the doctor was able to confirm that my left tube was open but unable to confirm or deny the status of my right tube at the time. They said it wasn\u2019t anything to be concerned about.\n\nThe doctor suggested that we try Clomid even though I do ovulate to give us more follicles to work with. We did two cycles using 100mg Clomid from days 2-6 (due to my short cycle and early ovulation). Both times my ovulation was on CD13 instead of CD11 so the Clomid definitely changed something. I responded fairly well, showing many follicles at my mid cycle ultrasounds. The only thing is that they seemed to be getting really big prior to ovulation. Unfortunately I don\u2019t remember the numbers from those first two cycles, but the follicles were growing big and quick before my body geared up to ovulate. We used natural ovulation and timed intercourse both times, as well as Endometrin 200mg/day. The Endometrin actually did put a stop to my spotting! That was exciting, even though we did not have a different outcome from those cycles. It\u2019s nice to know that something can have an effect on whatever the root cause is.\n\nWe took one month off from intervention to try naturally again, and then went in for Clomid cycle number 3. Same as the first two, but this time we used Ovidrel to trigger ovulation about a day earlier than it would have happened naturally and had an IUI. That cycle on a CD9 ultrasound I one follicle already 30mm, and then 3 or 4 others that were not even 15mm yet. The doctor told me to wait until the night of CD10 and then trigger if I hadn\u2019t surged on my own yet. We did the IUI on CD12, my husbands sperm count was great for it (32 million total motile post wash), but no success.\n\nSo now we have just started cycle 20 in this journey. We are going to repeat last cycle with a 4th round of Clomid, probably an Ovidrel trigger, and then an IUI. If this one doesn\u2019t work the doctor has ominously said we will discuss \u201cfurther options\u201d. I am actually not the one in this partnership that is dying to have kids. My husband seems to have always imagined himself as having children, and I never did. As I am sort of ambivalent about it I agreed to give it a try and see what happened knowing that I would be fine either way. However, that was more like when I thought \u201ctrying\u201d just meant having a lot of good sex at the right time and making a baby the fun and free way. This journey has turned into a bigger rabbit hole than I anticipated, and I am in the stage of wondering how many \u201cfurther options\u201d I am open to trying. They just get more invasive, expensive, and time consuming and it seems like a lot for me to go through when I don\u2019t even have this drive to be a mother like some people do (and feel incredible guilt and shame about that). On the other hand, if I choose not to pursue \u201cfurther options\u201d I feel like I\u2019m not allowed to be sad about my situation because I didn\u2019t try every option available.\n\nInfertility sucks, you guys.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13090, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "First Time Posting - Introduction", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559630295, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/btdsh6/first_time_posting_introduction/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "wholefamilyproducts", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_37ehnd8x", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1558947219, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/btjpr7/top_4_tips_on_how_to_properly_detect_ovulation/", "gildings": {}, "id": "btjpr7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/btjpr7/top_4_tips_on_how_to_properly_detect_ovulation/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1558947220, "score": 0, "selftext": "Basal Body Temperature (BBT) is your body\u2019s temperature at rest.

The RE diagnosed me with Stage IV Endometriosis due to the presence of two 3-4cm endometriomas on each ovary. I've gone through one failed IUI since then, on my doctor's recommendation. She's now very adamant that I get ablation surgery on the endo and excise the two endometriomas.\n\nI'm a scientist, so I have access to much of the primary literature and regularly indulge myself in reading studies and reviews on every step of this process. From my research, it seems like there's decent evidence that removing endometriomas may be linked to diminished ovarian reserve and leads to no difference in pregnancy outcomes compared to women with endometriomas who do not get surgery before IVF. Further, surgery seems to be discouraged for fertility alone and only recommended to alleviate pain symptoms. While I have had extreme endo pain in the past, I've found I can greatly reduce flare-ups through changes to my diet, so pain isn't so much of an issue for me right now. To me, it seems clear based on the evidence that I shouldn't get surgery before IVF (especially ablation, given the absurdly high recurrence rates). \n\nI made the case to my doctor for trying IVF first (without really going full let's-discuss-current-literature on her, because I don't want to seem rude). She told me it was my decision, but she still recommends surgery and she disqualified me from the shared risk program, which is a huge financial blow. I feel that this is out-of-touch with current research, since pregnancy rates are statistically the same. Here are my questions: How far do I push the argument against surgery based on current research? I'm fully aware that I'm not that kind of doctor (lol) and respect her expertise, but I can't find good justification for her opinion in the research. I fear that she's just acquiescing to my demands and may subconsciously treat me differently if I go against her recommendation and go straight to IVF. It also makes me worry that my clinic is not up-to-date with scientific literature. Second, if I stay with her, can I make the argument that I should qualify for shared risk, or do I let it go? Is it time to find a new clinic? That thought gives me anxiety, because I just don't want to start over again.

Since I\u2019m going to do IVF in July I\u2019ll probably need to talk to her anyway and let her in on why I\u2019m flexing my hours so much. \n\nI plan to tell her tomorrow that I cannot do the presentation because I have an IUI scheduled for the same day... but HOW!? She may no nothing about what IUI even is or any context \u2014 what\u2019s the best way to explain what I\u2019m going through and why I really cannot reschedule the IUI?? Any help for wording this?

I\u2019m brand new to Reddit but have followed along for years. \n\nWe started trying to get pregnant years ago when we were both around 30 years old. After the first year of trying did all the usual tests and found out my DH has non obstructive azoospermia. Further genetics testing did not reveal anything that would have caused the azoo. All testing on me was fine. Hormones good and tubes open. \n\nWe soul searched for a year after our diagnosis before committing to adoption. \n\nFast forward 5 years. We always kept IVF in the back of our minds and we recently got the call that our Canadian funded IVF chance came up so we decided to go for it. The time between the call and the IVF has been short and I\u2019m trying really hard to get caught up on all the lingo and protocols but I\u2019m drowning and just hoping my RE is choosing a good protocol for us. \n\nWe are starting an antagonist protocol at very high doses. My RE said my AFC wasn\u2019t great at 12. I am 36. My AFC when I was 30 years old was more like 35 so I can see the crazy decline over those 5 years. \n\nI\u2019ll be doing Gonal F 400 and Luveris 150 and then adding in Centrotide on stim day 6. I start my injections this Thursday and I\u2019m SO nervous. \n\nHas anyone done a similar protocol? Any thoughts?\n\nMy DH will be doing micro-tese the same day they do an egg retrieval as our clinic believes that fresh everything works better with testicular sperm if they find any. \n\nSo that\u2019s us!

Was not super thrilled about this, but figured they'd call me back. I didn't here back from them by 12:00 so I left a message for the billing department though the office's patient portal. By 3:00 I still hadn't heard from them, so I called again. \nThe whole of the billing department had already gone home for the day! WTF. The receptionist informed me that I was not the only person calling concerned about this, and that they were returning calls in the order they were received.

I was really trying to wait to make this post until my IVF consult next Wednesday, but I'm having a really hard time with the unknown and not being able to find much information on our scenario. Holy moly this is so long, bless the poor souls that actually read this, but I've been needing to get this off my chest to someone that understands. \n\n**Background** \\- Husband and I have been together 12 years, probably been off birth control 6 years of that time. Not one single positive, ever. My mother had endometriosis and infertility, had a lap and excision and continued to conceive without difficulty. I suspected I had endo as well after realizing not everyone's periods were this bad, had cramping that would take my breath away, cause me to double over, 7+ day periods, painful sex, IBS like symptoms, bladder symptoms, 7-day premenstrual spotting, etc. I eventually take continuous birth control pills, this helps dull some of the symptoms, I normalize all of this as does my OB/Gyn. \n\n**Starting TTC -** We \"don't prevent\" for about 2 years, then get more serious in summer 2017 since we are really ready at this point, I do OPKs \"just to check\" and I was ovulating exactly when I thought. April 2018 I see my OB, tell her my concerns about endo as symptoms have escalated during this time, including severe back and leg pain. She tells me surgery will only hurt my ovarian reserve and make this even more difficult, I look into this and she is up to date on recommendations. She does kind of blow me off (I suspect partially because I'm 28 at the time) tells me to relax, not do OPKs, only have intercourse once every 2-3 days, tells me I'll probably be fine because I'm young. I'm expecting a RE consult from this appt, she instead recommends I take Clomid for three months with 21-day progesterone labs and see what happens. Against my better judgment, I try it because I do know a lot of people that were successful with just Clomid. No surprise, I ovulate just fine and we are unsuccessful.\n\n**Starting with RE** **-** Jump ahead I take the first available appointment with my RE in January 2019. He gives us new found hope and is ready to immediately do an IUI because it's CD5 and then squeeze testing in around this. We do my first transvaginal ultrasound at this appointment, he finds a 4cm cyst on my left ovary so we can't do the IUI this month, but will do labs, HyCoSy, semen analysis, etc. instead and IUI next cycle. Does AFC, never got an exact number but he counted 12+ on one ovary alone, very positive about it. He tells me my uterus is extremely retroverted and is very surprised this has never been mentioned to me before. He asks about pain, etc. and says I most likely have endo but he \"doesn't get too excited about that\".\n\n**Results:**\n\nAMH - 4.55 ng/ML\n\nTSH - 4.37\n\nHyCoSy all clear\n\n*Semen Analysis* (Reference Values)\n\nVolume - 2.0 mL (&gt;1.5mL)\n\nViscosity - high (normal)\n\nSperm Concentration - 103.5/mL (&gt;15million/mL)\n\nTotal Motility - 36% (&gt;40%)\n\nProgressive Motility - 25% (&gt;32%)\n\nTotal Sperm Count - 207 (&gt;39 million)\n\nTotal Motile Count - 74.5 (&gt;9 million) \n\nNormal Morphology Strict Kruger - 4.5 \n\nI start 25 mcg levothyroxine daily for the elevated TSH and we discuss the reduced motility briefly, doesn't seem to be a huge deal, alludes to ICSI for IVF if needed. Then we get to IUI attempt #1, baseline appt cyst is still there, estradiol to make sure it isn't estrogen producing, it isn't so we proceed. I take 2.5 mg letrozole CD3-7 and have first monitoring appt CD 13, as he expects me to ovulate CD 14-15 based on AMH. At CD 13 appt I've already ovulated, I tell him I think I may have ovulated the day before, he's very befuddled by this. \n\n**This is where things get weird -** Next IUI attempt is monitoring day 12, I'm already ovulating because he sees free fluid, states if I ovulate earlier we're going to have even bigger problems, the largest of two follicles is a whopping 35mm already. IUI is unsuccessful. IUI #2 baseline appointment he tells me he \"Doesn't want (me) to freak out\" but it looks like I have diminished ovarian reserve, except my labs are fine. He pretty dramatically goes back and forth about how my labs look fine, but a 35 mm follicle is huge, but I'm only 29, producing two follicles on such a low dose, etc, etc.  At the time DOR was not on my radar because of my AMH result and I knew almost no specifics. I ask what this all means, asked several other questions and he tells me honestly he just doesn't know. He seemed so shocked himself that he really couldn't explain anything at all to me. Annoying, but he seems like he genuinely cares and he was trying to figure it out. \n\nWondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar. I \\*think\\* this may mean I have high FSH but I haven't had it tested to know for sure, and I'm really just trying to piece this together. At a later appointment, he did say he does think IVF \\*can\\* work for us, but we just haven't gone into all the details yet. He brought me in even earlier for IUI #3 and increased letrozole dose to try for 3 follicles, at day 11 the largest follicle was already 26mm with no positive OPK yet. Again, said I make large follicles really fast but I just need more understanding and I want to be more prepared for my consult. My cycles before this were 29-32 days (two outlier cycles were 27 days in the last 5 years), everything I read said this was reassuring. Since taking letrozole and levothyroxine they have been 26 &amp; 27 days long with a short follicular phase which I understand is not reassuring. I'm kind of wondering if the subclinical hypothyroid was causing my cycles to be longer and covering this up? I see short cycles mentioned with endometriosis, but with long follicular phases. Also, DOR seems to go along with endometriosis. Has endo damaged my ovaries? Is it possible despite my AMH I will be a poor responder during IVF? Will it be very unpredictable?  I know a lot of people that have had to do varying levels of infertility treatments, but I do not know anyone that has gone this far, for this long, without ever having a single positive, especially at peak fertility ages. That part has always concerned me, a long time ago \"when\" turned into \"if\" and this makes me even more afraid to have any hope at all.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13118, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction &amp; DOR symptoms with normal AMH", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559651509, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/buk97n/introduction_dor_symptoms_with_normal_amh/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "eatsleepread78", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_31j7j5kr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1559167532, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bukxrv/embryo_adoption/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bukxrv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 26, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/bukxrv/embryo_adoption/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1559167534, "score": 12, "selftext": "Does anyone out there have experience with embryo \u201cadoption \u201c?

Had an overall positive experience, with some weird details thrown in (long lines, major lack of privacy, cultural differences related to food/drink etc). Cost is definitely low, but I probably wouldn't recommend it as an IVF tourist destination (but I recommend it if you're already here).\n\n \n\nIVF in China\n\nWe live in a 2nd tier city in China, and my husband and I both work here. We went through the IVF process at a major public hospital in our city. It\u2019s a women and children\u2019s hospital (top in the city; it\u2019s a research hospital. If you want the name send me a PM).  \n\nInitially, the biggest barrier was finding information, since I\u2019m hardly conversational in Mandarin and didn\u2019t want to let friends/colleagues know what we were up to, so had to avoid direct questions. I eventually found a private, English-speaking clinic that provided translators for procedures at Chinese hospitals. The translator was able to get me A LOT more information,  as well as set up appointments and such. Her quoted price for the entire procedure, from initial consult to embryo transfer, was 1,000 RMB (just under $150 USD) and honestly I would\u2019ve paid her more cause she did so much work for us.\n\nThe first appointment was overwhelming. All in one afternoon, I did: pap smear, transvaginal ultrasound, breast ultrasound, chest x-ray, and ECG. Most of the results were ready either immediately or an hour or two after the procedure, and could be printed from a machine in the hallway.  A couple days later I did some fasting bloodwork. I was entered in a clinical trial where they measured my oxidative stress at a couple points in my IVF cycle. I haven\u2019t seen any results on that. But they also tested hormones, blood type, karyotyping, and various STIs. My husband did some blood work as well that included some of those same tests. Once all the results came in (which took over a month), we had an apt for the Dr to look over the results, and once approved, everything (including proof of identity and marriage) had to be scanned and uploaded to a government website for approval. Then we had to make hospital files  that contained scans of our passport and marriage license, and had to be under a Chinese name (so we made something up). The file making process took about all day. Though I was impressed that my husband\u2019s file was made by a male fertility specialist, who went over his SA and did an exam to check for varicosity. No need for a referral to another clinic to get his side of things checked out.\n\nOne thing you have to understand about a Chinese public hospital: waiting in line for over an hour is normal, and waiting for three hours happens from time to time. These hospitals have adopted methods to deal with the massive population, and that involves taking a number, waiting for ages, and having little privacy (HIPPAA isn\u2019t a thing here). Once you get called back, say for a monitoring ultrasound, you go to the room, wait in line there for a bit, and when you finally cram inside with 10-15 other patients in the same tiny room, you hand your paperwork to the assistant at the desk, avert your eyes from where other women are getting undressed for their ultrasound, and when it\u2019s your turn you just strip down and climb on the table, pretending no one can see you. Most women will wear a dress or long shirt for a little additional privacy. There\u2019s no paper sheet covering your lap, just one on the table under your butt that you throw in the trash when you\u2019re done to make room for the next person. Sound scary? You\u2019ll get used to it.\n\nMy baseline for stims was on March 1st, and we were good to go! I got a prescription for enough gonal f to cover the first 6 days, and went to the injection room for my first shot and training on how to do it. A lot of women just went to the clinic every day rather than do the shots themselves. But I found that inconvenient. The first week, things were chugging along. I was given a new prescription for meds when I went in for monitoring rather than buying everything at once. By the second week, though, I was going in every day, which meant I was only buying one day\u2019s meds at a time. It also meant I was there basically 3 hours every day, which sucked schedule-wise since I was still working. My job is semi-flexible, but I started to get complaints from students about classes being moved constantly, which added to my stress.  \n\nI finally got a date for the trigger shot: Wednesday the 13th! Because my egg retrieval would be at 8:45 am on Friday, I had to go in to the hospital at 8:45 at night to get this done (they didn\u2019t allow IM shots in the butt to be done at home \u2013 it\u2019s actually illegal for me to have access to that kind of needle). The hospital was dark and creepy, but I went to an inpatient ward and a nurse who spoke English gave it to me at the right time. The next day, I checked into the hospital at 2pm for my inpatient procedure.  I paid 250 RMB ($37 USD) for a bed in a double room rather than triple room (no single room available) and my roommate was super sweet. She and her husband spoke a little English and they ordered some food for me, and wouldn\u2019t let me pay them back.\n\nNext day was egg retrieval. I was woken at 6:45 by a nurse taking my temperature. Then a phlebotomy cart came by to take my blood. Soon, it was time to go to the waiting room for the procedure. A big group of us walked there together. I was the fourth to be called from that group (an unlucky number in China, but hey, it's high on the list!): the nurse called me back by calling \u201cthe foreigner\u201d rather than my name (she probably couldn\u2019t pronounce it). Everyone in the waiting room chuckled. The first thing we had to do was remove our shoes and socks and put on slippers provided for us, so no special socks for the procedure. Then we were split up.\n\nA nurse handed me hospital clothes and motioned getting undressed, so I did that. She tied my hospital clothes for me, tucked my hair into a cap, and pointed at a toilet. I got the picture. A minute later, I was sitting on a bench with three other women, two of whom had IVs and one who was getting one. One woman said she recognized me from the outpatient department a few days before. I had gotten fed up with waiting for the injection room, and I sat right down and did my own injection in the hallway. They said they thought I was brave.  I wasn\u2019t able to communicate that no, I wasn\u2019t brave, I was just hormonal, impatient, and a little pissed off.\n\nI got my IV, waited, and was taken down the hallway to wait some more. I could see a long hallway with multiple ORs on either side. Every now and then a stretcher with a groggy looking woman would be wheeled out. Soon, I was taken to an OR.\n\nThe OR was\u2026 chaos. It was dark, but there were a LOT of people inside, and the first thing I saw was the naked lower body of another women on the bed in stirrups in front of me. I averted my eyes, but there were at least 5 other beds with 5 other naked women, and several Drs/techs per patient. There was constant movement and noise around me and I was in a bit of shock. Then the woman in front of me got up (she didn\u2019t seem sedated) and I was instructed to take off my pants and lie down.  There was a giant spotlight shining at my naked crotch.  The male Dr sitting there asked me where I was from, and said \u201cIt\u2019s a very beautiful city.\u201d I thought: this is an odd thing to be talking about while naked. Then I was out.\n\nI was comfortably tucked in a bed being moved somewhere. I wondered if this meant the procedure was finished. I asked, \u201cfinish ma?\u201d Someone said, \u201cyes, finish\u201d.  \n\nAfter a brief time in a recovery room, I was taken back to my room and had some lunch delivered.  Later the Dr came by and said because they got 27 eggs I was at risk for OHSS, so I was to stay inpatient over the weekend to try to prevent it. Luckily, a single room had become available so I moved there. Over the weekend I received IV fluids every day, and was instructed to \u201ceat LOTS and LOTS of shrimp\u201d (for the protein) and \u201cdrink hot watermelon juice, cold won\u2019t do.\u201d The staff was also unhappy that my husband went home to sleep at night, but honestly I think we both slept better that way.\n\nCome Sunday afternoon, sure enough my belly had inflated and was painful, so I was kept for a few more days.  Cue more class rescheduling for me and less time at the hospital for my husband since \\*gasp\\* he had to work! We got our embryo report on Monday, though, which we both had to be physically present for. Out of 27 eggs retrieved, 21 were mature, 19 had fertilized, and 9 made it to day 3. We were informed that four embryos had already been frozen at this stage, two per straw, and five more were being cultured to blastocyst. And after a couple more days of IV fluids and meds, I was finally released on Wednesday. Come day 5, we were told we had 1 blastocyst and two still growing, and by day 6 we had one more. Of course, both of these reports required us to take time off work and come to the clinic in person. Plus, I was told to spend the next two months resting and recovering, and we\u2019d do a frozen embryo transfer in May.\n\nFast forward two long months\u2026. My period started on my 29th birthday. I went in for a baseline ultrasound the next day and got a prescription for estrogen. At first lining check, they said \u201ceverything looks normal, your lining is 4.5.\u201d I was worried but thought maybe it was supposed to grow more\u2026 but come the next lining check, it was exactly the same. Apparently they only measure half the lining! In American terms, my lining was 8.9. Then it was PIO for 5 days until transfer.\n\nTransfer was interesting. My husband was required to be there to sign papers, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to go back with me. I was changed into hospital garb (just like for retrieval), my hair covered and given a hospital wristband. Then I was taken back to a room labeled \u201cEmbryo Ransfer of Room 2\u201d where upon entering, I saw two women lying very spread eagle in stirrups while several other patients and workers stood around waiting/watching. There was a little glass door leading to (I assumed) the lab and every now and then a long plastic tube would be passed through. Several doctors/nurses were making small talk with me, very curious about details of my life, surprised to see a foreigner. Finally it was my turn. I stripped in front of everyone, and in went speculum and then embryo without ceremony (and no picture of it, or ultrasound of it going in either). Then I was immediately instructed to get up and dress, and I was taken to a recovery room by wheelchair where I laid in bed for 30 minutes while someone gave further instructions in Chinese (but my translator wasn\u2019t allowed in for this part). Then I left! I was given two weeks worth of progesterone and estrogen and instructed to come in 14 days for a blood test. According to my translator, I was to resume normal activity, but rest more, keep my belly warm, drink only hot water (nothing cold) and avoid spicy food. I\u2019m not sure how much of this was from the doctor and how much was from the translator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept a detailed record of expenses throughout the egg retrieval cycle (all in all we spent around $4,000 USD for the stim cycle including meds, diagnostics, and hospitalization) but I slacked off during the FET cycle. I\u2019ve kept all the receipts (I think) and one of these days I\u2019ll go through them and add everything to the spreadsheet, which I\u2019m happy to share if anyone wants.\n\nSorry this was so long! There were so many weird details I wanted to include! But the big question may be, would I recommend China for IVF tourism? Honestly no\u2026 if you already live here, it\u2019s great!

We submitted all of our records and completed all \"portal\" information back in March.  Because they stress the importance of getting records and information in, 10 days prior to the phone call, one would would assume the reason would be so the doctor has an opportunity to review and develop a plan to present to you based upon your specific case and individual needs.  \n\nOur call was scheduled at 11 and my husband was going to meet me in my work's parking lot so we could be together during the appointment.  The doctor called at 10:15, saying she was running early and understood when I kindly asked that she call back around 11 so my husband could be present.  \n\nThe first question she asked was when my last period was. Okay,  cool, that's important information. \n\nThen she asked \"and the sperm count/morphology was good?\" \n\nPause. \n\n\"Um, no, that's one of our concerns... I'm sorry,  did you not receive the records we sent in? I called a month ago to double check that they made it there.\" \n\n\"Yes, I have them.  Any cancer in the family?\" \n\n\"Yes,  my mother blah blah blah... it should all be in the portal and records, so I'm just going off of my memory with dates.\" \n\nShe then asked if I had any surgeries, if my paps were normal and if we had any previous treatments.\n\nI explained these we had two failed IUIs with meds and that's why we were considering IVF. All test results should be in the portal and records.\n\n\"Yes, we got the results but our computer system is cumbersome so it helps when the patient can supplement the information\". \n\nShe then asked if I was familiar with IVF to which I responded yes, and she proceeded to explain to me what the process for IVF is and what the schedule looks like...all information I could glean from their website.  It felt like she was literally reading from their website. Then she told me to start taking a vitamin I could find on Amazon.  She then asked if I had any questions. I was so angry I said no. \n\n\"You don't have ANY questions?\" \n\n(Very politely, I may add)\n\"To be honest,  I'm a little disappointed in this phone call,  we've waited 4 months and sent in all of our paperwork and anticipated hearing a plan specific to our needs, and it seems that information hasn't been reviewed in depth to present us with our next steps, tailored to our specific case.\"\n\n\"...Wow.\" \n\nShe apologized that we felt disappointed and said if we had any questions we could reach out.  \n\nWhen we hung up I immediately burst into anger- tears.  \n\nThat was it. The phone call from start to finish was 11 minutes. My husband and I took off of work for this?! Their computer system is cumbersome?! You guys are making babies with the miracles of modern science but you can't figure out your damn computer system?! There is no way she reviewed any of our records. She could've at least skimmed through them between the first time she called and the second phone call!  We've put things on hold for 4 months waiting for this phone call. And on top of everything, when she said \"...wow\", she said it like I was being rude.  I asked my husband (who, trust me,  wouldn't lie about this) if I had at all been rude or disrespectful and he assured me I had not.  \n\nI'm so angry. I know there is a waiting list until March 2020 for these consultation calls and I sincerely hope our phone call was the exception; hopefully not all consultation calls are like ours was.  If you are on the waiting list,  I highly recommend not putting your life on hold or anticipating a grand game plan based upon your reproductive needs.  I know they offer a very inexpensive IVF protocol, but I was not anticipating \"you get what you pay for\" in a phone call. \n\n4 months.  What a colossal waste of time.

I'm new to the infertility sub, and it was like an easter egg moment when I discovered a random post written by a physician in training... it's such a unique, ridiculous (and don't forget ironic) situation that I wanted to see what other peoples' thoughts are - as I think there are quite a few people here with medical backgrounds. I just NEED to understand how other people are doing this. We put off our entire lives through residency and fellowship to get to this point, and then seem to still have no time to deal with the ramifications it has on our lives and fertility.\n\nMy background: a neonatology fellow in a level IV with very heavy service/call obligations that are often just brutal. There is no time for anything, as we all know. I've had a couple of my co-fellows go through infertility treatment and difficult pregnancies and it is just effing terrible. One was on service, couldn't move things around, was covering the L&amp;D and trying to sneak in monitoring ultrasounds while doing her IVF cycle simultaneously during the day. She was so traumatized by it because she also has a very sensitive medical history and didn't need half the unit up in her business - considering we all have access to the L&amp;D boards and are pretty much obligated to know what's on it, especially when she was admitted for prolonged monitoring due to complications and her entire history was out there in her H&amp;P section. But we also must use our hospital for care due to insurance and we also get all the high risk referrals. WHAT GIVES?\n\nInfertility background: 30yo with mild PCOS, husband is 32 and also a physician, our hospitals are not located close together. Getting a semen analysis done was practically an act of god as he is OR based and has absolutely no flex time or ability to just duck out for an hour or two even to go to the next building over. Most of his calls are late calls rather than overnights with a post call day, so that doesn't really help. We weren't sure that it was actually going to happen until he physically left the hospital to walk across the street to do it, and quite honestly, he would have stopped halfway through had his pager gone off while there if one of his residents was trying to reach him. He will always put his patients first. I at least have the benefit of post call days because I have so many calls. Double edged sword.\n\nWe are gearing up for IUI due to mild PCOS symptoms (mildly but not horribly off LH/FSH/testosterone, incredibly irregular cycles and ovulation maybe a couple times a year). The semen analysis wasn't perfect (kind of lowish morphology and 2+/3+ progressive motility) but with high enough counts that we think there's enough good sperm in there %age wise. I, obviously, need to ovulate.\n\nIUI question: How did you and your RE truly weigh the pros and cons of Clomid cycles vs gonadotropin cycles to absolutely maximize your chances of success?  I know for some people, the deciding factor is that they don't want to spend money on gonadotropins for IUI when IVF generally has a much better chance of working, and I would love to hear some perspectives on how people made this decision. All of the above said - I just can't see how it would be even remotely possible to fit in all the monitoring appointments IVF would require. With relatively mild PCOS symptoms and a not great but still &lt;30 BMI, my feeling is that with the right protocol IUI actually probably has a pretty good chance of working, but we need to do it aggressively and not view it as a stopgap to getting to IVF... but I also don't want high risk quads either, you know?\n\nMany thanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13145, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "1) IUI modalities &amp; 2) thoughts on work obligations vs treatment for physicians with infertility?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559657665, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/buvm5b/1_iui_modalities_2_thoughts_on_work_obligations/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1559235978, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/buvotg/thursday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "buvotg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 128, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/buvotg/thursday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1559235979, "score": 14, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything NOT necessarily related to infertility or treatment.
