We're going to ask if she would be prepared to do a further full cycle so we could go down the 'fresh' route as when we chatted to the embryologist her view was that around 60-70% of frozen eggs survive the thaw, then around the same fertilise and the thought of just having the one blast at this stage too leaves me feeling miserable before I've even started.  \n\nThere's another 'maybe' who is a fresh cycle but she's unproven fertility, exact match on height, hair &amp; eyes, and sounds a lot more like a 22-yr old me, much more driven and career-focussed.

If you haven't seen it, there's a trailer on the website: https://vegasbabyfilm.com/\n\nIn summary, the film follows several infertile couples who have entered a contest to win a free IVF cycle through Sher Fertility clinic in Las Vegas. The couples submitted videos explaining why they should be chosen and then a panel from the clinic chose a winner from the top 10 videos that received the most votes online.\n\nThe contest portion of the film made me so angry. I cried through the first 30 minutes thinking about it. All of these couples deserve to win. All of US deserve to win. I found it terribly unethical to get the hopes up for all of these couples and only one is chosen, for just a single cycle. If you want to give away a cycle, fucking give it away randomly, you don't need to put everyone through this. And as we will know, IVF does not always equal baby. I was relieved to learn they have since stopped hosting the contest.\n\nThe rest of the film was realistic. They followed the treatment for several of the couples (the runners up got discounts on treatment). A few of them had failed transfers or miscarriages then had success. One couple never had a baby by the end of the film. Though of course the contest winner ended up with a baby because everybody likes a happy ending, Hallmark channel style.\n\nThere was one moment in particular that got me right in the feels. One of the women was pursuing treatment as a single parent. She worked as an actress and Lady Gaga impersonator. She had a huge smile and a certain brightness just radiated from her at the beginning of the film. Later on in the course of her treatment when she's attending a support group meeting, her face is like a mask, all of the brightness seemingly drained from her. I feel the same way.

This sub-reddit has taught me to be an advocate for myself within the impersonal 'medical-industrial complex' - so thanks! I\u2019ve been following along with your stories and progress since around 2015, when I was deep in denial about my own infertility - at the time, I was only a year into trying.  Now, I have three years under my belt. At first I couldn\u2019t shake the thought that it would happen naturally, and then as I moved on to more and more procedures, I thought that whatever current procedure was underway would succeed. I am now post hope, but not yet willing to give up. \n\nAfter 5 IUI\u2019s (2 with clomid and trigger; 3 with FSH injectibles and trigger), 1 diagnostic laparoscopy and ablation of small amount of endo, 1 IVF cycle and still no answers, I am hoping for some insight from the wealth of collective knowledge of this group. My partner is 32 and I am 36. My partner initially had low count on 1st semen analysis, but subsequent SA\u2019s were within normal range. For me, other than Stage 1 endo (like smallest traceable amount), I don\u2019t have any known issues that would cause infertility. I have never been pregnant. \n\nHere's a summary of my procedures and some questions to follow:\n\n**AMH** (tested on Sept. 2015) - 27.33 (high end of Medium Range - Canadian scale)\n\n**IUI** #1 and #2 - small amount of clomid, high responder - negative\n\n**IUI** #3 and #4 - FSH injectibles, dominant follicle - negative\n\n**Diagnostic laparoscopy** and ablation of the smallest amount of endo to be found\n\n**IUI** #5 - FSH injectible, dominant follicle - negative\n\n\n**First and so far only IVF (early January 2017):**\n\nCD1 - AFC: 10 right; 8 left\n\nDrugs: Puregon (166IU) and Menopure (75IU) starting on CD1; Orgalutran starting on CD9 to CD12; Trigger on CD12\n\nEstradiol level on CD13 = 16,331\n\nLining on CD14 = 13mm\n\n**Retrieval on CD14**: 21 eggs retrieved; 20 mature; 17 fertilized with ICSI\n\n\n**Post Retrieval**\n\nDay 2: 15 embryos remaining\n\nDay 3: 15 remaining\n\nDay 4: 12 remaining\n\nDay 5: 11 embryos still in transition, none made to blastocyst stage as of 7am\n\nDay 6: 3 embryos (grades: 2BC, 3CC, 3BB) made to blast and were frozen\n\n\n**freeze all cycle b/c potential for OHSS \n\n**I did not get PGS or PGD testing - not available in my area\n\n**FET #1** - medicated\n\nCD1: started 4mg of estrogen (Estrace) 2 times daily\n\nCD10: lining 11mm\n\nCD13: started progesterone suppositories (Endometrium) 3 times daily\n\nCD21: FET day - transfer of best embryo (3BB)\n\nBeta 12dp5d (May 5): negative\n\n**Q\u2019s for you**:\n\n* What happened to embryos post retrieval between Day 5 and 6? I heard that 50% loss is to be expected, but we had over 70% loss!?! In my follow-up appointment, my Dr said it was an egg quality issue. Really? How do they know? Has anyone else had a similar drop off and what was the explanation?\n\n* Next steps - further testing, or should I do another embryo transfer? My hesitation is due to having gotten a yeast infection from all of the suppositories and I wonder if any associated inflammation affected my transfer. Did anyone else experience an infection from FET suppositories? \n\n* Has anyone done back-to-back FET's or is it generally recommended to take breaks between?\n\n* Does anyone have a similar history as me? If so, what is your strategy moving forward? Are you seeking additional testing? \n \n\nApologies for the massive amount of data. Thanks for reading and for any responses.

He said he couldn't believe the other urologists we've seen never did or said anything about them. Apparently they wreak havoc on sperm and destroy the DNA which causes low counts but normal looking sperm. They also destroy DNA which causes low fertilization rates even with ICSI. Our last IVF cycle had 16 retrieved, 11 mature, and 2 fertilized. Both a bust. They didn't know why. Maybe an egg issue even though I've always checked out clean and clear. But with eggs I think you can never tell even if they look great which they said they did. So we were going to do a 50/50 cycle this round with donor sperm for the first half of eggs and my husbands for the other half. \n\nAnywho, he also ran a bunch of tests and one was to test his thyroid again. Apparently my husband now has hypothyroidism. He's never had a thyroid problem until now and we've been infertile with unexplained MFI for 10 years. \n\nOur urologist said there was no significant research showing there was an impact from hypothyroidism and infertility in males. But sent us to an endocrinologist to see what she said. During the appt. she confirmed that there have been no major research done on the topic to prove it causes infertility. It's mainly been confirmed in women only. But she said that she would postpone our upcoming cycle if it were her. She said it wasn't a medically made decision rather just a personal opinion to see what the meds do. She didn't think we would see a significant jump in count and it wouldn't cure his infertility but we might see a small increase in motility or morphology. Which he doesn't have an issue with it's mostly just a low count for some reason. But she did say it was ultimately our decision. \n\nIt just seems weird that my husband has never had a thyroid problem before and we've been infertile all this time even with a healthy thyroid. The only thing that has always been around is the white blood cells. But no other urologist has ever been alarmed about them until our new urologist! \n\nNow we have to decide whether or not to cancel the cycle by tomorrow (it's my CD2 and would be my start of BC pills). Sobbing crocodile tears. We have a baseline appt. on June 1st and the next cycle starts in August. I guess I understand why we should wait. My husband has another SA to see if the white blood cells are out of his system yet too! He did one last week but the lab messed up and didn't test for white blood cells. Of course! \n\nI just wish she were more confident on why we should wait not just \"to see if the meds do anything.\" I'm so sick of this waiting game! Sigh. It's such a hard decision, but I don't want to waste money and a cycle if maybe the thyroid could possibly help. But I also don't want to miss out on a cycle for no reason. \n\nHas anyone experienced any of this? Any help would be appreciated! Also, sorry for the long post! And thank you so much for reading!

After his sister commented that maybe not having the stress of my old job will help with the situation (I was recently laid off), we removed ourselves after 20 minutes. \nThen we went to visit my husband's dying grandmother in the hospital who waited for him to go to the bathroom before she asked why we hadn't given her any grandchildren. \n\nWe drove to the beach let out a primal scream. \n\nThen this Monday we found out two friends gave birth over the weekend, both who started trying WAY after we did (one who has had two kids since we started trying) and another friend blithely texts that she is pregnant, even though she knows everything we are going through.

I'm 24 and struggling. My cycles are normal, I've gotten a CD3 blood test, internal/external ultrasound of my ovaries/pelvis, HSG, Pap smear, and std tests. Everything came back normal. Husband just got his SA results which were normal. I don't know if I'm ovulating, temping didn't work for me and opks were inconsistent at best.\n\nFinally going to see a specialist at the end of the month. I cannot carry twins due to my cerebral palsy so they've told me clomid is out. And I just found out IUIs are covered but IVF would be $13,000 per treatment! :(\n\nI just looked at adoption prices (I don't want to foster to adopt at the risk of loving the child and having it taken away) but the average cost of private adoption in California is $35,000-$40,000. I thought it was around $10,000-$15,000.\n\nI feel lost and scared, I've cried twice this week. I don't know how to handle this. I just want to be a mom. I'm not rich by any means and I'm feeling hopeless after hearing all of those numbers, especially since a couple of them aren't even guaranteed.\n\nDo any of you have any test recommendations that I could ask for from the specialist? Any IUI experience? Adoption info? Any advice would be wonderful, or just saying hello would be nice too.\n\nThanks for reading \ud83d\udc9a", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Going through it...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6aorvn/going_through_it/"}, {"author": "DammitHardison_", "author_created_utc": 1442954047, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_qo0kk", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1494561427, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6ap3vs/surrogacy_legit_companies/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6ap3vs", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6ap3vs/surrogacy_legit_companies/", "retrieved_on": 1497132530, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "My Infertility is on my husband's side (MFI) and we have had one successful round of IVF.
