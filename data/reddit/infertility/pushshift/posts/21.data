I was there, I asked those questions (albeit in TFAB or TTC30). \n\nI'm also aware that some diets actually do help -- some people say keto helped their PCOS and they conceived naturally, and research shows getting yourself into a healthy BMI gives you a fertility boost (statistically speaking). As for supplements, I think we have a group consensus that CoQ10 is at best harmless and may do something for egg quality, and DHEA is cool if your doctor is on board. I think it would be good to have this community wisdom gathered in a central place where we could point new people to, and possibly encourage them to read there, and maybe ask the question in TFAB or search whatworkedforme, before posting here.\n\nI'm asking for this because personally, my husband and I both have legit medical conditions that require $20,000 worth of extreme science in order to have a shot at a baby. This sub has been my home for two years while I deal with that exquisitely painful fact, supported by other men and women who are in the same boat. No herb or diet modification will ever help me, and that is true for the majority of people in this sub. I genuinely enjoy answering questions from new people when I can be helpful, but I don't think we should have to see these posts over and over and be reminded that there is literally no hope that any of these things will ever work for us, especially when there are plenty of other TTC subs where these questions would be normal. \n\nAlso these posts tend to get downvoted, which is probably confusing and hurtful for the OP, who is also likely in a painful place already if they're asking these questions. I don't want to scare away new members because they violated an unwritten rule. I'm not sure what the answer is from a moderation standpoint, or if anyone besides me cares enough to make a rule about these posts.

His DNA fragmentation (originally 47.5%) decreased to 33.6, which according to the lab results, still put as in the \"poor fertility potential, IVF/ICSI recommended\" category. I'm not worrying about this last result too much at this point as it's a somewhat controversial test and the research on it could be better (like everything in this shitty IF world.) The clinic did not send me the morphology results, not sure why, I asked the admin but she's away for a few days.\n\nObviously we're really happy with these results. The count and motility are basically \"normal\". Morphology was always really low (1%), so we'll see what that result is, but I know morphology isn't as concerning to doctors as the other factors. \n\nBecause of these results, and the fact that I am starting a new job tomorrow, we've decided to try naturally until June and re-evaluate at that point. However, I'm very frustrated with our RE, when she called to tell me the results I asked what her recommendation was for next steps and she said \"you can come in for a funded IVF.\" I asked if IUI may be more appropriate given the results, and she said, yeah, you could do that. I asked about injectables and she said \"we can decide that when you come in for monitoring.\"\n\nI do not want to make that sort of decision on a whim, at a monitoring appointment. That seems odd, right? What if she's not in that day? Another doctor is going to make the plan or I have to come back again the next day? Her tone was SO dismissive, it was clear she wanted to get off the phone as quick as possible. (I also don't want to seem ungrateful that we get one funded IVF, while many people have to pay every time, but we have already paid for one cycle, it didn't go that well, and given my new job, I don't want to do it again unless it's truly the best medical choice for us.)\n\nThe other issue is that for the past three cycles, my luteal phase has been nine days. My average is 12, but nine seems really short. This was the original issue I was concerned about last summer, and at that time the RE looked at my progesterone result 7 days post ovulation and said she wasn't concerned at all. For reference, my progesterone was 23.2 nmol/l, which is equivalent to 7.3 ng/ml. \n\nANYWAY - do y'all think I should consider switching REs? I could perhaps see someone else at the same clinic. Or is her behaviour par for the course? And if you had a similar situation, after trying for a few months naturally, would you move to IUIs or IVF?

IUI would be $1600 + meds.  In an ideal world I would like to try one cycle of IUI just to ease into the hormones and see how I tolerate them.  But I don't see spending $3000 (or more?

Additional FETs are $1850.\n\nWe go to Shady Grove and with their \"multi-cycle discount\" we can do two IVF cycles with unlimited FETs (assuming I make any embryos) for $21,500 + meds + $2000 for PGS (or hopefully $4000 if I get more than 5 embryos worth testing from two cycles).  If you get a baby from the first cycle, the program is complete and you forfeit the extra money you paid.

His sperm concentration and morphology were/are a bit low (morphology was 3.5%, but I can't remember the concentration number), and my progesterone was low. \nWe tried four unmonitored cycles of Letrozole/Femara + timed intercourse, with no pregnancy. As far as I know, the drug did what it was supposed to do, in that I was ovulating consistently while taking it. (I was getting positive results on OPKs and a rise in basal temperature around day 12/13 of my cycle). \nToday we finally went to see a fertility specialist. I had a (vaginal?) ultrasound - no cysts or fibroids, which is good news. Ovaries look good. Today I start Clomid (which I'm apprehensive about, too much Googling) and tomorrow I go back for an HSG (which I'm quite anxious about because medical procedures just make me completely nervous in general). If the HSG is all clear we'll be trying our first IUI next week.\n\nI guess I'm mostly just looking for some positive feedback/advice/wisdom because I'm feeling like an emotional wreck right now and we haven't even really begun. I have a few friends who I've talked to about this, but none of them have actually been through it.  \nDid any of you have an HSG that went smoothly with limited pain/strife?  Anyone try Clomid with any success (minimal side-effects and/or multiple eggs released that cycle)?\nAlso, how are your partners coping with all of this?  My husband isn't necessarily being as supportive right now as I need him to be, but I think he might just be shell-shocked.\n\nEdit: Left out a word.\n\nUpdate: Wanted to provide this for others who might have an upcoming HSG and be as nervous as I was. I had mine yesterday and thankfully, like many of you said, it was nowhere near as bad as I made it out to be (mostly because my tubes were completely clear, I think). The most unpleasant part was when they inserted the speculum... I hate those things.  Other than that I had some very minor discomfort and cramping. Period cramps for me on the pain scale are maybe a 4-5, this cramping was like a 2. And I got to watch the fluid on the monitor, which was pretty neat :).  If I have more than one mature follicle when I go in for my ultrasound on Tuesday, we'll continue with our first IUI.

I've been seeing a dietitian/fitness instructor who knows about my fertility problems (don't easily get pregnant and when I do, I miscarry - no determined cause) and she planned me a workout plan and a healthy diet to follow. The first month, I noticed that i got my period on day 28, which is quite impressive for me, considering I usually have a 32'ish cycle. But then I noticed that I was ovulating earlier than usual: in February, I ovulated at day 13, so I began progesterone on day 17 (I easily spot so my RE recommended me 100mg of progesterone until day 28) and I got my period on day 28th. This month, I began testing my ovulation around day 10 and turns out my test was quite dark, almost positive, so I thought \"I guess I'll ovulate really soon!\" but I'm now on day 17 and my tests never got darker: they just got lighter and lighter. On day 13, I began spotting and it hasn't stopped. I'm so mad at my body for being so... confused! I read about how it's not recommended to do intense workouts but seriously, I didn't think it was that intense: 20 min max of walk/jog intervals and then some light weight lifting, that's it! I thought i was helping my body by being more active but I'm starting to feel like I'm making my situation worst. I'm not even sure if I ovulated and if so, day 9-10 ovulation isn't a good thing! \n\nAnyone has an idea of what's going on?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My workout makes things..worst??", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4akxxu/my_workout_makes_thingsworst/"}, {"author": "TinyRibblet", "author_created_utc": 1403550158, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_h3oiz", "created_utc": 1458089977, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4algku/long_cycles_1st_round_clomid_blood_tests_nurse/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4algku", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4algku/long_cycles_1st_round_clomid_blood_tests_nurse/", "retrieved_on": 1463473893, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "The title I know.. A lot going on.\n\n\nFirst time posting, so here it goes. I've always had debilitating cramps and long irregular cycles (i.e. 35, 40, 54, 30, 24, 60). My cramps have gotten worse than they used to be and my husband and I have been trying for a few months to get pregnant, so I thought it was time to enlist the help of my new OB/GYN. Just so happens I had an appointment on Day 3 of my cycle and decided to start a round of Clomid. \n\nClomid: Days 3-7; 50mg/day \n\nEstrogen: Days 8-12; 2mg 2x/day\n\nMucinex: Days 5-15\n\n\n\nThe plan was to hopefully ovulate at the \"normal\" time for most women and do a progesterone blood test on Day 21. Day 21 was yesterday for me and I did the blood test as planned. However, I've been doing the Clearblue OKP tests daily and have gotten negative results... UNTIL TODAY. DAY 22, the day after I did a blood test.\n\n\n\nHere's my logic:\n\n- If normal-cycle'd people ovulate Days 12-16, and they test your progesterone Day 21.... That potential 5-9 period in between is important in some aspect. Right? \n\n\n\n- Being a slow/long cycle, Clomid 1st timer who got a seriously dark, positive OPK test on Day 22, I'm thinking I should get a blood test again in 5-ish days if I'm following the other formula of time which seems obvious.\n\n\n\nHere's my reality:\n\n- I call my doctor who is out of the office and speak with a nurse. \n\n- She tells me my blood tests from Day 21 are low and I'm not ovulating this month\n\n- I tell her that this is my first Clomid cycle and normally have long periods....\n\n- I also tell her that I had an extremely dark positive OPK test this morning, the day after blood work and think I should get the test done again after the same time frame selected based on the average cycle and ovulation\n\n- I get a \"I'm sorry you're not ovulating. We only do the hormone testing on Days 21 &amp; 22. Call us when you get your period or if you miss it.\"\n\n\n\nAm I crazy for thinking that I could actually be ovulating today and the blood work wouldn't show that to be true for a few days? \n\n\n\nI'm feeling a little hormonal I suppose and to make my point asked her the following:\n\n\"So you're telling me that my dark, positive opk test today is a false positive?\"\n\n*Response: Anything is possible*\n\n\n\"Since you don't think I should get blood work and that I'm not ovulating, when exactly do you think I should consider my period as 'missed'? Day 40? My average is around 40 days\"\n\n*Response: We're going to base this on a 28 day cycle. So, 28 days.*\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, maybe I just needed to vent. Maybe I'm hoping to see someone else who's had a similar discrepancy with the opinions of medical professionals. I'm new to all of this and maybe it's not possible for me to be ovulating right now. My super sore back says otherwise. Guess I'll just play the waiting game like everyone else here.\n\n\nNot to completely seem like an asshole, I must note that the nurse was very friendly and answered every question I had. Too bad I disagree. To be honest I don't even know if she was a nurse.

An ectopic pregnancy is what began our journey of infertile hell in 2009. I was so worried my little sister would be reproductivly fucked by the universe just like me that I started having my first panic attacks. \n\nShe got pregnant again within 2 months. I've had a lot of distressing and confusing feelings about the whole situation. The strongest emotion is overwhelming relief that she was so lucky. It's been a long 7 and a bit months. This is the first baby. He's the one, he is it and a bit. He came early on sunday morning. He was induced due to worries that he hadn't grown much for a few weeks and somethimg was 'off' about his abdomen. Born at 4am, phoned and hustled us all in at 10am to show him off. I felt sick on the way. I was panicking that I'd be jealous or uncontrollably upset. I smacked eyes on my sister and just cried. I was so happy for and really proud of her. My little nephy is divine. I love him so much it hurts. \nSo kinda laying in bed at 5am on monday, waiting for the alarm and she calls and my heart tries to exit my body through my mouth. Baby was taken to big metro childrens hospital 1.5 hrs away. He'd never had his bowel open, eating ok, lethargic but then he started spitting up green stuff it was all systems go - bowel obstruction. Very not good. So Dad went with baby via ambulance helicopter and our parents stayed with my sister all night long. Everyone was an emotional wreck and none of us had slept. She rang again in tears at 7am asking if I could come in and shower her, keep her company, please don't let me be alone. So I spent 7.30am til 10pm being the best sister nurse I could.  So baby and Dad are at RCH PICU and she's been without him for 3 days. Its been so awful.  In the middle of all this (because we didn't know it would happen!) I'm on Medroxyprogesterone to get my FET up and running. Come on you useless uterus! Respond! \n\nAnywho, just to add to the kinda \"let's not pull any sudden moves so our sanities don't snap\" mum asks me for a quick coffee and chat. Here it comes, I thought, the debrief, the checking in, the awkward am-i-ok. We're close but mum's a bit funny with emotional stuff. She doesn't mean it but she can be quite closed off and difficult to talk to. So ... yeah ... \n\n\"Now, I've spoken to Dad and I've been to my GP and gyno and meet with our solicitor so what I'm about to say isn't flippant. It's well researched and thought out and we don't want you guys to freak out\" \n\n* COMMENCE FREAKOUT OH FUCK ITS CANCER. I'LL HAVE TO NURSE MY BEAUTIFUL MOTHER THROUGH CANCER*\n\nSurrogacy. Seriously, like **seriously**considered this, meet a mutual friend,  older than her who did it for a neice and spent time with her discussing it in depth. My mum is kind and always there for us but she's not really a grand gestures type of gal. But, nope! She's dead serious and it's another option for us to consider.  \n\nSo that was my week. The loooooong awaited for first grandbaby came out of my sister then aged us all 20 years with worry due to medical complications. I've got feelings and emotions pouring out of every orifice whether they're due to worry, sadness, hormones, a little jealousy but more that feeling of FOMO, wrapping my head around the idea of my motner being pregnant with our child. It's been a fucking trip man. And I can't even contemplate it all with a bottle of wine cos IVF. \nIt's 3am here. I'm off for a little sit outside to try and stop my racing brain . \n\n\nSo that was this week. Update again next week? I'll probs require hospitalization due the dam breaking on my 72 day cycle hahahahaha.

The basically arrived the day after my transfer for IVF#1. We hadn't told them anything about it and they still don't know that was happening. Seriously stressful few weeks...\nFinally, on their last night last week, when I knew for sure that the cycle didn't work, we told them at dinner that we were going to have to do IVF at some point in the future. I still didn't want them to know we had just done it.\n\nMy FIL was all excited and happy, which was a bit annoying because I don't find the fact that we have no choice but to do IVF a happy thing. But I get he was just glad that we are for sure trying to have kids - I think they had given up on the grandchild thing.\nBut my MIL's reaction - ugh. At first, she was like, \"oh, so your thyroid really is a problem, huh?\" I said, no, everything is fine with me - as I'm waiting for my husband to jump in and explain that we are doing it due to MFI. He said nothing for awhile, so my MIL is still going on about my hypothyroid, and I'm getting pissed. \n\nFinally he says it's him and it's from the undescended testicle surgery he had as a child. Well, my MIL was NOT happy to hear that. She was like, \"no, that was just a small procedure you had when you were 2 or 3. Couldn't be that\". Um no, he was 10 and it's definitely that.\n She kept insisting it wasn't that and had to be an issue with me and she's getting defensive and angry. Finally  my husband got annoyed and had to say it was DEFINITELY that. Then my FIL chimes in with \"oh you could get a surrogate.\" WTF? \n\nSo I'm finally like, \"I have no problems being pregnant. We don't need a surrogate. But if this doesn't work, we could get a sperm donor  - but then the child would not be biologically (husband)'s. That is our only issue.\" \n\nAnd she finally shuts up about it and sits there mostly in silence while we finish dinner and my FiL is still annoyingly all excited.\n\nI get that she's probably sad that her \"baby\" has some kind of imperfection, but it annoys the shit out of me that they were insisting it's something wrong with me. And I'm still pissed that none of them EVER told me about the surgery - my husband told me after we got his bad SA results. It's like it is always assumed that the woman is the one that has infertility issues. \n\nOn a more positive note, just started stims yesterday for cycle #2. I'm happy I was able to do back-to-back - I feel more positive this time. I also had to change docs mid-cycle last time because mine had emergency appendix surgery. He apologized over and over to me and said he is very confident and he is going to get this to work! So his confidence is helpful.

Well I'm a total gym rat, a crossfitter. Our gym is small and I'm tight with a lot of the folks. If I miss class for a week I start getting texts. Knowing I'm not allowed to workout as soon as I start stims until sometime post-transfer I thought it best to let the owners and coaches know I'll be out for (give or take) 2 months. I didn't think it was fair to leave it as some mysterious \"medical thing\" so I explained what's going on. I have had to explain and answer some questions because they simply don't understand what ivf entails but everyone has been **great.** \n\nA big group of us went out for dinner the other night and one coach was teasing I only have a month to live so I might as well get my drink on. Another friend (a nurse) offered to do my trigger shot if I bring her brownies (might take her up on that!). All in all everyone's just excited there's a chance of me getting pregnant. \n\nI think largely it went well because I'm a pretty open book person. I also don't over think their reactions. I could be pissed that we're forced to do IVF and I could be pissed no one know what that really means or that they're joking about what might be one of the worst/hardest things I've dealt with in life. But fuck... Why do that to them or myself? I'm excited to have a chance at a kid. They're excited for me. And frankly all of this will be so much easier by not feeling like I have to hide anything. I'll need support (husband is traveling during my stims...) and they're looking forward to me coming and hanging out at the gym even if I can't work out (I'm self employed so the gym is my only human interaction often). And if it is a success they need to know both as coaches and friends, and if it fails I'll need someone to help pick up the pieces and get my mind else where til we try again. I'm so thankful I have all these friends and that they know what's up.\n\nWell shit this was supposed to be a \"not all people suck\" post and I kind of got side tracked there. \n**tl:dr** Not all people suck or have shitty reactions to you dealing with infertility.

It was hard for me to find first-hand information about the MVA, and most information I did find was kind of fear-mongering from people who had gone through a D&amp;C under anesthesia and couldn't comprehend that anyone would do this while awake. I wrote up a [post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/3doxn4/my_mmc_and_experience_with_mva_an_inoffice/) after my first MVA that seemed to help provide some info to others going through it. It was great to have a procedure that didn't carry the risks of general anesthesia and sported a shorter recovery period to boot. \n\nAfter going through my second miscarriage back in October, I had another office MVA, but this time she did not remove everything. I had retained placenta which I passed 9 weeks after the MVA. This led to mild infection and after an MRI, my RE saw a band of scar tissue which would need to be removed. (AKA Asherman's, though a seemingly mild case). All this leads me to an in-office hysteroscopy.\n\nOffice Hysteroscopy: Again, I was kind of freaked out about doing this procedure while in an office setting, but I also was kind of relieved that I wouldn't have to be placed under general. I had the procedure yesterday and it was honestly kind of awesome. Here's the deal: Night before I inserted 2 tabs of misoprostol to start dilating my cervix. I also took 800mg ibuprofen and a Tylenol w/ codeine. This was the part I was most concerned with, as the contractions I went through passing the retained tissue were pretty horrific and I wasn't eager to go through similar pain. But thankfully, I had very minor cramps and slept mostly straight through the night. The next morning, I took a Valium and 2  Tylenol w/ codeine before heading to the doctor. Once there, they gave me a shot of another anti-inflammatory and another injection of something to prevent muscles from seizing (quite important in this area I imagine). \n\nMy husband sat with me and there were 2 nurses and the doctor (the head of microsurgery at my hospital). She injected lidocaine for the cervical block, which was the only painful part, but only minor. The block was awesome and I literally felt nothing throughout the rest of the procedure. (Side note: I process novocaine and other similar medications slowly so I always request that doctors give me an additional 5 minutes after injection. One doc told me she will starting this with other patients as it makes the dilation easier). \n\nThen she dilated my cervix and inserted the hysteroscope. There was a big monitor that we both could see. It was kind of awesome. She was in there to remove scar tissue, but surprise! there were polyps too! Within  few seconds she removed the polyps with the micro scissors, and kept searching for scar tissue, which she found and removed. She explained everything I was seeing (including the openings to my fallopian tubes, which were partially blocked by the polyps) and the whole thing was over in less than 10 minutes. It was pretty satisfying to see the polyps and scar tissue get removed and then see a clear uterine cavity afterwards, especially since the polyps could possibly have been causing the miscarriages.\n\nDepending on how much is removed, some people start estrogen therapy (to encourage lining regrowth) or a balloon inserted to prevent scar tissue from reforming. I have migraine with aura and cannot take estrogen because of that. My doctor said this was fine and that many studies show that there is no clinical difference in scar regrowth with balloon or estrogen vs. doing nothing. \n\nI will be using castor oil packs and continue yoga and acupuncture to increase blood flow, but fingers crossed there will be no scar regrowth. \n\nAfter the procedure, I felt a little sore and slow. I took 2 more Tylenol w/ codeine  that day, and have continued ibuprofen today.

I began making the rounds to the family this week. Tuesday night was my parents and last night was in laws and tonight it's my husband's brother and SIL. Dreading tonight because they have a 3 month old and we are going to visit our new niece next month. Seeing everyone else's stories this week has been really nice to know I'm not alone. \n\nRoot of the reason for posting today is that I'm pretty sure both our families have offered to help us out financially with IVF if we go that route. I was already on board with IVF after our in depth 2 hour conversation with our dr about the nitty gritty details before they offered to help. My husband is not quite on board and he is steadfast that we not take money from our parents to finance it. \n\nI think his concern is more that it is invasive and \"weird\" and that we had previously said we would never go that far. I think he understands why I \"all of a sudden\" changed my mind, but I believe he had already come to terms with not having children. Right now I'm kinda leaving it alone, but how long do I let it sit before bringing it up again? \n\nI don't want to wait a year or really even 6 months to get started. I'm 29 and if we're going to do it, I want to do it now or be able to come to terms with never doing it. Also, we have other things we were thinking of spending money on in the near term- so we have the money now. It will be hard for me to support putting that money towards anything else when I know it basically means not doing IVF for at least a year to save back up. Plus we have options for $, but I feel like he's dismissing them in order to force us out of the running. \n\nBlerg! This sucks even more because we are usually on the same page about everything!

I have been following this sub for a while, but this is my first post. I wanted to vent and ask if anyone has been in a similar situation. Sorry this is so long!\n\nMy husband and I have been ttc for 16 months now without any success. I was diagnosed with PCOS and there is a polyp in my uterus, which may or may not be a problem. Also, mys husbands sperm had 0% normal morphology. Doctor #1 said this would be a huge problem, but all other doctors since have told us it doesn't have any effect whatsoever on our conceiving. I'm not sure what to think about that.\n\nAnyway, after many months of tests and not knowing what our problem is it was a relief to get the PCOS-diagnosis. Finally we got some sort of an explanation and could start working on the problem. I was prescribed Femar and progesteron, which caused me to ovulate and have a normal cycle. I didn't get pregnant from the first round though, but I wasnt't really expecting it to work out so fast. \n\nThis month (would have been the second Femar-month) I had to stop takin the medicine, because my husbands work-schedule has been crazy (up to 80 hours a week), and I didn't believe that he would find the time and energy to have sex with me when te time would be right. (I was right, he hasn't). And I'm not putting hormons into my body for nothing. This makes me extremely frustrated. Now that we finally have medicine that could help us conceive, we can't use it! Husbands work should become less stressful in abou two months, but I feel like I just can't wait that period of time doing nothing. I'm a mess and we argue a lot.\n\nLast month when I took Femar, my gyn chekced on me and told us to have sex that day (Monday) and Tuesday, because ovulation could happen on either day. We managed to have sex on Monday. On Tuesday my husband came back from work at 9 pm. He didn't feel like sex but knew what day it was and didn't flat out say no. We tried everything. I mean everything we could, but he just couldn't get it up. So no sex, and we propably missed the ovulation.\n\nThis has happened before also. And also before his workdays started being so long. He doesn't want to have sex when it's necessary and no matter what I try, he just doesn't perform. I have read a ton about infertility and how it affects on the couples sex-life. Usually the articles focus on the sex being hard on the woman. But I don't find having timed sex difficult. Actually I have enjoyed the increased amount of sex we have been having. Of course it's not always as fun, but it's never disgusting to me. Is this normal? Am I the only woman on earth who can't get his husband to bed even when he knows how important it is? Even when the doctor orders? Seriously?\n\nI feel like I'm doing all the work already. Going to the doctors, taking hormones, tracking the ovulation, cutting down this and that food and drink, takin vitamins, initiating sex at the right time. The only thing he has to do is to have sex with his wife. And he can't even do that. On top of the fact that I feel inadequate when I can't conceive, I also feel undesireable and ugly. I know it's propably the work thing and the baby-making troubles combined and nothing I have done or could do, but still I can't help how I feel. \n\nHelp, has anyone had these kind of troubles and what should I do?

Sorry it's long.\n\nMy husband is Korean and honestly believes in the effectiveness of traditional Korean/Chinese Herbal Medicine. We had agreed to try my medicine mix (Royal Jelly, Choline+Inositol, Vitamin D, CoQ10 and a Prenatal) before IVF #3 and if it's another complete failure, go to try the herbal medicine before IVF #4.\n\nWell, my period didn't come AGAIN (I hate you) so I asked my husband about getting acupuncture to maybe get the blood flowing and get back on track. He, of course, took this to mean I was willing to do the medicine early and we had a small disagreement about that. We have a long talk, decided to go to the Herbal Doctor to see what he said, but keep IVF #3 for May.\n\nSo we go to the doctor and he does his thing and says, \"Oh your condition is very bad, you will probably need to take this medicine for 5 months.\" 5 MONTHS!! I immediately started crying and got into a fight with my husband (in front of my FIL, great...) because I wanted to do IVF #3 in May, I was really looking forward to it and using it as a way to get by day by day and beat depression. He kept saying, \"It's all about your body's health! Your condition is bad, so is mine! IVF #3 won't work if your condition sucks!\" and he was right, but 5 months... Lawd.\n\nThe doctor said \"With this medicine, you won't even need IVF again!\" and I find that such bullshit, my husband is missing the sperm casing to penetrate my eggs, THAT SHIT JUST DOESN'T GROW BACK! Luckily he agreed to get another SA after his 3 month regiment is over.\n\nOf course, my FIL and MIL called me to chew me out for the fight, because \"even if it's hard, you have to relax, be patient and always smile!\" No.... I'm human, it doesn't work like that.... but alas.\n\nI started taking the herbal medicine 3 days ago, and let me tell you, IT'S BALLS BAD. Like SO bad. I have to plug my nose for like 5 minutes and take a mint/candy and not burp or the taste doesn't go away. Blah.\n\nAnyway, that's what's up with me. Looking like IVF #3 is going to be sometime in September or October cause I'm 100% sure that the herbs won't work (though my husband is convinced they will... I don't want to burst his bubble.)\n\nSo I guess I'm sticking around here for a while. I was really upset, especially because just wanting acupuncture somehow turned into no acupuncture and 5 months of gross tasting herbal drinks, but now I'm just kind of eh. Gotta do what I gotta do.

It's kind of been a whirlwind for me between family and work on top of the consult and initial meeting with the RE.\n\nFirst things first, I really like her. And more importantly, I feel like I can trust her. The front desk has been very kind and had a real 'it takes a village' atmosphere, which was really welcoming. We already had our blood drawn for the infectious disease panel, as well as a new hormone panel for me - my previous one was August 2014. \n\nMy AFC both visits (two cycles) was 18 and 16 respectively, and our RE is really pleased with that. She told me this afternoon that judging by my blood panel and the AFC results that I would need minimal ovarian stimulation, which is a win. Today my husband did a new SA, since that was from 2014 as well and I did my trial transfer/sonohysterogram. He was allowed to collect at home and bring it in. During our drive to the RE's office we joked about what we would say if he got pulled over for speeding. \"Sorry officer, I was speeding because my sperm is riding shotgun and I need to deliver it in under 1 hour\". I have really struggled to be positive about this situation and experience, so laughing about things can really keep me from being anxious and sad.\n\n I was worried about the sono and the trial transfer because there was something detected in my HSG in 2014, that they were not sure if it was a polyp or blood clot. The RE said that it must have been a clot that resolved itself, because she didn't see anything and said that there were absolutely no abnormalities. \n\nNow, it's never fun to get a catheter through your cervix, but this was much more tolerable than the HSG for me. I had no pain at all - besides the pinch of the catheter. I know this varies for everyone, but because there was no balloon on the catheter, and I didn't have to move to get the imaging - it was a much more pleasant experience for me.\n\nAll we're waiting for now is for my next cycle to begin and we officially start the process. We've opted to do the 2 \"fresh\" cycles/unlimited FET's option through AttainIVF.\n\nThere's a lot of mixed feelings about this process, but mostly I think that I feel ready. I know it's going to be hard, and I have no illusions about how we can do everything right and it can still fail. But having a chance at it at all feels like a blessing after sitting in limbo for almost 2 years. So for now I think I'll say I'm starting to feel cautiously optimistic.\n\nI hope everyone is doing well!\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update since going to the RE", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4b1iy6/update_since_going_to_the_re/"}, {"author": "diamonddog84", "author_created_utc": 1447035408, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_rv3sr", "created_utc": 1458357926, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1458413291, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4b1lz8/ivficsi_1_turned_into_a_freeze_all_cycle/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4b1lz8", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4b1lz8/ivficsi_1_turned_into_a_freeze_all_cycle/", "retrieved_on": 1463481567, "score": 8, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "We're both 30 years old and have infertility issues.

My husband has already borderline-low count that drops significantly to extremely low after a wash.  We went to a Urologist and found out my husband has a varicocele and opted to have a varicocelectomy performed.  The surgery was just last week and went great.  In the meantime, we went ahead with planning for possible IVF/ICSI for the Fall if we do not see improvements from the surgery.  \n\nWe went to our IVF orientation last month, and my clinic decided that based on my history of migraines with aura on estrogen-based birth control, it would be best to have a neuro-consult prior to doing IVF.  I am all for this, as I can handle the migraines but am scared shitless of having a stroke.  I got the call today that they had info about my neurologist appointment - an 18 MONTH WAIT.  Yes, 18 months.  My clinic admin told me to try the Neurologist office to get on a cancellation list ASAP, and if necessary call back to the clinic to make an appointment to discuss options with our RE if it really is going to be this long.   So I called the Neurologist office and the admin staff was lovely - is going to do her best to get me all the info to get on a cancellation list ASAP.  Which is great, but I feel like I have been punched in the stomach.  \n\nI'm now feeling like we need to bank on the success of this surgery if we want the chance to even try for a baby anytime soon. So keep your fingers and toes crossed for a surgery aided miracle friends...\n\n[BLARGH!] (https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/tina-fey-nerd-rage.gif?w=400&amp;h=261) \n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Vent...Another Hurdle", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4bdhae/ventanother_hurdle/"}]}
