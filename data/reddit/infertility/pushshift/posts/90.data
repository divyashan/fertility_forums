My husband and I have been battling infertility (on my end) for just short of a decade now. At first it was timed intercourse, had a missed miscarriage and was advised to do IUI. Did IUI, had an ectopic pregnancy and was advised to do IVF. Did IVF, miscarried a baby with multiple aneuploidies and had another missed miscarriage. Advised to do PGS, did so and miscarried a PGS normal baby shortly after hearing the heartbeat. Finally, advised to do lupron down regulation for 3 months for my endometriosis, did it and went into premature labor and lost my baby at just short of 21 weeks gestation. Now being advised to do a prepregnancy cerclage.\n\nMy question is when do I stop? My rational mind is screaming at me \u201cyou\u2019re obviously not meant to have children that all of this trauma just coincidentally happens to them and you\u201d, but my heart, oh my heart is so much stronger.

Some people state the known BS that there are many babies in foster care desperate for a home, then when we state that that particular rumour isn\u2019t true, they say that we could adopt an older child or one with special needs. Some nasty people online have also said that I\u2019m a selfish, privileged bitch who thinks I have the right to have my own \u2018crotch spawn\u2019. Well you know what? Yes, I do think I have a goddamn right. It is mine and my husband\u2019s bodies, it is OUR reproductive systems. We are paying for treatment with our money which WE earned. We both work, pay taxes and contribute to society. We are not harming anybody. \n\nI\u2019m not criticising adoption or those who adopt. I think those people are absolutely brilliant. We need more of them. But personally, it isn\u2019t for me. I do not possess the skillset or experience to care for a teenager with complex trauma issues or special needs. Yes, I know potentially I could give birth to a disabled baby. But I don\u2019t care what anybody says, giving birth to a special needs child and raising them from birth is not the same as adopting an older one who will have many trauma issues. Then there\u2019s also those who think I\u2019ll just be able to walk into an adoption centre, customise my own newborn, and then walk out and raise them with no issues whatsoever. Fucking bullshit. People seem to think that all of the babies in foster care were born to teenagers who gave them up because they simply couldn\u2019t cope. The reality is that most babies in care have been forcibly removed from their families due to being affected by drug use, or at severe risk of assault and neglect. It\u2019s heartbreaking and I wish I could do something for all of these children, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to adopt one just to make myself feel better about not having my own, because that would not be good for myself or the child. I could not cope with adopting a baby knowing that they have their own mother who perhaps loves them very much, but is an addict and is unable to care for them. I also couldn\u2019t cope knowing that no matter how well I raised it and loved it as my own, the child would always have their biological family. If I adopt they can\u2019t take my child legally, but there\u2019s the potential they can emotionally. The fact that I worry about this stuff shows that I would not be adopting for the right reasons, and that\u2019s okay. \n\nI\u2019m not a privileged yuppy who\u2019s entire life has been smiles and rainbows and infertility it the only pain I\u2019ve ever experienced. I had quite a traumatic upbringing. I had an abusive mother and a stepfather for some years who molested me. It damaged me for many years. I have managed to build a life for myself with my husband in spite of that. I want to raise a child in the way I wish I had been raised. I want to do that with my own child. Maybe I\u2019m selfish, but I don\u2019t want my experience of motherhood to be on the back of a strangers drug addiction or abusive nature.  \n\nI imagine most people feel like this, but it seems like only infertile people get called out on it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16840, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Yes, I do want my own child.

I tried searching prior to posting and couldn't find much on the subject. \n\nFor context, I'm 32 my husband is 33 and we have 1 LC. Over the past year, we've had 1 12 week MMC,  and 1 5 week loss. Seeking IVF because of recurrent loss. \n\nWe've done all the normal fertility work-up/ genetic testing and they can't find anything wrong with either of us. Of course, as I'm sure everyone here knows all to well, that doesn't mean there isn't something wrong and for us, it reared it's ugly head post egg retrieval. \n\nI responded well to my first round of IVF stims and had a decent egg retrieval:\n\n10 eggs retrieved --&gt; 9 fertilized --&gt; ***0 blastocysts***\n\nYep, zilch. We had a day 5 transfer scheduled and drove to the office only to get the bad news there. It was pretty evident this doesn't typically happen. My RE apologized and said statistically, if you have more than 4 that fertilize at least 1 makes it to blastocyst stage so they do not do a Day 3 check so as not to disturb development. Well, we fell on the wrong side of statistics.\n\nThe RE said a lot of times when embryos arrest post day 3 it's a DNA fragmentation issue. So my husband went in for the DNA fragmentation sperm analysis and we just got the call saying everything came back completely normal so that's not the issue. \n\nBasically, the plan is for me to take COq12, to make a few minor changes to my STIMS, and to do a day 3 transfer (and freeze of any excess) in the hope that I just have embryos that can't thrive outside of the uterus for too long and will do ok once transferred. \n\nObviously, I'm feeling incredibly uneasy about all of this and going through the emotionally grueling IVF process again just to get my heartbroken once more. \n\nJust wondering if anyone has experienced the same thing and can provide any insight or advice moving forward? If this happened to you did round 2 go better? Thank you!\n\n**TL;DR 7 fertilized embryos but 0 made it past day 3 to blastocysts. Not a DNA fragmentation issue.

So the next step ahead of us seems to be IVF.\n\nBut we're moving countries in 4 months. We're currently in Portugal and we're going to the UK in June. Also, I'm finishing my PhD later this year, so it'd take quite some time before things get calmer again.... \n\nWe're on the waiting list for the public health system in Portugal (but it takes an average of 2 years until treatment, so that won't work) and from what we read we can only apply for it in the UK after residing in an area for one year.\n\nSo we decided to do a private round, the question is when? In Portugal, before we move or after we've settled in the UK. \n\nI've been leaning towards Portugal as we've lived here for the past 6 years (I'm brazilian, my husband is british) and i've finally built a great support network.

I am 30 years old, have been trying for 8 months using OPKs the entire time (9 cycles in total because one month we were told to not try). The first month we tried ended in a very early miscarriage. All tests for my partner and I came out normal except for the HSG which showed one blocked tube (proximal, not hydrosalpinx). I have never had any STDs or pelvic pain, infections, etc. My periods are normal and regular, though I tend to ovulate on the later side (day 18-21). My AMH score was very high, which my RE said was a good sign because it meant I had a lot of eggs. He did not have any concerns for PCOS. My RE suggested doing clomid + IUIs and said we have a 15% chance of success. He said on our own, our chances of conceiving are 5-8% per cycle. He said if that doesn't work out we can move on to IVF, which has a much higher chance of success. I have 50% coverage for IVF, but am also thinking of leaving this job because of my commute. Any thoughts on next steps? Continue trying on our own? Try one cycle of IUI and clomid and then move on to IVF to take advantage of my current insurance? Anyone else here have one blocked tube?

My husband and I are a few months away from 4 years of trying to conceive (3 years of treatment, 2 failed IUIs) and in about a month and a half, will be going through round 2 of IVF for MFI. \n\nWe were supposed to do this round in January, but it has been pushed back until April due to my husband's commitments to other things. One of those commitments, is a high school girls hockey team he coaches.   The girls have done very well this season and as a result have attended tournaments and are now headed toward the state championships. I am very proud of my husband, and he is extremely fulfilled by this position. I think working with kids, (girls in particular, because for so long he only wanted boys) has been really good for him and it's been an emotional outlet that he's needed.   When I see him interact with these young hockey players, he is so passionate and excited by the opportunity to teach them something he loves (and on top of that, they're skilled players!).   Tonight we attended a team dinner, and multiple players spoke about how much he has inspired them and changed the whole team dynamic. It was very heartwarming  to hear all of these things I know about my husband said out loud at by other people.\n\nThat behind said...It's been a source of frustration that hockey has become a priority to him.  I have compromised many times and agreed to push back our IVF date to accommodate his schedule. We had tickets to a concert that he now won't be attending because of playoffs. It's safe to say I'm bitter.  \n\nHere is where it gets sticky.  \n\nHe's an attorney by day, and works long hours. That, coupled with hockey makes it so he's sometimes not getting home until 1030pm on game nights (on non game nights, he gets home around 7pm).  Right now, that's fine with me because we spend time together once he gets home and on the weekends. \n\nI'm trying to be realistic after so much disappointment, but because I am a planner,  I need to think about what may happen if our IVF round works...it would mean that we would have a winter baby...right in the middle of hockey season. I am really struggling with the idea of him coaching next season and how his schedule will make parenting a new baby with me almost impossible...but pains me to think about asking him to give up something that brings him so much happiness... at the same time, I'm unwilling to parent a child (at least M-F) alone.  We don't have a lot of family around and I also struggle with seasonal depression...so I'm also very concerned about PPD. \n\nOne of my friends said,  'he has to quit, there's no question about it, you've given up enough, it's your turn to take control\"... that wasn't helpful and is so outside the realm of my personality... so please don't offer that suggestion. \n\nI don't want to ask him to give up something he loves... and because he's my polar opposite, if I bring this up to him, he'll tell me \"we'll figure it out, don't plan so far ahead\".   I'm trying to figure out a compromise, but I can't picture a scenario where one of us doesn't resent the other.\n\nAgain,  I'm well aware this round may not be successful and this could all be a waste of worry... but this is where my head is at right now. \n\nAny input would be appreciated, thank you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16869, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need some advice (trigger warning - optimism)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/f7mgxf/i_need_some_advice_trigger_warning_optimism/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "giveuptheghostbuster", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ll2ft70", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582344696, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/f7ncsv/im_out_guys/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f7ncsv", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/f7ncsv/im_out_guys/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1582344698, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16869, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I\u2019m Out, Guys.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/f7ncsv/im_out_guys/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "forkthisuterus", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_49hipvy0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582352587, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/f7or87/first_transfer_tomorrow_cw_optimism/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f7or87", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 22, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/f7or87/first_transfer_tomorrow_cw_optimism/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1582352593, "score": 1, "selftext": "Tomorrow is the day.

I am currently recovering but the doctor saw me for long enough afterwards to tell me that my ovaries are fine, my womb is fine, but that \u201cnot a drop of liquid went through my tubes\u201d during the surgery. She also found two little spots of endometriosis that she feels is not a big concern to my fertility. Overall I will be seeing her in a few weeks to go over our options as she felt I wasn\u2019t going to grasp everything while recovering from the anesthesia.\n\nAnd here I am now at home. I never thought I would be in this position, all my family members have had great luck getting pregnant almost immediately and for over a year I knew something was wrong since I never got even the slightest hint of a positive. All my coworkers telling me that I had to stop stressing and it would just happen, people telling me to just visualize it and it would come to me. These are people who love me, mind you, they never said these things to hurt me but now I feel betrayed and angry.\n\nI went through 7 cycles of Clomid (50mg) and I feel that the side effects were quite apparent even though it failed to make me ovulate for 3 of those cycles. Of course now I know that it would never have worked because of my tubes, so it seems like such a waste. But now I\u2019m extra worried that IVF is going to have an even bigger impact on my body and I have to say I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t have much familial support and my husband is supportive but his results came back normal and we both know this is my fault. I\u2019ve just heard so many horror stories and for the first time this is really looking like it isn\u2019t going to happen for us.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking to see if anyone could tell me about their experiences with IVF or blocked Fallopian tubes, just want to feel less alone in this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16871, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Blocked Fallopian tubes, where do I go from here?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/f7sujm/blocked_fallopian_tubes_where_do_i_go_from_here/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mmcflarg", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5ca7xde6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582385795, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/f7u256/question_about_transfer/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f7u256", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/f7u256/question_about_transfer/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1582385795, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had my retrieval on Thursday and fully expected to go back to work Friday.

My OBGYN originally wanted to start me on clomid for my next cycle. We've been trying for a year with absolutely zero results. I have lean PCOS confirmed via ultrasound and take metformin. I ovulate irregularly, usually between cycle days 19 through 28. We've been able to maintain good timing with OPKs and temping. I was super optimistic about starting clomid, and was looking forward to the start of my new cycle for WEEKS.\n\nThen my husband got his SA results back this week. Sperm concentration was 1.78 million, total motility was 12% (rapid forward progression 2.5%, slow forward progression 7%, non-progressive 2.5%, immotile 88%), and morphology was marked n/a because there were too few sperm to assess. We're devastated. He's an otherwise healthy 28 year old. No medical  issues, non-smoker, healthy BMI, works out regularly. I've mentioned to him in the past that I was concerned about his testosterone levels. His sex drive has tanked over the last few years, though I had attributed some of it due to a high stress job.\n\nHe's already scheduled with the reproductive urologist. We're cautiously optimistic. The doctor spoke with him personally, cracked some penis jokes, and told my husband very emphatically that he WILL correct the issue, it just may take 3-4 appointments to figure things out.\n\nWhen I asked my OBGYN what this meant for starting clomid and if I should postpone, she gave it some consideration before saying she thought I was okay to proceed, to give us the best possible chance right now \"on both ends.\"\n\nMy first instict was \"hell no.\" What good would it be with such a poor SA? I deleted my fertility friend app from my phone, stopped temping, and we discussed switching to NTNP until his first urology appointment.\n\nNow I'm second guessing myself. Should I give it more consideration? I'd still technically be able to start it, since I'm not yet to cycle day 5. But would it be worth the potential side effects (not to mention the buildup of hope) to proceed with clomid?

(if we end up with enough good info here maybe this could become a wiki thread?)\n\nMy history is unexplained infertility, duration 4 years. I have done 1 cycle IVF with good fertilization via ICSI, with three transfers resulting in implantation failure (no HCG detected, 1 fresh day3 SET, 1 frozen medicated day5 blast SET, and 1 frozen medicated day3 DET). Given the statistics of each individual transfer, there is about a 40% chance I am just unlucky and there is nothing else wrong. However I am unwilling to jump into another transfer cycle without at least investigating whether there could be other problems. \n\nI found these research paper on causes, diagnosis, and treatment for RIF:\n\nhttps://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12958-018-0414-2 (2018)\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510376/ (2012)\n\nWhich both cover a lot of ground. \n\nWhat tests/diagnostics should I ask about? Are there any tests you all would recommend I ask about before continuing treatment? I know this community are big advocates of ERA, which I will certainly ask my RE about.

I'll include what I've learned as someone who travels a lot, but I'm hoping folks can add in from their experiences. \n\nFlying / Airport Security\n\n* It's worth having a doctor's note printed out and handy. You'll rarely or perhaps never get asked for it in the US, but other countries like the UK definitely want to read it. I've even had the name on it matched against my passport.\n* If you are traveling with ice packs, choose hard packs over soft packs. Technically you are allowed to travel with either for medical reasons, but hard packs are farther from a liquid so you're less likely to have to have a conversation about it. \n* If you are going through a country that is more likely to need to paw everything, put all your liquid meds in separate small plastic bags to minimize that creepy experience of watching a security agent touch something you are about stick into your body.\n* Always keep all your meds and med paraphernalia in your carry-on.\n* You might as well tell security in advance that you are carrying meds, though that usually will not stop you getting searched if it's that kind of place.\n\nRefrigeration\n\n* For meds that need to be kept cold, you need a travel cooler bag, and some hard freezer packs. With [this cooler bag](https://www.miersports.com/collections/coolers-lunch-bags/products/portable-thermal-insulated-cooler-bag?variant=31266848309382) and [these four slim ice packs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FO2B5U), I've been able to travel for 20+ hours and still keep things cool enough.\n* A hotel refrigerator will likely not have a freezer, but most mid-range hotels and up will have a protocol for taking freezer items from guests and storing them in their kitchen freezers if you ask. They'll plastic bag them and give you a claim ticket. Just remember to ask for it back when you leave!\n* Don't be afraid to call places ahead about onsite options. For example, someone on here a month or so back mentioned that Disney lets you store meds in their medical center refrigerators. I've also had to negotiate in advance with the \"high priestess\" for refrigerator access in a mom-and-pop B&amp;B that didn't have any in the rooms (true story).\n\nTime Zones\n\n* Know the time differences and plan ahead. For example, if you have to take a shot within an hour and you are dealing with an 8-hour time difference, then you can take a daily shot as early as 10pm in one place and as late as 7am in the other, whereas 8pm/5am might suck more. \n* Write out a spreadsheet with the medication times day by day in your relevant time zones. This is especially important with places that are farther apart in terms of time zones because on travel days you may wind up taking two doses in a single daytime (or none), depending whether you are going into or against time. \n\nMiscellaneous\n\n* Trust your own judgement about the cleanliness of surfaces in your hotel room. I often think sheets and towels are the most guaranteed clean surfaces, so I do subcutaneous shots on the bed, and if I do need to stand, like for PIO, I waste a clean towel covering the bathroom counter.\n* I'm sure you already have an old-lady pill organizer by now, but if you don't you want one. They are especially handy while traveling, when you are out of your usual routine. I love [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y55LDZJ) because color plus I can carry the individual day containers in my purse.\n* [u/dawndilioso](https://www.reddit.com/user/dawndilioso/) changed my life with the recent pro-tip to stop filling hot water bottles from coffee makers for PIO and instead start buying single-use lower back wrap heating pads for travel.\n\nOkay!

Here's my story:\n\nRecurrent pregnancy loss/miscarriage for almost 2 yrs now. Approx. (guessing because I lost count?) 15 back to back pregnancy losses over the course of 2 yrs, ever since I took my IUD out (5/18). I get pregnant every single cycle and lose the pregnancy every single time. All were lost before 8 weeks a pre heartbeat minus a 16 week loss. Went to the IVF clinic and all of my testing has come back normal except I have an arcuate uterus. I've been tested by other docs as well. I've tried progesterone at various doses during the luteal phase just incase and that didn't work either. I really think it's my arcuate uterus (which really isn't any/much different than a subseptate uterus, except that arcuate is an intentation less than 1cm and subseptate is over). Anyhow, there's tons of research linking arcuate uterus to recurrent pregnancy loss (all of which I have printed to share with the docs I have upcoming appts. with), and how surgery DRASTICALLY IMPROVES live birth rate. Anyway, IVF guy doesn't perform surgery for arcuate uterus because he considers it a \"normal variation\" (ok yes some research agrees but a lot of other research indicates that it IS a factor in recurrent loss). He figures it's great news because I don't \"need surgery\". Yep dude... sending me away with no answers is great news! He says keep trying because there's only a 30% miscarriage rate for people with \"no issues\" like me... HELLO I HAVE 100% MISCARRIAGE RATE... 15/15 is NOT 30%! Wanted to punch him in the head but whatever just got out of there and started on the google to find doctors who DO and will surgically treat arcuate uterus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone else here with an arcuate uterus? What have you been told? Do you want corrective surgery? Have you had surgery? Some doctors believe it can contribute to recurrent loss, others don't. I, personally, believe that in my case, it probably is the issue and I REALLY WANT TO HAVE SURGERY AND GET THIS OVER WITH!!!

The last 3 years have been so exhausting that I\u2019m not sure if I am even thinking clearly.\n\nWe have been with our RE for 2.5 years. I\u2019ve always felt like our doctor is very competent and up to date with fertility research. We have however run into many issues with the office that are so frustrating. Most recently they did not send over the results from our dna fragmentation test to our urologist...after telling me they did. I wasn\u2019t even notified that the results had arrived. We feel like most of the issues are communication related. We\u2019ve had to call for beta results after hours (on 2 separate occasions), we discussed banking embryos before sending to PGT, but no one followed up and they only sent the 1 from our cycle and 1 that was already frozen. That was a $5,000 mistake. Lots of little (but really big) issues that are adding up.\n\nWe\u2019ve done 3 retrievals, 5 transfers, had 5 early losses (all around the same time), PGT with our last cycle (which ended the same way), and have nothing to show for it. Our plan was to do the dna fragmentation test, ERA, and then another retrieval because we are out of embryos. \n\nOur dna fragmentation came back normal, but the urologist did find 2 varicoceles that we can repair if we would like. I went to schedule the ERA and the nurse was so unprofessional on the phone and I had to call back the next week for clarification.\n\nWe had a second opinion today and it was just alright. Nothing bad. I just was really hoping to have a clear feeling of what direction to go in. I feel more confused! This 2nd doc suggested a different IVF protocol, no ERA, she was questionable about PGT, and to do a fresh transfer. I just don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s the answer. \n\nSo do you go with the more knowledgeable doctor or the office that has their crap together and communicates? 3rd opinion?

For the past 3-4 months, every time I have ejaculated my semen came out as watery. It was mostly water with some bits of semen, unlike the usual gluey thick white semen I have had over the last 15 years. I usually do not feel that horny but my erection and other sexually-related stuff do seem normal. \n\nI have a history of smoking, smoking-up, drinking and living quite a sedentary lifestyle. In the past few months, I had been taking Medrol (steroid) and other medications for unrelated leg pain. I did take it more than what was prescribed, 30 days instead of 15 days but the low dosage (4mg). I quitted it 2 months back.\n\nI  have also been sexually engaged with some women, with a little bit of oral. I recently gave all that up since it was all meaningless and distractive.\n\nI also did a diet experiment in which I was a carnivore for 1 month and then went to paleo for 1 year. I thought that that is what is causing the problem. I watched the documentary Game Changers on Netflix where they talked about how red meat has some hormones that inhibit the production of testosterone. When I switch to a vegan diet, my semen changed back to normal the very next day but after that, its been the same watery semen again even though I also strictly follow vegan now and quitted smoking, drinking and living quite a physically active lifestyle. I do feel stressed out since I spend a lot of time on the computer which is not natural and my work and other related activities have been quite stressful for quite some time (over 10 years). \n\nRecently, I have been feeling some warmth in my thigs sometimes which is quite unusual. I would like some advice on the issue since my prior research on the internet has revealed that it is quite irreversible and most people here talk about pregnancy which is a different issue. I just want my body to behave normally since testosterone is the precursor to a lot of other crucial bodily functions and would be getting married to build a family in the near future.  \n\nWould like some veterans to shed some light on what I am going through here. I can go see a urologist who will prescribe me some semen analysis tests and testosterone count test but I do not know if modern science has a cure for this or not. Can this problem be lifestyle-related or some asymptomatic STDs like Chlamydia/Gonorrhea? Is this a reversible condition? What should be my best course of action from here on out if modern science has no cure for this? I have recently started living a healthy lifestyle of HIIT, Yoga, meditation, fasting, and multi-vitamins but the nightfall I had today morning proved that my 2 months of focus have not yielded any results yet.
