U/S indicates that I ovulated which they will confirm when the blood test results come back.\n\nHe agrees with my old doc that probably my follicular development is out of sync with the rest of my cycle, so what we first thought were cysts may actually be follicles.\n\nHe does not agree that this means we should necessarily move to donor eggs without at least trying IVF first. He checked that we were counselled on the shitty odds, which we were, so it's not like we're going in expecting to get much, but even if we can get an egg or two we can at least try and maybe get a little more information about what's going on.\n\nSo, his plan is to suppress my ovaries with estrace (starting right now, like TODAY) and then on Day 3 we can see if everything is quiet, and if so we can then see if we can grow anything. We aren't expecting much so we won't cancel if we don't get much.\n\nOh, and after the barrage of information, he's like \"If you have any questions, you have my email address.\"  I have his email address!\n\nIt may not work, and I know that, but I cannot tell you how much better I feel that my doctor is not giving up on my decrepit ovaries without a fight.\n\nI honestly think the last doc was just humouring me with trying IVF on shitty odds without actually thinking it was worthwhile.

My doctor, a specialist, has never seen numbers quite like mine.  I have known since I was 20 years old that I would need a fertility doctor in order to conceive.  That said, I've taken a pretty level-headed approach to this whole process and while I've had disappointments, I haven't been especially worked up about my situation until today.  I am 30 years old and I have been trying to conceive for 13 months.\n\nI don't want to upset anyone: I know that other people have been trying to conceive longer than we have.  I'm not here to whine about that.  The reason I am posting today is that I am starting to have doubts about my fertility clinic and I wanted to share my experience so that people could either tell me whether it was 'normal' or not.\n\nI started TTC in May 2014... no doctors or ceremony, just went off of birth control and went at it with the hubby for a few months to see if, just maybe, my PCOS wouldn't be too much of an issue.  6 months later, I'd never had a positive ovulation test so I started going to 'the best' fertility doctor in my area.\n\nThat was in November.  I had a month + of blood tests and ultrasounds to confirm that 'yup! definitely have PCOS'.  They put me on synthroid and metformin and wanted me to be on that for 3 months before they tried to cycle me.  \n\nAt the end of March I had my 1st IUI after they cycled me with letrozole.  I had 1 pitiful follicle mature that took a solid week longer than expected to get large enough to trigger.  That IUI was unsuccessful.\n\nI was immediately cycled again with letrozole, grew 2 nice follicles, and had my 2nd IUI at the end of April.  They had me take Crinone for 2 weeks, take a home pregnancy test, and discontinue the crinone when the HPT came back negative.  They tell me to call when my period starts to start the next cycle. \n\n2 weeks later, my 'period' starts.  I go in for my routine blood work prior to starting the next cycle and my HCG beta levels are high, progesterone low.  They take a look and there is 'something' in my uterus, but it isn't doing well.  They call it a chemical pregnancy and send me home for a week to let it continue to go away.  I go back in for a blood draw a week or so later and my HCG levels have continued to rise and the 'something' is still there, but not in the way a healthy pregnancy would.  \n\nAfter a couple weeks of monitoring, they determine it's time to expel the 'something'.  I wanted to do whatever was quickest so that I could move on to my next cycle so was hoping for D&amp;C.  Instead, they gave me a shot to end it and sent me home. That was 3 weeks ago and my HCG levels are still dropping.\n\nSo here is where I am frustrated:  they need my HCG levels to be at zero before they will let me start planning the next cycle (they are down to 50 today).  I have to go back in 2 weeks for another blood draw.  BUT they won't let me start my next cycle until I 'meet with the doctor' who has no appointment available until the end of July.  From my 1st appointment with my doctor in NOVEMBER through the end of July, I will have only had 2 IUIs.  \n\nI'm frustrated because I don't think they are being considerate of timing at all.  They machine me in for blood tests then forget about me until I go back in for another blood test.  They haven't actually talked much about what the 'something' in my uterus was:  embryo?  molar pregnancy? tumor??  \"They don't know\".  They also \"don't know\" why my home pregnancy tests were all negative when my blood tests showed clear, high levels of HCG beta.\n\nI guess I'm just losing confidence in them. They are infertility specialists and yet they seem surprised by everything.  By the time I meet with my doctor at the end of July I will have been with them for 8 months and only had 2 IUIs.  Does this seem reasonable??\n\n**Edit/update:  Thanks to everyone who has shared their experiences.  It sounds like my experience is as normal as possible.

The doctor repeatedly told me how lucky I was that I was not pregnant yet and would only offer me options if in 6 more months down the line I have lost a minimum of 20 lbs. She looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if I would ever get any drugs to help with ovulation and stated that metformin was my fertility drug. Just looking at research online, it seems that metformin alone has very low success rates in helping conceive. I understand that it's best to be healthy to give yourself the best chance of not only conceiving, but maintaining a healthy pregnancy, but it all felt like a slap in the face. Essentially, I came away so depressed thinking \"what right do I have to think I should get pregnant?\" I feel like the doctor would actually be irritated with me if I became pregnant at my current weight.

She keeps saying 'after this one we can let you try' and then changes her mind. \n\nI don't care about being biologically related to the kid, but it's been three years and I'm still childless. We originally planned she would go first and then me two years later, this year was my planned turn. I'm 35 in the winter. But she says it doesn't count because she hasn't had her chance yet. She says the two years of at home trying don't count because she didn't know she wasn't ovukating. She refuses to try fostering or adoption but says she wants a baby more than she wants getting pregnant. When I suggest using me she gets upset and that's even before the Clomid. We've been having this conversation for a year.\n\nI'm emotionally devastated and excaushted. Every time I bring it up to her she gets angry and says I'm not giving her a chance. So I stopped bringing it up. I just sit here, month after month, watching her sneak cigarettes and eat junk food and complain about how much she hates her straight friends for getting pregnant and whine to me to 'give her a baby' when she refuses to let me have any part beyond financial. \n\nShe doesn't work either. I work, I hate my job, she knows I hate my job, she's been off work this entire time because her job was stressful and we could afford it. It was my idea. Now that we've spent so much on treatment it's difficult to afford again, but she refuses to go back to work because she believes she'll get pregnant soon and it will be pointless. \n\ni'm sorry, I'm depressed and have no friends I can tell this to. I literally have no friends. I thought I would be a parent by now, I hate that I've wasted so much time and money on my wife and she refuses to accept any other option. Am I being a selfish person?

Believe me, I have had my share of bad times, but for now, today, I feel grateful and I wanted to share. I understand that there are times when the last thing you want to read is a positive post, so if that's the place you're in now, I don't blame you if you don't want to read this. I've been there, so I want to warn you that this post is dripping with positive thoughts. :) Do with that what you will.\n\nOur week, this week, started with a fun-filled, 3-day visit from our nephew and nieces (ages 9, 7 and 4). Sadly, the same week ended with us traveling out of state to be with a friend whose brother passed away and needed us to care for her two daughters (ages 3 and 1) while funeral arrangements were made.  For those of you keeping count, that\u2019s 5 kids in 6 days for us, a couple who currently has no children! Talk about a crash course in childcare!\n\nWe started the week having fun with family, and ended the week mourning the loss of a friend. Those two bookends can either make you crazy or help you to give thanks for all that you have.\n\nToday, I am giving thanks. \n\nI\u2019m thankful for my husband and for the opportunities I had this week to watch him nurture and play with not one, but FIVE different children. He and I managed to establish childcare routines and practice being parents in both the best of conditions, and one of the worst situations. We practiced relying on each other, interpreting toddler cues, and giving each other quiet time for cleaning or a needed break. \n\nThis week, for the first time, I am actually thankful for the time he and I have had the last 4 years struggling with infertility. I KNOW it sounds crazy\u2026but for now, it\u2019s true. \n\nI\u2019m grateful because during this time without children we find ourselves constantly assessing the successes and challenges experienced by other parents, and by watching them, we are becoming better prepared for our own parenting journey... more confident. We continually find ourselves having conversations about the relationship dynamics of our mommy/daddy friends, and how they support (or fail to support) one another while raising their children. We wonder out loud how we will be in similar situations and discuss things we might do the same or differently in their shoes.\n\nIf we were not actively trying to become parents these last few years, we almost certainly would not be taking the same detailed mental notes on what works and what doesn\u2019t. We wouldn\u2019t be making the same observations, at least not from the same \u201cplanning\u201d perspective. \n\nWe also would not have the luxury of learning (in small doses) how we work as a parenting team, followed by the luxury of post-childcare pow-wows in which we itemize our successes and opportunities for improvement. We have the time to share with each other how proud we are to have each other as supportive partners (over some quiet time and a beer). These are things as new parents, we may not have the opportunity to share or evaluate together. We are grateful to have the opportunity now.\n\nIf we had been blessed with a child nearly 4 years ago when we started this journey,  the opportunities we\u2019ve had to take notes and learn from each other and from our friend/parents might have been stifled by a crying baby, or post-partum depression, or just the chaos daily life.\n\nThis time we have, waiting for our family to grow, we\u2019re making the most of it. And our future family will be all the better for it.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Maybe we are lucky to have this time.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3b87c4/maybe_we_are_lucky_to_have_this_time/"}, {"author": "zinnia86", "author_created_utc": 1414351663, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC since Oct 2013, Unexplained/MFI, Onto IUI#2", "author_fullname": "t2_j24gn", "created_utc": 1435347685, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1435351802, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3b89nu/cervix_opening_during_tww_question/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3b89nu", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3b89nu/cervix_opening_during_tww_question/", "retrieved_on": 1440646759, "score": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Doctors and nurses drive my crazy.
