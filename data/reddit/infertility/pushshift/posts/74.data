We can call me S. I'm married to my husband going on 1 year in April of this year. Super happy and proud. We've been together for 2 years. I'm super happy and he's on board for having a baby. I convinced and showed him I really want to start a family so in July of 2018 I went off birth control.\n\nMy history \n\nSo I had my first period December of 2012 (I was 13). It was not fun painful. Stopped school for a week to cope. My mom told me that it would we weird and not consistent for the first few years. I took that as two or 3. And in that time frame I had periods on and off. They were usually super painful and bring me to my knees. My irregular periods continued on and 9 times out of 10 were super painful. They always last 7 days and the first 3 to 4 were super heavy and so fucking painful. I would spend weekends cooped up my room crying not eating and trying to breathe through the pain. My parents did not give me pain medication so I toughed it out and dreaded it. By around 15 I was worried they weren't coming in right but mom said keep track of them and let's see what happens maybe you need more time. Okay so I did. Age of 16-17 I kept great track whenever I had them (lost the app data). And by 17 I was worried. So I got a check up at 17 by my pediatrician about my periods and finally spoke up. It had been about 5 years and nothing consistent. I could go 6 months without a period it was crazy. On and off no type or rhyme or reason or pattern, fully random. Dr. Pediattician (Dr. P) said okay well let's get you some blood work and an ultrasound. I'm up. I do both. Ultrasound comes back fine blood test show a bit of increase in testosterone and that was all. Dr. P suspect I might have PCOS and said let put you on birth control. Dad said no cuz I dont want you to have sex, that's to stop babies. I tried to explain it to him but he shut me down and that was the end of that. 5 months into dating my husband I see Dr. P at age 18 and ask for birth controls. She give to me and says take it on the first Sunday of last day or period (something like that). Husband and I stop using condoms around this time and use pull out method. Now when I met my husband in Jan i had my period 3 times in a 4 month time frame (till April). No period May. I'm chill. No period June. I think I'm  pregnant  take a test or two and negative. No period in July. Negative test again. August my period come randomly. Not pregnant and I was okay. I always wanted a family but was still a bit early in our relationship so it wasnt the right time. I get on birth control called Sprintec \n\n(Please note from the time a met my husband till now I've been gaini ng weight. My whole fault I'm lazy and love junk food. Went from 120 to 200 lbs in the span of about 1 1/2 to 2 years)\n\nNow for the recent stuff. I took Sprintec from Aug 2017 till early July 2018. Almost 1 whole year. By this time me and hubby are married and we had decided to start trying. I have my last period on birth control and we start doing the dirty like crazy. I test lasted July and early August and lasted August and nothing and I'm waiting on a period. Nothing. So I'm confused. September rolls around and wont lie we lost steam. I've been worried about this for awhile I've always wanted my own family and I want lots of kids so I'm starting to freak. Over analysis of symptoms thinking in pregnant all the time. So finally my husband knows my history and goes just see my PCP ( primary care physican) or some MD if you're so worried. So I do. I make an appointment with an OBGYN. See this lady (Dr. Z) and I tell her my history she order a blood test suspects PCOS and tells me to eat better and that will solve all my problems. She also gives me a perception on progesterone (dont remember if it had a specific name) and says take this and take some prenatal vitamins as well. I have to get all my vitamins and minerals and keep my insulin in check. Stop all carbs and stay away from sugar line the plague. So I do and try hard. I stood bringing juice to work and drink water and I cut back a whole bunch of crap no more soda only 1 glass of homemade koolaid with 2 cups of sugars. I try damn hard to stop everything. She said no processed foods and try to change everything. The progesterone I take for 5 days then after stopping for about 9 days I get a period. OMG, I got one. So it comes and it's the weirdest period ever. I'm bleeding on and off it last about 6 days and just overall a mess. I bleed most in the beginning like the 1st 2 days the sputter the last days through. It even stopped for a day then started back up for a second and then finally is done. So Dr. Z says my blood work came back with not enough certain vitamins need more of some stuff. I cant remember I'm sorry but it wasn super unusal. She says then that I should get back on birth control fix my diet and try to get off of it when my diet is good and I'm working well. In upset. We are in late October, Early Novmeber and it's been some time (please note as well I'm inpatient so this I do blame on myself)  I didnt want to go back on birth control at all (still dont honesty how would that help me). I felt like she didnt listen to my past history and blamed everything on my weight gain. Which cant explain all my problems can it? What about my history of irregularities? I dropped Dr.Z. And in December 2018 I seen my husband PCP (Dr.V). He listened and seemed to agree it probably wasnt my weight. So he says let's order another ultrasound (from when I was 17 to check how things are) and I also asked for my testosterone checked and I belive he did my thyroid as well. So I get that done in Jan 2019. Ultrasound is normal again all clear and looks healthy. Blood work come back. Testosterone was normal levels. I had his cholesterol and something else and they told me cut back in fatty and fired foods (fair statement).  Also note at this time dark veins on my hips and back of leg began to show up. Thought they were vericose vein by Dr. V said no. I did note I had a lot of them and referred me to a endocrinologist. I dont have the time or money with me moving houses and will kiss my april 12th appointment but want to see the lady.\n\nSo finally! My questions!\nWhat is causing my periods to stop and not happen? Us it PCOS? Could it really be my weight with my history? The progestrone is the only thing to give me period besides birth control should I try those creams? What is wrong with me? I'm 20 and idk why I cabrio even get a period. Like I need a place to start. Should I go straight for invitro and hormone treatment. Was my first obgyn right? Wilk my diet solve all my problems?? I want to start a family so bad and it sucks. I see all these young people my age or who had kids my age who had accident babies and the minute I really want one I cant. Why cant I have a baby? What's wrong with me. what have i done wrong in my life? Do i have endometriosis or uterine fibroids with the painful usually heavy periods?? Any help? advice? What would you do? I kinda just wanna go for it and do IVF and take the money lost and have the baby I want. \n\nThank you for reading this. \n-S", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12034, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "20 yo with infertility and so many questions.

I\u2019m posting it because it happened to me and I can find very very scarce mentions of this anywhere online, and it was terrible, and I think people should be aware.\n\nI had my second IUI yesterday. My first IUI was a piece of cake. No issues whatsoever.\n\nDuring the procedure yesterday, I knew something was wrong. When she injected the semen through the catheter, I immediately saw stars.\n\nShe cleaned up and told me to lay there, and she started talking to my SO. I started sweating and the pain was rising fairly quickly. I felt short of breath and nauseous. I told the nurse, something isn\u2019t right, I feel like I\u2019m gonna vomit or faint. \n\nShe sat me up and gave me Tylenol, and suddenly my pain was 10/10. I felt like I was giving birth. My uterus was contracting so badly I couldn\u2019t focus and I felt blacked out.  I said to my SO, something isn\u2019t right , I\u2019m not okay. I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m gonna pass out.\n\nThe entire clinic came in. My BP was 165/101. My heart rate was 133. I was in and out of being able to see straight. My pain felt worse than 10/10. It felt like a vise was twisting my insides. My oxygen level tanked. I jus kept saying \u201cstop fucking talking to me, I can\u2019t focus, don\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\nIt was 15 minutes in that my doctor made a comment that sometimes the sperm isn\u2019t washed correctly, and then you risk placing a SHIT LOAD of prostaglandins directly into the uterus. He said it\u2019s incredibly rare. But here we were.\n\nProstaglandin suppositories are given to women to induce labor. PGs are found in semen, but when you have normal sex, by the time it\u2019s reached your insides, your body has leveled it out so that the PGs don\u2019t wreak havoc.\n\nSo basically, the semen sample was chock full of prostaglandins, and caused me massive uterine contractions. I have endometriosis and I can honestly say I have never experienced pain at this level. I feel incredibly traumatized. \n\nA nurse gave me an IM shot in my ass, of Toradol, which suppresses PG activity, and after 45 minutes I was okay again. \n\nI guess I just want to raise awareness because you never hear about this, and if anyone\u2019s gone through this, you\u2019re not alone. It was the worst experience of my life and I am now terrified to ever do IUI  again. \n\nHas anyone else had this? I know it\u2019s so so rare, but maybe someone out there had this horrible experience, too.

I need a little advice from people in the TTC community who have been doing this longer than I have. I actually work in healthcare, in pediatrics, so gyn is not my expertise, but my OB (who I see at work) treats me more like a colleague than a patient, which warps things in our conversations. If I asked her for clomid, she would give it to me, and I'm just not sure if I should or not go for it at this point. She mentioned it, and seemed surprised when I said I didn't want to do it just yet. Perspectives appreciated!! :)\n\nI got diagnosed as a teen with what i call PCOS lite. Horrible, heavy, painful irregular periods, absolutely horrific acne, hair growth, just awful. Cysts were never found, but my labs were super out of whack (all I remember now was that my testosterone was approaching 200 - my endocrinologist was horrified) and I got through the next decade or so with OCPs (which did nothing for my symptoms whatsoever, but made me lose hair) and then finally a combination of 1500mg metformin and 100mg aldactone which made a huge difference and helped with all my problems.\n\nMy body seems to have regulated itself out at least a little bit over the years. For a variety of reasons (mostly GI related - TMI) I basically stopped taking the metformin a few years ago. I still mostly got my periods every 35-45 days but I have never been able to confirm that I actually successfully ovulate.\n\nWe've been TTC for a few months now. I've been on metformin again (1000mg, still unpleasant but tolerable) and got surprisingly normal labs. FSH 3.5, LH 5.something, testosterone was only about 55, etc. I've been peeing on ovulation sticks for a couple months now and still haven't gotten a clear positive result, even though i have gotten my usual irregular periods. I see so called changes in cervical position and mucous and opening that sort of correlate with expected hormonal changes during a cycle - but also never have had clear EWCM (egg white cervical mucus) either. We have sex basically every two days, and no dice. I don't know what to do! My ob would give me clomid if I asked, but I dont know if I should wait longer, and due to various life circumstances (which my ob is also aware of and totally understands) it is sort of important that I do get pregnant in the next six months, or i would have to stop trying all together for about a year.

I don't know my FSH/AMH but in general I do know for my age (28F) I have very little follicles, and Mr. Artichoke has a low count (\\~10 mil total, \\~2mil post-wash) with each SA. My RE did genetic testing on Mr. Artichoke which came back all clear. I do ovulate naturally with a normal cycle 27-28 days. I've temped and used OPKs most of my cycles the last 2+ years. My doc said this did not give him any reason to believe we couldn't get pregnant naturally (so WTF why isn't it happening!?) which is why I'm now posting here.\n\nI've never been on birth control (outside of condoms). It's also worth noting that I have had previous partners where I was not trying/not preventing and they both went on to have kids with their current partners. \n\n* **1st IUI cycle** \\- was given 7.5mg letrozole CD5-9. I had 4 mature follicles and they canceled my IUI because of risk of multiples.\n* **2nd IUI cycle** \\- was given 2.5mg letrozole CD5-9. I had 1 mature follicle. Triggered with Ovidrel and IUI 36 hours later. SA had 2mil post-wash \\~65% motility. Took progesterone suppositories. After beta showed success, they told me to stop progesterone. Resulted in a CP and miscarried 5w5d (2 days after I stopped progesterone).\n* **3rd IUI cycle** \\- was given 2.5mg letrozole CD3-7. I had 2 mature follicles. CD11 monitoring was painful, my right ovary had trapped fluid and blood around it which really freaked out the ultrasound tech. Doctor wasn't concerned and just thought I had ovulated (causing the fluid), bloodwork showed I had NOT ovulated and so they continued with my cycle. Next day, the fluid was gone and no more pain. No trigger, I went on to ovulate naturally. SA had 2mil post-wash \\~64% motility. Took progesterone suppositories. Failed cycle.\n* **4th IUI cycle** \\- was given 2.5mg letrozole CD3-7. I had 3 mature follicles. Triggered with Ovidrel and IUI 22 hours later. SA had 2mil post-wash \\~85% motility. Took progesterone suppositories. Failed cycle.\n\nI'm going to meet with my RE again in the next week or so to basically ask him WTF he thinks is going on. I want to push for further testing before doing another IUI. I'm doing IVF later this year (September) and can only do 1 round because of funding, so I want to do as much testing and preparation to maximize my chances. Here is what I plan to ask about:\n\n* DNA Fragmentation - yes, we have a low \n* MTHFR/Genetic Testing on myself - My niece was born with lip tie which required surgery and I've read that could be related to MTHFR. I have a feeling I might have genetic issues considering I've never had a pregnancy outside of 1 CP.\n* Endometriosis - I saw a doctor a few years ago for infertility (before I met my RE) who said I probably have endo based on my history of occasional painful periods/infertility. I felt like this was just a \"convenient\" diagnosis to get me out of their office, but after the trapped fluid from my 3rd IUI cycle I'm re-considering it. My aunt also has a history of endo which required 2 surgeries. I've also had on/off pain around my right ovary the last 4-5 cycles. I know that a lap is the only sure-way to diagnosis this, but is it worth pursuing? Should I ask for a lap before IVF? \n\nThoughts? Anything else I should be asking about? When we do go on to IVF, I am 100% on board with doing ICSI and PGS testing.

That following Thursday another RE in the practice did my follicle check and could not locate the 10mm follicle. She just saw 2 small follicles. Now today (Sunday) at my follicle check, the 10mm was gone and only a 6mm follicle was seen. So is it possible that what was seen on Tuesday was not a 10mm follicle? How could a follicle die in the span of stimming from Tuesday to Thursday? \n\nI\u2019m 39, diagnosed with POI/POF two years ago, high FSH (40s-60s), low AMH (0.11). Husband has no issues and is 36. This is my 2nd round of IVF (1st protocol resulted in no eggs in the follicles upon retrieval). I\u2019m looking for some protocol suggestions (Not entertaining donor eggs/embryos). \n\nCould the Menopur have caused the follicle to die? I\u2019ve read on several forums that Menopur and already naturally high levels of FSH don\u2019t mix. Thanks.

The last time I saw them, I was pregnant with my soon-to-be third loss. Right after that loss, they told me they were expecting. They then had the child a couple days after I learned I'd have to use donor eggs (3 failed IVF cycles later). To say the whole thing has been painful is obviously an understatement. He is my only brother, younger brother too, and he didn't even know his wife yet when husband and I started trying.\n\nI've felt tremendous guilt about not seeing him or doing much to acknowledge his child (my therapist said it was totally fine, but still). It was also bothering my husband that we hadn't visited them (again, therapist said it was up to me to call the shots, but still). I would email brother every 6 months with another sad update on us, he's a sensitive person so he totally got it. Seeing as we are now in a holding pattern waiting for our cycle with our 2nd egg donor (ugh), I could see a possibility of us flying out for like, a day, to see the child.\n\nI was a bit of a wreck leading up to it and afraid to feel that crushing pain (we've seen BIL + SIL's child 3 times now and each time it was like I was dying and my heart was being pulled out of my chest). The good news is this time it felt different, not the crushing grief. I held it together and didn't bawl or clam up like a weirdo, I was able to be almost normal. Just like a very sad quiet version of myself. This time it was more of like a stomach ache of bottomless longing. She was really beautiful. I didn't touch her or hold her. I felt an overwhelming urge to steal her and make her mine. She has more of my biology than any future children I have, if I'm even lucky enough to have any. It was just so fucking heartbreaking. SIL mentioned husband and I are the only aunt and uncle (didn't realize that, what a fucking gut punch), although I can't come to terms with that title for myself. Feels like a terrible consolation prize of being a mother. Hopefully one day that will change.\n\nWe kept to our plan for visiting windows which made the trip much more manageable, I was able to run on the beach with husband twice which was good for our souls. Now I'm back at work and just really sad and empty. I'm glad we did it, we need to do it.

I have a diagnosis of PCOS and my husband has slight MFI. \n\nI\u2019m at the stage now where I just want to move on to IVF. We\u2019re throwing away money doing things such as IUIs and more and more meds. I can\u2019t stand it. It s been 3 years of this. I just want a doctor to do all the work for us now.\n\nRecently I began looking into \u2018overseas\u2019 IVF. Mainly a clinic in Prague. \nThey boast a 65% success rate \u2018per cycle\u2019 and the cost of the entire one cycle package is \u20ac2,300 (they include meds with this price quote). Much cheaper than where we currently live.\n\nSo my question is, what does one cycle entail? Is it worth only doing one cycle? I\u2019m so new to looking into IVF. I know that you can sometimes get multiple embryos from one cycle of IVF, especially due to my young age, so I contacted the clinic directly and asked if the one cycle package would include the transfer of any leftover embryos also, and they told me it was a further \u20ac250 if the first embryo didn\u2019t stick and I had any left that I wanted putting in. \n\nI think there was some sort of language barrier though, and I didn\u2019t fully understand them. Would I have to pay for a second cycle of IVF, if for example I had one cycle, they managed to create 4 embryos but the one embryo that put inside of me didn\u2019t stick? Or would I only have to pay the \u20ac250 to have a second attempt using my already frozen embryos?\n\nSorry if this is rambled.

I seem to be accumulating a list of acronyms after each doctor I have been to see. I\u2019m feeling a bit lost and I\u2019m wondering if anyone can see anything in here that I could ask about or help me put my puzzle together. \n\nHistory on me:  TW\n\n* Painful periods at 13 &amp; 14 - went to doc for birth control to 'fix' that. \n* Last Depo Provera birth control shot was March of 2017 at 22 years old.\n* Cycles returned in December of 2017 &amp; we immediately starting tracking &amp; actively trying.\n* Temping &amp; tracking showed fairly irregular cycles &amp; a short luteal phase.\n* Pain with sex since stopping birth control. Figured that was just normal for me.\n* Had a hemorrhagic cyst that burst in March/April 2018. And Another in July/August, also burst.\n* Had a chemical pregnancy in May. Two positive home tests two days in a row followed by a beta less that 5.\n* Partner's first semen analysis came back \"borderline\" (24hr hold)- 20.4 million/ml, 37% motility, 23% progressive motility, 3% morphology (kruger strict).\n* Left hip pain starts. Thought I\u2019d stretched a muscle out.\n* My OBGYN suggested PCOS in September after ultrasound showed polycystic ovaries, charting showed irregularity, &amp; testosterone came back high-ish. Other more minor symptoms include some acne &amp; a small mustache. She sent me on to an RE that she recommended. \n* RE consult went well - labs for me showed low Vit. D (fixed with prescription and currently daily supp.), still elevated testosterone, and nothing else out of the ordinary. Ordered an HSG &amp; Saline sono. HSG showed open tubes (horribly painful). Saline sono showed no issues (even more painful than HSG - 10/10 pain).\n* Partner's second SA was a little better (48hr hold) - 31 million/ML, 57% motility, 57% progressive, 2% morphology.\n* Oct 2018 - RE recommends IUI with letrozole OR IVF and gave me stats for each. I asked about metformin, she said since I don\u2019t have insulin resistance with my PCOS, it likely wouldn\u2019t help me. \n* Did Natera carrier screening test after RE gave us the option. I carry none of the things they tested for. \n* Painful sex continues, hip pain worsens. Pain with bowel movements, especially around ovulation &amp; periods has worsened. \n* Decided to go to a local OBGYN office for IUI because they could do it for 225 plus meds with ultrasounds for $100 ea. RE wanted 1200 plus meds. So we figured it was worth a try at this new place, heard great things. \n* First cycle at OBGYN - took letrozole CD 8-13 because first consult was CD 8 &amp; they said since I hadn\u2019t ovulated, I could still start. Ovulated on day 14 - too soon, missed opportunity for IUI, oral progesterone 7DPO onwards. \n* 2nd cycle - Letrozole CD 3-7, estrogen gel CD 13-20 (to build lining?), IUI, PIO shot 7 DPO, oral progesterone DPO 3-11.\n* Fertility nurse at this office recommends looking into a lap if IUI fails (it did).\n* 3rd cycle - Letrozole CD 3-7, estrogen gel CD 13-20, No IUI (decided not worth the money), oral progesterone. \n* Letrozole 2.5mg is working really well for me &amp; produces nice follicles. Also brings ovulation to around day 13 or 14 rather that 18-25+. \n* Consult with endo specialist about lap was last week. It was great and he spoke with me for over an hour &amp; did a quick exam. Found him on Nancy\u2019s Nook &amp; read everything I could on his reviews &amp; such. He recommended a lap to excise the possible endo (no ablation), flush tubes again, do an endometrial scratch, check for interstitial cystitis &amp; adenomyosis, &amp; remove appendix. Suspects bowel involvement due to pain with bowel movements and he is doing an ultrasound with bowel prep in June to be as prepared as possible before the surgery. \n* Surgery scheduled for October, hoping to move up the waitlist. Put me on Metformin, told me to not use Letrozole for a few cycles to see how the Metformin goes by itself. Also asked me to do a class about charting cervical mucus next weekend\u2026? Ok, can do. \n* Lastly - he tested me for the MTFHR mutation and I am positive for compound heterozygous MTFHR C677T. Cue - what do I do with this info. \n* I\u2019ve been on low dose aspirin for 6 months anyway - will continue this. Ordered methylated folate today. 1mg/day.\n* Continuing - regular prenatal, B complex, myo-inositol, &amp; C0Q10 ubiquinol. Adding B6 slow release at his suggestion as well. \n\nSo now I've got all these acronyms and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a bigger picture that I\u2019m missing. How important is this MTFHR thing? Should I have any other tests done in conclusion with that? (I read something about homocysteine) Does any of this connect to each other (PCOS - Endo - MTFHR - Short luteal phase without progesterone support - thin lining - etc etc). \n\nI just don\u2019t know who to ask this to either. The RE that I currently can\u2019t afford and haven\u2019t had anything done with in months? The OBGYN clinic who was really only doing my IUI\u2019s? This new OBGYN/endo specialist who I\u2019ll see again before surgery? I just wish I could put this all together somehow. \n\nIf you have read through all of this - thank you. If you have any suggestions on what I can ask next, please feel free to let me know. I feel lost, but also like I have a lot of information - just need to organize it.

I hope it's okay to post this here but I need some advice from the only people in the know. \n\nI'm 34, been trying to conceive for 3 years. In January 18 I was diagnosed with a tumour on my pituitary gland- been causing havoc on my hormones. I'm on meds and my hormones returned to normal within a month. \n\nBefore the above diagnosis I had the usual ultra sounds of my womb, tubes etc. I had to go back twice because they thought they saw a polyp. Then they decided that there wasn't one. \n\nDoctors now think there I something else effecting my fertility so back to round 2 of fertility tests before I can be refered to a clinic- I have had the same 2 ultrasounds again, essentially they found the polyp from where they thought there was one before- 2cm long. Basically they confirmed that they had probably missed it. I sort of left in a jolly English way but as soon as I got outside I burst onto tears. The past 18 months of trying and worrying about stupid temperatures seems to have been a complete waste of time when I don't have time. I feel so frustrated with it all. \n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading.

Since there are always a lot of questions about RI, and not a lot of current information, I figured I'd start a stand-alone thread instead of taking it to the dailies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we met the RPL specialist in October, he recommended the RI. There are about 4-5 that everyone talks about, but this is the one who he recommended. My previous RE, who I still consult for second opinions, noted that they don't support RI because the science isn't there yet, said that they've successfully worked with one in the San Francisco Bay Area. We were scheduled for a consult back in December, but decided to reschedule it and see if another FET worked. It didn't, so we set up a new appointment in the beginning of March.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe initial consult was about two hours, and he went over my health history. From an initial view, I had some of the markers of PCOS, but not high levels enough for an official diagnosis. He ordered a re-do of those tests, as well as a two-hour glucose, and expanded thrombophilia and autoimmune panels. He ordered a new sperm DNA fragmentation test for my husband, as well as a culture of semen to determine if there were any bacteria that might be causing problems. We also did a Gene Matching test. The follow-up was scheduled for three weeks later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe follow-up was a little over an hour, and he spent about 10 minutes reviewing my history (more for him than for me, since I know my reproductive history by heart). Then the next 30 minutes was going over the new lab results, and the final 30 was developing the protocol. He did a great job of explaining WHY he was recommending these things and not just prescribing them. The best thing he said was, \"it's never unexplained. It's only unexplained because no one's tested for the right thing.\" At the same time, you can spend a lot of time and money grabbing at straws that may not give you what you want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral sources said that he would find SOMETHING autoimmune to treat, and that was totally the case. I don't have a copy of the test results, but I've asked for one so I can provide exactly what was tested and how my levels actually fit into the ranges. What he described for the most part was not a surprise for those who have read about RI--Lovenox, prednisone, intralipids, and an antihistamine protocol. He's recommending IVIG for me, which I am skeptical about because of the cost (a minimum of $3,000 and since the FDA doesn't cover it for infertility, we're on our own), and there doesn't seem to be a lot of proof that it works. He definitively diagnosed me with PCOS, and I'll be taking Metformin for that. I have a family history of diabetes and a borderline A1C level so I suspected that Metformin would be in my future at some point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo right now, I'm still torn. With the exception of the IVIG, the medications are affordable and/or over the counter and there are minimal side effects. Most of what he recommended I'm either already taking (Vitamin D, prenatal) or have in the past (baby aspirin, Claritin, probiotics, prednisone). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I went to a reproductive immunologist and got some potential answers as to why my husband and I can't easily spark or sustain a pregnancy. I'm still skeptical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12110, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Date with the Reproductive Immunologist", "updated_utc": 1554346804, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/b671yo/a_date_with_the_reproductive_immunologist/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "cocoengineer123", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14dv51", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1553709970, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/b67ivy/slow_embryos/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b67ivy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/b67ivy/slow_embryos/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1553709971, "score": 5, "selftext": "We had 15 mature eggs retrieved on Monday.

Third, to break the tie, was 60 million concentration, 150.1 million total and a 2% morphology, again all heads.

I live in the US and we have insurance (a PPO) but our insurance absolutely does not cover anything fertility/infertility related. I have been going to a large fertility clinic that does all its own labs in house. On the very slight chance that my insurance might cover some labs if they were run through their preferred lab, Quest, I have been having most of my bloodwork done at Quest. I have also been sending in claims for every. single. bill. that I have received throughout this process. I've partially been doing it out of spite, just to create more paperwork for the insurance company that won't cover my medical condition. \n\nToday I found out that even though we have been self-pay, they have been giving us the PPO discount on all the bloodwork we've run through Quest. That has saved us over $1300 so far.

I guess I was a little blindsided to learn we could go straight to the big guns.\n\nOn the other hand, this experience has really affected my mental health already, and the idea of having success faster is very appealing. Money isn't the deciding factor; the cost of IVF is scary, but we have substantial savings and can definitely afford it. IVF is so intense physically and emotionally, though... I'm almost hoping the HSG shows a blockage, so then the decision would be made for me! For what it's worth, this doc and clinic have high ratings on FertilityIQ.\n\nWhat do you all think?

(note with CW: i&amp;#39;ve been pregnant twice before, so i know things were at least open/functioning in the past - 12 years ago and 17 months ago).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thank you in advance! and apologies for not being active lately. i just can&amp;#39;t anymore. i think of you all often and i check in now and then, but if i post i just come back obsessively to see if there&amp;#39;s been any action. it&amp;#39;s been much better for me emotionally to be away, but i feel guilty coming for help being that i&amp;#39;m not contributing! i&amp;#39;m sure you understand. much love &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stilltrying", "subreddit_id": "t5_32ktv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stilltrying", "subreddit_subscribers": 3134, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "advice, please? if you had OPK+, would you BD today and cancel HSG tomorrow?", "ups": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stilltrying/comments/b6s6a9/advice_please_if_you_had_opk_would_you_bd_today/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": null, "wls": null}], "domain": "self.stilltrying", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/b6sbp9/advice_please_if_you_had_opk_would_you_have_sex/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b6sbp9", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/b6sbp9/advice_please_if_you_had_opk_would_you_have_sex/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1553829484, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12123, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "advice, please? if you had OPK+, would you have sex today and cancel HSG tomorrow?", "updated_utc": 1554429182, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stilltrying/comments/b6s6a9/advice_please_if_you_had_opk_would_you_bd_today/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "LinearBeetle", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "very low AMH, X3 fail IUI, #1IVF = CP, IVF#2 1/19 ", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1elovhw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1553832486, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/b6srix/to_hgh_or_not_to_hgh/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b6srix", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/b6srix/to_hgh_or_not_to_hgh/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1553832488, "score": 3, "selftext": "Heading into my last IVF cycle and trying to decide whether to try HGH.\\* My RE does not have strong feelings either way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have low low AMH, fine FSH, respond to the stimms will.
