I made Mr Pops take the day off and spend it with me at the hospital for my appointments\n\nAs a bit of history, in June I got a diagnosis which benched us while I got treatment for endometrial hyperplasia (mirena iud which was removed today) and I made it a goal to lose weight while I waited, which has hopefully Improved my prognosis when I get retested in January. Also while I waited I saw worked on getting my thyroid sorted, and looked into an IVF clinic which would be mostly covered by universal health care, who gave me a goal weight to get to before they would do treatment. As of today, I\u2019m about halfway there (35pounds down, 35 to go).\n\nThis morning I met with my regular endocrinologist who is helping with the weight loss and pregnancy preparation, she\u2019s happy with my progress, but made it very clear that I mustn\u2019t get pregnant while on these current drugs, so for the first time today I got reminded bout condoms like a teenager.\n\nThen Mr Pops and I had lunch in the hospital canteen (a hot date if I ever had one). He was great company though, it\u2019s a women\u2019s hospital, so lots and lots of pregnant women, babies and small children everywhere, and I usually go by myself so it was great to have a buddy today.\n\nAfter lunch, I had my appointment at the Reproductive Biology Unit with my fertility specialist. The main point was to have the mirena out, but as I hadn\u2019t spoken with them for 6 months and I\u2019d done lots of reading, visiting specialists and making plans, I wanted to hear her thoughts on what our next steps were. I already knew that I was in for a repeat hysteroscopy and D&amp;C in January (likely 29th) and then wait for results before we get the go ahead, assuming they are all clear I thought that we would go straight to IVF, but she was thinking that I should be able to do TI with Clomid (again, that\u2019s what made my diagnosis apparent in the first place, so I\u2019m struggling a little with that thought, although I do know it wasn\u2019t the cause, just the catalyst). As I left this appointment I was again reminded not to get pregnant, and to use condoms, it is so weird to hear when that is the exact opposite reason I am seeing you people! \n\n\nThings I need to consider:\n\n- I am taking weight loss drugs, which, along with exercise and my gastric band, are actually working, but the drugs mean that I\u2019m not allowed to get pregnant and with 35pounds to go before I\u2019m even in the \u2018overweight\u2019 BMI category, I am reluctant to stop them yet. \n\n- But if I give myself the time to lose weight, I might give the hyperplasia time to grow back, so she wants me back on the mirena if I decide to go this route, she can do this at the same time as hysteroscopy, phew, that bugger hurt last time! I\u2019m not allowed to do oral progesterone though.\n\n- I don\u2019t really want to wait any longer than I have to to get the ball rolling on ART\n\n- I don\u2019t want to put me/potential baby at risk because I don\u2019t want to wait to lose weight\n\n- I don\u2019t want to go through needless medical procedures (IVF) if I can help it\n\n- IVF is nearly free, but TI is literally only the cost of Clomid\n\n- I don\u2019t want to put off IVF if TI isn\u2019t going to work anyway, hasn\u2019t so far/Clomid was a shitshow already\n\n- I don\u2019t know what my ovary reserve is like, but I have taken an AMH test today, so I\u2019ll get that result in January so that will help with decision making\n\n- I\u2019ve asked husband to do a second SA, because his first one was fairly good, but I don\u2019t want that to be a barrier/false sense of security/if he needs to work on anything might as well do it while we\u2019re waiting anyway\n\n\nSo the FS, husband and I went through a whole lot of dependencies and what if\u2019s and maybes and have come up with the following scenarios:\n\n1. I get a bad result in January, and I can\u2019t even think about that yet because it could include the cancer-word.\n\n2. I get a good result in January, and I get to roll the dice... then what...\n\nI think I want to do the Mirena at the hysteroscopy, just so I don\u2019t have to be awake for that again, but I still need to decide TI or IVF, with all the pros and cons of each. I\u2019ve written it all out, I\u2019m sure I need to sleep on it, and I\u2019ve got time to make a decision.\n\nI just wish someone could tell me what to do and which would be safest, get me my baby soonest and look into that crystal ball for me and tell me it will be okay. I am so scared I\u2019m going to choose the wrong way. My husband is great, he first of all said it\u2019s up to me, but I told him he needs to help me make these decisions because it\u2019s both of us, both of our lives, and he is on board now, but I\u2019m still going to be doing the hard yards I think.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Decisions decisions", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7l01nx/decisions_decisions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1513762554, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7l0dk3/wednesday_active_treatment_thread/", "id": "7l0dk3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 111, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7l0dk3/wednesday_active_treatment_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1513821023, "score": 8, "selftext": "This thread is for updates and discussion on active treatment \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wednesday ACTIVE Treatment Thread", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7l0dk3/wednesday_active_treatment_thread/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1513764566, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7l0icy/wednesday_off_topic_thread/", "id": "7l0icy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 146, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7l0icy/wednesday_off_topic_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1513822163, "score": 12, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

We tried 3 cycles of Clomid with my regular OBGYN earlier this year. I had terrible side effects (OMG, I felt like I was melting) and it messed up my cycles (it made them 14-17 days long) and still no ovulation.\n\nI decided to go see an RE because I just knew something wasn't right, and she ordered a whole workup of tests to find out what was going on. After a month of testing and waiting we met with her yesterday and finally got some answers that I want to share with you guys because (1) I don't have a lot of people in my real life I can talk to about this - why is TTC a half-taboo subject!?) and (2) maybe someone else has been through this and can share some insight.\n\nI did have an HSG and SHG and thankfully, neither was painful for me. However, my tubes are completely open so that might be why the HSG didn't hurt.\n\nFirst - it turns out that my thyroid was low which can cause weight gain (check), dry skin (check), anovulatory cycles (check), so my RE put me on a low dose of levothyroxine that I will continue until the day I deliver. She also said that low thyroid function could potentially cause low IQ in baby.\n\nSecond - my uterus is full of polyps and I have mild endometriosis which she said can attribute to infertility and most likely explains my mid-cycle bleeding and painful periods. She said that since my Aunt had ovarian cancer (she passed away when I was 10), these polyps need to come out because while they are most-likely benign, there is a small chance they could be/become cancerous, in addition to them causing infertility.\n\nSo my next steps are that I will start taking the thyroid medicine now, and in January I'll have a minor surgery to remove the polyps and endometriosis. To remove the endometriosis, she'll make a small incision near my bellybutton and go in laparoscopically, and to remove the polyps she'll go in through my cervix. After I'm healed from the surgery and I've been taking the levothyroxine for a couple of months, she suggests that we go forward with IUI/clomid.\n\nSo, while I am not excited to have surgery (even though it's minor), I am relieved to have some answers and know more about what's going on. I had a feeling she was going to say \"Everything is normal! Thanks for the thousands of dollars you've just spent.

Both sides are very into becoming grandparents, and my MIL is especially grandbaby crazy. I really appreciate any general advice that would be useful to others contemplating this besides me, but if you've ever been in my shoes (MFI, straight to IVF+ICSI, Catholic parents, siblings who had statistically impossible babies after treatment, hubs and I in mid-20's \"you've got plenty of time\") I'd love your input.  \nAlso thank you in advance I literally could not have survived 2017 or the last 6 months since we got the MFI diagnosis without you lovely ladies and gentlemen!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm Coming Out!

So I have 4 sisters and one of them just announced to our family that her and her husband were expecting their first child due in May. We were thrilled for them as they had been married for 3-4 years and were finally expecting a baby. She even sent out darling announcements to family about a month and a half ago. \n\nA few weeks ago I was visiting her and another sister of mine who live in the same area. Well she told me that they had done genetic testing and were waiting to find out the results of if her baby was going to have Down Syndrome. I left home the next day and as we were getting off the airplane, she had emailed my dad that they had gotten the blood tests back and it was positive for her child having DS. \n\nMy mother was terrified she would terminate the pregnancy and honestly so was I. She mentioned to us that if the amniocentesis was positive she would terminate. Well a week went by and she texted me about something else and we started talking about how she was feeling. I then mentioned to her that my husband and I would love to adopt her baby if she was open to that. She told me she had actually thought about it and would only adopt her baby to me, she knows I could provide for the baby and I want to be a SAHM, and I also live close to our parents who want to help out too. She said she liked that idea because then she could still have some involvement in the baby life.  I was thrilled, my parents were ecstatic, and we went along thinking that this would be something to discuss when she came home for christmas with her husband. \n\nMy sister then chose to have an amniocentesis. The results take about a week and a half to get back so I kind of figured I wouldn't talk with her about adoption until she got here for christmas. However two days ago she texted me again about something else and I asked her if she had talked with her husband about adoption and how she was still feeling about it. \n\nShe replied that she was no longer comfortable with it because it would be too devastating to her, she wants to terminate so she can quickly move along with starting her family, and that it was a really shitty situation and she likened it to what I have had to go through. \n\nOMG I wanted to kill her. I chose to reply only that I understood and I loved her. I literally couldn't even right at that moment. I was out shopping and dealing with crowds and couldn't deal with it all right then. Several hours later after I got home I started reading through her texts again and started getting irate. I was furious that she says adoption would be too devastating to her but I guess abortion wouldn't..wtf?!? Also, I'm furious that she as a 35 year old woman says she wants to quickly move on to 'start her family' when THAT IS WHAT SHE HAS ALREADY DONE! They made a conscious decision to get pregnant and start a family and I guess her little baby girl isn't exactly what she wants. \n\nI'm so sick about this. One of my sisters is so furious with her she called her the other night to talk about it and she hung up on her, now one of them has threatened to not come home. Its a huge mess. And the thing that makes me the most irate is that I have now gone through 4 IVF cycles with a GC and my sister KNOWS this and here she is telling me she would rather terminate then let me adopt her DS baby girl. I'm so sad about this and mad at my sister. \n\nSorry I know this is a long rant post but as you can see this is a huge problem and my entire family is about to be here for several days and I feel like I have to get this off my chest in hopes of being able to stay calm at our family gatherings. Like I need to get my anger out here so its doesn't brew up inside me so I erupt when I am face to face with her. \n\nI don't even know what to say other than hang in there everyone this holiday season. :) Heaven knows we already have to deal with so much \n\nEDITED TO ADD: guys I have no problem with her making whatever choice she feels is best for her. I know it is her body and her and her husbands decision only. I will always love her and nothing will change that. I am merely venting about my sadness about her telling me she wanted me to adopt her baby to telling me she changed her mind.

The last year or so has been a bit of a roller coaster for my health. After getting my mirena out in January, I figured I'd wait a few months, let my body reset, and then lazily start trying to conceive. I made the rounds to my docs to let them know I'd be trying, and reviewed my active Rxes for any issues. Look at me, I thought, I am so proactive and organized! I got this! Ha.\n\nSo after kind of a crap summer, I wound up having some really severe PMS/period pain, including so much nausea that I started taking pregnancy tests. I started googling and began to suspect endo...so off to my OBGYN I went. She agreed with the endo guess, ran some prelim bloodwork, and found that my AMH was in the toilet. When the test result came in, my close friend was in labor with her first baby. Talk about a mindfuck. \n\nShe sent me, post haste, to the RE, who not only agreed with the endo assessment, but was similarly panicked by my AMH. She prescribed an onslaught of tests, but basically said she wants me to do IVF asap so that I can get on with endo treatments, which all conflict with pregnancy. \n\nI did a ton of research while simultaneously trying not to think about it too much...all the cutesy acronyms a lot of sites use are just nauseating and make me feel like even more of an outsider. I feel like because I came at this from a pelvic pain side, I kinda stumbled into the infertile camp by accident. I did find r/endo and then Nancy's Nook on Facebook, which is equal parts informative and fucking terrifying, honestly. \n\nSo, now I'm torn. In my research, I'd found that the HSG procedure sometimes increase fertility for a few months, like a transmission flush I guess. Some people seem to think that pregnancy seems to chill out endo, for a bit anyway. I seem structurally ok other than a cyst trying to eat one ovary, but we did spot a few follicles in two different cycles via ultrasound. So, I was thinking of just getting serious about timing sex to ovulation for a few months before diving headfirst into IVF, which I'm still trying to wrap my head around.  These tests are already crazy painful because of (what I assume is) endo inflammation and tension in the pelvic muscles. Like, I was shaking and crying during the sonohistogram, and they were using a petite speculum. I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed to time sex to every other day on ovulation week like they recommend. (My RE just stared at me and asked if I'd tried a different position. Jesus no way why didn't I think of that?!!?!?? ffs) \n\nAlso in my research, I've read about women with endo having more complications throughout conception, pregnancy, and delivery. Plus some days the fatigue and pain are pretty ridiculous, and I can't imagine dealing with a newborn while feeling like garbage, depending on how quickly the endo symptoms return postpartum. So now I'm leaning toward seeing a pelvic pain/endo excision specialist, possibly for surgical endo removal, but at least to remove the stupid cyst (which is apparently stimulated by estrogen, and would have to come out before any IVF attempts anyway). But major abdominal surgery = also very scary! \ud83d\ude29 waaah god I just feel like a whiner. \n\nIn the meantime...I am unashamedly pinning baby stuff on Pinterest (to a private board, because my friends are nosy AF) and buying all the cute crap I see for my friend's newborn (which means the marketers now have my info and are sending me BABY SPAM ALL DAY ERRY DAY!) \n\nSo... yeah. I'm here, and idk wtf I'm doing next, but I'm soooo not in the mood for xmas. Heheh. Thanks for listening. Glad you guys are here.

I'm infertilish and I don't know where I fit in.  I can't quite find a subreddit that fits my sitation.  I don't know if I would be stepping on toes posting here and understand that I'm not exactly in your shoes yet but not exactly the average TFAB poster either.  \n\nMy story:  I don't ovulate regularly on my own.  I've known that for a long time.  I stopped taking HBC when I was 20 and found that it had apparently masked my very irregular cycles.  When my cycles still had not regulated after 2.5 years I started testing to find out why, even before officially TTC.  I was referred to an RE who found I did not ovulate.  At that time, I had lots of antral follicles each month but none ever developed beyond that.  We did not find a cause for my anovulation as all my bloodwork was basically normal.   The RE at the time said my chances were going to be highest while I was still young and I did have success with Clomid 8.5 years ago.  I also had one MC at 8 weeks, and one CP. \n\nBoth I and my RE thought I didn't ever ovulate on my own/unmedicated but I conceived on my own in 2011 so I did at least once.  We were not using protection (total about 20 months) and I was not getting periods.  Even my doctor was surprised.\n\nFor reasons unrelated to this, I got divorced in 2011.  I was separated before even knowing that I was pregnant again.  It was the best decision I've ever made and am now happily remarried.  I'd like to have a child with my now husband which brings me here.  I have moved so can no longer see the same RE but my current OB is fantastic, knows all my history, and still believes I don't ovulate on my own, as do I.  She thinks I should not wait to try naturally at all and should immediately start with Clomid and an RE.  I also got the \"at my age\" speech, (um lady, I'm 33!), but she's got a point; if it was not easy at 23 it didn't get easier at 33.  \n\nSo that's where I am now.  I had my Mirena removed on Oct 16 and am now on CD26 of my first post Mirena cycle, no O yet.  I had my first twanding of this go-round two days ago and have an order for CD3 bloodwork.  I'm waiting on the RE referral.  \n\nAnd to get back to the original point of the post, where do I go for support?  I'm not quite fertile enough to feel totally comfortable in TFAB, although I have been posting there.  I'm just starting trying for this one, so stilltrying doesn't seem right either.  And maybe I'm a little too fertile to be here.  Like I said, I'm infertilish.  Where do I vent?

It was torture hearing grandma talk about how \u201cpeaceful and beautiful\u201d it was to hold her great-grandchild and how modern and lovely their nursery was. I wanted to die. I also feel so guilty for that because I love all of my in laws, they are such wonderful l people. But at this he same time, godammit, this particular cousin literally has everything go perfect in her life! I\u2019m just glad I wasn\u2019t there for the pregnancy announcement last Easter, not just for myself but for her own brother and sister-in-law who are in the same situation as us, because he is a stage 4 leukemia survivor who was expected to die 5 years ago (they were going to start trying the same month he was diagnosed)! I heard he had to leave the room when they announced it. Insensitive cow! \n\nAnyway, back to me. On Thursday I learned that only one embryo made it to freeze for our first IVF/ICSI and I\u2019ve been pretty depressed since then. I know it\u2019s better than zero.... but it\u2019s not very good odds either. At the beginning of my cycle I only had 7 follicles, then I jumped to 14 on my day 11 appt. I ended up stimming longer and had my retrieval on day 15, but they only retrieved 7 eggs. Apparently my estrogen never got very high, but I don\u2019t know the exact #. I was not happy, mostly because I knew from hunger games #\u2019s posted here (and because I\u2019m a statistics/math nerd) that the odds weren\u2019t good. \n\nAll wasted from anesthesia I said to my husband and the doctor \u201cso we will only end up with one....\u201d And of course, as usual in my life, I was fucking right, and no one listened to me and they treated me like I was just being a pessimist, and laughed it off, saying \u201cshe looks mad, lol\u201d (ya I\u2019m really sleepy/grumpy after anesthesia, you buttholes, I told you that I would be before the procedure, and this is as crappy as I expected.

I was also a competing athlete at the time.  I was never treated or hospitalized for this and because I was an athlete and muscular, my BMI never went below 17.  After I \"retired\" from competition my periods came back to pretty regular cycles, although I was on the pill as well and skipped my period for a long time (on purpose). When I went off the pills, my cycles were regular and I would sometimes give myself a break of a few months to have normal periods.  I am 34 now and have had regular cycles for the last two years that I have been seeking pregnancy. \n\nI am wondering if the couple years of no periods messed up my uterine lining.  I have had one early loss and one failed fresh transfer, could it be that my lining is bad from the years of no period and that is keeping me from success?  Has anyone else had this or similar?  What might be a good investigation or solution?  I have a frozen embryo but cannot do PGS because it is the only one so I don't want to waste it if I have a lining issue.

Unfortunately, last week we found out that his count is back to 0. We then decided to move forward with donor sperm (that was already our plan before we had the 800,000 count test).\n\nWe wanted to do IUI with donor sperm since I'm young and it's much cheaper. I had a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy done in November to remove a septum and Stage II endo. My RE told me at my post-op that everything else looked fine.\n\nWell, after this last test and after we decided to do dsIUI, my RE's nurse says \"he wants you to go straight to IVF because you have a tubal disease called SIN and you're at a high risk for ectopic pregnancy, plus your chances of success with IUI is now pretty low.\" I was stunned as he never mentioned this to me prior to this conversation. She said it's probably because we were planning on going straight to IVF anyways.\n\nSo now I'm stuck with the decision of should I risk dsIUI (obviously much cheaper, 2k vs 10k), or just go straight to IVF with donor sperm.

They are wonderful women.  Both are younger and both have beautiful one-year-old children.  While they were both pregnant I underwent a double-mastectomy.  When they had their babies I began chemotherapy.  It KILLED me to watch them because I was so happy for them and so sad for me.   \n\nNow my treatment is done and my husband and I are starting on our IVF journey.  We've also had a failed adoption but are actively waiting, just in case we meet an expectant mother/father who might want to choose us. \n\nI love these women dearly and they have supported me through everything, but I also feel as if I have nothing in common with them anymore.  Their world is consumed by their children and it's become the same for all the inlaws.  We went to visit for the holidays and all anyone talked about or focused on was the babies.  I love those kids and we spent hours together playing and having fun.  I loved every minute but that's ALL. WE. DID.  No one was even capable of talking about anything else.  I asked about their jobs, they answered briefly.  No one asked about mine.  I asked about their New Years plans.  They told me all about what they would be doing with the babies.  No one asked about mine.  At one point both my sister-in-laws, their husbands, and the babies all abandoned our dinner table to let the kids run around (which is fair since they are little kids at a fancy restaurant and shouldn't have to sit for hours).  I realized we were literally left alone at the table with no one talking to us. I cried. \n\nI began my doctoral program this summer as well as a new job.  I am so excited about both of them.  No one asked me about either and I was pretty crushed by this.  I even made a desperately pathetic bid to bring it up several times myself and no one asked a single thing or commented on it; just a nod and a smile.  And--irony of all ironies--my doctorate is in Early Childhood/Early Childhood Special Ed so it's *directly* related to their current focus of babies...and still no one asked.  \n\nI am so upset over my own infertility that I cannot even tell if my hurt feelings are justified.  It was such a painful weekend and I don't know how to cope.  No one is deliberately trying to be hurtful but it was a terrible weekend all the same.  I can't even manage to get my mind wrapped around what I will do when we go back for another visit.  Also, as much as I want to be a mother, I will also always love my career, and I feel they are the opposite (a job just pays the bills but family is the real goal).  When none of us had children we were at least able to talk about other things but now I am clearly on the outside looking in.  Even if/when I become a parent I know I will always be highly career-driven, it's just who I am.  \n\nI don't know how to let it go.  While I will always smile and grin for the sake of everyone else, I want to be able to cope better for my own mental well-being.  I just feel lost.  \n\nTl;Dr: Inlaws only talk about the new babies in our family and I spent the entire holiday weekend feeling ignore.  Trying to figure out how to cope.
