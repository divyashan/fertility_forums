I finally saw an RE this month, so the plan this cycle was same dose of femara (5mg CD3-7), then follicle monitoring ultrasound CD 13 (which was today). I have one 22mm follicle which I know is good and what I was hopefully expecting. Now the plan is for me to do the trigger shot at 10pm tonight and do an IUI at 10am on CD 15 (36 hours from trigger shot). What I'm wondering is if this is really any different that what I've already been trying? All signs were pointing to the fact that I was already ovulating on my own, so the point of the trigger shot is just to try to nail down the timing of ovulation/IUI a little better. But basically, the timing of what we are doing this cycle seems like exaclty what I did the last 2 cycles. Does anyone have any insight or experience as to whether I really have a better shot this time?  I know from what everybody says that the midcycle ultrasound monitoring is important, but I feel like I just paid $220 out of pocket and had a terrible time getting my work schedule arranged for an ultrasound that told me exactly what I already knew.

Painful injections, a lot of soreness, the whole nine yards. We had narrowed it down to around the time we got the new batch of syringes and needles, so we were suspecting a bad batch. Before I go on, we did notice that the bases of the 22g needles were a different color than they were before, but we figured it was just a different brand.

We have known about our infertility since 2010 but have only recently decided to go ahead with the IVF-ICSI. This is our only option to conceive (hop, skip &amp; a jump directly to IVF-ICSI do not pass go do not collect anything). We are paying out of pocket and we have to travel 5+hrs to/from the fertility center for this crap. We haven't even had our calendar appointment (scheduled for Monday) and I already feel like I've been run through the gutter and back and I'm breaking down emotionally. I want to quit and I haven't started yet. Now, I am a pretty logical and reasonable person, normally. My job is emotionally taxing and I am trained to handle stressful situations so I thought this would be a breeze. I am also very introverted and private so we haven't shared the news with many (as needed basis only). I was doing alright emotionally, until I spoke with my supervisor last week. I work for a large insurance company, with thousands of employees (this is no small mom and pop shop). I have been a very dedicated, loyal and engaged employee for the past 9 years (same department, same job). I have never taken time off for medical reasons, I don't abuse sick time, I am literally always working. I am considered a very good and experienced employee. I thought I was a valued employee. When we first started this process, in November 2015, I used personal/vacation time for the preliminary testing and initial consult. I ran out of personal time by the time my orientation appointment came around in December 2015 so I decided that it would be in my best interest to notify my supervisor about the IVF at that time. Although my supervisor is a middle-aged woman with no kids, she was initially very supportive and told me it wasn't a problem to simply 'make up' the time. I realize now the 'support' was only because I was using my own personal time. When I notified her about my next appointment (calendar apt coming up) she asked me if I was using personal or vacation time and I asked her if it would be possible to compromise and allow me to make up the time  rather than have to take personal time for a medical problem. We don't get a lot of time off for vacation and I need it in my line of work. She said my situation is different than others because I have to take full days off but she would discuss it with boss. My supervisor told me the following (which came from HR): IVF is not considered a medical sickness; it is not considered medically required and it is considered an elective surgery so the best option for me in my situation would be to work a 'flex' schedule so I could make up for the time I will be missing. Well, let's just say I didn't take this very well and I have been suffering emotionally, silently, since that conversation. It's not the flex schedule that offended me, it was everything else. I've read tons of articles about how infertility affects people and how work can be a big cause of distress but I never in a million years thought my employer would make me feel this shitty. I even asked if HR has dealt with IVF before and apparently everyone before me was too embarrassed to look into it. What a disservice to the young men and women coming into this industry.  I feel so isolated and thrown to the side. I shut down completely. I'm doing everything I can to keep afloat. This is not like me. I feel like my employer is discriminating against me. I feel tremendously exposed, isolated, unsupported and disregarded. I wish I would have kept this to myself. In this day and age how can this happen to couples dealing with infertility? The stress is causing me to drop weight - I have lost 5lbs since that ridiculous discussion. I can't afford to lose anymore weight. I can't exercise because I can't keep weight on and that's making me miserable. My husband is worried and has not idea how to help me (his employer told him to take whatever time he needs - no questions asked - fully fucking supportive). I am feeling resentful towards my husband because he is the infertile one and we need IVF+ICSI due to his infertility yet he has all the support and time off in the world and I am the one left holding the fucking bag, having to work flex hours to make up missed time. WTF? Am I the only one that thinks this is crazy? I'm angry and feel like I'm getting a real shitty deal here. I'm worried that my emotional state will not only affect my ability to conceive, but also my job. I called the fertility center this morning as the website says they offer counselling/support for couples going through IVF at their facility but I was told the services are not available to me because I am not using donor sperm!!  This threw me for another loop and I have now reached out for help through an employee assistance program available through work.  What a shit show. \n\nCan someone please throw me a fucking bone?

So, we retested my AMH and here we are with a 0.25 result.  \n\nMy RE said she doesn't think it's necessary to retest my FSH, as she's planning on increasing my gonadotropins for IVF #2 anyway, but we can if I want.  My leaning is that more info is better, but perhaps I should just let it go at this. Today is CD1, so I have to decide before CD3.  Any thoughts?

My wife and I have been trying for 2 and a half years with no luck.  About a year ago I was diagnosed with azoospermia after two semen samples with a zero count.  There were some other things like low PH and volume that I think might be trying to tell us something but so far all of the Dr's have shrugged that off.  My first urologist, after running some hormones samples etc said \"it's gene related, you should consider adoption or donor.\"  Of course, he encouraged me to get a second opinion and referred us to a specialist.  The specialist was utterly useless as he didn't even deal with MFI.  This was all early to mid 2015.  In December I decided I wanted that second opinion.  This urologist could not locate my Vas Deferens when feeling around down there.  Now, I think I can find them just fine but i'm not trained to know what i'm feeling down there.  Maybe I'm just finding veins?  In any case, he suggested a kidney ultrasound because of the commonality of CAVD (congenital absence of the vas deferens) and renal agenisis (one kidney).  Kidney ultrasound showed normal, however I don't think that fully rules out CAVD.  The other thing it is associated with is Cystic Fibrosis.  I don't have any other really bad symptoms of CF aside from the fact that MFI is a symptom.  I do have some of the things associated with it like very salty sweat so I am wondering if that test might be worthwhile.  My thought is something like that would give us a good idea of whether it's genetic or not.  If we do find it is obstructive as opposed to genetic then there's a good chance a testicullar biopsy to recover some sperm may be worth while.  \nI told my wife if the kidney ultrasound didn't turn up anything that we could move forward with the donor route so we have begun that process.\n\nI guess my reason for posting here is wondering if anyone else has followed a similar path and what the results were.

(Any people in Vancouver, BC who want his name, PM me).\n\nWe went in yesterday for our change of plan. RE says the picture is becoming much more clear. My body is getting almost ready to ovulate but not releasing the egg, and blooming giant, terrible cysts instead, which is why the letrozole just gave me a bigger cyst. He thinks my brain/ body /hormones aren't signalling properly to trigger ovulation. \n\nI am being put on birth control for 42 days to give me two months for my current, massive ovarian cyst to subside and to prevent me from growing new ones. When I get my period I have to go in for an ultrasound to check that the cyst is gone. If it isn't, they will drain it so we can get going. Then I am doing 5 mg. of letrozole, and monitoring, followed by a trigger shot and timed intercourse. Barring anything weird, we will try this for 3 months before moving on. If this doesn't work, I am feeling like it would be reasonable to skip IUI and move to IVF at that point but I am trying not to worry about that until I get to that point.\n\nSince I am out of commission for 2 months with the birth control, husband and I have booked an 11 day trip to the Yucatan in mexico for the end of Feb.

I have a history of 5 pregnancies; 1 resulting in a second trimester loss, 1 in a loss at around 8 weeks, and 3 chemical pregnancies.  \n \nI had lots of testing done over the years and the only abnormalities have been an elevated homocysteine, elevated TPO antibodies, and recently a positive ANA.  I am on synthroid.  I worked with an RE a few years ago to work up the RPL, and my (f) partner at the time and I proceeded with donor IUI which resulted in a chemical pregnancy; I went on to do a known donor fresh ICI which had the same result.  As well as a few other cycles using a bank in WA state, etc.\n \nAnyhow, long story short, after all that my partner and I split up and I am currently in a long term common-law relationship with a (m) partner.  I have had one pregnancy with him naturally, also resulting in a chemical.  To get his stats out of the way, he is mid thirties and proven fertility (strangely enough he has been a fresh/known donor for quite a few women, succesfully).  I currently have a mirena IUD for birth control (and won't be taking it out unless we make a decision based on the current labs and upcoming apt)\n \nI recently had some hormone tests run, and my FSH came back at 9.8 which I was told is significant for my age, and have subsequently made an appointment with the RE I saw previously which is later this month.  This cycle, day 3 labs were repeated (but actually run on day 5 due to scheduling/lab hours) and came back with a very normal FSH of 5.1.  My estradiol was 305 pmol/l (~85 pg/ml) which falls within lab range but apparently is a bit elevated which may result in a falsley suppressed FSH?\n \nLast month, my CD21 progesterone was also tested and 3.8 nmol/l (1.2 ng/ml)\n \nAnyhow!  On one hand I feel I am making a mountain out of a molehill and over-reacting and on the other...well, I am super stressed by the thought that beyond the unexplained recurrent pregnancy losses, I may well have another barrier in my way.  My partner and I weren't intending to TTC for another year or so, but some of that will hinge on the results of this and whether time is \"of the essence\" or ...I'm paranoid :)  \n \nOther small note is that my cycle has definitely gotten wonky in the last 2-3 years.  (both before and after IUD placement).  They range from 23-60+ day cycles.  I have not been doing BBT for this period of time, although I may for my own curiousity start to do so again.  Prior to all of this (2013 and earlier?) I had very regular cycles of 29-31 days with a predictable OV of CD14-15.  (verified by BBT, OPK's and on a few occasions progesterone testing during the luteal phase)\n \nBasically -- thoughts?  Similar stories?  Opinions?  Etc?

I do not fit into the category of infertile, but after what happened it appears I might have a serious problem now. \n\nTw: my husband and I had a stillbirth Oct. 27th at 25 weeks no cause was ever found. I had no cycle after my loss but had a positive opk and temp jump leading me to believe I ovulated December 27. But what I thought was a new pregnancy is actually a tumor causing rising hcg levels. 15DPO hcg 170 progesterone 22.7 17DPO hcg 365. 19DPO (60hrs later) hcg 960. 20dpo hcg1208. Internal ultrasound showed no gestational sac but did show a heterogeneous structure that contains multiple cystic structures no fetal pole or hb. I was then informed that they believed I had a molar pregnancy. Didn't think it could get worse but it did. \n\nWorried about my hcg being too low for a molar I went to a different hospital for another opinion today. This is that the ultrasound showed:\n\n\"The anterior body of the uterus appears thickened and asymmetric when compared to the posterior body uterus. The echogenic endometrium is asymmetrically placed posteriorly in the uterus. This suggests some thickening in the anterior body of the uterus in the sunendometrial space (2.9x2.4 cm) or perhaps thickening of the endometrium however I suspect this is thickening in the sunendometrial space. There is a small 5mm cystic structure seen in the junction of this 2.9 cm hypoechoic region and the echogenic endometrium. Appearance raises the possibility of a sunendometrial cyst and adenomyosis. It is entirely possible that this small cyst is a gestation. I cannot however confirm with certainty a 'double decidual sac sign'. No other gestational sac is seen. Within the right ovary 1.8 cm cyst is seen. Right ovary measures 3.9 cm in length. Left ovary measures 2.4 cm in length and contains a 1cm cyst. No adnexal mass or free fluid is identified. \n\nImpression: clear cut gestational sac is not seen. I favor thickening of the myometrium anterior to the endometrium which raises the possibility of adenomyosis. I do not discretely identify a gestational sac. Otherwise no significant abnormality is seen.\" \n\nWhat does this Even mean? Is it not a molar then?

When the nurse at my RE's office called to tell me about my labs, she said all was normal except my AMH was 0.96. She said they want it above 1, but mine's not too far off and not to worry about it. That was earlier this month. Today, my RE called to discuss my results, and he gave me the impression this was more worrisome. He said if I don't get pregnant this month, he wants me to do some further CD 3 labs.

This is my first post here despite lurking a long time. I honestly don't know if this is the appropriate place, but I don't think any other sub would really understand.\n\nAt 15 years old, I stopped ovulating...And at just 16 I was told that I might never have children. It's okay though! Since then I have discovered why and was very recently informed that I *SHOULD* be able to but almost certainly with a lot of assistance (I've been advised that IVF will likely be necessary). \n\nNow, for the first time in my life I'm at a point where I'm talking seriously with my SO about having children. I've had the contraceptive implant in my arm for years - not for the sake of contraception, but for its effect on my hormone levels, so I'm getting that removed soon. \n\nYet...I'm terrified. I guess when every other girl was being told about pregnancy and periods and such it was never relevant to me. I know that its about 99.9999% sure that I won't get pregnant when I take this thing out but if by some MIRACLE I do...God, I'm terrified. I want children desperately, I really do, and have thought for years that it was an impossibility.  \n\nWhy am I so conflicted? I'm excited to try for a baby, yet so utterly panicked and afraid because I feel lost. I mean, I know all about children, I've been around them my whole life and even worked with them but I never thought I'd have my own so...What in the hell am I supposed to know? \n\nI find myself stuck in what seems like the mindset of a 14 year old, scared to get pregnant. But most of all, I'm scared to try. I'm scared to face what might be years of trying and disappointment - not only to me, but to the man I love more than anything. I haven't ovulated since my early teens and yet only NOW do I feel like I'm beginning a journey of infertility. \n\nIt scares me so much that I'm crying...I'm so confused.
