I unexpectedly got contacted by them about it a few weeks ago and last week had an on-site interview. They REALLY want me and I've been told an offer is coming at the end of next week. They both gave me the more senior title that I wanted and the offer is with a group I didn't originally apply for but expressed more interest in, so they are definitely pulling out some stops.\n\nGoing back to the US, and especially to the city this job is in, has been a long-term plan of mine (I never intended to be where I am now for so long, now past 5 years). I feel like the only thing holding me back is that it interrupts my infertility treatments. Things that are good where I am now: \n\n- I'm at a point in my current job where I'm basically the boss and I can easily disappear whenever I need to for doctor appointments, work at home around appointments, plus infertility is considered a chronic disease here, so it is within my full rights to take as much sick leave as I need for it (although I've not taken much). It's also good while dealing with the stress of IF, to have relatively little stress at work vs. starting at a new place which opens up a whole new bottle of stress.\n\n- My husband is not a US citizen and he would also need to immigrate which takes time, but he could in theory visit while waiting to get his visa (if he needed to say, give a sperm sample to freeze at least) and it's likely this will only be maximum of 1-2 months apart anyway since I think we would qualify to get some expedited processing. \n\n- If I do ever succeed at the infertility treatments, I can get up to 1 year paid parental leave. But I'm getting to the point where I don't know if I can wait here forever for something that may never happen - that would now require staying here another 2+ years to take advantage of it and I don't think my husband would last here that long anyway.\n\n- After being on a long wait list, I can finally start public IVF treatments at earliest in January (you get 3 fresh IVF cycles plus all frozen embryo transfers from those cycles up to either having the first child, maxing out those cycles, or reaching age 40, for FREE minus about $600 in drugs per year). I could get in a maximum of only one fresh cycle before I would have to start the new position because they would require me to start by mid-late February. Since the public could still not have room for me in January, at worst I would have to pay about $5k for a new fresh cycle privately.\n\nI am currently waiting to hear anything about the benefits. The HR guy told me he'd send me a health care brochure (they have a choice between Kaiser and Blue Cross plans, I know no other details currently) and I told him I need the FULL plan details. He seemed a bit weirded out by that request, no idea why because I would ask for that even if I weren't undergoing infertility treatments. Glassdoor shows one person reporting they offer \"fertility assistance\", whatever that means. It's in a state with an fertility treatment mandate however the mandate uselessly explicitly excludes IVF, so I'm pretty sure there will be very minimal IVF coverage if any. This position will likely pay a good deal more than what I'm making now, net, but I have no idea if the difference would cover both the doubled cost of rent there vs where I am now, and the cost of 1 or more cycles of IVF out-of-pocket. And my husband would be unemployed when he gets there, whereas he has a decent job where we are now. However he's not too happy there and I'm not sure how long he can hold out in it. If he could get a job in the new area relatively quickly, our combined income would definitely make this a competitive choice, even with the doubled rent and paying for IVF out-of-pocket.\n\nWhat I'm totally not sure about is - could I bring this up as part of the negotiation? Has anyone done this before, ever? I think I might stand a chance with this - they seem REALLY keen on hiring me, and I feel like I don't necessarily have much to lose bringing it up, considering the non-desperation of my situation right now. Or would it just be too weird, since it would imply I may also need to take parental leave in whatever form they offer/don't offer in the near future. I would need some flexibility on the job for sure with going to all the appointments and I'm not sure it's helping anyone if I don't bring it up. Opinions?!  I'm so sooooo torn about what to do. I also may not really need IVF and would consider just doing more IUIs. They worked for me 2 out of 4 times so far, but I keep miscarrying, so I thought IVF was a reasonable next WTF step but my first one last cycle totally failed with only one blast transferred on day 5 that didn't take, and nothing good enough to freeze.\n\n**tl;dr Job offer coming with possible room to negotiate - bring up IF or not??**\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Infertility-related negotiation with new job offer?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7ch3n2/infertilityrelated_negotiation_with_new_job_offer/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1510511754, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7ch4uf/sunday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "id": "7ch4uf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 95, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7ch4uf/sunday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1510593864, "score": 7, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

Had the standard barrage of testing done. HSG showed a possible septum, so they booked a 3D ultrasound appointment. I called to book a follow up, and 2 weeks was the earliest time available (which put it a month after the 1st appointment, and into my next cycle).\n\nFriday, before the appointment we had a house inspection and didn't accounted for heavy, heavy traffic getting to the Dr's, since we didn't really know the route. I called 40 minutes before my appointment to say I was running late and was told that the doctor would know I was coming. I was half an hour late and arrived to a locked door. The was no one associated with my clinic there. Called them, and got transferred pointlessly for while, and eventually told I'd need to reschedule... at which point I melted down, and my mood has been a mess since and I really wanted to just break that stupid door.\n\nMy fertile period (probably) started yesterday. They never posted my HSG or my 3D sonogram results to my portal, so I don't know if I need surgery and should be using protection in the meantime (not that we're likely to suddenly be fertile, but maybe a month of levothyroxine has shifted the odds). The secretary called today, and was really callous about the whole thing. I asked to have the doctor call back with the results of the sonogram, and she's taking her time with that.\n\nI hate not knowing what's going on. I hate feeling like time is slipping away with nothing happening. I hate that stupid locked door. I hate that the missed appointment sapped all of the joy out of buying a house, and left all of the stress. I hate that my realtor keeps reminding us that we don't have to fix lead paint since we don't have a child under 6. I hate putting so much energy and emotion into something that remains outside my control.\n\nI'm contemplating switching doctors (within the same clinic), especially since we'll be moving in December, but I'd rather travel an hour to appointments than possibly waste another 2 cycles waiting for a first visit with someone new.\n\nGoing to let this stand as my introduction, too.

I don't really have a coherent timeline to bore you all with, but I have a MTHFR mutation (compound heterozygous), have had laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis, potentially one blocked tube (the other seemed fine), and some sort of ovulatory/luteal phase insufficiency that doesn't seem to bother the physicians I've seen, but that gives me the most problematic symptoms so far.\n\nI track my cycles myself using urinary hormone monitors/indicators, and they seem to point to me ovulating on my own most of the time. I get a strong LH surge about 5 out of 6 cycles. I've had several rounds of clomid and several of femara. I've typically had shorter or normal luteal phases (10-14 days), but I started taking progesterone at peak +3 through peak +12. I did that for a couple years and I started noticing brown bleeding starting before the progesterone, so my doc said to start the progesterone a day earlier, at peak +2. My past several cycles I've started brown bleeding at peak +2, and continuing my tail-end brown bleeding basically through my cycle when I'm not taking the progesterone.\n\nIn addition to this, we moved a few months ago from a fairly large urban area with lots of options for docs, to what I call a \"rural city\" with much more limited options. The hospitals here are the type that transfer their high-risk patients to bigger hospitals. My health insurance went from decent to poor, and I have a $7100 deductible, so I have yet to seek care out here.\n\nFor these reasons, I am hesitant to start seeing a doctor again, but because of the continued bleeding, I now feel like I have to. I know the automatic fix for bleeding is birth control, unless you're trying to conceive, and a part of me is afraid they'll make me choose between bleeding and trying.\n\nWe've decided against the more-invasive treatments such as IUI and IVF for personal reasons. I feel like mechanically, I have at least a 50% shot of doing it on our own, but hormonally may be another story. \n\nI'm a nurse but I don't know all of the fertility jargon. I know some of the things that are wrong, but I still feel like there's something missing, and I can't tell if it's because I really want an answer, or if it's because there actually is something else. \n\nHas anyone had similar experiences with brown bleeding or progesterone? I have yet to see an RE, but would it be worth it if I'm not pursuing IVF, or would we be wasting each other's time? If there's not an RE in my area, I'll have to drive at least 3 hours. \n\nIf it isn't inappropriate to ask, I'm also open to hearing about any sort of alternative treatments others have pursued, even if it's just to help with symptoms. Since I'm essentially paying out of pocket for health care, I'm trying to stay open to alternatives, especially if they're more accessible. I know I can Google things, but I'm interested to hear about others' personal experiences.\n\nThank you all in advance, and I wish everyone the best of luck in their own journeys.
