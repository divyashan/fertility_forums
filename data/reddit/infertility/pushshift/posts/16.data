Went straight to IVF four years ago because we had insurance that covered 80% of it and we were about to lose it. Failed cycle with poor embryo quality. Took a 3 year break. I have PCOS and endo. Husband had testicular cancer six years ago but his SA's have always been good. RE doesn't know why we can't get pregnant though his guess is that my PCOS could be contributing to poor egg quality, husband's sperm could have fragmented DNA, or some other random thing we haven't figured out yet. \n\nAs of now, we're scheduled for an IUI this upcoming cycle and we decided to try 2-3 IUIs since we skipped that step and they're much cheaper than IVF. However, my RE called today and said I qualify for their shared risk program but if my first cycle results in poor egg quality, we'll be disqualified and receive our money back. On one hand, we said we'd stop at IVF because we don't have the money upfront and are terrified at taking out a loan and then having to make large payments if we do get pregnant. On the other, if my egg quality is poor again, we can have peace and closure on this journey. \n\nMy two biggest fears are 1) not doing enough to have a child and wondering what if and 2) being so far in debt that I can't breathe or live an awesome child free life that compensates for my lack of progeny. \n\nI know my husband and I need to make this decision but I'd appreciate any thoughts that could give me perspective. \n\nTl;dr IVF is pricey and I don't know if I want the debt ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need perspective", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3v1odi/need_perspective/"}, {"author": "HandbagofRainbows", "author_created_utc": 1375656570, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "3IUIs, MFI & anovulation, taking a break", "author_fullname": "t2_cmnkk", "created_utc": 1449003565, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3v1s0k/what_are_the_femara_effects/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3v1s0k", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 17, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3v1s0k/what_are_the_femara_effects/", "retrieved_on": 1454886999, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I want to know if what I'm experiencing is Femara or anything else.

I stopped in a room and changed into a gown. Then they took me into the x ray room. I lay on a table with a pillow (quite comfortable all things considered) underneath the X-ray machine. My husband was allowed in the room and given an apron for the radiation. \n\nThe nurse asked for the date of my last menstrual period to confirm I have no chance of being pregnant. Then the doctor came in. He pulled me down closer to his end of the table. He was very helpful and explained every step of the process. \n\nFirst, he inserted the speculum. Then he swabbed some antiseptic on my cervix. Then he applied a local anesthetic to the cervix. I felt a mild pinch for a few seconds but that was it. Then he inserted the catheter (no pain thanks to the local anesthetic) and injected the dye. \n\nI did feel some pressure when the dye was inserted. It wasn't painful, per se, just an odd feeling. A little like menstrual cramps but not exactly. The pressure and discomfort lasted a minute, tops. \n\nAnd then he removed the catheter and speculum and that was that. The whole thing took less than 5 minutes. They asked me to remain lying down for a couple of minutes. \n\nThe doctor showed me my results on the x-ray screen. My tubes were open. My left Fallopian tube and ovary are way up high in my abdomen (?!) and I may have a tiny polyp in my uterus, but he didn't seem concerned by it. \n\nThen he left and the x-ray tech asked me to sit up slowly to make sure I wasn't light headed. I felt fine. Got dressed and noticed I was spotting bright red blood, which they told me was expected. \n\nAnd that was it. They said they'd send the x rays to our RE and sent us on our way. Last step is for the husband to get a SA done (Friday) and our follow up appointment with the RE is Monday when we'll find out what the plan is. I'm tentatively diagnosed with PCOS. \n\nAnyway...that was my HSG experience, start to finish. I had some very mild cramping in the car on the way back to work but it's gone now. \n\nI hope this helps anyone who isn't sure what to expect.

I lost my shit. \n\nFirst, I'm still getting used to these ultrasounds while bleeding. This was my 2nd. I took off my pants, pulled out my tampon and hopped on the table. Then, I immediately felt a flow that went down between my legs and start soaking the little puppy-pad thing they put down. Then the Dr comes in, and I'm like, ugh, it's bad down there. He doesn't say anything. Doesn't look up from his notepad.\n\nHe asks what we're going to want to do this cycle. We said IUI. Now, lets back track a bit. After my lap in Oct, he wanted us to try natural with no meds for 3 months. Then, at the second follow-up he says, I think we should add Clomid. We're still on the first cycle. I said okay. Then, on the CD12 he starts talking about when the IUI will be, trigger, etc. Then my husband said what? I thought you wanted us to do the natural? Then the Dr says, well you can, but you only have about a 6-10% chance. Why didn't he say that to begin with?! We decided not to do the IUI that cycle. But our natural attempt, even with the Clomid and three follicles, was a bust. \n\nBack to yesterday, we say IUI. Y'all, this is a big step for me. I felt like I was really taking a big step and putting on my big girl pants and all of that. Reminding myself what I was told in ifbabies, they all come out the same. Then he says, you guys need to start thinking about IVF. With endo/unexplained, this is really what you should be doing. Then we can look at the embryos.\n\nI died y'all. I went into full-on heave cries. Like cries I had only had when my brother died. I feel like the Dr is not even trying! Shouldn't we do more tests first? We're barely starting our second post-lap cycle. I just feel like he wants us out of his hair. Every time we see him it's something more and more extreme. I just don't see how he can know IVF is the only way yet. My husband has really good swimmers, I ovulate and respond well to Clomid, uterus looks good, tubes are clear, endo/endometrioma is gone, how can IVF be his logical conclusion at this point?! I felt suckerpunched. \n\nAlso, the room was tiny and he had two med students with him. It was a sardine can, and everyone saw my bloody bits. I was so embarrassed. I know it's the way it is, but geeze. \n\nI cried all night, then when I finally fell asleep I dreamed I found a bunch of dead animals/pets in my moms house. :(\n\nIs all of this normal? If you're case is similar, when did you RE suggest IVF? Am I being difficult/overly emotional? Tell me like it is, please.\n\nAnd you guys are just the best. Really, every. last. one of you. &lt;3\n\n**UPDATE: I've got such a busy day at work, I won't have time to respond to all of you right away, but I want to say thank you all so much for your input! It seems the consensus is, after this cycle, I need to get a second opinion and state my concerns from the get-go. Sounds like you all agree, even if IVF is good option, it's really too soon to tell, and he should have broached the topic in a more consciousness way.

I saw two options- Dr. M and Dr J.  Dr. M is an OBGYN with extensive fertility expertise- even had a clinic with Dr. J in the 80s. Dr. M is extremely through and wants to run basically every blood test again, he wants to look at my HSG results himself.  I got the world's longest and most through twat wanding- seriously, like 8 minutes- and they found cysts on my ovaries when no one else has ever looked that hard or found them.  He thinks I might have PCOS.  He kind of feels like the Dr. House of fertility.  The downside is that he doesn't only do fertility, and that gives me pause.  I scheduled a follow up appointment in a month after he looks at all of my test results.\n\nDr. J has the best IVF rates in the state and he has the arrogant attitude to go with that.  He rolls his eyes at all of the other doctor's diagnoses and believes I have endometriosis. Of all of the REs I have seen, he feels like the only one who is a step ahead of me.  He looked super throughly at my chart and truly grasped everything I had been through and most of his suggestions are things that I thought myself along the way (he thinks I was under medicated for the IVFs, that I triggered too early, etc.).  Although his confidence often drops into arrogance, his level of expertise and intimate understanding of fertility feels extremely high.  I scheduled a lap with him in February.  \n\nMy initial thought was to cancel my follow up with Dr. M and not do the tests he ordered.  But yesterday I thought... why not both?  Why not do the tests Dr. M ordered and have the follow up and then go from there?  I realize that means I am working with two doctors at once for a month but I have nothing to do for Dr. J in that month.  I like all of the tests Dr. M want to run and I like how anal he is.  He's also the leading OBGYN surgeon in the state, so having him look at my HSG sounds awesome- just in case!  Being unexplained is driving me batty and Dr. M is the one who really wants to figure it out- the other doctors are more focused on getting me pregnant.  Obviously, pregnancy is the end goal but it'd be nice to know if the treatment I am doing can even work.  \n\nThoughts? \n\nEDIT:  To clarify, Dr. M is no longer in practice with Dr. J.

I don't know why posting seems so hard- maybe because it makes this seem more real? Also, my apologies as this is way longer than I thought it would be.\n\nBackground:\n-Went off hormonal bc in 2008. TTC for 6 months. Got stressed out and decided to NTNP and see what happened.\n\n-Started having severe pain in 2011. Hadn't been to the gyn in years and was terrified to go because I was afraid something was terribly wrong.\n\n-Husband finally convinced me to go in 2012 (I was having trouble even going to the bathroom at this point). Trans-vaginal ultrasound found 9cm endometrioma. Had 1st lap in July 2012 to remove endometrioma and was diagnosed with stage 4 endo.\n\n-Was put on hormonal bc to tame the remaining endo until March 2013. Started NTNP again (kind of- I was temping so I knew when my fertile times were and we did not avoid)\n\n-October 2013 pain was back and worse than before. Ultrasounds showed bilateral endometriomas. Started researching specialists for endo excision.\n\n-March 2014 contacted 3 specialists and narrowed down my choice to a doctor in Maine. Scheduled 2nd lap for total excision of endo.\n\n-July 2014 had total excision of endo removed from both ovaries, both pelvic sidewalls, both utero-sacral ligaments, bladder flap, and my rectum. I was like a new person- truly pain free for the first time since 2011.\n\n-October 2014 exhaustion was back along with the familiar pain of endometriomas. Dr. ordered ultrasound which found 2 small 'endometriomas' on left ovary. He wasn't convinced and ordered follow up ultrasounds in December 2014 and March 2015. Also had me start pelvic floor pt. Started actively TTC.\n\n-March 2015 ultrasound found multi-chambered endometriomas that had grown very quickly on left ovary. I had just started a new job and couldn't get leave for surgery yet so was put on Prozac to help with fatigue and anxiety.\n\n-July 2015 flew to Maine for removal of left ovary and tube along with 2 very large multi-chambered endometriomas. No other endo was found during this lap so the excision worked (yay!)\n\n-Now- still actively trying. Husband is finally coming to realize that the 'it will happen at the right time' may not be true naturally for us. We've decided if I don't get pregnant by February, then we will see the RE about our options. This is a huge step because he has never really wanted to go to the RE before. \n\ntl:dr: 'trying' since 2008. stage 4 endo. one ovary. finally pain free!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New here- intro", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3vfddl/new_here_intro/"}, {"author": "allbustnoballs", "author_created_utc": 1416194477, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC #1; MFI, 5 IUIs with donor sperm", "author_fullname": "t2_je9v9", "created_utc": 1449244177, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3vfdto/timing_of_iui_with_frozen_donor_sperm/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3vfdto", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3vfdto/timing_of_iui_with_frozen_donor_sperm/", "retrieved_on": 1454893416, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "We are using donor sperm due to MFI.

It changes nothing about the way I feel about him at all and I can't wait to marry my best friend. We plan to get engaged after our house sells and we are both going to be 30 soon. This puts us in a bit of a time crunch to make a decision about children. He mentioned adoption and/or IVF- though I was a little confused by the IVF because he stated there was 0 chance for a biological child. I am completely ignorant about all things infertility so I'll definitely have to start doing some research. I have a child from a previous relationship who he loves dearly and is Dad to him in every way except blood. I could not get a specific answer as to how he is not fertile other than he said he has known since birth and produces no testosterone at all. I want to ask more questions because he did seem eager to explore other options to have a child. He was very distressed during the conversation we had and I could tell it was something he didn't want to discuss at length at that point in time so I didn't push him by asking the millions of questions that I have. So my questions to you are: How do I bring up the conversation again and how long should I wait? Does being almost 30 mean we need to start looking at our options as soon as possible?

We didn't have good insurance coverage until this year, so work up was started this summer. His SA was okay - not the greatest morphology but total count and motility are good. I did my HSG about 6 weeks ago and got the devastating news that my tubes are blocked, including a hydrosalpinx on one. (The other tube is also blocked at the distal end, but isn't dilated- the dye just stops, and won't flow out). \n\nI'm having laparoscopic surgery tomorrow afternoon so my GYN can take a look at everything, push dye again, and remove the hydrosalpinx. I am hopeful everything goes well!\n\nMy husband and I met with a RE a couple of weeks ago and are trying to mentally prepare for IVF. The RE absolutely wants the hydrosalpinx out, and actually has some hope that maybe the other tube just spasmed during the HSG. His opinion is that the fluid that drains from the hydrosalpinx is toxic and significantly impairs embryo implantation in the uterus - so if anything is getting through the other tube, it's not implanting because of the hydrosalpinx. I would love for the hydrosalpinx removal to be the solution, because IVF is so damn expensive and we have no infertility coverage, but I am trying to not get my hopes up.\n\nIf you're the praying type, or willing to send some positive vibes my way tomorrow afternoon, I would greatly appreciate it. I have never had any type of surgery before and am pretty nervous! \n\nIf you've had this type of procedure before, how did your recovery go? My doc didn't give me much info about what to expect.

My husband and I don't have money for IVF and its looking like that is our next step. I did some research and found a study running nationwide that would cover 90% of the cost of ivf for us. I spoke to my doctor and they said I qualified. I was excited and scared at the same time. I was supposed to go in tomorrow for an appointment to go over the study, the forms to sign, and basically what was going to happen. \n\nWell, this afternoon I get an email from the doctor apologizing because I don't qualify. Since I have PCOS, I am not allowed to be in the study. I feel angry and hurt. I feel like the people at my doctors office weren't doing their job. They told me back in October that I qualified and you just NOW realized I don't? Oh well. It looks like we will be moving forward with adoption.\n \nAlthough, if anyone is interested, there is a nationwide study called the megaset study running. The company will pay for about 90% of your ivf. You get one transfer in the study, you can't have PCOS, have to have a bmi under 30, and an amh over a certain number (I'm sorry I don't remember what it was). I suggest you check it out of ask your doctor about it if you are looking to pursue ivf.

I think I'm mostly doing this so that maybe I'll finally cry.  So far it's working.\n\n**TL;DR** I'm a mid-20s female, Husband is mid-20s male.  I was diagnosed with PCOS at 16.  Husband was just told over the past few months that he has (severe?) sperm problems.  We've been exploring both adoption and IVF.  \n\n**A brief history of time:**\n\nOctober, 2014: Visit OB/GYN, get put on Metformin and prenatals.\n\nJanuary-March, 2015: 3 cycles of unmonitored Femara 2.5 mg, home ovulation tests.  No positive pregnancy tests.  Explore adoption as a first option or as a secondary option after fertility treatments.\n\nApril-June, 2015: Focus on some personal issues, no birth control and no fertility treatments.  Remain on Metformin, prenatals.  No positive pregnancy tests.\n\nJuly, 2015: Meet with Reproductive Endocrinologist.  Blood tests come back mostly normal but with one value slightly elevated for my age.  I don't remember which one right now, but the doctor noted that it might be indicative of diminishing egg reserve and that it's a good thing we've begun treatment now.  HSG is clear.  Husband's semen analysis isn't so great.  Concentration is 13 million/mL and 1% normal morphology.  Doctor suggests 1-3 cycles of IUI using Femara and trigger shot, then on to IVF.\n\nAugust-November, 2015: Focus on some personal issues.  Explore adoption and IVF a little deeper.\n\nDecember, 2015: First IUI cycle.  Husband's sperm numbers post-wash are not great.  Less than 3 million total motile sperm.  Doctor puts our chances of success through IUI at about 15%/month. Desperate Googling suggests this might be positive thinking. It's unclear to me how low these numbers are and whether or not a few more IUIs are worth the effort.\n\nToday: I'm 3 days past IUI and I'm angry, I'm upset, I'm exhausted, and I'm so, so sad.  I'm scared to be pregnant, I'm scared to not be pregnant.  I want to do IVF and also I can't imagine going through IVF.  But I picked up some gummy prenatal vitamins yesterday, so that was fun I guess.\n\nThank you all for reading about my life over the past year and for the support I've gotten from this subreddit even as a lurker.  I guess today I'm finally upset enough to reach out.\n\n**Edit:** Revised husband's post-wash value.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New Member Introduction", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3vuw0x/new_member_introduction/"}, {"author": "KnickerSnickers", "author_created_utc": 1343800981, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "24 | TTC 1.5 years | mc 12/15", "author_fullname": "t2_8is7w", "created_utc": 1449532141, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3vuwx4/one_step_forward_two_steps_back_trigger_loss/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3vuwx4", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 12, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3vuwx4/one_step_forward_two_steps_back_trigger_loss/", "retrieved_on": 1454900802, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "If you've been following my posts, you know that I had my first cycle on gonal-f/menopur/letrozole after multiple failed clomid cycles. I didn't post my results in the results thread because I'm a \"proceed with caution\" sort, but a week ago Monday 11/30 I got a call from the doctor saying I was pregnant. I was absolutely over the moon and so was my husband. They scheduled a follow up for me to have more blood drawn to ensure everything was progressing as it should be.\n\nI got a call Thursday 12/3 that my levels were not doubling as they should be (120; was 81 three days before). I did enough Googling to know that every forum or reddit post I could find out there of a woman with similar results ended in miscarriage. On Friday we had an appointment with the doctor who said to not worry yet and that he's seen tests be wrong and everyone's body is different and blah blah blah.\n\nI was on edge all weekend and went in first thing this morning to get my blood drawn. I checked my phone every 5 seconds and began calling when I didn't hear from them by when I usually do. My husband called them while I was in a meeting and they said my levels had dropped to 76 and to prepare to miscarry. He called me and I left work an hour early without telling anyone why other than I wasn't feeling well. It's so hard to have all these pregnancy symptoms (soreness of breasts, nausea, bloating) and know that whoever is inside of me is dying.\n\nI'm trying to look at the bright side because now at least I know it *can* happen. Miscarriages happen even in healthy women who don't have any trouble getting pregnant so I'm hoping this doesn't mean I'm more likely to miscarry in the future. The doctor said that it's better to have an early miscarriage than live with an unhealthy child the rest of my life, and while I see his point, it just seems to cruel that after all this time/effort/money/frustration to be given everything and have it taken all away.\n\nI'm sorry if I'm posting this on the wrong subreddit.

They're roughly the same age as my husband and I, have been married about the same length of time, but never seemed interested in having kids because they're both very busy working professionals. When I saw the announcement I was hit with an intense wave of jealousy, sadness, and so many other emotions. I hate feeling like this every time someone announces a pregnancy. I want desperately to celebrate with them and be happy for them, but it's getting more and more difficult for me to get my head into that space. \n\nWe've been trying for almost 10 years now. We started off with an HSG, several rounds of clomid, and some progesterone suppositories before we both decided we were young enough to see what would happen if we left things to nature. I was 23 then...now I'm 32 and we're just getting back into treatments. Last month we did another round of clomid with a follicle scan (mature follicles on both ovaries) and trigger shot, but my period started right on time and here I am. Still with out hope and full of hope all at the same time.\n\nBecoming pregnant feels like a total pipe dream right now. A complete fantasy. I feel, especially on days like this, that there is no hope for us. And yet every cycle it all comes rushing back during the two week wait, just so it can be crushed again when the first signs of my period appear. I hate hoping and dreaming, but I can't seem to control it. \n\nThe only bright spot in my journey right now is that I was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism, so the treatment for that is only just starting to take effect and could positively affect my fertility. It's possible that it has my thyroid causing the issues all along, but I suspect there's more to it than that. I just hate not knowing for sure.\n\nSorry foe my rambling thoughts. I'm still processing my friend's announcement and my brain is just a mess.
