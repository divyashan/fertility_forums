The general consensus was she was \"too much.\" My mother thinks this was unprofessional of them to tell me this, but I mean fucks sake I'm there every day for the past two years, it's not like they're probably telling everyone who walks in.\n\nSO anyhow, the new nurse was assigned to my transfer. She's around 55 years old and is grinning like a maniac at me walking me back to pre op.\n\nShe asks me if I've done this before (fair question) and I was like \"yes, I know the drill\" and then she grins at me like a deaths head and goes \"DID IT WORK?\"\n\nWut. I sort of look at her for a second and I was like... \"well.. no.\" and then she goes \"WELL THIS ONE IS THE ONE!\"\n\nSilence on my part. The phlebotomist was walking through and heard the whole exchange and is miming exaggerated eye rolls behind her.\n\nWhatever, she's new, it's fine. We go in for my transfer, and even though I've told her that this is not my first rodeo, she's explaining everything and super nervous. Fine, I let her explain, maybe this is her first transfer. She also expresses sorrow that my husband isn't with me - I tell her he never comes and she makes a BIG FROWNY FACE AT ME.  Excuse, he does not need to be here when they shove a straw up my cervix. We just aren't that couple.\n\nFINALLY my awesome doctor comes in and we are ready to go. Doctor is like \"Let's do this!\" and I go \"Lets get me knocked up!\" and the nurse sort of skitters uncomfortably. Embryo up on the screen, name check, yup that's mine and the fucking nurse goes \"There's your baby!\"\n\nThat was it for me - I told her that wasn't a baby. Dr. also agrees, that's not a baby. Then Dr. and I talk about the forest fires in this state while she gets my cervix straw all up in there, while the nurse weirdly puts her hand on my should her and keeps trying to look into my eyes like we are all making the miracle of life together. \n\nAfter the transfer while they're flushing out the catheter making sure lone embryo isn't stuck up in there, my Dr. was like \"you  have no idea how much everyone here wants this for you\" and the nurse jumps in with \"we want it for EVERY patient!!\" AND that was the end of that convo. I could only see my Dr.'s eyes, but they were hysterical. She was TFAB come to life. LIVE TFAB.\n\nI was laughing so hard when I left, it was probably beneficial for transfer. I can't imagine having to do procedures with Mary Sunshine every day - but they're also lucky that I wasn't having a sensitive day, because who the FUCK ASKS YOU IF YOUR LAST TRANSFER FAILED AT YOUR OWN RE's office.

I'll try not to make this too long. \n\nI have a friend. We'll call her Lola. She became one of my closest friends when I moved 5 years ago to a new city. I was partnered up and she was my kooky, fun-loving single friend who always took me on adventures with her. Three years later, she started dating her now husband. But she was still mostly down for fun stuff. \n\nShe was a bridesmaid in my wedding, which was almost 3 years ago now. Lola felt a little uncomfortable that her bf hadn't proposed to her yet, and often talked about feeling \"behind\" with me, which I told her I understood, but she absolutely should not ever feel that way! In the meantime, my husband and I moved for work to another city about 3 hrs away. Then Lola got engaged about a year and a half ago. I was so thrilled for her and she asked me to be a bridesmaid. \n\nI came out to her about my infertility in a tearful phone conversation. She said a few weird things, oscillating between \"that would feel like a death sentence\" and \"its no big deal, you can just do IVF, right?\" but was mostly supportive. I told her that one of the surprising things about dealing with IF has been my difficulty talking about babies and pregnancy with other people- its very painful. \n\nAs all this was going on, I planned and hosted her bachelorette party. This occurred this past May. At the bachelorette, every single person there was either pregnant or a parent, except for Lola and me. Lola basically spent the entire 2 1/2 days talking about her plans for pregnancy, her baby names, asking pregnant people tons of questions, etc. Ignoring me of course in the mix. Basically 100% ignoring what I told her, which was that conversations about pregnancy are very hard for me. I got really mad a few times, but I didnt say anything because this was her bachelorette. (Aren't we supposed to be like looking at naked dudes or something? What kind of a bachelorette is this?!)\n\nCut to 5 days before her wedding. This is June of this year. Lola had asked me to be the only other person besides her sister to give a toast at her wedding. I was happy to do it, despite being frustrated with her lately. Lola texts me and our mutual friend (who has been extremely supportive of me despite being very pregnant)  that she \"got some weird news.\" She proceeds to say over text that she was pregnant at her bachelorette (she was wasted the whole time, but I assume she did not know), but she went in for a check-up and she had a missed miscarriage. \"I have to get it vacuumed out now! Whoops!\" Those were her exact words. \n\nMy first reaction was OMG POOR LOLA. My second was wondering why she was being so cavalier about this. I called her to ask if she was doing okay, what I could do, and she literally said \"I am actually fine, just annoyed if I can't have sex on my honeymoon. But at the end of the day, at least I know I can GET pregnant. Woohoo!\"\n\nI almost died right there. I had to get off the phone quickly and deal with a lot of sh*t. Like you are bragging to me about getting pregnant without trying? Anyway. I gave her toast at her wedding, it was all lovely, she had a D&amp;C and had a lovely honeymoon, etc. Meanwhile, I was going through IVF- shots and drs appts and my retrieval- none of which she was there for. She didnt call to ask me about it. \n\nTwo months ago I wrote her an email to try to lightly explain why this time had been hard for me and how I wanted to save our friendship. She gave me a (mostly) sweet reply and my heart melted for her again. I still didnt trust her with all the details of my situation, so I didnt tell her when we were going to transfer our embryo. \n\nWe went ahead and transferred in October. It failed. I was in a depression for about 3 weeks that I have recently come out of. I wrote Lola an email after some time to tell her what had happened. She wrote me back to say how sorry she was, but how much she looked forward to seeing me over Thanksgiving. \n\nCut to yesterday. She wrote me an email and guess what: she's pregnant. What's more? Her due date is when mine would have been- had my embryo lived. \n\nI haven't responded to her because I am grappling with being there for her, saving our friendship, and taking care of me. I just don't understand why 2016 is so goddamn awful and why the universe just keeps throwing this shit my way. I am trying to go into 2017 after healing from our first FET and trying to gear up for another transfer, and then this is what happens?\n\nShe's been a good friend to me in other respects, and she was there for me when my mom was sick last year. But this seems to be..a tough issue for us. \n\n\ntl;dr: a very close friend of mine had previously put distance between us bc she was insensitive about my infertility. but now she is pregnant and her due date is what mine was before i lost my embryo. i love her but i need to love myself, what do i do?\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Having a hard time: friend rant", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5dsq7q/having_a_hard_time_friend_rant/"}, {"author": "Fishface248", "author_created_utc": 1412542478, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "31, TTC 1/2015, unexplained, 5 IUI's, IVF 1 now", "author_fullname": "t2_ipwqx", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1479578873, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5dto5n/amh/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5dto5n", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5dto5n/amh/", "retrieved_on": 1484253287, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I had the graduation talk with my RE.

We officially started trying after we got married last November;  I always knew in the back of my head that it would be a challenge because my periods have been irregular and my GYN said she thought I might have PCOS. Last week I finally saw an RE and after reviewing my cycles and previous blood work he very clearly stated that I'm not ovulating.  He then asked about a LEEP procedure I had in 2010 and stated that that procedure most likely compromised my cervix and is most likely the reason I don't produce any cervical fluid, and definitely don't have any good stuff to help the sperm. Finally he threw in the \"advanced reproductive age\" line.... But he said he believes IUI could definitely work if my husband's SA comes back positive.  And that's where everything went to shit...\n\nMy husband has no sperm, 2 tests both confirm zero sperm... Next is blood work to test hormone levels... His FSH and LH levels indicate \"failure\" which the RE explained was very uncommon but equivalent to male menopause. He referred to a urologist that specializes in male infertility but I don't feel much hope at this point. And on top of that my HSG x-ray showed some blockage in one of my tubes....\n\nAll of this started on the same day of the freaking election and it feels like my world is just full of shit right now....

I introduced myself a couple months back, but for the most part have been lurking ever since. \n\nBackground: We've been trying since October 2015. Diagnosed with PCOS six months in, and I've completed four rounds of Femara with TI. First round at 2.5 failed according to progesterone checks, next three at 5 caused ovulation according to ovulation tests and 7DPO blood draws. I've never had a positive pregnancy test.\n\nMy doctor (not an RE, but OBGYN who \"specializes\" in infertility at my group office) suggested moving on to IUI. I like him, and have liked his laid back approach in the past. He's the doctor who put me on Femara and who does all of my monthly checkups. The one downside, which I used to think was a positive, is that he's pretty lax on monitoring. For the Femara cycles, I've always just used OPKs and done the blood draws with monthly pelvic exams, and I appreciated that because of my crazy work schedule (I travel for work, often overnight, so making appointments for specific days in a cycle can be super difficult).\n\nWhen I went to talk to him today, he said we'd go ahead with the IUI, but that the monitoring (or lack thereof) would be the same. Call when you see a surge, IUI will be the next day. While I used to not mind this, it's kind of got me a little more worried to know that I *don't* know exactly how I'm responding to this medication, and whether it's barely working or maybe working too well. \n\nMy insurance covers all of the medications and testing for infertility, but has a lifetime limit for actual procedures, so the IUI's will count towards that at $400/month (and we have a $10k lifetime limit). \n\nI'm considering calling the closest RE's office to see their availability, but am worried that starting that process will end up with me having so many required appointments that I will have a really tough time making each and every single one every month due to the nature of my job, and that that will almost be worse that doing these cycles with \"lite\" monitoring. I know so many recommend the RE, and for good reason. I'm just stuck on what to do when I don't have the typical 9-5 job. My work is pretty understanding so far, but I'm not sure how well they (or the clients I'm at daily) would do with more appointment than I already have now. \n\nAny advice? \n\nDo I try a month or two here or seek out moving on to an RE immediately? I know that this is the last step he really offers.

I said that was supposed to happen two days ago and asked if a doctor would call me. She said she would pass along the message.\n\nAnother two days passed. Nobody got in touch.

My husband and I have been trying to conceive since September 2014. I got pregnant in two months, but when I went in for the first ultrasound, the OB couldn't find a heartbeat. Because it was two days before Christmas and the office was closing for the holiday, they told me I had to do a D&amp;C that day. I went in that morning thinking I was going to share an ultrasound picture with my visiting family that night, and walked out kind of in shock.\n\nAfter about six more months of trying, I just felt like something was wrong, so we saw an RE, and did two IUIs, and both failed. At that point, they did a full work up and told me (through email!) that I had DOR. We moved to IVF, and I didn't respond very well, and only had one day 5 blast. We transferred it and got two very strong betas. When I went in for the first ultrasound, though, his (I know it was a boy because of later testing) heartbeat was only 90 and the RE told me there was essentially no chance of survival. I had to keep going in for ultrasounds until his heartbeat stopped, at which point I had another D&amp;C, and testing revealed a chromosomal abnormality.\n\nAfter I recovered, I decided to switch clinics, and found one in another state that I liked. My RE there recommended we do the embryo banking program because of my DOR. So we did retrievals there in June, August, and October, loading up the car and the dog and spending 10-12 days in an airbnb each time. After all that, we have some frozen, PGS-normal blasts, and we're going back for a FET in December. \n\nOh, and about a year and a half ago, we moved to a new state for my job, and have been told about 1000 times that \"it will be so much easier to make friends here when you have kids.\"\n\nSorry for the long intro. My life has been so completely taken over by this process, and reading this sub has been hugely helpful to know that I'm not the only person going through this, which I so often feel.

Does anyone have any advice dealing with changing jobs while dealing with infertility uncertainty?

I need to give them my decision by Monday, but I've already asked for more time. \n\nIt's a really cool offer, but I could definitely do something else. I have another offer with a much more flexible start date. \n\nSo, is it lame to accept a job knowing I could possibly be out immediately? We've been trying for almost two years and I'm tired of planning around the thing isn't happening, but I don't know what's ethical here. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nUpdate: first, thanks to the many amazing responses! This ended up being a nonissue. Not pregnant, of course. However, I do think that I would have told them if I was... it was a lot of soul-searching and talking with my partner, but it was just too important for me to know what kind of support I would have (and there was really no other way to find out without being so obvious), to start making real plans, and overall it just felt skeezy. Idk. Maybe I would have not gone through with it in the end, but I just wanted this update to be out there if anyone is in this situation again and wants to chat.

I'm so upset, angry, and confused this morning.

Did that for a week until I got my period on Saturday, 11/19.  Decreased Lupron to 5 units, started 225 Gonal F + 75 Menopur (a pretty standard protocol for someone my age, I'm told).  Today is cycle day five.  I went to see the RE this morning for an ultrasound. Turns out I currently have ONE big follicle at 19mm - an early developer or whatever the hell that was sucking up all my meds.  Needless to say, my cycle is cancelled.  No point in doing a retrieval just for one egg.  Apparently this sort of situation is rare (?), but not unheard of, but that certainly doesn't exactly make me feel any better about the situation. The nurse told me that this has happened to other women they've treated and those women go on to have successful retrievals on different protocols, but I'm still scared.  At this point, my doctor's going to regroup and come up with a new protocol.  I'll most likely have to wait until after Christmas to get started again.  This is so fucking unfair, I'm just tired of it. So tired of all of it.  \n\nHas anything similar happened to anyone here?  If so, did you go on to have a successful egg retrieval on a different protocol?\n\nOn top of this shit, I had dinner with  my best friend last night who is currently 13 weeks pregnant after trying (naturally) for one month.  She sat there and told me how much being pregnant sucks and how horrible she feels all the time... I get it, it's no fun being nauseated and tired all the time, but do you really think I'm the person you should be venting about this to? I didn't know what to say.  I understand that she's my best friend and she's used to talking to me about anything and everything that's bothering her, but in this case it just seems a little fucked up.

I don't know. I thought maybe rambling them out here would help. \n\nI am feeling really guilty about this cycle failure. I drank a lot (for me) in the summer before IVF. I got drunk once almost every weekend. Which for me is like, a bottle of wine or 4 G&amp;Ts, so it's not like I am a crazy lush. But still....I feel like it made me unhealthy. (I did not drink during IVF though)\n\nThis year I have gone from the high-end of normal for my height (5'5\" 140-145 lbs) to 159. I bought a new pair of size 10 (old navy - so really not a 10) pants a couple weeks ago, and today I have to loop an elastic around the button to expand them to be comfortable. *I want to note here: this isn't about this size being wrong generally. I know size and weight are different for everyone. But this size and weight are where my body starts to feel sore, uncomfortable and unfit and it makes me feel pretty shitty. If you are bigger or smaller, I make no judgements on that here).*\nI completely stopped exercising over a year ago, not counting a week here or there where I would tell myself I was getting back on track and then dropped it immediately again.  I ate junk food and SO MUCH sugar, rationalizing all of my poor health choices because of the medications and the stress of infertility. \n\nNow, I feel like it's my fault this cycle failed. I feel like if I had been healthier, exercised more, made better food choices, cut caffeine earlier and completely instead of just by half, and not drank at all, that I would have had a better count at retrieval. That so many follicles wouldn't have been empty, and that I might have some back up embryos in the freezer right now. But I didn't and I don't. And I blame myself. \n\nAnd its shitty, because I would never allow a single one of you to blame yourselves for your failed cycles. I would tell you that it's not your fault. It isn't fair, but it is not on you. But I just can't seem to muster that feeling up for myself. \n\nI feel ashamed that I can't get my shit together. How can I be willing to jab needles in my belly, ride these hormone roller coasters, and go through all these invasive procedures, and yet I can't push myself to get out for a walk or go for a swim, because I just don't feel like it? I track calories and see myself going over and I just don't care. Do I really feel that worthless? That I have stopped giving a shit about myself or my health or well being so completely. \n\nI am not cycling again until the new year. I am going on BCPs (otherwise we risk major cysts) for December and I am hoping that I can focus on healing inside a little. I do see a counselor (I have an appointment this saturday) and we are working on these issues, but I just can't seem to make that final shift from intellectually know what I need to do and why I do or don't take action, to finally taking real life steps to better my health and well being. \n\nI am so sad you guys. And I feel so guilty. And I feel terribly alone IRL.\n\n\n**A little note:** Thank you all for the support and compassion from all of you! It honestly means so much to me that you are all here and rooting for me and care about my feelings and well being. I makes a world of difference, especially since I know you all carry your own pain as well. So thank you to all of you.

We're looking at a big 0 sperm, repeated multiple times.\n\n\nOur fertility clinic didn't give us a great prognosis from there. They could do the micro TESE and ICSI, but they were very uh... stark... with the chances of that working. Plus my husband would have to come off of the testosterone for several months (which is going to throw him on a roller coaster), and each attempt would mean he would need to supplement more and more testosterone. We decided this option was not for us, and have since snuck a few peeks at various sperm donor websites.\n\n\nWe're not ready to really go all in just yet; I'm wrapping up my master's so I'd like to finish that before we add the stress of treatment. Logically I know this, but the emotional part of my brain is just fixating on it. Combined with a barrage of less-than-helpful comments (everything happens for a reason, maybe it's just not meant to be, if it's supposed to happen it'll happen...) I'm feeling frustrated, hopeless, annoyed, and guilty.\n\n\nAnd there's a small part of me that I can't quite get to shut up, that wonders if maybe they're right. Maybe I'm not supposed to have kids and I should just focus on what I do have.\n\n\nTL,DR: MFI. 0 Sperm. Emotions. Angst. Does anyone else have an annoying inner voice telling them to just give up?

Looks like there are 5 follicles on the right and 3 on the left. Not great, so the change in medication didn't do much (even though he didn't change it to the past protocol that had worked, like I wanted). He thinks we'll probably get 5 at retrieval based on the sizes. So, fuck. \n\nWe are planning on doing day 3 PGS with day 5 transfer, after having had a mc on IVF #2 (and never getting anything past day 5 to freeze). So you generally want 10 or so embryos to biopsy on day 3. We have three day-3's frozen (from IVF #3 and 4 with this guy, no transfer done), so having only 5 retrieved this time would be shitty.\n\nSo as I'm changing after the ultrasound, I hear my husband say something like is it even worth bothering to continue the cycle. Then I come out and the RE is now suddenly talking about donor eggs and how that could be much better retrieval numbers. \n\nNow, I have no known fertility factors, and in my first two IVFs at another clinic, they retrieved 13 and then 15 eggs. That was back in Feb/Mar. We left that clinic because we wanted to do PGS moving forward and the RE wasn't really for it.  Donor eggs have NEVER been mentioned by anyone.  \n\nNow, suddenly with this new guy, I'm getting under 10 eggs at retrieval. (last round was 5). It seems like the left ovary is not responding much at all. No idea as to why. He has also never replicated the exact protocol from the first clinic in feb/march, so who knows if that old protocol would still work. Or maybe my ovaries just said fuck it and can't do what they could 5 or 6 months ago. Who knows? But we are still getting eggs. Problem is not all fertilize.\n\nSo suddenly going to donor eggs is a huge fucking jump, no? It really threw me for a loop. And then I asked if with donor sperm, we'd be doing just IUIs, right? and he said yes. And my husband asked if we did IVF with donor sperm, fertilization rate would be better, right? And he said yes. And then later said no. And then said yes. And then said donor eggs with husbands sperms would get us better embryo numbers for PGS. And then said, or we could do my eggs with donor sperm. But he was really pushing the donor egg thing as just an easy solution, just like fucking that. Or keep doing what we are doing with different meds, etc. So basically, no clear answers from him. I feel like he's just trying to find the fastest solution to pregnancy, without accounting for the fact that having to do donor anything is a huge step, and I'd like to avoid that until there's no other option.\n\nNow I'm totally fucking lost. We are going to finish up this cycle because I've spent a bunch on meds already. I might just tell them to go ahead with PGS anyway even if we only have like 7 or 8  because we've already paid for PGS. But I really feel like I'm done with this clinic. I have no fertilization reports from the last 2 cycles from them. Or even receipts. No new bloodwork has been run except for the STD panel, and then estradiol at the end of stimming for one of the cycles. \n\nWhat the fuck do I do? Go back to fresh transfers and forget PGS and risk a miscarriage? He said because transfer #1 didn't take, and transfer 2 ended in MC, there's a strong chance the embryos all had genetic problems, hence pushing for PGS. But after the MC, it was discovered I have a clotting issue, so that could account for it.

I need to write.\n\nMy wife and I started trying in January after she had surgery in August 2015 to have her Thyroid Cancer removed and had Radioactive Iodine Treatment in October to make sure it's all gone. We found out we could get pregnant no problem. But please, before the hate starts rolling in, keep reading.\n\nWe had a chemical pregnancy at the end of January. We tried again in February and had a 6 week miscarriage in March. We decided to wait until July to try again, figured we were fertile and just to give her body time. And we wanted to try to have a spring baby, plan it out. \n\nNo. On Thanksgiving this year, just 2 days ago on November 24th, we lost our baby Austin. We found out a week prior that he had marginal cord insertion and single umbilical cord artery. They told us it shouldn't be an issue but we'd have more appts. My wife stopped feeling him move last Friday but everywhere online said not to worry. Our fetal dopplar stopped picking up the heart rate. She knew. I was in denial. We had our follow up ultrasound on Wednesday and it was confirmed. He was gone. They induced and she had to give birth. Luckily no physical pain. But it took until Thanksgiving morning. It was the most painful, depressing emotion we've ever had to go through. We held him, took his picture. He looked at peace. But he was only 21 weeks. I cried the most. I told our close family, so many came out of nowhere telling us of their own miscarriages. Some trying to compare, but it's not the same. She's gone through that. It's not the same.\n\nI'm the extrovert in our marriage, the more positive one too, the hopeful. Shes the more introverted one, the realist. We're not religious people. She was brought up Jewish. I Catholic. But we don't give a shit about that. Especially not after all that's gone on in her life before and mine and now this. We definitely don't believe there is a God. But I still believe everything happens for a reason. I don't know what this fucked up reason is, I'm trying to think that Austin will be the reason his siblings will live on to be born, and they always know of him. But it's hard to stay positive this time, especially with a wife who has had such a short stick handed to her. I can remind her of all the good right now. But her hormones and everything are going to keep going up and down. And baby triggers are everywhere. \n\nI need help, if anyone else has gone through this, has any advice. Stories. What they did. How things ended up. I can't find anything from the fathers perspective. I'll take the mothers perspective too. I just love and care about my wife so much, and she hasn't given up hope yet but I don't want her to.\n\nEdited: Took out a sentence that might upset others.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need to vent.

(Or maybe I'm just fucking wiped out from a shit ton of company and cooking the last 4 days...) but do you still get PMS without a period?\n\n**tl;dr** I'm curious if any of you ladies still experience the physical/emotional PMS period stuff even when suppressing and not actually menstruating?\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "PMS while on birth control/suppression?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5f0eqg/pms_while_on_birth_controlsuppression/"}, {"author": "pickmeup_powerpuff", "author_created_utc": 1469388215, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_zrzry", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1480182399, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5f0ks9/side_effects_to_progesterone_and_letrozole/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5f0ks9", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5f0ks9/side_effects_to_progesterone_and_letrozole/", "retrieved_on": 1484276373, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi all. I'm new here.  I've been lurking for a little bit and have found a lot of info helpful. \nMy daughter was born in Aug 2015 at 24 weeks and 3 days due to cervical incompetence.  I had a classical c-section due to her being breech. Sadly, she passed away 2 weeks later.  I had a transabdominal cerclage placed in January and have been trying to get pregnant since then.  I had an early MC in July but have otherwise not gotten pregnant.  My FSH is high but my amh is in the normal range. The RE is confident that I should be able to get pregnant.  \nMy progesterone tested lower at 8dpo at 9.2 so I was put on post ovulation progesterone.  We did IUI last cycle and it didn't work.  I had 2 mature follicles.  This cycle the RE has put me on letrozole this cycle for CD 3-7 to have a better chance of more follicles.  I've had so much discomfort since starting the meds- vaginal itching and soreness.  Mr. Powerpuff and I attempted sex a couple of days ago but it was so painful that I had to stop.  \nI am prone to yeast infections and have had two from the progesterone supplements and I first thought that I may have gotten another one but there doesn't seem to be discharge that is typical with yeast. I've also taken two pills of diflucan 2 days apart and there has been no change in symptoms so I'm pretty sure that's not it.  \nI have read so many people that they haven't had any symptoms on letrozole so I'm a bit disappointed if this is caused from the meds but just wondered if anyone had similar reactions? \nAny experiences would be appreciated. \nThanks in advance.
