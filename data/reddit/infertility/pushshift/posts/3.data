Is this over the line of neurotic and planning ahead?\n\nOur plan is to do two more IUIs - one at the beginning of April and one at the beginning of May. Those'll be IUI #4 and #5, but the first with progesterone supplementation. I have to travel for work in June (if I'm not pregnant) and then at the end of June/beginning of July, we'll prep for IVF. \n\nMy husband and I really want to take a vacation, not having gone away on our own since our honeymoon three years ago. Our ability to do it, though, will depend on IVF prep timing. Do you think I can ask for my protocol now, just so I know if I'll have a month of BC or Lupron or something beforehand, during which time we could go away? Is there ever a protocol that doesn't require suppression? The real question, of course, is am I crazy for wanting the plan now and for even trying to go away for a bit? Is this too much to ask of my doctor?\n\nedit: iPhone typing. Also, we're thinking Newfoundland, so any travel advice is more than welcome/appreciated!

Insurance companies don't seem to care and you can't really go elsewhere. The end answer I got was that everyone I talked to was wrong, there was a mistake on the website, they don't offer these meds through mail order and I have to pay the full price. So I'm giving in as I need to start next week. I will still complain and appeal but not hoping for much. At least I found a few better deals.\n\nI know everyone's insurance is different but I wanted to share some prices in case it helps anyone thinking about the cost.

We got pregnant on our own in October after my HSG and lost the baby at 5 weeks.  I got pregnant again in January via IUI and had another CP shortly thereafter.  \n\nWe started Clomid and IUIs in December and are now on our 4th and final medicated IUI cycle.  I was on the minimum dose of Clomid since I ovulate normally, but I only ever had 1 follicle from that each time. For this last cycle they are doubling my clomid to 100mg and putting me on Pogesterone suppositories to hopefully give us our best shot at getting pregnant and not losing it.  Our fingers are crossed for this cycle, but I feel like I need to prepare myself for what lies beyond this cycle.  We have a consultation scheduled with our RE on March 16th to discuss what we are going to do following this cycle if it doesn't work out and I want to prepare myself for what IVF entails.\n\nSo... for the advice part of this post... For those of you who have done IVF, what's the protocol?  Injection medication?  How long do I do that?  What sort of side effects come with that?  Will the meds affect my daily life?  What's up with retrieval?  Did ya'll opt for genetic testing?  How are all of these procedures?  I mean I'm fairly used to the \"dildo-wand\" ultrasounds and the IUIs don't really bother me too much, but I feel like retrieval sounds like a much crazier and invasive maneuver.  So yeah... any advice or stories would be most helpful to this IVF noob.\n\nThank you for reading and I'm sorry that ya'll have to go through this crap too.

My insurance doesn't cover any infertility stuff.  Many labs give a 40% (or so) discount for uninsured people, but if they have your insurance on file the lab won't give you the discount even if you say not to go through insurance.  I have a specific lab I go to that doesn't have my insurance on file and I say I don't have insurance to get the discount.  \n\nYou can also use online companies like healthonelabs.com and order your own blood work.  A progesterone test is $40.  I used them to order my own complete thyroid panel and it is very easy and straight forward.  The downside to the online companies is that it takes an extra day or so to get the results- so if you need the results ASAP, it's not a good option.  If I have to do another cycle, I'm going to talk to my RE about getting my progesterone tested using that service.  It's $90 at my RE, it'll be about $60 at the lab not using insurance, and $40 through healthonelabs.com.  They have all sorts of fertility tests, including estrodiol, FSH, and more and at lower rates.  Your results are emailed to you so it'd be easy to forward them to your doctor.  \n\nEDIT:  A couple things about this that I failed to mention.  First, calling your insurance company to find out if your tests will be covered is a good idea.  You will need the procedure codes and diagnosis code.  Second, this only works if the lab/hospital doesn't already have your insurance on file.  That's why I have a lab that I only use for this hack.

Only being pessimistic  seems to give me more anxiety and sadness.  So, I decided this cycle I am going to try and be some place in the middle.

So far it has only been 3 days since my transfer, but I think I am doing quite well. I have a few obsessive moments, but overall I am staying more grounded.  I've been reading a lot on meditation as well and taking this time to focus on learning how to meditate to calm myself.  This is very odd for me since I have never done yoga or meditated in my life!

I was told I could be spared a baseline, because I was extremely unlikely to develop a cyst, so when CD1 came around I got my meds filled for the next cycle (7.5 femara, 375 menopur) and since I was traveling, got scheduled for my first monitoring.  \n\nOn first monitoring, we had a 12mm follicle and a 21mm something, which seemed suspicious and quite likely a cyst after all, as my lining was still thin though not as thin as 2 cycles ago.  We quit the femara early, continued the menopur.  Friday's ultrasound and the supposed cyst was GONE....  and the 12 shrunk to 10.  She sent me to the lab immediately, said to do the menopur last night but the results should be back in the morning, if more than 1, I likely ovulated Thursday night/Friday morning.  It came back, 2.6.  Thank god for the testing, no wasted meds, and I wasn't temping (thermometer toast), and 2-3 days to notice the difference would be too late anyway.  But I just ovulated on CD8-9.  Let's just call it 9.  It's still NUTS.\n\nFriday I woke up at 4:40am and was wide awake (sound familiar?)  After harumphing silently a few times, I discovered the SO was also awake, and we decided to use that time for the horizontal tango since neither of us had any hope of getting back to sleep.

Had the same the next day. The day after that, it was gone, and the beta confirmed no pregnancy. I'm assuming it was a chemical pregnancy and our embryo(s) just weren't viable.

I appologize if this is REALLY long winded...\n\n I REALLY hate doctors. I turned 30 in December, husband is 28, we have a beautiful 8 year old daughter together. 6 and a half years ago we started trying to have another baby. We got pregnant by surprise the first time, I figured things would be easy the second go round. I was very very wrong...\n\nFirst off, When pregnant with our daughter, my doctors told me I was high risk, but never explained why. I didnt have bad morning sickness, but ended up with a few colds, a UTI, and suffered through Mono, resulting in losing 15-25 lbs during my pregnancy. Despite all that, I felt fantastic, carried my little girl to term, she was born with no complications after short labor. I could ever figure out why everyone was so scared I was going to lose the baby.\n\nBack to trying for baby number two: I first noticed the issues when I began having irregular bleeding. I didnt think much of it at first, because I was so pumped to not have bad cramps anymore, like they were pre-baby. (At one point I puked and passed out in the bathroom at high school because I was in so much pain) I eventually went to see a doctor, who said there wasnothing physically wrong, but offered a hysteroscopy or a hystorectomy to solve my irregular bleeding. I was terrified, and convinced myself I didnt need a doctors help, and never went back. \n\n3 years later, after too many rounds of playing \"Am I pregnant or not?\" with my emotions and a miscarriage in April, I finally booked an appointment with an OB-GYN to find out why I wasnt getting pregnant. Again, before examining me, he announced that it was one of three things: I was too fat, I had PCOS, or it was my husbands fault. My world was shaken, but I was determined to have another child, so when he instructed me to go home and look up what PCOS was, I did. I started exercising more, changed my diet, and began looking into natural remedies for PCOS while doing tests for this doctor. My husband went and got himself tested as well. After my results were in, I was informed I in fact did NOT have PCOS, and the doctor asked me why I was surprised... He informed me I had \"Unexplained Infertility\". I should have walked away then and there. He booked me for an HSG in a town 2 and a half hours away, explaining he couldnt do the test in the city. He again instructed me to go home and look up what an HSG was, and I would see him at this hospital for the procedure. November 27, 2012, I had the HSG done by a doctor I had never met before, and afterward was pulled into a tiny change room where my OB GYN told me that most women get pregnant after this procedure within three months, and that again, there was nothing physically wrong with me so he didnt know why I couldnt gt pregnant. Well, I didnt get my period for 4 months. I never went back to that doctor.\n\nI found myself a different doctor who was great, but he was just a GP, and fertility stuff made him uncomfortable, but he was willing to check my hormone levels and thyroid, and refer me to a fertility clinic. I was grateful, and he did discover I was suffering from severe anemia. Finally, a possible answer! Unfortunately it took a year and 3 months to get into the clinic. \n\nWhich brings me to now, and the reason I have so much hate for doctors. I adore my fertility specialist, despite what she has put me through. I have had a second HSG, an Endo Biopsy, an AFC count, a million blood tests, and I am now scheduled for an SIS. It took six and a half years, and I dont know how many doctors to find out that I not only have a tilted uterus, but also a Partial Bicorunate (Heart Shaped) uterus. This is one of the PRIMARY reasons why I havent been able to get pregnant (waiting back on yet another PCOS test). The malformation of my uterus is why doctors were so worried about me losing the baby the first time. Why on earth wold a doctor NOT inform me of these things?? Ive been tormenting myself for years thinking I had done something wrong, suffering through rage and bitterness at pregnant women, feeling guilty for wanting more than one child when I have frends who cant even have one baby, only to find out that its mostly because my uterus didnt form correctly. It makes me so sad and angry. I wish all doctors were as thorough as my specialist, and I hope with all my heart that THIS doctor will at least be able to give me an answer other than \"There is nothing physically wrong with you\".", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New to this stuff.

I'm brand new to this subreddit, but not new to infertility. It took us 4+ years to conceive #1 and we've decided to give an honest go to conceive #2 which means we're back to the land of infertility. I made the appointment last month and the past few days I've been feeling \"blah\" for no reason- It occurred to me tonight that my mood is likely due to the fact that I'm remembering what it is I'm getting myself into- the tests, the frustrations, the shots, the heartbreak, the worry, etc... I really honestly thought that after we had 1 child, I'd be done and never ever go this route again. I'm really not sure how I went from \"I'm perfectly happy with one!\" to \"I need to go through this emotional and physical torment again.\" But in any case, I got here... Here I am.\n\nNext month is my appointment to see my new nurse. We have zero REs in my state, and this nurse comes highly recommended. She's an infertility patient herself which calms me because she understands. I have PCOS, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and low progesterone/estrogen dominance. I've been seeing a nurse who specializes in hormones and she has me on a regimen that is, miraculously, working for me. My cycles have been irregular and long (46+ days) for as long as I can remember but the past several months, I'm down to 31-33 day cycles (unheard of for me!), though we haven't had any luck conceiving on our own. When we had an RE in the state, she had me do femara, follistim, ovidrel, crinone, and timed intercourse. I had two 15mm follicles on CD 12, went home and did two more days of follistim then triggered. That cycle didn't work and before we could try with that RE again, she had moved out of state. I'm wondering if my nurse will follow a similar plan (plus an IUI).\n\nAnyways, I don't have any women in my life to talk to about infertility who have first hand experience with it. Well meaning people say stupid, hurtful things so I just don't bring these topics up around \"civilians\" anymore. I love that here, I'm understood and nobody will ever tell me to stop trying so hard and it will happen when the time is right.

While on progesterone, it's been day 11 and 12.\n\nAdditionally, when my fertility tracking app indicates when I would usually start my period (but don't b/c of the progesterone), I notice that my cervix is really high like I'm having my actual period but nothing is coming out. It then goes back to really low after a couple days. I also experience period like pulling cramps, like I have a tampon in when my cervix is high.\n\nSo - has anyone else noticed this? Am I crazy?
