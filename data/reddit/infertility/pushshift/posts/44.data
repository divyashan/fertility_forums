Ever since we got engaged, his now sister in law has been on a mission to upstage our ever step. We got engaged and picked a wedding date. They got engaged 2 months later and picked a date 8 weeks before our wedding. They had only been together about a year and a half at that point. She then spent all of our wedding showing my husbands family pictures of their wedding and honeymoon. Shockingly, I didn't kill her or even say anything about how insanely insensitive that was. His Brother always said that they wanted to wait a few years before having a baby. So naturally she \"accidentally\" got pregnant a week after our wedding and announced it to us all on Christmas. They have always maintained that it was unplanned. Maybe he didn't plan it but I definitely think she did. So fine. No big deal, except my husband and I didn't want to wait for children. We have been trying for awhile with little to no success. We had a positive test a few days before Mother's day. They had planned a gender reveal party for that day, you know because it was her first mother's day. I of course got my period that morning. I have done my best to keep on a happy face, I am actually happy for them, just sad for us. Side note, my Husband and I picked out baby names before we were even married. We never told anyone but would always talk about our future children by this one name. We sort of made him this person in our minds. So they had their kid yesterday and guess what they named him. Yeah, our name. Granted, there is no way that they could have known it was the name we had picked out but it was a real sting. We went to the hospital and everyone was over the moon about the first grandchild, a thing that we will never be able to experience, the amazing name (it was a very sentimental family name) and how perfect everything was turning out for them. I am adult enough to know that it is not this bitty babies fault. So I held him and essential had a total crying melt down.  I know we will have our small human someday, I hope but man has this been hard.

I have said this repeatedly, but I know almost nothing about the terminology involved in IF, so I struggle with how to discuss my medical history in any kind of cognizant way. Among other things but maybe the most frustrating, I struggle with significant brain fog as an effect of fibromyalgia. It's extremely exasperating. \n\nI will try to keep this short and sweet, but you can look back at my post history for details if you'd like. \n\nI had the worst ObGyn for forever, who did things like not tell me when my STI tests came back positive from a cheating partner or recommend treatment, downplay then suddenly play up potential cancer diagnosis but refuse to give me a referral, and was overall horridly judgey about my attempts at fertility with my ex-husband.\n\nFast forward to now. I started a new job a couple of months ago, and have new insurance as a result, that covers a big Ole zilch for infertility care of any kind at all. Except... I talked to my Dr last week (an awesome ObGyn) about how my other Dr's want me to start treatment at the end of the year that means I'll not get another chance to reproduce if I don't do something yesterday. She thinks if I start now, I might get a shot at treatment (retrieval and freezing) before I lose the ability for good. \n\nHere's the catch: my previous sucky Dr's office says they no longer have my medical records available for transfer to my new doc, but if I can \"prove\" recurrent loss, new Dr can get my insurance to cover some bits and pieces of preparation and testing to determine if I'm a candidate for storage until later (if later is ever a thing, GC, etc. I don't know, I haven't thought that far ahead yet.).\n\nThe problem for me is that since sucky Dr never really explained anything to me nor did I know what questions to ask, and essentially my only source of education on my body is google, I am trying to piece together a \"formal\" medical history with like nothing to go on but a very foggy memory (hence the question in yesterday's daily).\n\nSo, here's my bid for support: would one or two of you be willing to let me pester the crap out of your PM inbox while I sort through this paperwork? I know that stupid noob questions can get a little thick around here, and don't wanna be \"that guy\", but I'm not sure where else to turn. I will absolutely do my homework best I can, but sometimes I don't even know where to start with Google. \n\nI know it's a lot to ask, but it would mean the world to me for what that's worth. \ud83d\udc9b", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Reconstructing Medical Records from Memory...This is getting ridiculous.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6lqll7/reconstructing_medical_records_from_memorythis_is/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "neptopium", "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "39F, Adhesions, unexplained RPL, waiting on FET for DE+GC", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1499394815, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6lqr8b/has_anyone_else_suspected_a_mitochondria_issue/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6lqr8b", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6lqr8b/has_anyone_else_suspected_a_mitochondria_issue/", "retrieved_on": 1502075822, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Our RE brought this up last year as a possible reason for our recurrent euploid miscarriages.

Once I get the details out I'll leave them out in future posts. I'm sorry. \n\nHonestly, I'm not sure where I belong. I don't want to intrude on people that have been through so much, but I just don't like the feeling I get from the other subs. I've been in the tfab sub for a while now, as we're at cycle 14.... but there's so much cutesy crap over there that it's starting to just make me so angry. \n\nChecked out the stilltrying... same feeling. I really don't want to bother anyone but I don't know where to share my frustrations and my sadness that just gets harder month after month. Cycle after cycle. I'm 29, I'll be 30 in October. My husband is 38. (Trigger warning) he has 3 boys from his first marriage, 17 13 and 7.  The ironic part is that our doctor has us pegged at male factor infertility right now. \n\nI've never had one, I've never even had the hint of a line. No miscarriages that I know of, no chemical no nothing. I've had previous long term monogamous relationships before my husband, with years of unprotected intercourse, nothing. \n\nSo his numbers are right under the low end of normal. If I can beat lifestyle changes into him, and the next urologist we see has anything useful to say (the first one was a useless dolt), I think his problems will be ok. Obviously his junk worked before. But I think then we'll be back for more testing for me. I've had hormone testing and a vitamin D deficiency, waiting for the results after 12 weeks of ergocalciferol. Had an HSG, came back \"normal\". Very detailed explanation from the doctor. \nI have a hard time believing it's all my husband. I've wanted a baby my entire life. I've been tracking my cycles for years. Ovulation predictors for the last 2 years. The first year and a half of our relationship we weren't trying not to, and we hit plenty of cycles then too. Still nothing. I'm just starting to feel hopeless, and stuck and like nothing will ever work. I think it's even harder with male factor because I can't change his diet. I can't make him exercise. I can't do anything. We have been actively trying for the last year, and I know many of you have been at it for much longer and I'm so sorry. I don't want to intrude. I just feel so sad and so alone and don't feel like I belong anywhere. \n\nMy husband has had a semen analysis from his regular doctor, that got him a referral to a urologist. He repeated the analysis one month later and the number were maybe 2 mil higher. Still below normal. Manually checked for varicocele, did some basic bloodwork, testosterone was in range. Most things looked blood wise basically normal, just the semen quantity quality and motility. That urologist decided there was nothing else for him he could do. What a waste of time. We ended up having a joint appointment with my gynecologist nurse lady, as I have a long track record of abnormal paps and colposcopies for ascus/can not rule out high grade. So that's been miserable for the last 3 years. That mess started maybe 4 months before I met my husband. Maybe summer 2013, 2014? I think. \n\nSorry for the wall of text. I tried not to break any sub rules... sorry for the triggers I'm sorry for everything I just don't know who to talk to anymore and crying on my dogs is good I guess but they don't know what a colposcopy is or what it feels like to have a catheter in their uterus or why I cry on them every month because all I get is endless cheerfulness from my husband.

There are a few concerns that we want to be mindful of with this sub going private:\n\n**1. Lurkers:** We know that lurkers sometimes benefit from our vast knowledge of the desolate landscape of bullshit that is infertility. We do not want to deprive anyone of this! More importantly, we know that some r/infertility users have relationships with Senior Class members and that those non-SC members would enjoy being able to keep track of our goings on.\n\nSo, we propose that users of the main sub, with a minimum of 6 months of very active post history can apply for lurking membership. Please message the mods with some details about yourself and your history if you think you meet the lurker membership guidelines. **These lurkers will not be allowed to post or comment in our dailies or threads.**There is no mechanism to prevent them from doing so, so we will be relying on the honour system and our members will be reporting those who break the rules to ensure the community rules are adhered to. \n\n*Not all lurkers will necessarily be approved - we reserve the right to reject lurkers without active post histories, who do not have any proven history of positive, frequent contributions and/or are unknown to us (meaning we can't determine from your history if you meet this criteria) or with a history of bad behaviour on the main sub to protect our members*\n\n**Approved lurkers who do not abide by the no posting/commenting rule will be swiftly banned.** We ask that approved members use the report feature and/or message the mods if they see a post from an unfamiliar name so we can check to make sure everyone is respecting our rules.\n\n**2. Membership.** The same membership rules will still apply for posting/commenting privileges. 1 year of active commenting/posting history on the main sub, a diagnosis of infertility and an established treatment history with multiple interventions.\n\nWe know that there are some who feel excluded by the Senior Class and main sub split. Our going private is not intended to exclude. Rather, it was a decision made by the majority in our group to better protect the community that is so important to us. \n\nThank you all.\n\n\n\nEdited to take out \"relationship\" which was causing some interpretation issues. Hopefully it is more clear now.  \n\n\n\nTo clarify: the new lurker status guidelines were made after feedback from those who were already lurkers on the sub. We hoped that we were finding a happy medium in doing so. Fundamentally, this rule is merely making explicit what was already in place, but because the sub is going private we have had to adjust and lurkers will need to request access to view it, hence the clarifying of those rules.

I've commented my story before, but I've never made a standalone post. I (28/F) was medically retired from the Navy in 2014 after developing UC (diagnosed in 2012) and needing a total colectomy in 2013. I have a permanent ileostomy (stoma, poop bag), and I'm *really* happy I had the procedure! I hadn't responded well to any medications which means I was in an active flare for over a year (running to the bathroom up to 20-30 times a day, pooping myself in the car and at work and sometimes even at home, anemic from blood loss, lack of period due to extreme weight loss and heavy steroid doses, etc...the list goes on and on). The relief after waking up from the procedure (ignoring the trapped air and general pain from being opened up and half gutted) was immense! So, anyway, life with the bag is good.\n\nHaving said that, I did have complications afterwards. They managed to damage my bladder while in there, and I also developed a large abscess inside my abdominal cavity that ended up needing a drain to be inserted deep inside (through my butt cheek) in order to heal. There was basically a lot of trauma to my pelvic area from both the disease and the colectomy, unfortunately.\n\nMy SO (34/M) and I have been trying since 2016 to get pregnant. We experienced one very early loss late last year, but nothing since then. I began having chronic pelvic pain earlier this year that felt sort of like a UTI, so my doctor referred me to a gynecologist and a urologist. Both ordered ultrasounds and CT scans, and this is where my hydrosalpinx was discovered. My regular doctor wanted a more detailed view of the tube, so she ordered an MRI with contrast. Gyno threw in CD3 panel for the fun of it, and she reported that my LH and FSH were \"flipped\" which may indicate PCOS, but she wasn't willing to diagnose me with it just yet. Radiology reports all came back that my right tube is indeed blocked and filled with fluid, and there may be some endometriosis. So, we were referred to an RE \"out in town\" (so far, everything had been taken care of at our local VA hospital). Today was our first time meeting the RE, and what she told us really surprised me.\n\nTHE NITTY GRITTY...\n\nI was under the assumption that my tube would need to be dealt with surgically in order to have any chance of success with fertility in the future because of the fluid impeding implantation. However, because of my history of pelvic surgeries and complications, she told us that she wants to leave the hydrosalpinx alone and go straight to IVF (she also suspects that scar tissue may be impeding my left tube from reaching my left ovary in order to pick up anything after ovulation). She mentioned the Essure coil that could be placed inside the tube to block it, but she feels strongly that it would likely cause further complications that would create a need for more pelvic surgery...which is what she feels needs to be avoided at this time.\n\nShe ordered a few more tests for me before she makes her final recommendation (saline sonohysterogram, CD5-CD11 ultrasounds), but she sounded so optimistic about our chances even if we leave the tube in place. I have a very high AMH, and SO's SA came back with great results. Despite all of that, I can't shake this feeling that this tube with its fluid is going to screw up our implantation and possibly put me at an increased risk of miscarriages even IF the IVF procedure(s) work(s).\n\nI plan to press her a bit more about her clinic's success with leaving hydros in place and if she plans to aspirate the fluid before transfers and things like that, but I was curious to see if anyone here had any advice or is possibly in a similar situation (trying to conceive with hydrosalpinx/salpinges being left in place). I am kind of dreading going through a cycle with the ups and downs and costs just to have embryos washed out by my messed up anatomy...\n\nI think I will x-post this to /r/infertilitybabies", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "We're Feeling a Bit Thrown Off", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6m24o5/were_feeling_a_bit_thrown_off/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "ApolloBollo", "author_created_utc": 1367762933, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "32, 2 years TTC, 1 MC", "author_fullname": "t2_bkgvx", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1499534642, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6m27hq/tell_me_im_not_absurdmiscarriagedc_mentioned/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6m27hq", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 34, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6m27hq/tell_me_im_not_absurdmiscarriagedc_mentioned/", "retrieved_on": 1502081474, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "For those of y'all who don't know my story here is a quick refresh -- TTC since May 2015. Had MMC at 3 months in March 2016. We've done months of Femara, months of Clomid, IUI...etc. We had our first RE appointment in April 2017.\n\nSo, here is where I keep questioning myself. When we met with the RE a few months ago in April I was way amped about him. I thought, \"heck yeah! We're gonna get a plan! I love plans! Mr.ApolloBollo also loves plans! PLANS!!\" And instead we spoke to the Twat Waffle for an hour about how, \"maybe it's your Crohns\" (it isn't...it isn't even bad Crohn's) or, \"maybe it is your Jewy-ness\" (that ain't it either, I've had genetic testing done). And then he said something that really just went right under my skin like a papercutting splinter. He read the results of the Pathology from my D&amp;C and read the one sentence that has stuck with me since the day I saw the report, \"fetal tissue is not identified......\" It gets me right in the gut every time because when we went in for our three month (and our first) ultrasound I know exactly what I saw -- we both know what we saw -- a little tiny miniature version of what a baby looks like on an ultrasound. Clear as day. And when I read that report it made me feel like I was being told it wasn't as big a deal as it was - and I know logically that isn't it, but still. It hurt. And when he said that it just sucked the air out of me and made me feel stupid close to losing my shit for no good reason. \n\nBut, me being the master of emotion that I am --- I didn't tell Mr. ApolloBollo about that until a month or so ago. And I explained why I didn't want to see him again, and he told me how he's 100% fine with that. That if I didn't click with him, for whatever reason, we can see someone else. So, I made an appointment based on a recommendation with a new guy. We see him on Monday. And I'm way amped. But I know he'll ask if we've seen someone before and I'm kinda certain he'll ask why we're not there anymore. And I just feel silly to say, \"cause he read a pathology report that upset me\". \n\nAm I being totally irrational? Crazy? Justified?

Husband's SA wasn't great - 14mil count and 2% morphology. HSG showed my tubes were clear. \n\nI was told to take coq10 to improve my egg quality, so I've been popping those like Skittles. They didn't tell my husband to take anything - in fact, they acted like his numbers were hardly a problem at all - but I put him on a zinc/folic acid regimen. I think the vitamins have helped him a little bit. His post-wash counts were 17mil and 16 mil for the IUIs.\n\nOur RE recommended starting with IUI since we're so young. First cycle was in April. One mature follicle, perfect lining, no success. Second cycle was in June. Three mature follicles, perfect lining again, still no success. We did Femara, Gonal-F and Ovidrel with each, and I responded well even with the doses being super low. \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure I want to do another IUI. I already ovulate on my own and my cycles are extremely predictable, so that hasn't been our problem. The RE told us that with my high-ish FSH, our odds of success would be somewhat lower than the clinic's 20% average. So another month or two of IUIs doesn't seem worth it if I'm only looking at a 10% chance of success each time.\n\nThere's also the issue of insurance coverage. I'm very lucky that my insurance does cover a portion of our IF treatments, but the IUIs are already eating into the lifetime maximum. I feel like that's money we could be putting toward IVF. \n\nAnybody have any insight on how to proceed from here? Should we go for one or two more IUIs since I respond so well? Or should our RE have even recommended it considering we both have kinda shitty test results?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is another IUI worth it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6m2isr/is_another_iui_worth_it/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1499538951, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6m2mdc/saturday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6m2mdc", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 65, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6m2mdc/saturday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1502081678, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

We knew walking in that IVF was pretty certain, and we weren't disappointed! My AFC was 3! Wonderful!

I am pretty sure that the AFC means IVF will be a nonstarter for us, but maybe I'm overthinking/overreacting. Ive had a lot of emotions in the last 24 hours around the improbability of having a biological child, and we did bring up the idea of donor embryos to him (our clinic doesn't do have a large inventory). Who knows at this point? I plan for the worst case, which has served me well in getting to this point without any big fits. I think I'm due for one.\n\nAlthough we have only been trying for 6 months, we have been ready for awhile.

I don't have many close friends anymore for many reasons. Mostly, they all moved after college, mostly pretty far distances, so we see each other once a year, if even. I'm also fairly introverted, so I'm kinda bad at socializing unless I'm comfortable or have the mental bandwidth at the moment, which doesn't happen that often these days. Almost ALL of my friends have children, and my sister has children as well, which obviously gets you left out. Places I'd otherwise meet friends are work, and all my co-workers my age are hardcore hockey/dance/football/etc moms with really not much in common with anyone childless, nor time to forge friendships, and the rest are grandparent age. My sister and I are tight, and I adore my nieces with reckless, cool naughty aunt abandon, and they love me and my husband tons. My mom and sister have really, truly dropped the ball on me in recent months. While they somewhat appear supportive, they basically try to ignore my situation nowadays, almost like they're tired of hearing about it.( I don't talk about it that much, but I have ranted a few times) All I get is generic platitudes about how  they \"know it'll work out\" and etc. I know it upsets them as they know how hard it's been, and some of it is not knowing what to say I'm sure... My mom and I have a strained relationship at the best of times, but we're working on it now that she's in much needed therapy, so my expectations from her aren't super high. My sister though, I'm pretty hurt by, and I don't know if I have a right. Every visit to her house is VERY kid-centric. I'm fine if its my nieces, because I LOVE THEM SO MUCH and am a giant, insane kid. But my sister has a million mama bear type friends, and they're constantly around with their 3-4 children. Maybe it's selfish of me to say, hey, I don't see you guys that often, can it just be us? So I don't dare, I'm just uncomfortable and pissy because I can't even hang with my family then and I see them every 3-4 months, and they see their friends literally every day. I wanted to take my nieces to the zoo like previous summers, and my sister said was going with her group of friends and kids, so I didn't even try to include myself. My husband said he'd take me to the zoo, and I started crying saying we'd seem like weirdos and I didn't wanna stare at all the happy families staring at the fucking monkeys ( I accept this is irrational) It makes me feel like shit, like pouty bitch with few friends or support in real life. My childfree friends travel constantly, so they're super hard to hang with. I've tried to get some sister time in solo too, and told her I wanted to go on a trip this summer. She instead is flying out for the second time to help her friend with her newest 4th baby, which naturally chapped my ass good. I'm like super, your sister is having the roughest patch of her adult life and would like to go get drunk with you on a beach somewhere, but you'd rather go babysit for someone across country? that sounds WAAAYYYY more fun... ;/ I asked them months ago to pick a weekend to come this summer and she never did, now they're busy the rest of the summer. She text me today telling me she and her friends (between the 4 of them have like  over 15 kids and 3 are brand new moms) will be down in a few weeks if I want to hang with them. Um, so you can all talk about how much of a break you need from diapers and screaming kids? No thanks.  Sigh. I'm looking into classes for exercise or projects where I can meet people. I really don't care if people have kids at all, but if they have no personality other than being a mom, we don't have much in common....

Two days ago I still had a faint positive from my HCG trigger. I planned to test again this morning (CD 28), and was feeling hopeful the line would be darker. I usually cramp terribly right before I start, and I had only had a few minor cramps. Of course, I woke up at 5 am to pee and realized I was bleeding. So cycle 20 became cycle 21. Also, I turned 32 a couple days ago. \n\nHusband woke up around 7 and I told him. Despite our plans to work around the house today (we're in the middle of a major landscaping overhaul), he told me to stay in bed and we could do whatever I wanted whenever I was ready to get up. I gave myself a few hours to read in bed and feel sad, and then I decided getting out of the house would do me some good. So we go out to lunch and to walk around some shops. Who are we seated next to at lunch? If you guessed a couple with newborn twins, you get a gold star. I didn't realize until we were already seated, or I would have asked for another table. I faced away from them, but the baby coos and baby talk from the new parents was like nails on a chalkboard to me. Then I felt bad for feeling that way, but holy shit was I grateful when they left. \n\nSo now I'm thinking about the next few weeks, wondering if my RE will suggest moving on to IUI, and wondering if it's time for me to suggest it. This was my 4th medicated cycle. The first two were femara only, the third was femara + hcg trigger, and this last cycle was femara, menopur, and trigger.

We had success on our first round, and since trying for over a year again, we've had a 2 failed FET, one ectopic, one failed IVF, One IVF giving us a day 3 transfer fail, and waiting on our only frozen embryo to try. \n\nI have a normal/good AMH but am a very poor responder. \n\nI had thoughts that maybe we can do smaller doses of stim meds, enough to get me one or two follicles on my attached side, then trigger shot and IUI. He's never suggested trying this, and I don't know if it's silly to even try or not. When stimming for our most recent IVF, I had many decent sized follicles on that side, and know I can grow them. \n\nMy other thought is that maybe I can wait to take ovulation meds a bit later in my cycle (I have VERY long cycles, and can reach day 30-50 without any signs of ovulation). I heard this on a forum somewhere as a thought for those who don't seem to have regular cycles. \n\nHe's over cautious about the possibility of multiples, and has been very reluctant to try anything that would give us that chance. \n\nWhat would you do?\n\nWe have a second opinion consult with a different clinic on July 20th, in which I will ask whether these are options to try. At this point in time, I don't think I'm willing to do another round of IVF, because our retrieval was the most excruciating experience I have had to date. \n\nI know this is a weird flow of my thoughts, I hope it makes sense.

The pregnancy outcome of 212 embryo transfer cycles (64 gestational carriers) was reviewed according to the origin of the embryo. The number of retrieved oocytes was significantly higher following COH (n\u2009=\u2009132) compared with IVM (n\u2009=\u200958) and MNC cycles (n\u2009=\u200962) (p\u2009=\u20090.013 and p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001, respectively). Pregnancy rates for embryos transferred according to each protocol were similar. All pregnancies that ended in live births when oocytes from IVM cycles were used derived from transfers of retrieved mature and mixed mature and immature oocytes. Pregnancies that involved embryos derived solely from immature oocytes that further matured in vitro and were transferred to gestational carriers were unsuccessful.\n\nConclusions\n\nMNC protocol is a good option to achieve pregnancy for intended mothers using gestational surrogacy who have contraindications to COH. The yield of IVM cycles in which immature oocytes are retrieved is inconclusive.\n\nKeywords\n\nGestational surrogate Intended mothers In vitro maturation Modified natural cycle \nCapsule\n\nA modified natural cycle protocol is suitable for women for whom controlled ovarian stimulation is contraindicated. The yield of in vitro maturation cycles with retrieval of immature oocytes is unclear.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Sunday Topic: Protocols", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6m9s3y/journal_club_sunday_topic_protocols/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "benihanacumberbatch", "author_created_utc": 1464890233, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "36M+34F |UNEXP|2 IUI| 4 IVFs | PGD | 2 FET", "author_fullname": "t2_yek73", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1499632484, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6m9sg3/chat/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6m9sg3", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6m9sg3/chat/", "retrieved_on": 1502085213, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "There was a suggestion that we try the chat room a bit more.\n\nUsually weekends are pretty quiet here, but it seems this weekend, there are more people 'around'.\n\nSo go ahead, click on the link (I don't think you need to register or anything, just type in your username so we know who you are)\n\nhttp://webchat.snoonet.org/infertility\n\nI'll stay in there for a bit.

It's probable that what I have to say is highly influenced by that. \n\nSince there have been some discussion about secondary infertility, I thought I might want to share a different perspective-- as an actual only child. I should probably xpost this over on secondary infertility, but I just can't spend a single moment over there for my own reasons. That and from what I\u2019ve heard its a pretty quiet sub reddit.\n\nI'm an only child. My parents struggled (for different reasons than my own) to have me. They attempted to keep their troubles a secret because they never wanted me to feel like I wasn't enough for them in their lives. It probably was a great plan. Except, other adults always had a running commentary. Some people just plain outed them by making off the cuff comments about how I would just have to 'fulfill all of their hopes and dreams' or some such nonsense. However, mostly I (a child, mind you) just overheard a ton of various (unfounded) insensitive statements like \u2018Only children are X' ... where X can be: Spoiled, used to getting your own way, over sensitive, unable to have good peer relations, etc.. Its actually pretty horrible to find out you were 'ruined' by nothing you personally ever caused to happen. \n\nAs an adult (for the most part) I'm fine. I've talked with many friends who are also only children and I don't think my experience is unusual. Yeah, its scary thinking about being the only one who take care of your aging parents, but I'm certain that there are many people with siblings who feel the same way. If I had the chance, would I have opted for siblings? Depends on which day you ask me.\n\nIt's very painful for me to hear people who suffer from secondary infertility talk about the emotional damage they are doing their children by not being able to have just one. I am in no way discounting your own personal pain about feeling that your family is incomplete, but please, don't assume that you are doing harm by only having 1. Many of us only children will gladly tell you that the harm is from feeling like we aren't enough or are ruined by not having siblings. Things written on the internet have a permanence that casually spoken comments do not. If I ever read something that my parents wrote about negative feelings about only having 1 child, I\u2019d be devastated. \n\nPS: Yes, I know that as a member of r/infertility I have had my less than kind moments. I can't and don't expect all the comments to be loving and supportive to what I have written. I'm okay with criticism. I\u2019m especially okay with it if it makes 1 person pause before writing I feel like I have completed what I set out to do when I made this post.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Infertility from an only child's perspective", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6m9vo2/infertility_from_an_only_childs_perspective/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "learning_hillzz", "author_created_utc": 1479698675, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "27, DOR, IVF#1, Since 06/16", "author_fullname": "t2_12ylpo", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1499639458, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1499640354, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6mag98/menopur_or_low_dose_hcg/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6mag98", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 13, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6mag98/menopur_or_low_dose_hcg/", "retrieved_on": 1502085539, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'll be starting my first IVF cycle soon, and was told that the doctor would be using either menopur or low-dose HCG.

Polotsky, A.A. Allshouse, S. Krawetz, N. Santoro, E. Eisenberg, H. Zhang, M.P. Diamond\n\n\n\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2015.07.238\n\n\nObjective\n\n\nCouples with unexplained infertility often seek advice on lifestyle changes but evidence-based medicine is limited. We sought to determine the impact of male body mass on the chance of pregnancy and live birth after fertility treatment.\n\nDesign\n\n\nSecondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial (1).\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\n900 couples with unexplained infertility were randomized to ovulation induction with gonadotropins, or letrozole, or clomiphene citrate, followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI) for up to 4 cycles. \n\nFemales were 18-40 years old, had regular menses , at least 1 patent fallopian tube, normal uterine cavity and a male partner with at least 5 million total motile sperm (TMS) count. \n\nAnalysis was limited to subjects for whom complete male partner information was available (n=836). \n\nLogistic regression was conducted with clinical pregnancy and live birth as the outcomes. \n\nEach model was adjusted for male and female body mass index (BMI), treatment arm, and TMS.\n\nResults\n\n\nTwo hundred and forty-five couples achieved clinical pregnancy (29.3%) and 214 women had a live birth (25.6%) in our analytic sample. \n\nPrimary trial results have been presented (2). 272 male partners were obese with BMI greater than 30 k/m2 (32.5%) and 134 couples were concordant for male and female obesity (16.2%). \n\n\nOverall, there was a significant but very weak inverse correlation between male BMI and TMS (rho=-0.08, p=0.02) and a significant and moderate positive correlation between male and female BMI (rho=0.41, p &lt;0.01). \n\nMultivariable analysis indicated that treatment was less likely to be successful in couples with male obesity.\n\n\nConclusions\n\n\nIn the AMIGOS trial, male obesity decreased the likelihood of live birth after fertility treatment by 40% as compared to couples with normal male weight. \n\nThis effect was seen independent of female obesity, treatment arm and sperm parameters. Patients with unexplained infertility should be informed that obesity in the male partner reduces success of fertility treatment.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.Diamond et al.

I am totally ranting and expressing all of my emotions today, and don't want to hurt/offend/upset anyone. \n\nI'm not sure what happened. I'm currently stimming for my 15th egg retrieval - and all the rage and anger and bitterness that I worked really hard to avoid has just overcome me today. We've been doing this for 5 years, unexplained infertility, 5 miscarriages. From this whole process, I've gone from:\n\nBeing cute/fit&gt;40lbs overweight\nBright and promising career&gt;quitting my job\nSocial and outgoing&gt;voluntarily isolated and alone\nLoving &amp; adoring my husband&gt;despising him when I'm stimming\nBeing a confident person&gt;being horribly insecure\nBeing happy go lucky&gt;struggling with depression/therapy\n\nI can't get over how when infertility happens, most of the loss is on the woman's side. Men can drink and do as they please. We have to diet and avoid all carbs and basically yummy things in life in order to increase our chances of conceiving. There are countless shots and scans and waiting at the doctor's office, while my husband just comes in one day to jack off. I also resent my husband because I told him I didn't want to have kids, and he convinced me that he didn't want any either, just to change after we got married. \n\nI'm just SO SO ANGRY, and even more so now because we have moved on to surrogacy. I'm angry I will never be able to experience pregnancy. I'm angry that I feel ashamed for not being able to carry a baby. I'm angry that people keep telling me to fucking adopt even though they have no idea how much money and time goes into it. I'm angry that people just don't see my struggle as a real problem, but a privileged lifestyle choice. I'm angry that all of the money we've poured into it and moving we did to get the best treatment was all for fucking nothing. I'm angry that my Dad passed this year, and then I miscarried at home. All of the bitterness is truly engulfing me. I just don't even know what to do anymore. \n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who sent me hugs or commiserated with me - as I read all the comments, I started crying because I know you all understand what I'm going through, and each of us is struggling along in this awful journey.

I had sent him the Mayo Clinic page on MFI \"Preparing for your appointment\". I first asked if my husband had answers to the questions. He admitted the only one he didn't know was the details of his brother's S.A. Luckily my SIL was very forthcoming about their fertility struggles due to her PCOS. She did advise me they were out of pocket and never did a formal S.A., but her husband's stats post wash for all 4 of their IUI's was \"good enough\". She did, however, confirm they'd gone to IUI  not only because of her PCOS, but also for unexplained fertility. So I was happy to advise my husband on how to answer that.  \nI then took the opening to point out that the Mayo article advised bringing your spouse in case surgery or intervention for conception comes up. I had called the clinic earlier and they said partners often come but are not required. I didn't mention that to my husband but laid my case that if intervention is needed, my presence would be helpful since the intervention will have more physical impact on me. I also used the tip to mention that if he didn't bring me I'd basically make him recount the meeting word for word. And I agreed to step out for the physical exam.  \nI then asked why he didn't want me to come. He didn't mention the physical exam, but did say he wanted an appointment of him and his doctor, with no one speaking for him. I do have a habit of doing this sometimes. I told him if I did it too much he could ask me to leave.  \nSo now I've got a husband who says \"fine, come if you want\" and expect a tough appointment where this chatty Cathy needs to keep her mouth shut.

This subreddit was recommended to me by a friend as I'm finding myself pretty lost in this process.  I've been snooping around here for a while, have found many threads both hysterical (in a very positive way) and productive. I finally have the guts enough to post\u2026 not sure if I'm doing this right, but here it goes:\n\nHow personal or impersonal is your RE/fertility clinic?  Do you talk to a team that knows you/your case, or is it more triage-like and whoever is available calls you back/sees you for follow ups?\n\nHere\u2019s why I ask\u2026I'm at a major hospital's fertility clinic.  I have a doctor that is \"mine\", but I see that doctor rarely. It\u2019s a rotating circus of doctors and nurses. If I have question, rarely if at all the person calling me back know anything about me.  As a real-time example, Sunday AM, I had an ultrasound, and the doctor (whom I\u2019ve never met before) mid-scan says very curiously, \u201chmmm. It would appear you had a large cyst\u2026\u201d  No effing shit, sherlock. If you literally read the very last entry of my file before you walked in the room you'd have seen that.  The cyst is why I had the scan scheduled, to see if it was gone/find out where I am in my cycle, talk about when the next IUI can happen (pending blood test results of course), etc.   Then yesterday, a nurse called to tell me they won\u2019t prescribe me provera because Day 1 \u201cshould be any day now\u201d \u2013 then I said, well my extremely irregular cycles average 75 days, did you know that? She had no idea, and then wrote the RX. Shouldn\u2019t she have read my file? Known that before making any decision about me? I have so many examples of me having to educate and reeducate nurses/doctors about me.\n\nIs this impersonal experience normal? Are fertility clinics all that impersonal or is this just a side effect of being at a giant, teaching hospital?  I'm not expecting to have someone memorize my case - I absolutely get it; they have tons of patients. But, I've had no consistent coverage AT ALL. I\u2019ve seen no less than a dozen doctors in 20 months and lord knows how many nurses (who are not just support, but are giving me direction/making decisions about my care), and none seem to know the totality of my case (one didn't even know I had had the IUI...). I'm working on getting a second opinion/moving elsewhere, but if I just need to suck it up because this is norm, then I won't go through the annoyance of finding a new clinic.
