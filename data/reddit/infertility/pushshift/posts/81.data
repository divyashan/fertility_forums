My husband is 17 years older than me and had an injury to the testicle about 23/24 years ago which has resulted in very low sperm counts. Fast forward to today, get the semen analysis results, very low sperm counts despite being on treatment for the last 3 months to boost testosterone levels to raise the sperm counts. Granted, from the first analysis to this analysis, we are seeing improvement. However, not any where close to what we were hoping for.\n\nThe issue: my spouse had been on hormone replacement therapy for the last 3 years and made the decision to stop taking them so we can try having a baby together. A huge sacrifice, and resulted in many emotional ups/downs and numerous arguments. My spouse has been dealing with this since the age of 4 and has a really hard time coping at times.\n\nThe purposed plan: the doctor is recommending seeing a urologist, stay on Clomid and get on Conception XR and hcG shots. I have read that the Conception XR is just basically a multivitamin that actually made some sperm analysis results worse. The doctor wants us to do this for the next 3 months before redoing the sperm analysis and determining between IUI and IVF.\n\nThe Question: My spouse has already made such a sacrifice and has been feeling like after everything, it might not be worth it because essentially the progress is going backwards from where my spouse wants to be. Is undergoing hcG shots for the next 3 months actually worth it? We both feel very conflicted on what to do, and my main question is whether other couples have been successful going on this route to conceive naturally or should we just seek IVF?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14142, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Debate of Treatments", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566261427, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/crf512/the_debate_of_treatments/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Available_Answer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "34F, MTHFR, IUI#1 Failed...straight on to IVF in OCT", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_32m6czjl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566004259, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/crfg6w/adventures_in_reproductive_immunology_including_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "crfg6w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/crfg6w/adventures_in_reproductive_immunology_including_a/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1566004259, "score": 31, "selftext": "I've PM'd this info to several people over the last few days so I figured I'd make a stand alone post and maybe add some additional details just in case someone wants to know or someone (in the future) decides to search Reproductive Immunology.   \n\n\nI decided to take the reproductive immunological stance *before* starting IVF for a number of reasons, the primary reason being that I have celiac disease which is an autoimmune disorder. In addition to that I have a MTHFR genetic mutation. Many people only see an RI after failed cycles, but since there was one close by who was just starting his practice that came recommended by someone who goes to the same RE as I am and I decided to book in and see what he could figure out and see if we could get some sort of running start with this.   \n\n\n**The initial visit:** The first visit with my RI was about a half hour long. We talked through my fertility history, start to finish, as well as my health history, he asked clarifying questions about the clinic I was going to, and explained his process. He did say in our initial visit that he usually asks his patients to slow down a bit, which is hard for many of them. I was (at the time) on the wait list for the clinic I'm at now and still planning on IUIs so I was like \"hey! no problem!' In addition to that, he basically explained that the RE runs the IVF cycle however they want, and he makes medical suggestions based on test results that compliment the RE's schedule.   \n\n\nAt the initial visit he ran these tests: \n\n* Testosterone, Free, Total, and Sex Hormone Binding globulin\n* Antiphospholipid Antibody Panel\n* Phosphatidylserine AB\n* Cardiolipin AB\n* Comprehensive Metabolic Panel\n* TSI\n* Phosphatidylserine AB\n* DHEA, Unconjugated\n* Phosphatidylinositol AB\n* Phosphatidylethanolamine AB\n* Phosphatidylglycerol AB\n* AMH\n* Phosphatidic Acid AB\n* ABO Group and RH Type\n* Homocysteine\n* Hemoglobin A1C\n* 25-OH Vit D\n* Immunoglobulin G, M, A\n* TSH w/ Reflex to FT4\n* Thyroid Peroxidase and Thyroglobulin Antibodies\n* Partial Thromboplastin Time, Activated\n* CBC (includes Diff/PLT)\n* Iron and Total Iron Binding Capacity\n* Ferritin\n* Transferrin\n* ANA Screen\n* DNA Antibody\n* SM and SM/RNP Antibodies\n* Histone Antibodies\n* DHEA Sulfate\n* Insulin\n* Prolactin\n* ANCA Screen with Reflex to Titer\n* SCL-70 Antibody\n* NK Activity Assay\n* TH1:TH2 Cytokine Ratio Plus\n\n**Second visit:** By the second visit we had switched REs and were working with our second clinic and working towards IVF. This sped up our RI timeline quite a bit and I had a grasp on what my IVF protocol was going to be like which helped my RI be more specific with suggestions. We also had our test results back and we had a meeting that was roughly 90 minutes long. I had gotten my test results in advance, done a bunch of googling, and had a lot of questions for him. He went through every single test result with me, and  he found some things in the test that warranted some IVF protocol additions and he also recommended some supplement/diet/lifestyle changes as well that he knew would be complimentary based on the results.   \n\n\nIn addition to this, he wanted to run some additional tests. These tests are responses to things found in the initial bloodwork and are more personalized than the first list which he has given everyone I know who has seen him. These are the ones I had done in the second round:   \n\n\n* Factor XIII V34L Mutation Analysis \n* Beta Fibrinogen 455G&gt;A Mutation \n* Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 4G/5G \n* Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Level \n* Human Platelet Antigen 1 Genotype \n* Prothrombin (Factor II) 20210G -&gt; A Mutation Analysis \n* Factor V (Leiden) Mutation Analysis \n* Protein C and S Activity with Reflex to Protein C and/or S Antigen  \n\n* We also reran a few to see if the supplement/diet/lifestyle changes had helped improve some numbers  \n\n\nAt this point, I have not yet seen him a third time but we do communicate via our portal. Basically, as my RE makes a change, I pass that change along to him. If the RI makes a suggestion, I pass that suggestion along to my RE. They get along pretty well and seem to have relatively aligned strategies, though my RI is more nuanced in his approach, and things more holistically (and not in the woo woo sense, but more in the \"lets investigate your supplement brands and lets think about endocrine disrupters\" sense.)  \n\n\n**What now:** My RI has not yet set up a specific protocol for me and is waiting on the results of the additional testing, though my RE took the results of the initial tests that my RI did and put me on a \"half step\" immune system protocol. I'm doing a little immunological prime directed and thought up by my RE and cleared by the RI. Once the RI has his plan together I'll pass it to the RE and we'll go from there. We're just waiting on those final test results.   \n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. Obviously, I have had no success or failure yet since I have yet to go through IVF. Also, my first IVF will be with all of this added on, so I won't have a \"baseline\" IVF cycle without these interventions. I just wanted to speak to the experience of working with an RI so people could understand what happens when you go see one. I didn't put too much specific medical information in because each of us have such different cases that what I'm doing and the protocol changes I have might differ from what you'd do based on your results. I'm happy to speak about them if asked, but I just wanted people to understand how working with an RI can potentially go.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14142, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Adventures in Reproductive Immunology, including a full test list.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566261572, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/crfg6w/adventures_in_reproductive_immunology_including_a/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Art_n_stuff", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e1os2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566021901, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/criex7/i_havent_even_started_an_ivf_cycle_yet_and_im/", "gildings": {}, "id": "criex7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 42, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/criex7/i_havent_even_started_an_ivf_cycle_yet_and_im/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1566021901, "score": 56, "selftext": "This is just a confused rant.\n\nI have been going through the process of testing for ivf.

Throwaway account for posting in this sub.)\n\nTL;DR - Not sure if it's worth continuing with IVF after 3 FET implantation failures with zero likely root causes.  **Looking for personal stories from folks who have never had successful implantation**.\n\nHere's why that last sentence is in bold.  From a year+ of browsing relevant forums online, an IRL support group and a number of friends who have gone through IVF, I have not yet met success cases with my situation.  It feels shitty, but more importantly, it's difficult for me to judge how much someone else's experience or advice can apply to me.  \n\nI've had really well-intentioned folks IRL give a lot of really heartfelt advice on the tests to do, doctors to see, and \"pray/relax/stay positive and it will happen\".  Then I find out that they're having fertility issues after natural/assisted pregnancies or miscarriages, and that they have never met someone in my situation before.  It's not the same, and it's not helpful.  When I did online research into those \"miracle\" tests and treatments, all the successes are women who have had successful implantation before.\n\nMedical history:\n\n1. Never had regular menstruation.  Periods basically stopped in early 20s.  Diagnosed with PCOS at 24.  Always bled regularly on OCP.\n2. No insulin, pituitary, or autoimmune issues (all tested).  Healthy.  Normal BMI.\n3. No factors on my husband's side.\n4. 33 yo.  AMH &gt;25.  Very high antral follicle count.\n5. No endometriosis.  Estrogen and progesterone normal for every FET cycle.  Normal ERA.  Normal SHG.\n6. Retrieved 36 eggs.  97% fertilization rate.  60% high quality.\n7. FET#1: 1 transferred -&gt; FET#2: 2 transferred -&gt; ERA -&gt; PGS: 44% genetically normal -&gt; FET#3: 1 transferred\n8. *Never had a positive pregnancy test.*\n\nAfter all these failures, I'm just wondering what the point is in continuing.  It has been psychologically trying, especially since #2 to #6 mean that I should have had a much higher chance of success, but we don't even have a hint that this is going to work out.\n\nIf we transfer 2 at a time, my insurance will cover the transfers for my remaining embryos.  But I just want to give up now.  We can adopt.  (Surrogacy is off the table for me.)  Or we can just have a full and meaningful life without children.  My husband prefers that we keep trying until we use up the embryos.  I can do probably do that without too much resentment, but mentally, I'm just done.\n\n**If there's anyone out there who have been in my situation (unexplained recurrent implantation failure without any prior successes), I'd love to hear your story, especially:**\n\n1. **Did you keep trying or did you stop?**\n2. **How did you arrive at that decision?**\n3. **How do you feel about it now?**\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14173, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Recurrent implantation failure - not sure if it's worth continuing", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566272448, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cs2d10/recurrent_implantation_failure_not_sure_if_its/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lamington37", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4eaox5xy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566142212, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cs2lp3/gonal_f_pen_available_nearly_full/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cs2lp3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/cs2lp3/gonal_f_pen_available_nearly_full/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1566142213, "score": 22, "selftext": "Hello, I have a nearly full Gonal F pen, 850 units left of the full 900 units.

I believe I finally figured out how to use the flair and I recently got bad news, so I would like to tap the resource of this very knowledgeable sub.  I hope this qualifies for a stand alone post.  I'm 42F, spouse is 43M.\n\n**My main question** \\- Dr. Norbert Gleicher at the Center for Human Reproduction in NYC (not local for me), does anyone have knowledge of this doctor and his claims to have a 30% success rate for getting women over 40 pregnant with their own eggs? \n\n**For treatment history and further questions and feelings, please keep reading.**\n\nI started going to a hospital affiliated fertility clinic (known to be conservative in treatment protocols, but the only locally based clinic in my city) in 4/2018, right before my 41st birthday.  Did all the testing, doctors were optimistic about my chances of getting pregnant.  They said my ovaries were younger than I was (AMH 3.943).  I started taking 25 mg DHEA and 200 mg COQ10, both 3 times a day.  Spouse's SA was normal for number and mobility.  Wound further SA be helpful?\n\nI did 2 IUIs in the summer of 2018, the second one resulted in a chemical pregnancy - no heatbeat detected.  Both IUIs were done with antagonist protocol medications.\n\nThis wasn't going to be easy.  I limited alcohol to 1, 4 oz. drink a week and caffeine to one cup a day.  I work out twice a week.  I reduced my anxiety medication (prozac) as low as possible without negative consequences (4 mls of a 20 mg per 5ml liquid).\n\nNext, IVF with BC priming - first 2 were antagonist protocol (Gonal F, Centrotide, Menopur, HGH) where I had follicles numbering in the teens for each round, but resulted in only 1 embryo.  First IVF was triggered by hCG and the second with hCG and Lupron). Doctor said I might have empty follicle syndrome and that I should move to a donor egg.\n\nI wasn't ready to move to a donor, so she suggested a micro dose Lupron protocol (micro dose Lupron, Gonal F, Menopur, HGH) that I would try for 3 additional rounds of IVF from 12/2018 to 8/2019.  Third IVF trigger was hCG, fourth was hCG (needed a booster) and Lupron (screw up with the weekend doctor, my doctor told me at my follow-up appointment that if anyone tried to trigger me with Lupron again to tell them \"hell no\"), and the fifth trigger was hCG (needed a booster).  The results were much better, over these 3 rounds, I got 10 additional embryos, each time the number of mature follicles numbered in the teens and most fertilized, but as you know, the hunger games happened.  During the fifth round my estradiol level went over 4,300 and I was at risk for OHSS.  I was put on cabergoline right before retrieval.  If you ever need this medication, do yourself a favor and take stool softeners with it.  I have never been that constipated.\n\nAfter sending the 11 embryos to CopperGenomics, 8 were complex abnormal, 2 were abnormal, and 1 is no result and needs to be re-biopsied, but I'm not hopeful.\n\nDifferent clinic doctor (mine is on leave) told me by phone a week ago about the genetic results of the fifth round and said that the probability of having a baby with my own egg is &lt;5%.  She suggested going back to IUI or moving to donor eggs.  We have an appointment with her on Thursday of this coming week.  Is she suggesting IUI because of the suspect ability of genetic testing?  I have read research papers about mosaics and even abnormals that have produced genetically normal babies (mostly outside the US).  Maybe I am being overly optimistic about this possibility, but my clinic has said they will not transfer our abnormal embryos and I wonder if the IUI is a way for the doctor to get around the policy.  The downside is that we may have another CP or a genetically abnormal fetus that we have to make hard decisions about.\n\nI have been told I would be a good candidate for a donor egg (although I don't count on anything be \"easy\" anymore).  I'm having a very hard time giving up my dream of seeing what a child that is a mixture of my spouse and I would be like in personality and physical appearance.  My biggest fear is that it will feel like I am raising someone else's child.  My next project is reading books on donor eggs and epigenetics, but I haven't found much up-to-date literature out there.  Has anyone read something they would recommend?\n\nI think I would like to try another IUI with the micro dose Lupron protocol.  Someone told me that the micro dose Lupron protocol tends to produce a higher number of lower quality follicles, is that true?  My spouse is mostly understanding, but really just wants a child.  Of course, unlike me, he passes on his genetics either way.\n\nIf I am leaving out any details that would clarify anything, please let me know.

We are always glad to see members graduate, and to welcome new users in to the fold. However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.\n\nIf you haven't already, please read our rules (https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/about/rules). If you're on mobile you can find this under \"About Community\" at the top of the page (look for the three dots in the upper right corner).\n\n**Mention of pregnancy or positive results** post treatment is only permitted in the results thread. Vague and sensitive mentions to \"success\" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies \"I had success with A,B,C\"). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.\n\n**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses \"blessed\", \"miraculously,\" \"easily conceived\", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.\n\n**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.\n\nThis is a **science-minded, realistic, and sometimes cynical sub**. There are many communities online for people who want a more \"positive\" or \"upbeat\" experience complete with baby du$t.  People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic, and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies/cures as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).\n\nSex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. **Infertility isn't cute**, and neither are the terms we use. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.\n\n**No solicitations** will be allowed for monetary or medication donations. To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed.\n\nIf you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button. The \"report\" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment. Reports are anonymous, but selecting a reason is very helpful context. This will help us to actively moderate this community and makes it easier to catch posts or comments that break our rules.\n\nAs always, we are so proud to moderate this amazing community of strong, diverse and compassionate women (and men).

Where do I begin. \n\nBeen trying to conceive for about 3 years now. In that time we\u2019ve had three missed miscarriages. My husband travels a lot for work so #1 and #3 he wasn\u2019t here for. I think there\u2019s some guilt there on his end and he thinks I resent him for it, which I don\u2019t. At all. \n\nSince #1 our sex life has stopped almost completely. I had complications with the d&amp;c with the first one which made it impossible for us to have sex for about a month. \n\nTwo months after that my husband started to feel sluggish and like he didn\u2019t want to have sex at all. A year went by and I finally got him to go to the doctor. He found out he has extremely low testosterone. And he can\u2019t go on testosterone supplements while we\u2019re trying because then we have way less of a chance of getting pregnant. Catch 22. So we\u2019ve worked through some things and after a rollercoaster of fighting and insecurities on both ends, we\u2019ve been left with only having sex during ovulation. \n\nThis is fine, except I miss passion and I miss my husband.

No side effects (which I thought was awesome, but now I am wondering if that also means no effect). Today was the \"measure follicles day\": right side one mature follicle, one immature one; left side nothing. Also= \"thin uterine lining\".  Now we have to decide- go through with the IUI this week (means trigger shot tonight and IUI on Wed) OR try \"naturally\" and wait until next month and get 7.5 mgs of Femara to see if more than one follicle develops. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Iui- we are \"allowed\" three rounds total; each one is $950. \n\nRE said he gives patients the choice because likelihood is increased with more than one follicle but it could also be that this IUI takes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess here is my concern: it's my understanding that IUI helps because of timing but also because it places the \"washed sperm\" right where it needs to be (as opposed to sex which means sperm needs to make their way through my potentially hostile environment...) \n\nI have very little CM if any; thin lining; and periods only last a few days.

I feel really discouraged right now in my journey.   Did you ever feel the overwhelming emotion that your RE was missing something? \n\nI went through all of the testing.  SA normal.  HSG open tubes.  Bloodwork normal.  The only thing is I have slightly longer cycles ~38 days so they have determined I have an ovulation disorder.  I have never been pregnant before each month my period comes exactly on time.  \n\nFor 1 year so far I have been on fertility drugs.  Half of that time I have been doing medicine and TI.  I did not respond well to clomid so I had quite a few cycles where I needed stair stepped to even ovulate.  Now I have moved to IUI + Femara and trigger shots.  2 IUIs failed.   This month due to being out of town during monitoring we did Femara + trigger and TI. Haven\u2019t got my period yet - it is due this week.  \n\nI just feel concerned with treatment plan that if I am ovulating and still no pregnancy, are they missing something else? My mother had stage 4 endometriosis which I voiced a year ago that I was concerned if there is a hereditary link what if I have it.  It was really brushed off at my visit.  \n\nEach month starting 2-3 days after ovulation the backaches start setting it.  I also get leg pain during that time on and off until the period comes.  It is a dull ache feeling and usually only on my right side.  A week before my period shows up every morning I get cramps which will go away once I\u2019m up and around but I find that weird.  Another hallmark symptom I notice every month after ovulation is digestive issues which have me running to the bathroom every morning.  When I mention the leg pain and backaches to my RE they tell me it\u2019s normal but I\u2019m still worried about it because I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s common, especially the leg pain.  \n\nJust looking for advice.

I\u2019m pretty sure the diazepam didn\u2019t do anything for me as diazepam\u2019s never do. \n\nIn the operation theatre, I actually started crying hysterically and made a huge fool out of myself. The RE and nurse kept reassuring me I\u2019d be fine and trying to relax me. My husband too. \n\nThey used the speculum to \u2018open\u2019 my vagina and a local numbing agent was injected near my cervix. Similar to what they use at the dentists. I didn\u2019t really feel this - shockingly. I just felt a mild jabbing and I honestly could not tell it was the numbing injection going in. My nurse had to tell me it had been done!! \n\nI then had gas and air and said a bunch of stupid stuff. I kept telling my husband I loved him whilst stroking his hair, all whilst my nurse was constantly moving my arm away from his head because I was knocking the blood pressure cuff off of my arm. I also kept swearing and saying I had no idea where I was. Truthfully I was in another world. It was crazy good! \n\nI did feel some pressure like pain that made me wince a few times, but I would describe it as more of a deep aching sensation than anything stabby or overly painful. At one point, my husband told me I gasped out in pain and said \u201cthat really hurts, please give me some more gas and air\u201d and they complied and I was fine. \n\nIt was all over in 15 minutes, I got 19 eggs. \n\nI hope this reassures anyone in future about their egg collection if it isn\u2019t under proper sedation or GA! I was terrified and had been crying all morning about it. I barely slept a wink last night. It was totally fine and I\u2019m at home resting up now :-) \n\nThank you for all of your support over the past few weeks x", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14216, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Egg retrieval without sedation - my experience", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566485304, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cthwdg/egg_retrieval_without_sedation_my_experience/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "IVFusername", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "29 | CBAVD/MFI | AMH 1.56 | 2 ERs FET #1", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3qe72ye1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566402531, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ctinfq/first_fet_cancelled_thoughts_on_plan/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ctinfq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ctinfq/first_fet_cancelled_thoughts_on_plan/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1566402532, "score": 0, "selftext": "Sadly my first FET was canceled.  We are only doing IVF because of my husband\u2019s lack of a vas deferens, so I didn\u2019t expect this to be an issue but...my doc has an interesting take on the reasons my lining couldn\u2019t get thick enough. For reference, it got to 9-10 on stim cycles. But on the transfer cycle, it only got to 7 and we couldn\u2019t do anything to save it once it started degrading. \n\nWithout sounding like a humblebraggart, my doctor believes it\u2019s a combo issue of my age/metabolism. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d 122 lb, so not underweight, but not a lot of body fat. I lift weights but not excessively, but I am one of those people who loses weight without trying, and could eat McDonald\u2019s daily and not gain weight.  I got it from my dad who is 61 and still has trouble gaining weight. Typically I love this and see it as a blessing, because I love food, but my RE said it looks like any supplemental estrogen is just metabolized too fast and my body doesn\u2019t have time to register it, which is why estradiol doesn\u2019t work, but stimulating my own ovaries to produce estrogen has worked.  She says her estrogen booster shots tend to work on older patients, but didn\u2019t work on me because I\u2019m younger and active, plus my lining was already deteriorating at that point. \n\nAnyway, we have 4 PGS normals but because we are banking I really wanted a couple more. We have one vial of sperm left too. My RE suggested we do another stimulation cycle, retrieval, and then transfer a PGS normal after!! I loved this idea because the plan was to do another retrieval if this FET didn\u2019t work, and I didn\u2019t realize I could knock both out in one try! \n\nHopefully I\u2019m not being too optimistic, but my RE says the fact that I\u2019ve gotten to 10 before means this is a matter of how I absorb synthetic hormones and not a uterine issue. \n\nI also wanted to make sure you all knew this was a thing!

I have PCOS and he has low morphology (only one SA was done, but RE feels confident that it is a factor). \n\nAt this time, we have focused on lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, reducing stress, getting sleep, etc) and basic supplements recommended by our RE. I also had some success regulating my cycle length with progesterone cream (could not confirm ovulation though), however I stopped taking it for a few cycles back when we were going through all the diagnostic testing, and when I got back on it didn't seem as effective this time around (no idea why). I have not taken any prescription medications. We are both about to start Acupuncture, but not putting much faith in it and it's honestly just so we can say to ourselves we've tried everything. \n\nWe are unable to pursue further fertility treatment until the end of the year when I will be getting new insurance that covers it. Our current recommendation is either Letrozole with IUI and then failing that, IVF - ICSI, or just going straight to the IVF - ICSI. I still have not made a decision on that. \n\nSo, my question is, until then, what can we do? Just keep doing the same as usual, or is there anything worth trying for a few months to encourage my ovulation? I have considered trying Vitex as it's supposedly helpful for PCOS, however I also read conflicting reports that is elevates LH which mine is already too high. The fertility office also suggested Provera could at least help with my cycle lengths and PCOS, but wouldn't do much to increase chances of ovulation.

I have a few questions about Femara. I\u2019m not new to Femara, but I *am* new to random mid-pill spotting. \n\nI have PCOS. Had a baseline ultrasound and doc considered it CD3 (Monday). So I started Femara. 5mg CD3-7. Today is CD6. I just went to the restroom and noticed spotting. Does anyone know why this would occur? Is this cycle already a wash? This isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve experienced before. I have one more day of Femara left (tomorrow). \n\nThanks ladies. I appreciate this sub so much even though I\u2019m mostly a lurker. \ud83d\udc9b", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14229, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spotting on Letrozole?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566562163, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ctwisb/spotting_on_letrozole/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
