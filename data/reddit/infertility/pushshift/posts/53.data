I found this one https://www.sartcorsonline.com/Predictor/Patient but it only gives you your % chance of success with IVF. I'm sure a bunch of us would love to be able to compare chances of success with IVF vs naturally vs other treatments.

Then if I have x but try z (clomid) to improve my chances, how does that change my success rate? I can only speak for myself here, but I think it would help me be more patient each cycle (like i may only have a  2% chance naturally right now...why get my hopes up) and to better prioritize where to focus my treatment energies.

Perhaps it hurts so much because we were once close, or had very high expectations of them. (I have only one sibling, my sister, so no basis of comparison to brothers for me). Here is a place you can vent, make fun of your sisters, whatever you need to feel better.\n\nI'll start this by saying my sister has been a wall of ice since I started IVF. When I told her I was planning to start the process, she tersely said \"I don't know what to say\" repeatedly, so I sent her the Resolve info for friends and family info and she ignored it. We've barely spoken since. She wasn't like this during my IUIs. We used to have a close, warm relationship, so this smarts. I got a smiley face in response to my text that one embryo made it. That hurt and offended me a lot. I got one call, a perfunctory Christmas call that lasted 5 minutes and she didn't let me say anything. She talked so fast about her holiday, never asking about mine, and very firmly wished me a merry Christmas like she didn't want to hear a word out of me and wanted to get me off the phone ASAP. She knew I had my FET yesterday and nothing. This all hurts a lot, especially as I supported her through decades of chronic illness and other problems, always with all the warmth and kindness (and sometimes cash) I could. It's just been worse and worse since her daughter, who I adore, started school. My sister has acted more and more like people who don't have children have very easy, charmed lives - knowing our struggle of years of IF. No matter what, she has the hardest life and other people's problems are not serious. It's really sad, actually, if she's defining herself that way and can't empathize with others any more. Also, I now have chronic illness too, so she doesn't have that \"title\" all to herself any more - even though she is the only family member who knows of both my illness and IF. She seems define herself as a sick person and as a mom. I guess that's so much of her identity it could feel like I'm threatening it by being in an intense medical treatment to have a baby. It's hard to understand all this. I am not initiating any contact with my sister any time soon and am determined to somehow have a civil relationship so I can maintain access to my niece. I'm not looking for solutions, just wanted to vent and show if you're having a bad time with your sister, you are not alone.\n\nSo that's me.

This is probably more of a rant than anything else..\n\nWe're awaiting CD1 to see if we're a go next cycle and we're running into what's become something of a frustratingly familiar problem.\n\nFrom the get-go we've known that we'd need assistance conceiving, since we always knew we'd have to use donor sperm.  But it seems that every time we get the go-ahead for a cycle, we're scrambling around trying to choose a donor who can be shipped to the clinic in time. \n\nBeing that we're in Canada, and donors here cannot be paid for samples, there is a much more limited market of samples to choose from.  The way that it works, at least as far as I understand it, is that there are a couple of \"cyro-brokers\" that import donor samples from the US and sell them here in Canada.  \n\nThere seem to be some Health Canada screening guidelines that significantly cut down on US donor catalogs.  This, coupled with needing to rely on the brokers to have a given donor in stock, is making it challenging for us to have a sample chosen, ordered, purchased, and shipped to our clinic in the short window between CD2/3 testing that confirms we're a go, and CD9/10 when I could potentially ovulate.\n\nOf course, we could always have gone ahead and purchased multiple vials of our preferred donors to keep at the ready, but obviously no-one can predict exactly how many vials we'll need to be successful, so it's kind of a crapshoot, plus the cyrobanks charge a not-insignificant amount to store the samples for any length of time.  On top of this, if we had been lucky enough to be successful on the first try, they will only buy back samples at 50% of the original cost, which really is a bunch of BS.\n\nSo our decision has been to order samples as we need them, which means we're limited to whatever stock the cyrobank happens to have on the shelf at the time. \n We're not incredibly restrictive with our donors, I think we have a fairly decent short list of 5 or 6 candidates that we'd be comfortable using, but every time we get the go ahead to order, it seems like at least a couple of them are not available.  Last cycle, Mr. Friend ended up ordering a vial from each of the brokers to make sure we had the samples we needed for our back-to-back IUIs, since both brokers were down to 1 left of this particular donor... and this was after 3 of our other candidates were out-of-stock.\n\nI guess I'm just frustrated that the system here doesn't seem to be meeting demand if they're out of stock so often.  I'm also frustrated that the cyrobanks seem to be taking every opportunity to capitalize off of people in really shitty situations.  It was hard enough for Mr. Friend and I to come to the decision to use donor sperm, and thoughtfully selecting donors was a process that we worked through together.  It's unnerving to have to keep making snap decisions at the last minute when it's time to go.

I took a month to recover also in preparation for my PhD Viva. \n\nThe time I spent with my friends was great it really helped me getting myself through the hurt and disappointment of the failure of our first cycle. \n\n\nThe time I spent with my family was less relaxing, to use a euphemism. It soon became clear that my mum and my brother were not really supporting my choice to pursue IVF. It was a shower of bingos. I was in tears, I felt totally ambushed especially as my brother came over at my mom's place with the excuse to have lunch all together, but when he arrived they had me sit on the sofa and they started attacking me (yes there was a lot of shouting) like if they were doing an intervention against my obsession to become pregnant. \nKeep in mind it was less than 10 days since we lost our embryos and when I breached the subjected of possible egg donation (due to the low quality of my eggs) I was accused of not just wanting a baby, but a pregnancy. Apparently, they are mutually excluding each other in case of fertility problem (great logic, I know). \n\nI made the decision in that moment not to include them in any further information about what we are going or not going to do (I failed that resolution, but that's another story). \n\nLuckily, I also have a great uncle and aunt who struggled when they tried to conceive my cousin. It took them 12 years and they were more understanding; they offered support, understanding and a lot of love. (Yay, I also have decent relatives). \n\n\nWhen I came back to the UK we had an appointment with the OB/GYN consultant at the hospital and we were granted another cycle on the NHS, I suggested changing the protocol and she agreed it was the best shot we could give.\nSo short protocol, microflare still 450 Menopur but split between drugs, more details when I actually get my hands on the drugs.\nWe shall start in the next few days. I will update in the active treatment thread as things get into moving.\n\n**Plan b?**\nWe also had the first appointment with the hospital counsellor to discuss egg donation.  Mr Wonky is the cautious type, so he didn't want to discuss any other option ahead of time, but I felt the need to know what was available and where we stand from a legal standpoint if this cycle fails too.  In the UK children conceived from donors have the right at the age of 18 to know the identity of the donor. This terrified me, but the counsellor was really helpful and I now don't feel threatened about this eventuality if this is the path we will decide to take. \n\nIt also felt good to have Mr Wonky listen to what were my ideas, hopes and worries in front of a counsellor. I felt free to express every upsetting thought I had on the matter. \nI came home with a lot of food for thoughts. \n\n**What now?**\nWhile I wait for my period to start, I am still waiting on my Viva report containing the minor corrections that the University wants me to add to my thesis and I also started working a little more full time as a translator (self-employed is my new 2018 project - yay!). \n\nI am not feeling emotionally excited about this second cycle approaching. I think I am more realistic about what it entails and I am also protecting my little self from disappointment. I am sure once I will be in it I will feel better. Surely, I will feel happier because I will be able to eat normally again (at our mid-December consent appointment I was reminded I had a BMI restriction to access my second cycle, so I spent the holiday season dieting to lose the 6 pounds that I gained in the last 6 months).\n\nI am back, for better or for worse.

[TW: mentions loss]\n\nI'm 36, been trying for two years.  Our diagnosis is mild MFI and I've lost a tube after an ectopic.  I've had two spontaneous pregnancies since we started trying: a miscarriage at 5 weeks and an ectopic that resulted in removal of a tube.  A hycosy showed a blocked or spasmed right tube (later removed with the ectopic) but no other uterine abnormalities and 3D ultrasounds done for the ectopic showed a normal uterine cavity.  After the tube removal, I started IVF, had first cycle in September with a good response to stims, transferred one 5 day blast that didn't succeed, and got two 5 day blasts to freeze.  The only hitch with that cycle was that I had a persistent follicular cyst that required drainage and my estrogen was 600-700 prior to stims, so I was downregulated for a few extra weeks before stimming.   We haven't done PGD or had any ERAs/scratches, immune testing, fragmentation/genetics, and/or immune testing or any other add-ons.  I'm in the UK receiving treatment on the NHS, which I am grateful for, but there are fewer extras available to us at this point. \n\nOur WTF appointment in October was pretty useless, the consultant was patronising and didn't have much insight into why our cycle failed.  He said I responded well to the drugs so we should just do our FETs but be prepared for a full three collection cycles as that's how long it may take for success.  We were told our embryo was \"beautiful\" so he didn't know why it didn't take. I mentioned that I'd had some light periods after my miscarriage so he said to do a hysteroscopy to check for scarring.  However, he seemed surprised when I told him I hadn't had a D&amp;C (and never had PID, STI, etc.) so not sure how I would have developed scarring.  When I queried this, he brushed it off and said it wouldn't hurt to do the procedure.  (I was a bit taken aback as it does require some cervical dilation, anaesthesia, etc., so to call it \"nothing\" seems a bit cavalier).  Also, my lining was fine and trilaminar on scans at our first cycle, and my periods have been generally pretty normal save for a small amount of spotting a day or two before/after (I reckon I wouldn't have even noticed this if I weren't on knicker watch every month).  When I queried these things, the consultant continued to fob me off and said it wouldn't hurt to do the hysteroscopy but didn't provide any justification.\n\nI understand the hysteroscopy can find scar tissue and/or polyps that might be interfering with implantation and repair them, but I also believe that these things would have been detected on one of my many scans or hycosy, is that correct?  \n\nBecause of NHS waiting times, I won't have the hysteroscopy until at least April, which will be eight months after my first failed transfer!  It seems that I may be able to do a natural FET in February, and if it doesn't succeed, then I'm still in line to do the hysteroscopy in April.  And if it does succeed, well, then the hysteroscopy isn't necessary.  My husband is in favor of trying for a natural FET before the hysteroscopy, as am I.  But if we don't do the transfer in Feb, we would then be waiting until May/June after the scope, which would leave us in Sept 2018(ish) for another transfer if this one didn't take...and the next stim cycle not until I'm 37 in 2019. My AMH last Feb was 9, so I suppose that is also relevant.\n\nIt seems worthwhile to me to try with the next embryo now, as we both feel eager to just get on with it.  I also feel physically ready to go forward now and (pardon my non-scientific belief) but just feel like this is a good time to move forward, so I'm also feeling as emotionally ready as I can be.  I reckon I'd also thought the scope would be in Jan/Feb (as was originally told to us) so perhaps I'd mentally prepared for now to be our chance.  We would like to do our FETs before doing another stim cycle, but we are of course aware that might be a possibility down the road, so would like to get moving on it if that makes sense.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?  Would you do the FET now or wait until after the hysteroscopy?

My clinic is not having me come in for a baseline ultrasound, which is a bit strange to me. What if something\u2019s not right and we waste a bunch of money on medications?\nThen I found out my first monitoring appointment is just a blood test on day 5 of stims. My clinic has already taken one of the stimulating drugs out of my protocol and has me on the minimum dose for the other, because they\u2019re worried about overstimming me, and so now I\u2019m freaked out that there will only be a few follicles developing, and they won\u2019t know because there won\u2019t be an ultrasound. I sent an email asking about this and the nurse got back to me saying \u2018the doctor hasn\u2019t ordered any ultrasounds for you so it won\u2019t be necessary!

We are an early stage startup based out of the University of Pennsylvania trying to improve success rates and predictability for in vitro fertilization: https://mackinstitute.wharton.upenn.edu/2017/2017-2018-y-prize-finalists/\n\nWhat we've developed is a new method for preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) that is faster, more accurate, and does not damage embryo cells with biopsies; it is our hope that this technology will change the lives of many aspiring parents by increasing their probability of success for each IVF cycle through rapid, accurate diagnoses and minimal embryo loss during the screening process.\n\nIn order to guide the development of our technology and ensure we are going in the right direction, we are looking to gather patient experiences (with mod approval) through a brief, anonymous online survey. We understand that this is a very sensitive topic, so all questions are completely optional.\n\nHere is a link to the survey: https://wharton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0rN5YLkPlWlCGup\n\nThe responses will be used to support market research that will be presented to investors so we can bring our idea to life. In addition, we have partnered with researchers at the university as well as independent fertility clinics in the greater Philadelphia area to develop our product.\n\nThank you in advance for offering to tell your stories to improve IVF and PGS as a whole. If you have any more questions about who we are or what we do, ask away and I'll answer what I can in the comments.\n\nThank you!\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Experiences with Preimplantation Genetic Testing(PGT/PGS/PGD)?

Also I suck at brevity but TL;DR I'm a guy who's not having kids any time soon but has had to decide not to store his genetic material before starting treatment that has effectively nuked his parts and also I'm trans which is secondary in all this \n\nI wonder if anyone can share what they did to deal better with when they received an infertility diagnosis at a point in their life when they weren't actively trying to conceive. \n\nI'm a 26 yo guy living with my 28 yo girlfriend of four years, we do have plans to have children in the future, but not right now. However since August 2016 we know we won't be having children who are genetically mine, seeing as I am transgender and decided against storing my genetic material. (We decided together but ultimately of course it was my decision.) Egg cell extraction is not covered by health insurance in my situation in my country and besides the huge financial cost, after having a gynaecologist explain the procedure to me I also knew I was not up for the emotional cost of internal echos and in general getting into one of those gynaecological chairs. \n\nThere are clinics in my country who do ropa (reception of oocytes from partner) for female couples but the clinic I was at which was willing to treat guys, only wanted to do ropa if my girlfriend was proven unable to use her own egg cells, so that was another reason to not go through the 4000 euros procedure. We were assuming if it gets to that point we're to heartbroken to start with any of mine and we'll just foster or adopt. \n\nTechnically I suppose the stuff still works probably? If I stop hormones for however many months, which is not an option for me, and I know some guys view this differently but I am just not going down that road. In October 2016 i started hormone replacement therapy and it feels like this is a ship that sailed. I did continue to have a period for a while which was awful so I got additional medication (progesterone only birth control) for a while to get rid of it. It was like a monthly reminder that there was a probably functional womb in there. In the future I'm getting my womb removed, although I'm also not actively waitlisting for that operation because I don't feel emotionally ready to go through that yet. (Also - the gynaecological chairs.) \n\nThere are no further steps for me to take right now, no tests to do or appointments to book. I'm just some guy who can't have kids. My girlfriend and me discuss options like multiple parent families (for instance with a male couple) and known donor sperm. Recently we seem to be gravitating towards a known donor. All of this is something that might start two years from now. In the meantime, I don't know... I feel a sadness sometimes that I don't know what to do with. \n\nI don't know anyone else who just KNOWS they won't have genetic offspring. I have one friend from college who had issues conceiving with her husband and I'm happy for them that they had success finally, but I am also jealous although that is really misplaced after all the shit they struggled through in the past couple years, and don't want to discuss with specifically her how I am incapable of something they finally did manage together. My parents were utterly unhelpful in that they just said grandchildren were not on the agenda for them right now, which totally ignores that I did have to make this decision based on a chronical medical condition that makes me unable to produce my own sperm and dependent on somebody else's. It's not about the grandchildren, who will get there in whatever way, it's about my infertility. It's about the collateral damage caused by starting treatment for my condition. Nobody around me seems to treat it as seriously as me and my girlfriend feel it is.\n\nI feel inadequate and alone and I know I will love my child(ren) no matter what, but until we start trying I also just don't know how to deal with my grief. I have days where, even though I almost never see family resemblances that other people point out to me, I suddenly see assumed dads in the wild with their assumed kids and think \"clearly these people are genetically related, I will never have that\".\n\nI know this is a very specific situation with the trans stuff but regardless I hope there are more people on here who heard about their infertility years before they actively started on a process, and hope you have some insight into what I might do. But maybe there is no solution? Thank you for reading all of this anyway. \n\nI also hope it's okay to call my situation infertility even though my original plumbing may have been functional before I started hormones/medication. I'm really not out to hurt anyone.

I have my HSG this week, and the cycle after that I start IUI's (probably 3) and I guess move to IVF this summer if nothing has worked.

I found out I was born with half a uterus with a canal on the right side. So my only option is either surrogacy, fostering, adoption.   All of them have known I have struggled and the diagnosis has been emotional for me. \n\nSo today my friend and I decided to go through surrogacy and she would be the surrogate. She has offered previously but I always told her no because I had to go through my own demons about not carrying my own child. I am the oldest granddaughter in the family. I\u2019m the type of person who would be there for everyone; if you are in the hospital or hurting for money or even need support some other way I will be there for you. Without questions. They all have children except my brother, my cousin, and I. I am doing all this on my own. No spouse no partner... nothing. Getting a sperm donor from a sperm Bank eventually. \n\nSo tonight I told my family through group chat for the whole family to find out that I\u2019m going to try to go through surrogacy. No congratulations or oh my god we are so happy.... radio silence. Other than my mom who is excited about this ...was my moms cousin. Everyone else said nothing. I was like ok maybe they all were too busy and didn\u2019t actually read it...\n\nI went on to make me a gofund me page (friends idea due to the amount of money needed) and so far nothing has been donated. I know it\u2019s earlier but I\u2019m feeling very negative about the response. I know it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s responsibility to help me but you would think I would get one donation. I\u2019m having a hard time with how many people not just family feel about me going through surrogacy. They all always tell me I should try to become a parent and that I would be a wonderful mother.... then I announced hat I\u2019m going to try a couple options and bam it goes silent. No one is cheering with me...those who I thought would be happy aren\u2019t saying anything. \n\nI told my friend that people in my life are selfish; if you aren\u2019t building something for them to make their life better they have no interest in moving mountains for you. She said to continue to be positive but damn it\u2019s hard. \n\nHow did some of you get through the surrogacy with your family and friends? How did you afford it? Just hurt and trying to keep moving forward.
