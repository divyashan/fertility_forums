I don't know if this is where I belong.  I'll give you my story, and you can tell me if this is the right spot for me.  I read some posts and the sidebar but I didn't see anything about my particular situation.\n\nDue to a lot of very, very bad health problems in my late teens/early 20s, I had to make a choice at 22.  I could continue on the path I was and be sick/unable to work/unable to go to school/get blood transfusions and intravenous iron every few months, maybe forever.. Or I could get endometrial ablation surgery.\nThe doctors were reluctant to do it at my age.  I was so, so tired of being sick that I would have done just about anything to get better.  Any pregnancy after ablation surgery would likely be ectopic or immediately miscarry, so they also inserted essure coils during the surgery.\n\nSo my infertility was my choice.  And I feel incredibly guilty and inadequate about it.\n\nAt 22, I never imagined I'd ever be at the point where I would desperately want to have a child of my own, but here I am.  I'm in love, and we haven't been together long enough to actually start planning kids, but I know we will in the near(ish) future.\n\nMy boyfriend knows.  It's something I've always brought up early-ish in a relationship (like when we start having sex) because I understand it's a big deal.\n\nHere's the thing, though.  I was at the doctor recently, and we concluded that the lining of my uterus has grown back.  As it stands, the issues I had when I was younger have NOT returned, so there's no need to do the surgery again at this point.\n\nI asked the doctor if this means I might be able to safely carry a child, and I was told that if an ultrasound confirms that my lining is thick enough, I can, probably.\n\nThis doesn't eliminate the obstacle of the Essure.  I can't get pregnant.  We will have to have enough money to try IVF or hire a gestational surrogate.\n\nBasically, I don't know if I belong here.  I do know that I want more than anything to have a baby of my own, and it isn't possible.  I am so happy for my friends who have babies but so angry at myself that I made it impossible to have any.\n\nI feel I'm dealing with a lot of the same feelings that other people with infertility feel, even though it *might* be possible for me to have a child.\n\nIs this the right place for me?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Introduction.

It didn't seem like anyone had any information, so I wanted to check in, in case my experience helps someone else.  \n\nAs background, my state requires infertility coverage, but my employer falls in one of the loopholes, so doesn\u2019t have to provide it!  Last year my husband and I spent just over $20k on one failed fresh and one failed frozen cycles.\n\nSo I wanted to check into whether I could purchase coverage that did cover infertility, in addition to the insurance that was provided through my work.  No one really knew if I could, or what the process was, so I probably spent 15+ hours on the phone with dozens of different people.  Here\u2019s what I learned:\n\n\u2022\tYou can be double covered.  The catch is that you\u2019re not eligible for any premium subsidies (ie, you have to pay the entire premium yourself- the federal government won\u2019t help you)\n\n\u2022\tMake sure your RE is a covered physician/the office is a covered office for the plan you\u2019re considering!\n\n\u2022\tPlan ahead.  The open enrollment period runs from November until February (I think).  Other than some other extenuating circumstances, that\u2019s the only chance you have to sign up!\n\n\u2022\tConfirm several times that the coverage is for infertility treatment, and not just diagnosis!  Ask the insurance company to run some infertility treatment codes to make sure they\u2019re covered before deciding on a plan.\n\n\u2022\tCheck out the premium prices v. coverage.  For example, I pay just over $300/month for a gold plan with a $500 deductible and a $3800 yearly out of pocket max.  So I\u2019ll pay the first $500, then 20% of all costs up to a maximum of $3800.  So the most I\u2019ll pay this year, no matter how many procedures we do, is $7400 (the OOP + premium costs).  If I\u2019d paid less in premiums, the OOP would be correspondingly higher, and might lead to a higher end cost.  \n\n\u2022\tSee if your employer offers a flex spending plan to save pre-tax money that can be used for medical expenses.  You can\u2019t use it for paying premiums, but you can use it for the deductible/OOP.  \n\n\u2022\tAs soon as you get your new insurance card, get in touch with your RE\u2019s office and ask the billing coordinator to double-check the coverage it includes.  You have one month (or at least I did, with BCBS) to decide you don\u2019t want the coverage.\n\n\u2022\tBe completely honest.  It\u2019ll ask on the forms if you have other insurance.  Be sure you fill in the information it asks for.  If you don\u2019t, that can be grounds for denying your claims. \n\n\u2022\tCall the insurance company if you have ANY questions.  And if the person you\u2019re talking to can\u2019t answer them, ask for someone else who might be able to. \n\n\u2022\tThe billing coordinator at my RE\u2019s office told me that she\u2019s been doing this for ten years, and has never seen a private (non-employer) plan offer infertility coverage.  Well, thanks Obama!  Check out both healthcare.gov and your corresponding state exchange (if available).\n\n\u2022\tMake sure you have the first month\u2019s premium PAID before it\u2019s due.  Not just in the mail- actually paid and applied to your account.  One of the quirks of the ACA is that they have to cancel the plan if the first month\u2019s premium is late.  \n\nI\u2019m getting ready to start a fresh cycle, and so far things are going well (preauthorization is accepted, meds are ordered).  I\u2019ll update this if I have any further information or problems, but I sure hope this is helpful for others in a similar situation!\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Double insurance coverage for infertility treatment", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/32t0it/double_insurance_coverage_for_infertility/"}, {"author": "MooseMooses", "author_created_utc": 1407420985, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Waiting on Aug FET", "author_fullname": "t2_hro22", "created_utc": 1429197556, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/32tabx/trigger_shot_timing_question_or_why_wont_my_res/", "gilded": 0, "id": "32tabx", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/32tabx/trigger_shot_timing_question_or_why_wont_my_res/", "retrieved_on": 1440789837, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI need some advice.

It's not that I don't like my current OB, but I felt WAY more comfortable from the get-go with this one.  He put me at ease immediately.  He looked over my charts from my RE and then we explained in detail my surgery (since stupid hospital didn't get us the records in time).  Then he starts throwing around words like *endometriosis, stage 4*.  **Stage 4?!**  What the crap.  And actually, that wasn't even the biggest shocker.  Saying I had endo was.  You see, my RE blatantly told me that what I have is not endo, at all.  No chance.  At all.  (That's where the miff comes in.)  New doc said he obviously can't confirm without taking a sample and sending it to a pathologist, but from what my charts indicate and how I described all the adhesions from my surgery, he's almost positive it is.  \n\nHe then proceeded to call me unique.  Ha!  Because I knew I wasn't normal.  I didn't take it negatively.  It actually made me giggle a bit.  I brought up my RE's suggestion to do esure (sp?) implants to seal off my tubes since they couldn't remove them.  I told him my apprehension to that.  He explained it in much more detail than my RE which makes me 1) like him more and 2) even more reluctant to do it.  He even said that while it can provide a greater chance of IVF success, he doesn't like the idea of a coil sticking out into my uterus with a baby growing.  I kind of agree here.  \n\nI asked him what clinic he would refer me to (since he's not an RE), and he mentioned where I am now, but a different doctor.  Which I'll be honest, mine is kind arrogant and I'd rather not go back.  He also mentioned one in SC (about 6-7 hours away) that has good success and is MUCH cheaper.  We may actually look into that.\n\nSo where are we now?  Well, he wants to see images of my surgery before making any decisions.  But for me, I totally love him and felt super comfortable with him so I may stick around there.  Now to track down those damn images.

I am having a situation with a friend and would love your understanding selves to give me some advice.  I'm not sure who else I can talk to about this subject who will really understand.  It's a little long, but please stick with me.  \n\nI have a friend I have known since my first year of college.  She was a wonderful friend for a very long time, my best friend actually, and helped me through a lot of shit.  Two and a half years ago she got married and immediately had two kids (one of whom is my Goddaughter).  Over these past few years her attitude has changed immensely.  She has become exceedingly judgemental, especially when it comes to the subject of parenting (she went so far as to shame my sister-in-law for not breastfeeding even though she was unable to produce enough and she was emotionally exhausted). \n\nShe is also very religious and isn't afraid to hide her beliefs on many subjects.  One such rant was about how using any \"unnatural\" means to get pregnant is evil (yes, she specifically used the word evil). She also frequently states that she \"can't understand why people don't just adopt\" because she is adopted. She even went on a rant about how surrogacy is also evil because the child ends up with the DNA makings of three people. That Facebook post came when we had been trying for a while already and it just really stung. Since then, I have not reached out to make contact even though our last conversation included wanting to make plans for me to come see them. (on a side note, I've noticed it always seems to be me driving 45 min to them and always seems to end in me babysitting)\n\nI have since received multiple messages from her via Facebook and text.  The first was very accusatory, stating she was angry and there was no way her kids would recognize me etc.  The second was a little more subdued stating they had sold their house and she hopes to hear from me.  I have not yet responded. \n\nI have not told her much about our struggles with infertility.  She knows it's an issue, but I don't think she knows how it is affecting me.  She also doesn't know we are starting the process to adopt through the foster care system. I also know that both of her children were conceived immediately and she will not understand the emotional impact infertility can have on a person.  I had been hanging in there because of my Goddaughter, but I really don't know if it's worth it anymore.  I'm not sure if I can take the emotional tole this relationship may have  on me on top of everything else.  And even if we do work things out, I'm not sure if I can ever talk to her about what we will be doing to TTC without fear of being immensely judged.

This post helped me get the courage to reply. I have anxiety and typically hate confrontation, especially with things this sensitive and emotionally charged.  I sent her the following, which is directly based off of some of your replies, so thank you! \n\n\"We are struggling with infertility and are looking into treatment options. This is extremely difficult, but also extremely important to me, and I feel like you don't approve and will tell me my choices are evil based on some of your Facebook posts. Your judgement about alternate routes to parenthood is personally painful to me.  Please remember that you're judging others for struggles that you yourself have not personally experienced.\"\n\nNow I wait... \n\nEdit 2:  This is the response I received... \n\n\"I would never judge you for a choice you would make with your own family and body.  I may disagree, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't still love and support you and your potential family... I would have hoped you'd know me well enough to know that.  Been praying for you and Darin, and will continue to do so.\"\n\nSo pretty much, at least to me, this says \"this is your fault, not mine.  I'm not sorry.\" I guess I have my answer.  I'm not even sure this warrants a reply.  Sigh.

I\u2019m also taking Omnitrope for egg quality.\n\nI have some hope that this different protocol will work better for me than the previous antagonist ones.  My lining is good.  I had lots of follicles at my first ultrasound.\n\nBut the hope is limited.  I\u2019m 38. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with PCOS, hyperplasia, and hypothyroidism.   And we still don\u2019t really know what went wrong before.  We had poor fertilization rates (even with ICSI), poor embryo growth, and no blastocysts. We transferred two morulae each time, none of which ever implanted.\n\nBut whatever happens, this is our last IVF. One last try.  And there will be no hoping for a surprise pregnancy\u2014I will permanently be on hormonal birth control to prevent a hyperplasia relapse. \n\nInfertility has taken over my life for the last 4 years.  It\u2019s time to take it back. To reclaim the happy and confident person I used to be. I was too devastated after the last failure.  I can\u2019t live with this stress and anxiety any longer, especially when there\u2019s no guarantee that we will ever have success.  It\u2019s taking too much of a toll on my physical and mental health.  My emotional health.  My career.  My friendships. Our finances.  Everything.  We\u2019ve reached the point in the journey where the pain of moving on seems preferable to the pain of staying in limbo.\n\nAnd so this will be my final IVF, my final stims and retrieval. I\u2019m hoping it brings success, but I will settle for closure. We will do FETs if that is an option. But we\u2019ve decided not to pursue donor eggs.  There are too many reasons I\u2019m not comfortable with that path and I\u2019m at peace with the decision.  The adoption question is still looming.  We\u2019ve attended an orientation and done some reading and a lot of talking, and we\u2019ve decided that we\u2019re not ready to decide yet. That will come later, though I suspect it will be difficult to commit ourselves to such a daunting process.\n\nThank you, /r/infertility, for being such an amazing place of support and care.  This journey would have been so much harder without you.  And while I\u2019ll definitely be around for this cycle, if we end up with a final failure I may need to take a step back from this wonderful corner of the internet so I can grieve and try to move forward.  I\u2019m scared of the potential devastation.

We always knew I would have issues, but not him. All we ever hear is how fertile his whole family is. They all got pregnant first time. His mum constantly talks about how careful we have to be because of it. He feels like he has let everyone down. But he was also asking why we can't at least try Clomid. Even if he has a low sperm count, he wants to try and concieve naturally. I don't know enough to say why the specialise didn't prescribe it, but said that once we get more tests done, we will be able to make a more informed decision. \n \nAnyway, I guess I just wanted to introduce myself and get acquainted here.

We've done three cycles: the first was successful but I miscarried at week 8, second was successful but I miscarried at week 4 (looked like my period, found out it was a miscarriage from the HCG). Third cycle was cancelled before the stim because I had two follicles, one was good and one middling. Specialist (we don't call them RE here in Australia) thought it wasn't worth going through the rest since we'd done so much better in the previous cycles with 6 and 7 follicles.\n\nWe're doing IVF wth ICSI due to MFI and the spectre of impending menopause on my part (mum was 42 at menopause, grandma at 40). Miscarriages are likely to have something to do with our age.\n\nSo. Cancelled cycle ended a week and a bit ago and my period is due Friday. We stimmed (pregnyl -- NEVER again if I can help it) and were told to try naturally, which we did. So now I keep thinking I'm pregnant, from one and a half crappy follicles.

I wish I didn't have to be here but I am so glad that this amazing community exists. I have primarily been a lurker here and r/tryingforababy for quite some time now (I think I commented on one of the two once) but I realized tonight that now is the time for a formal introduction. I'm ready to dive in. \n\nHere is our story... In Oct. of this year my husband and will have been together for 10 years, all of my twenties! We have been married for over 2.5 of those 10 years, and those last years have been quite the roller coaster. On December 12th, 2013 my husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer. The next morning we were in the fertility clinic under an emergency appointment to bank sperm. Having children is a huge priority for us and fertility was the first thing that came to my husband's mind when he was diagnosed. Before cancer we had a tentative date of 2015 to start the baby making. Anyways, he had an orchiectomy (removal of a testicle) a couple of weeks later on December 23rd. After Christmas recovering, we learned a few weeks later that the surgery did not cure his cancer and he would need chemo. He banked sperm a few more times, but I should note that all of the banked sperm is of relatively poor quality and can only be used for IVF, likely using ICSI. \n\nHubs went through 9 grueling, horrible weeks of chemo that ended almost exactly a year ago. Chemo effected his fertility quite substantially, but we knew that ~70% of men father children after this chemo, so it was possible that in the next couple of years he would likely be \"back to normal/better.\"\n\nHe slowly recovered over last summer and we were living the high life. We even planned the 2 week trip of a lifetime to Thailand last November to celebrate how far we had come and everything we had been through together. We got back from the trip on a Friday and by Monday my husband had a regular surveillance (every 2 months-CT scan, chest xray, tumor markers, etc.) appointment to make sure the cancer didn't come back. On that Thursday, his oncologist called to say a large tumor was found and he would need surgery. \n\nLong story short, we were referred to Memorial Sloan Kettering in NYC where he had surgery to remove the tumor and 70 other lymph nodes in his abdomen to help prevent future tumors. Luckily, the tumor was a benign teratoma (which was part of his original tumor mix and is still harmful/can spread), however, the surgery (a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection) damaged the nerve responsible for forward ejaculation. So not only did we have the effects of chemo working against us, but now NOTHING COMES OUT AT ALL. We went from at least being able to give trying naturally a fair shot to having that completely taken away from us by cancer. It is possible that this could get better, but it may not, or it may take years (it is impossible to know). Before we knew about this most recent surgery, I was going to go off BC in January and we were going to try at the end of this year. I now went off birth control about 6 weeks ago (I just got my first period too, yay!) and we aren't sure when to try since IVF is most likely the only option. I have *really* grieved this, but I also feel very lucky that we have the opportunity to do IVF and that we banked sperm before chemo. If IVF is how we make our beautiful, healthy baby, then that is how it will be done! \n\nSO, here is my rant. In the last month or so we have tried to be a little bit more social as my husband is feeling more recovered after surgery. We hung out with some friends that we don't know well but really like a few weeks ago, and pretty soon after they arrived they asked us about whether we want kids. And then they pushed it a little bit. OK, we thought, we are usually open, but its hard to talk about... Harder than talking about cancer. A few days later, I was talking to the woman friend online, and she asked for details... why they couldn't \"just turkey baster me.\" It made me a little bit uncomfortable, but I understand. I really, really like her and was willing to explain. I want to be an open book to people I care about, I don't want them to feel weird, even if I do sometimes. WELL... today I commented on another friend's adorable FB post of her baby (a former college roommate, we aren't close in that we aren't involved in each others lives much, but obviously care) and she proceeded to send me a private message... \"i hope i'm not being rude/awkward, but i was wondering if you guys will still be able to have babies. i've been hoping and praying that you guys can, especially with his piercing eyes! i always feel slightly guilty posting pictures of my perfectly healthy babies when i know that there are people who may not able to.\" I was so caught off guard that I cried. It is one thing if I offer the information, but it is another thing for someone to flat out ask like this when we aren't extremely close. I feel... hurt? Maybe because I feel like she was asking to fulfill her curiosity? I don't even know. I didn't respond yet and don't know what to say. It is not in my nature to be rude or confrontational, but I just don't know what to say and I feel like she should have known better than to ask something like this. I wish people would just not pry on this subject- it is obviously sensitive. Catch me on an off day and I will cry about it in front of you. If you want that, ask away &gt;:O\n\nAnyways, I am so sorry for the wall of text. I hope that it is ok that I plan to post this in r/tryingforababy too (please let me know if it isn't). Thank you so much to anyone who read this and I hope that at some point I can offer to you some of the support that I see you ladies giving each other. Lots of baby luck and science success to all of you!\n\n**Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH. You are all so wonderful and I am incredibly grateful for your support and advice.

After we got married, we started really trying. I already knew I had some issues with fertility, so the my OB/GYN started me on 50 Mg of Clomid. We soon found out that my progesterone was very low, so at times, I had to take Provera to start my period. This was one of my problems. I was extremely irregular without BC to the point where I would go 3 to 8 months without a period. \n\nLong story short, I've been on 5 cycles  of Clomid, currently on 200 mg with no ovulation, so my Dr. just started me on Metformin to see what that will do.

It's just that I don't know anyone over there. I know many of you folks. I had to write something and I wanted to share it. \n\nNine months ago, I completed my first (and what will be my only) fresh cycle of IVF. I was one of those annoying people who found this sub when I was starting my cycle, got to know some awesome people for a couple of months, and then I stumbled out of there. I was lucky. It worked. I got pregnant. I got to experience all the first trimester things. I have three stretch marks to show for it. At thirteen weeks, I went in for a diagnostic ultrasound, which I was really looking forward to. Just three weeks earlier we had seen our little proto-would-be-baby wiggling around at our ten-week scan. It was incredible. At twelve weeks, we got the results of our genetics test: all normal. We knew we were having a girl. We had just started letting our guard down because the few people who knew told us we were being too cautious. And so we told a few others. I tentatively started googling riot grrrl onesies. We smiled in the waiting room. And then it was over. \n\nI don\u2019t remember much of the next week. I intentionally spent most of it in a drugged stupor, used up every spare narcotic I had on hand, and then found some more. One night I washed down some narcotics with alcohol and took a sleeping pill to get to sleep, knowing full well how stupid that was. I didn\u2019t care. My baby was gone.\n\nThe hell of infertility is that it\u2019s not quite hell: it\u2019s limbo. But having a miscarriage puts you in a different kind of limbo. My baby was gone. But was it a baby? Was I a parent? Was that wiggling humanesque thing my child? Is it possible to grieve someone you never knew? Something that\u2019s not a someone yet? Who am I missing? Or what am I missing? Am I missing fantasies of a life I had? Or one I\u2019ll never have? It\u2019s like time gets twisted around in this infertility-miscarriage sci-fi quantum landscape: the future is the past, the past is the future, and the present drags on for years.\n\nIt seems like most miscarriage stories are the same. Which is why, maybe, this grief is so difficult to process. The individuating part happens after birth \u2013 before, everything\u2019s the same. All ultrasounds look the same. All pregnant women talk about the same boring things. Maybe that\u2019s why it hurts so bad for infertile folks to see pregnant bellies\u2014you can so easily imagine that belly being yours. Most pregnancies are the same. Most miscarriages are the same. And maybe that\u2019s why it helps to hear from others who\u2019ve gone through it\u2014my pain is your pain, more or less. A little more pain, a little less pain. But variations on a theme.\n\nMost miscarriage stories are the same. I had it, I lost it, I hurt so bad I thought I\u2019d die. I want to die. But then it hurts a little bit less. And then a little less. And then a little less until you start to wonder if you made it all up. \n\nI guess I\u2019m writing this because I want to remind myself that I didn\u2019t make it up. Today is April 21st, and today would have been her birthday. I hold her name in a special place, because I\u2019m not sure what she was, or what she is, or what we are to each other. Her name is like a wish you hold in your mind when you\u2019re blowing the candles out. To utter it is to drain it of its magic. And so today, as I\u2019m going in for yet another appointment, and getting yet another ultrasound, and giving myself yet another shot of yet another hormone, I will say her name in my head like an incantation. Or like a birthday wish for someone else. \n\nEdit to add: Thanks for your kind words, everyone.

Now I know its usually called a DNC, but she referred to the surgery as a hysteroscopy? and from what I googled (I know it was a bad move but I had to know!) It sounds like they just put this scope in me to look around? but she told me that I will be put under so I guess why I am here is, I want to know if anyone has had this type of surgery done before.

I have highly suspected endometriosis (took me 6 years of never using BC with any partners &lt;yes, I was a fool&gt; to get pregnant by super fertile ex -in two months with him). My husband has Herschprung's syndrome and had two major abdominal surgeries as an infant to rebuild his damaged colon. These surgeries caused what we now know to be nerve damage which hinders his ejaculate from fully expelling, meaning he has super low volume. He also had the testosterone levels of a 90 year old man and was put on Clomid in November 2014 and his testosterone levels are absolutely perfect now. He was able to give his first ever SA this morning with the magic nerve stimulating powers of Sudafed and the months of Clomid all finally working together. So we are eagerly awaiting his results but know we face a fate of IVF which is being planned for September. I will have a lap surgery to investigate endo and uterine polyp removal. \n\nSo that's me, us, and our long ass stupidly frustrating journey through the universe of infertility.
