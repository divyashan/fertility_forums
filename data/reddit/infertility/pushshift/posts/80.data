It started last Saturday so nearly a week now. Lots of coughing, green phlegm, very sore throat although no fever and strep negative. I'm basically surviving on Advil right now, which I'm told I definitely cannot take once I start the cycle, but it does seem to be slowly getting better. GP wanted to give me a steroid shot and RE said no way.\n\nWell I woke up this morning with pink eye in both eyes. Apparently it can happen with colds. Doctor says it's viral, gave me some antibiotic eye drops with a steroid (in case in turns bacterial). RE says that's okay to take for the week.\n\nLastly, my stupid TSH. I was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's and my TSH has been bouncing around. Was told by RE it needs to be stable and at least under 2.5 before embryo transfer. It had been 2.7 and 3.1 in May. Got an appt with a shitty endocrinologist (only one with availability). So early June my TSH was 2.3. Been on levothyroxine 12.5mcg per day since then. Found out that as of yesterday, my TSH is now 4.1. WTFFFF. How could it have gone up? I ask the shitty endo. She says, well hormones fluctuate. K but I need it to be going the other direction. So now I'll take 25mcg per day and just hope it actually goes down before the transfer. Cool cool cool.\n\nIf you've made it this far, you are awesome and I'm sorry to bother you with all this boring crap.\n\nAnyway, my questions are :\n\n1. Can being sick with a virus hurt my IVF outcome? Like in some way worsen my egg quality or something? Surely regular people get pregnant with colds, but in this situation, it seems like the odds are even more stacked against me.\n\n2. Have you dealt with a high TSH before starting an IVF round? Were you able to successfully bring it down in time? I'm freaking out that this shitty endo should have put me on a higher dose in the first place.\n\n3. Have you had a cycle cancelled for either of the above reasons?\n\nThank you for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13854, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can being sick affect IVF outcomes?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564282141, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cic8ly/can_being_sick_affect_ivf_outcomes/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ArmandHammerBS", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_48ram5yr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564199631, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cictu6/donating_menopur/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cictu6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/cictu6/donating_menopur/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1564199633, "score": 15, "selftext": "In Seattle and have left over medication.\n\nLocal pickup only.\n\n10 vials Menopur (75 IU, 8 expire 9/20, 2 expire 8/20)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13855, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Donating Menopur", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564286005, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cictu6/donating_menopur/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564222186, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ciftkm/saturday_am_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ciftkm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 94, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ciftkm/saturday_am_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1564222187, "score": 16, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything NOT necessarily related to infertility or treatment.

Obviously, my therapist knows all of this.\n\nIn June, I told her I was starting IVF in either July or August. I also noticed she was starting to look pregnant. I didn't ask her about it, but at my last appointment, she told me she was 4 months pregnant. She asked if I wanted to keep coming back and I said I'd have to think about it. Right before our last appointment, I panicked, I felt like I just didn't want to talk to a pregnant therapist only a week before I started IVF or through IVF, it was just too much. I sent her a polite email telling her I decided to leave and asking for a rec for a new therapist. She wrote back that she wants me to come in one more time and that she is charging me for the session I missed. \n\nI do not want to go. I feel she could have told me months ago this was a possibility instead of waiting until I was about to start IVF and at my most vulnerable to tell me. On the other hand, I understand it's a personal matter and she probably didn't want to share too much and also didn't know if she'd even get pregnant. Should I go to the last appointment?

Yep!\n\nYes, society is rude to all women, but being a fertile mom is literally what society WANTS you to be. It\u2019s like white people complaining about reverse racism. Okay, sure, your kid ruined everyone else\u2019s dinner, you refused to take her out, and you got \u201cdirty looks.\u201d Oh no! How horrible that I, someone who may never have what you got easily for free, doesn\u2019t want to be around that!\n\nNormally I like to be \u201cpositive\u201d about IVF. Anxious yes, but not bitter. Well today I\u2019m bitter. Maybe because I\u2019m scared my first FET won\u2019t work but also because I am a member of a lot of FB meme groups (which mostly add joy to my life) but today someone posted a meme about women who pressure childless women to have kids.  I found it funny, as did most moms (because they\u2019re normal moms, not annoying judgy ones) but then OF COURSE this one woman who was a 23-year old mom of a healthy baby was like \u201cIM SORRY BUT THIS IS SHAMING ME IM OFFENDED\u201d\n\nOh I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re offended that people don\u2019t like being asked personal questions about their child status? Fuck right off. You get to go home and hold your baby and I\u2019m just fucking crying. How can these people take this for granted, be literally the most praised version of \u201cwoman\u201d in our society and STILL play the victim?! \n\nYes, parents have real problems. Infertile parents exist and they have real problems. But memes about not pressuring others to have kids IS NOT A PROBLEM. I wish my biggest problem was a fucking \u201coffensive\u201d meme.  Seconds later someone else posts \u201csure 6 pack abs are great but I carried a baby for 9 months my body is superhuman.\u201d Okay, I went through 2 egg retrieval\u2019s, is my body superhuman? \n\nI told this woman why the meme was funny for most women- because even women who have kids or chose not to have them don\u2019t like being pressured- and I explained that I hardly hate kids, I\u2019m doing IVF myself, and I still enjoyed it. And she still went off about \u201cBUT I FEEL SHAMED.\u201d Suck it up and enjoy your probably unplanned or cycle 1 kid you had at 22.  The other women on the thread who experienced infertility (most of whom now had kids) got the joke and weren\u2019t being ridiculous over it. \n\nAm I overreacting? Of course. Should I probably quit fb? Yes, but the memes make me laugh so it\u2019s hard and I like having some media in my life that isn\u2019t about IVF.

Husband and I had been trying for over a year and finally two months ago sought some help from a fertility specialist. Turns out I have PCOS. Husband is fine as a fiddle and got top marks on his fertility, it's just me who has the issues. My AMH was almost double what a \"normal\" women's is at 7.21. We just received all the medications the doctor wants to try first to conceive, which are currently occupying my kitchen counter. It's daunting to say the least, between pills and injections and more visits to the clinic I'm feeling really overwhelmed. Also trying not to get my hopes up that we'll be successful on the first try, or if we are that the pregnancy will \"stick\".\n\nI want right now more than ever to seek out support from friends and family, especially other women who might have been through this. But every time I think of reaching out I get depressed, sad and most of all angry at the multitude of female friends I have who have had successful pregnancies. And I've been counting: since January of this year 35+ friends and acquaintances have announced their healthy pregnancies. I keep an angry counter with tic marks that are getting more and more jagged with every fucking Facebook/Instagram announcement I see. My husband tells me to get rid of it and stop looking but I can't. And every time I see someone post another bump update or picture of a sonogram I want to punch the wall.\n\nWhat really gets to me the most are the women who use the \"miracle baby\" term for pregnancy's that I KNOW were no struggle for them.

She was only 36 yo and had gone through kidney failure and cardiac arrest. Both big failures in our eyes, and we have been mourning ever since.

\n\nit seems like every time i have an appointment with my RE it gets cancelled or changed into a phone call.  i requested an appointment with him last wednesday afternoon (before i went on vacation), and i had to practically beg for them to schedule it! he ended up just pulling me aside for 2 minutes at morning monitoring instead... and i literally hadn\u2019t even seen him in 7 weeks! since another doctor did my first egg retrieval, i saw my doctor one week prior to that, and then not again until 2.5 weeks past my first FET. \n\nnow that i am actually experiencing the physical aspects of my 5w4d loss of my top-rated, pgs normal embryo... i wanted an appointment to go over what could have gone wrong and talk about next steps. that was supposed to be this afternoon. but the clinic just called and said he\u2019d like to talk on the phone instead. am i wrong to be frustrated? is it not normal to want to meet with your RE after a loss? i have a million questions for him, and he always sounds so rushed on the phone. is it worth switching to a different doctor within the clinic?\n\n\n2. how do you handle your frustrations with your clinic (if you even have any)?\n\nmy insurance told me before we started with this clinic in december that we had ivf covered pending medical necessity. since my husband is azoospermic, it\u2019s considered medically necessary and should be covered. \n\nin the 8 months i\u2019ve been working with this clinic, they reassured me that they checked with my insurance on 4 separate occasions, and that we\u2019re subject to a state mandate that limits us to 2 lifetime rounds of ivf. i was so confused that i asked them to call my insurance back 3 additional times to verify, since that\u2019s not the information i\u2019d been given. they repeated that i only has coverage for 2 lifetime rounds of ivf... so 2 FETs total. \n\nbased on hearing this information SEVEN TIMES from my clinic, my husband and i decided we must have misunderstood my policy, and that the clinic (who must know more than we do) was had the correct information. we decided to pay 4k out of pocket for pgs testing (thinking that we\u2019d rather pay 4k we don\u2019t have in advance to avoid miscarriages- since we only have 2 rounds and can\u2019t afford to pay for ivf out of pocket). we paid the 4k, got the pgs results, had the first fet (which the clinic said had a 96-98% success rate once pregnancy was confirmed... and which ended in a CP at 5w4d last week). \n\ni called my insurance again last week, and was given the same information i received in november- that my ivf coverage has no limits per se- but that it\u2019s based on medical necessity. i called the finance people at my clinic AGAIN (for the 8th time now) to look into this- and it turns out we were right all along!  we are not limited to 2 rounds as they incorrectly told us SEVEN TIMES. while this is good news for us in the long run- my clinic provided me with the incorrect information 7 times in 8 months, and based on that misinformation, my husband and i spent 4k+ that we don\u2019t have on pgs testing. \n\nthe REs at the clinic were all aware that we were only doing pgs testing because we only had 2 shots at this- and we wanted to give it the best chance we could at working. (as an aside- one RE at the clinic advised us to do it- citing a 10% decrease in MC at my age, and another RE said he doesn\u2019t think pgs is necessary at my age, but that if i wanted to give it the best chance of working, and we only have two tries, i should do it). we NEVER would have done pgs testing if we had known that our coverage wasn\u2019t limited. \n\nso here we are. we made a $4k, non-refundable decisi\u00f3n based on misinformation provided by our clinic 7 times (even though we made them aware that we believed they were mistaken and begged them to get to the bottom of the discrepancy in information before any financial decisions were made).  i don\u2019t even expect them to refund us...  but they won\u2019t even admit they made an error or apologize at all. i find it infuriating! i have severe medical anxiety and went through the past 3 months putting SO MUCH pressure on myself that this first round HAD to work for no reason. \n\nand i still can\u2019t even get an in person appointment with my RE :(\n\ni realize how fortunate we are in the long run to have more insurance. i know that this is good news for us. it\u2019s just that- between the lack of access to communication with my RE, the misinformation provided by my clinic SEVEN TIMES which cost us 4k we don\u2019t have and SO MUCH STRESS, and the absence of an apology or admission of fault from anyone at my clinic... i feel like i\u2019m developing major trust issues with them.  i know that this clinic boasts a 70% ivf success rate- and they\u2019re located right in my city- so i\u2019m hesitant to change. at the same time though, how do i proceed with them when i feel like i\u2019m not being heard and not being given the correct information? \n\nhas anyone experienced issues like these before? are they common situations? please tell me if you feel i\u2019m in the wrong. i fully realize that my current physical &amp; mental states are not at their best (as i lay here experiencing my first MC). i\u2019m just so overwhelmed.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13891, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "RE &amp; insurance rant", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564581259, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cjs39g/re_insurance_rant/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sneakysneakysnail", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kkh2i", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564495152, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cjs57t/humor_ive_named_my_embryos/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cjs57t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/cjs57t/humor_ive_named_my_embryos/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1564495154, "score": 0, "selftext": "I had an egg retrieval a few months ago, and we decided to get \u2018em all genetically tested.

The main take away was that my PCP, who I had been seeing for fertility really had no idea what she was talking about and led us down a path that wasn\u2019t helping and may have been hurting. The main issue is that she put me on Clomid without any type of monitoring or ultrasound.\n\nWhen the RE went in for the ultrasound, he found a bunch of cysts (some rather large) on both ovaries. Because my PCP didn\u2019t do an ultrasound prior to prescribing me Clomid, we don\u2019t know if these have been there a while or are a result of the Clomid, which I have been on for 5 months. He doesn\u2019t want to do blood work yet because he said the cysts could affect the results and make them inaccurate. He is also suspicious of endometriosis based on my exam but said we need to get the cysts taken care of to see if that was the cause of my tenderness. So while he isn\u2019t completely convinced I have it, he isn\u2019t ruling it out either. \n\nSo now I am waiting until I ovulate in about 10 days to go back in to get a repeat ultrasound to check the size and volume of the cysts and to see if I ovulated on my own. Hopefully, at that point, we can start making some kind of plan and get the bloodwork but he didn\u2019t want to commit to that because he said everyone is different and while we are hoping the cysts go down or are gone, we can\u2019t treat based on hope. I made the mistake of consulting Dr. Google and saw that one of the treatments for the cysts if they don\u2019t go away on their own is birth control, which seems real counter-intuitive when TTC.\n\nI am so anxious for this next appointment. I know 10 days is nothing, but it feels like an eternity. I am also filled with a lot of disappointment and anger at my PCP and I feel really stupid for following the PCP\u2019s protocol, even though there really was no reason not to trust her. I\u2019m really scared we made this situation worse for ourselves by following the PCP\u2019s orders and not going to an RE sooner. I feel like we wasted over a year and that all the emotions and heartache we felt going through that time was actually the result of poor direction.

As I had just completed an ERA, I was also prescribed Provera. So I was taking both Synarel and Provera at the same time. I started bleeding a few days into taking this combination. I stopped Provera after about 7 days, but continued Synarel. On day 8 of Synarel I added the FSH stimulation meds (menopur and Puregon). By day 6 of FSH (plus Synarel) my estrogen skyrocketed and I grew massive follicles - many 30mm plus. In trying to understand this my RE felt I had an unusual reaction. However I\u2019ve since seen another RE who thinks the Provera + Synarel combo was the problem. I THINK the explanation was that with Synarel agonist cycle, your period confirms that your estrogen has dropped and you are downregulated. Like you wouldn\u2019t get your period unless and until your estrogen has dropped. And you would only start the FSH when your estrogen drops. Provera causes an artificial period - a withdrawal bleed. This is not the same as an actual period that indicates an estrogen drop. Consequently by taking Provera I bled and this was wrongly interpreted as a \u201cperiod\u201d which confirms estrogen drop where that may not have been the case. Starting FSH before the estrogen drop lead to amplified response to the FSH. I think that\u2019s what he said!

Little bit of an existential crisis wrapped up into all these emotions as well. \n\nHere's my main issue though. I work full-time M-F and I work with three other pregnant women. No one at work knows about my fertility issues. I'm very careful about keeping work life separate from personal life. \n\nI am truly happy for these other women who are pregnant, but I am not handling all the pregnancy/baby talk well. It's gotten to the point where I have stopped trying to act like I'm okay. I've decided that I'm really not okay and I'm done pretending to be happy etc. This means I'm doing everything I can to avoid participating in or overhearing pregnancy/baby conversations (which, btw, is alllllllllllllll these women talk about. Understandable, but omg is there nothing else to talk about in your life, Karen!?). When I am around co-workers, I have my headphones in 24/7 now. I'm avoiding all general conversations unless they have anything to do with work and I'm doing everything I can do take trips to other departments so that I can get away from it all. Even with all of this, I am constantly bombarded with baby talk/conversations. One co-worker even started bringing her baby into work to visit all the time now, which is especially hard.\n\nEverything I am going through is obviously affecting my work environment. I'm tearing up constantly, and other, non-pregnant, coworkers are starting to ask if I am feeling okay. I've started declining to attend work-related events just because I can't handle being around all the baby/pregnancy talk.\n\nSo, I'm really unhappy at my job right now. I actually do love the work that I do though, so I don't want to quit. It's also a good job with good pay, excellent benefits, and it offers loan-forgiveness! Unfortunately, I really can't see how I can be expected to continue to work in this environment and maintain any level of sanity. I keep thinking about how I'm just going to have to watch all my coworkers get pregnant and raise their kids over the years, while I am... over here having miscarriage after miscarriage apparently. \n\nI figure I have a few options moving forward:\n\n1. Continue to function with the way things are. Don't tell anyone and figure out a way to mentally process all this sorrow. \n\n2. Tell a coworker friend (who is not pregnant) that I think I could vent to. The risk with this option is entering into mixing personal life with work life. I don't want the word to get around about my fertility issues, because I don't want to take away from the joy/happiness of my pregnant coworkers. I don't want them to feel like they can't talk about their babies/pregnancy plans and I don't want anyone to feel like they have to tip-toe around me. I also don't want any pity from my coworkers.  \n\n3. Talk to my boss about maybe moving to a different department or switching to part-time? My boss and I are friendly and get along, but I don't know that involving my boss with everything that is going on with me personally is a good idea. \n\nHas anyone else encountered a situation similar to this? How do you handle all the sorrow while trying to maintain a normal work life? How do you tolerate being around several people who are pregnant and talk about baby planning, etc around you?\n\nIn the past, while TTC, I've encountered other friends or acquaintances who became pregnant, but I've never been in a situation where I am constantly bombarded daily with reminders that I am not pregnant and I may never be.\n\nAnyone have any advice or words of wisdom? I'm really struggling here. Sigh/\n\n**TL;DR:** Dealing with loss and death right now. Trying to figure out how to process all the sadness while being confronted with a lot of pregnancy/baby talk at work.

The last time I posted regularly in an online forum, I was moderating a Star Wars message board. I definitely did not think I would be on this sub 10 years later. \n\nAt some point I\u2019ll figure out how to set up my flair, but here\u2019s a little bit about me for now. 35F (36 next month - yikes time flies). Husband and I were going to start trying in July 2014, after we\u2019d been married for almost a year and my job was settling down for a few weeks. But then I was laid off and was paranoid about job hunting and affording medical care while unemployed, as I\u2019m the main breadwinner. Finally started a job 6 months later, took another 6 months to settle in, and we started. One year tracking BBT - nothing. Another year with ovulation trackers - nothing. Meanwhile, EVERYONE ELSE was getting pregnant - like, multiple times. Finally saw an RE last year. I was diagnosed with stage II endo after a lap in November, and the RE said my tubes were likely blocked. Insurance wouldn\u2019t approve IVF until after I had an HSG, so that was a fun, unnecessary, and painful time at the hospital.\n\nHad my first ER and fresh transfer in May. We were able to freeze a few embryos, but the transfer didn\u2019t work. I found that out on the last day of my job after giving my goodbye speech and realizing I still had a pile of work to do and an office to clean out. I texted my mom the result, she called and was not helpful. That\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever full on cried at work.\n\nSpent the next week at my new (current) job crashing down from progesterone and trying not to feel like dying from the awful cramps and nausea. Thankfully, I had little to nothing to do, and my supervisor was out the following week. That gave me a lot of time to really think about, well, everything. Why didn\u2019t it work, why is everyone else fertile, do I really want kids, can I even manage being a parent when I get lazy about cleaning out the litter box...\n\nNow I\u2019m in the middle of an FET cycle - transfer day is 8/19. I\u2019ve never experienced so many different emotions in such a short amount of time as I have over the past couple months. This has been rough, but I\u2019m glad this community exists because it\u2019s been really helpful. \n\nOh, and fun story about how I found you all: During the fresh cycle stims, I was complaining to my husband about the Ganirelix needle. He googled it (as he always does) and found a comment that compared the needle to a rusty nail. I googled it myself later, because I needed to see for myself that someone else thought that needle was bullshit. I found this sub. \n\nAlso, coming from a family of doctors, it\u2019s refreshing to see people discuss IF issues in scientific, medical, and snarky terms.
