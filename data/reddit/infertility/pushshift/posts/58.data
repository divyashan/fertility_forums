At 9 months I started getting concerned and bought the clear blue digital fertility monitor. After 3 months of using that and nothing I decided to see a doctor. After months of testing from both my husband and I (blood work, ultrasounds, and hsg) I was diagnosed with unexplained infertility. I than began clomid at cycle/month 18.

I'm new to the group but sadly not new to infertility.  I was wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar to me.  So far I've gone through 3 IUIs, 2 IVFs, and find out if my 3rd IVF worked this Friday.  The only thing they've found 'wrong' so far is that I have mild endometritis, or inflammation.  I took antibiotics before this 3rd IVF and am also taking daily low dose aspirin.  Unfortunately I feel the same feelings as my last two IVFs...right after the transfer I feel like my pelvic area is inflamed - it is bloated and there is a burning sensation.  It seriously feels like my body sees embryo as foreign and initiates an immune response to attack it.  Has anyone else experience anything like this?

Sometimes mentions of children/pregnancy is painful. **Unsolicited mentions does include flair** - a reminder to keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.\n\n*Set up flair which includes information on your age, diagnosis, treatment status, and current status.* This information is very helpful for our members when responding to questions.

Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.\n\n**This is a science-minded, realistic, sometimes cynical sub.** There are many communities online for people who want a more \"positive\" or \"upbeat\" experience complete with baby du$t and those who are seeking ways to \"cure\" infertility with natural remedies, gimmicks or diet cleanses have many places to go. People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).\n\n**If you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button.** The \"report\" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment.

FCI is an 11 physician practice with two IVF labs, one downtown and one in Highland Park, IL, plus nine clinics ranging from Buffalo Grove to Warrenville to Tinley Park. Each visit at every one of those clinics creates an immense amount of information, from lab results to insurance claims and processing, that all needs to be organized, analyzed, and optimized. Enter: Business Intelligence. Nick and his team works with every department to ensure that patient data is properly cared for and analyzed to provide the best patient experience possible. There are a million different moving pieces within a clinic of FCI\u2019s size, and Business Intelligence helps to ensure we\u2019re all on the same page. They\u2019re the nerds of the organization.\n\nNick and his wife are also patients of FCI, going through a six failed IUIs, a couple IVF cycles and a couple of FETs, one of which has been successful. So he knows both sides of the coin in the infertility world.\u00a0\n\n**AMA Focus of Discussion:**\n\nTake it where you want! He\u2019ll talk about anything you ask \u2013 insurance questions, what it\u2019s like to go through treatment \\(or, rather, what it\u2019s like to watch someone you love go through treatment\\), navigating all of the ins\\-and\\-outs of the treatment process, interesting behind the scenes tidbits\\* \u2013\u00a0so come with everything you\u2019ve ever been curious about. If he can\u2019t answer something, he\u2019ll definitely find someone who can.\u00a0\n\n*\\*As a rule, Fertility Centers of Illinois takes private health information VERY seriously.

So obviously, the first problem is that we only got 7 eggs.  We went through how the embryos developed - 7 retrieved, 6 mature (1 overcooked), 5 fertilized.  The good fertilization rates speak more to the quality of the sperm, which I figured.  Of the 5 embryos, one made it to blast on day 5, but it was grade DD in quality.  One arrested on day 5 and the rest grew slightly, then arrested on day 7.\n\nI had thought my fertility issues were pretty obvious.  I have Hashimoto\u2019s with really high antibodies.  I have a short luteal phase (it was nice for my RE to finally recognize that was an issue today).  I had a hydrosalpinx (which was removed after two years of trying naturally).  But apparently, it was not so obvious.  My RE said that even with all of those issues, she still considered me \u201cunexplained\u201d because I had three failed IUIs at age 29 with all of those apparent issues being addressed.  My TSH is under control, my remaining tube is clear, and my luteal phase was fixed with progesterone.\n\nWhich brings me to the million dollar question:  What can I do to improve my egg quality?  Surely I should see a nutritionist, take some more supplements in addition to CoQ10, make some lifestyle changes?\n\nAnd the answer that crushed me:  There's no additional change I could make that will be big enough to fix my egg quality.  If my BMI were way too high or way too low, maybe.  If I was a smoker, maybe.  But because I generally do everything average and my weight is pretty average, we can conclude that the reason for my poor egg quality is genetics.  \u201cYou were made this way,\u201d she said.\n\nShe did say, to be safe, that one round of IVF is not completely definitive.  It is just a snapshot of what\u2019s going on, and she wouldn\u2019t totally discount my eggs unless a second round of IVF gave us the same results.  A different \u201ccohorts\u201d of eggs might have different qualities, so a second round of IVF might find some good quality eggs.  I feel like I could never, ever do a round of IVF without PGS at this point.\n\nI honestly expected her to encourage me to see the clinic\u2019s nutritionist, sell me vitamins, and talk about a really aggressive protocol for a second round of IVF.\n\nInstead, she told me to take a break.  Take care of ourselves.  And come back when we\u2019re ready.  Be realistic, but have hope.\n\nSo, I am being realistic and my husband is holding all the hope.  I\u2019m devastated and I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s only holding it together for my benefit.\n\nWhen we\u2019re ready, she said we can try IUI with oral/injectable combo protocol.  All through stims I kept telling my husband, \u201cWhatever happens, remind me that I never want to do this again.\u201d  And here I am, hoping he finds a job with insurance that covers IVF, so we can do it again in a year or two.\n\nBut right now I am ready for a break.\n\nWe\u2019re going to move out of our apartment and start fresh.  Distraction and a new beginning.  I can\u2019t wrap my head around any of this quite yet and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to quit.  But I\u2019m feeling a bit more closure.  We got a few gift baskets and things from our friends, which brings me a bit of closure on all the negative feelings I was having towards them for not understanding.  Now they get it and I\u2019m happy to have their support.  I\u2019m glad to have a clearer picture of why none of this has been working.  But i can\u2019t make sense of it, and I can\u2019t understand why.\n\nI\u2019m going to hang out at /r/IFchildfree for a while.  I don\u2019t know if this is really a break or if this is the end, but whatever it is\u2026 I\u2019m so thankful to have found this community during this crazy, shitty time.

I suffer from infertility; I have hypothyroidism, insulin resistance, and polycystic ovary syndrome. I\u2019m 27 years old and I\u2019ve been with my husband since I was 21, we\u2019ve been married just under a year. We always wanted children together eventually. The rule was after I turned 25 whatever happened happened. We had a pregnancy \u201cscare\u201d a couple months after my 25th birthday; after the tests came up negative we both realized how much we wanted kids, we weren't married yet and that was something we wanted but the desire was still there, so we went back-and-forth between trying and not trying for a little over a year before we got married. Due to my known conditions we started seeing a fertility specialist just before the wedding; We\u2019ve been trying now every month we could for the past year and its heart breaking. When I started out I didn\u2019t think I would get pregnant the first shot but I also didn\u2019t think it would take this long. A year ago me was so happy because I had my whole future ahead of me and I knew that even though I had problems they were treatable and I was finally getting the treatment I needed.  I hadn\u2019t tried Fertility medications, special diets, temping, aspirin, storks, preseed, metformin, fertility massage, and so on and so on, But now that I have tried all those things and more I\u2019ve lost my hope. Baby making sex has become a chore, and the look of disappointment in my husbands eyes every time the tests turn up negative kills me. Nothing is safe to do or even think anymore because it might upset me, wanting something so bad and trying so hard and still not getting it crushes your soul, but last month you could say all the stars aligned we just knew I was going to get pregnant that month. I\u2019d lost weight, all my hormones had been regulated, it was the 1st month I had a 28 day cycle with a day 14 ovulation and 3 months ago I even had a dream where a year in the future I had a baby, this was it, it was going to work. We had sex every second day in my fertile week and waited super excited, Me watching for everything that might be a pregnancy symptom. I even got a onesie made to surprise my hubby with when I announced and I picked out the perfect teddy bear to give to our future baby, I was so sure. I\u2019ve been at this for awhile now and knew the disappointment that comes along with a negative test, so I said I wasn\u2019t going to test early because it might be to early to come up positive and I didn\u2019t need that kind of negativity affecting me and my baby. But the wait was too much and we decided to test on day 11... it was negative. I was in denial so I took 3 different brands of tests hoping one might show something. Nothing, but even though I knew I wasn\u2019t out yet, I was crushed and decided to have a cheat day on my diet. I wanted comfort, I wanted carbs, so I had some, and later that night the reaction my body had to cheating on my diet was to start my period early, I was out, all hope was gone again. It was one of the worst days of my life. Normally on my period ill relax a little on my diet, so I said screw it I\u2019ll enjoy myself and eat normally with my husband because he\u2019s been missing out too due to my diet. It\u2019s the last day of my period now and I feel horrible due to eating a normal diet and I\u2019m up 5 pounds of water weight. I\u2019ve been replaying a song over and over again while wallowing in my pity and it made me realize that even though it\u2019s so hard and I want it all to stop. There is nothing I want more then a child of our own. I don\u2019t care how heartbreaking and difficult this all is I want a child more. I\u2019m going to keep fighting,I\u2019m going back on my diet and in 10 days when I get my positive opk we\u2019re gonna try again. I set up an appointment with our fertility specialist next month to discuss the next step in treatments, and we put our tax return in our savings to help pay for those treatments. I know that every month I may be disappointed but I\u2019ll be more disappointed if I give up on my dreams, so to everyone out there who read this far and is still suffering, keep fighting because our dreams are worth it and one day they might come true.

But one of the couples is pregnant. \n\nNate and Jeremiah by design-mention of a complication with their surrogate and how she needs surgery. It ends up being fine. \n\nThe Resident-Glad this one is back, no triggers. Just handsome Matt Czuchey. \n\nWestworld is back!! I haven't watched it yet :( But heard there might be triggers.\n\nGrey's-Looking forward to their take on the #metoo stuff this week. \n\nCode Black is back tonight, not sure why I'm even still watching this, but I do like the Rob Lowe role on it. I still don't understand why they switched up the cast and took off Christa on the first season.\n\nI saw Chappaquiddick and it was actually pretty well done.

I will try to be as brief as possible.  So basically our journey started this way. \n\nwe are both 37 and my wife is the one trying to get pregnant. We have been trying for the past 2 and a half years. Our attempts include 11 IUI and 5 IVF. We have also tried 3 different donors so far and everytime we had negative pregnancy result. \n\nSo far the reason is unexplained. Also , we live in germany and hence PGD or any form of genetic testing is legally not allowed. Also egg or embryo adoption is forbidden. \n\nCurrently we are considering spain as a potential country for treatment. we have a list of questions (due to our previous experience with IVF) which we have listed to enquire when we discuss with the fertility clinics. But since we would be travelling for the whole duration, i have also added some additional questions,\n\n1. How long do we have to spend and how often?\n\n2.

I was here for a bit back in the fall after my husband and I were told we\u2019d likely require IVF/ICSI due to MFI. The rest of our fertility workup actually ended up being normal, and even my husband\u2019s third semen analysis ended up being quasi-normal (low-normal count but only 1% morphology). So, our doctor recommended we try naturally for a few more months before launching in to IVF. We did, and miraculously, got pregnant. The 4 months I was pregnant were the happiest time in my life. And then a routine ultrasound showed significant abnormalities, our daughter was diagnosed with Trisomy 18, and we lost her.\n\nSo now I\u2019m back. Even friends and family who know that we struggled to conceive are *so confident* that the fact we got pregnant once means we\u2019ll easily get pregnant again and have a healthy child soon. Obviously, the fact that we got pregnant once is extremely encouraging, and I am so grateful to have had the experience of getting two lines on a home pregnancy test and feeling pregnant even for just a short time. I know so many here aren\u2019t so lucky, and I hesitated even to post here again because I almost feel ashamed complaining to all of you.\n\nTrisomy 18 is a rare, random chromosomal abnormality due to an error in cell division early in the embryo\u2019s life. Sometimes it can be hereditary if one parent has a balanced translocation, but that is not the case for us. Typically, non-hereditary forms of T18 are not thought to be directly related to medical issues resulting in infertility or subfertility, and yet aneuploidies like T18 do become more likely as women age, so it\u2019s not *entirely* random. I\u2019m 30 and had a normal AMH, follicle count, etc, so my eggs are probably (although not certainly) okay. My husband\u2019s urologist was unconcerned about his low morphology (he thinks the criteria are way too strict, rendering the measurement meaningless\u2014and he also said the lab would have commented on any abnormalities severe enough to be concerning). But I can\u2019t help but wonder if there might be some connection to our daughter\u2019s diagnosis. Has anyone here been told anything or read anything regarding low sperm morphology and risk of aneuploidy? On a quick pubmed search, I didn\u2019t find anything compelling except in the case of couples with recurrent losses or IVF failures (which isn\u2019t us, yet).\n\nThank you for being such a wonderful community. I got so much support here last year. I\u2019m not sure how I would have dealt with all of that without this place.\n\n**tl;dr Initially were told we\u2019d need IVF/ICSI but then somehow got pregnant naturally.

I have PCOS, hypothyroidism (taking 75mcg Synthroid) and I had a laparoscopic surgery in Nov 2017 where they found slight endometriosis and one blocked tube. We moved to IVF and in mid Feb 2018 we had an egg retrieval with 8 frozen embryos. April 6, 2018 we had our first embryo transfer. Protocol was bcp, lupron overlapping with the last few bcp, period and monitoring ultrasound on cd2 and started estrogen pills and patches and baby aspirin, stopped lupron a week later, started progesterone PIO and Crinone two weeks from starting estrogen and had a transfer on the sixth day. My cycle resulted in a negative. The only symptoms I had were knuckle and joint pain on 4dpt and 6dpt, which led me to researching about NK cell issues.

Once they've confirmed ovulation and my P2 levels are above 2, they start me on estrogen patches and Ganirelix. Last round, I ovulated really late (day 21 out of what became a normal 28 day cycle; by then my P2 levels were over 3). So basically, I had a really long follicular phase, very short luteal phase. My clinic ended up bringing me back 3 times before giving me the go-ahead to start priming.\n\nThis time, I came in on Day 18. P2 was only 1.4 and the u/s confirmed I still had an egg growing. So far, not too surprising. I came back 4 days later for just blood work and my P2 had dropped to 1. Based on the usual physical symptoms, I'm pretty sure I ovulated between the two appointments but the drop off in P2 was pretty crazy.

I had my DOR (FSH 14, AFC 15, AMH 1.3) diagnosis confirmed this week after my first retrieval yielded 5/14 mature eggs. My RE says that other than taking a prenatal there's not much I can do lifestyle wise and he's still giving us a 50% chance with each transfer, even though our remaining embryo is 4BC. I'm worried he's just giving us generic advice. I've tried reading a few papers on pubmed and the evidence seems mixed. I'm taking 200mg DHEA daily anyway. The AMAs this week seemed mixed on this. I'd love to think that Dr Aimee's recommendations would help but it feels silly to go against my RE's advice. I've got a FET coming up but after my first failed transfer I've been losing hope and am thinking that another retrieval is likely. Should I be doing everything even remotely possible to help those future eggs or should I just follow my RE's advice? \n\nEDIT: typo", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8352, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "DOR supplement confusion!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8fkvwf/dor_supplement_confusion/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "ohnobingo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1524932204, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8fkvz7/whats_important_to_ask_before_first_ivf/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8fkvz7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/8fkvz7/whats_important_to_ask_before_first_ivf/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1524935054, "rte_mode": "richtext", "score": 10, "selftext": "\\(Long time lurker, first time poster. Please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong! This community has been the one small spot of sanity for me during this process and I don't want to break the rules.\\)\n\nMr. Bingo and I have been trying for two years now. We focused on trying to improve his SA results over the past year with no luck. The opposite actually \\- borderline bad at the start to pretty severe by the end. During this time we did try three cycles on Clomid even though I ovulate fine. The doctor's thought was maybe if I produced more eggs those poor lost sperm would have a better chance of finding one of them. \n\nIt's time to move on to IVF with ICSI now and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed despite/because of the many hours of research I've done. I already have a million questions but want to make sure we don't forget to ask anything at the start that's really important. We're switching clinics due to some exaperating nonsense at the last clinic as well as their sketchy SART outcome data \\(as many preterm twins as healthy singletons\\). So this will be a brand new doctor for us, not just a new procedure. \n\nWhat do you wish you had asked your doctor before your first round of IVF? Or what did you ask that ended up being really important to know?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8352, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What's important to ask before first IVF?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8fkvz7/whats_important_to_ask_before_first_ivf/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1524940578, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8flsva/saturday_afternoon_discussion_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8flsva", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 54, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/8flsva/saturday_afternoon_discussion_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1524943433, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

My fiance was diagnosed with cancer last May and went through 4 rounds of chemo, a surgery, then 2 more rounds of chemo. He was able to bank sperm before starting treatment (not enough for IUI unfortunately). His latest sperm analysis showed 5 million sperm and 0% motility. I am just wondering what your REs have said about protocols and such or any success/failure stories. I just want to know what to expect and its kind of hard to find people that are going through infertility because of chemo.
