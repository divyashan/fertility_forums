Maybe 10% reduction in pay rather than a proportional 20% reduction. Or maybe they would let me do 35 hours or something. As I said to him, I know I will still be doing the same amount work. So I really feel like a 20% reduction in pay is not reflective of the work I will be doing. \n\nI guess our company has a corporate program in place for this type of thing, and if you go through the program, you have to reduce salary by 20% in order to reduce hours.  Otherwise my department would have to make an special exception for me... which they are not comfortable doing outside of the corporate structure. \n\nI am embarrassed but I cried in my meeting. I can't help it, I am so disappointed. We can't afford to take a hit like that to my salary. At the same time, I feel like I am barely making it through each week  and my performance is suffering. I overslept twice this week and have been struggling to make it in at a consistent time. I really feel like if I could have an extra day off to handle the shit show that is my life right now, I would be able to come in and give 100% the 4 days I am at the office. \n\nSo I will talk to HR about this corporate program - there are apparently options other than reducing hours- but I have really lost hope that there will be anything helpful to come out of it. \n\nI feel like a whiny asshole bc I know there are worse problems to have and I have a good job and am lucky for the flexibility they have given me so far.

Had testing that month. Unexplained. Didn't start treatment until the next cycle, which is pretty standard.\n\nSince then I've had 13 cycles. Two were annovulatory. One was a super early ovulation which screwed up the next cycle because I didn't have my meds yet. Two were benched for cysts. Five were technically treatment cycles, though only three made it to trigger (two with TI, one IUI). The other two were cancelled due to a weird response that wasn't deemed worth saving or just no response on the correct side. Two were sat out voluntarily due to traveling/holidays. Two (including one of the annovulatory ones) were lost due to hypothyroidism diagnosis.\n\nThe original plan was 3 medicated TI and 2 IUI with injectables before moving on to IVF. I expected that to take about 9 months, allowing a couple of months for resting in between some cycles. It's been 14 months now and I still haven't finished that second IUI. I'd hoped to be starting IVF about now, based on my expected timeline.\n\nAnd it's not like it's just one thing that we can 'fix'.

He safely arrived after 6 pregnancy losses and 7 babies, after 5 years of a long struggle and he was conceived naturally with a dysfunctional left ovary and a blocked right tube. He is my 8th color of the rainbow and my first baby on earth. You are so strong women! You are all warriors! I know how hard it is. I am hugging you all and sending you lots of baby dust.

I've been lurking around here for the last month or two. Yesterday I got the genetic testing results of my first IVF and we have no normal embryos. I have a follow up scheduled with my RE to discuss options, I suppose at this point I'm just wanting to vent / whine. \n\nI have had a chronic illness for the last 15 years that's very well controlled with medication. Unfortunately the medication causes fetal harm, so I have been stuck unable to get pregnant while on meds, unable to go off meds long enough to get pregnant. The older I got, the worse the situation - my illness will have gotten worse, though suppressed by meds, and average time to conceive getting longer. \n\nA year ago my husband and I came into some money. I wanted to use some of it to do IVF.  Stop the meds, get pregnant ASAP, have the baby, go back on them. He agreed, and we decided to wait until this year. When the time came, he started to express concerns about the costs, the taxes involved (the money's in an IRA). Fine. I borrowed $31k against my 401k and made an appointment with an RE. \n\nStarted with HSG which I did NOT enjoy, a million other tests. Everything on me and my husband appears normal. The RE had me on what sounds like a pretty typical stim cycle, but anyone whose done it knows it just sucks. Finally did my egg retrieval.. wish I'd read a bit about aftercare for that, didn't know about Gatorade / salty foods, and I was painfully bloated for a week. \n\nBut the good news was that we got 12 eggs, 7 mature, 2 others matured after ER. 4 fertilized normally, 2 others may or may not have fertilized normally. On day 3 I had 2 'fair' embryos and the rest were 'poor'. On day 5/6 we had one blast. Off to genetic testing. I got the call yesterday that it came back abnormal. I'm so glad that I was off work. I cried off and on all day. \n\nThe egg stim cycle and testing cost me over $15k, all told and I have nothing to show for it. The REs office says she wants to try a different protocol next cycle, but financially this next round will need to be my last. I'm afraid my egg quality is just poor and there's nothing to be done about it. Even if we got one or two embryos next time, there's still the chance of miscarriage. \n\nSo.. my heart's broken. Maybe I'm taking this too hard. Today is my 40th birthday. My mother (who got pregnant by accident at 43) will call me and is definitely going to ask about the genetic testing. I think I'll tell her we haven't heard.

She has only been TTC for a few months, but decided to go ahead and get a full spectrum of tests done (I told her how lucky she is to be in a country with govt. healthcare where most of this will be covered for her - including IVF treatment if needed!)to prepare for the possibility or find out if she will need fertility treatments.  (She seems to think she will probably need ART but that's not been confirmed yet.) \n\nWhile discussing the increased risks of birth defects and issues with pregnancy after 40 and her options she said something that got me thinking. Do people (without known fertility issues) ever decide to do IVF due to the advantages it could offer women of \"advanced maternal age\"?  \n\nWe got on the subject thanks to discussing the PGS/PGD testing option, though that's not the only reason.  We both have fears (probably like many women) of getting pregnant only to find three months down the road that there is a genetic defect or problem that makes the pregnancy non-viable. I won't go into lengthy medical histories but there are a few things in her husband's family that makes her worry about genetic issues a little more than most. The issues aren't anything on their own that the doctor thinks would require IVF for medical reasons. (I know some people that have specific known genetic conditions chose IVF to ensure those genes are not passed on to their children, but her case is not one of those.)   \n\nBut the idea that pregnancy via IVF could remove that so many dangers/issues before ever getting pregnant is very attractive (even with all you have to go through to do IVF a viable, healthy baby is the most important thing and if IVF increases those odds the BS would be worth it.) \n\nSo I come to this thread with its encyclopedic knowledge to ask if AMA pregnancies with IVF are known to be healthier/more likely to be viable than natural AMA pregnancies - or is there really no difference? (This would be IVF with your own eggs, not DE) \n\nI've looked everywhere online but can't really find any information on this or data that compares the two. (It could be out there but I just can't find it if it is.)  Have any of your RE's ever commented on the advantages of IVF's pregnancies via natural conceptions?  Any suggest that IVF increases the chances of a healthy, viable pregnancy of women of AMA?  \n\nI would be very grateful if anyone could take a moment to share their knowledge or shed some light on this issue.

Ignore the stupid article title, just leaving it in for reference for folks who have access to the journal.\n\nCan flu shots help women get pregnant?\n\nMitch Leslie\n\n+\u00a0See all authors and affiliations\n\nScience\u00a0\u00a024 Mar 2017:\nVol. 355, Issue 6331, pp. 1247-1248\nDOI: 10.1126/science.355.6331.1247\n\nAs a veteran of three in vitro fertility (IVF) procedures, or cycles, Melody Vopni was accustomed to injections. She'd gotten used to giving herself 40 or more shots of drugs that up the ovaries' production of eggs, as well as the more painful shot that spurs ovulation. \u201cIt has a 1.5-inch needle,\u201d says Vopni, 35, a former flight attendant who lives in Austin, Texas. \u201cIt is intimidating.\u201d So when doctors at the Center for Human Reproduction in New York City told her that getting another injection could boost her odds of getting pregnant, she agreed. \u201cWhat's one more shot, right, and this one I didn't have to give to myself,\u201d she says.\n\nVopni joined one of two clinical trials that are now trying to determine whether an unlikely measure\u2014giving women flu shots before they begin an IVF cycle\u2014can improve IVF's success rates. Norbert Gleicher, the chief scientist of the Center for Human Reproduction, and colleagues launched the trials earlier this year. They argue that the vaccinations will increase the chances of implantation by spurring the woman's immune system to accept the embryo, inducing what researchers refer to as immunological tolerance. \u201cIf our hypothesis is correct, we should see better implantation rates in the IVF cycle and fewer miscarriages,\u201d says Gleicher, a reproductive immunologist.\n\nGiven that a single cycle of IVF typically costs more than $15,000, but less than one-third of the procedures result in healthy babies, any increase in effectiveness would have a big impact. This strategy \u201cis really novel and exciting, and it has the potential to deliver some benefit,\u201d says immunologist Sarah Robertson of the University of Adelaide in Australia, who isn't connected to the trials. But the approach also faces skepticism, deepened by the poor track record of past efforts to boost reproduction by manipulating the immune system.\n\nFor decades, scientists and doctors assumed that the relationship between the embryo and the mother's immune system is hostile. Like a transplanted organ, the argument went, an embryo is a foreign body teeming with unfamiliar molecules, known as antigens, that rile up maternal immune cells. To prevent the baby from being destroyed in the womb, the mother's body has to turn down the immune system for 9 months.\n\nData suggesting that flu vaccine shots during pregnancy reduce stillbirths or premature births have led researchers to launch two clinical trials evaluating whether such immunizations may also help women using IVF become and stay pregnant.\n\nMethods to reduce miscarriage risk were supposed to aid this process. One entails dosing women with the same immune-suppressing corticosteroids that prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. Although some fertility doctors still use this method, claiming that it improves pregnancy chances for IVF, Robertson dismisses it as \u201cnot safe or effective.\u201d\n\nAnother, more contentious approach was the brainchild of Alan Beer. Nearly 40 years ago, Beer, then an OB-GYN and researcher at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, began performing a procedure called lymphocyte immune therapy (LIT). LIT involved injecting white blood cells from the father into the would-be mother to prevent her immune system from attacking the embryo's foreign antigens. It didn't work, a 1999 study by researchers at the University of Chicago and other institutions concluded, and in 2002 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration put a stop to its use as a fertility treatment in the United States.\n\nWith the flu shot trials, Gleicher and colleagues predict, there's a better chance of success because the approach meshes with new understanding of the immune system's relationship with reproduction. \u201cWhat's emerging is that you must have a strong and active immune system for healthy pregnancy,\u201d Robertson says.\n\nAs scientists have learned, the immune system orchestrates key steps in reproduction. A surge of inflammation-promoting molecules helps refurbish the lining of the uterus into a cozy home for the embryo, for instance. Nine months later, another rush of these molecules helps incite labor.\n\nResearchers also have developed a more nuanced concept of tolerance, a detente between the mother's immune system and the embryo. Tolerance doesn't mean turning off the immune system, they have realized. \u201cPregnant women are not immune suppressed,\u201d emphasizes reproductive immunologist Gil Mor of Yale School of Medicine. Instead, he says, the immune system remains vigorous but learns not to target antigens on the embryo.\n\nA series of recent studies gave Gleicher and colleagues the idea that flu shots could promote tolerance. One 2016 paper, for instance, reported that stillbirths were half as common in women who received a flu shot during pregnancy.\n\nAnother study, also published in 2016, determined that women in Laos who had gotten the vaccinations were 41% less likely to give birth prematurely. Gleicher proposes that the shots work by stimulating molecular pathways that keep tolerance from breaking down too soon. And, he asks, \u201cIf influenza vaccination can have this effect late in pregnancy, why should it not have this effect early in pregnancy as well?\u201d The injections, he and his collaborators thought, might help induce tolerance and improve the odds in IVF.\n\nIn one of the new studies, women will receive a flu shot or a placebo injection 10 days before they begin an IVF cycle. The researchers will evaluate whether the women who got the real vaccines were more likely to become pregnant. They will also monitor levels of immune molecules in the women's blood to determine if tolerance ensued. The second trial will follow the same procedure except that the women seeking to become pregnant will receive embryos created from donor eggs instead of their own eggs. To be sure that they detect any benefits, the researchers hope to enlist other fertility clinics and study nearly 1500 women. Funding for the trials comes from the Center for Human Reproduction and the Foundation for Reproductive Medicine, a New York\u2013based nonprofit.\n\nBecause organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization endorse seasonal flu vaccines for pregnant women, the trials are not putting the participants in any danger, Robertson and Mor say. (In fact, all the women will ultimately get the vaccine.) And if the trials find positive results, fertility clinics could start offering the shots immediately.\n\nBut Mor is skeptical of the strategy. The immune system doesn't become universally benign during pregnancy, he says. It only becomes tolerant to specific antigens on the embryo. \u201cThe vaccine doesn't have those antigens,\u201d Mor says. And even Gleicher admits that any impact on fertility will be limited because researchers suspect that only about 15% of miscarriages result from lack of tolerance; most occur because the embryo has chromosome abnormalities, which the flu shots won't affect.\n\nVopni, who received her first shot in January, was one of the first patients in the trial to undergo IVF. She did not get pregnant. Maybe the flu shot made no difference for her, or maybe she received the placebo. \u201cI wish it had worked,\u201d she says, adding that she doesn't regret participating. \u201cIt was like, \u2018What could it hurt to give it a try?\u2019\u201d", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Interesting clinical trial mentioned in Science today", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/61sz4a/interesting_clinical_trial_mentioned_in_science/"}, {"author": "baileycoraline", "author_created_utc": 1463066690, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "29F,unexplained,IVF#1 April", "author_fullname": "t2_xvp9z", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1490630362, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/61t09r/cd_to_start_stim_injections/", "gilded": 0, "id": "61t09r", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 19, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/61t09r/cd_to_start_stim_injections/", "retrieved_on": 1492456026, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi all, just had my baseline scan for IVF #1.

I have a very complex history with sex, including my husband getting a chronic illness and us not having sex (or much intimacy at all) for a while. We weren't even in the best place relationship-wise before his diagnosis. Then on top of the illness, which is really just more under control recently, we started TTC. This led to forced, scheduled sex which killed my sex drive even more.\n\nI get a posterior fourchette tear from sex quite often, which is quite painful. This deters me. My thyroid has also been low for a long time, which I wondered if that was affecting my sex drive as it's a \"symptom\" of hypothyroidism. But that's been under control for quite some time. Now I think I'm anemic, and maybe that's causing it.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I feel less attracted to my husband right now. He's overweight and has been on a streak of eating so poorly, I just find it a huge turnoff that he isn't taking care of himself.\n\nAnyway, through infertility we have really, really struggled to get \"connected\" again. Up until recently, he didn't even want to do IVF, so we were feeling quite distant. We didn't seem to want the same things. He has come around, and we are working through our issues. Maybe we just lack passion in our relationship right now. I know throughout your marriage, you can have hot and cold parts. I'm really hoping I can turn things around.\n\nI just feel like life has thrown us so many curve balls... It's been hard to stay together and afloat through his illness and infertility. I don't want to be too hard on our relationship, but I also want us to both be happy. He's my best friend, he's an amazing man and I don't want to lose him. Obviously we're trying to have a baby, so I do want to stay in this marriage. I just want more from it. Maybe this is simply \"use it or lose it\" and because we don't have sex often, I'm just out of routine.\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far!

I mainly lurk here with an occasional comment if I have knowledge or experience to share, but ya'll are so smart and stuff that I rarely have anything meaningful to add. So since you guys are so damn smart I need some to explain WTAF is happening. \nSo Husband and I saw an RE (five hours away!) and they had my dude give a sample for a repeat SA and DNA testing (Background: SAs went from borderline to about 3 million in six months, no idea why, then we started Clomid, and after three months went up to about 28 million total). At the SA in January, we got great news- Count was a ll the way up to 88 mill total! Moph was low at 1%, but we all know that a little eh anyway. He also had WBC, so we started him on antibiotics (Side question: could the infection have caused morph issues?, before this time, we always had 9-18 % morph, so 1 was quite a drop!). His DNa stuff came back as pretty borderline too. DNI was 15% and HDS was 26%. Definitely not what we wanted to see, but not the end of the world, I guess? Could the infection have caused the DNA issues? \nLast thing and most importantly- We decided to try an IUI since the count was so good. I went in yesterday for a follicle check and we were going to trigger and do an IUI all at once (and then a second IUI in 24 hours, don't ask me why). Well we went ahead and Husband gave his sample. They found zero sperm. Doc said he looked over the entire sample, had another doctor come in, and they literally found zero. I don't know how it's possible to go from 88 million to zero?? And then the doc says to come back in today (which is fine because it gives my 18 follicle time to grow a tad more) but is it even possible? He said it's possible we will have sperm today but I just don't know how that can be. He did say the seemed normal otherwise. He saw regular debris, cells, etc. So it doesn't seem like it was a lab error or the sample was too small or anything.

My second pregnancy I had an awful time trying to get pregnant again, and conceived after an hsg about 14 months after my first miscarriage. I lost that pregnancy at 10 weeks due to triploidy. We were devastated as we'd seen the heartbeat.\n\nSo now here I am 6 months after my 2nd miscarriage, and I'm pretty sure my 2nd IUI has failed. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel so lost and helpless. Both my husband and I feel stuck in trying to conceive hell. It's like a terrible merry go round I can't escape.

I feel very alone in my infertility and although I wish none of us were in this situation, it helps to hear other stories.\n\nI have PCOS and started seeing an RE about 9 months ago. I did one cycle of femera and then two cycles of clomid with induced periods from provera each time. It's hard for me to believe it was only three cycles but each one ended up being between 50-60 days by the time I finally got a period. I might have ovulated with the last cycle- day 21 bloodwork was borderline.\n\nConsidering what so many couples go through, I know that treatment sounds promising and easy. The problem is that I had extremely severe reactions to the medications- I ended up missing weeks of work from debilitating nausea, fatigue and anxiety. I try not to be too dramatic but to be honest, I was bedridden for much of that time and was told that I will likely have hyperemesis if I do manage to get pregnant. I have struggled with depression since my late teens- I'm in my thirties now- and it got to the point where my husband and I decided to stop treatment so I could get my physical and mental health back on track. \n\nAfter feeling progressively better- aside from frequent bilateral cysts- since I stopped treatment, the reality of the situation- that I'll have to return to that place- is starting to hit me and I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through this again. I hear of so many women who battle through for so long and go through so much worse than me and I feel so ashamed and so guilty- how can I give up after just three cycles of oral meds? I don't know for certain I'll be sick during a pregnancy and I can't guarantee I'll have perinatal depression but I know it's a high likelihood for both given that I'd be entering a pregnancy with my reserves already drained. Had anyone experienced this point- where you've crossed the line between coping into suffering?

Families who choose to work with an adoption attorney on these independent adoptions typically take an active role in identifying the child they hope to adopt or a birth mother.**\n\n \nSo, I've decided that the next person who says that to me will receive a reply of, \"Here's how much it costs, when can I expect a check in the mail? Because if you are this interested in it, I expect that you're the one who will be paying for me to buy a baby, right?\" Seriously. Friend, family member, at this point, I do not care. If anyone says that to me one more time, I will let it all out.\n\n \nBecause that is essentially what I would be doing-buying a baby. Isn't that illegal in most countries? Oh but not this one, because they slap an \"adoption\" sticker over the \"purchase\" stamp, and what do you know! It's legal now!\n\n \n\nAnd IVF? **We. Cannot. Afford. It.** So, sweet aunts of mine, just because you can pay for it, doesn't mean I can.\n\n\nI'm not a baby mill. I don't exist simply to pop kids out. So, stop acting like I am not a real FUCKING woman unless I carry a kid to term. And stop telling me, \"You could have had that baby, if you had done this differently.\" \n\n\nStop posting things like, \"THIS is love-opening baby shower gifts with your husband.\" \n\n\nNo-love is that husband holding your hair back while you vomit, and he's having to hold his hand over his mouth because the sound of YOU throwing up is making him have to throw up. Love is having a shouting match in the laundry room, and he misspeaks, and says, \"....it's not like I did that on porpoise,\" and all you can think to say is, \"WHALE?\" Which then makes you both bust out laughing and he grabs you and holds you while you cry and say you're sorry for saying what you did about him. And his mom. Love is when you fight, and got to bed angry, right when a thunderstorm is starting up, and lightning flashes...and you feel a hand on your shoulder and a barely audible, \"Shhhh, it's okay, I'm right here,\" behind you.\n\n\nBut most of all, love is that husband holding you while you cry when you just got another BFN and you are on Day 42 of your cycle, and you still haven't started your period yet. Because even though he's trying to keep it quiet, you know he's crying too.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I promise you, I am going to lose it soon (rant)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6284n5/i_promise_you_i_am_going_to_lose_it_soon_rant/"}, {"author": "Miracle4us", "author_created_utc": 1490807101, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_16lkhu", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1490809638, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6287al/iso_ivf_meds_we_all_know_the_struggle/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6287al", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6287al/iso_ivf_meds_we_all_know_the_struggle/", "retrieved_on": 1492465536, "score": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Iso ivf meds we all know the struggle", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6287al/iso_ivf_meds_we_all_know_the_struggle/"}, {"author": "CatyDuck", "author_created_utc": 1481585848, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "33, 2mcs, 2 failed IUIs, hateful uterus", "author_fullname": "t2_13iuj3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1490814634, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/628qqt/afternoon_daily_thread_wednesday/", "gilded": 0, "id": "628qqt", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 132, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/628qqt/afternoon_daily_thread_wednesday/", "retrieved_on": 1492465850, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "You know what to do :) ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Afternoon Daily Thread (Wednesday)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/628qqt/afternoon_daily_thread_wednesday/"}, {"author": "LauraElizBeth", "author_created_utc": 1489689224, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_168r3c", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1490815037, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/628saf/how_to_deal_with_an_upcoming_family_christening/", "gilded": 0, "id": "628saf", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/628saf/how_to_deal_with_an_upcoming_family_christening/", "retrieved_on": 1492465871, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi all, next week is my sister in law's baby's christening weekend and I'm dreaddding it.

My mom and I have been very low contact for a over a year, it's very complicated. But I asked her to give me space. So she only knows about my infertility through what very little I tell my sister, which isn't a lot because I know she'll tell my mom. She sent me this text this morning, and I'm not sure how to respond.\n\n\n*\"The thought crossed my mind that any challenge can be overcome if the solution is greater than the challenge.\u00a0 And if the solution dwarfs the challenge then the quicker the challenge is overcome. \n\nI hope you will excuse the  uninvited invasion but I was considering the difficulty you guys have had getting pregnant.\u00a0 \n\nI think that by design our body systems are created to work together in harmony and support. When one system is shut down a cascade affect can be the result. Likewise one system can support and compensate for another to a point. \n\nI was thinking what might help and I have a few suggestions. \n\nBody brushing invigorates the endocrine system and gets it moving. It is extremely refreshing.\u00a0 You'd love it. \n\nOrganic lemon and water first thing in the morning after your night fast supports the liver and kidneys in releasing the toxins they've been cleaning from your system all night. \n\nFenugreek is a tonic for female organs and can be used in tea although it's extremely bitter.\u00a0 It's one seed that I sprout and add to my sprout salad and it is yummy and powerful. Way more powerful than herbal teas.\n\nLiving foods (sprouts) have a life force that when ingested support your own. Alfalfa sprouts are known to increase fertility. The Sprout People are an online resource that have a nice selection of seeds, supplies, and information.\"*\n\nMy mom isn't a fan of modern medicine, though she's not totally against it. She just thinks the body can heal itself 99% of the time. She has no idea the last few weeks I've been taking drugs everyday for my first medicated cycle. \n\nI'm not sure what she would say knowing I've mostly focused on modern fertility treatments. I'm not totally against natural remedies though. I drink my raspberry tea, coq10, b supplement, etc. I already sprout, I love fresh sprouts they're delicious and yummy on sandwiches. But that's about where my level is at. Have any of you tried what my mother is suggesting? More importantly, how on earth do I convey to her that my infertility is so much more complicated than she can imagine, and incredibly painful. Physically, mentally, and emotionally. What can I say that's respectful-ish, but also shuts down this stuff?
