We were quickly diagnosed as unexplained, with \\*possible/borderline\\* DOR. My stats weren\u2019t great, but also not awful (AFC = 8, AMH = 0.95, FSH = 12), and my then-RE offered the untestable hypothesis that my autoimmune diseases (ulcerative colitis and asymptomatic Hashimoto\u2019s disease) had damaged my eggs. At the time our case was considered pretty straightforward, and we were offered IUI - but we ultimately decided to proceed with IVF for the purposes of embryo banking (ha!). (The (Fertilome genetic test)\\[ [https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8vo4k8/fertilome\\_results\\_pof\\_rpl/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8vo4k8/fertilome_results_pof_rpl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\\] later found that I have a moderately increased risk for Primary Ovarian Insufficiency, but we didn\u2019t know that at the time \u2013 and so far I\u2019m still ovulating.)\n\nThroughout this process, we were very lucky to have some insurance coverage \u2013 insurance would cover up to 4 retrievals, but we would pay for all meds and transfers out of pocket. We had heard the advice that \u201cIVF is often diagnostic,\u201d so all along, our strategy has been to be as scientific as possible, in order to get as much information as we could out of the 4 chances that we were allotted.\n\n\\*\\*Cycle 1, April 2018\n\nICSI, EPP antagonist protocol\\*\\*\n\n* \\*\\*AFC = \\*\\* 8\n* \\*\\*Protocol:\\*\\* We started with 375/225 Gonal-F/Menopur, and then switched to 300/300 on day 6 due to slow follicle growth.

Furthermore, she said that when embryos degrade in quality between days 3 and 5, this is often indicative of a sperm problem.

That one was frozen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\*\\*What we learned:\\*\\* \\*This cycle confirmed that IVF was better than ICSI, but that there was still an underlying problem that wasn\u2019t fixed by switching to 100% standard IVF. With the dramatic drop-off coming between days 3 and 6, we still didn\u2019t have a consensus on whether the problem was caused by poor egg quality, poor sperm quality, or both. Our RE was pressuring us to either (a) transfer the poor quality blast, (b) keep doing retrievals with the same protocol, because \u201cyour retrieval numbers are the only thing you have going for you \u2013 and with enough eggs, there has to be a normal blast in there!\u201d or (c) take a huge financial gamble on donor eggs, because that was \u201cprobably\u201d our problem.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, my husband and I felt that it didn\u2019t make any financial sense to continue. So far, 36 eggs had gotten us exactly 1 \u201cnormal\u201d blast with poor morphology, which the embryologist thought wouldn\u2019t survive the freeze/thaw. It would cost us $8k in meds for a 4thretrieval (not to mention the emotional and physical toll), and then we would be totally out of pocket for any additional retrievals, donor purchases, or transfers. But then we learned that my husband\u2019s company was improving its insurance offerings for 2019: if we proceeded with a 4thand final retrieval, insurance would cover the cost of meds. \n\nWe decided to switch REs, and made an appointment with the clinic director, who is known for taking on difficult cases and thinking outside the box. We were very blunt with him about where we were at financially and emotionally, and told him that we were willing to do one more retrieval if it could provide us with definitive answers about whether there was any hope for us with ART, or whether we should instead pursue adoption. He suggested \u201cThe Nuclear Option.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Cycle 4, March 2019: The Nuclear Option\n\nMicrodose Lupron + HGH\n\n3-way split with my eggs, husband\u2019s sperm, donor eggs, and donor sperm\\*\\*\n\n* **AFC =** 14\n* **Protocol:** standard Microdose Lupron protocol + HGH; HCG trigger on day 10 (the goal was to stim me faster than my prior cycles; RE\u2019s theory was that long stims were frying my eggs)\n* **Results:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Cycle|Gametes|Fert.

The one day-6 blast was PGS normal and grade C. All of the blasts created with my eggs were day-6 and grade C. One of \"ours\" came back normal, and one mosaic. The donor sperm blast also came back normal. \n\n* \\*\\*What we learned:\\*\\* \\*As my RE summed it up, the differences between my eggs and the donor eggs were \u201cprofound,\u201d proving once and for all that I have shitty egg quality. Although this was the initial hypothesis, seeing the results in black and white gave me, my husband, and our RE a sense of closure: we know that it\u2019s definitely not worth it to keep doing retrievals. In addition, seeing that my husband\u2019s sperm actually fared \\*better\\* than the donor sperm put many of our fears to rest, and reassured us that it would \\*not\\* be a waste of money to purchase additional donor eggs. Finally, as we prepare to transfer our poor quality embryos, we have the reassurance that if they fail to thaw, we have some healthy egg donor embryos waiting in the wings. There\u2019s a good chance that I won\u2019t have a completely canceled transfer; just a different embryo than I was hoping for. And no matter what happens, at this point we feel that we\u2019ve truly tried everything, which brings its own sense of peace.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12376, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Split Cycles: On Being a Human Science Experiment", "updated_utc": 1555278083, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bcvmip/split_cycles_on_being_a_human_science_experiment/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "HorrorJelly55", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3et445do", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1555200203, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bcx0im/high_fsh_went_to_doctor_and_got_some_answers/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "bcx0im", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "8ba82e74-18df-11e9-8426-0efccfe053d4", "link_flair_text": "Research &amp; Science", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/bcx0im/high_fsh_went_to_doctor_and_got_some_answers/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1555200205, "score": 0, "selftext": "Hi all. I'm currently 26, and after some routine bloodwork, I found out that I have an FSH of 9. I know that's not extremely high, but it's high for my age. I'm in a long term relationship and not married, with no intention of having kids for a few years. I was concerned that I would need to start looking into freezing eggs. \n\nI went to a RE (well known). I got ultrasounds and blood work. I mentioned that my grandmother, her sisters, my mom and her sisters all had bad endometriosis (all except one great aunt diagnosed via surgery). I also explained to him how I get severe period cramping when it's not my period, back pain, very irregular periods since I started etc. And he wrote that all down, looked at my blood work, and then proceeded to PubMed and printed me about 5 (out of many) articles about endometriosis correlating to a higher FSH. I was skeptical bc I read on a lot of websites that people said their FSH didn't go down after surgery to remove the endo, but these studies were done from different hospitals and labs from around the world. I know that endo has a risk of infertility down the line, but I guess I was prepared for a diagnoses of DOR.\n\nI'm not trying to \"boast\" but wanted any ladies that are in the situation I'm in and have suspected endo to bring it up to their docs.

At 5\u20198\u201d and 155lbs, I\u2019m not really overweight like many PCOS women but have some very stubborn belly fat that nothing seems to budge. \n\nHusband: Male, 32. Very healthy overall, but possible low morphology. \n\nHistory: We started \u201cnot trying/not preventing\u201d in May 2016, and then earnestly trying by the end of 2016. My cycles were irregular and long - 40-65 days. I had a doctors appt with my PCP and one with my OB/GYN, both said I should be fine for pregnancy. I was doing all the usual things to be healthy - taking prenatals, eating well, exercise, lower stress, etc. \n\n\n\nBy September 2017 I had moved and got a new OB/GYN. She said, \u201cyou\u2019ve only really been trying since last December, so it\u2019s not been a full year yet so your not officially dealing with infertility. Just keep trying!\u201d Got nothing out of that appt. I went full steam ahead with vitamins, dietary tricks and natural supplements. Anything to get me to ovulate.\n\nBy next Spring, I had read Taking Charge of Your Fertility 3 times, I was temping, tracking, charting, etc. Temping was a failure, too all over the place results. I was using OPKs and never got a positive. Elevated LH was giving me the same results every day.\n\nIn June, I decided to work with a naturopath who specialized in women\u2019s care, hormones, PCOS, etc. She offered to run a bunch of tests but they\u2019d be out of pocket and she wasn\u2019t convinced they were necessary anyways because she was quite sure I had PCOS and didn\u2019t need more than that. After three appointments, she tried to get me to replace all my prenatals and supplements with her \u201chigher quality\u201d brand and I realized I was dealing with a salesmen and stopped working with her. \n\nThe only advice I took from her was to use a 20mg dose of natural progesterone cream on cycle days 14-28. This actually appeared to be regulating my cycle and gave me cycles ranging from 28-32 days for the first time in years. \n\nBy December 2018, I once again moved and this time I went straight to a fertility clinic. It is highly rated with solid success rates.\n\nFirst thing the RE said was to stop using the progesterone cream and stop wasting my energy temping and using OPKs. She said for many women with PCOS these are useless, and I agree based on my experience.\n\nShe then ran a transvaginal ultrasound, 2 hormone panels and an HSG. \n\nShe confirmed I do have PCOS. She ruled out Thyroid or anything else. They found uterine fibroids, benign and not considered to be affecting fertility at this time.\n\nHusband got a SA. \nHis came back with healthy volume, healthy motility and very high concentration. But his morphology was at 1%. \n\nAfter all that, we had a meeting with her where she purposed a treatment plan of either Letrozole with IUI first, or more likely, straight to ICSI-IVF. I must admit we were surprised, we were expecting more treatment options prior to that stage. Things like medication to encourage me ovulating and further investigation of why Husband\u2019s morphology might be low. We are considering getting him a second test just to confirm those results weren\u2019t a fluke. To pursue IVF right out of the gate based on one test seemed surprising. \n\nThe did say they support if people want to try acupuncture in addition to their treatment and recommended a practitioner who they work with, we will consider that.\n\nI am still new to the world of advanced fertility treatment. Still learning what this stuff means, the process, the risks and success rates. In the mean time, I have the option of getting a new job which would provide insurance which would probably cover this stuff (Starbucks, as Im already a barista for a Starbucks kiosk anyways). Even if I switched tomorrow though, insurance wouldn\u2019t kick in for 4 months so we will be using that time to be as healthy as possible with a focus on supporting egg and sperm quality and also to research our options and carefully consider this route.\n\nAny and all advice is greatly appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12388, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Infertility for 3yrs now, but still have options.

But how do you tell your partner that you no longer want to pursue fertility treatment on account of the time and financial investment?  \n\n\nFor a long time I had been lukewarm on having children but later wanted children.  Because of this, and out of love for my spouse, who is very ready to be a mother, we tried to have baby for 4 years. Then, we went through two rounds of IVF. Now, without insurance, we are considering a \"shared risk\" program, which would cost $20,000 USD if successful, plus medication as well as travel and accommodations in the US  (we live in Canada - I don't know of shared risk programs near us in Canada).  \n\n\nAt this point, I am of the view that we should allocate our hard-earned money to our lives -- travel, donating, friends, and so on. My spouse and I often squabble over financial goals, particularly when IVF comes up, because IVF will require years of savings, which means no house, no travel (without feeling guilty), and no \"spoiling\" ourselves (again, without feeling guilty about not using the money toward IVF). I'm willing to spend another $10,000 or so but that's about it.

This is in the hopes that giving it up might help me actually have success.\n\nI feel like now every time I turn down drinks I have to convince the person trying to make me drink that I am not, in fact, pregnant. And given that this has been a soul-crushing effort in futility that I think about nearly constantly and has put me in a state of mild depression, having to convince coworkers and friends that I\u2019m not avoiding alcohol because I\u2019m with child is maddening. Like, I actually want to shout at them to mind their own fucking business. And, like, I\u2019d fucking know if I was fucking pregnant. Where do people get off asking someone that? Literally, this has now happened to me four times in the last two weeks.\n\nIt happened again this week. There was a reception with a bunch of free booze at work and a colleague was like \u201cstick around and have a drink\u201d. I said no thanks and then BOTH my manager and my colleague started pelting me with questions about me being pregnant. And the thing is they WOULD NOT stop. I said no, and they were like \u201care you sure? You can tell us.\u201d To which I said \u201cI am definitely 100% not pregnant.\u201d But then my colleague kept going on and on about how cool it would be to have a baby on the team. Yeah, it would be fucking cool, wouldn\u2019t it?! Why don\u2019t you go get pregnant then - or on second thought don\u2019t because then I\u2019ll have to work with your pregnant ass and secretly hate you for eternity.\n\nBut can I just say I feel like this is part of a larger peer pressure experience I\u2019ve been having with colleagues and friends who don\u2019t like that I\u2019m not drinking, going out, and eating crappy food. It\u2019s made me really reevaluate whether people in my life want me to be healthy. The silver lining of this whole infertility thing is I\u2019m now healthier than I\u2019ve ever been. Sure I\u2019ve lost only 10lbs, but I\u2019m more toned and strong after my year of consistent exercise. I\u2019ve given up dairy, alcohol, caffeine, sugar, and have gone BPA free. I\u2019m taking every supplement under the sun and my energy and health has improved. I haven\u2019t had a cold or flu now in over a year. Also this week, in addition to being pelted with questions about whether I am pregnant, my colleagues were \u201cthin-shaming\u201d me for eating healthy and turning down treats and snacks. Like, they\u2019d mock me for having a salad. And I\u2019m not even what you\u2019d call \u201cskinny\u201d I just look a lot more \u201cfit\u201d these days. \n\nAnyway, it\u2019s clear misery loves company and I\u2019m tired of people trying to pry into my personal life or mock choices I\u2019ve made in an earnest, nearly 2 year long attempt to have a fucking baby. And being asked if I\u2019m pregnant repeatedly when I am MOST DEFINITELY NOT is just adding insult to injury. There\u2019s nothing like having to argue with people that you\u2019re not pregnant when saying those very words \u201cno, I\u2019m not pregnant\u201d are insanely traumatizing and just another reminder that despite all I have done, I\u2019m not there yet. Thanks, friends and colleagues, for forcing me to say that sentence out loud repeatedly, on my birthday two weeks ago no less when I turned down a birthday shot. Yeah, not only are my eggs now in an apparent quality free fall but I have to convince you I\u2019m not pregnant? \n\nSeriously... what is wrong with people?

Nothing happened. So I went to my gynecologist. Thankfully he wanted to help and didn't push the whole \"try for a year first since you're young.\" \n\nHe sent for an ultrasound, which came back normal. Then we did an HSG. The doctor that performed it said it looked okay. One potentially blocked tube but the other was okay. \nMy doctor had other ideas, to him they both looked blocked. So we scheduled an exploratory laparoscopy in the beginning of November. A 2 hour surgery turned into 4. They found Stage 4 endometriosis everywhere and a 7 cm teratoma. Both my tubes were done for, we had discussed the potential removal of both and I had given him permission to use his judgment while performing the laparoscopy. So he removed them both.\n\nEven though I knew it was a possibility, I still felt like a failure. How could I not notice Stage 4 endometriosis?? Or a 7cm teratoma?? Who misses that?? But the truth is I had no symptoms. My periods were always normal and always on time. Looking back, I had a bit of urine incontinence that I blamed on gaining weight but might have endo affecting my bladder.\n\nI had a really hard time coming to terms that I am infertile and I will never have the \"accidental\" pregnancy every other couple around me seems to be having.\n\nWe are in a rural area and the only IVF clinic is packed. Right now, it seems we won't be able to start our first cycle until mid June. I'm excited and scared and hate the waiting but it does give me time to stop eating my feelings!\n\nIt's been a crazy 18 months and I have no one IRL that understands. The most people can say is \"It'll happen!\" \"Be positive!\" I even had a counselor suggest that I should just adopt and skip IVF! (She's no longer my counselor.) The truth is that I might not happen. The teratoma was near my right ovary so it could have easily affected my eggs. My husband might also have issues. We just did testing 2 days ago so we're still waiting on results. \n\nI am remaining cautiously optimistic about the rest of this journey!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12396, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "No tubes!

I see a lot of ladies commenting on the studies of ovarian injections, but I'm looking for uterine experiences and info.  I had a myomectomy to remove fibroids (so I could carry a successful pregnancy, which I bet I would have done without the surgery that caused all this), which then caused Asherman's (because the powers that be hate me, a lot), and after seeing Dr Isaacson in Boston have been told that I have basically no normal endo tissue on the top of my uterus... the most important spot.  I have pictures from the procedure that do show that I have normal tissue in there, I just don't know where, but I'm guessing that's why they still put me on estrogen/progesterone.  I'm doing that mostly out of curiosity to see what the lining I DO have does.  \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) How do I find a clinic that does these injections?  I'd like to talk to a doctor that does it and see if it's possibly worth pursuing.\n\n2) If my lining doesn't grow at the top, but it does grow fine maybe mid or lower, I know placenta previa (I think) is a thing, but has anyone been in a similar situation and been able to carry successfully?

It\u2019s a super rare, aggressive form of endometrial cancer, and we have no idea how long she has at this stage, but it is terminal.\n\nIt\u2019s just... one more thing in what has been maybe the worst year of my life. \n\nIn some ways, my decision to escalate our fertility treatment was in response to my mother\u2019s cancer. We had been trying, but not taking it too seriously until I realized my mother may not be around, and that if I was going to have a baby I\u2019d want my child to know her... \n\nShe is such an amazing woman and such a wonderful grandparent to my step siblings\u2019 children.

No seriously, I just... don\u2019t know what to do anymore. And maybe it was wrong to place such importance on something I have no control over.

I just want to say thank you to all of you here. You\u2019ve been a great source of support.

The only answers we have is 2% morphology on my husband\u2019s first SA 2 years ago, low vitamin D levels for me (which I\u2019m on a daily supplement for, if I remember to take it), and further testing past our 3rd IUI revealed elevated NK cells for me and high DNA fragmentation for my husband. The 2nd RE we consulted with doesn\u2019t take the last 2 results into account due to insufficient medical evidence, which my husband is kinda on board with. \n\nThis journey really sucks and I\u2019m just so jaded with everyone else around being able to get pregnant and I can\u2019t.

First off, apologies if this post comes across as insensitive to those who have been diagnosed as infertile and have been trying to conceive for a lot longer than my partner and I. This post is in no way meant to upset/offend anyone or make a mountain out of a mole hill, but rather to receive advice/support from those who have experienced this as well.\n\nA little bit about my partner and I/our intimate history:\n\n1. Neither of us have had an STD. \n2. We have had unprotected intercourse for approximately a year and a half.\n3. My partner does not pull out.\n4. I have a pretty regular menstruation cycle. \n5. I believe I\u2019ve had 3-4 *possible* miscarriages (Spotting, late menstruation, large dark red mass approx. the size of a quarter, then began menstruation as I normally would.) \n6. My mother had a history of miscarriages, but successfully had 4 children, including myself.\n7. My partner has a twin brother, who successfully conceived a child last year (unsure if this takes his possible sterility off the table)\n8. I have a moderately low libido, especially in comparison to women my age.\n9. We engage in intercourse an average of 2-4 times/week, some weeks more, some weeks less.\n10. I\u2019m 5\u20192, ~103 lbs. (Unsure if my size could be a factor.)\n\nMy question is, for lack of better words, what the heck is going on? Is it possible to be infertile at such an early age? Should my next step be seeing a medical professional and possibly getting tested for infertility?\n\nDisclaimer: We are both fully aware of how young we are, how life-changing it is to conceive a child, and the financial/emotional commitment that comes with bringing a life into this world.

Her novel, [The End of Miracles](https://monicastarkmanauthor.com), was written to help educate the public about these issues. It is about a woman whose deep need to bear a child is sabotaged by infertility and a tragic late miscarriage.* \n\n**Tuesday, April 23rd, Dr. Jason Yeh (/u/jasonyehmd) will be teaming up with Dr. Kenan Omurtag (/u/kro83a) for an AMA at 1:00pm PDT (4:00pm EDT)** \n\n*Both physicians are board certified obstetrician gynecologists and reproductive endocrinologists who take care of all things related to pregnancy, infertility, and reproductive hormone issues. Our typical day consists of minor/major surgery cases, diagnostic testing, and procedures such as intrauterine insemination all the way to in vitro fertilization egg retrievals and embryo transfers. Our practice focus includes polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), unexplained infertility, male infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, third party reproduction (egg donation, sperm donation, gestational surrogacy), basic infertility treatments (ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination), and advanced fertility treatments (In vitro fertilization, preimplantation genetic testing/diagnosis, comprehensive chromosome screening).*\n\n**Wednesday, April 24th, /u/NH_Surrogacy will be doing an AMA at 9:00am PDT (12:00pm EDT)** \n\n*NH_Surrogacy is a New Hampshire &amp; Massachusetts licensed attorney who practices surrogacy and fertility law.

Primarily our job focuses on the day that sperm and eggs come together and extends to when the embryo is transferred back. Between that time so many parts are moving and patients rarely get an in depth explanation about this. What started out as an fun hobby on Instagram has now led to 1000\u2019s of patients getting the chance to speak 1 on 1 with the real baby-makers in an unbiased, informative format. Now is your chance to Ask us Anything :)*\n\n**Thursday, April 25th, /u/orchidelerium will be doing an AMA starting at 3:00pm PDT (6:00pm EDT)**\n\n*orchidelerium is a genetic counselor at a large academic fertility center on the East Coast of the US.

I am a positive and upbeat person, and I try to confer that as a form of reassurance to my patients. I will be joined by my husband, /u/RE_hubby, who has far more reddit experience (and he is an Emergency Room Physician).*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12455, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "/r/infertility\u2019s 2019 National Infertility Awareness Week (NIAW) Ask Me Anything (AMA) Event Schedule", "updated_utc": 1555659439, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/becpyl/rinfertilitys_2019_national_infertility_awareness/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "smellygymbag", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "42F/PCOS/10+IUI,8ER,1MC", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2crjxyo9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1555546507, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bef1sp/glassdoor_article_10_companies_w_maternity_and/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "bef1sp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/bef1sp/glassdoor_article_10_companies_w_maternity_and/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1555546508, "score": 6, "selftext": "https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/companies-offer-fertility-benefits/\n\nI just found it.

My second IVF cycle has been one from hell. I hope the stand alone post is ok.\n\n\nBackground is that my husband and I are pursuing IVF because I am at risk for Huntington's Disease. I stupidly thought this process wouldn't suck all the happiness from my life and thought IVF would be \"easy\". JK LOL I was so fucking wrong. First cycle was 33 eggs retrieved, 29 mature, 25 fertilized, 12 frozen embryos, only 1 PGS/PGD normal. We opted to do another cycle to bank additional embryos.\n\n\nMy first cycle my estrogen levels were over 9600 so I triggered with Lupron only. This time my around my estrogen was over 9700 and they had me dual trigger with Lupron and HCG. I questioned why they changed it and the nurse told me that's just what the doctor wanted. 44 eggs retrieved, 38 mature, 29 fertilized. So I'm thinking things should be good. Last cycle we we had 25 fertilized and ended up with 12 frozen embryos for PGD/PGS. But of course as soon as I start to feel a glimmer of hope there's something just waiting to crush me.\n\n\nThis cycle I end up in the ER in pain for OHSS, gained 10 pounds in a few days, look 4 months pregnant, and need IV fluid because my bloodwork is all over the place. My abdomen and lungs have fluid in them. OHSS sucks! Don't be stupid like me and think you're ok for a few days before admit to yourself you can't breath properly or get out of bed without severe pain.\n\n\nFast forward to today. My clinic makes you wait 8 days for your final embryo biopsy count. I should have received a call yesterday but by 3pm I heard nothing. I call my nurse line at 3:20 and they tell me they'll send the lab a message. I never received a day 8 call. This morning I call the nurse line again and say I need answers ASAP. The lab calls me and tells me only 5 embryos made it!! WTF???? 5/29 biopsied when the first time around I had 12/25?? The lab doesn't have any answers other than this stuff happens sometimes. I've requested to speak with my physician because this doesn't make sense. \n\n\nI want know:\n1. Did the dual trigger fuck this up?\n2. Did the lab fuck this up?\n3. Or is there a fertility issue that's being ignored here because we're young, healthy, and pursuing IVF for PGD purposes?\n\n\nIt's so hard to talk to the doctor or lab at my clinic. I can only call a nurse line or coordinator and hope they convey my message across. I am so mad and so sad at the same time. I don't know if I should scream or cry or both. This is the worst fucking thing I've ever chosen to put myself through. Oh and I'm broke now because we're self pay.\n\n\n\nTLDR: IVF 2 gave me OHSS and only 5 embryos out of 44 eggs retrieved. IVF 1 had 33 eggs retrieved and 12 frozen embryos (only 1 PGD/PGS normal).

I just need to vent and cry.. I feel like I can't to my friends because they don't understand, I don't want to burden them and frankly I am tired of hearing their stories of friends of friends who have gotten pregnant by just not thinking about it. \n\nI was recently diagnosed with hypothalamic amenorrhea, I haven't gotten a regular period since I went off birth control 8 months ago. I wish it had been a different diagnosis as terrible as that sounds. My doctor explained that my brain isn't connecting to my lady parts to tell them to ovulate. As he explained to us in our last appointment this generally happens to women with eating disorders that causes their LH levels to be so low but can be reversed by treatment and eating.. well I didn't come out and say it but I over exercise and diet all the time. I don't know what it's like to not be on a diet. I had been fasting on and off for the past year, that causes low LH levels. Now I am trying to convince myself it's ok to eat at 8 in the morning and not just live off coffee till the afternoon. Also over exercising causes low LH levels, another thing I am guilty of. Yes, I know this is not a healthy mind set. To the doctor I don't appear under weight or over weight, just normal.. So he hasn't linked them together, or who knows maybe he did hence why I had a lecture on it and didn't want to say anything in front of my husband. So I guess I do have a reason/diagnosis but it's just hard to admit it to myself let alone anyone else that I struggle with this so hard. Of course I have had friends comment about it and I just tell them that's not the cause :/ but now I know that it most likely is. I completed my goal last week of running a half marathon, so that will be my last long run for quite some time. As for working out I am cutting back the high intensity programs as well. I don't know about anyone else but working out has been my \"me\" time and a huge stress reliever. I guess I should also mention here I also have anxiety and depression, so in addition to therapy and meds, exercise has been a coping mechanism. Also I am thinking to myself people have way bigger problems with infertility than I do because this is something stupid I have done to myself, it's not something that nature caused. \n\nThe good news is that the doctor says I have plenty of eggs and healthy ovaries, so that was a win. I had extremely low estrogen levels though, most likely a result from over exercising. \n\nThe only time I have gotten a period in the 8 months of trying is when I went on birth control for a month and then it forced it to come. Progesterone did not help when we tried that. I've also now been on 3 cycles of clomid/letrozole and now we are on to Menuprol shots because that is what is going to kick up my LH levels. I'm thankful that after being on the phone with the doctor's office, pharmacy and insurance company for hours the past few weeks insurance that I have been let into the infertility program. Again though, this was another tough pill to swallow that I'm currently infertile. If I hadn't been let into the program then we wouldn't be going through with infertility treatment and paying everything out of pocket. Or the best part was if I hadn't have already been through 3 cycles of meds then the insurance company was going to make me take Gonal F for at least 2-3 cycles, which wouldn't have boosted my LH levels supposedly as much as Menuprol.\n\nSo I don't know how many cycles of the Menuprol they expect me to do yet. I've cried the past 3 nights injecting myself just knowing that I'll be doing this at least for the next week. I feel like I have a new thing on my plate every week and I am trying so hard to keep up with everything and trying not to break down every day. Husband goes off to deposit his specimen on Friday, so I know they are going to do a semen analysis but I think the plan next is an IUI? Is that what happens after you have injections? I have no elfin clue anymore because they were also talking about clearing my tubes out next time. \n\nSo all in all I am confused, upset and overwhelmed. I have an amazing husband who loves and supports me but frankly I do not think he understands how hard this is on me. I know he is trying to be strong for the both of us and say the right things but he is another person who has given me the \"well so and so stopped doing the infertility treatments, stopped  worrying and then got pregnant speech\". Like hey I am not getting my fucking period over here, I bet you their hormones were actually behaving. Only 2 of my friends know that I am getting the injections and I don't want to explain it to anyone else. We're supposed to go to dinner with friends this weekend and I don't want them asking about it but I know if I don't get a drink at dinner they are going to be questioning why. Anyone else getting injections not drinking? My doctor didn't say not to drink I've just read that people don't drink while they are going through this.\n\nAny advice or support would be welcomed.

I call bull.... The pain put me in a trance like state and all I could do was deep breathing to not cry. The radiologist also asked me to move at one point so he could get a better angle and I flatly said 'No'. To make the experience even more fabulous, I had the procedure done on my 30th birthday.
