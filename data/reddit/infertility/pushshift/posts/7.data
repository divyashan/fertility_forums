Yelling, lots of yelling. Which is very rare for us. I had my HSG yesterday and it was bad. Fully blocked right tube, mostly blocked left. So that sucks and also explains a lot. I cried when we found out and he did too, and he handled it well afterward, and was really trying to be positive and optimistic about a likely IVF. \n\nBut then I had to go out and get an antibiotic, which took a couple hours because of a mix up and while I was gone he called his mom about an unrelated health issue of his own, and of course she asked about the HSG, so he got upset because he's feeling inadequate because he can't just whip out his checkbook and plunk down the 15K for IVF, and he told her all about my blocked tubes.  Now, I had assumed we would share the results with her at some point soon, as we've been pretty open with her about the process so far.  But damn. I wasn't even home yet, I was still running around chasing down the antibiotic, all cramps and fucking devastated that my tubes are pretty much out for the count.  I had not had a moment to sit down and process the news. So I wasn't ready to share it with anyone yet.\n\nSo that said, I totally get how it happened.  I know he wasn't trying to be hurtful or disrespectful of my feelings.  So when he told me, I was upset that he shared the news, that it was no longer just known only by the two of us, but I wasn't mad at him.  I was disappointed and, illogically or not, embarrassed, but not mad.  When I said, \"Your mom knows?\", he said something like, \"Sorry but she asked...\" and a further explanation of their conversation.  I said - calmly - something like, \"I understand, but I wish you wouldn't have done that.\" And then he just got super defensive, like how could I not immediately just be completely fine that she knows already, and we ended up ending the conversation as I was still waiting for my antibiotic. (Finally got to sit down around 9pm after my 1pm HSG, ugh!)\n\nSo I hadn't thought that much more about it as I'm pretty preoccupied with my shitty tubes, but he brought it back up today and I stayed calm for a good while but I finally lost my temper when it became clear that nothing I said was going to be acceptable except that it was fine that he told her and I had no problem with his timing.  Which would be untrue.  I wish he had waited. I do. I know he needed to talk and share his feelings with someone, and I get that, but yeah, I wish that in this case he had put me ahead of himself and at least asked me before calling, because of course she was going to ask about the HSG.  \n\nBut he didn't, and I know he wasn't hurting me intentionally, and I know he loves me, and it's over and can't be undone.  I just wish he would validate my feelings as I feel I've validated his instead of telling me I resent his relationship with his mother and that I'm holding him to a double standard. I love his mom and I totally get the need to talk about this stuff.  I just wish he had waited to call her and that he understood why I feel that way.\n\nThanks for listening.  I don't have anyone that I feel like I can share this kind of thing with, and it helps to write it down, even if I'm missing a bunch of details because I'm typing this on my kindle. I know it's probably still really long though, so sorry for that. I left and am typing this while I wait for my yoga class in a couple hours. I sort of feel like I should go home and try to work it out, but then again a little space might be good, and also yoga will probably help me deal with it all without blowing up again.  Argh.

I'm 28 and I have secondary infertility. We've been TTC for 2 years now. I have PCOS (but my fertility doc is calling this unexplained infertility because my hormones look good so she doesn't think the issue is really the PCOS), insulin resistance, hypothyroid (treated) and MTHFR A1298C homozygous. My husband has some slight issues (I think his morphology was a little off, but nothing major and he's taking Clomid for low testosterone, which is working).\n\n\nSo the plan for this cycle was to try Femara 5mg days 3-7 and then IUI. However, they couldn't see a mature follicle on ultrasound (my ovaries like to hide so the doc thinks they just couldn't see it), so we didn't do an IUI this cycle despite my LH (9) and E2 (118) being elevated. I had a progesterone level drawn and it indicated ovulation (it was 15, doctor thinks I ovulated around day 15 or 16). Hubby and I did have sex once that week (we were counting on the IUI, so we didn't put much effort into sex) on cycle day 14. \n\n\nI took a few HPT tests. Thought I saw a super light line on one of them (I think that was 12 dpo, but not sure) but a digital test the next day was negative, and the other HPTs were negative. Saw the doctor yesterday to talk about my next cycle and had an HCG and progesterone level drawn. Got the results this afternoon. HCG was 2.7 and progesterone was .85. The nurse said they consider over 2 positive for the HCG, but most places say over 5 is positive. Today was cycle day 31. My cycles the last few months have been short (they were around 30-45 days several months ago), like 24-26 days. The nurse said unless my period started, I needed to come back in on Monday to check the HCG level again to see if this was a \"false positive\". About 2 hours after talking to her, my period started. So now I'm wondering if this is a chemical pregnancy. I didn't think to ask her while on the phone. I will ask tomorrow but thought I would post here in the meantime.\n\nSorry for writing a book, I kind of needed to vent since my husband doesn't seem to understand.

So fast forward a few years and we're now looking at unknown infertility after repeated chemical pregnancies with IVF. \n\nWell today we finally know we did something right. Before doing another transfer our re requested we redo our prep work of labs since it's been awhile. That was a set back for us because it's just money and more delay in our opinion. I guess that's why she makes the big bucks cause she made the right call. On my wife's SIS (I think that's the acroynm) they thought they found adhesions and said we needed a hysterescopy. So another delay of course but we did it and guess what the surgeon found...nothing! She said all she saw was a good thick lining but she cut it off to be sure. Uhh what?!? No adhesions? So we had mixed emotions on that of course. Wellllll we just got an email that after they tested the tissue they found polyps! That's the best gross news ever. It may be small news but we will take any win.

He has had three tests come back with 0 sperm.  Recently I had my first check in with an RE to see if we will face any issues on my end if IVF or IUI is in our future.  Initial results are good, but I'll know more after my blood test results. Anyway, yesterday I confessed how upsetting it is to hear about another woman at work (younger than me) that's pregnant. My husband has been very supportive and upset about this whole situation himself too, but yesterday he really surprised me with his response. He said something like, \"I don't know why you're so upset. As far as we know, you can have children, just not mine\". What? I didn't really know what to say. I moved on to say I'm not sure how far I want to go with all the medical procedures if the child won't be  biologically ours together. Frankly I think everyone has a right to do what's best for them, and I don't know if we will go through it all.  It's all too soon to tell. Either way, I was just so surprised by this. Of course I want HIS baby.  That's sort of the point of us trying in the first place. If we want a child enough, I fully believe I could love and care for an adopted or child conceived from donor sperm, but I haven't fully mourned the loss of our biological child.

Half a pill twice a day from this day to that day, then a whole pill three times a day until day whatever, then two pills three times a day until whenever. \n\nYou can have two reminders in case you ignore or miss the first one (or forget to mark your dose as taken). You can mark your dose as taken early so it won't ring, and you can manually enter when you took a dose if you didn't have your phone handy to mark it when you did. \n\nYou can \"archive\" drugs so that they stop reminding you but you don't have to reenter them another time. \n\nThe free features are enough to get by for all the protocols I've been on. Sure, I can't select \"injection\" and everything has to be in pills, but there's a notes section for each drug where you could clarify that if necessary (but really, if it says \"progesterone in oil\" I know 50 pills really means 50mg). \n\nMy friend who broke her ankle found this really useful too, so it might be worth passing along. \n\nNormally I would buy the full version just to say thank you for the awesome free version, except that this works on a really pricey subscription service. I will probably sign up once then cancel to throw them some love. \n\nDo keep in mind that the reminders don't have the power to override Do Not Disturb in iOS. \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "App recommendation for managing medications", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/37s7le/app_recommendation_for_managing_medications/"}, {"author": "cutedazy", "author_created_utc": 1432857091, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Mama - TTC", "author_fullname": "t2_nrwf0", "created_utc": 1432946191, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/37sf29/royal_jelly_and_fertility/", "gilded": 0, "id": "37sf29", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 24, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/37sf29/royal_jelly_and_fertility/", "retrieved_on": 1440705176, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So, my parents are experimenting with beekeeping.

The hubs and I decided that it was time for a break from fertility and upon this decision we IMMEDIATELY felt a weight lifted. \n\nThe thought of enjoying our summer, not scheduling our lives around appts or meds, or symptoms, or emotional outbursts\u2026.ah\u2026 doesn\u2019t that sound amazing? We think so!\n\nI let it all go. Really\u2026 in a matter of a few days I had let it go and started to feel AMAZING. I know we\u2019ll get back to it in September, but for now, let\u2019s enjoy each other, go on vacation (we booked a trip to Japan!) and just chillax. We NEED this time to decompress and prepare for the continued fertility journey ahead, and so we\u2019re taking it.\n\nSo this week, I was supposed to get my period last Saturday. My period is very regular, always starting at around 28-30 days. In the past I\u2019ve had it start at 31 days, and a couple years ago there was once a stretch when I was *certain* I was preggers because I stretched to 33 days before starting. 33 days is now my benchmark for extended start, though I've only experienced this once.\n\nThis week, day 31 came and went. I didn\u2019t notice. 32 and 33 and I started wearing my pad. 34 and I wore a pad and carried a tampon in my pocket. Any time now!\n\n35, nothing. 36, nothing. 37, nothing. At this point I start to hope. I mean\u2026 wouldn\u2019t you? I tell my husband I\u2019m NOT going to take a test because I \u201cwon\u2019t be deceived again.\u201d I also tell him about the ongoing joke amongst fertility ladies, \u201cif you ever want your period to start on command, just take a pregnancy test.\u201d \n\nBut as day 37 continues on, I REALLY start to convince myself. \n\nThis. Is. It. \n\nI\u2019m pregnant! We\u2019re one of those miracle couples who try and try and try, and one day when they give up, it magically happens for them! Oh my God, that\u2019s US now! What about the 5k I\u2019m running in June? Who cares! What about our Japan trip in July? Fuck all the plans! Fuck them all, because I\u2019M PREGNANT and I didn\u2019t even plan to be! \n\nBut\u2026 I remind myself to stay a little cautious I\u2019ve been burnt before (and soooo many times). But then again\u2026I think to myself \u201c37 days? That would just be a cruel fucking joke.\u201d\n\nToday is day 38. I get up in the morning and wipe before peeing. Still nothing! Woo hoo! \n\nI take a pregnancy test, set the test in the sink, finish peeing. \n\nI wipe. Spotting. \n\nI wipe again. Heavier spotting. I\u2019m definitely getting my period. \n\nAFTERIPEEONTHESTICKAREYOUFUCKKINGKIDDINGME!!!!!!\n\nAlso, the test was negative.\n\nI\u2019m not any more disappointed about \u201cnot being pregnant\u201d than I have been in the past. What I\u2019m REALLY (no\u2026 REALLY REALLY) angry about is that I allowed myself to be TRICKED. AGAIN. My body has just played this cruel joke on me, when I decided last month I was not going to think about fertility stuff all summer. Is it too much to ask to get your period on day 34 or 35 WHEN YOU EXPECT IT? I mean, come on! \n\nI feel so stupid and deceived. What\u2019s worse is that (against my better judgment) I got my husband involved and I know he was getting excited, too. I think that\u2019s the worst part\u2026 that my excitement started to convince him it was really happening.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019m \"letting all go\" again. And I\u2019m not looking back until September. I\u2019m starting yoga on Tuesday, I\u2019m running my 5k in June, and we\u2019re going to Japan in July.\n\nAnd no matter how many times my body calls, asking me to give it one more chance, \u201cjust believe me, baby! I\u2019ve changed!\u201d I won\u2019t fall for it again. \n\nI\u2019m so done.\n\nThanks for reading. \u263a\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My body is like that bad boyfriend that you decide to give another chance, and then live to regret it.

I have nightmares about being cut open for surgeries while I am conscious and then wake up in searing pain, realizing that the nightmare was caused by the real life pain.

And, it's easy to become angry and bitter and envious when so much goes into what we don't have. Compare, and despair.\n\nThose are important emotions to sit with and to honour. Trying to suppress them and put a happy face on everything is unnecessary stress and pressure, and frankly, I think it makes everything harder.\n\nAt the same time, it's also important to try and balance this with some recognition of the things that are good in your life.

Two days ago my temperature started plummeting, and this morning my period has come full force. Bummer.\n\nSo, after a lot of painful deliberation, both on my own and with my husband, I've come to the conclusion that I need to put this journey on hold. I haven't given myself a time limit. I don't think that's really necessary. Time limits would just force me to think and plan around trying for a baby, which is exactly what I need to avoid for now in favor of allowing myself some emotional relief. \n\nSo, I guess for conversation's sake, who here has ever taken a break, or are currently on a break?

My intro post can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/33ax4d/intro_and_mini_rant/).\n\nLong story short, my husband had testicular cancer and after chemo another tumor was found that required a major surgery called a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. So not only did chemo effect his fertility, but now he has retrograde ejaculation (nothing comes out but everything else functions perfectly) so we *really* have no chance of trying naturally right now. This may improve with time (years?) or it may not as it is due to nerve damage. \n\nMy husband and I went to Memorial Sloan Kettering in April for his first post-surgical CT scan. Unfortunately, after being told that everything looked good on first look, the final radiology report indicated that there was one suspicious lymph node in his pelvis. Instead of his next CT being in a year, we are going back in September to confirm whether it is just inflammation or another tumor that would require yet another operation. Needless to say we have been pretty crushed as this once again puts everything on hold until we know he will be ok and that this stupid cancer shit is behind us (as much as it every actually can be). \n\nIn early March I was advised by our RE (Shady Grove Fertility) to go off birth control to figure out where my body stands as we prepare for IVF in the coming (insert unknown timeline here... it was supposed to be fall but with the CT scan looming over us we no longer think that it is reasonable). I had one normal period after a 41 day cycle and then nothing. I am on CD45 today and I *think* I might be feeling a little bit of pain in my woman bits but its hard to tell. Also, I have somehow managed to gain about 10 lbs since going off BC, and I have no idea why. I'm not really eating any different and I am actually working out more (2 intense days a week versus nothing before). It is incredibly frustrating. Since my husband's diagnosis in Dec 2013 I have struggled with sudden onset acne issues that I haven't been able to shake and now with the weight gain (I was already 10 lbs over my ideal weight) I have been feeling pretty down and like there might be something off with me. Maybe I am still adjusting to being off of BC/still coping physically with everything we have been through? Any insight? How did you all do when you went off of BC? \n\nOur RE suggested that regardless of our IVF timeline I should consider getting some routine tests this summer to see where I stand (I believe d3 ultrasound and bloodwork, HSG, and I think tests for ovarian reserve). I haven't decided how to proceed yet but with my period failing to make an appearance I haven't been able to move forward anyways. \n\nI have been trying very hard to stay positive and keep living life to the fullest, but I am increasingly aware that we are approaching the time that we planned to try to start out own family. Instead of being excited to try for baby xia, I am worried about my husband's health as well as my own (obviously his much more than mine, but it sucks to feel like your body is a bit out of control...). What doesn't help is that I am absolutely **SURROUNDED** by babies and pregnant women. After a week filled with a baby shower and a big family pregnancy announcement on my husband's side, our best friends announced that they were pregnant with their second when they came to support us at the Relay for Life this weekend. I knew the moment she walked up to us that she was pregnant... and when she said the words my heart sank. It isn't that I'm not thrilled for them, it was just that it wasn't the time or place. We worked so hard to raise money for this great cause on our little two person team and it was a day to celebrate how far we have come and remember those who had lost the fight against their disease. I just felt like it shouldn't have been about their new baby and it really took away from what should have been a very special day for *us*. On top of that, I feel like everyone around me that is pregnant or has kids is constantly complaining to me about said pregnancy or kids and it makes me want to punch them in the face. *Le sigh*\n\nThank goodness for this sub.

They tried his sample on 15 hamster eggs (apparently these are close to human eggs for the purpose of fertilization) and 0 fertilized. My husband is on the low end of normal for count and motility, he's normal for morphology. So he has sperm, and his SA results have always been fine, which is why nobody really did any further digging, until we started gearing up for IVF. \n\nOn the one hand, this explains that we've tried for over two years with not even a chemical pregnancy. Nothing has ever combined in there. I have never had any negative fertility results, my piece of the puzzle seems to be shockingly normal. So I was starting to feel crazy that we'd tried about 26 cycles and had absolutely, positively nothing to show for it. This is awesome closure. On the other hand, this is obviously hard news to take. Our frustrating road has already led us to our first IVF cycle beginning in less than two weeks, and, with these results in hand, we've obviously decided to do ICSI. But I felt something taken from us in that doctor's meeting: The off chance that we'll conceive naturally at some point down the line. I had always hung on to the hope that maybe we just weren't hitting the right luck.\n\nIs there anything that can make a difference with this issue for him? If I had egg problems, I'd be more willing to accept that we're just SOL, because I can't make new eggs. But a man makes new sperm all the time. Is his sperm manufacturing equipment just manufacturing incompetent sperm? Can it stamp them out a little bit differently? Has has anyone done any research and found a method for changing his situation? Like, if he were to take some supplements, etc. etc. etc. etc.\n\nMy understanding is that this is an enzyme issue. The head of his sperm doesn't have the right enzymes for the job. Can it...get them? Somehow? I know I'm in a \"good\" place, relatively, because IVF is good at addressing the exact kind of issue that we have. So that's something to be very grateful for. But I'm struggling with the idea that we'll need assisted reproductive technology for our entire lives if we even want to think about having a baby. \n\nAnyone else in this boat?\n\n(I'm sorry if this triggers anyone.

I have both PCOS and hypothyroidism and have been on Metformin since March. It seemed to regulate my cycle somewhat from what was 45 + long cycles to  28 day cycles for March and April. I was excited as we had planned on May start date for trying to conceive for a while and of course once my progesterone was done in May and was a level 3 this current cycle is going on 38 days now. I'm not pregnant but super discouraged that my first month trying seems to be an anovulatory one and now it's a long cycle too. I'm worried the Metformin has stopped working even tho I'm at max dose.\n\nMy OBGYN had put me on it and wants me to get my day 21 progesterone done every month from here on out. I'm wondering if an RE would be more proactive but it looks like most REs work out of fertility clinics which seem expensive.\n\nI have MSP coverage and my hubby gets benefits that MIGHT cover things thru work but I'm not sure how much it costs and how it works.

The RE thinks that endometriosis is a possible cause (of course, could also be a pelvic infection that I was unaware of), and the HSG also found a small polyp in my uterus.  She suggests laparoscopy to investigate both of these things, and also for the tube removal (salpingectomy). \n\nI have private insurance with Kaiser Permanente and no fertility coverage at all, so I've been going to an outside RE for most of the infertility stuff, though I've done a few basic things with KP and they know what's going on and are getting copies of test results, etc.  I know they're going to try not to cover the salpingectomy because it's related to infertility and IVF prep.  I would expect the endo and uterine laparoscopy to be covered though, as those are related to my health, not infertility.  I am gearing up for a fight with them, because there is no way I can afford both the laparoscopy/salpingectomy *and* IVF.  And I think KP should cover at least the endo/polyp investigation.  \n\nThis might be relevant: a year before seeking treatment for infertility, I had gone to KP because my periods were becoming less regular, and I was experiencing some twinges and strange sensations, and even some pain in my uterine and ovarian areas.  I had increased acne and facial hair, and all of these made me think maybe I had PCOS or that something else was wrong.  My primary care physician did a few basic blood tests and pelvic ultrasound and found nothing.  So I have some history that shows I was investigating my reproductive system health well before and unrelated to infertility investigation.\n\nI'm looking for advice about how to address this with KP and what would my best avenue to get at least part of this covered.  I'll have to get advance approval or there's no way I can afford to move forward.  Any insight, experiences, or suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks, everyone!
