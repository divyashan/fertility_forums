Then she kept going, even though I broke in at one point saying that after everything I have gone through I don't care when it comes, but she didn't stop - just kept right on talking.  \n\nJust a suggestion but if you work for a pharmacy that specializes in fertility medication maybe you should keep these types of things to yourself...but that's just me\n\nUGH!!!!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Engage brain first", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2voyg6/engage_brain_first/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1423781445, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2vpaqd/chat_hangout_tonight/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2vpaqd", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/2vpaqd/chat_hangout_tonight/", "retrieved_on": 1440910887, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'll be there :)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Chat hangout tonight??", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2vpaqd/chat_hangout_tonight/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1423820085, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2vr2lb/friday_trigger/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2vr2lb", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/2vr2lb/friday_trigger/", "retrieved_on": 1440909999, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So I just realized that my nurse said they might trigger today...  and it's Friday the 13th...

We were on 100mg of clomid but I was only able to take four doses because I had visual disturbances.  I think this means that I can't take clomid again.  We did an HCG trigger and then progesterone 2x per day.  We triggered with a 19mm follicle and a 17 or 18mm (I can't remember).  \n\nIUI #1 was with 100mg of clomid for five days, HCG trigger with a 19mm and a 17mm follicle and a bunch of smaller ones.  Plus progesterone twice a day. \n\nBefore that we had two cycles with 50mg of clomid, used OPKs and TI. I ovulated, but I ovulated \"late\" on day 19 and 17. \n\nHSG was clear, hub's SA was good.  Motility is very good and the last IUI had over 100 million sperm.  I am not sure IUI is adding anything for us at this point. I've always ovulated on my own, but its been late (like cd 23-26). \n\nWe've been pregnant twice before- both times naturally, both times very quickly.  The first miscarried and we got pregnant right away afterwards and had a healthy pregnancy. That was five years ago now.  I think back then I had an 11-12 day LP and ovulated around CD17 or so.  I went back on BCP and went off of it in Feb 2014 and we started trying again. I noticed late ovulation and a LPD so we saw an RE in September.  When they did my CD21 blood work (at 7dpo) my progesterone was a whopping 1.2.  It was the day before my period and although it typically indicates no ovulation I always got a +OPK and regular periods, just a short LP. Now here we are. \n\nThe voicemail the nurse left telling me my beta was negative asked what we want to do next and if we had thought about moving forward to IVF. \n\nI don't know what to do.  I feel like its soon to be moving onto IVF... its been just a year and I struggle taking that route without knowing or understanding what is wrong.  If there was a concrete reason I think I'd have a much easier time making that decision.  I feel like my body just forgot what the f its supposed to do. I don't understand why it's struggling now. On the other hand, the growing age gap between my son and any future kid is getting way past where I wanted it to be and I'm feeling anxious about it.  Plus, I'll be 30 in August.  I know its not that old, but still. \n\nI'm not sure its worth it to do another IUI.  With no MFI it seems like it's kind of a waste.  Insurance covers it but honestly the last cycle completely sucked with all the ultrasound monitoring- the RE's office was always running significantly behind and I ended up missing a lot of work. I don't feel like its worth it. Additionally, we are in the midst of relocating and my husband is spending weeks at a time out of state... so the timing to get in for an IUI may very well be impossible. \n\nI was thinking about maybe doing a medicated, unmonitored cycle? I know they'll want to do a baseline u/s, and I'm pretty sure I can't take clomid anymore so I don't know what I could take. Injectables freak me out a bit, and I don't know if they can be taken unmonitored? Someone has mentioned Famera and I might ask them about that.  Then we can just do OPKs and TI? I can go back to temping... \n\nDoes anyone else think its kind of pointless to do another IUI? Is it adding any chance of success for us? Any thoughts on just doing a medicated TI cycle?

I don't think they are helping at all either since there is no MFI going on. \n\nSo the only pinpointed issue was the low progesterone- so we'll try for a few more months with just progesterone support. This summer if we're still unsuccessful we'll move onto IVF with a new clinic. We're relocating to a new state within the next few months anyways. We are going to miss out on full coverage for IVF but I *think* the new insurance I'll have may cover it with a $50k lifetime cap. \n\nMeanwhile I got the OK for taking DHEA for helping with the semi-high FSH (9.5). I am doing the crunchy yoga fertility and maybe acupuncture (mainly so I feel like I'm doing *something* vs nothing).  I'm going to get better more regular sleep and hopefully moving will be a huge increase in our quality of life and lower stress.

I was supposed to get my period Monday and I did start spotting Monday. I also had trouble sleeping the night before but it was a bit different. I kept waking up extremely hot and sweaty. I initially attributed it due to the fact that temperatures are warming up a bit where I live. Well it's Wednesday night and I am still spotting and still having night sweats. Last night I did have a short period of normal sleep due to exhaustion. I am so tired the past couple nights I can barely function. \n\nDesperate, I turned to Dr. Google. \n\nBesides a bunch of diseases and whatnot, my symptoms could mean a. Perimenopause and possible b. Early pregnancy. Now, the only way it could be early pregnancy is if I ovulated late and if I ovulated late it would be very early pregnancy. But premenopause? That has me freaked the fuck out. From what I read it could just be a shift in hormones too and I'm thinking that's my case, that this period is just more messed up than usual, but what the hell?! I can't help but think of all the scenarios from the extremely good to extremely bad and I hate it so god damn much. I refuse to test until I am at least a week late and I hate that I am actually considering I could be pregnant, that my hopes are actually a bit raised. \n\nIf anyone has any insight on night sweats or what I am going through I would appreciate it. From today's off topic I know I am not alone with having to go through the turmoil of a period that is late. Gaaaaaah. \n\nTL;DR: Night Sweats. Late period. WTF. \n\nEdit: so my period is a master troll just like some mentioned. Got it today! I'm angry and relieved at the same time.

It looked like it was declining about 3 days ago, but is definitely still just as dark as the control line. \n\nIs this normal? Anyone ever been misdiagnosed?  Anyone have lh surges for this long?

I feel it worst after I eat, to the point where I'm starting to dread eating.

My RE said my symptoms will worsen and be worst 5 days post retrieval (hello, transfer day). She and the nurses were all adamant that I tell them if I'm not feeling well because pregnancy rates decline if that's the case.

We waited to try for a baby (and now I am full of regret) because 3 months ago I apparently stopped ovulating. No temp spike, changes in cervical fluid started seeming random instead of on any kind of schedule. Pregnancy tests were negative. I also felt a lump in my lower abdomen around the same time this started. \n\nI made a Dr. appt and my period started the day before I was seen, but it was abnormally heavy. The doctor told me my uterus was like that of a 16 week pregnancy but that I was NOT pregnant. An ultrasound revealed simple cysts on both ovaries and tumors (presumably fibroids), the biggest of which was 8cm. I was told I needed surgery and that it would be \"massive.\" I was given the phone number of 2 surgeons and ended up seeing both and they both said the lack of ovulation had nothing to do with the fibroids at all and that they weren't worried about the cysts as they typically resolve without intervention. \n\nOne of the surgeons wanted to do power morcellation to remove the fibroids, but I was scared of cancer as this all came on so suddenly and I don't have any family history or significant risk factors. The doctor ordered an MRI with contrast that I had a few weeks later and even more presumable fibroids were found plus the cysts were still in place. \n\nOn my follow-ups, they checked my TSH, prolactin, did a finger stick for my iron levels, which came back normal. The surgeons were pushing to operate as soon as possible so I could get pregnant, but at this point it had been 2 months with no ovulation. Now on months 3 of the bizarre cycles, I don't even have a period at all and no sign that it will be returning any time soon (I'm on day 46). The doctors (and this is at three different offices now) just tell me that they don't even worry about it until it has been 90 days and then they would just give me a shot to force me to have a period. I told them I didn't want to have surgery that would (in their words) fillet my uterus (open myomectomy) in the hopes of being able to get pregnant if I am not even cycling, but all of them want to argue when I ask for blood work (like estrogen, FSH, free T4, etc.) and act like I am being unreasonable for wanting to figure out what is going on.

Saturday, we'd gotten the  encouraging news that 3 of our donor embryos were able to be biopsied for PGS, with two more still in the running.  I figured that, with a 27-year-old donor, PGS was kind of belt and suspenders, but let's just be safe.\n\nFuck was I wrong as I've been wrong time again through this whole fucking ordeal.  3 of our 4 donor egg embryos tested chromosomally abnormal.  Fuck. My. Life.  Those are the kind of results I hoped for with my own shitty 40-year-old eggs, but for a donor in her 20s, something like 70% should have been normal statistically speaking. I'm not sure if they ended up being able to test the 5th and haven't heard anything more from them about it, so I'm assuming it degenerated.\n\nSo we transferred the single normal embryo.  The doctor was like \"it only takes one ...\" but please spare me that fucking bullshit.  I've had this fluid in my uterus all cycle, and although it appeared to be gone yesterday after having been suctioned out earlier in the week, I am afraid it could have compromised this cycle and now in a week I will be back at square fucking one when my beta's negative.  \n\nSorry for the rant, but I just really expected that a 1:2 donor cycle would leave me with a transfer and at least one healthy embryo to freeze.  What the fuck, was I Adolf Hitler in a past life or something?\n\nUPDATE: the 5th embryo was able to be biopsied for PGS, but results will take 10-14 days.

I only developed one follicle on Femara last cycle.  My husband's sperm is consistently \"outstanding\" according to SAs and post-wash counts, so I am very frustrated with the thought of going through another IUI all for nothing.\n\nAll of the research I have found says the best results for IUIs occur with 2-3 mature follicles at the time of trigger.  If I am going to go through the hassle of missing work (when my office is incredibly short-staffed and my boss gives me shit about taking sick time) I don't want it to be for nothing.\n\nIs it reasonable to insist on some type of modified protocol at this point, or an adjusted dosage to see if I can respond better this cycle? I don't want to go through the hassle of switching practices (to a FAR more inconvenient location, with an unknown RE) to move onto IVF until I feel that I have exhausted every avenue under the RE I adore.  And doing IVF will necessitate missing SO much work, and everyone at work will be angry with me.\n\nOther than that, I have been reading some stuff about how more than three IUIs is reasonable to try if the issue has been anovulatory PCOS and sperm counts are good - should I try more than three IUIs? My insurance will pay for up to 6 total.  I can keep doing IUIs through my current RE.\n\nAll of this just feels so hopeless.  Finding quality, peer-reviewed research on PCOS and fertility treatments other than just Clomid is near impossible, and honestly what research there is clearly means nothing because I had the best odds possible on my last Clomid cycle with IUI (three follicles, post-wash sperm count over 50 million) and got my period early to boot.\n\nI feel like I am standing on the edge of a gigantic pit of despair and the ground is crumbling beneath me.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any point to IUIs with only one follicle?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2wvom2/any_point_to_iuis_with_only_one_follicle/"}, {"author": "waterfall444", "author_created_utc": 1400578818, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "FET soon", "author_fullname": "t2_gn455", "created_utc": 1424717996, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2wwcv4/monday_chat/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2wwcv4", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/2wwcv4/monday_chat/", "retrieved_on": 1440890496, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'll be around on and off all day", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Monday chat?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2wwcv4/monday_chat/"}, {"author": "justcurious12345", "author_created_utc": 1341126508, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC #1, PCOS, IUI #2 on 6/3", "author_fullname": "t2_86s66", "created_utc": 1424747700, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2wy5y4/intro_and_some_questions/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2wy5y4", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 19, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/2wy5y4/intro_and_some_questions/", "retrieved_on": 1440889652, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "tl;dr I have an appointment with a RE on 3-31 and don't really know what to expect. \n\nA little background on me: irregular periods as a teenager, some suspension that I had PCOS, my endocrinologist put me on metformin.  Eventually I went on birth control pills for a couple of years.  When I went off of them I didn't have a period on my own for a year.  Went back on pills, then got a mirena.  No period with mirena, got it removed in October.  Had some withdrawl bleeding, then two months later a very light period.  Lots of spotting, then another light period, followed by constant spotting and now a really heavy period. We've been having unprotected sex since the end of December, but not super frequently (3 times last month).\n\nWith the non-stop spotting I went to my OB/GYN.  Given the possible PCOS in my past, he's eager to send me to a RE.  I was expecting to have to try for a year before I got a referral, but apparently not.  I thought they were officially referring me because of menstrual problems, but today the nurse called to tell me they had scheduled the appointment and was talking about insurance coverage for infertility.  Would they really label me \"infertile\" when we haven't even really been trying and I recently got a mirena removed?  They told me I could go back on the pill to regulate my periods, or if I want to get pregnant I can go to the endocrinologist.  Is this normal?  It seems like we're moving really fast.  On the other hand, if I truly am infertile, I guess it's good to get started sooner rather than later.\n\nAt this upcoming appointment, what kinds of tests should I expect them to do?  They said today they'd do an ultrasound.  I'm assuming also some blood work?  Is it likely that they'll want to test my husband's semen?  Will they really bill my insurance for infertility and not menstrual irregularities?\n\nI told my sister we were not using contraception because I was excited and she's my best friend.  My mom guessed that was the case because I was asking her some questions about her health history, then tricked my sister into confirming it by acting like I had told her. She knows I'm going to an endocrinologist.  She said told my sister that it's God's plan that I can't get pregnant because we're atheists and until we're not in rebellion against God we shouldn't have a baby.
