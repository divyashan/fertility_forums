This just made me feel worse - it means we still don't have any answers.\n\nIn the last 2.5 years we have had 3 miscarriages and we don't have a single clue as to why.\n\nA little info on each pregnancy:\n\n1st: Conceived naturally shortly after my bc was taken out. Miscarried on 8/1/17 at 6w5d. It was anatural miscarriage and I passed everything overnight. No testing was done as it was our firstpregnancy and the OB/GYN didn't think there was anything to it - it was simply 1 in 4 chance.\n\n2nd: Conceived through FET 1.5 years after our first pregnancy (IVF #2). Had a subchorionic bleed.Miscarried on 6/3/19 at 6w3d. Given medication to help the miscarriage along, instead it stoppedit and I had to wait another 2 weeks for it to happen naturally again. I had blood work done but they didn't find anything.\n\n3rd: Conceived through a fresh transfer (IVF #4). Had another subchorionic bleed and baby had a lowHR. RE said there were 2 yolk sacs and that the baby wouldn't survive. We had to wait for theheartbeat to stop before we could do anything. On 12/23/19 no heartbeat detected. D&amp;C on 12/27. I had blood work done and all came back normal.\n\nEvery test we've done has come back normal. SA - above average, egg reserves - normal, no blocked tubes, no preexisting conditions (pcos, endo, etc.), thyroid funtion - normal, IGG/IGM - normal (negative). During each one of our cycles my numbers are all perfect. We did 6 rounds of medicated cycles with timed intercourse with no luck. They said because the SA was normal and I ovulate on my own that IUI wouldn't really better our chances at all. During our IVF cycles all my blood work comes back normal. My RE seems to be somewhat stumped as to what is causing all this. We have an appointment on 1/14/2020 to discuss what our options are to move forward. To be honest I am terrified that they are going to tell us I'm incapable of carrying a baby to term. At this point I am just so tired and frustrated with having no answers and I don't know what to do.

I would really appreciate some advise on what to request from my doctors to try and get pregnant again or to get answers towards our infertility. \n\nMy gynecologist history:\nWe have been trying to get pregnant since 2012 when we got married (I was 18 years old) but even before that we weren\u2019t preventing a pregnancy from happening. I went to my first gynecologist in 2015 - 2016 because we hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant and I was having really painful first day of my period (this lasted from about 2012 - 2017 never got a explanation why or how it stopped). They said I was young and we could try birth control for a few months and when I got off of it we\u2019d get pregnant. That didn\u2019t work. I also got tested for STD\u2019s during that time and results were good. \n\nAfter a couple more appointments with them and getting no help at all I tried a different gynecologist (2nd) in 2016 - 2017. They only wanted to test my thyroid and STD\u2019s and everything came back good. They then tested my husband sperm and it came back he had a very high count but also had a lot that were mutated. They said we still should of gotten pregnant by that point though. So they recommended doing a IUI. We did that once and it didn\u2019t work. The next month they recommended we do a HSG. The radiologist gave confusing messages like my cervix was angled weird and had a hard time getting my uterus to expand and asked if I had ever had pelvic inflammatory disease, which I said not that I ever knew of. The results came back normal and that my tubes were clear. My next appointment with the gynecologist (2nd) I brought up what the radiologist had mentioned and he said we still should of got pregnant before and didn\u2019t seem concerned at all by those remarks. Then his next words were something like \u2018Well your test comes back normal, I can\u2019t tell you why you can\u2019t get pregnant, you should probably look into a specialist\u2019 but didn\u2019t recommend where I should go. I asked to get my hormones tested and then he flat out refused because I have a regular period. We argued back and forth for a bit and he still refused. Five months after that in November 2017 I got pregnant naturally. I will be honest and say I was on a super strict low carb / no sugar diet at the time to lose a little bit of weight but as soon as I found out I was pregnant I went to a normal healthy diet as best I could. \n\nI went to a different obgyn /gynecologist (3rd) because I wasn\u2019t fond of the 2nd one. I gave the run down of our infertility journey up to that point to the nurse Practioner and they didn\u2019t seem worried at my first appointment around my 9 week mark. Unfortunately, when I was almost 13 weeks I miscarried at the ER 2 days before my next appointment. It took me a couple of weeks to feel mentally ready to call again but the hospital and the gynecologist (3rd) gave me zero information on what happened. So my next appointment with the gynecologist (3rd) I basically tried to get my hormones tested again and they refused because my periods were still regular. I then asked him what I should do next and he didn\u2019t give me any ideas only saying everything is normal with us and we should get pregnant but recommended I take chaste berry to regulate any hormone issues naturally if there were any. I took that for about 4 months until my bottles ran out. I also asked for another HSG when I was leaving the last appointment since it might have helped the first time. I had that done in December 2018 and it came back normal. I didn\u2019t do anything fertility related in 2019 but was hoping it would just happen naturally again. If anything I would say both mine and my husbands sex drive has died down. We weren\u2019t focusing on getting pregnant in 2019 so it wasn\u2019t that we stressed ourselves out over it but I think we\u2019ve both gotten depressed and worn out of not getting pregnant. We looked into a fertility clinic in 2019 but they wanted to sell our information in the fine print of the paperwork so we backed out. I would like to make another appointment with my gynecologist but I don\u2019t know if I should find another fertility clinic and just start going there. \n\nSo I would like any advise on what should I do next? I see other people talking about getting their egg quality tested and ultrasounds done of their uterus quality. I haven\u2019t had any of that done and doctors refuse to test hormones on me no matter what I say. So what should I do? What should I request to have done? I want to get pregnant again so badly but I\u2019m just so worn out mentally from not getting any idea of what\u2019s wrong. I know we haven\u2019t technically done a lot of things fertility related but it\u2019s just a lot to take in and I really would like to get a game plan on what I should be working towards because after two years I\u2019m losing my hope that it will happen again naturally. If I need to explain or clarify anything further please just let me know. \n\nThank you for any advise or recommendations in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15988, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for some genuine advice on what to do next.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/emmvuq/looking_for_some_genuine_advice_on_what_to_do_next/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hello__elo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "39 | I have issues", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_281bw2nt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578642809, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/emnv89/hi_amy_lighthearted/", "gildings": {}, "id": "emnv89", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2839f5b6-18df-11e9-8133-0eec4405e856", "link_flair_text": "Introduction", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/emnv89/hi_amy_lighthearted/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1578642810, "score": 1, "selftext": "[Instagram post from Amy Schumer about IVF](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7HShDfpGky)\n\nDon\u2019t read the comments though", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15990, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hi Amy!

Time.)\n\nAnyways back to the facts...\n\nEndochronologist put me on birth control to get my estrogen up because i was having such bad side effects. \nThey also told me to be on it for 3 months to see if it would \u201cjump start\u201d my system.  \n\nI got on birth control and my period returned. I know it was because of the pills but I was hopeful that this would continue once I got off them. \n\nA week ago I was supposed to get my first period while being off birth control. It did not come and I had another hot flash yesterday. That was pretty clear to me that my estrogen didn\u2019t return. \n\nSo here I am with ovaries full of follicles ready to do their job but no ovulation to speak of. \nSo the husband and I are just in limbo now. Can\u2019t even  \u201ctry\u201d for a baby if I\u2019m not ovulating so what do we do? \n\nNext steps are fuzzy as I have to go back to the Endochronologist. \n\nBesides getting pregnant my mind is filled with \u201cwhy is this happening? What is wrong with me medically?? Why does no one care about the why of the situation?\u201d \nIt seems that the doctors don\u2019t care to find why a healthy woman suddenly is not making estrogen but are more than willing to start me on treatments. \n\nThe combo of uncertainty about being able to conceive and worry about my own health can be overwhelming. \n\nSo anyways. Hello everyone. \nMy heart aches for each of you and I am grateful to have a place like this for us all to lean on each other. You are all so strong and are going through so much.

I have three frozen embryos, two of which are PGS normal and one which is missing a copy of Chromosome 2, which is incompatible for life. For the past year, I have blissfully been thinking we still have two more good chances to have a baby.\n\nAt my appt on Tuesday, we discovered that our remaining two PGS embryos are 3AB and 2BC. So not great. But especially not the 2BC. \n\nI was on Tricare last year (no infertility coverage) but this year I am on my work insurance plan which thankfully has infertility coverage (although I am $7,000 away from my max allotment). So I asked my husband, and he agrees, that perhaps we should transfer the 2BC first, for a couple reasons. \n\nWhile I am working full time at this company and paying for the insurance, it makes more sense to hedge our loss: if we transfer the 2BC  this year and it doesn't work, we can transfer the 3AB a few months afterward, still in the yer 2020, so it will be covered. After that we are all done with embryos, and I will not be coming back for another (third) round of IVF stims. I'm done after these transfers.\n\nIf we transfer the 3AB first and it takes, then hallelujah, but then we are paying for another 2 years (min) of embryo storage (which is $700/year), and when we come back to do the transfer of the 3BC embryo (because I will NOT leave my PGS normal embryo without at least trying), we will be paying cash as I will no longer be working full time and have that insurance. \n\nSo it make sense, right? Except that now I feel very discouraged mentally. Like I'm preparing for this next transfer but I shouldn't really get too excited because it is statistically less likely. And then all the pressure will be on the next/last transfer of the 3AB. And that will be so much pressure, I'm not sure I could handle it because nothing is guaranteed. Although I guess I'm not sure it would be any different if we did the 3AB first - then if it didn't take, I guess I would be more or less accepting that we aren't having a baby in 2021, and I would go through the motions with the 2BC just because. I wouldn't have to hold my breath as long.\n\nUgh. IDK. I'm having a hard time. Encouragement? Suggestions? Thoughts? Any success with 3AB's and especially 2BC's that are PGS normal?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15994, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Transfer the Poor or Fair first?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/emsj89/transfer_the_poor_or_fair_first/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "burnerforprivacy_19", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4psuedv9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578676597, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/emtzt0/experience_with_sher_institute_new_york/", "gildings": {}, "id": "emtzt0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 24, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/emtzt0/experience_with_sher_institute_new_york/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1578676604, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone, I first posted here a few months ago with a [record](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dckcqj/need_advice_for_next_steps_33f_poi_uterine/) of my diagnoses and treatment history thus far, and am now appealing to the community with another question.

I\u2019m a first-time poster to this sub, though I\u2019d been lurking for about a month as we approached the year mark. I have been active on TFAB and more recently on TTC30. I wanted to introduce myself as I expect to be more active in this group moving forward and seek out some advice.\n\nFirst the TL;DR \u2014 I found out today that my mom likely had undiagnosed endometriosis. So I\u2019m wondering if I have silent endo, my only symptom being infertility. If so, how does that change my testing and treatment plan?\n\nThe details/introduction:\n\nMy husband and I have been TTC unsuccessfully for exactly a year. (We\u2019re on cycle 13 now.) We had a consultation with an RE this week. (This sub\u2019s wiki was amazing to prepare. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb)\n\nMy husband\u2019s October SA came back with strong numbers, save morphology at 3%. Because it\u2019s an isolated result, my RE isn\u2019t particularly concerned. \n\nI\u2019ll undergo testing next cycle, including CD3 blood work and an SHG. Based on SHG, she said she might progress to HSG that same day. At that point, we expect to have a specific diagnosis.\n\nI have light-to-medium, two-sometimes-three-day periods that last 26-29 days with an 11-day LP. (I get positive OPKs between CD15-19, normally CD16.) I do spot on either side of my period, as early as six days before once, so she\u2019ll look for polyps with SHG. She said nothing in my medical background indicates a need for an HSG. (I haven\u2019t had any surgeries and I have virtually no period symptoms, beyond headaches.)\n\nShe did a vaginal ultrasound during the consult (that I found fascinating, as an aside). I was on CD8 and had a 14mm follicle our of my right ovary that she said will drop this cycle\u2019s chosen egg. She called both ovaries \u201cbeautiful\u201d and nothing appeared problematic. My lining was 4.4, also a fine measurement for that part of my cycle, she said. \n\nThat info/plan all sounds good and well to me. However.\n\nI found out today that my mom likely had endometriosis, undiagnosed bc of the state of health care at the time and how (un)seriously docs took women\u2019s pain. So I\u2019m wondering if I have silent endo, my only symptom being infertility.\n\nMy mom had painful periods and heavy bleeding and was getting her period every two or three weeks. She was getting anemic as a result and on iron shots. They discovered benign tumors/cysts in her uterus. She had a hysterectomy. (She was 38 at the time and had had three children by then. I\u2019m 30.)\n\nI didn\u2019t know any of this ahead of my appointment, so I obviously couldn\u2019t tell my RE. When should I bring it up and should I now request HSG? (Right now I plan to call on CD1 to schedule the testing we discussed.) How hard should I push if she doesn\u2019t think an HSG is necessary? Is there different/additional testing that would be reasonable given this information?\n\nTIA for any insight/comments/links/additional reading.

I am new to this sub and thought I\u2019d introduce myself before posting in the dailies. I am relatively early in my journey. Yesterday was CD1 of cycle 9 TTC (unassisted) which means that we are entering the next chapter of our journey. A little bit of background: I am 38 years old. Through my OB/GYN, I've had a 7DPO progesterone blood draw (13.8 ng/mL) and CD3 hormones: AMH - 2.0 ng/mL, Estradiol - 60.2 pg/mL, FSH - 11.2 mIU/mL (slightly elevated), LH - 6.5 mIU/mL. HSG showed patent tubes and husband had a normal SA. I\u2019ve gone all out and have been tracking my cycles using bbt and cm since November 2018 (with confirmed ovulation every cycle) and used that to appropriately time our attempts once we were ready. Finally saw an RE in December who gave us a diagnosis of unexplained. Our options are IUI with monitored Clomid and HCG trigger or IVF with embryo banking. We\u2019ve decided to start the medicated/monitored IUI cycles so I go in tomorrow for my baseline CD3 ultrasound and bloodwork and to start Clomid. I don\u2019t really have any questions that I haven\u2019t found the answers to (*yet*). I\u2019ve done a lot of searching and reading in this and other subs. I hope this is an ok standalone post!

Having never had a positive pregnancy test before that point, it was particularly devastating.  Just when I thought I was doing better, about three weeks later our best friends (who had been having some trouble conceiving themselves) gave birth to their first child, which ripped the would right open for me.  It's been a rough month and a half, but ... it is getting better.\n\nMy wife has been remarkably tough through this entire process, however she is *extremely* averse to people giving her empty outpourings of sympathy, and as a result has generally had me \"run interference\" by either requesting people not bring it up to her, or having me do the talking.  It's not the way I want to deal with things, but I have respected and not questioned her opinion on the matter.\n\nNobody in either of our immediate families has ever had a miscarriage, so the truth of the matter is that nobody has any idea what to say.  And I haven't been perfect in my communication either, at one point sharing an image with my mom (can't find it now) asking people to spare us empty platitudes in favor of just being there for us; and I made an extremely rude and passive-aggressive comment to my whole family (who was texting and gushing over pictures of my niece and nephew as if nothing had happened).\n\nWhether it's a result of my actions or not, I had felt my family was not handling the issue with the appropriate level of delicacy and sensitivity: Sending the photos without even asking if it was okay.  Apparently ignoring the blog I put together, mainly for their benefit to read about things.  Cancelling coming in for Christmas (the reasons were valid) but then suggesting I abandon my grieving wife right after the holidays to visit them instead.  Not bothering to relay Snapchats I made for my nephew (22 seconds out of their busy day to show it is too much, I guess).\n\nWhatever.  I'm an an adult.  You can't expect yourself to be the center of other peoples' lives.  Regardless, I vented about all of this to my mother, and -- while I will admit that she was trying to make a valid point -- she framed the response in a way that was misinterpreted by both my wife and I as (1) \"imitating\" our mixed messages, in an almost derisive way (2) blaming us for making everyone else confused about how to act around us.\n\nShe backpedaled and tried to explain what she was trying to say (I am **no** stranger to having things come out wrong), but by then my wife had stormed off.  When I found her, she was crying harder than I'd ever seen her cry during this process -- and maybe ever.  Seeing her like that, after she had outwardly been so strong, was pretty devastating.  And of course, she doesn't want to have anything to do with my mom right now (and I'm irritated too).\n\nI at least tried to use the knowledge (\"people are confused about how to act around us\") to clarify things with other people in my immediate family, but... ultimately, I'm closer to my mother than anyone else in my family.

I am concerned that I might actually have lean PCOS although my current RE has decided I don't meet all of the diagnostic criteria. I'm hoping that there might be a few folks out there who have dealt with my symptoms, might have some suggestions on additional testing, and perhaps even a successful TTC story to share.\n\nIn my late teens and early twenties, I was very athletic, thin, and started to get bad cramps and an increase in facial hair that my mom was convinced was genetic because she went through the same thing. I ended up going on birth control (Yasmin) prescribed by my doctor due to high-normal testosterone levels for about 8 years on and off (from about age 18 to 26) and this made my symptoms (excess hair, period cramps) marginally improve. Eventually in my mid-twenties, I decided I didn't want to be on medication anymore, so I quit birth control and didn't really notice any changes except that my cramps got increasingly worse with time over the years.\n\nNow, at 35 years old, a decade later, we are trying to conceive, and after about a year of trying naturally, we just enlisted the help of an RE a couple of months ago. After some diagnostic testing, it turns out that I have a very high AMH of 15.38 ng/ml  coupled with low (but just within normal range) testosterone and DHEA-S, FSH/LH one cycle was approx 5/7, another cycle was approx 5/10. My antral follicle counts for the past two cycles were 30 and 24 (aren't these counts quite high for my age and indicative of PCO?), I apparently ovulate regularly but with varying cycle length (28 to 37 days). (Additionally, but perhaps unrelated, it turns out I have an endometrioma on my right ovary roughly 2.5cm diameter).  I should also note that I remain thin at 5'-7\" and 125lbs and naturally athletic, and within the past few months developed slight lower cheek and neck cystic acne after years of clear skin.\n\nAfter the diagnostic testing, my RE has yet to give either of us a diagnosis; she told me that although I lean towards PCOS, she wouldn't diagnose me and I'm wondering if her reservation is due to the lower androgen levels. She proposed a medicated and monitored cycle of IUI because of my ultra high AMH. The cycle consisted of Day 3 US showing 24 follicles, Letrozole 2.5mg days 3-7, Day 9 monitoring showing 2 mature follicles (I believe around 18mm), followed by an Ovidrel trigger shot evening of Day 9, subsequent IUI on Day 11, and ovulation confirmed by BBT on morning of Day 12. We are now in the 2-week wait, and as patient as I want to be, I can't help but do additional research on our particular case.\n\nSide note to this fertility discussion is that one of my husband's sperm analyses (and we are awaiting a followup analysis) showed 0 morphology, but otherwise normal range scores.\n\nMy questions for lean PCOS folks out there: did any of you exhibit increased facial hair and higher testosterone in your teens and early twenties, followed by a substantial decrease in your early thirties, but persistantly high AMH and AFC? And did you end up trying to conceive in your thirties? Did you need ART? And what protocols ended up working for you?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16043, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New to the Forum: Trying To Conceive and Questions About Lean PCOS Diagnostic Criteria", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eobind/new_to_the_forum_trying_to_conceive_and_questions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "letterstogralex", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "38M/37F, tubal/unexplained, PGS FET#1 CP", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5dpwpd4u", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578962469, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eodd36/a_whole_new_level_of_appreciation_for_my_wife/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eodd36", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/eodd36/a_whole_new_level_of_appreciation_for_my_wife/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1578962469, "score": 1, "selftext": "I wanted to make a somewhat positive post: A tribute to my wife.\n\nFor most of the last decade, my wife worked as a foster care case manager.  She worked with kids who had been removed from their biological parents' care because they were subjected to neglect, abuse and/or endangerment.  Her job was to ensure their well-being and strive for a \"permanency,\" which means (ideally) reunification with the biological parents; if not, then adoption or guardianship.\n\nShe had to visit with biological parents to make sure they were doing what they needed to do in order to regain custody of their children, ensure the children were doing well in their foster homes, coordinate services, and attend court hearings where it was decided whether to reunify children with their parents or terminate the parents' rights.\n\nThis job is widely perceived to be low-paying, highly stressful and extremely demanding.  Most people either use it as a brief stepping stone to better things in their career, or burn out after a year or two.\n\nShe did it for almost **nine years.**  This involved taking calls in the middle of the night to go sit with foster kids in the hospital, having to cancel plans and leave events because of a work emergency, driving halfway across the state on a regular basis, and be threatened and yelled at and called names.\n\nAll through this, I think I saw her cry once.  I can remember another incident or two where she recalled crying, but that was it.  Contrast with me, who gets emotional when I give a poorly-received PowerPoint presentation.\n\nShe may have her quirks, but on things that matter, I really think she's one of the toughest people I know.\n\nAnd, oblivious as I am, I don't think I've been fully appreciative of this until we started IVF.\n\nShe's gotten, by my count, over 100 shots from me -- probably more -- plus lots of blood draws, plenty of uncomfortable transvaginal ultrasounds (with and without fluid injected inside her uterus), a painful procedure where they inflated a balloon in her uterus to squirt dye into her Fallopian tubes, a painful scraping of her uterine lining... and I think her biggest complaint might have been about my facial expression when I saw blood on the ultrasound probe once.\n\nWhen the egg retrieval left her in near-crippling pain on every bump in the road, I asked her if we should cancel our vacation (I had gotten trip insurance just in case); she said no.\n\nAfter the embryo transfer, when she woke up in the middle of the night with crippling cramps that had her rolled up in a ball, I kept suggesting we go to the ER; she said she was fine.\n\nWhen she was losing the pregnancy over Thanksgiving weekend (which we didn't know at the time, although we feared it due to her symptoms), she wanted to go Christmas tree shopping.\n\nWhen she learned the news from the nurse that she had miscarried, she called me and said \"Well, it's not the news we were hoping for.\"  Meanwhile, I could barely even speak when relaying the news to our parents.\n\nWhen her cousin brought her new baby over on Christmas, I started to get a little teared up watching her feed the baby; she fed her without giving away any sense of sadness.\n\nWhen we went to visit our friends in the hospital after they gave birth to a child three weeks after our miscarriage, I was basically hysterical and had to take something to calm me down; she rocked the baby and didn't bat an eye.\n\nWhen she watched an all-day marathon of *Sex and the City* that heavily featured an eerily relevant (to us) infertility plotline, I was getting teary-eyed just listening to it while doing other  things; she watched it just fine.\n\nI think I've seen her cry about it four times over the month and a half since our loss.  For myself, I've lost count.\n\nBut I know it's bugging her.  She keeps waking up in the middle of the night.  She doesn't like talking about it with most people.  She did ask for me to leave the room when I was on the phone with someone who was having a loud conversation about the fun things someone was doing with their children.\n\nBut, she carried on like a champion and has shown no signs of stopping.\n\nI don't know how she does it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16047, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A whole new level of appreciation for my wife.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eodd36/a_whole_new_level_of_appreciation_for_my_wife/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "01010101010010", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_dsvmo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578978515, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eogplw/psa_infertility_lifetime_max_and_changing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eogplw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/eogplw/psa_infertility_lifetime_max_and_changing/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1578978516, "score": 1, "selftext": "After a difficult and unsuccessful 2019 where we used up all 25k of our United Healthcare lifetime infertility benefit, we were left wondering what was next in 2020.  Dreading the prospect of paying fully out of pocket, we were desperate to find a way to get additional infertility coverage.  \r\n\r\nIn 2019, my wife was on her employer\u2019s United plan, so we naturally wondered if switching to my employers plan, which also happened to be United, would give her a new lifetime infertility maximum.  \r\n\r\nMy initial internet searches didn\u2019t fill me with confidence.  Maybe I wasn\u2019t reading the right forums, but the consensus seemed to be that the infertility max wouldn\u2019t reset by switching from her company\u2019s United plan to my United plan.  The justification being that she was still using the same insurance company and therefore subject to the same lifetime maximum.  Luckily I continued my researching with our infertility provider\u2019s billing team and United customer reps, because this morning my wife met with United\u2019s preauthorization nurse who confirmed she has used zero of her 25k medical max and zero of her 20k Rx coverage.   \r\n\r\nWe are absolutely relieved, and I really wanted to share our experience as a data point for anyone dealing with a similar situation.  That... and I hate United with a passion, so the more you folks can\u2019t get out of them the better!  \r\n\r\nFor full disclosure, we are located in Illinois, so please confirm that laws are not different in your state.  At least for Illinois, my conclusion is as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tSwitching from one insurance company to a completely different one will absolutely result in a new lifetime infertility maximum\r\n\r\n2.\tWhen switching from a spouse\u2019s plan to the other person\u2019s (different employers), the lifetime infertility maximum also resets\u2026 even if the insurance company is the same.\r\n\n3.\tChanging jobs, would trigger a new lifetime maximum with the new employer\u2019s plan.\n\r\n4.\tInsurance companies try to scare people by calling it a LIFETIME infertility maximum.  A more accurate description should be a maximum employer plan infertility maximum.  \n\nWhat I can not speak to is what happens if you simply select a different plan offered by your employer without changing insurance company (i.e. from Company ABC\u2019s high deductible United plan to United\u2019s low deductible plan).  I doubt this would reset things, but it\u2019s worth a call to your Fertility providers billing office.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love for other\u2019s to share their experience, so this post can be a resource for others going forward.  If any one has hd any conflicting experiences, please let me know and I will edit my post accordingly.  Also, I\u2019m happy to answer any questions, so I can help clarify anything in my confusing, long-winded message.\r\n\r\nStay strong everyone!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16048, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "PSA: Infertility Lifetime Max and Changing Insurance Plans", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eogplw/psa_infertility_lifetime_max_and_changing/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Shalar79", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "39 | POI/POF (idiopathic) | 2 failed IUIs | 1 failed IVF ", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2lpqlk4j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578988018, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eoi8rs/progyny_and_carrot_insurance_plans/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eoi8rs", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/eoi8rs/progyny_and_carrot_insurance_plans/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1578988021, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16052, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Progyny and Carrot insurance plans", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eoi8rs/progyny_and_carrot_insurance_plans/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578996484, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eoje6g/tuesday_am_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eoje6g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 104, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/eoje6g/tuesday_am_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1578996489, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!\n\nUse this thread to share things that are NOT specific to treatment.

Today, the results of my second opinion scan/CD3 bloodwork from an RE (which I insisted on, even though I was told to just \u201crelax\u201d and wait for my cycle to come back after quitting BC) are in: I have anovulatory \u201clean\u201d PCOS. LH/FSH ratio nearly 3:1 and I have polycystic ovaries. AMH 5.9. Testosterone 1.8 nmol/l. Now, I can\u2019t get in for a consultation on next steps/treatment for another month.\n\nI can\u2019t believe it took this long to get diagnosed - I want to rip my hair out! It doesn\u2019t help that since I was worried hypothalamic amenorrhea might be playing a role in my lack of periods (since I was a regular runner with a history of dieting) I cut out cardio/started eating more and have gained nearly 10lbs in the last 5 months, which now seems to have been completely unnecessary and maybe even counterproductive. \n\nAnyway, since I have to wait for another appointment, I\u2019ve been googling the heck out of lean PCOS, but of course this has led to more questions than answers. I am curious to hear about your experiences with ovulation induction, etc\u2026 is Metformin something to ask about? TI versus IUI? Anything I should be doing diet-wise?\n\nNow that I have a diagnosis, I know I should probably pose these kinds of questions in r/TTC_PCOS, but I was still interested to see if you have any advice while I hunker down for a few weeks of waiting/fretting.

Apologies in advance for the wall of text that follows. I guess I\u2019m just looking to vent/commiserate, but would love to hear about other folks\u2019 experiences with any of the issues I\u2019m dealing with.\n\nSo I was diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Failure about 10 years ago. I was 24, and while it was a bit of a shock, I was at a place in my life where the possibility of children was soooo far off my radar (I was young, single, poor, and not emotionally ready for family) that the diagnosis was not really an earth-shatterer.\n\nFast forward to a few years ago, I\u2019m blissfully married, more financially stable, with a man who very much wants children and I very much do, too. After several years of flirting with adoption, we eventually decided to try for a genetically \u201chis\u201d child, and started meeting with our RE about a year ago. Since I already had a clear diagnosis, we were able to dive straight in to the wonderful/horrible world of donor eggs. We (clearly naievly) thought that having finally made the BIG decision to go this route, that things would move along rapidly.\n\nHow freaking wrong we were.\n\nIt feels like the process of finding a donor is totally IMPOSSIBLE. I\u2019m sure this is because of a combination of being both very \u201cpicky\u201d about finding someone who is a good match (physically, and personality-wise) with me, and the fact that I have some apparently not-super-common physical characteristics. Our clinic has a truly shitty list of donors at least as far as what we\u2019re looking for, and while we\u2019ve found a few promising donors at an agency, the exponentially higher cost of going that route is really hard for my husband to swallow. \n\nWe\u2019re also running into communication issues with our clinic: while our actual RE is great and generous, the staff at her office in various roles makes dealing with anything a huge freaking headache. Given that we plan to move across the country in the summer, we\u2019re seriously considering dumping this clinic and just starting from scratch when we move....BUT HOLY LORD the idea of purposefully stalking for ANOTHER six months before we even BEGIN seems too terrible for words right now.\n\nOn top of all this, the prospect of impending pregnancy (in combination with a bunch of other unrelated to infertility factors) have caused my previously well-managed eating disorder to rear its ugly head, and I\u2019m now dealing with simultaneously trying to get my body/mind healthy enough to carry, AND all the usual treatment/infertility/egg donor logistics and crap. It just feels like SO MUCH to deal with, and right now both sides of it feel utterly hopeless. \n\nAnyway, just looking for hope/commiseration/help/stories/anything to make it seem like this is possible, worth it, and that it will some day be OVER. \n\nAlso, hi.

Also, buckle up, because this bad boy is going to be long. &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHi there. I have been lurking for a while, and finally got the guts to introduce myself and share my experiences so far. My journey has been a little different than average. &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI am a 29 year old woman. My mom experienced premature menopause when she was ~30, shortly after I was born - the cause was unknown because they didn't have the genetic testing back then that they do now. About 4-5 years ago I was in a med school lecture given by a pediatric endocrinologist, and she mentioned briefly that all women who experience POI should undergo screening for Fragile X premutations. This really stuck in my head, so I asked my OB/gyn about whether I should be concerned. His response was, \"Really? I've never heard of that. Most of the time POI is totally random, and just because your mom had it doesn't mean you will have it too. I wouldn't be concerned.\" I felt a little reassured, and after all, I was not even trying to get pregnant at the time, so I tried to put it out of my head. One year later, I got a new OB/gyn since my previous one moved on to a new practice. I asked him the same question, and his response was essentially the same. But I still couldn't shake this nagging feeling and would continue to bring it up at my annual visits. Finally he offered me a referral to a genetic counselor. &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWell, guess what? I found out last fall that I am indeed a Fragile X premutation carrier. And my repeat expansion number is so high that it has a nearly 100% chance of expanding into the full mutation in the next generation. &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNow, I am still not interested in getting pregnant at this exact moment in time. I'm still in school (yes, even after all this time - I'm doing an extended program), and I'm not married. But my boyfriend of 3 years and I really want to get married and have children in the future - preferable when I am in residency and we have a little more money. So right away, we went to a fertility specialist to talk about freezing my eggs to do IVF and PGD in the future. Trying to conceive without IVF &amp; PGD is not an option for us because due to the mutation, we essentially would have a 50/50 chance of having a child with a potentially severe intellectual disability. My workup right off the bat was not reassuring. At age 29, my AMH was only 0.64. My doctor said that she would be THRILLED if we got 10 eggs but that we had to be prepared for a poor outcome. To complicate things, I also had a 6 cm ovarian cyst that we had to contend with before we could start my stim cycle. Finally, if any of you are familiar with the way med school works, you know that 3rd year clerkships are extremely regimented to the point of making it nearly impossible to take time off for multiple doctor visits and procedures. &amp;nbsp;\n\n\n(Can I just say here what a nightmare it was to have to do a rotation in OB/gyn for school while I was going through all this? For a whole month I would literally get off the phone with my doctor in the morning after talking about the status of my cyst and my upcoming stim cycle and my shitty prospects, then have to go into patients' rooms and paste a big fake smile on my face while I rubbed gel on their big pregnant bellies and obtained their fetal heart tones and planned for their deliveries. And at the same time that I was trying to come to grips with the fact that I might never be a mom, I would have to assist in the delivery room. I tried so hard to hide how terrible I felt and how much I resented those women who didn't deserve my resentment, and it was awful and I am so happy that I am done with that rotation and never have to do that ever ever again.) &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWe had to wait a couple months until I had a little vacation, but finally I did the stim cycle and retrieval. We did a microdose lupron cycle because my doctor said it is better for women with diminished ovarian reserve. I had 7 promising follicles on day 4, 6 on day 6... eventually down to 5 decent looking follicles on day of retrieval. That was really hard, watching the numbers go down. And then only 3 mature eggs after retrieval. Into the freezer they went. I can't help thinking, all that money for only 3 eggs? Especially considering that we're assuming that half of my eggs have the Fragile X gene to start with? It has been really difficult coming to grips with the thought that this all might have been for nothing. I know there is still a chance with 3 eggs, but... it's not good. &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn addition to the usual infertility nightmare stuff I've already described, here are some additional things causing me extreme anxiety- &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nFinances - the insurance provided to me by the medical school does not cover any kind of infertility treatments whatsoever. Everything for my cycle was out of pocket (i.e. on a credit card with an intro offer that we are slowly trying to pay off.) We don't have the means right now to do another cycle. I am on a measley stipend to get through school, and my boyfriend was laid off about 5 months ago and only recently got a new job, so our finances have been really tight. A crazy bright spot is that we found out his new job offers coverage for infertility services, but his insurance doesn't actually kick in until March (60 day post-hire period.) We are seriously considering having a shotgun wedding so that I can get on his insurance to do more stim cycles. Which is crazy. It's crazy right? We have actually been planning on getting married, but not for a year or two, when I'm done with school and we could have a big traditional wedding. And now we are considering just going to the courthouse within the next month for the insurance benefits. I want to laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of it all. &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhich leads me to family - my mom is 100% on board with me doing IVF and is gunning for me to do another stim cycle. She really wants to loan me money to help out, but my dad is super Catholic and against IVF. Discarding embryos, even if they have Fragile X, is against his religious belief that all life is sacred and needs to be protected. This disagreement has obviously been causing a lot of tension in the family. It's breaking my heart because I love my dad very much - he's actually a great dad and I still consider him one of my best friends - and now I feel like I can't talk with him at all about this horrible thing in my life. Whenever I call home, we have to dance around this issue and it has honestly become very painful and makes me feel even more lonely than I already do. He has reluctantly accepted the egg freezing (because at least they're not fertilized embryos yet), but he know's what's coming next. (And can you imagine how much he would flip out if we got married in a courthouse? Again, I'm almost laughing at the craziness of it all.) &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nFinally, I am dealing with a lot of anger. I am especially angry with my current OB/gyn and the one before him, because if they had known a little more about Fragile X premutations (which are NOT a rare cause of POI), I would have gone through this 4-5 years ago, and who knows how many more eggs we could have gotten back then? &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI am trying to stay positive. 3 good eggs is better than none. Also my boyfriend has been incredibly supportive during all of this, and I really think this experience has brought us closer together. We also have a couple of good friends who are genuinely interested in our progress and ask us questions about it (instead of a lot of people who throw out that \"I'm here if you need to talk\" garbage cop-out without ever actually asking me how I'm doing. I'm sure you guys know what I mean.) We all had dinner together the night before my retrieval and they asked me lots of questions about the stim cycle and how the retrieval would go. Then the next day they messaged me wanting to know how it went. It felt really nice, because until recently I have been relatively tight lipped about this whole experience.

SA was postponed to Dec 2018, as we couldn\u2019t get in to the doctor(required a welcome meeting at the local fertility clinic as it was the only place that does them). My sono came back that I may have a slight septum but everything else looked fine (ps. This was the worst medical experience I\u2019d ever had). After we got the results from his SA, which were not great but still had hope, we were referred to an RE (Feb 2019).

I\u2019ve been lurking various TTC threads since my husband and I began TTC in June 2019. We recently saw the RE and started testing, and based on the results so far (still more to do) I think this sub is the right place to be (plus so you all seem so wonderfully supportive, and I could use some of that right now - I promise to give it back to you all as well!). \n\nQuick backstory - my husband and I got married in May 2019, I stopped birth control, and we started trying in June 2019. Our biggest obstacle is being older - I\u2019ll be 36 in a few weeks and he is 48. I am thrilled to have found the love of my life and we are SO wanting to have a family together. Neither of us tried to have children until now. We had a CP in Nov after 2 weeks of positive tests - it sucked. My cycle was super regular right off the bat after birth control, but given our ages I wanted to see the RE after 6 months. I saw the RE in Dec and just did my blood tests. Felt good about the first results that rolled in - everything checked out ok including FSH. Vitamin D a smidge low at 27 so I started taking that. But then today my AMH came in at 0.517, which led to a flurry of googling and worry. Husband will do his SA within the next couple of weeks and I\u2019ll have an HSG in Feb and then we\u2019ll meet with the RE again. \n\nI\u2019m trying to not get too ahead of myself because we don\u2019t have all of the data yet and of course we\u2019ll have to see what the RE says, however my husband and I have already agreed and if she thinks IVF would be an option for us we might want to jump on it ASAP. We definitely don\u2019t have unlimited financial reserves, but we are financially secure and are ready to pursue it from a financial perspective. I guess I can\u2019t tell whether my anxiety is leading to a rash decision of just going all in with IVF right away, or whether this is actually totally rational and would be the best option to jump to if we are dealing with DOR and older partners. We would be thrilled to have any children at all, and more than one would be amazing, so I suppose there\u2019s some allure to the idea of having embryos to freeze for later as well (I totally get that IVF is a hard road and no guarantee though). Has anyone else been in this situation or have advice? I am just starting this journey and don\u2019t know anyone else who is dealing with it or has been through it so I\u2019m feeling quite alone.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16065, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How quickly did you move to IVF?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eoxtmo/how_quickly_did_you_move_to_ivf/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Krystal826", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2hgx6ykh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579068657, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eoyhga/hunger_games_result_and_advice_needed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eoyhga", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/eoyhga/hunger_games_result_and_advice_needed/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1579068658, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI had my egg retrieval last week at they retrieved 33 eggs, 19 were mature, 12 fertilized with ICSI, three made it to day 5 blasts and were biopsied on day 6.

I've been incredibly blessed with two boys aged 8 and 6. My older son has Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nAfter going through severe post natal depression with my second son, who was a cranky baby and I ended up feeling I was a worthless mother (one child has a terminal condition, can't even get the second to stop crying) we delayed trying for a third.\n\nIn 2018 I felt mentally strong enough to go for it and go pregnant right away. First scan at 8 weeks showed a heartbeat, but two weeks later, nothing.\n\nI was upset but I felt it's luck of the draw. Sometimes this happened.\n\nThen, I just couldn't get pregnant. I went to two different obgyns who basically brushed me off saying be patient, even though inside me I felt it was off to go from being super fertile to nothing.\n\nAfter 1.5 years of trying, I got a positive test in November. I was scared and apprehensive but also over the moon to welcome this very much wanted piece of joy into our family. 8 week scan showed a heartbeat.\n\nDue to my son's muscular dystrophy I have to get CVS testing on each pregnancy. It involves being jabbed in the belly with a big needle to extract placental tissue.\n\nMy test was on Monday when I would have been 12 weeks. I was very calm and said to my husband \"im not scared of the needle. I just want to see the baby and heart its heart\"\n\nI went in for my test, keeping my eyes on the monitor. The Dr begins asking questions. My heart sinks but I think \"stay positive\". Then, he turns the monitor away so I can't see.\n\nMy baby stopped growing at 9 weeks. I am devastated beyond words, and I feel destroyed because we had decided due to how hectic our life is with a disabled  child that this would be our last attempt.\n\nI also feel heartbroken because I am so blessed to have my two kids, and the joy of their existence is only reminding me that I won't have a third little piece of heaven to join us. We would have made such a good unit.\n\nIn with that, I'm angry. Angry that both doctors I saw just waved me off and told me to be patient and I'd get pregnant, nothing's wrong. Something IS wrong, I wish they had taken me seriously. Maybe right now I'd  be announcing my happy news..instead I'm cocooned in silence because I told none of my family I was pregnant and given how it went, I'll keep it to myself.\n\nThanks for listening,x", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16068, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "\"I just want to hear a heartbeat and I'll be okay\" triggers: secondary infertility, miscarriage", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eoz9yf/i_just_want_to_hear_a_heartbeat_and_ill_be_okay/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579079211, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eozzp3/welcome_wednesday_thread_intros_newbie_questions/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eozzp3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/eozzp3/welcome_wednesday_thread_intros_newbie_questions/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1579079212, "score": 1, "selftext": "Are you new to r/infertility?
