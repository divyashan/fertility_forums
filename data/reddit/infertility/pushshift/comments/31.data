Even if this whole infertility BS ends up permanent, and we never get biological children, then I will grow old happy and CF with the man who makes my world go around.  If he left me to \"help me\" he'd be doing nothing more than making me into a spinster.  I love him far more than unconceived children. I would take a bullet in the uterus for him. \n\nNow, he's said some of the things you have.  Since he has a chronic illness (MS), it's something we've gone through quite a bit, actually. We talked rationally about our situation, and he made it known that donor sperm was still on the table for us if there's nothing more he can do about his quality/motility.  In the end, we both felt that was the only rational concession he could make that would give *US* a better chance at becoming parents. \n\nI highly recommend couples therapy. This self resentment you have can bleed out into your relationship and poison the well. Trust me on this.  Once the well is poisoned, it gets progressively harder to clear it back up.  Being honest with a therapist will give you tools to deal with these very real feelings in a healthy way, so that you two can tackle them together. \n\nWe all are entitled to the occassional pity party. But nuking a beautiful relationship to keep the party alive is not ok. \n\nSending you both hugs. Negatives are always so difficult.
