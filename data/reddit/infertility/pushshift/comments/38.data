Following a retained placenta and infection with my first I stopped having a period. I've basically been in pain since the day I gave birth. I appear to not be ovulating. I had a scan done on CD10 and I had 3 follicles, one too small, one just right, and one too big. Last week which was cd22 and I had 11 follicles, of which only one was within the normal range.

She has a four hour drive to get to us, which is why she needs more than a day's advanced notice. Anyway, We have had this visit on the books since January, so I look inept cancelling this close to the visit. I've waited to say something though because I didn't know how this IVF cycle would go. Heck, I have my first monitoring appointment Monday, and there is always the chance we won't even be able to do an ER. Or the ER could be a Saturday.

Stealing the intro from my first post... I got started on the family train a bit late at 39 with second hubby who isn't a lying piece of shit. Married October of 2015, timed intercourse until August 2016 before going to an RE. Diagnostics all came back quite good for my age, no concerns with DOR, AMH was in the 4's. Hubby's SA has low rapid and liner and morphology, but no actual diagnosis from the RE (never asked though). We did three cycles of IUI with 50mg Clomid Oct-Dec 2016 and response was pretty standard (2 dominate follicles, successful ovulation, good post wash SA numbers, etc).\n\nJanuary was our first freeze-all IVF cycle because I chose to include PGS.  I was on 300IU (then 375) Gonal-F with 75 units Menopur.  Cetrotide was added in to prevent ovulation part way through.  Lupron trigger.  14 AFC at baseline, 11 retrieved, 9 mature, 9 fertilized, 9 at Day 3, 2 frozen at Day 5 and 2 frozen at Day 6.  Overall it went relatively textbook and the result is one PGS normal embryo in storage.  After learning from folks here I asked my RE about doing a couple banking cycles before starting any transfers figuring that at 40 every month literally would make a difference in quality.  She was on board.  So I'm starting my second back-to-back retrieval round now.  I plan to tap out after three and then start doing transfers.\n\nI'm pretty open about our situation, but don't have any friends that have actually gone through it. I work in a male dominated field so several of them have wives that have gone through it, but not much first hand experience.  My husband is a bit indifferent on kids.  He knew it was something important to me and it used to be important to him, but now he feels like he has made it this far with out them so if it doesn't happen he is neutral on it.  I have really good insurance which includes fertility coverage, but I'm paying a good chunk out of my own pocket too.  Hubby isn't unsupportive (he does all my injections for me), but it sometimes feels very isolating and overwhelming.  In addition to IVF treatments I work full-time as a manager in technology and I go to school part-time \"just for fun\".", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1488493889, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "defmerc", "link_id": "t3_5x2817", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5x2817", "reply_delay": 48559, "retrieved_on": 1491156044, "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "helpplease187", "author_created_utc": 1482438740, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_13s6pb", "body": "You're awesome.

I have struggled to figure out when I would fit in this community after having participated in TTCafterloss for almost a year. I've struggled to figure out if I belong here, as evidenced by months of lurking and leaving up this tab for the last 6 hours. I see an RE for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss and unexplained infertility. We are (hopefully) about to start our third medicated cycle and are increasingly considered moving towards IVF. \n\nThe summary of my journey is that we started to TTC in July of 2014, right after I got the all clear from a thyroid cancer scare. I conceived in February 2015, found out I had an MMC at 10w in April, had a D&amp;C. Had a rough go of it after the D&amp;C due to retained products, but am stubborn and did not want a second one. Started to see an RE in February 2016, then conceived that March. I found out the pregnancy was not viable based on low-rising HCG very early on, however, growth continued and we even saw a heartbeat, but it was gone at 8w. This MC happened on its own at home. We then did the RPL panel, no abnormal results were found. More recently, after struggling to conceive on our own again, we started medicated cycles. I over responded to Clomid and produced 7 follicles, which then all turned into cysts. Got benched for a while and used birth control to suppress them. Had a better response to Letrozole last month with 2 follicles, got another negative test and am waiting to see if they also turned into cysts or not. \n\nLike the subreddit description says, more and more I feel like everyone is pregnant but me. I am finishing grad school and the other 5 women in my cohort conceived just when they wanted to, graduated, got jobs and moved on. Meanwhile, I was at home having my second miscarriage on the very same day I would have graduated with them, and struggles with anxiety and depression have delayed when I will finish by over a year. And that's just one area of my life, nevermind other friends (although I'm blissfully not on Facebook anymore), neighbors, celebrities, etc. Even among friends who started TTC after me and went straight to IVF for various reasons, I'm the last man standing. And I've started to notice that on the TTCafterloss group, which I have benefited from greatly, I struggle as I see far more names I recognize in the alumni thread than the TTC thread (I know there are some others here with similar experiences).", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1488502709, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1488502988, "gilded": 0, "id": "deftoin", "link_id": "t3_5x2817", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5x2817", "reply_delay": 57379, "retrieved_on": 1491159736, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "body": "It seems you've used a word or acronym that members of this community prefer to avoid.
