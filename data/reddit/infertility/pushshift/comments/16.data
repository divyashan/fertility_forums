I even went to the gym that evening. No big deal at all; it was the same for the removal.\n\n* MY HSG was also a non-event for me eventhough the person who performed the test said \"you have the tiniest cervix I've ever seen\" Uhhhh, thanks?\n\n* I had a lap in September to remove an endometrioma, endometriosis and adhesions. I had no classic endo-pain whatsoever. During my post-op when I told my Dr I only took one of the pain pills he prescribed me, he was floored! He was further floored that I hadn't been in severe pain during my period because of all of the endo. \n\n* Brazilian waxes don't really hurt too bad either.\n\nSo, I think it really just depends on the individual.

So, we decided that if this cycle is a bust, we're taking time off until after our birthdays in February. Maybe, if you're sour now, it's just time for a break?

It's up to you and your marriage how long y'all want to try.  \n\nI agree with the other's that infertility takes the sparkle out of the whole damn process.
