Also, another thing to keep in mind is that one individual data point can be so misleading - a low temp can be low for any number of reasons, in an otherwise perfect looking luteal phase. \n\nThe reason we continue is that my wife is irregular and has PCOS and it is helping confirm that ovulation did in fact take place since we can't rely on other signs such as fertile CM to pinpoint ovulation.\n\nGood on you for not being completely bitter.
