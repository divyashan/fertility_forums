It happens in so many areas of life and it's such bullshit. The mentality that good things happen to deserving people and if bad things happen you somehow did something to deserve it or more charitably, are just temporarily unlucky. It totally misses the point that terrible and random things happen all the time for no particular reason, and what's more, certain populations are even more vulnerable because some bad things aren't random because we live in a society that makes life harder for many groups of people. That those people don't excel is not a testament to their lack of faith, or negative thought patterns. It's not even a sign of less resiliency. It's a sign that shit is really fucking hard for some people. That's systematic, and doesn't have a damn thing to do with the individual.\n\nI wandered from infertility, but how society assigns blame has parallells. People want to place order on my infertility all the fucking time. And you can substitute the word order with the word blame, because that's what it is. People want to find the reason because it gives them something to lean on, proof that the world isn't full of random terrible occurrences, and assurance that if they avoid the pitfalls that caused your troubles they can avoid troubles themselves. People want to be assured that the struggles my husband and I have been through with infertility is due to chemo I had when I was younger, because it puts their mind at ease that they'll never have the same problems because they never had chemo. I feel like my fucking mom wanted it to be the chemo causing our troubles, and the only explanation I have for that one is that she couldn't handle the chaos of it just being fucking bad luck, just like getting cancer at 18 was really shitty luck and not a function of anything terrible that I did to deserve it. Somehow that's slightly easier for us to accept, because we have an easier time accepting that a child is not deserving of terrible things. It's much easier to say innocent adults deserve awful things, I guess.\n\neta: and I think we do it to ourselves, too. There are a very small handful of supplements that have proven to be helpful with infertility, and yet so many people bend over backward at some point in treatment thinking that if they just add purple fink berry to their list of crazy pills they'll get the free sex baby.
