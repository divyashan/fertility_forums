It's my second and my clinic also does mild sedation. \n\nI showered the morning off, and washed my hair, and it was fine.  My clinic specified no perfumes/fragrances, but said soap was okay.  The big thing was no eating/drinking after midnight.  I was glad I showered and washed my hair because I didn't feel up to it again until the night of the following day.  \n\nMild sedation for me was a bit rough.  The good news though, is that it's a relatively quick procedure.  It was a bit shocking for me because a nurse had told me I wouldn't feel anything/remember anything and when I got to the retrieval and was lying there waiting for it to start, the anesthesiologist seemed surprised that I had been told that and said, yes, I actually would feel it, though it would be just a pinching sensation.  For me, it was more painful than that, but I am very sensitive to pain.  I wish someone had told me before hand that it could be that way, rather than minutes before the procedure began.  There should be an anesthesiologist with you, and they will be talking to you and monitoring your pain and adjusting the medication accordingly.  In many ways, the worst part for me was the nausea, but in addition to pain meds, they should have anti-nausea meds on hand, so if that's an issue for you, just tell them.  \n\nI just sent someone else a few other tips, and I will paste them here (#2 is specific to my clinic - a lot of clinics will have something effervescent on hand.  If in doubt though, I say bring your own.)  Best of luck to you!  Just know it's fast and make sure you take care of yourself and rest afterwards.  I'll be thinking of you as I'm recovering from the the same thing!\n\n1.  Get some Miralax and have some the night of retrieval! Believe me, constipation after retrieval blows. :(\n\n2.  Bring some ginger-ale or Sprite and some saltines with you, especially if you tend to get nauseous. I had some in the car for the drive home (which I was grateful for), but I expected them to have something like that on hand and they didn't. I was very sick to my stomach and finally someone dug up some flat Sprite from the bottom of some old two liter, which helped, but this time I'm bringing my own.\n  \n3.  Have some very basic noodle soup or something on hand. I made some easy matzo ball soup and it was the best thing I'd ever eaten post-retrieval nap. I really craved the salt, I think.\n\n4. Take pain meds when you get home before you fall asleep. I got in bed immediately upon getting home, but was woken two hours later by my throbbing ovaries. If I had gotten ahead of the pain, I think I would have done a lot better.\n\n5.  Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Water, gatorade, electrolytes in whatever form.
