If your clinic does genetic screening (PGS or PGD) it's possible that he works in that lab, and might not have much contact with the actual embryology lab.  \nThe lab might be set up in a couple of ways: (1) individual embryologists follow through on each case (so the same person will do your egg retrieval, fertilisation, fertilisation/embryo checks and embryo transfer. (2) The embryologists work on a rotation, so one person will do all the egg retrievals one day and another will do all the fertilisations and so on. This is the more likely scenario as it is more efficient.  \nIf the case is (2) then it is likely that several embryologists will be handling your case throughout your cycle and will be looking at your case file. You should voice your concerns to your RE and ask him to talk to the lead embryologist. Perhaps they could make sure that he's not assigned to your case and will instead be on different rotations (so that, for example, he'll be doing fertilisation checks and embryo transfers when you're coming in for your egg retrieval. I would also insist that he won't be the one informing you on your egg retrieval results or on the development of your embryos.  \nIt really depends on your clinic if they'll be willing to do this, but it's worth asking. You don't even have to tell them he's your ex, just say that he's someone you know and would rather not want to know the details of your case.  \nHaving said that (and of course I don't know your ex's character at all) he's a professional and has likely signed a confidentiality agreement, meaning that he won't be able to talk to people outside the clinic about the cases he deals with. So if he does see your case notes, you shouldn't have to worry that he will talk to you or anybody else about them, but I do understand that just him seeing them makes you uncomfortable.  \nBest of luck, I'm sure your clinic will take your concerns into account.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1459683317, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1459683531, "gilded": 0, "id": "d1nz4rn", "link_id": "t3_4d5sg7", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_4d5sg7", "reply_delay": 2035, "retrieved_on": 1463186430, "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "NeedANap1116", "author_created_utc": 1408474534, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "IVF #1, MFI & rogue ninja ovary", "author_fullname": "t2_hyc2k", "body": "That is, in fact, exactly what I was thinking...", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1459683356, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "d1nz55d", "link_id": "t3_4d0yuo", "nest_level": 5, "parent_id": "t1_d1nc291", "reply_delay": 54108, "retrieved_on": 1463186435, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "squirrelgirl22", "author_created_utc": 1357510535, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Severe MFI for him / Lean PCOS for me", "author_fullname": "t2_a4kpo", "body": "I had a similar issue with my clinic.

And... she went mention that the cousin will be in court, just that, no details of nothing, his dad went all cold and that we should not talk about that.\nWhy the fuck not? The dad never said anything to her, not even I support you, i'm there for you. Just nothing all at on the whole subject.\n\nSo, yesterday, after we come home, we had a big conversation. Told him that I was on the edge of leaving him as fucking hell, he never ever wanted to talk about the infertility shit, and I'm stuck with all the needles and the hormones that I don't need as I'm fine, and i'm doing that for him and yesh, I will answer questions about the FET from his MIL as she is lovely and been very supportive and even wanted to drive me to the clinic, which is 3 h away. That his attitude was rude, and the whole NONE SHALL TALK I can't stand it anymore. That I am very disappointed that his dad can't even support his wife. Even my MIL thought me that she would not have been able t be with FIL when she was younger, it should not have work, he is too stuck up. So..... That i enver even bring the subject of the infertility and all. I respect that he don'T want to talk about it, but a fucking fuss about questions about the FET? Is lot like it was about him firing blank or something. She was just interesting in knowing about the injections and all.\n\nBig talk.  \n\nHe finally apologized.
