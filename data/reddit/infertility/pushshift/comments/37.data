Mine was a bit like that too - I remember asking if he thought a second cycle would be necessary and he told me at the time that my case was very 'vanilla' and he didn't think we'd be back.  Here we are on IVF#3.\n\nThat being said, if you decide on doing a frozen, you don't have to make any rushed decisions and you can decide on a plan after you have more information (like how many embryos are frozen and what quality they are).  That probably doesn't help if you are trying to decide right now whether to go for a fresh.  This is a tough decision!\n\nSomething to think about might be whether you would ideally want &gt;1 kid.  You may have enough embryos to get you 1 pregnancy, but if you think you want more, your eggs will be a few years older by the time you're back.  That factored into our decision to do more egg retrievals despite the fact that we do have a normal embryo waiting to be transferred.  Then again, we are a few years older than you, so you may be more willing to see if you can work with the embryos you do have and financially it may be easier to spread procedures out over a few years.\n\nYou may also want to ask how good a candidate you are for a fresh transfer.  My progesterone level during stims got higher than my RE liked to see, which would have resulted in reduced success.  So the frozen route was our only option anyhow.\n\nThese aren't easy decisions.  Maybe you can ask your RE for a longer phone call or visit to talk about the pros/cons of fresh vs. frozen?  There is no 'right' answer, just what's right for you and your husband.

It can be overwhelming at first, but you will get through it!  I'm in healthcare, so needles/injections are part of my normal job, but boy is it different when you're doing it to yourself.  It will get easier as you go.\n\nDown regulation refers to the part of the cycle you're on lupron but not follistim yet.  During this part of the cycle, you are basically shutting down your own pituitary hormones so that your ovaries stay inactive.  It allows the follistim (FSH) to work on all the follicles together so you get multiple follicles/eggs developing together at roughly the same rate.\n\nI think most places don't do a lot of monitoring during the first week of stims because it takes about a week for the follicles to get going.  I had bloodwork on day 5, but no ultrasound until day 8 of stims.  I think most people are on stims for ~8-12 days.  Your clinic probably means the 6th would be the earliest you would trigger, with egg retrieval 36h later.\n\nIf you have concerns, you should be able to ask your nurse.  So much of this process goes better when you trust your clinic, so it's important that they are giving you the information you need to feel confident in the process.\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1486693714, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "ddk3xsw", "link_id": "t3_5sz5nx", "nest_level": 4, "parent_id": "t1_ddk1f7o", "reply_delay": 3362, "retrieved_on": 1488723581, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "TheHearts", "author_created_utc": 1421926566, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "34, DOR, RPL/stillbirth, FET#2", "author_fullname": "t2_kvj9o", "body": "Nobody attacked her.
