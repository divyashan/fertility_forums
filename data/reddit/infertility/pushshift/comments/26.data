My husband had cancer when he was younger so we knew we might have problems before we even got married and started trying. It's still hard obviously, but it was good that we had a lot of time to talk about some of the what-ifs and come to terms with having to do more work to get pregnant than the average couple before we were thrown in the middle of it. That being said, you don't have to decide now if you want children, but I agree that keeping the conversation open with you partner is a good step. I think someone else in the thread talked about some basic tests you can get to assess your fertility so I won't repeat all that. If you are in the US and have health insurance, talk with your OB about how to code/bill for them and insurance might cover most of the basic testing. Of course even if all the tests come back normal it doesn't guarantee you will have no problems, but it might be reassuring to know whether there is/isn't a major issue. I also second what someone else said about don't assume you are infertile and use that as a method of birth control if you are not ready for kids yet. We have all heard those \"miracle\" stories about couples who tried forever and gave up and then ended up pregnant. Even if something is off and it is difficult for you to get pregnant, it may not be impossible so use some kind of birth control until you are ready to try. Good luck with everything.

People process shit in weird ways. I'm not sure how long this has been going on, but it's possible she's processing it in a different way (maybe she blames herself and is taking it out on you instead). \n\nFor example, I'm pretty sure all my mother heard was, \"We want a babies\" when we told them IVF was our only option. So, although she acknowledges we have to do IVF, she talks A LOT about how I should keep things for our kids and how I'll understand (apparently everything) when I have kids. It's not helpful or appropriate. \n\nFor us, I was too polite to say anything to my mother, so my husband finally said something when they were alone in the car together. She never mentioned the conversation to me (I think she was embarrassed), but her behavior has improved. However, in your situation, it might be better if your husband spoke up and defended you (although it sounds like he's already doing this). If that's the case, then I'd hope her behavior would improve over time as she processes it more.\n\nAs for the god parent thing. I'd try not to take it personally. As someone who also grew up Catholic, but since renounced (forced to do confirmation against my will, and nearly coerced into a Catholic wedding), and a god parent for my first nephew, it might be better not to be the god parent. I was completely excluded from his first communion and not allowed to buy him his first bible etc. So it hurts twice, once for being excluded and once for thinking I actually had a right to be included. For the record, when I was asked to be the god mother, I made sure they knew I wasn't a Catholic believer before I agreed.\n\nSorry again for being in this shitty situation and having people in your life who make it harder than this has to be.

Asked us if we were thinking of children and said we should consider not having any because of my mental illness.

We decided for me to go NC with her and I don't regret it one bit because she hasn't changed. She still blames me for anything she doesn't approve of (just told me to stop baking again last week) and is not supportive when I could use supportive (said she didn't care when we told her about IVF and offered zero sympathy when I got laid off.

I tell my husband everything unless it is something that has nothing to do with him and is clearly meant to be a secret. But clearly this conversation that your MIL had with your husband does not fall into that category and I am amazed that she thought you two wouldn't discuss it. She is so out of line here, clearly not thinking rationally and unreasonably putting her emotions on your shoulders. Well I say screw her, excuse me but she has no right to make you or your husband feel bad in this situation and I think you are well within your rights to tell her so. If, like me, you are non-confrontational in person (despite having prolonged imaginary arguments with people in your head) and don't want to just ring her up and give her a piece of your mind, then I suggest you take one of two courses of action. Firstly, the mature way - call her and ask whether the two of you (or even better the three of you, including your husband so you outnumber her and have his support) could meet for morning or afternoon tea (something short that can end quickly if needed but has distractions in the form of food/tea being served) and just talk it all through with her. Write a list of the concerns you've raised in your post above, taking out the emotion where possible, and discuss with your husband which ones you are willing to overlook and which ones are really offensive to you (like the godparent thing - ludicrous), and then calmly talk through them and explain to her how she made you feel. Awkward but will probably lead to resolution of the problem if you all actually listen to each other. The second and considerably less mature option is just to freeze her out for a while - drop contact, act cold, harbour resentment and grumble about her to your husband. Personally I am less mature when it comes to in laws, and would be tempted to go for that route, but each to their own. I am sorry you are going through this. I hope you can find a calm and peaceful resolution to it all once things blow over a little.
