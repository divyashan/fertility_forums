Before we started saving, we paid off all of our debt by selling his car while he was deployed to Afghanistan and using his combat pay and my great income at the time. Once we were out of debt, we managed to save -almost 5000$..then of course we ran into me needing a 3600$ dental procedure that was absolutely necessary so we started back at square one with 1300$ left and a cross-country move that luckily, was paid for by the military. Since February this year, I started sculpting jewelry and selling it to bring in extra income while we go through my lap surgery, hysteroscopy, and all the pre-IVF rounds that would make it damn near impossible to find full-time work right away. Once I \"came out\" about our infertility of three years and announced my little business venture, many people wanted to gift us whatever they could. So far I've made 1500$ from jewelry sales and we have been given 2500$ through various extremely generous friends and family. My mom and dad have also told us that they want to help but are still discussing the amount of help they can give. \n\nHonestly, the response has been overwhelming. Many times, my breath was taken away and I cried like a baby when we were given help. It was really, really unexpected. It feels weird to be handed money for a procedure that isn't guaranteed to work. I actually fought myself for weeks about giving all of the money back and quitting. It felt like people would be disappointed and feel like they wasted their hard earned money if we didn't get a baby out of IVF. But the gifts have allowed us to say that we will try FETs and a second fresh cycle if necessary since our original plan was to put all of it on our credit card (which has a 14,000$ limit and is empty). So the plan now is to pay as much as possible with our savings and put the rest on the card. We anticipate having 6000$ toward the 8000$ IVF (Meds and monitoring included, thanks to the lovely research hospital and their low-cost IVF for self-payers). If the first one doesn't work we will do all FETs possible from any frozen embryos we get. If no frozen embryos, we will most likely wait until tax returns in March/April 2016 to pay off the remaining debt and finance the next cycle. \n\n\nEDIT: We are also renting to save money because we will not purchase a house until we are otherwise debt free. Infertility put buying a house on hold until we are on the other side of this- whether that means we move on or have a baby. \n\nSECOND EDIT: Tricare military insurance pays for diagnostics and some treatment (including my lap and hysteroscopy for septum) but will not cover any ART procedures other than timed intercourse with injectibles. Since I have endo and a septum and my husband has severe MFI, our only option is IVF/ICSI.
