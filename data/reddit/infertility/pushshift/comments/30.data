I've got to do a big work trip in November.  Our doctor originally wanted to do a round in October-November, but revised his suggestions out to the three that you put forward when he found out about the trip.  We went with option 3 - skip this cycle.  We had a lot of reasons for that:\n\nThe abridged version:\n\n1) flying after first round of meds? Doable, but not a fantastic idea, particularly if I'll be somewhere where my doctor can't help us out if something goes wrong.\n\n2) I've been working on the stuff for this trip for three years.  I could do it pregnant, but I don't want to run the risk of messing any medication up when the stakes are this high.\n\n4) I get the \"there will always be a reason\" thought process.  But this isn't a standard reason for delaying - it's a trip I've put years of work into. \n\n5) Jet lag + flying + time differences = confusion. I know I'd mess something up, get confused about the dosage even if it was written down perfectly, or mess something else up.  And that's *before* I throw work trip mayhem into the equation. \n\nWe ended up deciding to hold off for a month.  It was actually a really good decision.  It gave us extra time to breathe and focus on the process.  It'll be a whirlwind soon.  That decision took a whole layer off of our stress.  It was right for us, that doesn't mean it would be right for anyone else. \n\nGood luck!", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1474093809, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "d7qalh8", "link_id": "t3_533jap", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_533jap", "reply_delay": 41052, "retrieved_on": 1475761352, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "trixylix", "author_created_utc": 1409250512, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_i3e3v", "body": "Menopause is not the only reason a woman isn't ovulating...  the medication involved with IVF will hopefully support your body in creating a larger number of good sized follicles which are then retrieved surgically before being fertilised and ultimately transferred back...

Sounds like it will all work out ok. Here's a story about me almost completely screwing up my egg retrieval though, just to make you feel less alone!\n\nSo, for my second IVF cycle, they were worried about OHSS, I think, because I had around 30 follicles. So they told me that I should come in to the hospital to get the trigger shot before my retrieval, so a nurse could give it to me. I had to get the triggger shot at 10 pm, when the fertility clinic was closed, so they set up an appointment for me in the Labor&amp;Delivery department, which is always open I imagine.\n\nThey had already given me a prescription for the pregnyl trigger, so I had it sitting in my refrigerator, but in my whole life, I've never had to bring medicine to the doctor in order to get a shot. They always have the medicine there, right? So it didn't even occur to me to bring it, and the nurse at the clinic forgot to mention it, or just assumed I understood.\n\nAnyway, I showed up at Labor&amp;Delivery at 9:45 pm and the first thing the nurse there said to me was, \"Good evening!\" and the second thing was, \"Do you have the medicine and dosage information with you?\" Turns out that the Labor&amp;Delivery department doesn't keep pregnyl in stock (which makes sense, why would they need it?). So they couldn't give me the shot without the medicine that was sitting at home in my fridge.\n\nI called my husband in panic and since we live sort of close to the hospital and we don't have a car and the buses weren't running regularly that late in the evening, he put the medicine in a container with two bags of frozen peas and ran the 2.5 kilometers to the hospital.\n\nI ended up getting the trigger shot 15 minutes late and my egg retrieval went just fine a day and a half later.

I thought this thread might be a way to gauge if this sub is somewhere I might belong. I'm 32, have been TTC for 13 months now, and have had two losses. Both were early, and the second was a complicated rollercoaster that has resulted in me needing to wait to try for a bit. I've been doing test after test since April of this year and most of June, July and August have been spent getting blood taken or at other doc appointments. My HSG this week revealed a polyp and possible peritubal adhesions. \n\nI'm a daily poster in r/TTCAL and they are my tribe. But week after week my buddies move on to the alumni pregnancy thread and it takes its toll. When I've searched for information about procedures and how I'm feeling about TTC, the most relevant material pops up from this sub. While I believe miscarriage changes ones life and the TTC process inexplicably, for me, I'm having a harder time with the \"but I'm still not pregnant\" part versus the \"I was pregnant and I'm not now\" part. \n\nEvery time I've turned a corner and felt like the open road was ahead of me to try, something new pops up to knock me back down. I'm sure we have all (naively) had those \"OMG I hope I never have to go that route to have a baby\" thoughts or \"I would just die if that happened to me\" thoughts. As time goes on, more and more of those things have happened to me. And I need to accept its a possibility that I may have to take alternate routes to have a baby. And if so, I would survive. I've read things here that are so instantly comforting and uplifting. I'm looking for a place where I can come to terms with the fact that TTC and getting pregnant will not be the glamorous journey of sunshine, rainbows and unicorns that I've made it out to be all my life - and if not - it's *okay*.
