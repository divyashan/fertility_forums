It looks like lots of us here have supportive and optimistic partners, which is great!  But I'm also kind of struggling with my partner's optimism at times, and I don't know how to respond to it when I'm feeling sad.  \n\nI think the biggest issue is that my partner isn't experiencing the things that I am in my body.  We have had one miscarriage, one ectopic, and now our first fresh ICSI failed.  For him, the pregnancies were never quite real and the devastation that I've felt in my heart he just can't grasp.  And of course the physical reminders and processes of pregnancy loss which are painful and gory.  I know it hurts him and I know it hurts him to see my suffering, but it also upsets him.  He will be supportive and hug me and dry my tears, and knows when to be serious vs when to make me laugh.  He spoils me my doing all of the dumb things I want to do when I can't cope with anything else, and I am so grateful for that.  But at the same time, when I burst into tears and say I just can't handle anymore he says something like \"We just need to be positive and keep taking these steps.\"  Our infertility coincides with a lot of other life changes for us so it's been extra hard and we're really leaning heavily on each other for support, but I can tell he feels frustrated that I'm not a bit more chin-up about things.  \n\nI know from my previous losses that I will move on from this, and I'll be able to peel myself of off the couch soon, but I don't know how to cope with my partner's positivity.  He seems satisfied that we have more chances with frozen embryos but I'm *UN*satisfied because nothing is a guarantee of a take-home baby. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm just rambling here or if anyone knows what I mean?  I want to be able to support him and let him grieve, too, however he does that best, but I also want to reality check him that we've now had three failures and just moving down the line is no guarantee of success.  I guess I should add I don't feel like he is asking/telling me to \"move on\" or \"get over it\" or anything like that, and I am completely aware that I am lucky to have such a supportive partner.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Supporting and being supported by an optimistic partner after another failure?

Everyone here always says RE, RE, RE! but in this case - regular gyno seems like it might work better.\n\nShe's redrawn all the initial bloodwork that my RE did 2 years ago, and I'm going back for CD21 labs on Monday just to see if somehow I've miraculously started ovulating on my own.  She also listened to *all* my symptoms and agrees that it does sound suspiciously like endo, so she's going to check with my insurance about covering a lap - which she's coding as for pain (which is actually true) instead of for infertility (even though it's that too).  She also suggested that if my testosterone comes back high (which I'm sure it will) she may put me on spironolactone or something like that along with BC for 3 months to try to lower that.  This is sounding a lot more reasonable than \"take all these expensive fertility drugs and do IUI even though we have no idea if there's an implantation issue or not because we've decided the only thing is PCOS\".  I told the doc that January would be the best bet for a surgery - the wedding is in March after all, and I've no idea what my insurance situation will look like after that!

He was really nice, very calming, professional and answered all our (probably mostly stupid) questions with patience and understanding. We were told with our mild MFI that we should start with four IUI cycles before considering moving on to IVF. He also diagnosed me with mild PCOS, a huge surprise to me! This was mostly due to my irregular cycle lengths, bit of acne I've dealt with since getting my period at 14 and the transvaginal ultrasound which showed multiple small follicles along with 2 large, normal ones. With that new information I was also given a prescription for letrozole to use in conjunction with the IUI's. I feel so relieved to have this information and a solid step forward! I'm aware of the less than stellar odds that are associated with IUI's but it still is great to be doing something other than crossing our fingers each month. I get to start next cycle so I've never wanted to get my period so badly before. Very, very excited to get started and move through the steps.

Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting relies on voluntarily annual reports by more than 90% of US in vitro fertilization centers. We evaluated pregnancy and live birth rates in donor oocyte-recipient cycles after the first embryo transfer with day 5/6 embryos. Statistical models, adjusted for patient and donor ages, number of embryos transferred, race, infertility diagnosis, and cycle year were created to compare live birth rates in 392 preimplantation genetic screening and 20,616 control cycles.\n\nResults\n\nOverall, pregnancy and live birth rates were significantly lower in preimplantation genetic screening cycles than in control cycles. Adjusted odds of live birth for preimplantation genetic screening cycles were reduced by 35% (odds ratio, 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.53\u20130.80; P &lt; .001).\nConclusion\n\nPreimplantation genetic screening, as practiced in donor oocyte-recipient cycles over the past 9 years, has not been associated with improved odds of live birth or reduction in miscarriage rates.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Wednesday Topic: DE", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/72wox2/journal_club_wednesday_topic_de/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "learning_hillzz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "28, DOR, IVF#1, FET in Oct.

She wanted to come and while I appreciate the gesture and it was fun for the most part, I ended sort of regretting her being there or even knowing about our infertiltiy. \n\nA side note, we aren't emotionally close, though our family is somewhat \"tight knit.\" I won't get into the details but she was abusive my entire life and still has episodes of being a total emotionally/verbally abusive hag followed by being pretty cool and fun. Oddly, the more frequently I hang out with her, the more infractions I seem to make that are saved up and usually hjurled at me later in some fight she picks with me. To be fair, she probably feels self conscious because the more time I spend with her, the more she annoys me. \n\nI think I was feeling really vulnerable awhile back and just looking for support anywhere I could get it because this infertiltiy shit is horribly lonely. It's a weird conditioned response that overrides logic. My instincts tell me to go to my mom because that's comfort, but my intellect slaps me later and reminds me she has never really been supportive of me. \n\nShe started out being pretty supportive and encouraging about the infertility  but she isn't good with feelings and I think she can't handle my anger and hurt over it. I'm definitely in the anger phase of my grief right now. This past week she has said so many clueless and insensitive things. Some gems:\n\n\" Not being able to have a baby isn't the same as dying,\" when I told her about the studies saying infertiltiy stress impacts people similar to chemo or HIV. \n\n\" You did know something was wrong, I told you to get checked out when you were younger.\" When I mentioned how frustrating it was to find out about our infertility now, when we could have been saving up for IVF all this time. I replied that I did get checked out when I was younger but I wasn't trying to get pregnant and I did what they recommended (go off birth controll at least 1 year before trying). I also told her that me and my endo are not the only contributing factors to our infertility which I immediately felt guilty about.\n\n\"In a way, you did know something was wrong, didn't you\" in response to my shock last year that I had a huge ovarian cyst, needed my ovary removed, and that endo was discovered during the surgery. Again I feel like she s blaming me for not knowing these things. \n\n-Going on and on about how her pregnancy and delivery at age 44 with her youngest was so easy and smooth AT THE INFERTILITY walk. \n\n-Telling me to be careful about saying I'm infertile because I don't know yet if I am. I think she s confusing infertility with not being able to conceive via ART. \n\n-Telling me to be more understanding of my sister and her boyfriend because someday when we have kids, we'll expect understanding. This was on a road trip when I playfully told my husband to wait to take off to make sure my sister's \"kid mobile\" was ready to head off. That comment particularly pissed me off because I was super helpful and accomdating to my sister and her kids and entertained them all weekend whereas everyone else expected them to be little adults. \n\nI honestly kind of dread my mom being a grandma to my kid. She's so far up my sister and her son's butt and I probably sound crazy, but since I'm her least favorite child, my kid will probably be too. \n\nSorry for the rant. I'm PMSing.  I would never bother talking to my mom about any of this because whenever I try it starts World War 3. She doesn't do feelings well and then just lashes out at me. I will probably just stop sharing with her about any of this.

Decided to get a semen analysis to get a baseline for fertility, although didn't do the test until about 3 weeks into treatment.\n\n**Results:**   \n* Volume: 1.5 (reference range: 1.5 - 5.0 ml)  \n* Viscosity: Semi-gelatinous, semen does not form normal discrete droplets.  \n* Sperm motility: 20 (reference range: greater than 50%) **flagged as abnormal**  \n* Sperm count: 153 (reference range: greater than 20 x 10E6/ml)  \n* Abnormal sperm: 60 (reference range: less than 40%)  \n\n**Lab comments:**  \nMorphology: Variation in size of heads and or trails. Malformation of the acrosomal/postacrossomal region. Cytoplasmic extrusion mass.  \n\nInterpretation: An increased number of abnormal forms (&gt;40%) are noted. It is generally assumed that such aberrant spermatozoa are incapable of fertilization. The morphologic findings correlated with the low mortility. The findings of a large number of spermatozoa with a cytoplasmic extrusion mass could indicate epididymal disfunction. Recommendation is to repeat test.  \n\n**My thoughts:**  \nI have been recommended to a urologist and will take another semen analysis in the meantime. What is bothering me is just exactly how to interpret these results. Are they really that bad? Is the high abnormal sperm / motility of 20% that bad given that my sperm count appears to be pretty good?

I'm spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars on ovulation kits cause it might work one day right?? My body might surprise me and be normal one day. Right? Wrong. It never works. My cycles don't work, my ovaries don't work, and getting pregnant doesn't work.  I've had all the tests, had multiple meetings with my RE, had surgery and sonohysterograms and hysterograms. Nothing works. How am I ever supposed to get treatment when nothing works? I am on cycle day 44. And now my very wrong body is having ovulation symptoms. If ovulation symptoms are even a real thing. I'm starting to doubt they exist cause lord knows my body won't do anything right including having correct symptoms.  I have all the textbook signs of ovulation: increased CM, cramps, sore breasts. Yet the 39th ovulation kit (started on day 5 this time; so much for being positive helping with getting pregnant) is still a big fat no. I'm taking both regular and digital and they are both no. How am I ever supposed to have an IUI if I don't ovulate? How am I ever supposed to have an IUI if my body doesn't work right? I'm just so very tired. And I just love how my RE told me after the surgery and the 2nd sonohysterogram that now we should be able to try IUI. After 8 years of wondering, waiting, procrastinating, and finally starting treatment everything is as it should be. Our numbers are good, everything was corrected, there's no scar tissue.  IUI will be a good choice for us. Yet to do that my body has to work right. Which it doesn't.

We have been struggling with unexplained infertility for 2 years. I feel like I have absolutely no one to talk to about this huge looming issue in my life. I don't think my husband really understands. He tries his best to comfort me and knows I get upset about it but doesn't seem to really GET it. My married friends are all pregnant or have had their first child.. unexpectedly too. I honestly don't talk to them anymore. I just can't. My best friend is not married yet, and I don't want to burden her with this. I do not want my family to know, because they will pity me or cause me more misery by forcing me to try this and that.\n\nI had my consultation visit with an RE today. My OBGYN referred him to me. Afterward, I just sat on a bench outside and cried.\n\nThe visit went something like this:\n\n\"So why are you here?\"\n\n\"Um.. because my OBGYN referred me after 2 failed cycles of Clomid? She wanted me to try IUI.\"\n\n\"Okay, Clomid. Do you know what that does?\"\n\n\"It helps the egg to mature fully so you can ovulate?\"\n\n\"Clomid increases your chances of twins.\"\n\n\"Oh, uh.. okay..\"\n\n\"Have you checked your Fallopian tubes?\"\n\n\"Um.. I think so? I had an HSG done which showed no blockage.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's for your Fallopian tubes. It connects the ovaries to your uterus?\" He looked at me like I was stupid.\n\n\"Okay...\" (Fuck you.)\n\n\"Do you PMS?\"\n\n\"Well, I used to have mood swings, but not so much anymore.\"\n\n\"You don't get depressed when you start your period and find out you're not pregnant?\"\n\nAt this point, I started choking up and said through tears, \"I wouldn't call it depression, but there are good days and bad days.\"\n\nHe saw me and said, \"Oh, sorry.\" \n\nHe drew me a (messy) diagram about FSH and receptors in the brain and estrogen, and what Clomid does, and blah blah. My husband couldn't come with me because of work (I didn't mind this at all) and the RE said, \"You definitely want your husband here supporting you. Well, obviously, we'll need him for the sperm soon enough.\"\n\nI wanted to get up and leave. But instead, I stayed until the end of our short 8-minute talk, and he took me to a \"coordinator,\" who proceeded to tell me how great my insurance plan is (consultation is covered, IUI is covered, 3 rounds of IVF covered, blah blah). \n\nThey told me to call on Day 1 of my next period so they can start the IUI process. I am going to start my period this Saturday, and I really do not want to go back there. I was really looking forward to my RE visit because I've read so much positive feedback from people here about RE visits. I guess it's better to go than to not go and wonder...\n\nI am at a crossroads now. I could just suck it up and go back there since they have all my files. Or I could \"suffer\" through another cycle and try going somewhere else.

It's the first party that has happened in my social group in a long time.  My pregnant best friend and her husband were also invited to this party.  We haven't been communicating regularly since she announced her pregnancy, so I was waiting for her to ask if I was attending the party.  No message ever came.  I ultimately decided not to go for several reasons-- first, I just don't feel like being around a ton of people these days.  Next, this is the first social gathering since she announced her pregnancy, so I couldn't bear to be around everyone fawning over her.  And finally,  I'm currently in my TWW before we start treatment, and I didn't want to have to explain why I wasn't drinking to the whole party.\n\nI had made my peace with not going to the party, and my husband and I just decided to stay home and order takeout.  I'm eating my food having a nice night when I get a text from her husband asking me for the address to the party.  I immediately lost it.  I don't understand why, when I haven't said a word to him in almost 3 months, he would ask me of all people.  He had sent me a few texts earlier in the week that I had ignored, so I took a breath and texted back something along the lines of \"why would you ask me of all people?  I get that you've been trying to make nice with me but I'm not ready and I'm not ok.  I'm not going to the party\".  He texted back something along the lines of \"I wasn't.  Thanks for the help.\"  I immediately burst into tears and sobbed for most of the night.  As sensitive as I am these days, I felt attacked.  I didn't want a painful reminder that even going out and having a good time with my friends has to be a huge decision and sucks up most of my energy.  It just hurts so much because I know that the world is still spinning for everyone else, but I feel like it has stopped for me.  I used to love going out, going to parties and being social, but I barely can find the courage to leave my house these days.  \n\nAs I continue this painful road,  I really don't know how to take my relationships with any of my friends.  At first,  I think I had expectations that they would want to know more about what's going on with me,  but even though I've basically dropped off the face of the earth, check ins are few and far between.  I don't know what I'm supposed to expect though or how to feel supported.  I don't want to create a narrative of assumptions and I'm trying so hard to not do that.  I don't know what's going to happen once I finally come to terms with IF and find a better way to cope with this depression.  It's hard.  I wished that I could be my happy, social self more than anything yesterday, but instead I sat on my couch waiting for my period to show it's ugly face.

When I started out researching adoption, I was not well informed on the importance of open adoption. Now, it will be our preference, knowing the implications it has on not only our adopted child's well being and sense of self, but the well being of the biological/first parents. I will never forget when my adopted best friend told me she was adopted and pulled out a box from her closet when we were in 8th grade and showed me the things her parents gave her.( At age 4 through foster care  because of neglect) and how emotional it was for her. The research has pointed to being honest with adopted children from the start and letting them know they were not \"unwanted\" by their parents, but loved enough to be given a safer chance, and becoming a daily dream come true for their adoptive parents.

I've been lurking a while looking for answers and thought I should just post instead :P My wife and I (both 30yo) thought it would be easy to have children. No history of infertility on either side so things should've been ok. Here we are after 2 years of constant failures, with one year of tests, IUIs and hormones. The diagnosis : unexplained infertility. \n\nMy numbers seem pretty decent (morphology at 2%, but doctors said considering the other numbers, it shouldn't be an obstacle) and everything is fine on my wife's end too so far. However, this is really taking a toll on us individually and as a couple. \n\nMy wife has been on a sick leave from work for around 5 months now, leaving me as the sole provider (she does get some sort of workers comp. though). Seeing all her coworkers get pregnant really took it out of her. She is on medication (a type of anti depressant) that doesn't seem to help at all, but it does prevent her from sleeping. So she now also takes sleeping pills, which makes her groggy for most of the day. All meds are approved for couples that are trying to concieve of course. This usually means that when I get home, I make dinner, do the dishes and other house hold chores because she also gets really dizzy from the meds. \n\nTo top it all off, I work at a place I can barely stand anymore, just so we can have the money to keep going with fertility procedures and pay our mortgage. Speaking of which, she has a laparoscopy planned in a few weeks and she is scared to death about it. Has anyone here ever undergone this procedure and has any input/advice?\n\nSorry about the venting. It's just really fruatrating and today is also the official 2 years of infertility day, so the weekend was really rough for us. Anyway, to everyone who took the time to read and/or respond, thanks.

I awoke again much later, back in day surgery, still no partner by my side. I was traumatised and upset. A woman appeared with my clothes, told me to get dressed and come take a seat in a chair down the front. Post-op I have very little voice (turns out I almost developed pneumonia) and called and called for her to ring my partner. \n\n\"Yep will do sweets!\" \n\nGot dressed and dragged my sore, aching body to a chair, reclined it, put my feet up and expected a nurse/doc to come by and give me a run down of what happened. \n\nNothing. No one. \n\nI again tried four or five times to get someone's attention to ring my partner (I was in no state to do it myself, I could barely keep my eyelids open). Finally they ring him. He arrives, they give me a sandwich and a drink and send me home. \n\nThat's it. No paper work. No doctor visit. Nothing. \n\nStill completely out of it, they get me to the car, and  my partner helps me get in. On the way home he starts to question what happened as he had been given the run around all day and was told I'd been in surgery for 3 hours longer than I was. He'd been expecting something worst case. He asks if anyone told me anything, \n'no, not that I remember and they wouldn't come see me in recovery right? They took me out of there before I was even properly awake!' \n\nThey discharged  me before even telling me a damn THING that happened in my surgery. Before my specialist had even been to see me. \n\nWhile sleeping at home, I missed a phone call. It was my surgeon/IF specialist! He left a voicemail, sounding very displeased that I had been discharged before seeing him, but more importantly, he informed me that my RHS tube was not salvageable, it was removed. He also discovered that my LHS had been blocked and he had removed the blockage, cleared it out and fixed her up. \n\nSo the past two years of infertility have a cause. They're no longer unexplained. I thought I would cry if they removed my RHS tube, but I'm so overjoyed by answers that I was just dumbfounded. \n\nI have an appointment to see him, get the full run down, and start planning in 6 weeks. \n\nSince that shitty ordeal, I've been home, mainly bed ridden. Scrolling through social media, I've found that I'm not angry anymore, I can actually look at our friends children and not be filled with resentment and jealousy. I actually commented on a photo, of how big little S is and we need to catch up when I'm mobile again, and the best part was, \nI actually meant it. \n\nI'm actually more friends with the father (K) of S, but since they started dating, the mother (A) has really grown on me and we actually get along really well. But once she became pregnant, I kind of pushed them both away, as it caused me so much pain. Both the Mum and Dad have commented on how they want me and partner to be a part of their child's life, and how they think we'll be great parents, usual friends-with-babies stuff. \n\nBut today, out of the blue, A messaged me. \"Can I ask, is it endo that you've got? K and I were talking about you and (partner) trying but couldn't remember\"\n\nAs I was typing her a little post-surgery update she followed up with this. \n\n\"Because I said to him that I'd surrogate for you if it ended up being what you needed\"\n\nI have never cried so hard, and so quickly in my entire life. Partner and I have talked about surrogacy, if we needed to go there, but I couldn't think of anyone who we thought would do it for us. Partner seems to think it's not that big of a deal of expect someone to carry our baby around for 9 months and then hand it over and not be a parent (anyone else have this problem?)   I'm just in awe of the utter selflessness of this offer, and am honestly feeling blessed to have such wonderful people around me. \n\nI just wanted to share some good news, after two years of waiting for this surgery,  it sure does feel like a win to come out with answers.

We've gone through every conceivable test and there's no explanation as to our infertility. My FSH was apparently off the charts for my age (8.1)  and hubs has lots of strong swimmers as well as all other test being good. \nI feel guilty about this after reading r/infertility. We've been trying for 2 years. We love our infertility doctor. After all the diagnostic tests, and things came back ok, he asked if we were \"doing it\" right bc we hadn't been successful. Through all the months of tests, arguing with insurance, and first round of IUI, I felt like this was it, that it WAS going to happen for us. The first IUI didn't take and I'm back to day 1. I called and scheduled my ultrasound before going on letrozol. When I called, the nurse said she was hoping for better news and was apologetic. Then she asked if we were wanting to do another round of IUI. I have no idea why, but the way she said it... It felt like she was saying \"it's a waste of money but if it makes you feel better then....\" Not in a million years do I think that's what she meant but I don't understand where this &lt;emotion&gt; is coming from. I feel like a freaking crazy person. I feel absolutely doomed. Like I am wasting thousands of dollars with no hope. I'm trying to figure out where the hell I tripped my insanity button bc I truly feel like I've lost my mind. \nThe other piece troubling me is that I feel like my story isn't \"sad\" enough. I read other people's heartbreaking stories and what they are doing and I feel like we \"have it better than most.\" Almost like survivors guilt. Like we haven't spent $10k yet so we haven't joined a special club. \nThat brings me to my last point in that I feel isolated even though I visit here often. Most posts I see relate to frozen embryos or IVF; so I can't relate to either of those things. \nAm I feeling normal given our situation?\nWhy...WHY? What is wrong with me/us?\nAm I throwing my money away with IUI?\nWhy have I turned into an insane person?\n\n... And I fully expect to get a message from mods saying \"your post has been removed because...see posting rule 489....\" (I've not had good luck with posting on Reddit.)\nI'm struggling r/infertility, and I'm hoping someone will ha e some magic words to help me through this.\n{There's no tl;dr.

And the doctor (a gynecologist) was the sweetest woman ever. She took her time, talked with us, looked over my wife's previous journals. Discussed our situation and told us that there is nothing she could do, that we needed to go to an infertility doctor (which we basically knew, we yust had to have a gynecologist reffer us) talked about beeing positive on our behalf and how she believed that we would be wonderful parents when our time came etc... \n\nSo then we waited for one year until we got an appointment at the infertility doctor..... And that lady was not so nice, aggressive, arrogant, and basically insulted us for having a refferal to IVF. The plan was to start with pre treatment for IVF but she instead canceled the treatment, and told us she wanted us to try some avulation drugs and a laprascopic surgery for my wife. She was basically more interested in talking about her new job she was soon to start. And told us that \"they would be in contact after the surgery\"\nSo we go back on wait list for lap. which went OK, but guess what, no luck. So we wait and after 6 months we call the the hospital, and they could see that we where there, but no one was asked to contact us.... So we got an appointment, and a new doctor. \n\nThis new doctor is absolutely not interested at all, halfway through the session he invites inn a student, (which basically don't bother us, but he could have asked, the student was actually appeared embarrassed to come inn whiteout introduction or invention from us (the patients)) He tells us that there was no need for the drugs or the lap because he don't think that they ever works anyhow. So he puts us back on wait list for IVF, saying that \"it's a long list that don't get shorter\". And is basically arrogant and don't inspire confidence. \n\nNo new contact with the hospital, but we call them on the phone so three weeks ago we start on the down stimulation drugs, and based on previous experiences was not exited for the appointment today. \nSo today the third doctor at the hospital. We are greeted by a nice nurse that shows us into the doctor, who immediately introduces us to her student. She apologizes that she has been on leave for a while so she needs some help with the nurse for the forms she needs to fill out because she is out of practice. Tells us that she need to \"over communicate\" all the information because she has a student who needs to learn, although she believes that we probably knows most of it from before. Calmly explains what the plan is for today, checks my wife, explains why she want to use the dose of stims, the type of medication, and the plan for the next weeks. All the time she is smiling, nice, and well yust nice. It felt that she was on our team. \n\nWe where actually shocked at the difference with three doctors at the same department, after a finishing talk with the nurse who shows us how to place the needles, and some more explanations, we go home and we both feel that it was actually a nice appointment. \n\nSo to summarize. 1st. doctor: nice, 2.nd doctor: aggressive/insulting not nice. 3rd. doctor: non-interested duche, 4th doctor/nurse team: nice. \n\nSorry for the long text yust had to vent a bit.
