And no unprotected sex with hubby for 6 months.  I can deal with that.\n\nBUT the other scenario is that this retrieval is a bust and I want to do another retrieval.  What I can gather is that the female risk is passing it during pregnancy (obviously not a part of a retrieval).  What I can gather about the male risk is they can transmit it, but I don't know how.  So I can't figure out if his sperm is affected.  If we did a retrieval round with ICSI like normal, is there still a risk or do we have to still wait 6 months before doing a retrieval.\n\nI'm kind of freaking out now.  I've been looking forward to this trip since we started IVF in January because we'd had it planned for a year and a half already.  My whole family is going on this trip.  I'd only been focused on the \"could I cruise if pregnant\" up until it was clear that wasn't a risk, but I had just assumed that the cruises wouldn't be exposing people to zika so it wasn't something that affected me.\n\nHas anyone done any medical research on how zika is transmitted/effects males?  I've sent a message to my clinic, but I really wonder how much more information they will have other than the vague info the CDC has out.\n\nEdited to Update: RE approved freezing sperm before the trip in the event we want to do another retrieval in &lt;6 months, and it's an 8 week wait for me before moving forward with retrieval or transfer.

I was diagnosed with mild PCOS due to irregular cycles, but I confirmed I was ovulating through most of them with temping, which my RE knows. \n\nMy husband's SA resulted a 19milion/ml count, with a 40% motility, and lousy 2% morphology. My RE seemed really unconcerned with this, dismissing it as normal and saying the 2% morph was likely the fault of the lab tech. Meanwhile, over the last five months since we got that result, I've Dr. Google'd the shit out of that SA result, and the internets say that while not the end of the world, it is a lousy result and at least merits some kind of follow up, with most people dealing with those kind of numbers going straight to IVF w/ ICSI. It's been 2.5 years of timed intercourse with nada to show. I also had asked my RE about IUI, which she also dismissed saying, \"it'll just wash away the good sperm\".  She also dismissed anything helping boost his sperm count, saying it's all pseudoscience. \n\nI finally emailed my RE yesterday and asked - why can't we at least try IUI? Are my husband's counts too low? If so, can we be referred to a urologist? \n\nShe responded that if I would like to try IUI \"that's fine but, women with PCOS don't have any increased benefit from IUI over timed intercourse.\" \n\nCome on lady, are we still operating under the presumption that this is all my body's doing? Am I taking crazy pills? I'm ovulating on my own, and his SA sucked! She did say \"if you would like to do a repeat SA and see the urologist that is up to you\".  I feel defeated, like she doesn't give a shit what I do, after the third cycle of femara fails she's just going to say, \"well, that didn't work. Might wanna scrape up the IVF money.\" And that's it. \n\nThis is the same RE who has never checked my FSH because it's \"old science\" and my AMH was all she cared about. I've never had my progesterone checked either. \n\nI don't have the option of switching RE's because that is the only clinic covered under my health insurance. \n\nSo should I push for IUI, or is this a waste of time? \n\nEdit - I also want to mention, my first cycle of letrozole was only 2.5mg, and I had no response to it. When I went to my baseline scan yesterday, I had to specifically ask the doctor doing the u/s (not my RE) if they could increase to 5mg this cycle. They were like, \"ok sure, that's probably a good idea\". What in the actual f..? I feel like I'm the only one who cares at all where my course of treatment is going.

A follow up staging surgery noted the presence of endometriosis and I had an endometrial biopsy (negative) but I was never given any kind of education about this. Moving out of state and switching doctors, my endometriosis diagnosis slipped between the cracks. A couple years later I had another surgery for a mass on my remaining ovary- also borderline malignant but they were able to leave my ovary. \n\nI've been dealing with pelvic pain for years and just assumed it was \"normal\" until the intensity and frequency of it really amped up in the last year or so. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for two years with no luck. Letrozole did make me ovulate but I didn't get pregnant after 3 ovulating rounds on it. \n\nI went back to my doctor a few weeks ago with pelvic and lower back pain complaints believing I may have cyst issues going on again. She ordered a MRI which showed an endometrioma from what I can tell on the report, and a l5-s1 disc issue. \n\nMy follow up appointment with my gyno to go over the MRI is next week.\n\nAfter my appointment with her when reading over my old medical records is when I discovered mention of endometriosis. I immediately called and talked to her nurse and had her pass that on and faxed the related records mentioning endo to them. My doctor said in a note back to the nurse, endo won't be picked up by MRI necessarily (which I knew) and I expect surgery will be brought up by her in my appointment next week- and I plan to ask about it.\n\nI also saw a spinal doctor about the disc issue discovered and mentioned the endometriosis to him and he thinks my lower back pain could very well be connected to that (shocking for a male non gynecologist doctor to clearly have seen the correlation enough to ask me if it was worse during my period and if I had endometriosis). He is sending me for another MRI of my lumbar spine (waiting on a peer to peer review with my insurance to approve it)\n\nSorry this sequence is a bit jumbled. My research in the last couple weeks shows some doctors prescribe hormones to \"control\" endo. But the only way to know for sure and actually treat it, is surgery. I've had 5 surgeries- that doesn't concern me and if it will bring me pain relief and possibly help my fertility, I welcome it. I am very much AGAINST hormones for it because birth control gave me awful mental health side effects, and that will be counter productive to trying to conceive. \n\nMy other fear is the endometriosis and it being on my ovary apparently, could mean I may lose that ovary and Bye Bye pregnancy. Egg harvesting is out of the question for us financially. \n\nI've spent a lot of time on /r/endo but I'm trying to figure out what questions to pose when I see my gyno- specifically related to endo and fertility. At this point, I WANT surgery. For pain relief and the possibility it could help us conceive. I live in a very rural area with no endo specialists for several hours. We are planning to move out of state later this year and where we will be, I will have an endo excision expert half an hour from me.\n\nWhat questions should I ask? I feel I should instruct her to remove all endo she can, but leave my ovary. And then see an endo specialist who may be more skilled at removing it from my ovary while leaving the remaining ovary I have intact. I need to have this surgery currently because of the pain. I'm missing work. I'm missing out on life. It's debilitating. I realize it could very well just be a temporary fix but if it gives me pain relief from removing whatever endo she can, until I move and can see a specialist, I'm all for it. \n\nThose of you dealing with endometriosis and fertility concerns, what would you do and what questions would you ask?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "One ovary, endometriosis, and PCOS - beginning to accept it may never happen for us", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/65h9ru/one_ovary_endometriosis_and_pcos_beginning_to/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492250778, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/65ie45/saturday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "65ie45", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 138, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/65ie45/saturday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1494598183, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

I'm benched with a cyst right now which is leaving me a lot of time to think. I need help deciding when to move on. Forgive me as this may be a bit long.\n\nI appear to be quite \"healthy\" reproductively. CD3 bloods are within norms, AMH is high at 11.2ng/L. We're dealing with MFI. Not *really* severe MFI, but borderline counts, low motility, 3% morph and 90% ASAs. We've done 2 IUIs with injectables which have failed miserably. I respond well to the meds with ~3 mature follicles each time (which coincidentally both happened to be on the left ovary). First cycle, we had 5.7 mil for insem which he said was \"as good as you'll get\" kinda odds with IUI at 20-22%. Second cycle was lower at 2.3 mil sperm to which he gave us a 10-15% chance. So I know there's not zero chance, which is somewhat promising. I am starting to feel like maybe we have a fertilization issue related to the ASAs (highly likely IMO).\n\nI recently met with my RE to have a pre-IVF chat. He doesn't think I should give up yet, but supports me if I'm fed up and ready to move on. He recently had a patient conceive twins via injectables IUI with 100% ASAs, with only 1.5 million total motile sperm for insem. So I think he's just feeling positive about it.\n\nFinancially, IUI is not a huge impact for us. $325 out of pocket for the sperm processing and meds are covered. After 2 failures though, I'm beginning to lose hope that this will work. I know three is the \"magic number\" so to speak... so I'm wondering if I should just do one more to say that we went as far as was reasonable before doing IVF (and of course putting some stock into us winning the infertility lottery and having success). \n\nIf we choose to move on, we can go any time. I would be doing a natural start antagonist protocol. It's going to cost $8100. FETs are $1200.\n\nThoughts? Advice? What would you do? What have you done?

I've scoured through various studies trying to find the supplements that offer me the best chance.  Does anyone have any experience with these and what are some potential risks?\n\nThank you in advance for any help.\n\nHello All,     \nI'm going to apologize in advance if I'm breaking any of the rules here.  I've tried reading through the FAQs and rules, and I'm not sure if I'm in violation here.  Also, apologies for the throwaway, but people know my main account who I don't necessarily want knowing about this (or some things I reveal below).  Also, I hope I use the correct acronyms and terms.\n\n**Background**     \nAfter 6 months of trying to conceive, I went for my yearly physical and expressed concern to my physician.  He referred me to a urologist who sent me for labs and a semenalysis.  The first semenalysis didn't come back good, but didn't come too bad.  He said IUI would be possible.  I had a count of 20 mil, 18% motility (0 Rapid, 6 Slow, 12 Non-Progressive, 82 Non-Motile), and 0% of sperm with normal morphology. \n\nThe doctor said that there were still sperm so IUI may be possible.  He wanted to send me for a second analysis, lab work, and ultrasound.  The Labwork came back with elevated levels of Prolactin and FSH at 6.  He referred me to a endocrinologist.\n\nThe endocrinologist found that while my Prolactin was high, my LH was normal.  We also found my T4 was high,  but T3 and TSH were normal.  She said she wanted a follow up for bloodwork in 3 months (July), but that there weren't any issues affecting my sex hormones.\n\nThe Ultrasound came back with a mild varicocele and recommended speaking with a microsurgeon (appointment scheduled for the end of May).\n\nThe second Semenalysis came back pretty bad.  Count of 3 million, but improved motility at 30% (0-R, 24-S, 6-NP, and 70-NM), 0% normal morphology. He told me that this test was showing too low of a count for IUI.  I'm sure you can imagine this kind of crushed my wife and I.  He had 0 explanation for the dramatic differences.  My wife was with me for the second one, and she \"assisted\" me with some mild prostate stimulation.  I'm wondering if that skewed the results but when I asked the doctor, he didn't seem to have an answer and wanted to wait 3 months for the follow up.\n\nHe did prescribe me Clomid, but did not have high hopes for it working because my FSH was above 4.\n\nIn the meantime, I've also scheduled an appointment with a fertility specialist who appears to be very well known and has people travel from out of state to see him (benefit of big city I suppose).  I see him in the middle of June.  I also have a 3rd semenalysis scheduled for early July, which will be 90 days since the Clomid was prescribed.  \n\n**Current Plan**    \nI'm not the kind of guy to sit around and just wait for things.  I understand what I'm looking for is a long shot at best.  At worst, I want to make sure I don't do any real damage to myself. I don't know what the worst case scenario is for taking what I'm proposing and that's what I'm looking for. \n\nI'm also wondering if my wife and I should stop any butt stuff (pegging and the like) because if that could cause any issues in regards to sperm quality.  \n\nWhat I'm asking is if anyone has any experience with any of this stuff and if I can damage myself further taking all these supplements.  Let's be honest, this is a lot of crap I'm going to start dumping into my already damaged body. I'll also mention, I have no history with drugs or steroid use. I was obese most of my life, but I am now at a very healthy weight and a pretty good athlete (in my opinion, I place well in my age group at different 5ks I do).  I am also 35 years old.  \n\nHere's everything I have:    \n\n**Aescin, Escin, Horse Chest Nut (all the same)**\n30 mg bid    \n*Available as 250 mg, 22% Aescin; will only take once per day instead of twice*    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854092/     \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19682880     \n\n**Ashwagandha**   \n225 mg 3x Daily\n*Unable to replicate dose of 225 mg 3x daily - 500 mg bid daily or 250 mg 3x daily if pill that can be cut.*     \n*Alternative.  280 day supply; not pills, mixable powder)*\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3863556/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19501822\n\n\n**Astaxanthin**    \n16 mg Daily   \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16110353    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3721213/ \n\n**Coenzyme Q10**   \n60 mg Daily   \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800531/    \n*There is no evidence in the literature that CoQ10 increases either live birth or pregnancy rates, but there is a global improvement in sperm parameters.*    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19509475    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16873942   \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9266524   \n\n**Eurycoma Longifolia**\n200 mg Daily     \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348942    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28259255    \n\n**Fish Oil/Omega 3 Fatty Acids**     \n+Needs at leastr 515.2 mg EPA, 331.2 mg DHA    \nNot sure I'll buy a special one for this, might just double my current which would put me about 200 mg short on the EPA.    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854092/    \n*In a study of 211 infertile men with abnormal semen parameters, omega-3 supplementation (515.2 mg EPA and 331.2 mg DHA daily) for 28 weeks improved sperm concentration (28.7 \u00d7 106 vs 16.2 \u00d7 106 ml\u22121, P = 0.001), motility (27.4% vs 18.6%, P = 0.002), and morphology (12.8% vs 7.5%, P = 0.002).*\n\n**Folic Acid**   \n5 mg Daily    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11872201    \n5 tabs needed per study as tablets are 1 mcg only.\n\n**Glutathione**    \n600 mg IM* daily    \n* Unable to administer IM   \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854092/    \nParagraph that uses citation 51:    \n*Glutathione supplementation improved sperm motility (38.5% vs 26.0%, P &lt; 0.01) and morphology (atypical forms 48.1% vs 62.5%, P &lt; 0.001) after 1 month of treatment.

I'm 35, unexplained delayed fertility. Hubby has a bit of clumping but no other obvious problems. \nI'm an IVF first timer after several years of trying. Things were going rad until...they didn't. \n\nI learned of my second missed miscarriage ten days ago, at the 12w scan. This was just over two years after the same, naturally conceived but discovered lost at an 11w scan. With this one I was anxious the whole time, especially so in that last week. Both times no miscarriage symptoms for me, in fact I *thought* I still had pregnancy symptoms. Ugh. \n\nI had another D&amp;C shortly after and was headfucked for the first week (it definitely didn't help having two young women getting abortions right after me in theatre), but since we had an Easter break in there, went away for four nights to camp in the wilderness (ugh, families out camping). I'm just about to head back to work today (ugh, explaining my absence).  But ultimately both my husband and I feel like this one is easier to cope with. Perhaps we understand the emotions better, or perhaps we have no idea and it will hit us later. But we are both planners so having a next step gives us both comfort.  I definitely have feelings of \"I'm barren and it'll never happen\" but trying very hard not to let those sink right in....by getting my motorbike licence. Another post probably. \n\nMy question is around those next steps. 2017 was going to be set aside for an IVF binge and we saved for it so in a way we are prepared.  We have two frozen embryos from the first cycle that were biopsied but not screened as our fresh transfer worked. We've called the clinic and asked for screening, it'll take a couple weeks.  In the pre-theatre work up, an angel nurse in a similar IF position as me successfully negotiated for genetic testing of the foetus (through the public health system here), which is only normally done after the third loss so there will be results from that coming.  My husband strongly believes we should use these before we try any more retrieval cycles. I'm across that, although I do know the anxiety from waiting is hard, and it got worse after I had the positive test. It's unavoidable though, right? I can't imagine it'll get any easier. \n\nI'm wondering about doing a retrieval cycle also. How long after a D&amp;C can these realistically be started, egg wise? Should I follow my gut (or anxiety avoidant) instinct and do one of these, or do a FET, assuming one of these are alright? If so, what's the waiting time on that, lining wise? My periods have always been regular and IIRC there wasn't too much of a delay in resuming after my first D&amp;C.  \n\nThanks in advance for your advice and hugs to you all. I read a lot of your stories and feel for every one of you.

On the 17th, I had laparoscopic surgery to remove my left tube, which was my only remaining tube. This was the result of my 3rd ectopic pregnancy. I lost my right tube in January 2016 to my first ectopic pregnancy.\n\nThe loss of this pregnancy and my tube has been pretty traumatic. So many visits to the ER, two injections of methotrexate, 6 ultrasounds, 3 pelvic exams, more blood tests than I can count... and here we are. We did everything we could to avoid this happening. We gave it every available chance to allow it to resolve without another salpingectomy. But, alas, I guess life had other plans.\n\nAnyway, now we're in totally uncharted territory. Obviously I'm still healing from surgery, and can't try for a few months because of the methotrexate anyway. We've got a referral in to the local fertility centre (Ottawa, ON), and we're waiting for a call back for our first appointment. This is all totally mind-numbing. To be tubeless at 27 is a bit shocking for me. I think it still has yet to fully hit me. I got an email from Kindara today and realized that I'll never have need to temp again, and that was a little jarring. \n\nSo, just wanted to introduce myself. I'm 27, self-employed, grad school hopeful, living in Canada with my husband who is 29 and a retired veteran. If anyone has any tips/tricks for navigating Ontario's IVF system/funding, I'd love to hear em. Otherwise, you can probably expect to hear from me in the future. I'll be around.\n\nWishing you all the best of luck, and thanks for existing. &lt;3", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Newly Tubeless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/66a81j/newly_tubeless/"}, {"author": "ivegotbabyrabies", "author_created_utc": 1417792201, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "29F, MFI, IUI #1 April", "author_fullname": "t2_jtl9a", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492620078, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/66bdok/ivf_in_prague/", "gilded": 0, "id": "66bdok", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 17, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/66bdok/ivf_in_prague/", "retrieved_on": 1494612614, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm starting to seriously look into this - with our MFI numbers, I think our chances of IUI succeeding are pretty low.

I forgot to mention that part of my jitters are also that I gained some weight in the last year, since I was injured and unable to be active.

Turns out I'm totally fine but hubby has zero sperm, like absolutely zero, probably never has (yes we did all the tests, we didn't go through TESE or biopsies because the hope for success was 1% and not worth the emotional or physical pain). We looked at the idea of using known donor but the risks outweighed the positives and then we spent a lot of time back and forth between donor or adoption or childfree. After switching doctors and getting referred to a fabulous therapist my husband came to terms with the diagnosis and we agreed on unknown donor sperm.  \n\nI narrowed down the entire catalogue of donors from all the different companies to 5 candidates and my husband made the final choice, luckily his choice was the one that the sperm bank said was his match :-). It was way easier than either of us thought and we're both totally on board, happy with our choice and ready to go.\n\nYesterday we got the go ahead from the doctor to order the sample and we're hoping for a successful IUI next week!!!! \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro - IUI #1 with donor sperm soon!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/66e9ck/intro_iui_1_with_donor_sperm_soon/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492651809, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/66emef/8cm_endometrioma_in_my_pouch_of_douglas/", "gilded": 0, "id": "66emef", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/66emef/8cm_endometrioma_in_my_pouch_of_douglas/", "retrieved_on": 1494614217, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "title": "8cm endometrioma in my pouch of douglas", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/66emef/8cm_endometrioma_in_my_pouch_of_douglas/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492661836, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/66fgia/new_here_what_should_i_expect/", "gilded": 0, "id": "66fgia", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/66fgia/new_here_what_should_i_expect/", "retrieved_on": 1494614628, "score": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "title": "New Here.

There's one girl in particular that claims doctors labeled her infertile and said she would never have kids....yet this bitch is announcing her third pregnancy.  She wore this infertile label like a badge of honor.  She could never shut up about it.  \nI was super emotional, so I decided to talk to her and ask what procedures were successful for her, but she didn't have any.  She said the prayed about it.  All three, she prayed about all three and they just happened, like magic, relatively quickly.  I basically told her I thought she was full of shit regarding her claimed infertility, and I explained to her how it makes light of people with actual fertility problems.  I explained my issues and losses, only to be told that maybe if I wasn't such a negative person, God would give me a miracle too.\n\nI've run into other people like this in my life, but I singled in on this girl probably due to the timing of my loss and her announcement.  I just don't understand people. \n\nSeeing her current FB posts with a new baby, knowing that the baby I lost should be born around this time, just makes me feel sorry for myself all over again.

We were NTNP until May 2016 when I began tracking and researching how to make conception happen since apparently just having sex wasn't working for us. I tend to get positive OPKs around CD 14, then according to temping, I O around CD 15-16 each month (with a random O on CD19 once.) I do have a thyroid disease (Graves) but keep it in check with meds. I get my thyroid hormones checked every 2-3 months and they have been stable since June 2016.\n\nMy husband got a SA done with good results in Nov 2016 (69mill, 2.8 vol, 74% forward progression). Then last month I visited my OB to discuss possible issues. I have regular periods, albeit they're only 3 days long. I've been told this isn't a big deal by 2 OBs so hopefully they're right! I had my progesterone checked at 6DPO (office closed my 7-8DPO) and it was slightly low @ 11.9. Last month I started Clomid to help strengthen O and increase my progesterone. That's been making me feel awful (see post history :( ). At my CD12 ultrasound this month, I had 1 big follicle (18mm) on the right and 2 medium ones (15-16mm) on the left with some really small ones as well. We've tried every day, every other day, sex right after positive OPKs, using pre-seed and just about everything under the sun, it seems yet no babe after a year. \n\nAfter following this subreddit and /r/stilltrying, I've decided to move on to an RE since it seems OBs can sometimes not be so great at getting you pregnant. Mine didn't even order CD3 testing to rule out PCOS. I was told since I'm regular and periods are normal, I probably don't have PCOS so she didn't think it should be done... But I feel like it should be? My HSG is scheduled for the first of May to check the tubes, so fingers crossed that goes well.\n\nI scheduled my first RE appointment for end of May, right around the beginning of when my cycle 13 of TTC should start. I'm really excited as he's got excellent reviews and seemingly great success. The huge downside is my insurance covers nada for infertility work so not looking forward to the medical bills that will be coming our way. \n\nAnywho, if I ask stupid questions about anything, please excuse me as I join the world of infertility with my limited knowledge.\n\nEdit: grammar, words, and stuffs", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Making the transition over. hello everyone!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/66jmz5/making_the_transition_over_hello_everyone/"}]}
