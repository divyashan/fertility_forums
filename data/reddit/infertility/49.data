Last year we did 2 IVF cycles, both with PGS.  \n\nFirst cycle we had 8 eggs, 2 were too big or small to use, 2 did not fertilize, and 1 did not survive the first 3 days.  3 embryos made it to day 3 and were tested and all 3 came back genetically abnormal so nothing was transferred.\n\nSecond cycle we had 9 eggs, 8 fertilized and made it to day 3 and were tested, and only 2 came back normal.  Both transferred at the same time but neither implanted.\n\nNow we are considering trying IVF again and need to decide if we would do PGS again or not.  We're really torn because we've read some studies that suggest that some PGS abnormalities might be false positives and some embryos could get damaged in the process.  Also since last year our clinic has changed their process so all PGS biopsies happen on day 5, which means the embryos all have to be biopsied, then frozen, then thawed, than transferred.  Seems like a lot that can go wrong.\n\nPart of the concern is also cost.  Most of our IVF costs will be paid out of pocket to the tune of $12,000 for the base cycle.  PGS is another $2,500 for the biopsy plus $2,500 to the lab, plus the cost of a frozen cycle so all together it's an extra $8k-$10k on top of the $12k we'd already be paying.\n\nBUT if we don't do PGS we will likely pay more for failed transfers.\n\nFinancially speaking the most we can afford to spend on IVF this year is around $25k.  If we do not do PGS then we could probably do 2 cycles (if needed).  If we do PGS then we're probably limited to 1 cycle.\n\nWhat would you do?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trying to decide on PGS...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/777oz5/trying_to_decide_on_pgs/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1508351749, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/778m73/wednesday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "id": "778m73", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 108, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/778m73/wednesday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1508435863, "score": 4, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

My name is /r/DefinitelyNotABoner. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 15 after having my period for 8 months straight. I am obese, though currently losing (35lbs down so far!) through keto and exercise. My husband and I have been trying for about 18 months cumulative (though 12 months total now since we took a few month break after trying for about 6 months before) and had our first RE appointment yesterday. \n\nI guess I'm posting here because honestly no one in my real life really gets this. I'm at an age where a lot of my friends and family have been asking about \"when\" we'll get started, and even if I'm 100% honest and transparent about our stuggles I end up getting bingoed about their friend's sister's mother has had four successes since she last relaxed. Thankfully my partner is wonderfully loving and supportive, and he lets me bitch and moan about this as much as I want (a lot). \n\nI think for a while I felt like I didn't really deserve to even post here since many of you have been here much longer with much more difficult journeys so far, but after the RE yesterday I'm pretty overwhelmed by the information. I'm having an ultrasound on Monday (I honestly can't remember why). I have a dermoid tumor on one of my ovaries that is going to be removed soon, and my RE also suspects Endometriosis. I've been doing keto, but their practice puts all of their PCOS patients on a keto diet as the first step for interventions. At least I have that going for me. :)\n\nI think the next step is a Hysteroscopy and HSG at my next cycle. **(Edit: He is also doing an HSG during my Hysteroscopy - thank you! That helps when googling.)** ~~Totally not sure if that is the name of the procedure.~~ There was something about a catheter and checking to make sure my tubes were open. I just know it also involved a day off work and Lortab/Xanax for the appointment. Has anyone had any experience with this? I'm a bit nervous because I've only ever really had my wisdom teeth out other than this and transvaginal ultrasounds. Is it super painful or just relatively uncomfortable? I'm not used to being so uninformed about stuff like this, but all of the information at the appointment was a lot and it was difficult to absorb everything. My husband will also be getting a SA at my hysteroscopy appointment.\n\nAnyways, I don't have a huge support system about all of this other than my husband. I'm looking forward to interacting with you all and learning more about this process.  \n\n&lt;3", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro + Overwhelmed", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/77feua/intro_overwhelmed/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1508438157, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/77gft3/thursday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "id": "77gft3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 152, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/77gft3/thursday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1508523306, "score": 1, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

So, since I don't even have the PGS results yet, for all I know that one could be defective and die as well. To say I am devastated is an understatement. I really need someone to talk me off the ledge, to be honest...\n\nAnyway, the plan is to use a carrier after my hysterectomy, of course. However, given the shit results from IVF number 1, I'll have to do more cycles after a hysterectomy. My RE's warned me that sometimes ovaries suck even more (not their words but you get the idea) after a hyster, because of decreased blood flow to the ovaries. I haven't found any scientific articles about that, and the RE's didn't say exactly by how much would me eggs suck harder (sorry, am not feeling eloquent right now). I was really, really hoping/praying for a successful pre-hyster IVF cycle to compensate for this, but as I wrote about, that didn't happen.\n\nSo I don't know what to do right now. Delay the hysterectomy (meaning I have pain for longer) and do more IVF cycles, or do the hyster next week (doctor also wants to \"clean up\" my left ovary, possibly allowing it to respond better to IVF meds next time) and cross my fingers, sacrifice a small animal, and otherwise hope for the best?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for advice regarding IVF after a hysterectomy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/77ggro/looking_for_advice_regarding_ivf_after_a/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "SleepIsForChumps", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1508438988, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/77gjdk/that_face_when_your_surrogate_triples_her_price/", "id": "77gjdk", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/77gjdk/that_face_when_your_surrogate_triples_her_price/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1508524170, "score": 0, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "That face when your surrogate triples her price during negotiations.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/77gjdk/that_face_when_your_surrogate_triples_her_price/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "k_snowflake", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "35, 2.5years, 1 CP, PCOS,limbo. maybe the dingo ate my baby?", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1508449159, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/77hlb4/what_does_infertility_feel_like/", "id": "77hlb4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 132, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/77hlb4/what_does_infertility_feel_like/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1508533737, "score": 30, "selftext": "I've been thinking about this a lot lately, as it feels like my pain from infertility is a tangible object I've been carrying with me for years now.

I've done some looking around, and some other places offer risk sharing plans/multiple cycle discounts that look a tad lower but may not include all the extras like ICSI. Realistically we would have to put this on a credit card and wouldn't have any more credit available for another retrieval if this didn't work. RE says we have 80-90% chance of success from 1 retrieval though I'm a little skeptical. I'm torn because I like our RE and the idea of starting IVF immediately with next cycle is appealing (RE has said time is of the essence and we'd want to do it within next 6 months). But I also don't want us to be shooting ourselves in the foot / making a terrible financial decision if we'd be likely to get a much better / smarter price / package elsewhere. How do y'all navigate making this decision and figuring out what is / is not a good value? \n\nFeeling very overwhelmed and need to decide within next week if we're going to go forward with IVF at this clinic or not...

I'm new to Reddit, and finally decided to create an account so I could post here. \n\nMy husband and I have been trying (off and on) since July 2012. Our official diagnosis is \"unexplained infertility,\" which frustrates the living shit out of me. There's nothing obviously wrong with either of us--all tests check out totally normal. I'm 33 and don't have any health issues, and my husband is 35, and also completely healthy. Our doctor literally scratched his head and said \"well kids, I'm stumped.\" Thanks. So glad I'm paying you thousands of dollars. \n\nI might be a little salty today.

I\u2019m ready for it to stop but didn\u2019t know where else to turn but to vent here. I hope that\u2019s ok.\n\nThree months ago, I had an ectopic pregnancy. It was my fourth cycle of Clomid and second IUI. That was tragic in and of itself. You would think that would be enough to go through for a while, right?\n\nThen about two months ago, I noticed I was having difficulty hearing in my right ear. It got quickly and progressively worse over several days. Sometimes it was painful and almost always accompanied by very loud ringing and humming in that ear. Multiple doctors put me on all sorts of drugs. In the end, diagnosed with sudden sensorineural hearing loss triggered by some sort of autoimmune response because of my rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment? Heavy steroids and a steroid injection into my middle ear (scheduled for next week).\n\nOh and did I mention I\u2019m a musician and the hearing loss also created a pitch differential between my two ears? Diplacusis is what I learned it\u2019s called. Music has been intolerable to listen to for weeks and very hard to make music, which was one of my ways to relax when stressed or sad about infertility or anything else. With steroids, all of that is getting better but there isn\u2019t an end in sight to the treatment at the moment. So no getting pregnant for me for a while.\n\nBut even that is not enough. Due to something....stress, weight loss (I\u2019ve lost 45 pounds since February), Clomid, the methotrexate I had to take for the ectopic, the steroids, or who knows what, now I\u2019M LOSING MY HAIR.\n\nOn top of everything, my hair is drastically thinning and falling out. I bought a $300 wig today. I\u2019m not using it yet but wanted to be prepared rather than panic if the day comes that the thin patches turn to bald spots.

She took it pretty well, and I while I felt good that I said something, I was just annoyed that the burden is on us infertiles to tell people to be more sensitive, especially to women of childbearing age.\n\nAnother fun thing I\u2019m dealing with \u2013 I got pregnant the same time as another colleague. She announced a month after I miscarried. She had a drunken hookup with her ex and decided to keep it. She\u2019s always texting me photos and videos of her girl, reminding me how old my kid would have been if it survived.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now. Thanks for having this SR.

For my egg retrieval cycle, my lining got up over 10mm, and so we never anticipated I\u2019d have any lining issues. However, in my first, and now my second, FET cycle, my lining has gotten to 7.96mm (in my 1st) and 7.21mm (in my 2nd), and then progressively gotten smaller. In fact, the more estrogen they put me on (I\u2019m currently on cream (2 mg), patches (3), pills \u2013 both orally and vaginally, gel, and ring form), the more my lining seems to shrink.\n\nIn both cycles, I peaked while on lower-dosages of estrogen, only to see my lining get smaller at each successive lining check. I did not experience any bleeding.\n\nI am currently on Lupron, Gonal-F (as a way to stimulate my ovaries into producing their own estrogen), the aforementioned estrogen, vaginal Viagra, Vitamin E, L-Arginine, CoQ10, a prenatal with DHA, baby aspirin, and Folgard. In this current cycle, they did three GCSF washes and an \u201cendometrial disruption,\u201d which culminated in no difference, as evidenced by today\u2019s lining check, which measured me at 5.6 mm.  \n\nEach FET cycle was preceded by a hysteroscopy. It seems like the harder we try, the worse conditions get.\n\nEmbarrassingly, I also did acupuncture, drank pomegranate juice, drank red raspberry leaf tea, and drank bone broth.\n\nI am desperate to hear of anything that worked. Just any insight, too, would be helpful. It seems like my doctor has used all of her \u201ctricks,\u201d and I may be fresh out of luck. More than anything, I want to be a mother. I\u2019ve fought tirelessly for two years, and just when I thought we were done, when we got to the \u201cslam dunk\u201d portion of this horrible journey, I\u2019ve hit another fucking roadblock.\n\nFor context, I don\u2019t ovulate on my own, and even when I do, my eggs don\u2019t fertilize on their own without ICSI.

I asked if an office visit could be billed, and was told yes. And starting going down the path of in face meeting instead.\nI was interested in speaking to Dr Elias and Dr Reichman to help decide who I wanted to work with.\nThis is where it got strange.\nI called Dr Elias' office and scheduled the consultation\nI called Dr Reichman' office and tried to schedule an appt. I was told Dr Reichman has a policy, that he does not accept transfer of other patients within the group. So if I see Dr Elias first, I am not allowed to book a consultation with Dr Reichman.?!!\nI guess he doesn't want to be pitted against his colleagues in the same group?\nI am going to keep my appt with Dr Elias and see how that goes.......\n\nHow have your experiences been when switching?\n\n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Deciding if I should change clinics/RE - experience so far", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/78j8u7/deciding_if_i_should_change_clinicsre_experience/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "Picklina", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "32, TTC since 1/2015, 4 failed IUI, fuck this shit.", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1508887348, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/78jpok/endometritis_panic_and_general_whining/", "id": "78jpok", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/78jpok/endometritis_panic_and_general_whining/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1508969781, "score": 2, "selftext": "My very helpful  (insurance mandated) lab just did me the huge solid (haha!) of emailing me the results of my endometrial biopsy pathology report that just came out.

After my monitoring ultrasound this morning, they upped my dose to 400iu of follistim and 20 of low dose HCG.  I took this as an indication that things aren't going well, so that's a nice kick in the nuts.  \n\nSince I will TEAR MY FUCKING EYEBALLS OUT if I go the other internet forums with all of the lovely acronyms we hate, I was just hoping/wondering if any of you amazing ladies have ever had experience with getting the Chronic Endometritis diagnosis right in the middle of stimming.  I hate the idea of injecting $800 in drugs while i wait for a call back.  \n\nIs this cycle FUBAR?  Is there a possibility of moving forward and freezing anything that we're (albeit unlikely) to retrieve? \n\nThis may be more of a vent that anything, I just hate that my entire life seems to resolve around injecting myself with my life savings and the crippling anxiety associated with it.  I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread...and I hate the bitter and jealous person that I've become on this journey.  Every bit of further bad news just leads to complete and blubbery meltdowns. I'm sure the constant headaches (presumably due to the follistim) aren't helping.  \n\nWould it be totally out of line and crazy to ask for xanex?  I haven't touched it since a miscarriage one 2016, but I really feel like I'm losing my everloving mind.  I am an unlucky in that I am a seriously ugly crier.  When I cry, it shows on my face for days...so that's also lovely.  Or maybe I just need to buck the fuck up since I see that so many of you have been through so much more and continue to be productive members of society.\n\nSorry for the long and mostly incoherent post.

We started seriously considering IVF around August this year due to my diminishing reserve of eggs. We wanted to do IVF earlier but couldn't because we were at a shitty clinic for 2 months and that caused 2 months of precious time wasted. Now we're finally at a clinic where we aren't being ignored and though it's not perfect there all the time I'm happier with them so far. I'm grateful we're finally making progress. I'm counting down the days til we start. I'll be upset if we fail but I know that life has more to offer than motherhood. I'm not even sure how I feel right now about trying IVF more than once. Right now I just know I'd like to know I tried once at the very least.\nI've enjoyed lurking here because unlike other sites like What to expect, BabyCenter, etc. people here seem to tell it how it is with foul language.

It really rubs me the wrong way. Her whole line about \"A mature adult learns to process sadness and tolerate discomfort, and not punish others for it.\" might be true but i dont think it applies to infertility. Honestly this kinda pissed me off. \n\nhttp://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/11/childless-couple-vows-to-end-friendship-over-kids/\n\nThere's the link, but if you dont want to click, here's the jist. Basically the person writing for advice has a friend who dealt with infertility who doesn't want to be friends if the writer has children. I just think the answer was incredibly tactless and rude. Here's the response from the \"advice\" columnist.\n\n - \"I\u2019m going to try to draw a parallel. Many of my cohorts still have their parents (mine are gone now). This can make me feel both sad and jealous. But do I want my friends to share my orphaned state in order to relieve my own sadness? No. Do I sever the friendship because they are busy taking care of their elderly parents? No. A mature adult learns to process sadness and tolerate discomfort, and not punish others for it. Granted, babies have a way of turning their parents\u2019 world inside out. Friendships do shift and sometimes end as a result. If this couple wanted to, they could easily find fulfilling ways to have children in their lives, including developing important relationships with their friends\u2019 children. But they don\u2019t want this, probably for very complicated reasons. I hope you will be honest in your reaction: \u201cWhen you joke about or threaten our friendship over the issue of having kids, I don\u2019t know how to react.

I realize this is better than zero. We have been actively TTC since July \u201816 with not preventing since 2014, have tried several medicated cycles, RE discouraged IUI. \n\nAt MY insistence, I had my husband see the reproductive urologist at our fertility clinic. My RE seriously has some complex where she refuses to tell my husband his SA is anything but \u201ctotally normal!\u201d So I absolutely insisted he see the urologist against her recommendation based on all my factual damn independent research. \n\nAfter the urology visit, husband was positive for \u201clarge\u201d bilateral varicoceles, I wasn\u2019t at the appointment with him so I don\u2019t know the grade. Also his estridol and testosterone ratio was off. The urologist strongly recommended varicocele surgery, retest blood and possible clomid, sent a large in-writing recommendation of pros and cons, with a strong leniency to surgery because of the grade of his varicoceles and the fact that they were bilateral and he is low or borderline on all SA perimeters. She recommended also we see the RE and discuss it with her, then follow up back with the urologist. They\u2019re in the SAME CLINIC. \n\nI swear, we see the RE again today and she is literally rolling her eyes at everything the urologist said. \u201cVaricocele surgery doesn\u2019t work, and you are anovulatory and THAT is the problem\u201d. I\u2019ve literally told this woman at my last THREE appointments, I temp, with OPKs and CM checks and I\u2019ve only had two anovulatory cycles in the last 15 months. She is dead set his sperm is not the problem. I\u2019m so fucking frustrated. The entire year we have seen this RE, between two abysmal SAs, she\u2019s refuses to recommend anything but more Femara. She literally told me \u201cthe urologist doesn\u2019t see the entire picture\u201d. She hadn\u2019t even looked up the hormone results for my husband, she did it right in front of us. FUCK YOU!!!  She actually told me today \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you should ever have to do IVF. Give it time\u201d. It\u2019s been three years bitch! Is my RE seriously going to bingo me?!?\n\nGood news though, I\u2019m switching to an insurance plan that has a $50 IUI copay next year with no IUI limit. \n\nEdit: Progesterone that was drawn at appointment yesterday (at my request) came back confirming ovulation for this month.
