I've been stalking Reddit for a few months now and this forum is what's been keeping me sane.  IF is not something you talk about with your friends, and it is so good to know I am not alone in this, because it gets lonely.  And when I was freaking about my HSG, your posts reassured me it wasn't a big deal...and it wasn't.  \nAnyhow...full story, because it's time I get this off my chest and introduce myself.  Husband and I have been trying about a year and half. I'm 29, never pregnant, gluten intolerant. Just had my third RE appt today with the grand reveal of \"what's wrong with me\".  (Husband's SA at first appointment was totally normal). 2 weeks ago I had the HSG, sono, and endometrial biopsy done (yup...all in one day).  Biopsy showed that I have chronic endometritis (CE)...not be confused with endometriosis.  So starting 2 weeks of antibiotics for that in the morning. That's looking like a promising diagnosis since it looks like antibiotics clear it up 90% of the time. But then he said I also have PCOS.  High AMH, borderline high testosterone, acne issues, weak ovulation as per low progesterone levels day 21.  No cysts on my ovaries as per the sono which is a good thing. I am only 124 pounds, so it was a bit of a surprise to be in the 20% or so of \"lean\" PCOS ladies.  And considering my periods are usually on time to within a day and not that heavy.  Then we talked about my HSG, which showed that my tubes are open (yay!) but that my left one is \"abnormal\"...scarred or has a cyst.  Basically we need to do a laparoscopy for a conclusive answer.  And ideally do it when it's time to re-biopsy to check in the endometritis cleared up so I can get it all done at once.  \nNeedless to say, its a lot to take in. The lap terrifies me and I want to cancel it (it's on the schedule for January).  I had my wisdom teeth out in college and didn't come out of anesthesia well.  Swore I was never doing it again, and here I am looking at an even more invasive, intense procedure.  To add to the list, I found out last year I'm allergic to lidocaine.  And the year before that I found out I'm allergic to amoxicillin.  Both useful surgical drugs that I've had several times since my youth for minor stuff and not had reactions to before. So in my head I'm freaking out a bit about having a reaction to something else while I'm on the table. \n Which leads me to wonder how far down this path I'm willing to go for a child.  After the lap, what's next? Assuming they can even do anything about what's in there.  Drugs for the PCOS?  Then more fertility drugs?  Then are we looking at IUI or IVF?  My husband and I are both carriers for cystic fibrosis by the way, so even if I can get pregnant, 25% chance of a child with CF.  I have 2 cousins with the disease...I don't want that for my child but the only way to rule it out is IVF.  I have read many of your stories and I don't think I can handle the roller coaster of emotions with IVF.  I just never thought this would be our journey to get pregnant.  Its just starting to sink in of just how much I'm going to have to commit to go down this road. By the way, I'm a horse trainer running a farm.  I ride an average of 4 to 5 horses a day, mostly ones with some kind of behavior issue.  Not good ones to ride with a delicate pregnancy.  Asked doc about it today and he said point blank that if I do fertility drugs down the road I shouldn't ride until baby is born. So then I start thinking, can I really take off 9 months when I do get pregnant?  Just taking the week off for the lap is going to be hard.  I have to hire someone to do the barn work.  I should be able to teach as soon as I have my mental capacity, right? \nI guess my questions to all of you veterans out there are: \nHow long did you take off after laproscopy?  Did anyone regret doing it or was it worth it for the answers and/or what they could fix?\nAny other horse trainers/riders out there with IF?  How are managing taking off work?  Did you tell your clients you are taking off for fertility issues or what was your excuse?  If I do this I'm going to need an excuse.  I don't really want everyone knowing we are having issues, especially since only my mom and my sister even know we've been trying and we just told them. \n Are my doubts normal or are they a sign that I should not be going down this path? Especially with our risk of having a baby with CF?  \n Oh, and are there advantages to knowing more via the lap beyond just fertility reasons?  I've been reading stories about endoMETRIOSIS and that sounds like it would be nice to rule out for my own sake.  Celiac symptoms that I've been having seem to be linked to it, etc. \nThanks for reading if you made it through all this.  Just needed to get it all out. I hope my doubts don't offend anyone.  I know some of you are facing so much worse and will do anything for a child.

I recently joined reddit and this group but I\u2019ve been reading it (and some other TTC subreddits) for a few months. While the process of TTC has been a difficult one, it really has helped to hear from a lot of people here who are going through it too. Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and wealth of knowledge. It\u2019s been so helpful. :)\n\nBackground Info: I\u2019m a 30F (husband is 31M) and we\u2019re both research scientists in biotech. We\u2019ve been married for 5 years and decided to start TTC in January 2017. We\u2019re now 11 cycles in and no sign of a BFP, no sign of miscarriage. I\u2019m very slightly underweight and I always get monthly periods, though they do vary in length by ~3-5 days per month. I have a clean bill of health from my PCP. I\u2019ve done several months of OPKs (the blinking smiley ones, which yielded results that matched the phone app I\u2019m using) and we\u2019ve timed sex with these tests as well as cervical mucus. No luck so far! (and as a scientist, I'm super obsessed with details and optimizing things...)\n\nThe first few months were OK in terms of my attitude/optimism but I\u2019d say since around the 6 month mark I started feeling pretty down. I don\u2019t take pregnancy tests anymore (since probably the 4 month mark). It seems like as soon as everyone turned 30, social media exploded with pregnancy and birth announcements. My husband and I have been together for over 10 years and people have been wondering/saying \u2018you\u2019re next.\u2019 Little do they know how hard we\u2019ve been trying! Additionally, my work environment is fantastic and wonderfully supportive of work-life balance and having families. The downside is that there are a lot of pregnant women at all times\u2014a constant reminder of our lack of success. The good side of all of it is, I\u2019ve been very fortunate that my husband is incredibly supportive and we\u2019re still doing great. While my family is very supportive and close-knit, my husband and I don\u2019t really feel comfortable discussing this situation with them or any of our friends so this whole thing has been incredibly isolating.\n\nMy questions: \nI know everyone says you need to wait 1 year to be seen by a doctor. I saw my PCP 3 months ago (I was at the 8 cycle mark) and she seemed completely unconcerned and said to contact an OB sometime in the winter if no BFP (she wasn't very helpful and didn't have much info to offer). I\u2019ve never seen an OB/GYN before because my PCP always does my pap etc. and I\u2019ve never had cause for concern. When I was younger (more underweight) my periods were more irregular so I thought I was doing pretty well these days in terms of my cycle (but maybe not!).\n\nI was thinking of contacting an OB soon for an appointment. I presume you need to see an OB before you see an RE? What requirements might they have before referring you to an RE? I feel like I have a tendency to have my concerns brushed aside by doctors so I wondered if anyone had any advice on solid things to say/info to provide that might get things moving along?\n\nUpdated post: I have cycles varying in length from 28 to 33 days but always periods 5 days long. I have never used hormonal birth control. ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New to the group.

Although I'm still in the TWW of this sixth and final IUI, I have my WTF appointment with the RE next week. Before that, I'd like to be sure I've thoroughly thought through all the next step options, and discussed them with MrP. So I hoped I could pick all of your collective brains :)\n\nOur diagnosis is slight MFI + unexplained/oligoovulation, although I've been ovulating normally and regularly on Clomid. I'm 37, and my AMH was 3.45 ng/mL and day 3 FSH was 5.5 uIU/mL. MrP is 44, and had variable SA results of between 5 and 19 million total motile count. We've been considered good candidates for IUI, hence six attempts. But so far, zilch.\n\nHere's where I'm at:\n\n**We pursue IVF here, at UCSF or another clinic.**\n- Pay out of pocket. SF Bay Area has highest IVF costs in the country. Our current insurance covers $0. UCSF average cash cost is around $24K per round including meds. Most couples do at least two rounds.\n- Petition MrP's employer to cover IVF in benefits package (I'm self-employed and on his insurance). Not sure about how long this will take, nor what/how much insurance will cover. Most insurers give a lifetime cap to fertility treatments.\n- Get a job with better insurance, including infertility coverage (me or MrP)\n\n**Mini-IVF or INVOcell**\nWhere - which clinics? Lower dose of ovarian stimulating meds, so lower cost. Also lower success rate. \n\n**IVF in Australia** (I'm an Aust citizen, US permanent resident)\n- Pay out of pocket/private/international rate. $12-15K in Sydney, not sure of price in my hometown, where we could stay with family.\n- Re-enroll in (Australian) Medicare. Requires some paperwork shuffling, including proof of residence, e.g., rental or employment contract in Australia. Around $4K/cycle. Potentially possible to pay out of my Aus superannuation fund. Note: we don't want to move permanently to Australia at this point, although we might in the next 5+ years.\n- Buy private health insurance in Aust. 12 month waiting period before they'd pay out for any ART.\n\n**IVF elsewhere in the US**\n- Shop around for cheaper clinics, + travel/accom. New Directions in Phoenix is $5K+ meds\n\n**IVF elsewhere in the world**\nMexico, Greece, Czech, etc. $3Kish + travel/accom, etc.\n\n**Keep doing IUIs** sigh. This really doesn't appeal at this point. And I've taken a fair amount of Clomid.\n\n**Stop treatment, try to conceive naturally** for a year? two? the rest of our reproductive lives? Stress, higher potential of genetic anomalies as we age, etc.\n\n**Stop treatment, ask my twin sister to be our surrogate/egg donor.** (she's offered in the past). Home AI or IUI?\n\n**Stop treatment, stop trying.** Live childfree. Pursue adoption/other. Obviously, this is its own big can of worms, and a very personal decision for us to make.\n\nHave I missed anything? I'd really appreciate any input.

If this is in error, I apologize.\n\nWe have been dealing with a postponed FET due to a thin lining, we tried viagra which actually reduced the lining, but it started to bounce back.  It seems  that estrogen blood levels have stopped climbing, and now dropped off sharply, which may be part of the reason the rebound has stalled out.\n\nThe NP seems to feel this is normal fluctuation due to absorption vaginally.  My wife and I are not so sure.  We saw a drop off of nearly 75% in blood levels while shes taking the same dosage at the same time.\n\n**day, e2, p4**\n\n* CD1 39/.63\n\n* CD7 562/.31\n\n* CD10 950/.39\n\n* CD12 813/.42\n\n* CD14 1252/.75\n\n* CD17 1582/.99\n\n* CD19 1103/.51\n\n* CD21 449/.35\n\nAs you can see, it built pretty regularly, but then seems to have dropped off inexplicably.  My wife is taking 2mg three times per day vaginally.  It seems that my wife's lining responds a little bit better during peak e2 during stim cycles, reaching as high as 9 or 10mm at 2500+ e2 levels.   Our doctor said normally they only need e2 to be above 200, but was willing to allow it to continue to climb if she responded well.  But we are concerned the drop off is leading to the stalled lining growth, or recovery if you will.\n\nToday was supposed to be do or die for this months cycle, but because of t he low e2 number, and close lining numbers (7.2 homogeneous), we are going to add 2 patches to the mix, and see where that gets us by monday. \n\nAt least at that point, we will know we've done just about everything we can, and pumped my poor wife sky high full of estrogen.  If her lining still wont respond to high e2 numbers, our next attempt will be completely different, as we will likely try a Natural FET (or simply sit one out if the numbers dont come up).\n\nAnyway, my wife's perseverance is really astounding.  Aside from the needles and early morning appointments, shes been willing to ingest any and every hormone or medication they can throw at her, and she takes it all in stride.  I really cant say shes been moody / emotional / angry or anything out of the ordinary.  Perhaps the doctors just severely underestimate the drug metabolizing capacity of an irish liver. :)   (joking of course)\n\nBack on topic, is the drop off something to be concerned about?

That said, here goes:\n\nAfter 5 failed IUIs, plus a cancelled injectables cycle, then a year-long wait, no pregnancies ever, am finally in the middle of funded IVF. During monitoring I was showing 20ish follicles. At retrieval? Over 30 eggs. Day 2 result is showing 24 fertilized, most ICSI, some IVF. (All-freeze to avoid OHSS.) Going by the Hunger Games (which I've been reading religiously) and this morning's phone conversation with the embryologist, this is a) a lot, and b) while anything's possible, a sign that a lot might make it to Day 5. \n\nSo. Prior to starting this process, my partner and I met with a genetic counselor at the RE, and learned that PGS involves paying a few hundred dollars per embryo. I'd asked during that meeting what to do if there's some absurd number of embryos, and they didn't see this as a plausible. And yet, here we are, or might be be. The total cost could be anything up to $10,000 out-of-pocket, for what is ostensibly a funded cycle. Or it could be zero, if nothing makes it to day 5, but the possibility of spending $10,000, all of a sudden (or so it feels), without any guarantee the issue isn't (say) implantation, is there, and we'll need to decide how to proceed in the day or so. \n\nI'm wondering whether anyone has been in a situation like this, and what you did in this case. Give a cap of how many embryos (10-12, say) to test, then freeze the rest? Make peace with having no money? Figure if there are a lot, that gives us time, and not test at all? We have... other factors, clearly, but nothing that would make PGS specifically applicable in our case. Any thoughts/advice appreciated. \n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you all for the suggestions, this has been incredibly helpful, and hopefully also helpful to others who may wind up in this boat. Day 3 results are exactly the same - 24 all looking as they should, with 2 that are a bit slower. I'm of course cautiously happy about that result - it just means I am still trying to sort this out. I checked and unfortunately my RE's office does not allow biopsying without PGS - that is, it's not possible to freeze biopsied cells, as there's nowhere to store them. So the options are back where they were: all, nothing, or picking a cap (12 maybe) and freezing the rest w/out testing.

I started estrace with my next cycle to prepare for a FET. I ended up having an LH surge along with a lining that was only about 5mm thick. So we cancelled. Fast forward to the next cycle where we went with estrace and lupron (to prevent the LH surge) and my lining just wasn't thickening. I think the highest it's been was around 5mm. We added in estrogen patches and vaginal viagra. Nothing. My lining was only 4.6mm. So we cancelled again.\n\nWe went ahead and did a hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy and found some endometritis. Thankfully this was fixable with antibiotics--but would put us at the next cycle. So we still haven't even reached the point to transfer. \n\nThis cycle we are completely switching up the protocol. My RE said that I am one of the few women who just don't respond to artificial estrogen and my body would rather make its own. I had a good thick lining when on stims, she said it would have been perfect for a transfer. This week we started 125 of follistem to let my body make its own estrogen. We will adjust/add meds as needed just like we would if we were preparing for an egg retrieval. \n\nHas anyone else done a cycle like this to prepare for a FET?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Stimming for FET", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7h697d/stimming_for_fet/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "Reepicheepee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "32, 2.5 yrs, unexp, 4 failed IUIs, FET #1 fail", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1512260093, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1512269135, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7h6doq/fet_2_failure_total_ivf_bust/", "id": "7h6doq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 50, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7h6doq/fet_2_failure_total_ivf_bust/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1512349732, "score": 22, "selftext": "Fuck me, right?

Was put on 25mcg of synthroid and returned after 6 weeks for another blood test. TSH went down to 2.5 which is in the \"normal\" range but still no sign of a period. Doctor upped my dosage to 50mcg of synthroid, I was asking about a progesterone shot or seeing a specialist because its incredibly frustrating when you want to have a baby but you physically cannot because your body just isn't working and producing hormones. I have been on the new dose for just over a week and I'm sitting here PRAYING I get my period soon.

We have decided to keep the downvote option on. This is for a few of reasons: \n\n1) Even if downvotes are turned off, users who access the sub via mobile or Reddit Enhancement Suite will still have the option to downvote. We want all users to be on an equal playing field. \n\n2) There are other ways to downvote a comment or thread. If someone wants to downvote you badly enough, they will. \n\n3) Voting serves a function. A downvote says \"You are giving bad advice\" or \"this comment is inappropriate for our sub.\" (Reminder that if a post breaks our rules, hit the report button to let the mods know!) A downvote is NOT supposed to be used in the case of disagreement. An upvote says \"this is good advice,\" \"I'm entertained by what you said,\" \"this is good information that I've never heard before,\" etc.\n\n/r/infertility currently has 7,000+ subscribers. We have 2,000+ unique viewers to our sub every day with over 15,000 page views per day. Our contributors (and lurkers) are what makes this sub so great. Participation, even in the form of voting, improves the quality of the sub. When looking at comment replies to a thread, generally speaking the user with the best advice has the most upvotes. Moral of the story is UPVOTE to provide support to those who take the time to share their knowledge and those who ask great questions.\n\nOn another note in regard to posts by new users - we were all newbies at one point. If you feel like a question is \"too basic\" for our sub, feel free to (politely) point them in the right direction to one of our sister subs or frankly, just answer the question. If you don't have the emotional energy to deal with a new poster, move on but please don't downvote. We do not want to scare off new contributors because their posts are downvoted into oblivion.\n\nThanks everyone for being awesome and keeping the dialogue open on our sub!

Now that I'm actually going through it, most of the people I talk to seem to think it's no big deal. \n\nI've got local family (both cousins have small children..youngest is 1yr old) that ask how things are and then they're like, \"that's neat.. So my baby just started talking! Look how cute!!\"\n\n\nI have a friend who lives out of state (16 hr drive) and she gets really passive aggressive that I don't come and visit her more often (I come down about twice a year to visit her and family). I'm over here with a maxed out credit card because IVF is expensive duh and no money to spend on a plane ticket or gas to get to CA. She likes to complain about her kids to me when I talk to her on the phone.\n\n\nI have another cousin from CA that actually has gone to 2 of my dr appts with me where they were explaining procedure and cost. Still continues to ask me to come visit him all the time (very persistent and gets mad when I decline). I tell him my financial situation and he says, \"nah your husband has an awesome job! You guys can totally afford it!\" I'm not exaggerating. Same cousin asked me last month to CANCEL one of my appointments so I could help him and his wife move from CA to ID. Told him no obviously. He got mad and said I was making excuses and didn't see why I couldn't just reschedule my appt for the following week. \n\n\nSo I don't really expect or need all the attention to be on us the whole time we're doing IVF, but I did expect people to be a little more sympathetic and back the hell off a little. And then there's all the mood swings in between from hormones and I'm over here feeling super overwhelmed because it feels like everyone expects all these things from me and I can't give them anything right now. Fuck that. I stopped using emojis in my texts and my Facebook wall is as barren as me right now. \n\nI have my husband, my mom, my best friend, and you guys. That's more than some people have so at least I can be grateful for that.\n\n\n\n\n\ntldr: \nMy friends and family are super selfish and suck at sympathy.

I guess the theory was that the high FSH was in part due to egg quality, and that Ubiquinol could help improve the quality.\n\nThis month, FSH came back at 14 - which is still higher than we'd like, but within range to proceed with an IUI cycle by my clinic's standards. \n\nFor this cycle, the doctor asked that I switch to the supplement DHEA - which is fine.  However, I'm wondering about something the fertility nurse stated: that I should stop the Ubiquinol, as it could interfere with the effectiveness of DHEA.\n\nEverything I've read here and around Dr. Google seems to indicate that they are fine, and often recommended, to be taken together.  Obviously I'd like to do the best I can to improve the quality of my eggs as we go through this process.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone in this lovely community has any experience or wisdom on the subject?\n\n**TL;DR** - fertility nurse says DHEA and Ubiquinol should not be taken together - Internet says the opposite.

I have a few embryos left so if I went through with a transfer next and it failed I wouldn't have to re-cycle so very lucky for that but as we all know failure is a lot of emotional baggage.

One RE said the polyp is small and probably wouldn't interfere with implantation and so to go with the ERA because that's more likely to be the issue.\n\n2.) The other RE said polyps are far more documented as having issues with the ERA is relatively new. So his advice would be to do a hysteroscopy and skip the ERA.\n\n3.)
