I was wondering if anyone has any experience looking at ultrasounds and could clarify the anatomy for me? \n\nSorry for the crappy pics but it\u2019s all I have, the 2 air bubbles are left of the green cursor. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/m6BuYO0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16330, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bad feeling after FET w/ US images", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/evxg74/bad_feeling_after_fet_w_us_images/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "paintupastorm86", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_507lkabk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580352264, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/evybf9/how_to_support_a_friend/", "gildings": {}, "id": "evybf9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/evybf9/how_to_support_a_friend/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1580352266, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone, I am looking for some advice.

Prior to starting this cycle, my doctor and I discussed adding an HCG booster to my semi-natural FET prep, as there is evidence that the HCG can help with implantation. \n\nThe plan we settled on was to come off birth control, and not start PIO until 6 days prior to transfer, and add estrogen and the HCG booster. \n\nAt my last ultrasound and bloodwork appointment on Tuesday, no one mentioned the HCG trigger shot, only that I would start PIO the following day to align with my ERA recommended window of 125 hours. I was also told to start oral Estrace. \n\nMy lining on Tuesday was trilaminar and measured at 7.25, which the doctor said was great. My estrogen levels were rather low, having decreased from 113 on 1/20 to 99 on 1/28. Progesterone was .02 and .03 respectively. These levels seems odd to me, on the low end of the ranges for ovulation phase. \n\nI called the IVF coordinator today to ask about the HCG trigger and was told the doctor vetoed using it since he deems my lining and levels are fine. \n\nThis goes against what we previously discussed, and I\u2019m confused. I also greatly distrust the IVF nurse; she has given me incorrect information several times and never really seems to know what she\u2019s talking about. But she said that was doctor\u2019s orders and I\u2019m not sure about it to be honest. I don\u2019t trust that she actually spoke to him. \n\nI really am not pleased to be skipping the HCG shot. \n\nSo, asking about rogue protocols. If I wanted to secretly take the trigger shot, when would be the right time? I\u2019ve had two doses of PIO (1.5cc) already. I haven\u2019t been keeping track of my temps or LH surge because they told me not to bother. \n\nHas anyone used HCG in a semi-natural FET and if so, when did you trigger? \n\nI don\u2019t necessarily want to go against doctor orders, but at no point was it communicated to me that my own hormones would determine whether it would be used. \n\nI obviously want this transfer to work, and go into with the intended kitchen-sink approach. \n\nThoughts?

Bad news this am on my husband's SA. I have the results and numbers in my bag, but the doc (primary care doc) said the count is low, the quality is very low and they're 'not really moving'. The end of the report says 'oligoasthenozoospermia - suitable for ICSI only'. We were told this after going through my bloods and HyCoSy result in detail - despite knowing in advance that they were all fine. She was stalling. She spent ages on my vit D which is normal but slightly suboptimal for fertility. I'll take supplements, but this isn't why we can't conceive. \n\nWe have really only been trying in earnest for 6 months. Nine if you count the careless few months before our proper 'let's do this, let's temp and track and bang it out' start date last August. I decided to push for an SA at 6 months as my husband has a varicocele which we were told might, miiiight impact fertility. \n\nOur doc took some more bloods today - a repeat progesterone from me post ovulation, hormone profile on my husband - and she has also referred us onto a reproductive urologist. She more or less said that she didn't think he could do much as the result was so poor, but that it was worth a try. The doc who initially diagnosed the varicocele said they weren't worried that it would affect fertility (that was years ago) and the consultant radiologist who did my HyCoSy also said they hadn't known varicoceles to be a major cause of MFI, and where there was suboptimal SA with varicoceles there was very little evidence to show that surgery improved things.\n\nI now feel pulled between exhausting this (varicocelectomy, iced balls, extra lifestyle changes etc) and getting the ball rolling with IVF/ICSI. If we spend months and months fucking around with repeat SAs and feeling guilty over every coffee and beer etc and then still end up facing into IVF and all that I have heard it brings... Conversely if this RU can do something to help improve sperm quality I feel we would be remiss to jump straight to ART. Or would we be best to pursue both? Better chances with ART with improved sperm quality? \n\nMy thoughts at the moment (just a few hours after our appointment so it's all very fresh but I'm a planner) are to proceed with both paths - make initial inquiries with the fertility clinic and go see RU person. I suppose I came here looking for insight and direction, or maybe just to get these thoughts down. I'm in the middle of a two week wait. I remembered that earlier and didn't know whether to laugh or cry. \n\nIf I'm in the wrong place as we have not been trying over 12 months please let me know and I'll move along. Should this go in TFAB? Bit lost. Hiding at the back of a work meeting, yet grateful to be in work as I've had to keep my shit together. Also worried for my poor sweet husband, who I know will be tough on himself about this. I told him as soon as we left the appointment that this is an *us* issue, yet he still keeps apologising. The thought that he is being so tough on himself is shittiest of all.

IVF is next for us to help control for genetics but we're worried uterus is also an issue. Has anyone had a similar experience with RPL and actually gone on to have a healthy pregnancy that goes the distance?\n\n2. We've done a semen analysis, carrier panels, full karyotypes, hsg, sis testing before this m/c. In my second pregnancy I started showing myometrial cysts out of nowhere so we are wondering if adenomyosis is also at play. \nCurrent plan: testing on embryo, infectious disease culture, clotting panel, MRI, receptiva, create embryos and do genetic testing, another SIS, hysteroscopy.

Turns out I have a small epididymal cyst which my doc says never goes away.

He doesn\u2019t know if the cyst is the reason but I\u2019m reading mixed information on that fact. I would also like to do another SA as the one I did I think was tested just over 1 hour after collection, don\u2019t know if that would effect the sperm in this way? It was also collected at home and driven to the lab in cold weather. The thing that won\u2019t stop going through my mind is, what am I doing wrong to cause this? How did I even get this cyst?? I\u2019m genuinely healthy, 205 5\u201911\u2019\u2019 I don\u2019t smoke or use marijuana. I do drink regularly but keep it within the (higher-ish) limits.

This is my first post here (or ever) but have been lurking on all of your very helpful and supportive posts, comments, etc. I absolutely would be lost and panicked without you all!\n\nA quick intro on our situation is we tried for 12 months using opks, have good CM, using Ava temping with zero positive pregnancy tests. Zilch. Husband's SA results are wonderful. My complete RE workup is excellent aside from low progesterone. I have suspected endo, had an IUD put in to ease the pain, which worked for it's five years, but I never had a lap. I'm 1.5 years without the Mirena and my cycle was normal within 60 days of having it removed. \n\nI'm currently on my first medicated cycle, which is a monitored clomid-IUI cycle, with 50mg CD 3-7. My CD 11 US this morning was \"textbook.\" Dominant ovary has three well developing follicles (19mm, 17mm, 14mm) and my other ovary is laying low. Great, double layer lining (I think she said double?) at 8.5 (mm? I can't recall the units). My complex cysts from CD 2 US are cleared. \n\nAwesome, right?  I'm so grateful I'm responding well to clomid! But for me, the best coping method is to not get my hopes up. I went from expecting IUI to be a waste (low success rates), to feeling slightly more optimistic reading several recent peer reviewed articles of studies with unexplained infertility and clomid-IUI (w/ trigger) with pretty solid success rates, AND several review articles supporting medicated IUI. \n\nSo I ask you for personal experiences that may be similar as far as \"looking great!!\" leading up to IUI, at any stage, but the IUI failed. It would greatly help me stay focused at work today \ud83d\ude02.\n\nP.S. If, on the other hand you have a success story I won't turn you away \ud83d\ude09\n\nIn case my flair isn't working (as usual) I am 32 yo, with 33 right around the corner. Trying for #1.

The advice from our RE was to stop the progesterone once menses occurs. 14 days later and there was no sign of menses so we took a home pregnancy test 2 days in a row and both clearly negative. We went in for a blood test the day after which also came back undetectable for HCG (&lt;1). Still no sign of menses so we took another blood test 2 days later to confirm and it was once again completely negative. At this point the RE had us stop the progesterone.\n\nDay after stopping the progesterone wife experienced mild spotting/dark old blood more akin to the last day or so of menses. She also had no period pains. Her usual period is very heavy with clots and very painful. After 2 and a half days the spotting has stopped and we\u2019re at a bit of a loss as to what to do next.

A few things I've been using to cope includes Reddit, counseling, and spending time with a specific group of friends. I moved to a small city in 2014 and met a few gals around my age that were either dating seriously or newly wed like myself. Eventually we turned into a little group of girlfriends. \n\nA weird coincidence about our group was that all four of us ended up with infertility problems. Not everyone was trying when we first met either, so it became something that bonded us even more. We would exchange doctor's advice, check on one another, and joke about our uncooperative reproductive systems. We started to call ourselves \"ugly ovaries\" to try to make light of it all.\n\nWhen the first of us got pregnant we were all happy for her because it was still early on and it gave us hope. However, when she recently announced her second pregnancy all three of us were in a totally different head space - we clearly had been hurting for too long and lost a lot of that hope. I hadn't been in a good place for other people's pregnancies for a while, but I was surprised with my lack of joy for that friend.\n\nOut of these girls there is one I'm closest to. She's my best friend, hands down, and she's been trying almost as long as me. It's great - even our husbands are best friends, and we spend a ton of time together. After my 5th FET with two remaining blasts, I decided I needed a break. My best friend also decided to take a break a few months later because of complicated reasons. She started taking birth control on October, so we were completely thrown off when she discovered she was pregnant. And like really pregnant, like 16 weeks in.\n\nShe wrote me a letter last week to tell me, and I had no idea that it would have the effect it had on me. I was broken up. Of course this was something that could happen, and we talked about what it would be like if either of us got pregnant, but it was much more intense than I expected. My first thought was, \"It's over. Our friendship won't survive this,\" and I cried over my own uncooperative body and the idea of losing her friendship. It took me days to even consider there's another possibility.\n\nAfter a week I felt like I was ready to talk to her. I came to the conclusion that being a passive observer of her pregnancy and baby would eat me alive, so I would either need a TON of space... or, if she wanted me, I would want to be there every step of the way. I may never be able to have kids: my one sister, who lives across the country, doesn't want kids; my husband's sister, who also lives very far away, is unlikely to want much of my involvement if she ever has kids. This might be my one chance to be in a child's life.\n\nSo I shared this idea with her, and I was so afraid of sounding nuts and the possibility of rejection. Instead, she started tearing up saying she was really hoping I would be involved. She said she was scared and didn't want to do it alone, and that she felt like she needed me, but was afraid I would hurt too much. I'm sure there will be some hurt along the way, but I'm so happy that we can need and have one another right now.\n\nI have been so trapped by grief.

My AMH isn't super either: 5.6 in European numbers. \n\nLastly, the UC doctor wants to put me on biological treatment for 6 months before I do more IVF.\n\nAny thoughts on this? Is there any benefit to egg quality or EC numbers if I wait until I'm well? PGS testing here takes six weeks, which is why I'm wondering about getting a head start.\n\n(Sorry, that was a lot!

I'd like to properly introduce myself, though I must admit that I'm quite the lurker. I'm 33 this February, and my infertility journey has been a lot different than most. \n\nI want to introduce my self because it's my hope this subreddit can be a greater source of comfort, as well as a safe place to express my feelings. As I know you ladies have been through a lot, and I know you will understand my heart. \n\nSo, to the details. I was married for 2 yrs, 5.5 years together total. We tried for two years straight. And when I say try I mean passionately tried. All the tricks and tips, temping and planning, the works. For nothing. Its morbid, but I'd have even been happy for a miscarriage, just to know I at least could get pregnant. Then my life turned upside down completely. Two months after my second wedding anniversary, my husband killed himself. The ultimate devastation. Hind sight is 20/20 and looking back from where I am now I can see the red flags, I can see the relationship plainly. I was 27 then. Who imagines being widowed at 27?\n\nI was broken. A mess. Totally and completely, but I've put myself back together again. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but I am a better person now than I ever was before. I actually have self love now. I didn't want to waste time finding someone who dreamed of a family as much as myself because I already knew it would be hard to get pregnant. It's been 4 years since my husband died.\n\nOf course a small part of me thought, maybe it was my husband all along. Despite his sperm tests being fine. But now I have met a person who just completes me. He's a total gem. I completely adore him and we're engaged. We've been together for 3.5yrs. My life is perfect with him, everything I could ask for in a relationship, I have with him. I'm just so in love and am truly so lucky that someone loves me as much as he does. And then here I am now with another solid year of infertility under my belt and my heart is just broken.\n\nThis time around I've been more relaxed, carefree. How many times have we heard \"oh just stop worrying so much and it will just happen for you!\" I completely embodied that idea. A mind set of \"it'll happen this time.\" And then 6months hit and I shift into \"I've been through this before, dust off the knowledge, and shoot for the every other day baby dance.... okay now maybe temping? No, okay well soon yeah?\" And yet today as I get my 12th period I find myself a sobbing mess.\n\nI just don't know anymore ladies.... my heart is so full of despair, and yeah I know I still have time... but I don't really. Not like last time. I don't really have the same freedom now in terms of time. I've always dreamed of two kids, and being not too old of a mom as my kids grow up. That's all getting harder to visualize realistically now. I don't even care about two now. Having just one would be a dream come true.\n\nI spent an hour just crying on my couch this evening. I have to let these feelings out and yet I fear my own feelings are self sabotaging. Like if I let myself feel dispare then it really wont happen for me. I don't know what's right any more. I'm about two shakes of a lamb's tail from black witch craft, speaking with the devil, talking to mama voodoo, ANYTHING to know what the future means for me as a mother.\n\nIt doesn't help that my entire lifes career for the past 10 yrs has been raising people's children. Going from a preschool teacher to a day care provider. My entire world is surrounded by babies and pregnant woman. I share in their joy, and adore their children. I truly love them. I LOVE my job, and it is an asset to my future as a mother. I would get free child care and have the opportunity to go to work with my child, raise them in a community of wonderful families I know and care so much about. I can't even entertain the thought of quiting in the name of redusing pressure to make a baby, because I can't let go of what potential the job has for me. Not to mention it's a business I've helped start from the ground up. I don't know how I could remake my lifes work and make ends meet?\n\nI don't know how to end this vent, but there are all my cards. Maybe this is a cry just to be heard and felt. All of the women in my life mean well, but I can't hear \"Just be patient, itll happen for you. - You'll be an amazing mom. - We're all so excited for you!! - I can't wait till you have kids. - Omg I hope they have your hair/eyes. - You guys are just the perfect couple, I know you'll be amazing parents. - You two are meant to have kids. - I'm rooting for you!\" All the time. It fills me with this fleeting positivity. Like my dreams just beam out of their faces, and it feels so comforting to look into their smiling faces. But when I turn around from them the cold reality sets in. Despaire seeps in and chokes me like poison. \n\nAnd here I am.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16402, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "An introduction", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/exz665/an_introduction/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "questionshere123", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5de1849t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580694121, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/exz830/ivf_drugs_overseas/", "gildings": {}, "id": "exz830", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/exz830/ivf_drugs_overseas/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1580694121, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am planning to freeze my eggs but will likely have to do two, if not three, cycles to get the number I want.

Does your health insurance increase your ability to pay for those services? How do you afford the high cost of infertility services when health insurance is not accessible, or does not cover all of the costs? Do you have to travel long distances or move residence to access infertility services?\n\nI am interested in hearing about your experience. People who I would like to hear from are:\n\n* U.S. citizens (including naturalized citizens)\n* Men and Women age 18-65\n* Individuals and couples looking for, currently using, or previously used infertility services (including, but not limited to, surrogacy, infertility testing, use of hormone treatments, IVF, and other assisted reproduction methods)\n\nParticipation in this research includes:\n\n* 10 min survey: Context of Infertility Insurance Mandates ([https://qtrial2015az1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_9Ys92qZtyRnKox7](https://qtrial2015az1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9Ys92qZtyRnKox7))\n* 15 min interview about your experience accessing infertility services\n   * An interview request is located at the end of the survey\n   * $30 Amazon gift card for completing the survey *and* interview\n\nBenefits of this research:\n\n* State policies for infertility services insurance are still being developed, so this is a way to help inform new and current policies to increase financial accessibility to infertility services\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNathanael Stanley \n\nnbs@usf.edu", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 16408, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Infertility Services and Health Insurance (U.S. Citizens +18)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ey7nn2/infertility_services_and_health_insurance_us/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580750446, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eyadvg/monday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eyadvg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 124, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/eyadvg/monday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1580750447, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!\n\nUse this thread to share things that are NOT specific to treatment.

I want to check if my fallopian tubes are clear but my OBGYN clearly doesn't want to, even though I specifically asked about it...not to mention the words 'you guys are so young' comes up multiple times at each appointment.\n\nMy partner's SA results came back with some concerning numbers in my opinion:\n\n86 million total sperm\n\n56% progressive motility\n\n1% morphology (CASA)\n\n4% DNA fragmentation\n\nHowever, the vitality test showed that only 33% of the sperm were alive leaving us with 13 million total motile sperm. I'm not sure if only 1% of those sperm are 'normally shaped' or if the 1% is referring to the 86 million. Either way, I think it is very concerning but the urologist/andrologist diagnosis says 'mild subfertility' and to take some expensive vitamins and twiddle our thumbs for 3 more months.\n\nWe were really hoping to get going with an IUI cycle but of course, my OBGYN is not interested in doing anything. Our 14 cycles TTC are nothing compared to what many couples go through, but I'm feeling so drained and I think we are good candidates for IUI. Plus I don't want to waste three months only to find out nothing has changed. It just seems like we are being blown off even though there seems to be a problem with the SA.
