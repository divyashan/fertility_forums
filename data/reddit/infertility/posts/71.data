Since insurance requires a referral and medical records need to be sent, etc I\u2019m starting early so I can hopefully avoid unnecessary delays. \n\nI do have insurance coverage so I\u2019m limited somewhat by that in terms of which clinics and REs are in network (always weird when only 1 or 2 of many are in-network at the same clinic!) I also live in the Providence area and commute to Boston for work daily so there are a variety of logistical challenges that will inform our ultimate choice, including the location of a clinic\u2019s embryology lab/where they do retrievals and transfers. \n\nI\u2019m also particularly interested to hear from anyone who has done PGS at a Boston area clinic and what PGS testing lab was used for those results (and cost!) My current clinic doesn\u2019t really push PGS testing and is on the smaller side and at the end of the day while I like them I\u2019m a little cautious that their embryology staff has less experience biopsying embryos than a larger clinic where more patients do PGS. I\u2019ve also never heard of the lab they use for PGS testing which gives me pause. \n\nThanks in advance for anyone who is willing to share, and if you\u2019d rather not discuss your location on the public board please feel free to PM me!

My first post (I read the rules three times), so please be patient as I try to do this right.

Here you have the option of posting the outcome of your cycle (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread has now been combined with the Weekly Post-Beta Concerns &amp; Discussion. For a whole week this thread will be posted for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, your pregnancy announcement is allowed in this thread, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.\n\nMaybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.\n\n**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&amp;C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.\n\nFor a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).\n\n**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top \"Read This\" sticky on the main page.** For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, r/InfertilityBabies.

I had an FET in November, tested 8dp5dt and was told on the phone it was a negative. I asked the nurse if it could be due to testing so early and was there any chance continuing the medication and testing a couple of days later would change anything. She said no, there was no chance. According to conversations with my doctor, clinic policy is testing 10-14dp5dt, but the nurses scheduled mine on a Friday at 8dp5dt.\n\nI've had 4 pregnancy tests with them, the first 3 the number was 0. I assumed the fourth one was the same, but I saw yesterday it was actually 2.4. I know that's incredibly freaking low, but if they consider a 5 at 10dp5dt a positive in their lab, should they not have given me the opportunity to continue meds and retest a few days later?

Here is my story on why i think i need a new doctor. Or maybe im wrong and i know nothingg. Sorry if this is long. Summarized at the end if too much detail.\n\nI was diagnosed with stage 4 Endometriosis on 12/17. I missed 2 periods in a row,  went to my general doctor and she ordered an ultrasound which would reveal a cyst on each ovary. She suspected Pcos and sent me to a specialist. Now this specialist was super amazing we sat down and talked, and in the end he came up with Endo and scheduled a lap. Surgery day came and revealed it was indeed in his words \"The worse case of endo he has seen in a person as young as me\". (I was 23 now 24) I was shocked because i didn't really have any of the symptoms except irregular periods and infertility. (Note: I have never tried to conceive but there were times when i think back and say \"i should have definitely gotten pregnant by now\") \n\nI went to my post-op and we talked treatment plans till he could go back in and clear it out. He put me on a monthly shot of Depo Provera. After the surgery and the start of the injections I start having daily cramps like im on my period 24/7. I let him know and his answer for that is basically that \"we made the endo mad by going inside and moving things around\". 4 months later he went back in and cut everything out. This time he told me my ovaries were damage from the cysts and endo. He knows i want to try to conceive in the future, so of course im freaking out and wanting to know where we go from here. He suggests Lupron because his treatment plan is to stop my periods all together and stop anymore tissue from forming. And i give it a try because the pain was so bad i would try anything. WORST. DECISION. EVER. It made me feel like i was dying and the pain and periods never went away. He took me off of it after 3months at my request and put me on daily Norethindrone tablets. Which also do not stop the pain or bleeding. I ask him if im gonna have to have a surgery again and he says \"i dont want to do anymore surgeries on you till you want to try and conceive.\" He basically just wants to keep doing trial and error with me till i find a birth control that stops my periods. At this point im frustrated and have been off any birth control or treatments for 2 months now.\n\nNow while this is going on my mother is also having problems with her uterus. We have different Gynos so i decided to go to one of her appointments. I basically tell this doctor everything that i just wrote here. She tells me that if my ovaries are damaged and i want to get pregnant, my doctor should have been sending me to a infertility specialist to talk about saving my eggs and ways to keep everything down there working properly WHILE we figure out how to stop new tissue from growing. Because we could be causing more damage while going through all these treatments and gave me the whole clock is ticking speech. \n\nNow I'm confused on what steps to take next. Should I go back to my current doctor and ask to be referred to see a infertility specialist alongside of him? Or just find a new team all together? \n\nSUMMARY: I have Endometriosis and damaged ovaries. My current doctor knows I want to conceive in the near future but only wants to focus on controlling the scar tissue with multiple trial and error treatments and then focus on conceiving later when I'm 100% sure I'm ready. Second opinion doctor says my current doc should have been sending me to a infertility specialist to save my eggs and talk about my options on conceiving just in case he can't stop new scar tissue from forming and makes my ovaries worse.

In the past 12 months, my wife and I have had 2 miscarriages. The first one happened a little after 8 weeks, and the second one was a blighted ovum.\n\nI had a semen analysis performed to see if there was anything that I needed to address.\n\nAlthough the analysis was mostly normal, the results show that I have \u201cvery mild esthonnospermia.\u201d The results also stated the doctor\u2019s opinion that he would expect that I am fertile. The two values that fall outside of the normal range (according to WHO criteria) were \u201cOverall Motility\u201d and \u201cRapid Progressive motility.\u201d My Overall Motility is 44%, whereas the WHO fertile range is greater than 50%. Also, my Rapid Progressive motility is at 23%, where normal is greater than 25%.\n\nMy question is: Does somewhat low motility (like I have) increase the risk of miscarriage or have any bearing on miscarriage whatsoever? We are trying to determine if I have an underlying problem here or if we just had bad luck in miscarrying twice in a row. Note that we already have 2 healthy boys, ages 4 and 2.\n\nIf it helps, here are the full results:\n\n* Volume: 2.7 mL --- WHO criteria: 1-6 mL\n* Sperm concentration: 41.5 million/mL --- WHO criteria: more than 20 Million/mL\n* Overall motility (percent of sperm showing movement) 44% --- WHO criteria: more than 50%\n* Rapid progressive motility: 23% --- WHO criteria: more than 25%\n* Normal morphology (Kruger Method \u201cStrict Morphology\u201d): 17% --WHO criteria: more than 4%\n* pH: 8.0 --- WHO criteria: Between 7.6 and 8.2\n* VAP (Average path velocity): 49.1 \u00b5m/s --- WHO criteria: more than 44.28\n* VSL: (Straight line velocity): 40.3 \u00b5m/s --- WHO criteria: more than 35.19\n* AHL (Amplitude of lateral head placement): 2.9 \u00b5m/s --- WHO criteria: more than 2.5\n* Straightness (VSL/VAP; Deviation from avg path): 81% --- WHO criteria: more than 74%\n* Linearity (VSL/VCL; Deviation from actual path): 58%: --- WHO criteria: more than 49%\n\nAny input anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated!

I admit I'm a bit naive about pregnancy, and I also have a phobia of doctors (though I'm planning on making an appointment soon).

I had one ovarian cyst before, and it ruptured in my early 20s. When they did a pelvic sonogram they found I only had that one cyst, so I don't believe I have PCOS or endometriosis. Sorry if this is TMI, but maybe it's relevant. After my fiance \"finishes\" inside me, I always go to the bathroom afterwards to prevent UTIs, and most of his semen comes out when I go.

Please forgive me if I screw anything up. My history in a nutshell is that we've been trying for 7 years now, 1 IVF retrieval, and 2 FETs, never had a positive test. I had the Receptiva biopsy in Fall 2017 which showed integrins present but BCL 6 of 4. I had a laparoscopy that winter that confirmed early stage endo. (up until that point, 5+ years into trying, we had been unexplained). In Fall 2018 I did 3 months of lupron depot, rolled into a FET, which failed. My dr suggested a repeat Receptiva biopsy this month to see where by BCL 6 is at now, and I just got the call today that the biopsy came back with BCL 6 only down to 3.8. After 3 months of Lupron!!! My last monthly lupron shot was in early October.\n\nMy questions: has anyone done a repeat Receptiva biopsy after lupron depot? Did your BCL 6 go down? Has anyone failed a transfer after Lupron Depot for endo and, if so, what has your doctor suggested as next steps? I am scheduled to meet with my doctor in 2 weeks and he already told me (before my biopsy) that we would be having the gestational carrier talk if my BCL 6 came back high again.

Whole chromosomal abnormalities, or aneuploidy, are key determinants of whether human embryos will arrest or reach the blastocyst stage. Depending on the type of chromosomal abnormality, however, certain embryos still form blastocysts and may be morphologically indistinguishable from chromosomally normal embryos. Despite the implementation of pre-implantation genetic screening and other advanced in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques, the identification of aneuploid embryos remains complicated by high rates of mosaicism, atypical cell division, cellular fragmentation, sub-chromosomal instability, and micro-/multi-nucleation. Moreover, several of these processes occur in vivo following natural human conception, suggesting that they are not simply a consequence of culture conditions. Recent technological achievements in genetic, epigenetic, chromosomal, and non-invasive imaging have provided additional embryo assessment approaches, particularly at the single-cell level, and clinical trials investigating their efficacy are continuing to emerge. In this review, we summarize the potential mechanisms by which aneuploidy may arise, the various detection methods, and the technical advances (such as time-lapse imaging, \u201c-omic\u201d profiling, and next-generation sequencing) that have assisted in obtaining this data. We also discuss the possibility of aneuploidy resolution in embryos via various corrective mechanisms, including multi-polar divisions, fragment resorption, endoreduplication, and blastomere exclusion, and conclude by examining the potential implications of these findings for IVF success and human fecundity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeywords: Aneuploidy, Chromothripsis, Fragmentation, Micronuclei, Pre-implantation embryo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11187, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "For anyone who is interested in reading about how embryos correct themselves during development even after day 5 with IVF and naturally, how aneuploid embryos have high rates of mosaicism, atypical cell division, cellular fragmentation, sub-chromosomal instability and mechanisms for correction.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/airqso/for_anyone_who_is_interested_in_reading_about_how/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "Lmahtr", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "34F-BT-ER4", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_58qxi4s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1548192969, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/airvo8/im_back/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "airvo8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1939cb0e-1524-11e9-a01e-0e1796ff099a", "link_flair_text": "TW: Miscarriage/Loss", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 107, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/airvo8/im_back/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1548192970, "score": 1, "selftext": "Our second scan showed we lost it at 6 weeks, likely due to our translocation.

Quick question for the hive mind. I had a full IVF cycle a few months ago (retrieval in July/FET in Oct) and had assisted hatching done on the embryos. Assisted hatching was quoted to me in my retrieval treatment estimate at $1510 which I paid upon receipt. Tonight I got a notification that I owed $1510 for assisted hatching because apparently they performed assisted hatching during embryo culture in July and again on the day of FET in October. They applied the first $1510 to the one performed during embryo culture and are saying that the this bill is for the assisted hatching performed at transfer. Can you even do assisted hatching twice? Let alone bill twice for it in the same cycle? Assisted hatching was only quoted to me as a part of my retrieval, not my FET cycle, and it seems insane that my doctor's office would bill twice for it.

I've been browsing this thread religiously for the last 2 weeks, and have learned so much! As I learn more I end up with more questions, so I thought I'd introduce myself and get some input. Just some background: Me (34 F) and my partner (36 M) have been TTC for a year and a half (with one MC). After a lot of jumping through hoops with insurance, I finally saw the RE who diagnosed me with DOR. I'm honestly so confused right now, and I am looking for some help. My questions are:\n\n* How did you pick what clinic to work with? I'm in the Bay Area, and most clinics seem to be in San Francisco (an hour drive from me). I have reviewed SART, but I am also worried about committing to a clinic in San Francisco because I have a job that isn't very flexible. How important is it to go to a clinic close to you/ your work?\n* My biggest question... is using IVF with my own eggs really an option? I think my DOR stats are really poor (in November AMH = 0.56, FSH = 14.7 and in December AMH = 0.17, FSH = 17.1). Follicle count of 6 at the US. Basically, I'm wondering what other people have done in similar situations. Is it worth it to pursue IVF with my own eggs, or should we be seriously thinking about donor eggs? \n\nI'm sorry if this is breaking any rules, I'm just feeling so lost. I have an appointment scheduled at a local RE, but it's not for 3 weeks, and I'm driving myself crazy with all the unknowns.

I\u2019ll try to keep it brief...\nWhat is standard treatment for PCOS after being on metformin for 9 months? I\u2019m 31 with a history of chemical pregnancies. I\u2019ve done IVF 2x w/ a different partner and have some great info from that....\n\nBackground...\n4 years ago I did 2 fresh &amp; 1 frozen rounds of IVF because my ex DH had a vasectomy and I PCOS.  Total embryos 23.  4 implanted between the first fresh &amp; frozen.  Both ended in chemical pregnancy with strong numbers in the first week.  The second IVF round we found out EVERY embryo had crazy bad genetics.  The drs basically told me and ex DH to not even try for a biokid because of how bad the genetics were.  The drs couldn\u2019t explain it and were genuinely shocked at how bad the results were- I was 27, DH 38.   My egg quality was good, but when the embryo formed, the genes were bad.  Fast forward to now...\n\nI\u2019m remarried with a partner who has never had kids and has never had any fertility testing done.     I\u2019ve been on metformin for 9 months at 1500mg  and my periods are still not regular. I\u2019ve been off birth control since 7/2018.  We\u2019ve been trying since 10/2018.  Nothing.  Just irregular periods.  I\u2019m 31, he\u2019s 30.  \n\nMy goal is to be aggressive because I do not trust my fertility to chance one bit. If I\u2019m\nGoing to do IUI, i want injectables and progesterone shots.  My husband is very apprehensive about anything that\u2019s not natural.  He\u2019s agreed to IUI, but doesn\u2019t like the idea of IVF.   I\u2019m on the fence, knowing how much $$$ it is and how emotional it can be.  We both are comfortable with adoption and are thinking well probably do that.   \n\nWe have our first fertility appointment tomorrow with a new specialist.   Our old specialist deemed me fertile and sjectablesaid to just have sex every day.  Yeah right. My husband\u2019s job is physical and having sex just twice a week is challenging. He\u2019s also finishing up grad school.\n\nIf you had my history, what would you do? Would you go for IVF? Or would you try for the IUIs a couple rounds?  For those who don\u2019t know, adoption can cost anywhere between $500-$20k.   Do you think it would be worth trying IVF if it comes to that or just going straight to adoption? I don\u2019t want to waste money because we don\u2019t have a lot to blow on this. Any thoughts and wisdom appreciated.  \n\nPs:\nWhat is IUI like with and without Injectables???\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11206, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "PCOS w/ long Infertility History", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ajau2m/pcos_w_long_infertility_history/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1548324454, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ajb05k/thursday_am_chat_thread/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ajb05k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 69, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ajb05k/thursday_am_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1548324455, "score": 1, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

Eligible women were undergoing IVF (fresh-embryo or frozen-embryo transfer), with no recent exposure to disruptive intrauterine instrumentation (e.g., hysteroscopy). Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endometrial scratching (by pipelle biopsy between day 3 of the cycle preceding the embryo-transfer cycle and day 3 of the embryo-transfer cycle) or no intervention. The primary outcome was live birth.\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 1364 women underwent randomization. The frequency of live birth was 180 of 690 women (26.1%) in the endometrial-scratch group and 176 of 674 women (26.1%) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.27). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage. The median score for pain from endometrial scratching (on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse pain) was 3.5 (interquartile range, 1.9 to 6.0).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEndometrial scratching did not result in a higher rate of live birth than no intervention among women undergoing IVF. (Funded by the University of Auckland and others; PIP Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12614000626662.)\n\nThe success rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) remains modest; the probability of live birth is approximately 25 to 30% per initiated cycle.1-3 Endometrial scratching, which involves the obtaining of an endometrial-biopsy sample with a sampler such as the pipelle, has been proposed to increase the success rate of IVF. It has been postulated that the endometrial injury, or \u201cscratch,\u201d that results from the biopsy may facilitate embryo implantation by inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms.4-7\n\nPooled results from randomized trials have suggested benefit from this procedure, especially in women in whom implantation had failed previously.8 However, many trials have had methodologic limitations, including small size, and unclear methods of randomization and concealment of trial-group assignments; some have been published only as conference abstracts.9-12 One of the larger trials with a robust design showed a lack of benefit from endometrial scratching; a subgroup analysis suggested lower rates of pregnancy with this intervention than with no intervention among women in whom implantation had failed repeatedly.10,13 Despite conflicting evidence, a recent survey showed that 83% of fertility clinicians in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand offer or recommend endometrial scratching, which can cost patients as much as \u00a3400 (approximately $500 U.S.).14\n\nWe conducted the Pipelle for Pregnancy (PIP) trial to investigate whether endometrial scratching, delivered by an endometrial pipelle biopsy, increases the probability of live birth in women undergoing IVF.\n\nMethods\nTRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT\nThe trial protocol was published previously15 and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Women were eligible if they were planning IVF with their own oocytes (stimulated IVF cycle with planned fresh-embryo transfer, or frozen-embryo transfer with the use of stored embryos); the choice of stimulation protocol and luteal-phase protocol was according to the standard practice at each clinic. Women were excluded if they were not planning an embryo transfer (e.g., fertility preservation or plan to freeze all embryos for storage [freeze-all cycle]), had any contraindication to pipelle biopsy (e.g., vaginismus), or had undergone any disruptive intrauterine procedures within 3 months before the start of IVF (specifically, hysteroscopy, sonohysterography, hysterosalpingography, laparoscopy, surgically managed miscarriage, or endometrial biopsy). Less disruptive procedures, such as embryo transfer and intrauterine insemination, were permitted. All women provided written informed consent.\n\nThe trial was approved by Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health, New Zealand, and subsequently by the relevant ethics committees at all sites internationally. The first two authors, the fourth author, and the fifth author vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\nRANDOMIZATION\nAn online, third-party data-collection and randomization system was used to confirm participant eligibility and ensure concealment of trial-group assignments before randomization. Randomization was performed in a 1:1 ratio with the use of block randomization of two different sizes between 6 and 16 repeating in random order, with stratification according to recruiting site and according to whether a fresh-embryo transfer or frozen-embryo transfer was planned. Women underwent randomization on or after day 1 of the cycle that preceded the IVF cycle. After randomization, trial personnel and participants were aware of the trial-group assignments (i.e., no blinding).\n\nINTERVENTION\nWomen who were assigned to endometrial scratching were scheduled for an endometrial scratch between day 3 of the cycle preceding the IVF cycle and day 3 of the IVF cycle. Day 1 of the IVF cycle was defined as the first day of the menstrual period or withdrawal bleeding, or the day before the first day of stimulation in the case of no bleeding. This time interval was based on previous studies showing benefit from this intervention.16,17\n\nA clinician performed the endometrial-scratch procedures using a pipelle, a plastic biopsy catheter approximately 3 mm in diameter (e.g., Pipelle de Cornier, Laboratoire CCD, France). Participants were advised to attend with a full bladder and to take pain medication before the procedure, according to clinic protocols. The procedure was carried out as described previously.15 If it was not possible to insert the pipelle into the uterus, a tenaculum, local anesthetic, and cervical dilatation were permitted, or a second attempt was scheduled for another day or with a different clinician (or both). The procedure was discontinued at the participant\u2019s request (e.g., because of pain or discomfort) or if the clinician was unable to pass the pipelle. Immediately after the procedure, participants were asked to record the pain experienced during the procedure on a visual analogue scale (scores ranged from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse pain). Participants were contacted within 1 week and asked whether they had any vaginal bleeding the day after the procedure. Participants who were assigned to the control group received standard care.\n\nOUTCOMES\nThe primary outcome was live birth per randomly assigned woman; we included all participants in their randomly assigned groups and adjusted for stratification variables.18 Secondary outcomes were ongoing pregnancy (viable pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation), clinical pregnancy (one or more gestational sacs at approximately 6 weeks of gestation), multiple pregnancy (two or more gestational sacs or heartbeats at the stage of clinical pregnancy), ectopic pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy (defined as a serum level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin of &gt;25 mIU per milliliter or a positive home urinary pregnancy test), miscarriage, stillbirth, pregnancy termination, pain during the procedure, bleeding the day after the procedure, and maternal and neonatal outcomes.\n\nData were also collected on pregnancy outcomes of delayed cycles and (unplanned) freeze-all cycles followed by frozen-embryo transfer if the embryo transfer occurred within 3 calendar months from the expected day 1 of the IVF cycle. Only the result of the first embryo transfer was captured. In addition, any spontaneous pregnancy that occurred before an embryo transfer and within the 3-month window was recorded.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nOriginally, the sample size was calculated on the basis of the anticipated effect size of a 16-percentage-point difference between the two groups for the outcome of live birth, as reported in a Cochrane review.19 At 90% power and a two-sided significance level of 5% and with an adjustment (doubling of the sample) to permit detection of subgroup effects, a sample of 840 women was required.15\n\nAfter the publication of an updated Cochrane review that suggested that the anticipated effect of the intervention might differ between women in whom implantation had failed repeatedly and women in whom it had not, the sample-size calculation was updated on the basis of anticipated effects of the intervention in these two subgroups.8 For the outcome of live birth and at 80% power and a two-sided significance level of 5%, 280 participants with at least two previous unsuccessful transfers were required to detect a between-group difference in live-birth rates of 15 percentage points (31% vs. 16%), and 1002 women with no more than one previous transfer were required to detect a difference of 8 percentage points (33% vs. 25%). Therefore, the trial aimed to recruit a minimum of 1300 women in total (650 per group, at a 1:1 ratio). The primary analyses were planned for the total trial population; post hoc, this would mean that the trial had 80% power to detect a between-group difference in live-birth rates of 7 percentage points. The sample-size amendment was implemented without knowledge of any interim results in the ongoing trial.\n\nOdds ratios were calculated both with and without covariate adjustment for the stratification variables (site and fresh-embryo or frozen-embryo transfer), with 95% confidence intervals and P values. The adjusted analysis was the primary analysis. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted according to fresh-embryo or frozen-embryo transfer, implantation failure (\u22652 or \u22641 previous unsuccessful transfers), recruiting center, cause of subfertility, duration of subfertility, exposure to nondisruptive instrumentation (yes or no), and use of contraceptive pills for IVF scheduling (yes or no). We performed these analyses by including an interaction term between trial-group assignment and each covariate in a multivariable logistic regression. Logistic regression was used to investigate prespecified predictors of live birth in the endometrial-scratch group: timing of scratch in relation to embryo transfer and pain during the procedure. Linear regression was used to investigate prespecified predictors of pain in the endometrial-scratch group: previous cervical surgery, use of contraceptive pills for IVF scheduling, and use of a tenaculum. Confidence intervals for secondary outcomes and subgroups were not adjusted for multiple testing, and inferences that are drawn from the intervals may not be reproducible.\n\nThe primary analyses were performed with the use of R software20 and conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, including all women in their randomly assigned groups. Missing data were not imputed for any variables; however, the four women who withdrew and the one woman lost to follow-up were assumed not to have conceived.\n\nTwo post hoc per-protocol (treatment-received) analyses were performed, which attempted to estimate the effect of receiving endometrial scratching, with the use of randomization as an instrumental variable. These analyses were conducted in reaction to nonadherence observed in the trial, including differences in the proportions of women undergoing embryo transfer between the trial groups. In these analyses, the effect of receiving the scratch was estimated in the whole group and in the subgroup of women who underwent embryo transfer. Both analyses were performed by fitting bivariate probit models with robust standard errors in Stata software.21\n\nResults\nPARTICIPANTS\nFigure 1.\n\nAssessment, Randomization, and Analysis.\nTable 1.\n\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Participants.\nParticipants were recruited during a 3-year period from June 2014 through June 2017 at 13 sites in five countries (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). In total, 3627 women were assessed for eligibility, and 1364 underwent randomization, 690 to the endometrial-scratch group and 674 to the control group (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Approximately 25% of the participants had undergone two or more previous unsuccessful embryo transfers.\n\nTable 2.\n\nCharacteristics of Fresh IVF Cycle.\nTable 3.\n\nCharacteristics of Frozen Embryo Transfer Cycle.\nCycle characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 2 and Table 3). In total, 1118 participants (82.0%) underwent embryo transfer, 586 (84.9%) in the endometrial-scratch group and 532 (78.9%) in the control group. Of 133 women undergoing an unplanned freeze-all cycle, 67 underwent a frozen-embryo transfer within the 3-month window permitted by the trial protocol (Figure 1). In addition, there were 2 women in the endometrial-scratch group whose frozen embryo did not survive thawing and who initiated a new IVF cycle with fresh-embryo transfer within the 3-month window. In total, 20 women became pregnant during the trial without IVF (17 women before starting their IVF cycle, 2 women who were discovered to be pregnant after starting their IVF medication but before oocyte retrieval, and 1 woman during a freeze-all cycle) (Figure 1).\n\nENDOMETRIAL SCRATCH\nOf the 690 women assigned to endometrial scratching, the procedure was performed in 641 (92.9%), either on the first or second attempt (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The procedure was not attempted in 28 women assigned to this intervention, and it was discontinued in 19 cases owing to difficulty navigating the cervical canal and in 1 case owing to participant request. (Information regarding completion of the procedure was missing for 1 participant.) The median time between endometrial scratch and embryo transfer was 35 days (interquartile range, 22 to 39).\n\nWomen who underwent the procedure had a median pain score of 3.5 on a 10-point scale (interquartile range, 1.9 to 6.0); 37 women had a score of 0, and 6 women had a score of 10. There were 14 adverse reactions: 5 women were recorded as having experienced excessive pain, including 1 woman who presented to the emergency department owing to intense pain after the endometrial scratch, which had been conducted concurrently with a sonohysterogram procedure; 7 women fainted or felt very dizzy or nauseous after the procedure; and 2 women had excessive bleeding. These outcomes were subjectively assessed by the clinician performing the procedure. There were no reported cases of infection or other adverse events after the procedure. The procedural information was not captured for 8 participants in the control group who underwent endometrial scratching despite their trial-group assignment.\n\nPROTOCOL VIOLATIONS\nIn addition to the 36 participants whose treatment was inconsistent with their assignment, 5 women underwent a disruptive instrumentation procedure within 3 months before initiating the IVF cycle (four sonohysterogram procedures and one hysterosalpingogram procedure), including 4 in the endometrial-scratch group and 1 in the control group. A total of 4 women withdrew from the trial, all for personal reasons (Figure 1). Demographic data were recorded for these women, but no further information was collected.\n\nOUTCOMES\nTable 4.\n\nTrial Outcomes (Intention-to-Treat Analysis).\nThe live-birth rate was 180 of 690 (26.1%) in the endometrial-scratch group and 176 of 674 (26.1%) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.27; P=0.97; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.27; P=0.99) (Table 4). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage (Table 4). The results of the per-protocol analyses were similar to those of the primary analysis (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\nThere was no evidence of any benefit from endometrial scratching among women in whom implantation had failed at least twice or among women in whom it had failed no more than once (estimated interaction odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.15; P=0.14) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). In addition, there were no significant interactions for any other subgroups for the outcome of live birth (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Neither the days between endometrial scratch and embryo transfer nor pain during the procedure was a predictor of live birth in the endometrial-scratch group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). In women undergoing endometrial scratching, pain was unrelated to previous cervical surgery or use of contraceptive pills for IVF scheduling but appeared to be slightly greater with the use of a tenaculum (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\nDiscussion\nThe PIP trial was a large, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized trial of endometrial scratching as compared with no procedure before an IVF cycle. Endometrial scratching did not result in higher rates of the primary outcome of live birth than no procedure in intention-to-treat or in post hoc per-protocol analyses.\n\nSubgroup analyses did not identify any populations of women who might benefit. There was no benefit observed in the subgroup of women in whom implantation had failed at least twice; the point estimate in an interaction analysis was in the direction of lower effectiveness of endometrial scratching in these women than in women in whom implantation had failed no more than once, as was reported in another large trial,13 and the confidence interval suggests that a benefit is unlikely.\n\nThe median pain score during the procedure was 3.5 of 10, and there were 14 adverse reactions. Additional potential harms of endometrial scratching include cost and inconvenience; most procedures were scheduled as an extra clinic appointment, and in practice an endometrial scratch costs patients up to \u00a3400 when offered in a private fertility setting.14\n\nThe results from multiple previous trials have been inconsistent but have generally favored endometrial scratching in women undergoing IVF.8,22-26 Many of these studies were small and underpowered or suffered from a high risk of bias, such as lack of concealment of trial-group assignments (which is known to be associated with exaggeration of treatment effect)27,28 and other biases (e.g., stopping early for a positive effect).8 The current trial had a large sample size, concealed trial-group assignments to limit the potential for selection bias, and had minimal attrition; four women withdrew from the trial, and the pregnancy outcome of only one other participant is unknown. The rate of single-embryo transfer was similarly high in both groups in this trial, which reflects current recommended practice and limits the potential for performance bias. Furthermore, the pragmatic trial design and the recruitment in 13 fertility clinics across five countries improves the generalizability of the results. Despite availability of the procedure privately in many fertility centers,14 only eight participants in the control group are known to have had the endometrial scratch during the trial and 92.9% of the women in the endometrial-scratch group completed the procedure.\n\nAn important limitation of our trial is the lack of blinding. It is possible that knowledge of trial-group assignments may have contributed to the higher proportion of participants in the control group than in the endometrial-scratch group who did not undergo embryo transfer. There were imbalances favoring the endometrial-scratch group both in the proportion of women starting an IVF cycle and in the number of women with embryos available for transfer after oocyte retrieval (Figure 1). Women in the endometrial-scratch group may have been more likely to start their cycle in order to capitalize on their exposure to the endometrial scratch. However, results were materially unchanged in a per-protocol analysis. Another potential limitation is that the definition of recurrent implantation failure in this trial was two or more previous unsuccessful transfers and did not involve consideration of the stage or quality of the transferred embryos.29 Last, because the outcomes of pain and bleeding were captured only in the endometrial-scratch group, it is not possible to compare the frequency of these adverse events between trial groups.\n\nIn conclusion, in this large, multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial of endometrial scratching before IVF, endometrial scratching did not result in a higher live-birth rate than no endometrial scratching. The procedure was associated with a mild amount of pain and a small number of adverse events.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11205, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New study on Endometrial Scratch!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ajc71s/new_study_on_endometrial_scratch/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "jwp0726", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15d7bi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1548345330, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ajdrsh/trouble_conceiving_male_infertility/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ajdrsh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ajdrsh/trouble_conceiving_male_infertility/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1548345331, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone. Hope I've come to the right place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife and i have been trying to conceive for the last 14+ months with no success. We've started the process of working with an infertility doc + urologist to see what's going on. Here are our steps so far: \n\n* July 2018: Wife was advised by OB/GYN that all seemed normal, and to follow up with infertility if 6 more months passed.\n* November 2018: I started down the path of getting tested via my PCP so that i would ideally have something to take with us to the infertility doctor. He referred my to a urologist that was able to order a semen analysis.\n* (Later in) November 2018: Had semen analysis. Clear issues from my side (see other section below)\n* December 2018: Initial Fertility Doc visit where we shared the knowledge of my issues. He ordered blood testing for both, genetic testing for me, a follow up for me with a more infertility specializing urologist and a HSG for my wife.\n* January 2019: Blood + Genetic testing done (not sure of results). Follow up with urologist yielded more bad news (below). Still outstanding are the HSG for my wife (tomorrow) and our follow up with the fertility doc (Monday).\n\nTo date, we're not aware of any issues my wife is having but that should be better confirmed on Monday. Here is what is going on with me: \n\n1. The semen analysis revealed issues with concentration/motility impacting my overall sperm count. They had to extract a 10ul drop for further examination (I think he said in a centrifuge) and saw that there were \"rare motile and many non-motile sperm\". I guess my count isn't necessarily 0, but it's also not very much. \n2. At urology follow up today the doctor did a physical examination and feels that based testicle size my issue is related to sperm production as opposed to a blockage of some sort.\n\nI have two recommended paths forwarded, both as input to likely IVF:\n\n1. Testicular Biopsy for extraction\n2. Clomid + L - Carnitine + Folic Acid for 3 months and a follow up semen analysis. Also suggested the standard no drinking/no smoking/healthy eating and regular exercise. He didn't sound optimistic about this approach but I want to try it all the same. We're still relatively young, need to save IVF money anyhow, and #1 sounds like absolute hell. \n\nIf you're still reading this novel, I guess I'd really just know:\n\n1. If anyone has had any success whatsoever in actually conceiving with these specific/similar challenges?\n2. Is a Testicular Biopsy as painful as he described it?\n3.

My AMH and FSH were good and so we were hopeful. Well, today we went for the eco and apparently I'm not responding v well to the stims... I only have 3 follicles that are ready for retrieval... one super dominant. They upped my meds and we will stim for 3 more days, then go back on Monday for another eco. If it doesn't look like we have at least 5-7 follicles ready for retrieval, they advised to skip extraction this cycle and start a new stim cycle next month and hope that I respond better (the thinking is that doing a retrieval and getting only 3 eggs is just not worth the stress of the surgery). We need about 30 eggs retrieved so that we can hope for about 20 fertilized and then have at least 6 get to day 5 so we can send them for testing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeeling frustrated right now because I guess I was overly optimistic because we weren't doing IVF for fertility reasons so I  thought it would be relatively \"easy\" for us, but I guess that was naive and that's not the case.
