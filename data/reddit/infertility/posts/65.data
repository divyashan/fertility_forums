We started IVF originally for PGD testing. Along the way, we have been given diagnoses that suggest implantation will be difficult. We've only had one FET so far (it was unsuccessful). We spent the last three egg retrievals embryo banking, because I'm not getting any younger and my insurance was good. Because we had to do PGD testing, our RE didn't give us Day 3 or Day 5 updates really. She only told us which were eligible for biopsy (i.e. which ones were hatching blastocysts that looked good enough to biopsy). She told us that this criteria is stricter than simply freezing embryos that make it to day 5.\u00a0\n\n  \n[Here](http://theinfertilityhandbook.com/2018/07/28/all-of-my-ivf-cycles-by-the-numbers/)\u00a0is a spreadsheet with our IVF cycles by the numbers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are a few things I noticed:\n\n* After IVF #1, my doctor was dumb-founded. She couldn't explain why our cycle had gone poorly. I imagine that if I were older or had some other issue, she would have blamed that. She said for someone my age, she expected at least 4 day 5 embryos.\u00a0\n* My estradiol was regularly above 2,000 at trigger. Apparently this isn't normal, as my doctor and the nurses commented on this often when they looked at my charts. I didn't experience any OSHH, just weeklong constipation.\n* My lead follicle was only 17.5 mm for my best cycle (IVF #2). I was terrified when they told me to trigger because everywhere online, it said a minimum of 18 or 22 was recommended.\n* The lupron microdose protcol worked way better for me. I think this is a testament to trying different protocols.\u00a0\n* Even though we found a protocol that worked great for us, whether it was because of the small change in dosage or what, we didn't hit embryo-gold twice (IVF #2 vs IVF #3). It really does vary from cycle to cycle.\n* You can fall on any side of the statistics. As I've mentioned before, statistically, only 25% of our embryos should have the disease my husband and I are carriers for. However, in practice, 58% of them have the disease.\u00a0\n\nSometimes I read posts by women wondering if they should do another cycle. And I kind of wonder to myself, what if my cycles had been in a different order? What if IVF #1 happened, then IVF #3? I'd be terrified and deeply concerned. I definitely recommend at least 3 egg retrievals, if you can afford it.\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 9671, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some observations of mine after doing three egg retrievals (particularly, as a young person with PGD)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9gbu7e/some_observations_of_mine_after_doing_three_egg/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "GooberBuber", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12qs8f", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537116259, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9gc0dt/using_a_donor_egg_and_sperm/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9gc0dt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/9gc0dt/using_a_donor_egg_and_sperm/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1537116260, "score": 5, "selftext": "Hello,\n\nGetting a micro tese on Tuesday but preparing for the worst.

My RE would have preferred depot lupron for 3 months to not risk any damage to my ovary but after researching it I felt that I was more comfortable with the surgery. Stage 3/4 endo was removed (no endometriomas). I went for an AFC three weeks post op and was relieved when they counted 5 on the R, 0 on the L (my left is always stingy but usually musters up a follicle or two when stims start) since more endo was removed on my right side.

I almost missed it honestly because I didn't have much EWCM. I can't even really describe it as EWCM because it was sort of chunky but still stretchy and slippery. \nI tend to get sore nipples literally the day after ovulation, and last cycle I got the tiniest amount of soreness ever. (I'm aware it's something to do with Progesterone, but how come when I'm not taking Clomid my after O nips KILL but on my Clomid cycles they don't??)\nI also didn't get a big temp jump. My temps went up to 97.34. I was honestly convinced I had not ovulated and I spent a week terrified/almost crying thinking Clomid had totally failed me, but 12 days after FF predicted I had ovulated (And all of these symptoms) my period arrived and it was what I would describe as a 'normal' period. Usually, when I haven't ovulated my periods are very light and don't hurt at all - I know the difference between a no o period and an o period, basically.\n\n\nIt's been similar again this cycle. I was so convinced I had not ovulated and wouldn't ovulate. I got the 'kinda' EWCM 3 days ago, I got a 'nearly positive' OPK at the same time. \nYesterday evening my nipples began to hurt slightly, again not majorly, I was actually doubting if they really did hurt or I was imagining it.\n\n\nThis morning I took my temp and it has spiked. Yet again only to 97.34, but it definitely has gone up.\n\n\nHas anyone else noticed this with Clomid? Everyone told me that Clomid would cause 'stronger ovulation' but for me it hasn't at all.

I'm quite anxious by nature, but having been well informed about what to expect (thanks to all of you) has made this process so much easier for me. We went straight to IVF because of my diagnosis and the length of time we have been trying making it unlikely to find success with IUI. I responded well to the drugs, had no side effects except for feeling a bit bloated toward the end, had nicely rising estrogen levels, and a good number of follicles around and above 20 mm. \n\nI just had my first egg retrieval on Friday. Everything went great and I was told that they were able to retrieve 17 eggs. Sadly, the hunger games hit me hard and early. I missed Saturday's call and was informed via voicemail that, while 16 of the 17 eggs were mature, only 2(!) fertilized normally. We are pretty devastated already and doubt there will even be any left to transfer. \n\nThe only upside here is that thanks to my eternal pessimism we signed up for a Shared Risk program. So I know that we can and will try again and it will \"only\" cost us the price of the medications this time. However, I would really like to know what could have caused such a low rate of fertilization (12.5%). I've been googling and searching this sub all weekend but haven't come across a clear answer as to whether this is most likely due to egg quality or sperm issues. My husband's first semen analysis wasn't exactly stellar but not too worrisome either. And his more recent one was better. I have been taking supplements (including CoQ10, Myo-Inositol, Maca, Acai, and resveratrol for improving egg quality) for months before starting IVF. \n\nI'm currently awaiting the phone call with my day 3 update and will ask my RE the same question. But I was just wondering if any of you had any input.

I found it helpful because it was hard to find an example of a day-by-day stimming protocol online. It also help to set expectations.\n\nOne thing to note is that because we had to do PGD testing, our RE didn't give us Day 3 or Day 5 updates. She only told us which ones were eligible for biopsy (i.e. which ones were hatching blastocysts that looked good enough to biopsy). She told us that this criteria is stricter than simply freezing embryos that make it to day 5.\u00a0\n\nSometimes I read posts by women wondering if they should do another cycle. And I kind of wonder to myself, what if my cycles had been in a different order? What if IVF #1 happened, then IVF #3? I'd be terrified and deeply concerned. I definitely recommend at least 3 egg retrievals, if you can afford it.\u00a0That's just my .02. \n\nI also know some women have done the same protocol three times! Without changing things. I hope this also helps to illuminate the difference a change in protocol can make. Or really, just how cycles can vary one from the other. \n\nSome other things I observed:\n\n* My estradiol was regularly above 2,000 at trigger. Apparently this isn't normal, as my doctor and the nurses commented on this often when they looked at my charts. I didn't experience any OSHH, just weeklong constipation.\n* My lead follicle was only 17.5 mm for my best cycle (IVF #2). I was terrified when they told me to trigger because everywhere online, it said a minimum of 18 or 20 was recommended.\n* You can fall on any side of the statistics. As I've mentioned before in this subreddit, statistically, only 25% of our embryos should have the disease my husband and I are carriers for.

The AMH test didn't change with the test that was taken one month later, but the FSH number went down to 13. This is confusing as this second test was done on day 7, so I'm thinking it could actually be lower? Regardless, I've scheduled a couple of initial consultations with RE's in my area. I'm 32 and we have been trying for almost 2 years, with 1 pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. \n\nSo, I have some very difficult decisions to make, that I'm sure will become more clear after speaking with an RE, but I also want to hear from all of you, or anyone who might relate to my story. I'm an artist, who has been working in a customer service position for a couple of years now, and am completely miserable at my job. I am planning on starting an interior design program this fall. It's a 1-2 year program that is somewhat flexible in terms of the schedule. I'm so excited to get started, and believe that I would be a great designer. I've struggled with feelings of self-doubt and a lack of confidence and am finally starting to feel like I can do it, thanks to counseling and a very supportive partner.\n\nNow, the difficult decision. My current employer is based in Massachusetts, so my health insurance covers infertility treatments, including donor egg. Which I know is pretty rare. I live in Oregon, where it is not typically covered. We can not afford fertility treatments without my insurance. Because I want to pursue this new career path, I don't want to keep my job after going through this design program. So the tentative plan is to get the RE's opinion, and if they recommend donor egg, going for it right away. \n\nI keep seeing comments from women who want to exhaust all of the possibility of using their own eggs before pursuing donor eggs, which makes total sense. What if I decide to use donor eggs right away, and then conceive naturally some day? How will that affect our family and the children? I honestly don't see myself being able to handle the ups and downs of multiple IVF attempts, and I don't want to work at my current job for another two years, because it's quite depressing. If I DON'T go the donor egg route, I could never have children. Which, I think that I would be fine with but might regret. Another reason why I am interested in using donor eggs is because there is a pretty strong history of mental illness in my family. I have also struggled with anxiety and depression, and the thought of having a child who will struggle in the same way, really concerns me. \n\nI know that you all can't make this decision for me, but I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Am I giving up on my body or just grieving the loss of a potential biological child? A part of me just wants to forego intervention completely, and just live my life and follow my dreams. Maybe I will be able to afford adoption someday.

Its been a while since I've posted here but something happened yesterday that I just need to vent about, or maybe marvel at. I'm not really angry per se... but amazed/dumbfounded/creeped out? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday we had our IVF consult (YAY) and we went to dinner at my FIL's house. Naturally we were talking about that, everyone knows what we are going through because we are very open about it on facebook and instagram. So we are at dinner and as usual my FIL's fiance facetimes him when she wakes up. She is in the Philippines (citizen there, they met online and have met once for 1 week). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I continue, a little background... We are doing IVF because we need to use my husbands frozen sperm from before cancer treatment. We have six vials. Its NOT six samples, its 1 sample split 6 times... so its not much. Not as much as we want anyways but its what we have. My FIL got snipped after my husband was born. FIL is 52, his fiance is about my age (23)... she wants kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to the story. She finds out we are over and says to FIL \"OH! Now would be a good time to ask them since we are all here!\" and FIL turns to us and says \"Would we be able to use some of your frozen sperm to have a kid?\" ....... I'm sorry... what. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe said no because 1) thats weird 2) don't want my husband to have 2 biological children born near each other and 3) they will not last and 4) THATS REALLY WEIRD... ITS HIS DAD.

The reason why currently reproductive endocrinologists tell people to abstain 3 to 5 days is because The Who guidelines testing was done with that amount of abstinence in mind. Which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u2019s the best thing to do for the healthiest sperm. \n\nI know for some people who have extremely low counts they may want to wait longer to get more of a total count, but that also may mean you get more of worse quality and if you have enough of better sperm for ICSI or IVF from a shorter abstinence period that may be the way to go. It has been known that ICSI doesn\u2019t solve all of our issues since people still have implantation failures and miscarriages but we can increase the potential of better choice of sperm for those procedures.  The longer sperm sits around the more oxidative damage and dna damage it may be sustaining. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that from personal experience we have been pregnant 4 times. The times we had sex every day the week of ovulation the pregnancies went on 12weeks, the days where we had sex every 3 days, our 2 ended by 5 weeks. Our problem is still severe at baseline but this actually made sense to me with what I know about embryo development and sperm damage parameters. \n\nAlso this paper isn\u2019t about ejaculating  \n every day for the heck of it, hoping things would improve - it\u2019s really talking about doing a short ejaculatory phase for the IVF semen collection. It would be unwise to start ejaculating every day because those effects could also be deleterious and affect your hormones etc. that would need constant demand in sperm production. But I am curious about this during ovulation weeks as well as something like this for a one time IVF semen collection so short term short ejaculatory cycle. \n\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-09/asfb-sqs091718.php\n\nOriginal paper\nhttp://www.mcponline.org/content/mcprot/early/2018/08/20/mcp.RA117.000541.full.pdf\n\n\n\u201cReproductive Outcomes in IVF are Significantly Improved When Using Spermatozoa Derived after 1\u20133 Hours of Abstinence\u2014Notably, as shown in Table 2, the implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates were significantly increased by 25.1%, 21.2%, and 36.7% from ejaculates after 1\u20133 hours of abstinence compared with 3\u20137 days of abstinence in frozen\u2013thawed cycles, respectively.

We're in the process of partner IVF and I have a lingering question about CMV status.  My partner and I were tested for CMV along with all the other things.  Apparently a high percentage of adults have been infected (50 - 80%, I think) and people who are infected don't usually know they are because it's ... the common cold or something.  I tested positive, and my partner tested negative. \n\nIn the process of selecting donor sperm, we noticed that the donor profile listed CMV status.  Our preferred donor - along with many/most donors we looked at - was CMV+.  When we asked the RE about this, she said the standard caution was not to put CMV+ sperm into a CMV- body.  She also said the risk was minuscule to nonexistent, and pointed out that I am CMV+ and so partner IVF will always involve a CMV+ person's DNA going into a CMV- person's body.  She said she fertilizes CMV- eggs with CMV+ partner sperm on a regular basis and has never had an issue.\n\nProbably because we're a couple days away from beta testing, this is on my mind again. I'm wondering if it's come up for anyone else.  I asked my friends who did IUI or IVF with male partner's sperm and none of them knew their CMV status or their partner's, nor had they had it come up at all.  This could mean they're both negative, or that it's not routinely raised.  The very, very tiny risk is of contracting CMV while pregnant, the only time it can be dangerous. Of course, a CMV negative person could technically be at risk at any time, not just from IVF, and as I understand it CMV negative women doing IVF aren't warned about this because the risk is so low.\n\nWith that long background, I'm curious if this came up for you in the process - and for any CMV- women with CMV+ partners or donors, did your RE or clinic have an issue?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 9716, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "CMV status - has it been an issue for IUI/IVF?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9h6880/cmv_status_has_it_been_an_issue_for_iuiivf/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "WriterLife2009", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16o2wi", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537372707, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9h6e4u/having_a_hard_time/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9h6e4u", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/9h6e4u/having_a_hard_time/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1537372708, "score": 4, "selftext": "This is my third post in as many days, and today is the worst i've felt in the now 15 cycles of trying.\n\nSuspected endo, confirmed polyps, surgery to be scheduled.

Sorry it\u2019s kind of long but I\u2019m floundering and really need some perspective and advice. \n\nWe\u2019ve now had two failed transfers (one CP, one total negative.) For the first time my RE seems to be starting to wonder if there\u2019s something else we are missing, or if this is just bad luck. It\u2019s pretty much a tossup between the two. We have 5 frozen untested embryos left of varying quality from great (2) to good/fair (3), and have to use at least 3 before we can be approved by insurance for another transfer. Testing the embryos right now is not an option although if we need another retrieval in the future we will definitely do PGS testing. \n\nWe have two choices:\n\n1) try one more transfer in November (have to wait a cycle in between due to insurance authorization) with no changes other than vaginal estrogen rather than oral to try to plump up a lining that was mostly fine if a little on the thinner side (8mm). If this transfer failed we would start a mock cycle right away in December/January and go from there. \n\n2) start a mock cycle with my forthcoming period next week, and do two biopsies on \u201ctransfer\u201d day: one to test for endometritis and other infections and an ERA. It would likely be done in conjunction with a hysteroscopy. The ERA is experimental and not covered but the rest of the cycle (monitoring, meds, biopsy procedure) would be covered by insurance because of the other biopsy. We would just pay OOP for the ERA fee, I think its $650. If we do this we won\u2019t get results back soon enough to transfer in November, so we\u2019d be looking at a December/January transfer. \n\nI really thought I\u2019d be leaning more toward the testing than I am. I\u2019m incredibly torn. Statistics say it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019d have an infection or a displaced transfer window, but they also say I\u2019d be pregnant by now. The thought of waiting that long until next transfer makes me feel sick. But so does the thought that we could just be throwing embryos in and wasting them on a busted uterus. Two failed transfers doesn\u2019t quite feel like the danger zone yet but I\u2019m terrified of how I\u2019ll feel with a few more fails under my belt too. Plus I\u2019m scared about having to do 3 more transfers if both tests come back without any issues. What the heck will we change then? \n\nThis is compounded by the fact that if another retrieval is necessary I\u2019d really like to get that done next plan year.

I am getting ready for my first round of IVF. As part of that process, I went in today for a saline ultrasound. Emotional Me hoped it would be a pretty quick and easy thing that would result in good prognosis, but Rational Me knew that wasn't going to happen, because no other step in this infertility journey has gone smoothly, so why should this routine procedure be any different?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRational Me was correct: they found a uterine polyp. Now, to be clear: I know this is far from the end of the world. I'm confident it can and will be successfully removed. What is making me (perhaps irrationally) angry is that I am just now finding out about it. I have been going to this clinic for almost a year now (happy anniversary to me), and in fact because of that I had to do a full physical today before we even got to the SIS, which ended up contributing significantly to my current state of mind. (You know what isn't going to make that blood pressure reading go down, nurse? You saying Are you nervous and barking RELAX in my face over and over again - especially when it turns out the problem is with your fucking malfunctioning blood pressure reader, not with my actual blood pressure.) In the course of this year of treatment, I had to have a laparotomy to have ten fibroids removed, and as a result of that procedure I have undergone two HSGs and now two SIS procedures (not to mention approx a billion vaginal ultrasounds) -- and you're just NOW telling me about this fucking polyp?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be fair - I don't really know anything about polyps, what causes them, how long it takes them to pop up, etc. But I do know that I have spent the last seven months undergoing IUI after IUI, and it's possible that none of them ever really had any real chance of success because of this fucking thing in my uterus, which no one thought to look for. Also, the process of even finding it today was fairly hellacious -- my cervix tends not to cooperate (sits at a weird tilt, plus today it was apparently too stiff for them to penetrate it on the first try, WTF), so they spent a full half hour digging around in there with the speculum before they could even inject the saline to do the ultrasound. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and even so it really fucking hurt. Also, NP asking \"Do you have any questions for me?\" at the end of it -- that is a really fucking good question, because it turns out I do have one, namely, \"Uh.... yeah, did you see anything bad?\" She wasn't even going to tell me about the damn polyp unless I explicitly asked about the results!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, on a rational level I know this is really not a big deal and that other people get MUCH worse news every single day. I'm just pissed at the way it was handled. And I'm just so very, very worn down, as all of us in this sub are, with the cumulative frustration of this infertility journey. And to add one final note of insult to injury, I don't even have a clear idea of where things stand, because the NP said a doctor needs to take a look at the results and weigh in before we can move forward with scheduling a hysteroscopy or whatever ends up being done, and the physician on call is in a different office today and won't be able to get back to me until tomorrow. Never mind that the RE that I am assigned to and have been working with this whole time is physically present, sitting in his office right at that very moment -- why can't he do it and spare me waiting for a phone call???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&lt;deep breath&gt; TL;DR really frustrated at poor communication and potential sloppiness from my RE's office.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 9718, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Prepping for IVF - Rant (uterine polyp)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9h8aw1/prepping_for_ivf_rant_uterine_polyp/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "catsrfunny", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hpcq3", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537393564, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9h9ejb/not_sure_whats_next/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9h9ejb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/9h9ejb/not_sure_whats_next/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1537393565, "score": 2, "selftext": "Posting here per suggestion from TTAB...\n\nMy wife (late 30's) and I (early 40's) in california, and have been ttc for about a year now. 3 months ago, we decided to see an IVF specialist given our age and \"lack of progress\". On initial visit, we did ultrasound and found my wife has 9 (total) antral follicles, and gave us a probability of full term pregnancy at 24% on first IVF try, up to 50% on 3rd try. The odds seem low, but we decided to take the next step with ORA test. We just received the 3rd ORA result (FSH:11.2 &amp; estradiol: 45), and the doctor decreased the probability  to 10-11% with 2 embryos transferred. Needless to say, we are both sadden by this news. The doctor said we can go for a 3rd ORA test if we want (wife reasons if first three tests yield similar results - why would a 4th test change). The doctor also said if we want to start the next steps (wife going on birth control), we can do that also. Again, we're both not sure why if the results have been less than ideal. \n\nAnyways, we want to have a meeting with the doctor - he'll only take questions over the phone and needs us to send questions in advanced. So, we're trying to see what questions to ask... besides why a 4th test and why start birth control if probability is low (perhaps the doctor offers this in case couples want to move ahead even with low probability?)... sorry, we're feeling a bit lost in this topic.

Hopefully this will help at least someone! Forewarning, I\u2019m not medically trained person. I\u2019m just a farm girl and horse owner that\u2019s been doing IM and IV shots for them for 10 years and now doing all my own shots (up to #146 this morning) through all my treatments. If the medical people of this board would like to add on or correct me, please do!\n\nLet's get important stuff out of the way:   \n**ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE MESSING WITH YOUR MEDICATIONS AND USE A CLEAN SURFACE. STERILITY IS IMPORTANT! IF YOU DROP A NEEDLE, IMMEDIATELY DISPOSE OF IT!**\n\nFirst, the basics where we\u2019ll start with the explanation of needle sizing. The higher the gauge number, the smaller the needle! When you get your blood draws, that is typically a 21 gauge needle to give you reference. The little pen needles that come with your Gonal F/Follistim pens? 29 gauge. Insulin needles are generally 28 gauge. So when you look at all the different needles they give you, the higher gauge ones are generally the ones you\u2019re going to inject with and the higher the gauge, the less you\u2019ll feel the poke. I\u2019ll get into specific needles for specific medications a bit later. \n\nNow, let\u2019s go into needle sizes and their purposes. Most of the time you\u2019ll have \u00bd\u201d needles, sometimes some 1\u201d needles, and 1 \u00bd\u201d needles. The \u00bd\u201d needles are meant for subcutaneous (subq) injections, those are the ones you generally do in your belly where you just want to pierce the skin and inject the medication into the tissue layer between skin and muscle. The 1\u201d and 1 \u00bd\u201d needles can be for drawing medication or an intramuscular (IM) injection. For an IM, you want to inject the medication into the muscle and not just into the skin or fat, that is why you generally do it on the outer butt/hip or the thighs. (See this link for a diagram for gluteal IM shots, notice it\u2019s at the TOP of the quadrant, above the butt crack: [http://d1yboe6750e2cu.cloudfront.net/i/5460901863d5cdf2bbea4888201fddcb4914a53c](http://d1yboe6750e2cu.cloudfront.net/i/5460901863d5cdf2bbea4888201fddcb4914a53c) )\n\nDraw needles are important even though they can seem like a hassle. A draw needle is the needle you use to draw the medication from the vial and generally is a 22g x 1\u201d or 1 \u00bd\u201d. By using a draw needle, you will keep your injection needle pristinely sharp which will make insertion a whole lot easier! A dull needle is harder to stick in your body and will cause far more pain than a sharp one. It only takes piercing the rubber of a vial ONCE to dull a needle.\n\nDrawing medications from vials is tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s actually pretty easy. Make sure to use the draw needle if there is one supposed to be used, some won\u2019t like lo dose hCG or Lupron where you use insulin syringes with non-removable needles. The draw needle will be the longer and bigger needle (but with the lower gauge number, ie 22g x 1 \u00bd\u201d). Twist it onto the syringe (fun fact: this is called a leur lock style syringe) and draw enough air for the dose you need to withdraw. Insert the draw needle into the vial at a 90\u2019 angle. Inject the air into the vial and then flip the vial upside down, pulling your syringe out to where the tip is just barely in the vial. Pull the plunger out slowly and steadily until it\u2019s filled. You\u2019ll see that there\u2019s usually an air bubble at the top from where there was air space in your needle when you started to draw back. It\u2019s an easy fix to do when you\u2019re still drawing, just inject the liquid back into the vial until the air is gone and the syringe is full of solid liquid, then start drawing the medication back out until you get to your dose. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your dose, withdraw the draw needle from the vial and then pull some air into the syringe (yes I told you to do something different a second ago, but I promise there\u2019s a method to my madness!) so that when you remove the needle, all the medication is in the syringe and none in the needle. When you draw the air in, make sure you get the air bubble properly into the main part of the syringe, it makes getting it out much easier and lets there be only ONE air bubble versus two. Replace the draw needle with your injection needle and then push the plunger slowly to get the air bubble out until there\u2019s a drop of needle at the tip of it. If you\u2019re scared about pushing TOO much out because resistance, don\u2019t push from the bottom of the plunger, but grab the neck only a little bit above the top of the actual syringe and push from there. That way your fingers will meet the syringe before you can go too far. \n\nI can\u2019t stress how important it is to get the air out of the needle. It will make your injection so much easier and less painful when you go to do it. If there\u2019s multiple bubbles of air in there, simply flick the syringe until they become one big air bubble at the top. Sometimes that means you have to draw even more air into the syringe and that\u2019s ok. When you get your one big air bubble at the top, carefully push the plunger until all the air is out before attempting to inject.\n\nAlright, now onto specific needles for specific medications: \n\n* Gonal F/Follistim pens have their own pen needles which just get screwed right on. Don\u2019t throw away the big umbrella cap when you get the needle on as you can put it back on for easy removal of the pen needle! \n* Menopur will come with two vials and two needles, but one syringe. Use the 22g x 1 \u00bd\u201d needle to draw the sterile diluent (sodium chloride) from the vial and then injecting the liquid into the powder. You can use the needle to stir the powder a bit to reconstitute it a bit quicker, DO NOT SHAKE VIAL. Draw the reconstituted medication into the syringe and then replace with the injection needle which is either a 27g x \u00bd\u201d or 5/8\u201d needle. Remember to follow the drawing instructions above to get the air out! \n* Cetrotide will come with a prefilled syringe of sterile water. Use the 20g x 1 \u00bd\u201d needle first to inject the liquid into the powder vial. Use the needle to help stir the powder a bit to reconstitute it a bit quicker, DO NOT SHAKE VIAL. Draw the reconstituted medication into the syringe and then replace with the injection needle which is a 27g x \u00be\u201d needle. Remember to follow the drawing instructions above to get the air out!\n* Ovidrel and Ganirelix are both pre-filled syringes with needles permanently attached. Just make sure to get the air out before injecting! \n* Lupron and lo dose hCG use insulin syringes which are permanently affixed 28g x \u00bd\u201d needles so there is no draw needle. However, these needles are TINY and BEND EASILY! Be careful when you go to draw the medication from the vial to insert exactly at a 90\u2019 angle and withdraw at the same angle. If you bend the needle, inject the medication right back into the vial and try again with a fresh needle. \n* Progesterone in Oil/Ethyl Oleate is probably the most important medication to use a draw needle with. Typically, they send a 20/21/22g needle that\u2019s 1 \u00bd\u201d long. Draw the medication from the vial with it with the instructions given previously. Now, for the injection needle. It seems like a lot of people are sent a 22g x 1 \u00bd\u201d needle to inject with, but I prefer a 25g x 1 \u00bd\u201d. The injection is certainly quicker with a 22g needle because you can force more of the PIO/PEO through it faster as it\u2019s bigger, but a 25g more painless IMO. They will say that you can\u2019t do PIO with a 25g, but that\u2019s a lie as I\u2019ve done a lot of them. When using the 25g you will have to push the plunger harder and keep an eye on it to make sure all the medication is out of it because there is more resistance than the 22g. There is also a happy medium between the two where you can get a 23g needle. For length, 1 \u00bd\u201d is appropriate for most people. HOWEVER, if you are petite or thin with no fat or want to do the thighs (way more painful), you can request a 1\u201d needle as it has to penetrate much less layers to reach muscle. Your nurse will have to specify the 1\u201d needle for your PIO as the pharmacy can\u2019t change that, but you CAN request a different gauge of needle from the pharmacy at fill! \n\nI will not get into actual injecting because I think that the Freedom Pharmacy injection videos are pretty good, but here are some tips:\n\n* Freedom Pharmacy link: [http://www.freedommedteach.com/eng/](http://www.freedommedteach.com/eng/) \n* Bevel point (this is the very tip of the needle) should be angled to enter the skin first for an easier (and less painful) time piercing the skin. For the really small needles, it doesn\u2019t matter too much, but for anything 25g or less it can make a HUGE difference.\n* Pinching the skin to give a firm injection spot can help make injections painless because there will be less resistance. \n* For PIO/PEO, pushing around the injection spot to make it firm can do the same as pinching the skin, but much easier to do. I push with my hand and then do like a Vulcan hand symbol where the injection site is between my spread fingers. Also, relax the leg of the side you\u2019re going to inject. Looser muscle is easier to penetrate than one that\u2019s taunt. It\u2019s important NOT TO FLINCH! \n* After the injection is done and needle removed, immediately apply pressure with a piece of gauze or cotton swab. That will help slow the bleeding much faster. \n\nNow onto syringes! This part should be far shorter at least. There are two styles of syringes you will probably deal with besides insulin syringes, luer lock and luer slip. Luer lock is where the needle twists into the tip of the syringe and luer slip is where the needle just slips on to the tip. If for some reason they ask you which you prefer, always say luer lock because they are far more secure! The insulin syringes are the ones with the tiny needles permanently affixed to where you can\u2019t remove the needle.\n\nWhat makes most of the syringes different in the ones you receive are the units and the volume capacity. There are two units you will deal with in IVF, generally, international units (iu sometimes just referred to as units) and milliliters (mL). They do convert very easily if you get told your dosage in iu instead of mL, but the syringe doesn\u2019t have iu on it. 10 iu/units = 0.1mL. Most of your subq injections will come with either a 50iu/0.5mL syringe OR a 1mL syringe. Your PIO/PEO will probably come with a 3mL syringe. Make sure the syringe you\u2019re using will hold the full dose of what you need to inject and try not to use a bigger syringe than necessary. If they\u2019re packaged separately from your medication, it can be helpful to put them in a Ziploc baggy and label them with the size, needle(s) and medication they\u2019re supposed to be used with. Also put the needles you\u2019re supposed to use with them in the bag. By keeping them separated and labelled, it can make your medication prep so much quicker and easier!\n\nI hope this has helped at least a few people and made some people feel more confident and knowledgeable about which needles to use and how to use them. Good luck to everyone! \n\nP.S. If someone would like for me to make a vial drawing video, I can try to do so.

I am a long time lurker, first time poster. This is my first reddit post so I apologize in advance for any formatting issues. \n\nI (24F) and my (27M) husband have been trying to conceive for 19 cycles. I have mild endometriosis confirmed via laparoscopy in 2015. The laparoscopy found a few spots on my uterus, which ended up being quite surprising because my pain got quite debilitating. The endo was ablated, however I now understand excision via a endo specialist is the recommend route. 6 cycles in my doctor referred my husband for a sperm analysis and myself for an HSG. This was due to the fact that after my surgery my husband and I had did not use any contraception or pull out method for a year, then I subsequently went back on bill control pills to prevent my periods from becoming painful again. His results came back normal, with a slightly low morphology (3%). My HSG while very painful came back clear.\n\nWe tried two cycles of low dose clomid without success. The only blood test that was run was my thyroid which came back normal. We ended up with a cross country move so we did not go further with any testing in home state. In current state we have begun the process of labs for me. My husbands redid his testing and all results came back great. My progesterone came back normal and I have to wait until the next cycle to run day 3 labs. My AMH came back at .39 ng/ml. I am pretty heartbroken as from what I have googled that is extremely low for my age. We were considering IUI, but with endo and my AMH is IVF our only option? I was considering having another laparoscopy due to pain, but I understand that can lead to an even lowered AMH. Previously my husband and I had discussed IVF being at least two years off if it came to that, but do we even have the time now? I suppose I am looking for endo/low AMH experiences or any advice on additional testing or questions I should use to advocate for myself. \n\nThanks in advance for anyone who took the time to read this!\n\n ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 9726, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro Endo/Low AMH advice", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9hgsgd/intro_endolow_amh_advice/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "spermbankssavelives", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "23F, MFI, 0% motility, oncofertility, Sept. consult", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qwq3v9y", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537462844, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9hgyyp/mil_is_not_too_happy_with_our_choice_of_clinic/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9hgyyp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 50, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/9hgyyp/mil_is_not_too_happy_with_our_choice_of_clinic/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1537462845, "score": 5, "selftext": "My MIL works in the medical field as a nurse tech and automatically thinks she knows everything there is to know about it.

We recently had our consult with a fertility clinic, its less well known and a little bit farther of a drive than the major/huge clinic here but its also much cheaper and they have comparable stats on SART. We decided to go with them because of this, I mean why would I pay literally 4 times as much to go to a more \"well known\" clinic with the same stats? Thats like paying for a brand name... She has been sending me email after email from the major clinics website about how to afford treatment or specials they have going on or \"hurry up our last cycle of the year is starting soon\"... its frustrating because we have made our choice AND she's the one that keeps bringing up the fact that we are wasting money by doing something we don't need!

I'm kinda over it at this point, I don't really care what she thinks about me but she would tell everyone else her little sob story and I like them.

She gave me some great advice I thought I'd pass along. For our particular situation I was worried about visiting my husband's family for Thanksgiving. BIL just had a baby (after trying for a month) and I just don't know how I will be able to handle being around it and them, etc without bawling my eyes out the whole time. Last Xmas they told us in person during the family event they were expecting and I seriously still have PTSD from the experience. \n\nFirst thing, she said not stay in their house. (!!!) This had not even occurred to me, we can get a HOTEL. It will give me somewhere to escape to. BRILLIANT. Next is to get an idea of the schedule for the day, and to plan every bit out. Where I will sit, what I will do. I can sit quietly and read a book. This was such a relief to hear, I am \"allowed\" to just be in the presence of everyone but not have to talk to them. I can plan out taking a walk to get a break from everyone as well. Finally, she said to have an agreed upon time that we are leaving as a couple. This will give me an end point to focus on and avoid any fights with husband.\n\nFor Xmas, I don't really feel like seeing my own family (my own brother has a new baby as well) but would rather take a trip.

I know 3 years it's not a long period of time and that people have tried for longer but it was getting too heart breaking me. Every month seeing that all your efforts have gone in to vain. I just couldn't cope with it anymore. I was becoming stressed and depressed. \n\nBorh families are very reserved. So we never had told them as it was happening what we were doing and going through. We kind of discussed the situation at the end when we decided to stop to both our parents and siblings to let them know as we hadn't discussed or mentioned anything to them. It wasn't an in depth discussion as its still a bit of a sore topic and they seemed to be fine with it. \n\nUntil two things happened recently. First - A few weeks ago my husband went to visit his parents on his own and they unleashed on him. Asking how many times we have sex, why we don't have kids etc. My husband try as he may to explain they wouldn't have it. We know that they are quite stressed at the moment due cancer issues with the grandmother so we just chalked it up to them venting their stress on him. I was really pissed off at them as of course they don't have the courage to bring up the matter when I'm there since I'm very vocal about my feelings and thoughts, but my husband is very shy and reserved. He came back home stressed as hell and I wanted to give them an earful for behaving that way.\n\nSecond- Today we found out that his sister is pregnant whilst we were out in a restaurant celebrating his mother's birthday day. I am happy for her but I just wanted to crawl up and cry. With no forewarning or anything she give us the news. I spent the entire meal holding back tears and not interacting much as I was constantly on the verge of starting to sob. Of course from when we left to now as I'm writing this out I haven't stopped tearing. \n\nI thought I had made my peace with it but it's very clear that I haven't. And I'm not sure what to do at this point as I know of course I will keep on having these feelings throughout her pregnancy.

After doing 3 IUIs, they started to think that the issue may be with his sperm so he saw a urologist.  The urologist found that he has a left varicocele and low testosterone.  The urologist is recommending surgery to fix the varicocele and thinks that with surgery we will see a drastic improvement.  I have seen mixed results from the research I have done, especially since the issue is not with overall count, but with motility and morphology.  After talking with this doctor and insurance company, we found out that his insurance will only cover 50% of the doctors fee for the surgery which means that we have to cover the other half out of pocket, plus any hospital and anesthesia fees.  Additionally, the first opening for the surgery is not for 3 months.  This means that we would have to wait at least 6 months to see if the surgery had any positive effect.  \n\nMeanwhile, my RE recommends we move to IVF, but my insurance does not cover anything for IVF so we are hesitant.  Unsure if we should pay for the surgery and hope that in 6+ months we see improvement or if we should go right to IVF.  My husband thinks that doing the surgery and waiting is our best option as it could potentially save us a lot of money if we no longer need IVF.  My fear is that we wait 6 months and nothing changes or things get worse and then we wasted 6 months when we could have been starting IVF.  \n\nAny experience or advice would be appreciated.

I have a 50/50 chance of having Huntington's but I'm choosing to not to test myself for a variety of reasons (no cure, not symptomatic, etc). However, I'm in my late 20's and ready to start a family and don't want my future kids to deal with this disease. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI initially thought I would find out if I had Huntington's Disease before choosing to IVF but at this point I've saved enough money to cover everything. I met with a fertility clinic to discuss my situation and the possibility of doing IVF with PGD without finding out my own diagnosis. The doctor made it seem like taking the medications would suck for a little and the lab takes a while for PGD but this is an otherwise straightforward process and they have a 75% success rate. She said I'd probably only need to go through IVF once and we would just store additional embryos if I want additional kids in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm ready to start the IVF process and thinking it's a good option since I don't want to find out if I have Huntington's and I don't want to pass it on. Am I being naive? Part of me is worried I'm about to spend a shit ton of money on something that will be emotionally draining, possibly unnecessary (meaning if I'm not even positive for the gene), and could result in no baby. But part of me also know I don't want to find out my own diagnosis and would be willing to do whatever it takes to have a healthy kid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 9738, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Am I being na\u00efve?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9hrps8/am_i_being_na\u00efve/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537554959, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9hst1q/friday_afternoon_chat_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9hst1q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 32, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/9hst1q/friday_afternoon_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1537554961, "score": 2, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.
