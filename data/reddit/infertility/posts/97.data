I am a 30 year old and my husband is 32 years old. We have only been trying for 10 months. After about 6-7 months I had a conversation with my OBGYN at my annual appointment about the length of time we had been trying. She agreed to do an initial work up. My work up was fine but my husband had a mildly low sperm count (29 million) but low morphology (3%) on his semen analysis. My OBGYN referred us to RE in April. We met with the RE and we decided to pursue IUI. The first cycle was a bust as I was overstimulated on clomid. The second cycle went beautifully. I was put on letrozole and got 2 follicles and the day of my IUI my husband\u2019s count was 19 million, which wasn\u2019t bad. I felt super optimistic and RE was pretty confident. Unfortunately, it did not work and this past weekend I started day 1 of cycle 11. I had an appointment yesterday with RE for my baseline ultrasound in preparation for IUI#2. At the appointment he mentioned that from his experience, if IUI is going to work, it will happen in the first 2 IUI cycles and if this one does not work, then we should really consider IVF as he feels the low morphology is the main issue and the only way to solve that is through IVF. I really like our RE and trust his experience and advice. I\u2019m just terrified of IVF- emotionally, physically, and financially scared of that route. I really hope this IUI works but I am feeling less optimistic and discouraged.

This is a great opportunity to help welcome and coach the folks that are new to the sub and/or treatment.  Throw someone new the life preserver they need and remind them that we all started out at the beginning once.\n\nPositive HPT or Beta Results should only be posted in the Results thread as per the rules: https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Results%22.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19078, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "new", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Welcome Wednesday Thread (Intros &amp; Newbie Questions)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hrk9xl/welcome_wednesday_thread_intros_newbie_questions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594805570, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hrkjxc/carrier_or_surrogacy_discussion_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hrkjxc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Weekly Theme", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/hrkjxc/carrier_or_surrogacy_discussion_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1594812592, "score": 0, "selftext": "This thread is a dedicated space for those that are pursuing gestational carrier or surrogacy as a solution to infertility.

Hope that's OK!\n\nMy husband and I are doing a timed intercourse cycle. I took my trigger shot yesterday at 5pm and we had sex last night. My doctor's advice was to have sex again tonight.\n\nThe last time I did a trigger shot I am fairly sure I didn't ovulate until three days later, rather than the predicted 36-48 hours. We had sex four days in a row for good measure. I did conceive that time but it was a chemical pregnancy. (I suffer from recurrent loss.)\n\nThis time it won't be possible to just keep having sex until I've confirmed ovulation because my husband is going away for the weekend. \n\nSo our options are:\n\n1. Have sex tonight as per doctor's instructions and leave it at that.\n\n2. Don't have sex tonight but have sex early tomorrow morning (around 36-38 hours after the trigger shot).\n\n3. Have sex tonight and tomorrow morning.\n\nWhich do you think would be best from a timing point of view? I want to try and strike a balance between getting another shot at it before I ovulate and leaving it as late as possible before ovulation in case it takes a few days again like last time. I'm reasonably sure I won't ovulate before 7am tomorrow morning but if I do and we don't have sex tonight, we'll only have had one shot. I had good quality EWCM yesterday so that would probably be OK though. \n\nMy husband's sperm count is normal but not super high (around 33M/ml). If it was super high I'd go for tonight and tomorrow morning but I'm worried there won't be much sperm tomorrow morning if he's only had an 8 hour rest. \n\nThank you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19103, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Timed intercourse - advice please", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hs8sw9/timed_intercourse_advice_please/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "blue_spotted_raccoon", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde631F, 51M\u2022ENDO\u2022MFI\u20222ER\u20223ET\u20221CP ", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2onqmlet", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594908782, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hsacps/faq_tell_me_about_pcos/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hsacps", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 68, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/hsacps/faq_tell_me_about_pcos/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1594908793, "score": 1, "selftext": "This post is for the Wiki, so if you have an answer to contribute for this topic, please do.

I will appreciate your input/advice or if you can share a similar experience. \n\nThis is my 3rd IUI.\n\nMy cycle started 24 days ago. I was on clomid for 10 days total and then gonal-f for 8 days total. \n\nOn wednesday I saw the RE(not my regular one since he is traveling). Follicles were there, and nothing was out of ordinary. She scheduled our insemination for Friday. And instructed to inject the trigger shot that night.\n\nSame day(wednesday) few hours after the visit and BEFORE the teigger shot I started having uterine cramps, ovarian pain and back pain. I did an ovulation test and it was very positive. Later we injected the trigger shot on time. My pain lasted for 7-8 ours until I took a tylonol. \n\nI was worried that my ovulation might have started sooner than planned and thought maybe we need to do the insemination one day early to not miss the window.\n\nI called this morning and we went in for an ultrasound. There were follicles stills(not sure if the same number as before) but also the RE saw a couple of liquid things(?) in my uterus. She hadn't notices such a thing the day before. \n\nShe doesnt know what it is. It can be blood(menstruation starting- but Im not spotting) or embryo sack(if SOMEHOW we got pregnant or something else. \n\nThere is no reliable way to know if Im pregnant because the trigger shot can give us a false positive. The RE wanted to drain the liquid but since there is a possibility of it being an embryo she didnt proceed. They drew blood to test my estrogen and progesteone. \n\nWe are going back in tomorrow.\nI dont know what we should do. Should we forgo the insemination and try naturally instead and possibly lose this cycle? Or should we do the insemination although it will destroy the embryo if there is one?\n\nI dont think the doctor will have a clear diagmosis until tomorrow. \n\nHas anyone else experienced mysterious liquid in their uterus?

I have a very special infertility case and I just wanted to introduce my story and get advice + hope.\n\nI didn\u2019t get my period by the age of 16 and was diagnosed with primary amenorrhea. As a result I was required to get a full fertility work up which included blood tests, genetic tests, a progesterone challenge, an mri, and a bone density scan. After all of my testing the doctor said she couldn\u2019t find anything wrong and that I probably just worked out to much so my official diagnosis was hypothalamic amenorrhea. My bones were underdeveloped, my uterus was small, and I didn\u2019t bleed on progesterone but other than that nothing else was wrong so I was promptly placed on birth control and got my period.\n\nFast forward to when I turned 23 and I revisited the gyno who told me something was wrong because I\u2019ve gained enough weight to have my period, she then referred me to an endocrinologist where I was subjected to another round of testing all to be told again that they couldn\u2019t find anything wrong.\n\nI just continued my birth control. About 2 years ago I started having a constant pain in my left abdomen so I went to the gyno and they performed an ultrasound and found blood on my uterus. Gyno said he normally sees this is menopausal women but I\u2019m not in menopause so as long as I\u2019m not in pain he doesn\u2019t see an issue.\n\nNow I\u2019m ready to have children but I\u2019m very afraid that I just won\u2019t be able to. I\u2019ve reduced that I have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism so I\u2019m afraid of not responding to any medication. I\u2019m also afraid that frequent bv infections and yeast infections due to my fluctuating hormones have scared me and I\u2019m afraid that the blood on my uterus has caused adhesions that will lead to an embryo not being able to implant.\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading my story, I know it\u2019s a very unique case but all advice is greatly appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19126, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Very Special Case of Infertility", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hsrx71/very_special_case_of_infertility/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594978381, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hssqa8/adoption_or_foster_discussion_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hssqa8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Weekly Theme", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/hssqa8/adoption_or_foster_discussion_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1594978391, "score": 1, "selftext": "This thread is a dedicated space for those that are pursuing adoption or foster-to-adopt as a solution to infertility.

I had blood panels done a month before this ectopic and it was all normal, so I have a good reference point. My AMH was 2.6 and FSH was 5. Perfect!\n\nIt took almost four months for my hcg to hit 0 and I decided to stop listening to the shitty advice of my shitty doctor.

Yes you can get this even if you didn't actually give birth. It is causes by a sudden dramatic shift in hormones. You don't have to go through this alone. \n\nI changed doctors and sought out a highly regarded fertility clinic here in California to try to figure out what the hell happened and why. Both my husband and I got tested again and well wouldn't you know! \n\nFirst, my AMH was essentially killed at 0.8 now along with my AFC at a mere 4 total, and FSH at a 9 and the rest of my hormones were complete shit. I'm like a couple of months away from being premenopausal. While mtx is only active in your body for 7 days, it damages the environment for proper egg growth for at least 180 days (Stanford study) and your egg reserve and quality will be shit until after that time is over. So I got a little bit of hope here at least.\n\nSecond, my hsg came back clear. Of course. Some of the studies I waltzed through show that up to 97.5% of women with ectopics actually have clear tubes when tested after the ectopic (note, HSGs can only test for structural issues, not functional ones like issues with ciliae, that you can only assess during a lap surgery. You're not likely to have functional issues unless you also have Endo or PCOS or other medical conditions). So I started to become suspicious of why that happened to me in the first place, since I have no other medical conditions. \nAll the doctors so far I had talked to said that ectopics are either just random or due to blocked tubes but that is actually only the minority of cases! The most likely and highly preventable cause is here: \n\nmy husband got another SA but this time, an \"advanced semen analysis report\" that also looks for DNA fragmentation. This does not get picked up by a regular SA. \nAnd what would you know.... Turns out he has pyospermia (white blood cells in his semen) that are the cause of his high DNA fragmentation (it should be ideally less than 8%, he is at 26%. You're considered infertile at 30%). Dna fragmentation doesn't stop you from conceiving, but it does cause ectopics and miscarriages, especially missed miscarriages. \nEven when doing IVF, because unless you ask for a DNA fragmentation test, they will commonly just do a regular semen analysis where this issue won't show, and you will likely make \"normal\" embryos, because even PGS testing doesn't pick up dna fragmentation, and you will keep getting ectopics and miscarriages, wondering what the f*.\nOnce you know your partner has DNA fragmentation, your IVF lab can use a special procedure during ivf to sort these broken guys out, lowering your risk of ectopics/miscarriages, called PICSI/zymot or just do TESE. \nWe decided on the ivf route because of our currently extremely high chance of miscarriage and ectopic and I cannot physically do another treatment for an ectopic and ruin the few eggs I have left. \nWhether or not you do IVF (because hello, cost), definitely also send your partner to a reproductive urologist to get a culture taken to cure whatever underlying inflammation there may be and check for varicoles. All this can cause DNA fragmentation, and it can be improved!\n\nWell now you know. \nGET YOUR MALE PARTNER'S SPERM TESTED FOR DNA FRAGMENTATION!\n\nIt aggravates me to no end that fertility issues/investigations always seem to be focusing the women, as if nothing could ever be wrong with the dudes. \n\nAnyway, hope my experience can help someone out there, good luck and keep pushing! Don't believe what your doctor is telling you, always double check, and get second and third opinions. \n\nI'll do another write up of all things HSG soon. \nThere aren't enough people talking about fertility issues and it's so nice to have a community to learn from and exchange knowledge and stories. \n\nSource of all this: me, 31F medical student specializing in public health.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my husband and I started TTC, we both got the basic tests done (blood panels, ultrasound and SA) and we both came back normal.\nSo no problem, right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got pregnant on our first try, and bam, ectopic. \nA pretty traumatic one at that because I knew right away something wasn&amp;#39;t right yet the doctor didn&amp;#39;t believe me and waited until I was almost 9 weeks (!!!!!!!!) to send me to a specialist since she couldn&amp;#39;t find a sac or anything in my uterus or tubes and dismissed my requests for earlier ultrasounds.\nThe specialist found the growth in the fimbriae of my left tube right away and a few days later (!!!!

My treatment plan outlining the IVF protocol hasn't even been sitting in my inbox for 24 hours-and is now meaningless. \n\nI don't know the exact details yet of the new plan, it comes into effect in September (and not enough time to try to squeeze a cycle in, plus the smoking issue). But I do know the prescriptions plan is outrageous, the deductible doesn't make sense, and I think it's highly unlikely I can go straight to IVF. \n\nI'm crying all the time and don't know how to not fall in a pit of despair. Husband is trying to quit smoking (or maybe not trying hard enough? Idk).

Today was day 8, and I went in for an ultrasound and blood draw. The results of the ultrasound showed far fewer follicles than the last round, and running the math is causing me to question whether I should continue with this cycle at all, or cut my losses and try again. I could use the advice from all of you wonderful, knowledgeable people who have experienced this too.\n\nSome background:\n\nFirst, on my medical situation- there are two important factors here- the cause of my infertility, and a genetic issue.\n\n* Infertility: My infertility is due to missing tubes, which were removed along with a number of other bits and pieces to save my life when I was a small child. I had undiagnosed appendicitis as a toddler- it ruptured, and infection spread throughout my abdomen, and they had to remove it wherever it went. I am very fortunate and grateful that my ovaries and uterus are intact and healthy. My eggs have been assessed as being good quality, as has my uterus and lining. Again, very, very grateful for that.\n* Sex-Linked Genetic Disorder: When we began IVF, we decided to do ALL the tests we could. My husband is a scientist, I work in systems and data, and we both prefer having as much information as possible. The genetic/compatibility test turned up something totally unexpected - I am a carrier of Hemophilia B, or Christmas disease. As we investigated this further, we found the specific variant I have is severe, and I myself am a symptomatic carrier. Many variants of hemophilia don't present at all in women, but the one I carry is severe enough that it basically shows up as \"hemophilia-light\" in the words of my hematologist. This explains a lot of things myself, my mother, and my maternal grandmother have experienced- the constant bruising, the life-long anemia, and the very protracted, heavy periods. Given the severity of the variant and the impact it could have on any children, we are moving forward with specific testing to determine carrier status in our embryos. It's a 50-50 chance of being a carrier, which means a 50% further cut to our viable embryos, most likely. A further complication here- both my husband and I are very nervous about male children as a result. The genetic test is 97% accurate, but that means 1 in 30 times, the test will provide a false negative. In a female child, that will be manageable. In a male child, it will be massively life-impacting or even deadly. We aren't sure we want to take that risk, though we're still discussing it.\n\nOne other key bit of background- my last cycle. Just before Covid set in and shut everything down for a bit, we did our first round of IVF in March. At the same point I am at now (Day 8 of the cycle) I had 21 follicles. Subsequently, they were able to retrieve 16 eggs, of which 12 were mature, 10 fertilized, leading to 5 total embryos, of which 3 where chomosomally normal. Of those three, we can assume 50% likely carry hemophilia, which takes us down to 1.5. If I compare that to the original 21 follicles on Day 8, that is a 7% success rate. Depending on how we decide to proceed or not with males, given the risk, that potentially gets cut down to 3.5%.\n\nSo, fast forward to today: In my Day 8 check this morning, there were 8 viable follicles. There is one additional one, but it's already \"ahead\" of the others, and the RE says it will not yield a viable egg as a result, and the focus is thus on the remaining \"cohort\" of 8. If I multiply that by my 7%/3.5% success rate, that's going to put me at .5/.25 viable embryos. Those numbers don't seem good, to me- it means 1 viable embryo at best, and possibly not even that. I'm wondering if it would be better to terminate this cycle and try again.\n\nThere have been some key differences this cycle- one, we started two days later against my menstrual cycle, due to a miscommunication on the part of the clinic coordinator (very frustrated about that, still). Additionally, my RE put me on a higher dose of Gonal this time around. Last time, she started me at 150 each day, which lead to steady growth, but a longer cycle in which she upped me to 200 for the last two days. This time she started directly at 200, and I'm wondering if that is the reason for the more uneven growth this time around.\n\nSo, if I could get the benefit of your experience and advice- am I just grasping at straws thinking another cycle will turn out better? Should I just proceed with the current one given the numbers? Am I being excessive or over-anxious here?\n\nGetting out of the math and analysis for a moment- I also just feel extremely sad and disappointed and am questioning everything I've done since the cycle started. It's really gotten to me, badly, and I wonder if that's slanting my judgement.\n\nI would appreciate any insight you can give!\n\nCLARIFICATION UPDATES:\n\n\\- Baseline follicles counts from the last cycle to this one were closer, but the second cycle was lower - 23 and 20 respectively.\n\n\\- We have to do a specifically-designed test on the existing DNA samples to locate my specific variant of hemophilia (PGT-M). That test is still in design, and anticipated to be ready right around when any embryos from this new cycle would be ready for testing. The plan is to run the specific PGT-M test on both the previous 3 embryos and any new ones the same time that we do PGT-A for the new cycle.\n\n\\- We can possibly afford to do another cycle if we do it this year, but that's not a surety. We are very, fortunate that our insurance covers some of the IVF treatment, but only after we hit our out of pocket maximum, which is pretty steep. We did hit that with our first cycle, which means more of this is covered now. However, hitting it again if we head into a new year would be a stretch. Additionally, our clinic required a high up-front deposit for each cycle. Depending on what we can or can't salvage from the budget from this one, making the deposit again may be a stretch, given how long the return from the insurance company takes to process once things are billed back.\n\n\\- We would be grateful for 1 child, and don't have aspirations beyond that.\n\n*Edited to fix wording issue/typo.*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19181, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My thoughts are spinning coming out of my appointment, and I could use some advice.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/htko76/my_thoughts_are_spinning_coming_out_of_my/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595099112, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/htm3f7/saturday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "htm3f7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Daily", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 195, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/htm3f7/saturday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1595203877, "score": 10, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!

I\u2019m new here and hoping someone can help me understand what\u2019s going on. \n\nI just got out of hospital after spending most of the last week there with the very vague news I have bilateral hydrosalpinx. I was admitted with intense pain and they found it right away on an ultrasound which, I\u2019m given to understand, is slightly unusual? I don\u2019t know. They have no idea what caused it and don\u2019t care. I have been given absolutely no information about it at all. Google informs me that my fertility is pretty much fucked and this aligns with the doctor\u2019s surprise that we have a son. I\u2019m also confused because one of the doctors said there was something wrong with my ovary and then this was never mentioned again. I have a follow up scan in 3 months. \n\nIt took us a while to have our son and a couple of miscarriages along the way but we had put this down to my husband being diagnosed as technically infertile due to very low semen morphology and a pituitary tumour. \n\nDoes this mean infertility for me? Has anyone else been through this? Can it ever become dangerous? I know that last question probably sounds stupid and paranoid and I am because someone dear to me is currently battling ovarian cancer only in her thirties and a lot of my symptoms were the same to begin with. \n\nSorry for the huge personal info dump.

Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\n23 y/o Female, overweight (BMI of 49 currently), type 2 diabetic--\n\nHusband and I got married a year ago (July 2019), and have been trying ever since (currently on cycle 12). We are young but stable and very ready. I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 15, just diagnosed with diabetes 6 months ago. I have had regular, 28 day cycles ever since I got my period for the first time. I have a history of cysts, but none currently.\n\nI've been working with a dietitian and have lost nearly 40 pounds since January 2020, though she will not discuss trying to conceive at all because she thinks I should lose all the weight first, and that I am too young.\n\nAlternatively, my OB/GYN and primary say it is fine to proceed since my A1C (blood sugar) is stable. Met with my OB/gyn last month, had an ultrasound which only showed a small fibroid and so she suggested 3 options we could use going forward:\n\n1- Clomid (50mg, day 5-9) with progesterone testing on CD 21; or Femara.\n\n2- HSG\n\n3- Sperm Analysis\n\nWe decided to go forward with a round of Clomid, and on CD 21 my progesterone level was only 10. Not pregnant this month. Dr. recommended to move up to 100 mg this next round. I am pretty devastated because I let myself hope this month.\n\nWe currently have excellent health insurance that will cover all 3, but are considering an out of state move, which would leave us without infertility related coverage.\n\nOn to my questions:\n\n1: Anyone have info on what an appropriate progesterone level on CD 21 would be? My DR is on vacation so I have no real info on that.\n\n2: If you're overweight, how has that impacted your fertility journey/experience, and any advice?\n\n3: Do you think we should push to have a HSG and sperm analysis done before we move since it would be covered? There's really no indication it would be either of those things causing issues but it might be nice to rule out before losing coverage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19212, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "First Round of Clomid was unsuccessful", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.36, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/huc4uk/first_round_of_clomid_was_unsuccessful/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595217155, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/huefa4/acupuncture_to_help_infertility/", "gildings": {}, "id": "huefa4", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/huefa4/acupuncture_to_help_infertility/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1595301941, "score": 0, "selftext": "[deleted]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19217, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Acupuncture to help infertility?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/huefa4/acupuncture_to_help_infertility/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "The_Legend_of_Chris", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2xdj6b99", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595226966, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/hughtd/my_gf_24_hasnt_had_a_period_in_about_year_thyroid/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hughtd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1ae87cfc-92a6-11e4-8e5a-22000b26873e", "link_flair_text": "Treatment Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 24, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/hughtd/my_gf_24_hasnt_had_a_period_in_about_year_thyroid/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1595309460, "score": 0, "selftext": "She's always had irregular periods, usually having about 3 a year.\n\nShe came off birth control last year in June and had a period in September. \n\nWe then got pregnant in November but miscarried in December.\n\nAfter a few tests, it turned out my GF has an underactive thyroid and began taking levothyroxine 50mg in March of this year.\n\nIn May, she had her bloods done and her thyroid level was 12 which was really high.

New to this forum...actually new to posting anything remotely private about myself, but I am looking for a positive and understanding community that may have experienced the same circumstance as myself. I\u2019m 35 (36 soonish) with no history of endometriosis, fibroids, etc. I have had the occasional cyst with no remarkable findings. I have never used birth control, all of my infertility lab work came back as being in the normal range (AMH was a little low at 1.4, but the doctor told me that was okay), a HyCoSy was performed showing no abnormalities (ovaries movable with no remarkable findings, uterus was good and Fallopian tubes are open). My husband\u2019s semen analysis came back and all the results were great. My periods and ovulation cycles are textbook (28 days/14 days) and we have intercourse regularly. I am relatively healthy. I eat fairly well, rarely drink (maybe once a month), no drug use or smoking, I am 5\u20197 at 125lb, walking my dog is my exercise, and I do not have any medical conditions. My stress levels could be better (A few years ago I decided to make a career change and decided to go to nurse school - it was a pretty major stress factor, but I\u2019m in my last semester and I\u2019m feeling less strain). We have been trying to conceive for almost a year without any success. I am so sick of listening to family members saying \u201cjust relax and it will happen\u201d, \u201cit will happen when it\u2019s meant to be\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re being too sensitive\u201d, etc. I am reaching out because of one main reason...my emotional breakdowns. A couple months ago my brother-in-law announced that his wife is expecting their first child and instead of smiles, I felt tears rolling down my cheeks. I was happy for them, but felt sorry for myself. It was so embarrassing for me, yet I couldn\u2019t get ahold of my feelings. Each month that passes and I get my period I become distraught and inconsolable. My husband is so supportive and wants nothing but my happiness and I don\u2019t ever want to push him away because of all of this. Each month I try to maintain a positive outlook and convince myself that I\u2019m pregnant, but then I feel a cramp and I feel myself going down a dark path.
