I found a clinic where the RE had good reviews, and I liked her when I met her for an IVF consult. However, my insurance denied my IVF coverage\u2014this was in early May.

When I hadn\u2019t heard back about 3 weeks later, I called my insurance, and they said they hadn\u2019t received any paperwork for IUI.

Yesterday I called and talked to someone who said the insurance requested more information, and they were working on it. \n\nToday, amazingly, I get a letter in the mail from my insurance stating that my request to *convert from an IUI cycle to IVF* had been denied. I\u2019m not even undergoing any treatment cycle right now because I\u2019ve been waiting for this godforsaken authorization to be decided! So obviously they never sent in the paperwork in May, and then when I contacted them the second time (based on the date of the letter), they sent the wrong paperwork.\n\nI\u2019m seriously considering going back to my local clinic for the time being and then seeking a different larger clinic.

Thats for me to discuss with my fertility doctor at the end of this month. Another user mentioned it could be that my day 3 bloods weren\u2019t \u2018proper day 3s\u2019 which makes some sense, as I haven\u2019t ovulated since January so all of my \u2018bleeds\u2019 haven\u2019t been proper periods. \n\nAs many of you already know, the reason for my meeting with the doctor is to start IVF. However, I\u2019ve since found out that if your FSH is high, you can be rejected from IVF and told to either find another clinic that will treat you, or you\u2019re just shit out of luck and won\u2019t ever be able to do IVF. \nIVF is our only option because my husband has no sperm that swims. \n\nMy fertility clinic has a forum (I can\u2019t use it however as nobody bloody posts to it haha) and I did a key word search of FSH and found another lady who posted back in 2011 saying that our clinic had allowed her to be a part of an \u2018egg sharing\u2019 scheme and her FSH was 10.5. \n2011 was many years ago though so I don\u2019t know if this is still accurate. \n\nI\u2019m driving myself mental with worry. I can\u2019t call my clinic until Monday as they\u2019re closed on weekends and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d just tell me to wait and see my doctor at the end of next week anyway. \n\nDoes anyone know if high FSH is grounds for me to be refused an IVF package? \n\nThank you.

Back story, I\u2019m 39 and I severely have diminished ovarian reserve.  This was our 7th IVF cycle and first transfer. My 6th one, went to egg retrieval but nothing retrieved due to fibroids. Previous cycles were all cancelled due to not responding to meds and ovulating on my own. Not too mention my previous RE had me extremely suppressed and not on right protocols.  We switched and had \u201csuccess\u201d with our new Dr.   Stims consisted of dhea, coq10, Accupunture, eliminate animal diary and exercise. 3 mature eggs retrieved, 2 PGS normal high quality embryos.\n\nOur first FET resulted in a negative beta and we only have one embryo left from this cycle. My lining was thick and my doctor had me on Medrol, antibiotic, progesterone shots, endometrin and estrogen. Needless to say, I was upset over the negative result. I got badly sick the day after transfer and was miserable up until the blood test. So part of me of knew it wasn\u2019t going to stick. \n\nI have my appointment next week with my Dr. I\u2019m going to push for an ERA test even if he doesn\u2019t believe in it but with one embryo left; I\u2019m terrified of losing that one too. What else could have gone wrong? Something immune related? This clinic has a high success rate with frozen embryo transfers so I\u2019m kind of ticked.

I also had a miscarriage after getting pregnant off Clomid about 2.5 years ago, so I\u2019m now getting an RPL panel and being sent to a MFM for a consult. Until now we\u2019ve been unexplained, although with slightly crappy eggs for me and slightly low morphology numbers for Mr. Pumpkin. We now have one PGS normal embryo remaining.\n\nA bit more background: I have a few autoimmune issues: rheumatoid arthritis, a shellfish allergy (with anaphylactic reaction), and recently started getting exercise-induced hives. My RA is well-controlled with Humira, which I\u2019ve stayed on through this most recent pregnancy at the advice of my rheumatologist.\n\nNow for the odd part. About two weeks after my first miscarriage, a routine physical found elevated eosinophils in my blood (&gt;2,000cells/uL). Apparently this can be caused by a reaction to a medicine, a parasite, or several other things. I was sent to my allergist (they had no idea), and also a hematologist, who eventually did a bone marrow biopsy to rule out leukemia (negative, thank goodness). This eventually resolved itself after a few months. It was never clear to me whether this was due to the pregnancy, the miscarriage, or the misoprostol/Cytotec that I took (or something else entirely, suspiciously timed around the pregnancy).\n\nI\u2019ve kept an eye on my blood work results since then, but have had no abnormalities\u2026until I got finally pregnant again this past month. I insisted on them drawing CBCs every time they were poking around in my veins:) This time around,\u00a0at 5 weeks I had a CBC that found white blood cells (14.3k), neutrophils (8280), lymphocytes (4447), and monocytes (1044) all slightly elevated, but I'm told this isn't uncommon during pregnancy. Eosinophils were 472, just within \u2018normal\u2019. I also had a CBC drawn at 7 weeks (when the lack of growth was confirmed and supporting progesterone and estrogen withdrawn, but BEFORE I took Cytotec) with some significantly higher values: white blood cells (16.0k), neutrophils (9536), lymphocytes (4704), monocytes (1024), and also eosinophils (656). All other values are in normal range. I do not have any other signs of an infection, and my RE is confident I don't have one.\n\nI had always been suspicious that the elevated eosinophils 2 years ago were caused by the pregnancy, but now I\u2019m relatively certain of this. I\u2019m a scientist (non-medical), and I\u2019ve done quite a bit of research into this but haven\u2019t been able to find any studies or even occurrences of this problem. I have wondered if my body recognizes the pregnancy as a 'parasite' or other foreign body, and my immune system doesn't switch off like it ought to? I\u2019ve been wondering if I may be a good candidate for seeing a reproductive immunologist (my RE doesn\u2019t subscribe, but is willing to let me look into it on my own)? I\u2019ve also wondered whether this type of abnormal blood reaction actually makes it dangerous for me to get pregnant (long-term elevated eosinophils can cause organ damage)?\n\nAny thoughts or ideas for me are much appreciated. Thanks for slogging through this long post, and for all the love and support I\u2019ve gotten from you all.

If you haven\u2019t been following me, I\u2019m 23 and have an FSH of 10 despite a \u2018good\u2019 AMH and \u2018good\u2019 AFC.\nI also have PCOS. Male factor infertility has lead us to seek out IVF.\n\nMy family doctor offered to do me some routine hormonal blood tests for our private referral to the fertility clinic we are now at. This is where I found out I have a high FSH. \n\nNow my theory. \nI\u2019ve not ovulated since January of this year. With my PCOS my body tends to always be trying to ovulate. I will have one good month where I do ovulate and then inevitably get a proper period as my husband doesn\u2019t manage to get me pregnant. I will then go on a long string of months where my ovaries constantly try to release an egg but fail to do so. My OPKs will remain positive (or near enough positive) and I\u2019ll even get ovulation pain and cervical mucus that looks as though it\u2019s about to change to Egg whites, but it never makes that transition. So my body gets stuck in a loop of constantly trying to pump an egg out.\n\nSome months I get breakthrough bleeding. This is when my family doctor took my FSH and other hormone levels, on day 3 of a \u2018bleed\u2019 but not a proper period. \nAnd the strangest thing about this break through bleeding is my body still attempts to ovulate even when I\u2019m bleeding!! I\u2019ve been known to ovulate on CD6 because I was never having a proper period in the first place. \n\nMy theory is that this is why my FSH May be as high. I don\u2019t personally believe I\u2019m low on ovarian reserve. I know FSH tends to be higher during certain stages of your menstrual cycle and at its lowest during your period. But how does this work for a woman who does not get proper periods? My hormones are never in line anymore. The only time they briefly fall into line is when I\u2019ve managed to ovulate. \n\nI\u2019m posting this here as I\u2019m wondering what you guys think about my theory? I\u2019ve been very worried about my FSH, as you all know, for a few days now. I called my clinic today and asked them about it and they said they usually don\u2019t even test FSH anymore as it\u2019s \u2018highly unreliable\u2019 and they tend to go off of AMH and AFC. The only thing they wanted me to bring in to my consultation next week was proof of my rubella immunity and STD tests - all come back clear of course. They told me I can take along my FSH results but they don\u2019t often test for FSH themselves and apparently most clinics don\u2019t rely on it anymore.\nHas anyone else heard of clinics doing this rather than the traditional FSH/LH? \n\nI\u2019m also posting here because another user was having similar issues to myself and maybe this will shed some potential light for her too, or anyone else with strangely high FSH but a regular AFC And AMH.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13332, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Theory about my high ass FSH levels", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560778520, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/c19yb1/theory_about_my_high_ass_fsh_levels/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "coca_evagria", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zb09f0q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560693354, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/c1a4xe/anybody_have_hyperplasia_of_the_uterine_lining_if/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c1a4xe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/c1a4xe/anybody_have_hyperplasia_of_the_uterine_lining_if/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1560693355, "score": 5, "selftext": "What would you all do in my case. \n\nJune 2018 - had a endometrial biopsy as part of my fertility treatments.

It was an invaluable recommendation and I can\u2019t thank everyone here enough. I thought I\u2019d post an update here for anyone interested. Hugs to you all on your journey. \n\nMy spouse and I are male factor infertile and won\u2019t be trying any further fertility treatments. It\u2019s a decision we\u2019ve put off for several reasons but child free is our realistic future. My in laws never dealt well with my spouse\u2019s DX and swept it under the rug like it never happened. My mother in law told me she didn\u2019t feel bad for us because she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d pass a gene on to my husband. Fine, but you don\u2019t need to say it while you\u2019re driving me to an IVF appointment. When I miscarried, nobody said a word or made a call. Spouse and I spent years dealing with our pain alone. \n\nFast forward to this year and my sister in law becomes pregnant. I was polite but emotionally distant during this time; I did not attend her baby shower (but sent a thoughtful gift and note) and stayed relatively away unless there was a function I couldn\u2019t avoid. This was not well received and I was called \u201cmean\u201d by my sister in law. \n\nThe baby was born a few months ago. I haven\u2019t seen it yet because I\u2019m not ready. For some reason, this baby is just too close to home for me. It has triggered all the issues I\u2019ve had to deal with in my marriage related to infertility and his family\u2019s treatment of me (my previous post history has more detail.) And I am too scared that seeing a baby that even remotely resembles my husband (his sister\u2019s kid) will destroy me and I\u2019ll break down sobbing. \n\nThis also has not been well received. We\u2019ve been attacked by two of his siblings, including the sister who had the baby. We have been called selfish, cruel, mean, horrible, you name it. We\u2019ve been threatened that we are destroying the family. Guilted that we\u2019ve abandoned them. I\u2019ve been told by my brother in law (via my spouse) to grow up and get over it. He told my spouse \u201cadopt, or do IVF until it works. Otherwise you need to fake it for our sister.\u201d For months now. I remain \u201cno comment\u201d and my husband occasionally falls victim to emotional hoop jumping but for the most part we\u2019ve held strong. \n\nWe have also been seeing an infertility therapist who has been a lifesaver; she considers his family to be severely enmeshed, willfully ignorant of our struggle and that his sister is behaving like a brat. She is horrified at my brother in law\u2019s comments and says he has no place at this table whatsoever. She also thinks based on some family history we disclosed, that perhaps this baby was born for a fix it reason, and our infertility issues are somehow \u201cmessing things up\u201d for my sister in law. She insists that until they leave us alone we can\u2019t work on our issues which prevent me from being around this baby in the first place. We have asked countless times for them to give us space and they refuse. Which leads to the subject of this post.\n\nSpouse and I are going on a trip in ten days with his family. The planning of it was absolutely mishandled; my mother in law tried to suppress that my sister in law and her baby would be on the same plane and in the same villa as we were staying. When we found out, we politely declined to go, stating we weren\u2019t comfortable with such intimacy yet. So my mother in law accommodated us by moving us to the front of the plane and getting spouse and I our own place. Very nice to do - I should state they are significantly wealthy at this point; things I would consider a big deal, like moving our seats and getting us a place, are like asking to pass the salt. \n\nSo we haven\u2019t met the baby because of our struggles, their relentless bullying and our inability to have space and time with our therapist to work on things. Every session is a discussion of the most recent attack. My mother in law (who has remained mostly neutral) suggested a brief sort of run in with my sister in law and the baby. A public place, a quick hello and goodbye. That way, we get the actual seeing of the baby out of the way quickly and we can be alone to process. I thought this seemed like a reasonable idea, because I\u2019m a nervous flyer and the stress of seeing the baby for the first time in the terminal would not be great for me. So we agreed to set something up. \n\nMy spouse attempted to schedule this meeting with his sister. We were feeling positive about taking a step for us, getting the scary part over of seeing this kid and being able to enjoy the trip. But my sister in law refused unless I have a conversation with her, where she can tell me how everything I\u2019ve done, or didn\u2019t do, has hurt her, and she expects me to tell her how I have been hurting. \n\nThis conversation is never going to happen. Firstly, because she was balls out hostile and attacking towards me, and my spouse told her I\u2019m not interested in ANY conversation without an apology. She has refused, saying she doesn\u2019t need to apologize \u201cfor you guys hurting me.\u201d She also doesn\u2019t understand that she has no seat at this table and continues to make this about herself. She\u2019s been told in clear terms this is private and we will not be discussing it with anyone. And yet she continues to harp that she \u201cneeds to hear an explanation\u201d for why I didn\u2019t go to her shower, and that she really needs to tell me how she feels. Oh, but she \u201cwon\u2019t do it in a way that makes me feel bad or anything.\u201d \ud83d\ude10 So she gets all the freedom to act and say as she pleases, but I do not. \n\nSo my spouse told her our terms for meeting the kid were non negotiable; quick, light and casual. She refused and then said I\u2019m not allowed around \u201cher baby\u201d until I agree to speak with her. However, because my spouse \u201cmade an effort to make her feel better\u201d he is fully permitted to see the kid. Spouse told her the only way we see the kid is according to the terms we set. She hung up. \n\nFriends, I\u2019m weary. First I was a liability for not seeing the kid and now I\u2019m a liability if I do. This family (mostly siblings, spouse\u2019s parents have been silent and on good terms) has been so terrible since this all started and I\u2019ve reached a place where I no longer care for them in my life. My spouse is breaking down because he feels torn; it\u2019s become something so much bigger now with their behavior and he\u2019s facing \u201chard truths\u201d about his family. At one point, we considered just him going to see the kid, but he is against this now because his family is clearly looking to divide us and vilify me. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with a terrible response to your infertility?

I am not infertile. But I want to help. Literally anyone who I can help with their wish to have a child, would make me so happy. \n\nI am in The Netherlands and want to donate my eggs. As many as I can. I would donate all my eggs if I could. But I read you can only donate about 5 to 10 each round. \n\nJust something I want to mention is that I am not doing it for finances, in my country you don't get anything for donating eggs besides your medical expenses covered. I just want to help.\n\nI've reached out to the only hospital in this country that extracts and stores eggs. They have not gotten back to me yet. But I find it hard to find information outside of a few generic links about the process. \n\nI am certain I don't want any more children. I am 24 years old and in good shape. \n\nI have one issue. I have a possibly inherited kidney disease. Not so much as an disease than a malformation. My left kidney is a double kidney, basically two tubes. A non-invasive surgery fixed this. Robotic arm inserted through urethra with a sillicone ball to block one of the tubes originating from left kidney. None of my children have it. \n\nI also have light autism (asperger syndrome).\n\nThe website indicates you can not donate if you have any diseases that can be inherited. I am so devastated. I want to help people have children. I don't need my eggs anymore. I wish they could just take them all out and help as many couples as they can. My questions are as follows:\n\nIs there a certain way I can get them to test my eggs for this kidney malformation? \n\nIs there a possibility to donate multiple times? How many eggs are usually donated in one round? (I know it depends on hormones and such, but an estimate would be amazing)\n\nIs there a possibility that you can donate even if you have a so called mental \"handicap\"? (Autism). I can't find any information on this. \n\nAre there any women here who went through this process and had success? I read the success rates are fairly low and it bothers me. It won't stop me from donating, even if it's only a 1% chance I would still donate. \n\nI've also read about embryo donation. Is this where they insaminate the egg after donating or can you grow an embryo for someone, then transfer it from my uterus to another womans uterus? \n\nI would also be interested in being a surrogate, but I don't know any people that I could help. I want to know is there any subs on reddit? \n\nI'm so sorry if this isn't the right place to look. I'm so eager to start the whole process and want to make sure I do it right.

We are avid divers and beach bums, and a trip like this would be so restorative for me. Since Zika clears the female system in two months, I can't help but wonder if this is our opportunity to hop a plane to Thailand or even just Mexico? Is it crazy to think we could go, come back and be clear of any exposure by the time we were ready to transfer? All opinions welcome, but I'm really hoping you all tell me I'm not completely crazy.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13356, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "zika before transfer?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560982619, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/c28qhn/zika_before_transfer/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "tsb0673", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_23aj4b7j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560900566, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/c29iy1/infertility_runs_in_our_families_but_my_medical/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c29iy1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d01d325e-18e2-11e9-9639-0e9becdb220e", "link_flair_text": "Emotional Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/c29iy1/infertility_runs_in_our_families_but_my_medical/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1560900567, "score": 39, "selftext": "As stated above, infertility runs in both his family and mine.

I have had suspicions of this for years, but I had always held out hope that I was wrong. Today, those fears were confirmed.\n\nDespite the infertility we likely would have struggled with (We were waiting to attempt conception for another 5-8 years.), we have no safe option to even try. After lengthy conversations today, we have come to the decision to have my tubes ligated. The problems both for any baby I might have been able to carry and for me are too great. The effects due to an accidental pregnancy would be even worse.\n\nBecause of my medical condition, we would have to do IVF, no matter what. There\u2019s no other semi-safe option for a child. And there is no safe way for me to carry. If we ever want children, we will have to adopt or find a surrogate.\n\nMost of me, especially the academic part, is fine with this because it has known for years.

I recently visited a fertility specialist after taking a Modern Fertility at-home test and receiving \"abnormal results.\" I went and got blood work done at the doctor and my levels are slightly better but still very low. I'm wondering if anyone had similar levels and what their experience has been like with the process.\n\nI'm 32 so I (stupidly) thought I had at least a year or two until me and my husband would have to start trying. Here's the levels for what I see as the big markers (they tested like a million things but these seem the most familiar to me from the MF tests):\n\n* Estradiol: 12.75 pg/mL\n* FSH: 10.41 mIU/mL\n* AMH: .169 ng/mL\n* LH: 8.67 mIU/mL\n\nI hadn't really had time to look into these results and they haven't been discussed with me. I think we are discussing them after my hysteroscopy, which is scheduled this week. I started googling around and everything is pointing to premature ovarian failure, which is devastating to me. However, I don't know why my doctor would continue with this surgery if that was the case.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has had similar levels, what treatment you had to undergo and ultimately if it was successful? I'm under an extreme level of stress each day and am trying to minimize that, but as I continue to try it just gets worse knowing that a future family depends on it (if that makes any sense at all).\n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13356, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Blood Work Levels and Hysteroscopy (cross posted to r/IVF)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560987696, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/c29nlz/blood_work_levels_and_hysteroscopy_cross_posted/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "UnicornMuffinz", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "26F / 3 yrs TTC / MFI / 1st IVF in July", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3x7y733e", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560902703, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/c29w8l/statistics_on_cumulative_ivf_cycle_success_rates/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c29w8l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/c29w8l/statistics_on_cumulative_ivf_cycle_success_rates/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1560902704, "score": 5, "selftext": "Hey guys, maybe one of you can answer this question.

My partner is 30 with MFI. His sperm doesn\u2019t swim fast. He has 32% that are motile but they\u2019re all \u2018slow progressive\u2019 \n\nWe\u2019ve been trying since I was 20.\n\nI saw my fertility doctor today. He initially advised IUI but we refused this. We don\u2019t want to pay \u00a31,400 for a medicated IUI cycle when it only has a 15% success rate and that rate would probably be less with my husbands sperm.\n\nWe only have \u00a311,000 of savings to work with. We can borrow more from his family, his dad has a lot of money - but it isn\u2019t preferred if we can help it. \n\nMy AMH came back fine but strangely, not indicative of PCOS. My AFC is also pretty high at 21 follicles. \n\nI\u2019ve been posting about my FSH a lot recently - this wasn\u2019t mentioned until we got to info about the shared risk program and the doctor looked through my paperwork. He said with an FSH of 10 the shared risk program would likely only offer us a 50% refund package. \n\nI asked him to elaborate on this.\n\nHe said that we would pay the shared risk program provider \u00a39,500 (this includes medication) and we\u2019d get two cycles of IVF. If both cycles failed we\u2019d get a refund of half \u00a39,500. So \u00a34,750.\nHe said if I got pregnant via the first cycle of IVF none of that money would be returned, of course. \n\nThe other option was to pay \u00a33,500 for one cycle of IVF including medication but the money would not be refunded if this one cycle failed. \n\nSo now I\u2019m stuck in a dilemma. I need your advice. Is it worth trying just one cycle for \u00a33,500, that won\u2019t be refunded if it fails, or is it worth dishing out \u00a39,500 for a 50% refund package? It\u2019s constant what if what if what if.\n\nThe consultant said that due to my age one cycle \u2018might be all is needed\u2019 as they hope to get quite a few eggs out of me, but I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nMy husband personally wants to go for the \u00a33,500 package but I think thats because he\u2019s thinking of money. He isn\u2019t fully clued up on how IVF works and how it\u2019s not likely to succeed the first time statistically. \n\nThe consultant told us to take some time to come to a decision and if we choose the shared risk program he will compile a medical report to send to the providers. He said they could even offer a higher shared risk package but he can\u2019t tell me for sure due to the fact my FSH is a little off. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t personally concerned about my FSH, for anyone wondering how that turned out. He said my AMH and AFC matter far more than the FSH hormone in determining ovarian reserve. He just said he thinks the shared risk program providers may not be happy about it being as high. There is the option for me to do a medicated cycle of clomid and then have proper day 3s taken when I inevitably come on my period, but we aren\u2019t sure if we want to do this. \u00a3500 for a medicated cycle just to get some day 3 bloods when my AMH and AFC are already good just seems as though we are throwing money down the drain. My husband unfortunately has issues with his sperm, as I\u2019ve mentioned, so a medicated cycle would prove no more useful than all the sex we\u2019ve had over the past 3 years. \n\nAdvice would be great!

She was 32, weighed 317 pounds and had been trying to get pregnant since soon after she and her husband, Nick, married in 2010. Balzano \u2014 whom I have known since high school \u2014 lives in Waltham, Mass., and works in special education. She\u2019s the kind of person whom others often go to with their problems, but her own predicament, after three years of negative pregnancy tests, had left her feeling overwhelmed. \u201cI\u2019ve always had horrible, heavy, painful periods, so I thought something was wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know enough to know what to worry about.\u201d She told herself it was time to find out.\n\nThe couple braced themselves to hear some painful truths about fertility treatments. On average, a single cycle of in vitro fertilization costs between $10,000 and $15,000 \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t include medications, follow-up visits or the expenses of prenatal care and childbirth. Just 10 states have a law requiring insurance companies to pay for I.V.F., and that coverage varies. The couple also knew that the experience of undergoing fertility treatments would be emotionally draining. And Balzano expected to hear about her size. She didn\u2019t have any of the health conditions often associated with a high body weight; her blood pressure and cholesterol levels were normal, and she didn\u2019t have diabetes or other chronic ailments. Nevertheless, it was the rare doctor who didn\u2019t raise the subject. \u201cWhen you\u2019re fat, you get used to people assuming weight loss will fix everything wrong in your life,\u201d Balzano says.\n\nConception requires four events to unfold perfectly: An ovary must release an egg; a sperm must reach and fertilize that egg; the fertilized egg must then travel through a woman\u2019s fallopian tube and into her uterus; and finally, it must remain in the uterus, anchored in place, as it grows into a healthy fetus. Infertility results when something goes amiss during any of these steps. Reproductive endocrinologists \u2014 ob-gyns who have undergone training in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility \u2014 can facilitate the process by stimulating ovulation with drugs. If that doesn\u2019t work, they can artificially inseminate patients or they can remove both sperm and egg, produce an embryo in a lab (the \u201cin vitro\u201d part of I.V.F.) and implant it back into a woman\u2019s uterus.\n\nDuring their first appointment at a large Boston fertility clinic, Balzano says, the reproductive endocrinologist was cold and unsmiling as she reviewed the couple\u2019s medical history. Her first question was whether Balzano was ovulating. Irregular ovulation \u2014 when a woman\u2019s ovaries fail to release eggs during the appropriate phase of the menstrual cycle \u2014 is one of the most common causes of infertility. Balzano wasn\u2019t sure; it was difficult to track her erratic cycles at home. The specialist asked no follow-up questions. \u201cIt\u2019s your weight,\u201d she said.\n\nThe doctor, Balzano was convinced, had reduced her to a single characteristic. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wait, wait, wait, there might be something else wrong,\u2019\u2009\u201d she recalls. \u201cMy mom isn\u2019t morbidly obese, but she only had one pregnancy, and she was never on birth control. Couldn\u2019t there be something else going on here?\u201d Nick was furious. \u201cI know plenty of larger women who have been pregnant without any problems,\u201d he says. \u201cThis didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d But they both say the doctor, who declined my interview request on the basis of patient confidentiality, was adamant. \u201cI would never give you I.V.F.,\u201d they recall her saying. \u201cYou\u2019re too fat. Have more sex and lose the weight.\u201d\n\nAlthough Balzano didn\u2019t know it when she made the appointment, the clinic that would have performed the procedure had a policy against providing I.V.F. to patients with a body mass index above 45; Gina\u2019s was 51.2. In that decision, it followed much of the fertility industry, including half of the 20 largest clinics in the United States, according to FertilityIQ, an online clearinghouse of information on fertility providers nationwide. At some clinics, the cutoff for treatment is a B.M.I. of 50, often classified as \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d obesity (roughly 300 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman). At others, it\u2019s much lower. Chelsea Ritchie, now the mother of twins in Ham Lake, Minn., got a call from a nurse the day before her initial appointment with a fertility doctor in 2011. \u201cShe said, \u2018The doctor only sees patients with a B.M.I. under 30, so you\u2019ll need to lose 22 pounds,\u2019\u2009\u201d Ritchie recalls. (The doctor told me that his cutoff for seeing patients is actually a B.M.I. of 35, though he won\u2019t do I.V.F. unless they\u2019re under 30. Ritchie subsequently conceived her twins after going to a different clinic.) B.M.I. doesn\u2019t factor in gender, age or muscle mass, all of which influence body composition and health. But the World Health Organization adopted the B.M.I. scale as an official classification in 1995, and it has since become medicine\u2019s standard metric for categorizing patients by weight. A B.M.I. of 30 or above is classified as \u201cobese,\u201d the word still used by doctors, researchers and the media, although surveys of larger patients show that most consider it derogatory; many now reclaim the once-offensive \u201cfat.\u201d\n\nThe belief that a high body weight causes infertility, and its corollary \u2014 that weight loss is necessary to resolve infertility \u2014 underpin almost every interaction a heavy woman will have with the reproductive health care industry. Yet the specialty\u2019s two governing organizations, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, have not established any guidelines on whether treatment should be declined on the basis of weight. And as the percentage of American women categorized as obese has grown to 41.1 percent in 2016 from 25.4 in 1994, some doctors are pushing back against the notion that weight loss should ever be, in effect, a prerequisite for motherhood. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been overexaggerating the benefits of preconception weight loss,\u201d says Dr. Richard S. Legro, a professor of public health services and chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Penn State University. In fact, a fixation on weight may be leading health care astray. \u201cMany providers see a larger woman and say things like, \u2018Don\u2019t eat cheeseburgers,\u2019 even though she\u2019s a vegetarian,\u201d says Sharon Bernecki DeJoy, the director of public health at West Chester University who studies maternity care in the United States. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of recognition of evidence that shows you can be healthy and still have a, quote-unquote, unhealthy B.M.I.\u201d And a lack of recognition that when a heavy person does get sick, it might not be because of weight.\n\nWhen I knew Balzano back in high school, she was a quirky, glitter-covered theater kid who wrote plays about fairy tales. We lost touch for years after graduation, until our early 30s, when we began to run into each other once a year at the New York State Sheep and Wool Festival. The first few times I saw her, she was heavy, just as she had been when we were kids. Then suddenly, in 2016, she was much less so. A few weeks later I learned why. \u201cI cut off 70 percent of my stomach so I could have the chance to be treated for infertility,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nAt the festival, Balzano stocked up on yarn to make tiny sweaters and hats for friends\u2019 babies. During our interviews, we often veered off course while she sorted through my struggles with potty training or tantrum management. Even though I was already a mother and she wasn\u2019t, Balzano had more experience in navigating such milestones through her work as a special-ed teacher. In so many ways, Balzano had been maternal as long as I\u2019ve known her. But motherhood is both an emotional state and an embodied one, and a doctor had said Balzano\u2019s body wasn\u2019t right for the job. In this respect, B.M.I. cutoffs become more than tools to promote patient health. They also become a way in which doctors might be settling the question: Which women\u2019s bodies are worthy of carrying a child?\n\nIn 1952, a pair of Boston physicians published a study in The New England Journal of Medicine titled \u201cThe Relation of Obesity to Menstrual Disturbances.\u201d The authors surveyed 100 women between the ages of 16 and 40 who had been given diagnoses of menstrual disorders and compared their weights with a control group with no reproductive health issues. Forty-three percent of the patients with menstrual disorders weighed 20 percent or more than their \u201cideal weight,\u201d compared with just 13 percent of the control subjects. Their findings, the authors concluded, gave \u201cfactual proof to the clinical impression of the association of obesity and menstrual disturbances.\u201d\n\nEver since, the idea that a high body mass contributes to infertility has been an accepted premise. \u201cThere\u2019s no question \u2014 it\u2019s been validated in a number of studies,\u201d says Alan Penzias, a former surgical director for Boston I.V.F., a national chain of fertility clinics, and an associate professor of reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School. In 2007, researchers combed through data collected on 7,327 pregnancies from 1959 to 1965 and found that it took heavier women a median of one to two months longer to conceive, compared with women with B.M.I.s in the \u201cnormal weight\u201d range. A 2015 study of 1,602 Italian women undergoing I.V.F. found that the bigger women were just as likely to get pregnant, but were more likely to miscarry. All in all, the research shows a correlating decline in successful pregnancy rates as B.M.I. rises.\n\nPenzias\u2019s clinic employs a tiered cutoff system and begins counseling patients about the importance of weight loss when their B.M.I. is 30, though it will still treat women whose B.M.I.s are higher, up to 45. Doctors say prescribing diet and exercise seems to be a logical place to start before moving up the treatment ladder to expensive drugs, blood work, imaging tests and, if a patient\u2019s case warrants I.V.F., at least one minor operation. And whatever stalls ovulation, losing weight often appears to restart it. This was documented by a 1995 study published in the journal Human Reproduction, in which 13 overweight women who were not ovulating were assigned to a weight-loss program. Six months later, they had lost an average of 13.8 pounds, and all but one of them had resumed ovulating. Eleven became pregnant.\n\nTo critics of B.M.I. exclusions, the potential benefits of weight loss are outstripped by how difficult it is for patients to sustain. Studies on dieting show that people lose, at best, 5 to 10 percent of their body weight, and most will regain that within five years. \u201cIf a patient starts with a B.M.I. of 50 and now she\u2019s at 45, does that make much difference?\u201d Legro asks. In the meanwhile, he points out, the patient has lost crucial time. In 2017, when Swedish researchers put 160 high-weight women on a liquid diet for 12 weeks before starting I.V.F., resulting in a median loss of 20 pounds, they were no more likely to conceive than a control group.\n\nSome aspects of fertility treatment can be more complicated for larger patients. Retrieving eggs for I.V.F. requires that a patient be sedated while a doctor uses an ultrasound probe to identify and extract eggs. \u201cWith an obese patient, I sometimes have to go in through her abdomen instead of her vagina, and I might not be able to retrieve as many eggs,\u201d says Rachel Ashby, a reproductive endocrinologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. This lowers the patient\u2019s odds of success.\n\nBut to Linda Bacon, an associate nutritionist at the University of California, Davis, and author of the book \u201cHealth at Every Size,\u201d trying to assess the odds is beside the point, because doctors\u2019 jobs are to treat the patient in front of them. \u201cEven if it is causative (and it may be), people still deserve the right to good health care,\u201d she emailed me to say. \u201cHealth care needs to take care of our lived bodies, regardless of size.\u201d\n\nBalzano believes she would have been annoyed, but far less devastated, if the doctor she saw had explained that their clinic wasn\u2019t set up to handle her case. \u201cThat would have felt kinder and more ethical, but the implication was, \u2018It\u2019s irresponsible of you to want to have a baby at this size,\u2019\u2009\u201d she says. Jen McLellan, an activist and childbirth educator who writes a blog called Plus Size Birth, gets similar stories from her 172,000 Facebook followers: \u201cI have heard from women of size who have been told to abort their babies.\u201d\n\nThis is where the conversation about risk and responsibility turns. It\u2019s no longer about what a woman is willing to inflict on herself \u2014 it\u2019s about whether she might jeopardize her not-yet-conceived offspring. \u201cWe police women over their fitness to become a mother,\u201d DeJoy says. \u201c\u2009\u2018Are you drinking, are you smoking, do you have enough money and a partner?\u2019 And if you\u2019re a larger woman, it\u2019s: \u2018You don\u2019t know how to eat and exercise. You\u2019ll raise that kid to be fat.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\nSo just how dangerous is it for a larger woman to have a baby? \u201cThe majority of the obstetricians we work with have said, \u2018We support you standing up to this,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Dr. Bill Meyer, a founder of Carolina Conceptions, a fertility clinic in Raleigh, N.C. His clinic does not perform I.V.F. on patients with B.M.I.s above 37.5, and it does not prescribe fertility-stimulating medications to patients above 40. He points to how rates of prenatal conditions like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, as well as miscarriages and stillbirths, all increase as a patient\u2019s B.M.I. climbs. Larger patients are at greater risk for airway obstruction and more likely to require intubation. \u201cThis has nothing to do with the fertility side,\u201d Penzias says. \u201cIf they developed a complication under anesthesia, we\u2019d have to transport them to a hospital.\u201d In total, large women undergoing in vitro fertilization are 10 percent less likely to carry a pregnancy to full-term than women with lower B.M.I.s, according to a 2012 analysis of 27 studies.\n\n\u201cYou can try to explain as much as possible to patients,\u201d Meyer says. \u201cBut sometimes you say, \u2018This is the best I can do with informed consent, and I\u2019m just going to have to put my foot down.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\n\u201cInformed consent\u201d is a process doctors use to educate their patients about the potential risks and benefits of treatments so that patients can make reasoned decisions about their care. It\u2019s supposed to foster a partnership between patient and doctor, though doctors are allowed to initiate treatment without informed consent in an emergency, according to the American Medical Association\u2019s code of ethics. The code also states that the doctor\u2019s obligation to respect patient autonomy \u201cdoes not mean that patients should receive specific interventions simply because they (or their surrogates) request them.\u201d The A.M.A. then lists situations where a doctor is allowed to decline treatment, including when the physician \u201clacks the resources to provide safe, competent or respectful care for the individual.\u201d But the code also notes that physicians are not allowed to turn down patients \u201con the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity, or other personal or social characteristics that are not clinically relevant to the individual\u2019s care.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say we understand why maternal weight is associated with\u201d negative outcomes, says Dr. Chloe Zera, a maternal fetal medicine specialist who cares for patients during high-risk pregnancies at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \u201cObesity can require special care, but a majority of women with B.M.I. over 30 don\u2019t have a complicated pregnancy and do have healthy babies.\u201d Even when the risk for complications increases, the frequency of such events remains low. When Stanford University researchers analyzed more than 1.1 million birth records in California, they found the overall prevalence of stillbirths to be five per 1,000 deliveries. Among women with a B.M.I. above 30, the rate ranged from seven to 10 stillbirths per 1,000 deliveries \u2014 as much as a twofold increase, but still a rare event. In comparison, a 2008 evidence review of the relationship between maternal age and stillbirth risk found that thinner women over 35 were also almost twice as likely to have a stillborn delivery compared with their younger counterparts. And the Stanford study could not establish a causal relationship. Stillbirths may correlate with B.M.I. because it may be harder for doctors to detect fetal complications in bigger bodies as a result of technological limitations. Larger women may also receive less careful prenatal care. When researchers analyzed audio recordings of prenatal appointments between 22 providers and 117 pregnant women, they found that providers treating patients with higher B.M.I.s asked them fewer questions about their lifestyle habits and shared less information, according to data published in 2017 in the journal Patient Education and Counseling.\n\nAll that can be said with any confidence, according to Legro, at Penn State, is that \u201cthere is no B.M.I. cut-point above which it is absolutely unsafe to have a pregnancy.\u201d And weight loss does not ensure a safer pregnancy. When Scandinavian researchers linked data on bariatric surgery patients with infant health outcomes, they found that women who went through such procedures were more likely to have preterm deliveries and babies who were small for their gestational age than mothers of any weight who had not undergone the surgery. \u201cPatients are told to lose weight to have a healthy baby,\u201d Legro says. \u201cBut it\u2019s possible that by doing so, you may be at higher risk for complications than you were before.\u201d\n\nOne day when Balzano was 19, she walked out of a gas station and a man in a passing car yelled, \u201cFat bastard!\u201d \u201cThat was the moment when I realized my body was this problem for the entire world,\u201d she recalls. Studies dating back to the 1960s have shown that when children are presented with pictures of other kids with various body types, they rate the fat body as the one they like the least. In 2013, Yale University researchers asked 74 study participants to read a published news article about Canadian physicians who wanted to deny fertility treatments to women with obese B.M.I.s. One-third of the study subjects read the article alongside an image of a large couple eating junk food; the rest saw the same couple sitting on a bench holding hands or no accompanying image. When researchers surveyed the readers, those who had seen the junk food were more likely than the rest to support the doctors\u2019 decision to deny fertility treatment to such patients.\n\nGood health is often equated with being a disciplined person, a responsible citizen, a worthier mother. And stereotypes \u2014 like the assumption that all fat people are gluttonous and willfully large \u2014 can shape our understanding of a person\u2019s health and morality. \u201cWe all have cultural biases, and health care providers are people, too,\u201d DeJoy says. Studies have indicated that doctors across all specialties are more likely to consider an overweight patient uncooperative, less compliant and even less intelligent than a thinner counterpart. An Australian study on prenatal health care found that doctors expressed less sympathy and approval for their larger pregnant patients. \u201cUntil I found my doula and midwife, I had never had a medical professional touch my body with compassion,\u201d says McLellan, who identifies as a fat woman and had a healthy pregnancy. \u201cThat feels normal to a person of size.\u201d\n\nWeight-science researchers are aware of how that lack of compassion can have health consequences. The kind of stigma that women like McLellan and Balzano encounter throughout their lives puts fat people at higher risk for depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. They also have higher blood pressure and higher levels of stress hormones. And many researchers documenting these risks control for B.M.I. when they collect their data. \u201cThis tells us that it\u2019s stigma, rather than one\u2019s weight per se, that contributes to these adverse health outcomes,\u201d says Rebecca Puhl, an author of the 2013 Yale study and the deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. \u201cThis evidence also challenges the notion that stigma will motivate people to lose weight.\u201d\n\nBalzano\u2019s husband, Nick, was eager to get a second opinion right away, but it was two years before she could bring herself to see another doctor. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take another conversation like that,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like this waste of a person.\u201d In private, she sobbed whenever friends announced a pregnancy. Then one friend, who was also heavy, told Balzano that she\u2019d had a good experience at Boston I.V.F. So they made an appointment. When they arrived, a concierge greeted the couple as soon as they walked in. Balzano responded by starting to cry. The place felt too slick and fancy. She was sure she would once again be deemed unfit.\n\nThe doctor listened to Balzano\u2019s story and said she understood how emotional the situation was. But she did want Balzano to lose weight. In the meantime, she was willing to prescribe letrozole, a medication used to promote ovulation, or, if that failed, a course of intrauterine insemination. I.U.I. is a low-risk procedure done without sedation in the doctor\u2019s office; sperm is placed inside the patient\u2019s uterus during ovulation in order to facilitate fertilization. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t seem like she was all that interested in that,\u201d Nick says. \u201cThe impression I got was that nobody thinks anything besides I.V.F. will work, and they wouldn\u2019t give Gina I.V.F.\u201d The doctor told me she recalls that she was \u201ccertainly willing to go ahead with medication and insemination,\u201d but says she counseled Balzano to see a maternal fetal medicine specialist to discuss the potential impact of her weight on a pregnancy. Balzano declined the letrozole: \u201cEssentially, she was saying the same thing as the first doctor \u2014 that nothing would change until I fixed my weight.\u201d\n\nEven when they do receive fertility treatment, women in larger bodies may encounter stigma in how a reproductive endocrinologist approaches their care. Stephanie Robben, 44, and the mother of twin boys in St. Louis, says her doctor didn\u2019t mention her weight \u2014 then 247 pounds \u2014 until the first I.V.F. cycle failed. Then he outlined a daily plan for her: Drink a gallon of water, eat fewer than 900 calories and exercise for an hour. If Robben followed these directions correctly, the doctor expected her to lose 50 pounds in a month, much more than the monthly rate of four to eight pounds considered safe by major health organizations. Such extreme dieting can lead to dangerous electrolyte imbalances, dehydration \u2014 and irregular menstruation. \u201cRapid weight loss achieved by crash diets or excessive exercise is detrimental to reproductive outcomes during fertility treatments,\u201d British researchers concluded in a 2010 issue of the Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the second day, I couldn\u2019t even formulate a sentence,\u201d Robben says. \u201cAll I could think about was a piece of chicken breast in my fridge.\u201d By the end of the month, she had lost 20 pounds. The next round of I.V.F. failed as well. (Her doctor declined to comment for this article.) Robben later conceived her twins after seeing a different doctor, and without losing additional weight.\n\nMeyer, of Carolina Conceptions, objects to the idea that weight stigma, not health concern, motivates clinics to require weight loss. \u201cThere are tears in these conversations,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cBut most of the time, I feel pretty good after sitting down with these patients. I think we almost overcompensate so we\u2019re not judged as being biased toward weight.\u201d When Meyer\u2019s clinic turns away a patient based on B.M.I., it offers a referral to a local weight-loss program. He estimates that around 60 percent of those women follow through. \u201cThe patients who then come back to us \\[for treatment\\] are very thankful that they\u2019ve made those changes,\u201d he says. \u201cOr their husband will say, \u2018Thank you for talking to her about that.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\nMeyer admits that he doesn\u2019t know what happens to the patients who don\u2019t return. But those are the patients whom Rachel Ashby, at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, worries about most. \u201cThere probably is a subset of women out there who stop seeking treatment because they are aware that they may feel marginalized in the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d she says. \u201cThey feel this sense of \u2018I can\u2019t pursue this anymore,\u2019 and just live quietly with infertility.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\nBalzano didn\u2019t want to live quietly anymore. After the appointment, she says, \u201cI reconciled myself to having weight-loss surgery pretty much that moment.\u201d Bariatric surgery patients can lose 25 to 35 percent of their original weight, and keep it off longer than dieters do \u2014 making it the most enduring form of weight loss available. But many patients develop vitamin deficiencies because of their limited diets. And female patients are told it\u2019s not safe to become pregnant for at least one year. The operation would cause Balzano to lose yet more time.\n\nTo Balzano\u2019s doctors, this decision was a rational attempt to take control of her health and fertility. The couple see it as her required sacrifice. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t achieve this goal because people didn\u2019t like the way she looked,\u201d says Nick, who was anxious about the surgery\u2019s risks. Balzano recalls: \u201cI was at the point where I would cut off a limb to have a baby. So fine, why not my stomach?\u201d Balzano had her operation in December 2015. When we talked a year later, she told me how she had survived the first months consuming only liquids, and then, tiny portions of fat-free refried beans. Her B.M.I. was down to 32.1. Balzano got Ashby\u2019s name from her bariatric surgeon and made an appointment for January 2017.\n\nBalzano was now 37. However many high-quality eggs she\u2019d had when she began trying to conceive at 30, there were thousands fewer now. \u201cWe have to get started,\u201d Ashby told Balzano. \u201cIn fact, I would have begun treatment when you were at your highest weight.\u201d Nick\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cSo we spent a ton of money and a ton of pain and we could have done this five years ago?\u201d he asked. When we spoke the next day, Balzano was trying to remain calm about the revelation. \u201cLook, it\u2019s done; I\u2019m in a good place,\u201d she said of her surgery. \u201cBut I can understand why someone in my position might be incandescent with rage right now.\u201d\n\nAshby told me that she would have treated Balzano at 340 pounds because she was in good health then.

I would go a month, maybe two, maybe four and my cycles would be like clockwork... THENNN, things would get crazy. I could, and still can, go up to 8-9 months without even thinking about needing to grab some tampons. You get the idea, plus anything else you can imagine in between.   I have no children, and never been pregnant (That I know of (Very possible at some point I had one, if not more, early losses and didn\u2019t even realize it))... Until last September. Last September I found out I was 9 1/2 weeks pregnant with my first daughter. Unfortunately, in January this year, at 21 1/2 weeks, I had to have an emergency medical evacuation due to domestic violence that caused bleeding that my body couldn\u2019t compensate for fast enough; It came down to either me or possibly my daughter (Chances were greater she wouldn\u2019t make it at that gestational age) and to be quite honest, I almost told them to let things happen naturally and see if she can have a lovely life, regardless the physical pain I was under. I did, obviously, end up having them do the deed.   Mind you, I never made the best decisions as a teenager and was always the black sheep and \u201cproblem child\u201d for my lucky mother, LOL! More often than not as a teenager, I had unprotected sex. I lucked out and never fell pregnant. When i turned 21 in 2014, I met the guy I\u2019ve been with since then pretty much (I say \u2018pretty much\u2019, because we have had our fair share of issues). That makes almost 6 years together... I can count on one hand how many times TOTAL we have ever used any type of protection or took any preventative measures. Naturally, a biologically \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201chealthy\u201d female 21-26 years old should have fell pregnant and had AT LEAST one, if not more, successful pregnancies during that time.   My partner had a child that was born a few months before I met him, and during our one and only \u201cmajor\u201d breakup/fights, we split up. If you cannot tell where I\u2019m going with this already, the rebound ended up getting pregnant immediately. This doesn\u2019t make him look that great, but that\u2019s an entirely different story for a different subreddit; Don\u2019t even go there, sis! It\u2019s a LIFETIME movie, LOL! So, five months later, she up and leaves him and moves to another state and that was the end of that. We ended up reconnecting and when I heard about that, it truly broke me. Not for any jealousy reason of him being with someone else, but I was so distraught because I just kept wondering to myself, \u201cSo, you can get someone pregnant... She got pregnant right away and barely knew you. I loved you and have a lot of history with you and I haven\u2019t ever gotten pregnant\u201d, we were not trying... It was the principle of the matter. Why did the other two women he got pregnant deserve it but not me? Does the universe know I\u2019m not good enough to be a mother? Am I broken?   Rewind just a tad, in 2011 right before my 18th birthday, I inquired with my PCP about this and she send me to my usual OB for an ultrasound to check for PCOS and based on the ultrasound, they said I did not have PCOS and I was \u201cstill a teenager, so give it a few years and let my hormones settle down\u201d. I always know SOMETHING was off somewhere, for the most part.   When I found out about my first daughter, I only discovered it due to a phantom twin at 9 1/2 weeks. I had heavy bleeding suddenly with thick, rubbery tissue I had NEVER seen before. When I went to the ER, they asked if I could be pregnant and instantly I said, \u201cNo\u201d... They had me pee in a cup and then told me they were taking me to have an ultrasound done when they came back after 10-15 minutes. Completed the ultrasound and then took me to a separate room and a doctor came in soon after and told me the pregnancy test via urine was \u2018very\u2019 positive and then handed me the ultrasound photos and described what I was looking at. I was miscarrying one of the twins, and he told me per size of the one that looked okay, I was roughly 9 1/2 weeks. Which meant that after my period June 2018, I ovulated! Probably had MANY pregnancy symptoms that were obvious but I thought it wouldn\u2019t ever happen to me so I didn\u2019t even notice them. After that, the rest of that pregnancy was smooth and healthy and would of ended in a very healthy baby being born May of this year if I didn\u2019t have the domestic violence occurrence that I mentioned before. I was clearly heartbroken, however the very next cycle I fell pregnant AGAIN. I\u2019m currently pregnant with another little girl and due November 2019. \n\nDuring my visits with my OB, naturally it came up about my prior irregularity and I inquired as to why that was. Was I a late bloomer? Was my body stuck and after the first pregnancy, it \u2018fixed\u2019 me? No, the response I got now, at 26 years old, was PCOS. I informed them of the prior doctor visit when I was 17 years old that showed I didn\u2019t have PCOS. They took another look and my ovaries are fine, as far as they see. However, I have most other symptoms of PCOS (Irregular cycles, I get random hairs occasionally on my chin, mild acne, and discoloration between my inner thighs). I asked why it took almost 5 years before I (Knowingly) fell pregnant last year, and then immediately was able to get pregnant again (With also wasn\u2019t planned at all and a complete SHOCK) immediately afterwards. The answer I was given was that after the medical evacuation and D&amp;amp;E to make sure that everything was cleared out for health purposes, I was 100% clean, clear, and good to go. In other words, they used the \u201cYou\u2019re most fertile after a loss\u201d reasoning. I asked about the future and what if I wanted to get pregnant again later on (I am concerned about me getting older and running out of time, even though that\u2019s silly at my age currently). \n\nThey said that, obviously, I can get pregnant, and I can get pregnant naturally. They said after some women get pregnant with PCOS, they have no issues getting pregnant afterwards, and others it\u2019s difficult and time-consuming (In terms of getting pregnant naturally). They stated that since they are going to go ahead and clinically diagnose and list that I have PCOS, whenever I am ready after my daughter is born to call them if I don\u2019t want to try naturally for a while and see what happens. They went into how it all comes down to timing, and because I have periods of irregular cycles, and experience unpredictable periods of anovulation, they would prescribe me Letrozole to force my body to manually (I call it \u2018synthetic\u2019, to make it sound cooler (LOL, I like to keep a sense of humor to cheer myself up)) cause ovulation and have a forced fertile period. \n\nAnyone know about cost of Letrozole (With/without insurance), success stories/rates, or just have any overall opinions? My OB is seeming very confident that this will work in my situation based on overall medical history and symptoms. He stated that he didn\u2019t feel I would need any medical \u201cassistance\u201d further than Letrozole, and that was is \u201c90% confident\u201d that if I do decide to pursue this route (Whether it takes too long naturally and I want to hurry things along, or if I just choose Letrozole immediately and skip trying naturally) later on down the road, if I take the Letrozole as directed it will help me fall pregnant within the first 4 cycles of treatment, if not sooner than that. He said that with a very high confidence level, but sounded sincere and not cocky. My OB has always been very humble and professional, so I\u2019ve never had any reason to question him or have doubts about anything that he says to me (I\u2019ve went to the same OB office my entire life and have seen all the OBs there many times, and I\u2019ve never had a preference as they all are just as great as the rest). This just seemed far fetched and like he was reaching this time, though when I thought about it a few days later after Googling Letrozole. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just paranoid I\u2019ll have issues regardless if I have treatment or not, or if I am paranoid that I\u2019ll end up completely infertile after I give birth in a few months. Sorry for the rant, I doubt anyone reads all this, but I feel a tad better writing it all out and posting it for some reason! Regardless what happens to this post or if anyone replies at all, it helped me in some way. \n\n***TL;DR - I am 26 years old. I finally got diagnosed with PCOS. Prior pregnancy that was healthy until 21 1/2 weeks when domestic violence caused a medical evacuation to be performed. Immediately fell pregnant the very next month, and I am currently pregnant and due November 2019. Almost 6 years of regular, unprotected sex but never (Knowingly) fell pregnant (Same partner during that time and he has fathered two babies with precious partners). My OB says Letrozole will be the only treatment I need if I don\u2019t want to try naturally in the future. My OB also said that he is \u201c90% confident\u201d that Letrozole will cause me to fall pregnant within the first 4 cycles of treatment, if not sooner, as long I as conduct the treatment as I am directed by my OB. Anyone know anything about pricing of Letrozole (With/without insurance)? Anyone have any success stories/rates they\u2019d like to share about their experience with Letrozole? Anyone have any overall opinions about Letrozole they\u2019d like to share?***", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13386, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone have anything to say about Letrozole?

We went to see specialist at we had to travel to get there and she was texting us both without even knowing what we found out our asking anything.

Every month I am telling myself that this might be the month only to have my hopes completely and utterly destroyed. Yesterday I was at my breaking point. I am working at a company of around 100 employees. In my department there was never a moment when there wasn\u2019t someone pregnant. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my colleagues dearly. They are awesome but having those pregnancy bellies in front of your face 5 days a week and being the only childless one in an all female department is sometimes just too much. Within the last few month 7 employees got pregnant. While I am happy for them I can\u2019t help but think that that could have been me. Alas, I had a failed pregnancy at 6 weeks. I can\u2019t help but think that I could have been one of them... My doctor told me right after she diagnosed the failed pregnancy that I will never come nearer to a pregnancy as that. I am 39 and we have been trying on and off for the last 10 years. Yesterday another period started and I got the news that an old acquaintance of mine from back home just had a baby ( she\u2019s my age) and another colleague at my job is pregnant). I don\u2019t know how I made it through that day. I called the fertility clinic and have an appointment for next week. We had one failed IUI. I want to try one last time before I call it quits.

It took me many years to seek out help for this as I was so worried and didn\u2019t know what to do or where to go.\n\nDecided a few weeks ago we\u2019d pay to see a private specialist. We underwent all the tests and stuff and they found out my boyfriend has a low sperm count and I\u2019ve got blocked tubes. Our only option was IVF.\n\nThey made us fill out a form that was relating to the protection of any future children that may come of an IVF cycle. It was asking things about whether we had offences towards children or any criminal records. We don\u2019t. \n\nIt asked in one section if we had any mental health issues. I answered and said no. Because I don\u2019t anymore. \n\nHowever what I didn\u2019t realise was that the doctor knew I had previously been taking an anti depressant because it was noted in some medical files I took to the consultation. I have not been on this medication for over a year. He took photocopies of this note even though I\u2019ve not taken the medication in about 14-15 months. He began asking me if I was under the care of my family doctor for my mental issues and I said I hadn\u2019t been for a while because I\u2019m fine. He said that the anti depressant wouldn\u2019t stop us getting treatment and I should go on it again if I feel the need to. \n\nToday we got a letter from the clinic saying they won\u2019t be offering us treatment because we had failed the welfare of the child check due to my previous mental health issues and the fact I said I was suicidal 16 months ago or more.\n\nThats it. We are at the end now. No clinic in the UK is going to offer us IVF because they all follow the same protocols for welfare of children. I don\u2019t even think an overseas clinic would offer it as I\u2019m sure they\u2019re bound by the same rules. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what advice anyone can give me.
