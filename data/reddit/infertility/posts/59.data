My husband and i had been trying to get pregnant for a few months, with no luck. I had already been diagnosed &amp; treated for endometriosis in the past, and i assumed i had PCOS due to several cysts bursting over the past 2 years as well as an absence of my period. I was given a blood test &amp; they confirmed i had PCOS. \n\nWe started Fertility Treatments on March 28th. I spoke with my boss and i let him know i may need additional time off for the appointments as well as a few days off due to possible adverse medication side effects. He said that was OK, i would just need to submit a time off request whenever i needed to go in. I made several copies of the time off request form and submitted them as soon as possible before an appointment. \n\nIn April we went through our first round of Femara. I ended up going to the doctor a lot more than i had anticipated. During this time, i apologized to my bosses and asked if it was still OK. They said i had to do what i had to do, and to continue turning in time off forms. They were all approved. The first round ended up being a failure. \n\nOn May 1st i was diagnosed with Flu Strain B. I'm assuming i contracted it through visiting the doctor many times. I was given a doctor's note &amp; faxed it into the office that allowed me to come back in to work on the 4th. They told me to stay home. On May 11th my employment was terminated. They said it was due to \"Poor Performance\". I was never given any verbal or written warnings that my performance was lacking. There was never any indication that my absences were causing an issue, or causing my job performance to suffer. Even though i knew they must be. I tried to work harder and longer hours to make up for time missed. \n\nMy question is- How do you deal with Infertility and Working? I have an interview for a new job on Wednesday and i'm wondering IF i should bring it up and when? I understand how this may pose a problem- becoming pregnant right after starting a job and then having to leave to start a family. But in all honesty, i just want to get my insulin resistance and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome side effects under control. (I.e excessive hair growth, hormonal acne, ovarian cysts). Obviously starting a family is the end goal. I am meeting with my RE tomorrow morning to discuss the possibility of after hour visits or the least amount of visits as possible. We are doing one more round of Femara, this time with an HSG test and my husband had a semen analysis and i had a blood panel done.

Baby shower season is here (what the fuck even is \"Baby Shower Season\") and if you're like me you are RSVP-ing no to invitations left and right.  \n\nOur standard advice around here is to skip the shower and send a nice gift but holy shit there's nothing like scrolling through some fertile asshole's registry to *completely* ruin your weekend.  \n\nI've picked up a few tricks to make this as painless as possible, so here's my guide to buying a shower gift without crying yourself to sleep (hopefully):\n\n\n *1. Set a budget. You're going to need to be a little flexible here, but decide on a target amount to spend. You'll be paying for gift wrap and possibly shipping, so set your budget $10-$15 lower than the top end of this window.\n\n*2. Find out where they're registered. If you're given the choice between, say, Babies R Us and Target go with Target. We're trying to get this done while seeing as few pictures of happy baby bullshit as possible. If you're really lucky, they might even be registered with Amazon. \n\n*3. Wait for a day when you're feeling strong and ready to knock out your to-do list. If you're already in tears, today is not that date.  \n\n*4. Begin humming the Mission Impossible theme song (I am not joking) and navigate yourself to their registry. **You want to get in and get out as quickly as possible, so pretend you're being timed.**\n\n*5. Click Sort by: Price Low to High.\n\n*6. Looking only at the price column, scroll down until you hit the first line item that's roughly the budget you set. Click \"Add to Cart.\" If it's nipple butter, she's getting nipple butter. Whatever. She registered for it so you know she wanted it. And you don't have to be there to watch her open it, so who gives a flying fuck? \n\n*7. Resist the temptation to look at anything else on the registry. The last thing you need is for a baby rubber duckie inflatable bath chair to send you over the edge (been there, done that).\n\n*8. Proceed to checkout, pay for the gift wrap, and have it delivered directly to their home. Here's sample text for the card: \"Congratulations, I am so thrilled for you guys! With love, PlumLion\" Don't overthink it, and when you find the wording that feels right, save that shit to your computer because you're going to copy/paste/done for all future baby gifts until you're at a place where you're less tender around this. \n\n *9. Go do something else that requires your full concentration so you don't start ruminating.  Alternately, get blind drunk.  We don't judge here.

He is pretty nervous and doesn't really know anyone that's been through infertility or feel comfortable discussing with anyone outside of internet strangers  so he has no idea what to expect.  So far we've only gotten the appointment date with no instructions.  We'll be driving two hours and taking off work for the appointment, as there are no male fertility doctors (or fertility specialists of any kind) anywhere near us, so we want to get this right!  Anyone been to urologist and mind giving me an idea of what kinds of tests they may run or just what to expect in general?\n\nBackground:\n\nWe've been trying 2+ years with zero success.  Both 29yo.  All of my tests have come back normal so far, although I've only seen my ob/gyn there are no REs anywhere near.  I've had hormone testing, saline ultrasound, and HSG all coming out normal.  He has had two SAs performed by my ob/gyn office.  Both ~14 million.  I don't know if that's total or per ml.  My Dr has had me on metformin for the last year or so.  We have done three rounds with just Clomid (me taking the Clomid) and timed intercourse.  We've done one round of IUI and in that sample the tech told me there were around 5 million sperm and they were all normal morph &amp; motility.   He takes fertilaid and a vit c + zinc supp and we are actively working on losing weight.  He also takes several medications for high blood pressure which is part of the motivation for losing weight.  He works at a plastic factory and I have a strong suspicion this is really harming his fertility.  I am hoping beyond hope we can someone get his counts up because I'm not sure how we could swing any extended treatments with our work schedule since the nearest clinics are two hours away.  \n\nI'm really glad this sub exists. I don't have a huge support system because my husband prefers to keep the MFI diagnosis private but even just lurking so far has helped me so much.

And oh did I mention that my friend who had a miscarriage in January told me on Tuesday she's twelve weeks pregnant again? And she just loved me so much and didn't want to lose me?

He is incompetent as fuck and since November I have sent over 75 emails to supervisors documenting his shitty work. He finally got a final warning last week and the very next day i got pulled into big boss's office for a sit down. Apparently he claimed I was talking about him to other people in our office, but I refuted that and thought we moved on. So after waking up in a pool of blood to discover my IUI failed again yesterday morning, I went to work and I got pulled into HR with big boss and a supervisor. He came back with more lies including that I have made several racially charged statements to him (he's Brazilian) and  he told them I refer to my pregnant coworker as \"the pregnant bitch\" and that I make homophobic statements about my supervisor who is gay. \nI'm dumbfounded. I may be barren but I certainly don't hate pregnant women, and I've never once in my life uttered or thought that phrase. I'm not racist and I'm not a homophobe, I'm probably the most progressive person I know. They are interviewing everyone on my team to verify the veracity of these allegations, but at the end of the day it's his word against mine and I don't see how we can continue to sit next to each other every day, I don't think there's any coming back from a racist allegation. My company is extremely diverse and inclusive and the HR lady even asked me why I would want to work in such a diverse place if these are the views I hold.\nI packed my desk and left work early on sick time and called in today. He's 21 he can get a new job and be fine, but he's fucking with my life and my family. I'm going to lose my insurance and infertility coverage. I'm freaking the fuck out. I've never had a write up or been in trouble in the year and a half I've worked there. I come in early, stay late, work the overtime and holidays, I help with every department and I train new hires on specific programs we use. It seems to only be obvious to me that he is on a sinking ship and he's trying to take me down with him. I've worked so hard to get to this job and to get this insurance, we tried on our own for 4.5 years before we were able to have the ability to see the RE. Its like i had the shot to have the family i always dreamed of and now I feel like it's all going to get ripped away from me. I've been crying since I left work yesterday.

We're undergoing treatment for unexplained \"but you're old and that's probably why\" infertility, Clomid 100mg/LH shot + IUI. First cycle was negative result, second cycle went totally sideways. Had 2 prime follicles of the same size at time of IUI, warned of possibility of twins. Beta last week was negative, period never showed up and I am regular as clockwork - or /was/ - but my uterus has been acting like I'm in constant ovulation for the last week. Called clinic last week to say something was wrong, felt very dismissed, was told the beta was negative, to wait and period would probably show up in a few days. Called this week, they ran a progesterone on the sample from last week, it was very low and I was told I hadn't ovulated. Went in today for a diagnostic ultrasound, where they found a corpus luteum that has just started to collapse, and a developing follicle. Endometrium at 4mm. So either one of the follicles from the IUI ultrasound ovulated very late, or I somehow grew another follicle to maturity in a week, but when I asked how any of this could happen, they shrugged. The problem was definitely not \"oh you just didn't ovulate\". I was told not to expect a period this month and we could just \"try it ourselves\" this month and if I regulate after it, we'll go back to the IUI schedule. I asked whether I needed to have any hormone therapy to regulate - due to the low progesterone at the beta - and was told no. \n\nThe doctor keeps insisting this is diminished ovarian reserve at play, and is pushing IVF very hard, and wants to do donor eggs. I am 43, so I realize that my age is a big issue. I'm not tied to my genome and eventually if we have to go IVF, that's my preferred method. My issue is that after researching diminished ovarian reserve, I can find nothing that indicates that multiple ovulation or short cycles are a thing. This was also just our second cycle, my insurance covers up to six, and I'd like to exhaust those before going on to IVF - which we would have to pay out of pocket. \n\nI'm just.. I'm very annoyed that multiple calls to the clinic with \"Hey my period is still missing and I feel like I've been ovulating for a week.\" were met with complete dismissal, I had to push them to do a diagnostic ultrasound, we found weirdness that the doctor either can't or wouldn't explain, yet was still harping on diminishing ovarian reserve. Am I wrong to feel that if my ovaries were really in as diminished as I keep getting told they MUST BE due to my age, that they wouldn't be pitching so many follicles? \n\nIt's been a super emotional day today, my apologies if I sound unhinged. \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8536, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Feel like the repro doc isn't listening.

I am assuming my body is fine because I have normal, regular periods and ovulation has been tracked. He has finally started considering adoption, but I also found out that IVF is covered by my health insurance (I live in Ohio, and quite honestly I'm shocked). So, there's no reason for us not to try that.\n\nIVF freaks me out. I feel very guilty because I feel like this is ultimately MY choice whether to adopt or try IVF. But my heart has been with adoption long before I met my husband, and I truly feel like this is a calling for me. \n\nI'd love advice on how to discuss all of this with my parents, especially my mother who is bi-polar and has narcissistic tendencies. I am very worried that they are going to convince me to do IVF because any time I brought up adoption in the past she told me I was crazy to \"adopt some messed up kid.\" I am honestly terrified to tell them, but I feel very alone in all of this and a part of me wants their blessing.\n\nWould love any advice and honestly I would just love someone to tell me I'm not selfish for not wanting to do IVF.

I read the top post and the one about supporting a spouse through IF, but I wanted some more opinions/things to say to help my friend.  We're both 27 and have been friends for about 15 years; I care about her very deeply.  I got a long series of texts from her this morning because she was having an especially hard time, basically stating that she wanted me to be her \"dump person\" who she can vent and rant to since I've been supportive in the past and have stuck by her, even when she's being consumed by her IF struggle, as well as listen to and validate her feelings/thoughts.\n\nShe's been going through fertility treatments and actively trying to conceive for about six years, with a break for the past year due to success with treatment.  Last month was her first back on the treatments, and she is spotting already. She described it as her personally \"failing again\".  I think another reason she wants me to be there for her during all this is that she said most people say to her \"Well at least you have one\" and then dismiss it, and I have never and would never say that to her.  I responded that her sadness over this is entirely separate from her previous success, which took five years.  She's had four or five miscarriages, one after she had announced at 16 weeks, and one other at about 14, the others were around 12 or 13.\n\nMy friend has extra stress about her infertility from her job; she works at a womens' center dealing with pregnancy.  She loves what she does, and is fulfilled by her job, but when she's trying to get pregnant it's very hard emotionally to see women who had no trouble getting pregnant, are aborting, or simply have many children already.  Today she told me that she was entering info on patients into the system and thinking that if she was pregnant with them, such-and-such would be her due date.\n\nI'm a little out of my depth with actually being comforting rather than offering empty platitudes.  I know a therapist would be better suited, and she sees one, but she wants to talk to a friend who knows her well too.  Please, what can I say? How can I approach this? I know a lot of things NOT to say (\"Well just be happy with what you have\" and \"Everything happens for a reason\"), but I would very much appreciate any and all advice for me to help my friend. Her husband is not much support emotionally, and my friend said that she's lost other friends by talking about her IF issues. What can I say?

At that point, we got a second opinion from a DOR expert at another clinic - who said that she wouldn't necessarily diagnose DOR until she saw how I responded to stims. We ultimately decided to go ahead with IVF at our original clinic, but switched to a second RE there (whom we absolutely loved for his bedside manner).\n\nFast-forward through our complete failure of an IVF cycle that definitively confirmed my DOR diagnosis, and we have decided to pull the trigger and switch to the DOR expert (clinic #2, RE #3).\n\nWe had a consult with her yesterday that gave us back a very very tiny bit of hope. \n\nIn reviewing the records from our failed cycle, and RE #2's suggestion that we next try metformin (despite my GI disorder, and the fact that I don't have PCOS) along with microdose lupron, she said, \"it's not exactly medical malpractice... but I think that's a terrible idea.\" Instead, she suggested the following:\n\n1. Stick with DHEA, CoQ10, and an estrogen-primed antagonist protocol (which she considers to be more aggressive than microdose lupron) -  but lower the stim dose. She thinks I over-stimmed on my last cycle, and essentially wasted money (and possibly hurt egg quality).\n\n2. Add clomid and letrozole, to stimulate my ovaries in multiple ways all at once (this sounds fun \ud83d\ude33). She said that this is a protocol developed by a researcher at NYU particularly for women with stats similar to mine, and that both clinics have seen good results with it. \n\n3. She said I would be a prime candidate for HGH, given my okayish AFC and decent response to stims, but terrible egg quality. (This was her strongest recommendation, but is something my first clinic wouldn't even consider when I asked about it!)\n\n4. Use a dual trigger to help the smaller follicles to mature.\n\n5. She agreed with my decision to switch from folic acid to methylfolate on account of my compound heterozygous MTHFR mutation (which I discovered myself through 23andMe and Genetic Genie, and which my first two REs admitted they know nothing about). \n\n6. She also agreed with my decision to start vitamin E. It's recommended by *It Starts with an Egg* for egg quality, but is also a blood thinner - so makes sense for me, given the MTHFR mutation and the fact that I can't take baby aspirin on account of my IBD.\n\n7. We're going to do the Episona Sperm Test on my husband. Even though his counts look good, we're worried there could be a problem on his end because his only two uncles are infertile (but are too private to be willing to share details). We want to be absolutely certain that there's nothing wrong with his sperm DNA before we spend any more time, energy, and money on my eggs.\n\nAll of that is the good news - basically, we feel that switching doctors, protocols, and labs means that we're trying absolutely everything we can. We're hoping that we get better results, but even if we don't, it will hopefully give us the sense of closure we'll need in order to move forward with Plan B.\n\nThe bad news is that the new clinic's lab shuts down for cleaning for the entire month of June, so we'll have to wait two cycles instead of one before we can get started. My husband is really sad about another month of waiting, and I'm kind of bummed about the prospect of being bloated and chained to a fertility clinic during prime vacation/beach season. However, I'm trying to look on the bright side - this gives us a bit of extra time for my new supplements to hopefully do something, and I can enjoy my body being back to normal for 6 weeks before starting stims again (today I am *7 pounds lighter* than I was 16 days ago!).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8564, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update - We're switching clinics!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8km2i4/update_were_switching_clinics/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "aphitx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1526748659, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8kmghp/what_would_you_docoverage_yet_transfer/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8kmghp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/8kmghp/what_would_you_docoverage_yet_transfer/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1526748661, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 4, "selftext": "Hi all.  I was hoping I could find out if anyone has any advice that I\u2019ve not thought of.... (even better if you have Aetna).\n\nBackstory\nDid my first IVF round last fall (I was 39.  All good labs and sperm except I have DOR/ low AMH) that I paid for entirely out of pocket (while husband is a full time law school student).  I did mini stim. Had 3 eggs -2 embryos fertilized.  We transferred 2 at day 3 and one took.  I had an early MC due to poor egg quality with 3 diff chromosomal abnormalities.  I was laid off about 2 months later right before Christmas (second layoff for me in 2017).  2017 was stellar.  I got a new job in March \u201818 with IF coverage.  My coverage is unlimited as my company is in Massachusetts (having paid for the first cycle myself I am SO grateful).  Since I\u2019m 40, Aetna just needs day 3 FSH under 19.  Mine was under 10 last week.  So... just waiting on my prior auth right now.\n \nIssue/ Question\nI learned yesterday from Aetna that if I end up with 5 or more day 3 embryos OR 3 or more day 5 embryos, I MUST do a transfer in order to do another IVF round.  I know I didn\u2019t even get 5 day 3 embryos before (on mini stim), but since I have coverage, we\u2019re doubling Gonal-F to 300 iu a day, 150 Menopur and adding in microdose Lupron 2x a day in hopes of better numbers (and quality).\n\nOriginally, I was hoping to do a few retrievals, PGS test (paying out of my own pocket) and then transfer only if I get normals, to avoid another heartbreaking miscarriage.  I\u2019d even be willing to share PGS results with Aetna... in the end, it would cost them even more with all the D&amp;C\u2019s than letting me transfer normal embryos (I know normals aren\u2019t a guarantee).\n\nNow.... with this new news... I'm not sure how to proceed.  No idea if this has to be a fresh transfer...\n\nHas anyone had luck appealing this requirement? given my history of miscarriage... it's only been one... plus my age... I\u2019m sure I have WAY more abnormals than normals at this point.  \n\nWhy would anyone transfer an abnormal embryo if they didn\u2019t have to?  \n\nJust when I thought I was close to trying again.... grateful for the coverage but really don\u2019t understand the rationale...\n\nSorry for the novel.  And thanks for any feedback, advice, whatever.  I am so grateful for this group (and for the coverage... just gotta figure out my next step).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 8565, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What Would You Do...Coverage Yet Transfer Requirements and DOR?
