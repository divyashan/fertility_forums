I like him a lot--he is personable, happy to answer questions, and has mostly very positive reviews.  So far, we have done lots of blood tests, an SHG, and an endometrial biopsy.  The first two didn't show anything of note, but the endometrial biopsy showed that the endometrium was out of phase with my menstrual cycle, which means I have a luteal phase defect.  This makes sense to me, because with both of my miscarriages my progesterone was low.  The RE prescribed femara for me to start next cycle, and I came away from the conversation feeling relieved to have a diagnosis and a plan.\n\nHowever, when I began to research, I found many sites that said the endometrial biopsy is an outdated an ineffective way to diagnose luteal phase defect.  This is making me nervous that:\na) Maybe the diagnosis is incorrect and\nb) Maybe I should not trust my RE if he is performing outdated procedures.\n\nI was wondering if you all could share your experiences with endometrial biopsies.  Are they still commonly performed?  If you had one and were diagnosed with luteal phase defect, were you prescribed femara?  If so, what has your experience with femara been like?

Twenty-one spontaneous pregnancies (16 births, five miscarriages) occurred in 15 (4.4%) patients. Multivariate analysis (Cox model) showed that a familial history of POF, secondary amenorrhea, presence of follicles at ultrasound, and inhibin B and estradiol levels were significantly predictive of resumption of ovarian function (P &lt; 0.01), whereas association with an autoimmune disease, anti-Mullerian hormone level, the presence of follicles on biopsy, and/or genetic abnormalities did not appear predictive. We created a predictive score for resumption of ovarian function comprising age at diagnosis, presence of follicles at ultrasound, and inhibin B level.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIntermittent ovarian activity in patients with POF is not a rare phenomenon. The predictive score described in this study may help us to identify POF patients most likely to recover intermittent ovarian function.\n\nPremature ovarian failure (POF) is a disorder associated with female infertility, and it affects approximately 1% of women under the age of 40 yr (1). POF encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of conditions and is ascribable to two major mechanisms: follicle dysfunction and follicle depletion (2). Although causes such as autoimmunity, monosomy X, and environmental factors play a role in POF, the etiology in most cases remains unknown (3, 4).\n\nPOF does not constitute early menopause because ovarian \u201cfailure\u201d in this syndrome is not permanent in all women. Indeed, some women with premature ovarian insufficiency are known to experience intermittent and unpredictable ovarian function (5\u20139), with ovulation in 11 to 46% of POF patients undergoing weekly measurement of estradiol and progesterone as well as ultrasound during a 2- to 6-month follow-up period (6, 8, 10).\n\nMoreover, approximately 3 to 10% may conceive spontaneously and unexpectedly after diagnosis. We have previously demonstrated by histological examination of ovarian biopsy in these women that some of them (28%) exhibit the presence of growing follicles (9).\n\nTo date, no clinical, laboratory, and/or morphological features are recognized as predictive of intermittent ovarian function (11). Recently, we described the largest cohort of POF patients to date (n = 357) (9). In this cohort, some patients experienced spontaneous pregnancies and/or almost complete normalization of their FSH levels and/or resumption of their spontaneous menstrual cycles, i.e. three events that reflect ovarian activity.\n\nWe now report on initial clinical, endocrine, and ultrasound screening of POF patients who experienced resumption of ovarian function and/or pregnancies to identify predictive factors for these events. In addition, we developed a predictive model using multivariate analysis to predict the likelihood of resumption of ovarian function on the basis of initial screening results in POF patients.\n\nPatients and Methods\n\nPatients\n\nA total of 369 patients with idiopathic POF were referred to our center from 1997 to 2010; they were studied retrospectively before 2001 and prospectively thereafter. Spontaneous POF was defined by at least 4 months of amenorrhea, two FSH readings above 30 mIU/ml at least 1 month apart, and a karyotype excluding Turner's syndrome and gonadal dysgenesis. None of the patients had a history of chemotherapy and/or pelvic radiotherapy. The study was approved by the boards of the various institutions involved, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. A total of 347 of these 396 patients were described previously (9). Clinical, ultrasound, endocrine evaluations, and genotyping were performed, as well as ovarian biopsy in patients consenting to the latter procedure were assessed as described previously (9). Briefly, clinical screening included: age at diagnosis; clinical presentation; familial history of POF defined as early menopause (\u226440 yr of age) in a first-degree relative; personal history of autoimmunity; hormonal evaluation, including determination of FSH, LH, estradiol, inhibin B (from 1997), and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (from 2003); and systematic screening for thyroid and ovarian autoimmunity, and after 2000, adrenal autoimmunity. Pelvic ultrasound screening included the presence or absence of follicles, with maximum length and area (square centimeters) by ovary, where available. Genetic screening included karyotype determination and DNA extraction for FMR1 gene and FSH receptor gene.\n\nIntermittent ovarian activity was defined as spontaneous pregnancy and/or resumption of menstrual cycles (at least two consecutive episodes of uterine bleeding within 3 to 6 wk) without any hormone therapy and/or an FSH level below 13 IU/liter (upper normal range) after diagnosis without hormone replacement therapy.\n\nInformation on resumption of ovarian function was available for 358 of the 396 patients. Data concerning resumption of menstruation, decrease in FSH level, spontaneous fertility, and hormone therapy were collected as follows: 150 patients continued to be followed up regularly by our department or were contacted by mail or phone between January and September 2010. For the remaining 208 patients, the same data were collected, but from their clinical files and before 2010.\n\nHormone measurements\n\nBlood was collected and plasma was immediately separated by centrifugation for 15 min at \u22124 C and stored at \u221220 C pending assay. Plasma LH and FSH were measured by immunofluorometric assay (Cis-Bio, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 1.5 and 5.2% for LH and 2.6 and 4% for FSH, respectively. The detection limit was 0.15 IU/liter for both assays. Estradiol was determined after plasma extraction (DiaSorin, Antony, France; Schering CisBio International, Gif Sur Yvette, France). Plasma inhibin B was measured using a commercial ELISA (Serotec, Kidlington, Oxford, UK) with a detection limit of 10 pg/ml and intra- and interassay coefficients of variation of 6 and 15%, respectively. Inhibin B level was considered to be 5 pg/ml when the level was below 10 pg/ml. Serum AMH (AMH/MIS Elisa; Immunotech Beckman-Coulter, Marseille, France) concentrations in serum samples were measured in duplicate using a sandwich ELISA method. The assay range was 0.4\u201321 ng/ml. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation for AMH determination were 5.3 and 8.7%, respectively. The sensitivity of the AMH assay was 0.05 ng/ml. In women with normal menstrual cycles, the normal range for d 3\u20135 of the cycle is 2.2\u20136.8 ng/ml. Testosterone concentrations were determined by RIA (Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland). The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were between 3.8 and 7.5%, and between 4.8 and 7%, respectively. The sensitivity of the testosterone assay was 0.029 ng/ml (range of measurement, 0.14 to 14.4 ng/ml). Androstenedione was determined by RIA (Immunotech Beckman-Coulter). The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 8.1% or less and 11.9% or less, respectively. Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was measured by conventional RIA (Immunotech Beckman-Coulter). The intraassay coefficient ranged from 2.6 to 8.1%, and the interassay coefficient ranged from 3.7 to 11.9%. The normal range was based on results obtained from healthy women during a normal menstrual cycle and provided by our hormonal investigation laboratory.\n\nAutoimmunity screening\n\nAntiadrenal antibodies were tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France); since 2004, anti-21-hydroxylase antibodies were tested by RIA (CisBio, Bagnols-sur-C\u00e8ze, France). Antiovarian antibodies were tested using an indirect immunofluorescence method (Bio-Rad, binding site). Antithyroid (anti-thyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin) antibodies were tested using passive hemagglutination assays and, more recently, RIA.\n\nOvarian ultrasound\n\nPelvic ultrasound was performed using a Siemens Sonoline Elegra ultrasound system and a 6.5-MHz probe. Where available, ovarian area was calculated as follows: S = L (length) \u00d7 W (width) \u00d7 0.8. The normal ovarian area is between 2 and 6 cm2.\n\nMorphological analysis of ovarian biopsies from POF patients\n\nFor each patient undergoing laparoscopic ovarian biopsy after informed consent, a biopsy sample measuring 3\u20135 mm was obtained from each ovary and fixed in neutral formalin. After embedding in paraffin, the biopsies were serially sectioned at 5 \u03bcm and stained with hematoxylin-eosin-safran. One section out of every 20 was examined, and numbers of resting and growing follicles were counted.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe descriptive statistical analysis used numbers (percentages) for qualitative variables and means \u00b1 sd for quantitative variables. Because patients have their own individual follow-up times, the most suitable methodological framework for such data is survival analysis. Using this approach, variations in follow-up time are taken into account by considering as the study criterion the time elapsed until the event of interest, in this case POF fluctuation, for patients with observed fluctuation and the follow-up time for patients without any observed event at the end of follow-up. Patients with no observed POF fluctuation during follow-up are termed \u201ccensored\u201d at the time of follow-up. They are included in survival models only because they are considered \u201cat risk\u201d for the event during the follow-up period. Thus, the study criterion is in fact the time between POF diagnosis and fluctuation. To begin with, univariate analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for resumption of ovarian function. This analysis consisted of Kaplan-Meier estimation of survival functions and cumulative incidence functions taken as one minus survival functions. Potential predictive factors were determined using log-rank tests for qualitative variables and univariate Cox models for quantitative variables. Several multivariate Cox models were then analyzed: first, three submodels were constructed, one for each data source (i.e. clinical, ultrasound and hormonal data), after which the best submodels were pooled to construct the final model. The factors used in the final regression model were chosen according to univariate analysis, P values, and missing data rates. Each model or submodel definition was determined by step-wise Cox regression using factors having a P value by Wald test of less than 0.05. The final Cox result was used as a prognostic score to construct a five-class predictive algorithm. All tests were two-sided with a significance level of P = 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS 9.2 software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\n\nResults\n\nPatient characteristics\n\nAt baseline, the mean age at diagnosis for these 358 POF patients was 26.6 \u00b1 7.9 yr. Most of our patients (n = 281; 78.5%) were presenting secondary amenorrhea, and only 77 (21.5%) were presenting primary amenorrhea and partial or normal pubertal development. As anticipated, mean FSH and LH levels were high (77.0 \u00b1 40.6 and 31.8 \u00b1 18.7 IU/liter). Inhibin B values were available for 290 patients, and 67 women (18%) had detectable levels. Serum AMH was available for 180 patients, and 39 women (21.7%) had detectable levels. Pelvic ultrasound was performed in 325 patients; images suggesting the presence of follicles with a diameter of at least 2 mm were observed in 50% of patients. The median ovarian area in 233 patients was 2 \u00b1 1.5 cm2.\n\nMean follow-up was 58.8 \u00b1 57 months (1 to 423) for the 358 patients included, with 286 patients (79.9%) being followed for at least 1 yr, 233 (65.4%) for at least 2 yr, 197 (55.3%) for at least 3 yr, and 167 (46.6%) for at least 4 yr. Clinical, hormonal, and ultrasound evaluations were performed at 26.73 \u00b1 45.26 months (0\u2013360) after POF diagnosis. A total of 209 patients (58.7%) were evaluated within 1 yr of diagnosis of POF.\n\nDuring follow-up, 86 (24%) POF patients experienced intermittent ovarian function. The mean follow-up period was 45.96 \u00b1 39.47 months (1 to 145.71) for the 86 patients with resumption of ovarian function and 62.66 \u00b1 63.28 (1 to 423) for the 272 without resumption (P = not significant). The mean time from POF diagnosis to evaluation was 18.23 \u00b1 22.35 (0\u2013120) months and 29.41 \u00b1 50.11 (0\u2013360) months, respectively, for patients with and without intermittent ovarian function (P = not significant). The mean age of these 86 patients at the time of the diagnosis was 29.6 \u00b1 7.0 yr. Mean FSH at evaluation was 81.9 \u00b1 56.8 IU/liter. Thirty-eight percent of these 86 POF patients had detectable inhibin B values, and 27% had detectable AMH levels. The median ovarian area of fluctuating POF patients was 2.8 \u00b1 1.95 cm2.\n\nPOF patients with resumption of ovarian function\n\nOf the 86 patients presenting intermittent ovarian function, 78 experienced resumption of menstrual cycles, 45 presented a decrease in FSH level above the normal range, and spontaneous pregnancy occurred in 15. As expected, resumption of menstrual cycles generally constituted the first discernable sign of intermittent ovarian function (79%). Fifty percent of patients experienced one sign of intermittent ovarian function, 39.5% experienced two signs, and 10.5% experienced three signs. Seventy-six (88%) patients experienced intermittent ovarian function during the first year after diagnosis, and only three after 4 yr.\n\nThe cumulative incidence of POF patients with resumption of ovarian function was 25 \u00b1 2% (se) at 48 months and 22.5 \u00b1 2% (se) at 12 months (Fig. 1). The cumulative incidence of pregnancy at 48 months was 4.3 \u00b1 3%.\n\nFig. 1\n\nEstimated cumulative incidence of POF patients with intermittent ovarian function up to 48 months after diagnosis.\nEstimated cumulative incidence of POF patients with intermittent ovarian function up to 48 months after diagnosis.\n\nTwenty-one pregnancies occurred in 15 women. The outcomes of these pregnancies were 16 live births, one twin birth, four miscarriages, and one elective abortion. The first pregnancy occurred at 16 \u00b1 20 months [from 1 up to 69 months after POF diagnosis (range)] after diagnosis of POF. Before the first pregnancy, nine of these 15 patients (60%) presented other signs of intermittent ovarian function: three had FSH below 15 IU/liter, and six had resumption of menstrual cycles. Seven pregnancies (35% of all pregnancies and 50% of completed pregnancies or live births) occurred without any hormone therapy. During pregnancy, two patients had diabetes mellitus, and one had hypothyroidism. Twelve of 13 singleton births occurred at term, and 10 children were breastfed. Two pregnant patients had previously been diagnosed as carriers of an FMR1 premutation.\n\nUnivariate analysis\n\nAll results of univariate analysis are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1\n\nUnivariate analysis of clinical and hormonal parameters in POF women predictive for resumption of ovarian function\n\nVariable \tUnivariate analysis dataa \tP value \nClinical variables \t \t \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Age at diagnosis (n = 358) \t1.040 [1.011\u20131.070] \t0.0058 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Familial history of POF: yes vs. no (n = 358) \t38.46 \u00b1 0.066 vs. 22.52 \u00b1 0.026% \t0.01 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Autoimmunity history: yes vs. no (n = 358) \t32.17 \u00b1 0.056 vs. 22.99 \u00b1 0.027% \t0.10 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Secondary amenorrhea: yes vs. no (n = 358) \t31.25 \u00b1 0.029 vs. 2 \u00b1 0.022% \t&lt;0.0001 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Puberty: yes vs. no (n = 358) \t28.32 \u00b1 0.027 vs. 6.9 \u00b1 0.040% \t0.0005 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Body mass index (n = 329) \t1.006 [0.964\u20131.050] \t0.7952 \nHormonal variables \t \t \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003FSH at hospital (mIU/ml) (n = 353) \t0.982 [0.975\u20130.988] \t&lt;0.0001 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Estradiol (pg/ml) (n = 351) \t1.003 [1.001\u20131.004] \t0.0002 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003LH (mIU/ml) (n = 350) \t0.987 [0.974\u20131.000] \t0.0428 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Testosterone (ng/ml) (n = 319) \t1.360 [0.412\u20134.494] \t0.6139 \n\u03944-Androstenedione (ng/ml) (n = 312) \t1.372 [1.025\u20131.835] \t0.0334 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003DHEA (ng/ml) (n = 265) \t1.017 [1.001\u20131.033] \t0.0340 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003TSH (mIU/liter) (n = 330) \t1.024 [0.896\u20131.170] \t0.7272 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003IGF-I (ng/ml) (n = 218) \t0.997 [0.994\u20130.999] \t0.0178 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003FSH (IU/liter) at diagnosis (n = 265) \t \t0.0028 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200330 \u2264 FSH &lt;52 vs. 52 \u2264 FSH &lt;79 vs. FSH \u226579 \t49.14 \u00b1 0.069 vs. 22.97 \u00b1 0.052 vs 29.2 \u00b1 0.014% \t \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Inhibin B (pg/ml) \t \t&lt;0.0001 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Undetectable vs. \u226415 vs. &gt;15 (n = 290) \t21.38 \u00b1 0.029 vs. 22.46 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 53.39 \u00b1 0.78% \t \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003AMH (ng/ml) \t \t \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Detectable vs. undetectable (n = 180) \t31.75 \u00b1 0.076 vs. 30.04 \u00b1 0.043% \t0.36 \nUltrasound variables \t \t \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Mean ovarian area &lt;2 cm2vs. \u22652 cm2 (n = 233) \t14.18 \u00b1 0.033 vs. 47.56 \u00b1 0.054% \t&lt;0.0001 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Follicles: yes vs. no (n = 325) \t40.89 \u00b1 0.043 vs. 13.98 \u00b1 0.030% \t&lt;0.0001 \na\n\nFor continuous variables, hazard ratio [95% CI]; for qualitative variables, POF with resumption of ovarian function, estimated cumulative incidence at 48 months \u00b1 se.\n\nThe clinical predictive factors for resumption of ovarian function used in the univariate analysis were: age, secondary amenorrhea, normal puberty (P &lt; 0.01), and familial history of POF (P = 0.01), but not personal autoimmune history (Table 1). The cumulative incidence of POF patients with resumption of ovarian function at 48 months was 9.56 \u00b1 3% in patients with POF diagnosed before the age of 20 yr vs. 30.86 \u00b1 3% in patients with POF diagnosed after the age of 20 yr (Fig. 2A). Only two patients with primary amenorrhea experienced resumption of ovarian function. These two patients had clinical and biological hyperandrogenism with an elevated testosterone level for POF patients (0.41 and 0.5 ng/ml); AMH was 4.64 ng/ml in one patient and undetectable in the other. Body mass index was 30 and 16.6 kg/m2. Finally, primordial follicles were detected in ovarian biopsies for these two patients.\n\nFig. 2\n\nCumulative incidence of POF patients with intermittent ovarian function by age (A), FSH level (B), inhibin B level (C), and ovarian area (D).\nCumulative incidence of POF patients with intermittent ovarian function by age (A), FSH level (B), inhibin B level (C), and ovarian area (D).\n\nThe predictive laboratory factors were: FSH level at diagnosis and initial evaluation (Fig. 2B); estradiol and inhibin B levels (Fig. 2C) (P &lt; 0.01); LH, androstenedione, and DHEA (P &lt; 0.05) levels; but not AMH or testosterone levels. For FSH at diagnosis of between 30 and 52 IU/liter, the cumulative incidence of POF patients with resumption of ovarian function at 48 months was 49.1 \u00b1 7 vs. 22.97 \u00b1 5% for FSH of between 52 and 79 IU/liter. On pelvic ultrasound, the predictive morphological factors were both the presence of follicle structures and ovarian area (Fig. 2D) (P &lt; 0.01). Neither the presence of follicles in ovarian biopsies (n = 111) nor karyotype abnormalities were predictive factors for resumption of ovarian function (data not shown).\n\nMultivariable analysis and prognostic score\n\nIn the multivariate analysis, the final model constructed using 249 patients included the following parameters: familial history of POF, secondary amenorrhea, follicles observed at ultrasound, and inhibin B and estradiol levels (Table 2). The choice of these parameters used in the final model was based on the results of univariate analyses and missing data rates. These parameters were independently predictive factors for resumption of ovarian activity in POF patients. Using this model, we created a predictive score for resumption of ovarian function in POF patients: score = 0.67225 \u00d7 POF familial history + 1.80204 \u00d7 secondary amenorrhea + 1.16392 \u00d7 follicles at ultrasound + 0.00594 \u00d7 inhibin B (pg/ml) + 0.00795 \u00d7 estradiol (pg/ml). We calculated the score for each patient, divided the cohort into five classes, and established the cumulative incidence of POF patients with resumption of ovarian function for each class (Fig. 3). The cumulative incidence of POF patients with resumption of ovarian function at 48 months by class was as follows: class 1 (score &lt;0.23; n = 25), nil; class 2 (0.23 \u2264 score &lt;2.63; n = 89), 14.48 \u00b1 4%; class 3 (2.63 \u2264 score &lt;3.25; n = 70), 30.21 \u00b1 6%; class 4 (3.25 \u2264 score &lt;3.87; n = 41), 46.75 \u00b1 9%; and class 5 (score \u22653.87; n = 24), 83.3 \u00b1 7%.\n\nFig. 3\n\nCumulative incidence of POF patients with intermittent ovarian function in each class by score determined by Cox model.\nCumulative incidence of POF patients with intermittent ovarian function in each class by score determined by Cox model.\n\nTable 2\n\nMultivariate analysis of factors predictive for resumption of ovarian function in POF patients\n\nVariable \tHazard ratio [95% CI] \tP \nFamilial history of POF (0/1) \t1.959 [1.132\u20133.389] \t0.0163 \nSecondary amenorrhea (0/1) \t6.062 [1.469\u201325.013] \t0.0127 \nFollicles at ultrasound (0/1) \t3.202 [1.772\u20135.788] \t0.0001 \nInhibin B (pg/ml) \t1.006 [1.001\u20131.011] \t0.0111 \nEstradiol (pg/ml) \t1.008 [1.004\u20131.012] \t&lt;0.0001 \nDiscussion\n\nNumerous case reports and certain observational and interventional studies have reported spontaneous pregnancies and ovulation in POF patients. However, these studies did not have homogeneous inclusion criteria, and most included only a small number of patients. In a cohort of 358 POF women\u2014the largest cohort described to date with extensive clinical, laboratory, ultrasound, and genetic data\u2014we report on the predictive factors for resumption of ovarian function in POF women, and we propose a predictive score for resumption of this function.\n\nThe cumulative incidence of POF patients with resumption of ovarian function was 22.5% at 12 months and 25% at 48 months; these results are consistent with the literature. Observational and interventional studies based on 30 to 50 subjects, with monitoring by both pelvic ultrasound and serum hormone levels, described spontaneous ovulatory cycles in 17 to 50% of POF women (8, 10\u201319). It should be pointed out that our calculated incidence may have been underestimated for two reasons: on the one hand, a number of patients were on continuous HRT, and thus resumption of ovarian activity could not be detected in these women; on the other hand, because our study was retrospective, underestimates may have occurred for such fluctuating cases.\n\nAmong clinical predictive factors, primary or secondary amenorrhea appears to be a critical factor [hazard ratio, 6.062 (95% confidence interval, 1.469 to 25.013)]. Only two patients with primary amenorrhea showed resumption of ovarian activity, and both had clinical hyperandrogenism. We assume that the mechanisms responsible for POF in patients with primary amenorrhea are different, are probably more severe than those responsible for POF in patients with secondary amenorrhea, and do not permit spontaneous resumption of ovarian activity. More surprisingly, a familial history of POF was a good predictive factor for resumption of ovarian activity. However, it is also possible that the etiologies responsible for familial forms of POF are more likely to be responsible for resumption of ovarian function. Some studies suggest significant resumption of ovarian activity in patients with an FMR1 premutation (20), as we observed in two patients with an FMR1 premutation who spontaneously became pregnant. Finally, in our study, a history of autoimmunity is not associated with resumption of ovarian activity, probably because of the small number of cases of autoimmune POF in our cohort or because of the underestimation of this diagnosis due to the lack of a reliable diagnostic test. Indeed, diagnosis of autoimmune mechanisms in POF is difficult and remains controversial; screening for antiovarian antibodies relies on indirect immunofluorescence and seems to have low specificity. Adrenal autoimmunity is rare but is the best known form of autoimmunity associated with POF (21). Although thyroid autoimmune diseases were frequent in our cohort, they do not appear significantly more frequent than among the general population (22).\n\nIn our study, FSH, estradiol, and inhibin B levels appear predictive of resumption of ovarian activity. For example, an FSH level of between 30 and 50 IU/liter at diagnosis suggests a better prognosis than higher levels. This is consistent with several studies showing a reduction of FSH levels in POF patients having ovulatory cycles or follicular growth (8, 23). However, these FSH levels remained higher than the normal FSH levels. Similarly, among premenopausal patients with ovulatory cycles, variability in FSH levels above the normal range has been described (24). FSH levels are dependent on underlying follicular activity and are closely related to inhibin B secretion (25), and it thus seems natural that low FSH levels in POF patients should be associated with resumption of ovarian activity. Inhibin B produced by granulosa cells has been described as a marker for growth of the small antral follicle cohort. As the size of the follicle pool declines, inhibin B levels fall and FSH levels rise, with the latter reflecting loss of inhibin restraint. Finally, it is well known that estradiol levels reflect ovarian activity. Indeed, in POF patients with spontaneous ovulation, higher estradiol levels have been described than in normal ovulatory patients. The predictive character of FSH, estradiol, and inhibin B levels at POF diagnosis for resumption of ovarian activity within 4 yr is most likely related to the fact that these levels reflect ovarian capacity to maintain partial activity.\n\nSurprisingly, in our study AMH levels are not predictive of resumption of ovarian activity. We can propose several hypotheses. The high rate of missing data (50%), due to relatively recent demonstration of the role of AMH as a more accurate indicator of the presence of ovarian follicles (26), may explain the lack of power of this study. A study of a wider population might possibly result in this factor being considered as predictive. Nevertheless, there is still some discussion concerning the exact role of AMH. It represents a good marker for ovarian reserve and is well correlated with antral follicle counts and ovarian response to hyperstimulation in in vitro fertilization (IVF) (27\u201329). In the perimenopausal stage, AMH is the first biological marker to decline very early, much earlier for example than increased FSH (25, 30). An association between the number of follicular structures (at biopsy) and AMH levels was noted in the POF women in our study (31, 32). AMH appears to be an excellent quantitative marker of ovarian reserve with no intracycle variation, including in POF patients. However, AMH is probably not a good marker of qualitative ovarian reserve. In some studies, AMH is not correlated with embryo quality and pregnancy rates (33), and in a recent study, Gleicher et al. (34) found that in patients aged above 42 yr, normal FSH levels were predictive of good ovarian response in IVF despite low AMH levels. In POF patients with low ovarian reserve and very low or undetectable AMH levels, it could be that a lower rate of FSH reflects follicular estradiol and inhibin B production and suggests superior follicle quality.\n\nAndrogen production in POF patients shows a decrease in androgen synthesis, particularly of testosterone and androstenedione, but not of DHEA, compared with age-matched fertile controls (35). In our study, higher levels of androgens (DHEA and \u03944-androstenedione) appear predictive of resumption of ovarian activity. Sporadic production of ovarian steroids at almost normal levels secondary to occasional maturation of follicles up to the antral stage has been described in some POF patients (6). Moreover, observations in situ suggest that the ovaries of POF patients with elevated androgens may be capable of advanced follicular development (36). An adrenal contribution to androgen production, with increased expression of adrenal LH receptor, has been described or suggested in POF patients with chronically elevated gonadotropins (36). This capacity to produce higher levels of DHEA may contribute to resumption of ovarian activity. This seems consistent with a study reporting the occurrence of pregnancies in POF patients after supplementation with DHEA (37) and several studies in patients responding poorly to IVF and describing improved results by DHEA supplementation (38).\n\nAll ultrasound characteristics of ovaries appear to be predictive for resumption of ovarian activity. In patients with normal regular cycles, ovarian volume, ovarian area, and antral follicle count are correlated with the physiological age of menopause and the number of primordial follicles (14, 24).\n\nThe cumulative incidence of pregnancies in our cohort (4.8%) is consistent with data from observational studies in POF patients (16). Unfortunately, due to the low number of pregnancies in our POF patients, we were not able to establish a predictive model of pregnancy. The mismatch between the pregnancy rate and the rate of follicular growth may be to the result of such qualitative impairment of the antral follicles in POF patients. Studies of ovarian biopsies of POF patients show that the antral follicles of these patients were not healthy; histological analysis revealed atretic changes or premature luteinization antral follicles in POF subjects (32). Interestingly, pregnancy occurred frequently in patients without estrogen replacement therapy.\n\nIn conclusion, spontaneous resumption of ovarian function is not a rare phenomenon in POF patients. Our studies led to the identification of predictive factors for such resumption. This study may thus help to select POF patients with the greatest likelihood of intermittent ovarian function. To validate the predictive model and the prognostic score developed in this paper, further studies are necessary in large cohorts of POF patients.

We analyzed different factors associated with a poor prognosis for a cumulative IVF LBR in women with rAFS stage III and IV endometriosis. A total of 101 patients were included, representing 232 IVF-ICSI cycles and 212 embryo transfers. The primary endpoint was the cumulative LBR per cycle and per patient.\n\nResults\n\nThe cumulative LBR per cycle was 14.7% (n = 34) and that per patient was 31.7% (n = 32). The cumulative LBR was significantly decreased by active smoking [adjOR = 3.4, 95% CI (1.12\u201310.60), p = 0.031], poor ovarian response (POR) according to the Bologna criteria [adjOR = 11.5, 95% CI (1.37\u201396.83), p = 0.024], and rAFS stage IV [adjOR = 3.2, 95% CI (1.13\u20138.95), p = 0.024]. The cumulative LBR per women was 59.4% without factors associated with a poor prognosis and 25.6% in the case of one factor, and it decreased to 7.7% in the case of two or three factors (p &lt; 0.001).\n\nConclusion\n\nActive smoking, POR according to the Bologna criteria, and rAFS stage IV endometriosis had a negative impact on the IVF-ICSI cumulative LBR for women with rAFS stage III and IV endometriosis. Because smoking dramatically decreases the LBR with endometriosis, stopping smoking before IVF-ICSI should be strongly advised.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Friday Topic: Endo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6dhw0j/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1495823762, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6dit5w/friday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6dit5w", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 153, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6dit5w/friday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1497182920, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

I was put on Nuvaring after that, and had regular cycles while on the nuvaring for 1.5 years. After that I had a few cycles that eventually led to no periods again. I went to my Well women's exam at 20 and starting discussing this with my OBGYN. She ran labs and ruled out any genetic disorders and such. All she told to me was \"Your hormones are extremely out of whack.\" In December of last year, She put me on a 10 day supply of Provera that made me bleed like a slasher film with hopes it would jump start my cycles but surprise, nothing. I mention to her my desire for pregnancy so she prescribed me 2 months of birth control then clomid. So I guess my question here is, how do my chances look in response to the Clomid? The second question is - Should I get another OBGYN? She hasn't given me any diagnosis to my absent periods or lack of ovulation. Then she causally throws in the statement \"oh with PCOS it's tricky...\" when I ask any question related to my course of treatment and is now blaming my weight for my lack of periods. (I am 148 at 5foot even.) but I have been dealing with this since the beginning of puberty at 13 when I was 110 and 4\"11. \n\n\nI feel so left in the dark. \nMe and my husband want nothing but a family of our own.

I apologize for my tardiness in replying but I just haven't been feeling up to looking back at this. I should mention that on my last visit (the same visit) I mentioned to my OBGYN that I was TTC for the past year and she responded with \"We need to either get you bleeding or get you pregnant.\" and then she offered me two choices. 1 - provera with clomid. 2 - 2 months of BC with clomid following with my option being the latter. She then gave me another line saying that i have \"Premature ovarian failure.\" \n\nI feel she's so caught up with INDUCING a period but not with regulating any of my hormones. She wanted to prescribe me provera for the rest of my life so I would have a period but I couldn't help but think to myself \"Whats the point of making me bleed if the hormones are wrong?\" I am supposed to see her again on the 6th to actually get prescribed the Clomid but after hearing all of you guys advice and talking with my SO, I will instead ask her to refer me to a RE.

Preovulatory uterine flushing could reduce intrauterine debris and inflammatory factors preventing pregnancy and constitute an alternative to IVF. Our objective is to assess the efficacy of preovulatory uterine flushing with physiological saline for the treatment of unexplained infertility.\n\nMethods and analysis \n\nWe will perform a randomised controlled trial based on consecutive women aged between 18 and 37\u2005years consulting for unexplained infertility for at least 1\u2005year. On the day of their luteinising hormone surge, 192 participants will be randomised in two equal groups to either receive 20\u2005mL of physiological saline by an intrauterine catheter or 10\u2005mL of saline intravaginally. We will assess relative risk of live birth (primary outcome), as well as pregnancy (secondary outcome) over one cycle of treatment. We will report the side effects, complications and acceptability of the intervention.\n\nEthics and dissemination \n\nThis project was approved by the Ethics committee of the Centre Hospitatlier Universitaire de Quebec (no 2015\u20131146). Uterine flushing is usually well tolerated by women and would constitute a simple, affordable and minimally invasive treatment for unexplained infertility. We plan to communicate the results of the review by presenting research abstracts at conferences and by publishing the results in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nTrial registration number NCT02539290; Pre-results.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Saturday Topic: Unexplained IF", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6dobpo/journal_club_saturday_topic_unexplained_if/"}, {"author": "greenjasminetea", "author_created_utc": 1494022950, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "27 | endo | IUI#2", "author_fullname": "t2_2lv8di", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1495901601, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6dohur/severe_lightheadedness_on_estrace_advice/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6dohur", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6dohur/severe_lightheadedness_on_estrace_advice/", "retrieved_on": 1497185737, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi lovely people!

For those of you who may not be familiar, I had my first FET cycle cancelled in April and am currently in the process of attempt #2. \n\nMy clinic asserts that the following conditions must be met for a FET to move forward:\n\n*  &gt;8mm lining\n* &gt;250 estrogen \n* endometrial growth period can only last 21 days or else the quality of lining starts going down, so they cancel if your lining isn't thick enough then. \n\n**1st FET (cancelled)**: 2 weeks of oral Estrace only my lining was 5.9 mm and E2 was 429 (\"perfect\"). They added another week of vaginal Estrace after that, my lining was 7mm and E2 was 1400. At this point, the 3rd week, they stated my estrogen was getting \"too high\" and approaching egg retrieval levels, which would hurt receptivity. They also said the growth phase had gone on too long to keep delaying the transfer and cancelled it. I should also mention that the lining started becoming more inconsistent and as they stated \"deteriorating\" after a 3rd week. I was beyond frustrated and devastated with the constant delays I have faced, but they seemed confident for another approach.\n\n**Current attempt:** I have been using Vivelle Dots ONLY for lining. After 11 days, it was a nice 9.1 mm this morning. The RE said pending good estrogen levels, I can transfer next week. Left the clinic excited, but I just received a call saying my estrogen was 150, when they want it at 250, and they would like me to add vaginal estrace 1 FULL week before ANOTHER blood draw/lining check. They admitted there is a chance my lining will start collapsing after 1 whole week, since it was already perfect today. So, I'm at risk of having a second fucking FET cycle cancelled. Last time lining too thin, this time estrogen too low. In my eyes, I have 2 options: \n\n1. Add estrace starting today and keep my original transfer date, assuming that it would go up at by least 92 within the next 6 days, since we know it went up by 1000 last time we did this (which was ~142 a day). My RE did not agree to this. \n\n2. Come in 3-4 days from now to recheck estrogen levels, which would give me a good chance of having the estrogen be high enough while having a lower risk of my lining just falling apart, and am waiting on a response. \n\nMy concerns: \n\n* If my transfer is 6/9, my husband will be out of town. A minor annoyance.  \n*  If my transfer is cancelled again, I have to wait another 6 weeks for a THIRD ATTEMPT.\n* Honestly, I feel like this could have been prevented by adding in 1 daily estrace pill to my protocol. With pills only, my estrogen was good/lining thin, now with patches only my estrogen is low/lining good. \n* I am kind of chained to my clinic since I paid for the transfer already with my initial IVF cycle (fresh transfer was cancelled too). My 3 blasts are in their freezer. \n* Why am I such a medical mystery to them? \n* Does it really seem like I need to wait another week, or is this a sign they are batching patients? I feel like it's a huge risk that my lining will start deteriorating after a full week and I'll be cancelled again, needlessly. \n* Has anyone had to extend their cycle for estrogen being too low, and the lining stayed good?\n\n\n \nIf I'm cancelled again, I'm going to demand a WTF meeting.  I'm open to any ideas or suggestions.

Casper, Yaakov Bentov\nObjective\n\nTo investigate whether temporarily withholding FSH and adding androgen could improve follicular response during a microdose flare protocol in women with slow follicular growth or asynchronous follicular development.\n\nDesign\n\nObservational pilot study.\n\nSetting\n\nUniversity-affiliated private fertility center.\n\nPatient(s)\n\nTwenty-six women aged 34\u201347 years with poor response to stimulation or a previous cancelled IVF cycle and with slow or asynchronous follicular growth during a microdose flare cycle.\n\nIntervention(s)\n\nFor 13 women, after initiation of ovarian stimulation using the microdose flare protocol, gonadotropin administration was interrupted and transdermal testosterone gel was added for several days (4.4 \u00b1 1.2 d) starting after cycle day 7 (mean cycle day 10 \u00b1 2.6).\n\nMain Outcome Measure(s)\n\nFSH, E2, follicular growth, and total number of mature oocytes retrieved were determined for all of the patients. Cycle cancellation rate as well as pregnancy rate following embryo transfer were also documented when applicable.\n\nResult(s)\n\nFSH levels declined (25.2 \u00b1 6.5 to 6.8 \u00b1 3.2 IU/L), E2 levels increased (896 \u00b1 687 to 2,163 \u00b1 1,667 pmol/L), and follicular growth improved significantly during gonadotropin interruption and were tracked for 2 days during this time frame. The average number of oocytes retrieved was 5.3 \u00b1 2.6, and the ratio of mature to total oocytes was 4:5. Four of the 13 women in the interruption group conceived following frozen embryo transfer, whereas none in the control group did.\n\nConclusion(s)\n\nThe androgen\u2013interrupted FSH protocol may improve follicular response to gonadotropins in cycles that might otherwise be cancelled.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Sunday Topic: Protocols", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6dw98r/journal_club_sunday_topic_protocols/"}, {"author": "mynameismemory", "author_created_utc": 1334888170, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "29F+30M|MFI|ICSI May/FET June", "author_fullname": "t2_7i7fp", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496009395, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6dwi8h/just_no_mil/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6dwi8h", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 25, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6dwi8h/just_no_mil/", "retrieved_on": 1497189855, "score": 18, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Just as some background to this story, my husband and I are in the severe MFI group, worked with a urologist for a year+ trying to get us into IUI range, never happened, just did our first round of ICSI and now we are waiting on our FET (initially planned on doing PGS but didn't get enough embryos).\n\nSo anyway. My brother in law is a year younger than me and has some learning disabilities. He had his first serious girlfriend last year, and they started having sex and the in-laws (understandably so) freaked out a bit worrying about him getting her pregnant. She has disabilities as well and couldn't remember to take the pill every day and has a shitty family that wouldn't support her more to try something like an IUD. So, after lots and lots and lots of strife and discussions between my MIL, FIL, and BIL, they came to the agreement that a vasectomy would be best because BIL may never be able to live alone, let alone care for a child.  \n\nEnter present day: We are at the in laws helping them with stuff at their new house. MIL and I are talking and infertility comes up because it always does (we've been open with our families about it). Turns out the urologist that did BIL's vasectomy is a family friend of theirs who specializes in infertility and they offered to talk to us if we ever need it/want a second opinion, which was super sweet of them.  \n\nSo curiosity got the best of me and I asked if she knew if BIL's counts, etc. since they have to do pre and post vasectomy SAs. I've been wanting to know in case it's genetic but thought it was super awkward to ask about, and thought this was as good of a time as any. \n\nHer response was that his counts were extremely high and that it all looked good (which is good but so unfair and made me feel way more sad than I was anticipating). Then she goes on to say they considered offering us his semen to use. And THEN she says that FIL was with him for the actual procedure (because of his special needs) and that FIL said \"He's really well endowed!\" ew ew ew ew and then she responded with \"Wonder where he gets that from!\" EW EW EW. Things I did not want or need to know about! \n\nTLDR: In the span of 15 seconds, MIL said they considered offering us BIL's pre-vasectomy semen, and told me BIL and FIL are well endowed.

(I hope I did the link thing right...) I read all of your comments but didn't have any emotional energy to respond or even be on reddit until today, but wanted you all to know how much they were appreciated. You guys are my rock. Also I got less mad at husband within 3 hours and we talked and it was all fine. Had a really nice date night Thursday and great couch sex =) \n\nMy update is shockingly some good news (background: 7 follicles, 6 eggs, 2 fertilized, poor grade on day 3, very very discouraged)- we got one blastocyst! Both embryos were not good looking at day 3 so we decided to grow out to day 5/6 so that on the off chance we still had something, we could be more confident in its chance to survive the freeze/thaw and maybe even take when transferred. And low and behold one survived and is a 2BB, so we're actually really happy with that! That gives us a total of four frozen embryos, the other three being day 3. Does that mean that our blast will have a better chance of \"taking\" than the day 3 embryos?\n\nRegardless, really happy with that considering I thought we were not going to get anything at all! \n\nHappy Memorial Day weekend to everyone!

The empirical nonhormonal medical treatment has been proposed for patients with idiopathic or noncurable oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and for normozoospermic infertile patients. Anti-inflammatory, fibrinolytic, and antioxidant compounds, oligo elements, and vitamin supplementation may be prescribed. Infection, inflammation, and/or increased oxidative stress often require a specific treatment with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or antioxidants. Combined therapies can contribute to improve sperm quality.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Monday Topic: MFI", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6e0vp6/journal_club_monday_topic_mfi/"}, {"author": "RockyBalboa84", "author_created_utc": 1490391958, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_16gvx8", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496072096, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6e0wo3/bollywood_celebs_and_ivf/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6e0wo3", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 12, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6e0wo3/bollywood_celebs_and_ivf/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "s_mmrNbt0jvHWMdwiT0xvfALcnTdL7SB3qvb6-YqRIw", "resolutions": [{"height": 86, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/PSH16UncIuj65SPkzwIBK37jE_9LX_FOrHnCad2zjDU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=81c1f21661dbf3a58af2b65e7156798b", "width": 108}, {"height": 172, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/PSH16UncIuj65SPkzwIBK37jE_9LX_FOrHnCad2zjDU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=14fbd2e6b9b52a3e0b624cb5d8fd4395", "width": 216}, {"height": 256, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/PSH16UncIuj65SPkzwIBK37jE_9LX_FOrHnCad2zjDU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=3905d78412fe3b62c3c56ad5c82d75f9", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 480, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/PSH16UncIuj65SPkzwIBK37jE_9LX_FOrHnCad2zjDU.jpg?s=5e95439e03c1be117316c54218e1dc7b", "width": 600}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1497192037, "score": 14, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Full disclosure:\n\nI love Bollywood\n\nhttp://m.femina.in/celebs/indian/bollywood-celebs-who-opted-for-ivf-49719-1.html", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bollywood celebs and IVF", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6e0wo3/bollywood_celebs_and_ivf/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496082947, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6e1zua/monday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6e1zua", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 117, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6e1zua/monday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1497192575, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

We've had our fair share of bingos and shitty advice, but we've also received some great support. Part of our reason deciding to do this was because for me, when people would hint about us having kids, say we'd be great parents, flat out ask, etc. it was just easier to say \"Oh we've wanted kids forever, we're having troubles and are working with specialists\" instead of making up something or sucking it up then crying my eyes out later.  \n\nAnyway, now that we're gearing up for a (hopefully!) June transfer, I wish I hadn't been so open. Everyone keeps asking about when we're transferring because they know we have a few frozen embryos, and I want this part to just be for my husband and I. I don't want everyone knowing when the transfer is, and I don't want everyone asking if it worked. If it does, I want to tell people in our own time. If it doesn't, I want to grieve and let people know in our own time. I suck at lying (I've been trying to say we don't know and we'll likely transfer later this summer).  \n\nALSO, I've definitely doubted my religious beliefs more than once (oh, like all the time...and continue to do so) while going through all of this, but I want my mom, grandma, and a few other close family members to know because they've been praying for us this whole time and I really felt their prayers during our egg retrieval and while waiting for our fertilization reports. I feel like all of their prayers have helped so much!  \n\nTLDR: I'm torn between wanting close family to know about our potential upcoming FET for their support, not wanting anyone to know so that we can actually surprise people if it *does* work, and not wanting to tell everyone because I want this part of this process to be just mine and my husband's. I already feel like IF has robbed me from being able to tell my husband we got pregnant in some cutesy way (if this ever works), and I don't want it to rob us from announcing it to our families, too.  \n\nSorry that was so long and rambly. I'm feeling quite anxious and sad today. \n\nEdit: Thank you, thank you, thank you for all your thoughtful answers/replies. I'm reading all of them and really appreciate it.

He wasn't interested in the sitting to my problems or anything and he rushed to the entire appointment.\n\nBut he said when he was looking at my test results that one of the ovarian test or a test was a 1.86 and they usually like to have it at 2.0. But, for the life of me I cannot figure out which test it is.\n\n\nAnd although I told him the high risk pregnancy doctor told me last year that I could not take Clomid due to the higher risk of twins ( I know it's a small percentage but I have cerebral palsy and I would not be able to carry twins) he said not to worry about it and it's no big deal. There's nothing I can do about my diet exercise weight or anything except for take Clomid and hopefully that would work and if not then I have to be transferred to a different hospital to do IUI or IVF treatments.\n\n\nDo you guys have any idea what that test he was talking about maybe? I looked online at my CD3 testing and I don't see one result that comes out as a 1.86. So I'm very confused. Do any of you know what that could be?\n\n\nThank you\n\nPS.

And I've searched the Internet looking for some advice (and maybe a wee bit of a reality check) for some time now but I'm not finding anything so I decided to post for myself . \n\nAnyway, I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome AND endometriosis around four years ago. So I exsperience a lot of pain on a regular basis but because I've always desperately wanted children I've always put up with it. \n\n3 years ago I met my fianc\u00e9. \n\nI went to the doctors for regular check ups and they would always say \"have you thought about having a baby?\" And I always said no not yet. Because I wasn't in the position to. I knew my ovaries were deteriorating, that there was a huge amount of scar tissue on them and there had been a discussion about the possible need to remove my left ovary if it got worse. \n\nBut... at my last doctors appointment they didn't suggest getting pregnant. \n\nAnd it's amazing how a comment I used to get so angry about, hearing it so often, could break my heart when the doctor didn't say it. \n\nMy ovaries are dying. \n\nAnd my god that's a hard sentence to type when I'm 23. It's a possibility I never considered. \n\nBut as I said, I'm engaged, and I've been with my fianc\u00e9 for three years. The doctors has said if I ever want to have children I need to start trying now, that it already might be too late but it's the final count down. My ovaries need to come out, the pain will get worse, they could become infected etc etc. \nAnd I thought that's what we'd do, we had always talked about having kids later on.\nAnd no we're not in the greatest financial position, we don't have the best jobs, we still flat with our friends but...\nWe both want to have kids. \nBut he doesn't want to now. Not yet. \n\nI don't have time to wait. I won't... I can't force him into it. I can't just get pregnant because I want to even tho he's not ready...\nAnd won't be ready for \"5-10years\". I obviously, don't have that kind of time.\n\nBut my heart is breaking. \nYes it may already be too late but...\nHow can we not even try? \nCan we even survive this? \n\nI feel like I'm sacrificing everything I've ever wanted (having kids) for him because he's not ready and I'm angry. Im selfish and I'm so angry. \n\nSo I guess... I'm just looking for advice. \nHow do I deal with the fact this has happened to me?\nHow can I let go of how angry I am?\nAnd how can we move past this? \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Infertility at 23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6eby01/infertility_at_23/"}, {"author": "GozuTashoya", "author_created_utc": 1389406543, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_er7nx", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496197890, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1496207178, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6ec300/cost_comparisons_of_ivf_in_canada_vs_southern/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6ec300", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 18, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6ec300/cost_comparisons_of_ivf_in_canada_vs_southern/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "tNMmcFFfEZy8psWkCWgkU9vWOsKD_YTfiyckij86AL8", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/YtwEjiKBMHg9XqRNH2mGjhpUDsSu_1p2dZTSITkF7DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=d09a359284e5979f445727a8a069ba90", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/YtwEjiKBMHg9XqRNH2mGjhpUDsSu_1p2dZTSITkF7DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=f340b3915df0ac9ae3956b5e1f784df6", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/YtwEjiKBMHg9XqRNH2mGjhpUDsSu_1p2dZTSITkF7DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=b211595585ca297cd8ddb69ba2260d34", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/YtwEjiKBMHg9XqRNH2mGjhpUDsSu_1p2dZTSITkF7DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=7a9e034414d9bce6351eaea70c75fcc3", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/YtwEjiKBMHg9XqRNH2mGjhpUDsSu_1p2dZTSITkF7DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=dbd7533b19c7f97963a32a226594d83a", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/YtwEjiKBMHg9XqRNH2mGjhpUDsSu_1p2dZTSITkF7DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=34e7c12c3611d0540f12766c862450e1", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/YtwEjiKBMHg9XqRNH2mGjhpUDsSu_1p2dZTSITkF7DE.jpg?s=1bc9d22a5864d925dca6de14cbeb76c7", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1497197563, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Here are costs of IVF from a couple clinics Canada (and a couple in L.A.), including airfare (from Los Angeles) and lodging.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LURdLSWGD_qJSSrmB3iawR5ZyTYM_QnNE17WXasFioU/edit?usp=sharing\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cost comparisons of IVF in Canada vs. Southern California", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6ec300/cost_comparisons_of_ivf_in_canada_vs_southern/"}, {"author": "Indigowomenscenter", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496223341, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6edvli/home_remedies_for_polycystic_ovarian_disease_to/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6edvli", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6edvli/home_remedies_for_polycystic_ovarian_disease_to/", "retrieved_on": 1497198446, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Home Remedies for Polycystic Ovarian Disease to overcome Infertility", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6edvli/home_remedies_for_polycystic_ovarian_disease_to/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496225348, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6ee04x/wednesday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6ee04x", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 188, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6ee04x/wednesday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1497198508, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

PGS analysis of blastocysts had been demonstrated to improve implantation rates, but more so as age increases. The use of PGS in donor egg cycles is increasing; this group provides an excellent model to study the effect of DE PGS testing on implantation and delivery rates.\n\nObjective \n\n\nTo evaluate outcome differences between in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients using DE under three conditions: fresh embryo transfers, frozen embryo transfers (FET) without PGS, and FET biopsied for PGS.\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n\nThis retrospective cohort study of fresh IVF and FET cycles examined embryos derived from DE from 3/2011 to 12/2015 at an academic medical center. FET cycles undergoing PGS were sub-grouped according to their analysis method: microarray-based genomic hybridization (aCGH) or next-generation sequencing (NGS). All transfers were single embryo and evaluated for primary outcomes: implantation rate (IR), clinical pregnancy rate (CPR, the presence of a visualized fetal heartbeat), ongoing pregnancy rate/live birth rate per transfer (OPR/LBR) and spontaneous abortion rate (SAbR, miscarriages per viable pregnancy). Data were analyzed using Chi square, student\u2019s t-test and Fisher\u2019s exact t-test.\n\nResults\n\nThere were 366 donor egg transfers: 107 fresh no PGS, 146 FET no PGS and 113 FET with PGS, of which 83 used aCGH and 32 NGS. There were no statistically significant differences in IR, CPR, and LBR between study groups. Separate Chi square analysis of SAbR showed no significant differences in PGS versus no PGS and fresh versus frozen (FET with and without PGS) groups although there was a trend towards lower SAbR in the PGS group. Sub-analysis of the PGS group noted a trend towards higher OPR/LBR in patients who used NGS, but this was not statistically significant.\n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n\n\nIn patients using donor eggs, PGS was not associated with improved pregnancy outcomes compared to non-PGS cycles. \n\nOne explanation is that oocytes from younger women have a lower incidence of karyotype abnormalities. There was also no significant difference in miscarriage rate among the three groups in sub-analysis, although more data may elucidate if the trend toward lower miscarriages in the PGS group is significant. However, it is important to highlight that each group represents a viable option to pursue at the patient\u2019s discretion, as the choice whether or not to biopsy embryos was not associated with detrimental outcomes. Overall, these results suggest that the benefits of performing PGS testing on embryos derived from donor eggs may be limited and should be framed within the parameters of labor (on the lab side) and costs (on the patient\u2019s side). Further use of PGS in clinical practice will increase the sample size to further solidify its significance on outcome overall.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Wednesday Topic: DE", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6eg00h/journal_club_wednesday_topic_de/"}, {"author": "RockyBalboa84", "author_created_utc": 1490391958, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_16gvx8", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496247903, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6eg2d6/re_recommendations_in_nyc/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6eg2d6", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 20, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6eg2d6/re_recommendations_in_nyc/", "retrieved_on": 1497199525, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm tired of crying over my stats and ready to move forward.\n\nAny recommendations?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "RE recommendations in NYC?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6eg2d6/re_recommendations_in_nyc/"}, {"author": "shadow728", "author_created_utc": 1486780406, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_15a6sk", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496249370, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6eg87h/strategies_for_frequent_blood_draws/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6eg87h", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 21, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6eg87h/strategies_for_frequent_blood_draws/", "retrieved_on": 1497199605, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm heading into my first IVF cycle and not excited about getting stuck every other day / every day.

My husband and I have been TTC for 16 months. We know at least part of the problem is my husband has very low motility and low testosterone. In Feb of this month I had my testosterone checked at my OBGYN with a blood test, my Testosterone, total was 30ng/dL and my free was 2.9 pg/mL. Obviously those are both great numbers. We were in the very beginning of the TEST EVERYTHING phase. I have hashimoto's thyroid disease so we knew my numbers might be wonky anyways, but they were great. \n\nFlash forward \n1) I am seeing a compound pharmacist who test my testosterone with a saliva test (on day 20 of my cycle) and I have gone up to 62 pg/mL. This number is still in the normal range but I am over weight (192lbs &amp; 5' tall) and the compound pharmacist really thinks I have PCOS.\n\n2) My husband is on clomid and his numbers have greatly improved.

But the price of the fertility treatment is steep, financially and emotionally. Failure can be especially devastating, and a round of IVF can cost upward of $20,000. Unsuccessful patients are often motivated to try again. And again. The only federal law that explicitly addresses IVF requires the government to publish fertility clinic success rates. But this antiquated measurement system, coupled with scant oversight, obscure the differences between the best doctors in the business and those who run troubled clinics and push a risky practice. \n\n\n**TIMINGS**\n\n\n\u2022 Pacific Standard Time: Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 1:00:00 p.m\n\n\n\u2022 Eastern Standard Time: Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 4:00:00 p.m\n\n\n\u2022 British Summer Time: Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:00:00 p.m\n\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION If you want to know anything about this event, message the mod team.

The initial examination included the measurements of waist circumference and hip circumference, body mass index, and waist/hip ratio. A total of 171 women were divided into three groups according to ovarian reserve patterns: (i) adequate ovarian reserve pattern (AOR, n=77), (ii) high ovarian reserve pattern (polycystic ovarian syndrome, n=62), and (iii) diminished ovarian reserve pattern (DOR, n=32). The serum estradiol (E2), follicle stimulating hormone, total testosterone, 17-hydroxy-progesterone (17(OH) P), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, anti-mullerian hormone, and hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH) D) levels were analyzed.\n\nResults: \n\n\nNo significant difference between three different groups was detected in terms of body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist/hip ratio, E2 and 17OHP levels (p&gt;0.05, for all). One-hundred-sixty-nine (98.2%) women in all groups had vitamin D concentration below 30 ng/mL as a cut-off value. The circulating 25 (OH) D levels did not show a significant difference between all ovarian reserve groups (p=0.804). No correlation between 25(OH) D and anti-mullerian hormone levels was documented in women with AOR, polycystic ovarian syndrome and DOR patterns (r=-0.099 p=0.393, r=0.034 p=0.794 and r=0.157 p=0.390 respectively). 25 (OH) D levels were significantly correlated with body mass index, waist circumference and hip circumference parameters only in AOR group (r=-0.355 p=0.002, r=-0.305 p=0.007 and r=-0.322 p=0.004 respectively).\n\nConclusions: \n\nThere is no association between 25 (OH) D and ovarian reserve markers. 25 (OH) D levels were significantly correlated with body mass index, waist circumference and hip circumference parameters only in AOR group.\n\nKeywords\nVitamin D, 25 (OH) D, Ovarian reserve, Anti-mullerian hormon\n\n\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.21613/GORM.2016.676\t\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Gynecology Obstetrics &amp; Reproductive Medicine \n\nCreative Commons License\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Thursday Topic: POF, DOR", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6ekxlr/journal_club_thursday_topic_pof_dor/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496308125, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6elkdi/june_waiting_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6elkdi", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 55, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6elkdi/june_waiting_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1500092363, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Welcome to the monthly waiting thread.

I had three retrievals and a bunch of cancelled cycles last year, did all manner of estrogen priming, lupron demi-halt (I think that's the same as micro-flare), other lupron priming protocols, mini IVF with just femara. No matter what we did or how many follicles were retrieved and fertilized, they would pretty much all die before day 3. My record was I think 5 retrieved, most fertilized nicely with PICSI and looked great, and then only one made it to day 3.\n\nOn all of these I was on pretty high doses of stims. My RE started to think that my eggs are \"sensitive\" and the high stim doses were damaging them, because the crazy drop off from day 1 to day 3 is not normal. It's indicative of bad egg quality, but we're not sure if this is inherent to my eggs or caused by blasting them with a fuckton of stims every time.\n\nSo this was supposed to be our last cycle before moving on to donor. My RE had a patient come from another clinic who had similar problems and had done [this nutty protocol](http://i.imgur.com/RmeFRh5.jpg) with clomid and femara, and then a low dose of stims every other day. It ends with a lupron/HSG trigger and for some reason, a ton of ibuprofen on the days before retrieval. We also got to sneak into the clinic's RCT for something called SPERM CHIP which they are using instead of a centrifuge on the sperm. \n\nSo at retrieval we ended up getting 7 eggs, 6 mature, 5 fertilized, and three made it to day 3!! Of the ones that made it to day 3, 2 were really nice 8-cell guys.\n\nAfter so many years of torture it's impossible to imagine that any of this would actually result in a literal baby, but I am pretty stoked about just getting a few nice embryos.\n\nAnyway, thought I would share in case someone else has the same problems and wants to try something weird.

During this process they found that my cervix/uterus is crooked? (I'm still not sure which one to be honest and if that's what they even meant by what they told me). They also found several masses. I had the laparoscopy procedure done to remove the masses. While having the laparoscopy done they found I had a prolapsed uterus and fixed that too. I also had scar tissue but no endometriosis. After the surgery, he told us that we had a few options before having to think about IVF. One we could try on our own, two we could go ahead and start IUI, or three we could do both: try for a couple months then try IUI. I've heard of numerous people getting pregnant after having the laparoscopy, usually within 3 or 4 months. I'm on month 5. The first 4 months after the surgery I had regular periods. Then this month I'm right back where I was. I'm two weeks late, no sign of period, no pregnancy (had blood test done). I'm scared to start IUI because when I had the sono and hystero done I was in excruciating pain I think due to the crookedness of whatever. I've tried to look up about the IUI but of course it's all medical not really antedoctal. And if it is antedoctal it's more about how they got pregnant after however many times, etc. I need to know how painful it is. Is it like the sonohysterogram? If anyone tried before going IUI how long did you try? The other reason I'm scared to do IUI is because he told us 3 was all we could do before looking at IVF which we can't afford. Once I've done the 3 I feel like my baby making days will be over. I know we could try on our own again but it hasn't worked for 8 years so... I just need some advice. I know no one can tell me what to do and all of this is so personal but I'm so sick of hearing quit stressing and it will happen, everything happens when it's supposed to, etc. My poor husband is very understanding and listens when I vent but even he doesn't get it. And the last time I tried to talk to someone I made the mistake of talking to someone with kids and their response was if you can't afford IVF how are you going to afford kids.
