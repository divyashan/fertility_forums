We ask that all members familiarize themselves with them in full, but here are the key points:\n\n1. **All positive pregnancy test (beta &amp; HPT) results should ONLY be mentioned in the weekly results thread (stickied under this thread each week). Discussions of positive tests, including beta-hell / limbo, uncertain results, or early infertility pregnancy issues/fears should ONLY be discussed in this thread.**\n\n2. Mention of pregnancy or live children is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as we had success after x,y,z protocol). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed. Note that mentions of pregnancy loss are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area.\n\n3. Infertility is not cute, therefore cutesy acronyms (BD, AF (when used as a Aunt Flo), DH, embies, follies, etc) are banned. The full list of banned terms can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7t7092/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms_terms/). As we all know, AF means AS FUCK. Yes, there will be cursing.\n\n4. Infertility is stressful and it is easier to step on people\u2019s toes than you might think. Please consider the emotional state of others during discussion here. Venting, jealousy and bitterness is to be expected.\n \n5. No linking our posts outside of the infertility family.\n\n6. If you see a post that breaks any of our rules or is troublesome to you please **use the report button**. The mods are happy to assess and remove or address reported posts. Let's all help keep this a safe, supportive community.\n\n**Guidelines**\n\n* Use the dailies! There are AM &amp; PM threads posted by the automod. The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to treatment. The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.\n\n* Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. \n\n**Helpful Links**\n\nMembers of this sub can be here for a long time and certain posts can get repetitive. Please use the search function before posting questions that may be more common. A few helpful mega-threads and FAQ threads can be found at the links below:\n\n[General FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index)\n\n[What to expect / ask at your first RE visit](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/52thn6/big_comprehensive_post_what_to_expect_questions/)\n\nInjection tips/advice and dealing with needle phobia threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4c5ki3/tips_for_injections/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/58mqd2/tips_on_self_injecting/)\n\n[Donor eggs/sperm](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3g6eqi/using_third_party_reproduction_resources_for/)\n\n[IVF medication and pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/48axum/big_post_on_ivf_medication_pricing_and_information/)\n\n[My Transfer failed - Why?

you.\nFor those transitioning to child free life after infertility r/IFchildfree is a safe space for this.\n\nFor those with children who are experiencing infertility trying for more, r/secondaryinfertility or r/IFagain may be helpful and is a safe space to mention existing children while you explore your IF.\n\nThere is a sub just for male infertility as well if any of our male members would like to connect with others in their shoes. /r/maleinfertility\n\n---\n\n**LINKED RESULTS AND MONTHLY WAITING THREADS**\n\n Waiting | Results\n---------|---------\n**2019**

If I post anything incorrectly/inappropriately please let me know. \n\nI am a 37-year-old facing secondary infertility. \n\nIn March, we found out that I was expecting and was about 4 weeks along, but at 8 weeks lots of bleeding started and we learned that I had miscarried.  I had a natural (no D&amp;C) miscarriage bled and clotted for 34 freaking days. I was getting my HCG drawn on a weekly basis and finally, on May 6 the bleeding stopped.\n\nI started taking ovulation predictor kits, but never got a positive. Two months had passed with no period so in July I finally went in to see my obgyn. My OB prescribed me some progesterone to help jump start my period so we can start trying again and took some bloodwork. I got a follow-up call from my OB with the news that I have low ovarian reserve and there is a good chance I would not be able to conceive on my own. My FSH was at 16 and my AMH was .36. All of this was taken outside of a period so I was hoping the numbers were just way off.\n\nMy period came 5 days after I stopped the progesterone (August), and I got my period again \u2013 on time \u2013 in September. \n\nI met with a reproductive endocrinologist late September and we went over all the testing that would need to be done. We were waiting on my period to come so they could get me in for testing and of course - my period never came. \n\nI had some bloodwork taken and was put back on progesterone to jumpstart my period AGAIN. The following day I got a call that my FSH had skyrocketed to 45 and my AMH has dropped to .111. My RE wants me to come in on a weekly basis for bloodwork and I guess to monitor this crazy FSH issue. \n\nMy understanding is my RE cannot do anything unless my FSH is lowered drastically, but I am also terrified of the quick drop of my AMH is going to make me lose my chances of any type of egg retrieval. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I needed to get this all out, if I need advice or hope - but here I am.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14844, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Low AMH Super High FSH", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572119577, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/djexxk/low_amh_super_high_fsh/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "voluntarybutler", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_wcfcscp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571382638, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/djjuv9/disagreement_on_what_to_do_with_ivf_unwanted/", "gildings": {}, "id": "djjuv9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1ae87cfc-92a6-11e4-8e5a-22000b26873e", "link_flair_text": "Treatment Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 40, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/djjuv9/disagreement_on_what_to_do_with_ivf_unwanted/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1571382638, "score": 2, "selftext": "My husband and I are both 26.

I am devastated. There are so many implications for my general health and my fertility. \n\nI am not sure whether I am willing to knowingly give a future child a 50% chance of inheriting this from me. I don't think IVF with genetic testing is a promising option for me as a way to avoid passing the mutation on. I'm generally not a great candidate for IVF. Throw in the fact that BRCA1 would eliminate half of any embryos I might end up with, and the odds are looking really grim. I don't think I am in a place where I could handle (or afford) failed IVF cycles after the other losses I have already had along with this latest health news. I'm open to donor eggs. This is something I have already given a lot of thought to because of my past molar pregnancy history. \n\nHowever, I am left with so many questions about the order to do to things in... If I decide to continue to pursue pregnancy with my own eggs, how much longer do I try for before deciding I need to move on to a prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy (and possible mastectomy) for my own protection? If I decide not to pursue pregnancy with my own eggs, do I have the surgery(ies) first and then pursue pregnancy later on? Or do I try to get pregnant with donor eggs first and pursue surgery immediately after? \n\nI will be following up with a cancer genetic counselor in the next couple of weeks. I hope to get a clearer idea of what my next steps should be. In the meantime, if there are others who have grappled with a BRCA1 mutation diagnosis, I would appreciate any guidance on how this information has affected your decisions related to fertility.

I go to therapy once a week which has been helpful but sometimes the pain shows up outside of therapy hours and it's unbearable. None of my friends or family are going through this and they don't understand. While they are well meaning, talking to them has always made me feel worse afterwards.\n\nWork has been really busy which as been a blessing and a curse, and I work at home which is also a blessing and curse. At times I've been grateful because I have something to take my mind off of things and stay in my pjs, but other times have been hard because all I can do is grieve.\n\nToday was one of those days where I couldn't focus and I was getting angry with myself for not being able to cope. I tried to force myself to \"just work\" now and save my grieving for later, as if I could easily organize and schedule my feelings like a meeting in google calendar. Then I started to feel the stress and pain manifest itself in me physically.  My vision started to blur, my stomach started to ache, and legs started to go numb. I still tried to focus on work but tears started to trickle down my face. So after spending the first 5 hours of the morning forcing myself to work, I gave up and told myself that I need to allow myself some mental space away from work. \n\nI tried looking for some temporary relief - looking for and trying out online therapy chat rooms, reading about various infertility ways of coping, moving my body around, going for a walk, playing video games, reading reddit posts. This lasted for about an hour and all while having random moments of tears running down my face and getting frustrated that nothing was making me feel better. I started to get deeper and deeper into a negative mental space.\n\nSuddenly, I just started crying uncontrollably. I've cried a lot since my diagnosis, but since seeing my pregnant friend and the egg retrieval news, the frequency and intensity of my tears reached a whole new level. This afternoon, I leveled up once again and I cried in a way I never have before in my life.\n\nI screamed at the top of my lungs, I curled up in a ball on the floor, I pounded the floor ...all while tears, snot, and drool covered my face. It was the ugliest of ugly cries. After about 30-45 minutes of uncontrollable crying I suddenly stopped. I stood up and I literally felt lighter, it really felt like a weight had been lifted.\n\nI had no idea how liberating it would feel to just let all my anger and frustration out through really ugly, loud, chaotic crying. I know it's only temporary relief but I'm glad I discovered it. It's almost like taking advil for a migraine. I know it's not a cure but it makes the pain go from debilitating to manageable.\n\nAnyone else find ugly crying helps them?

Which basically means they cannot find any reason whatsoever why my daughters passed away I lost both of my daughters before my now current husband and I were married so my ex-husband pressured me into having my tubes tied after three months of nonstop daily badgering about it I finally agreed and relented. I always honestly felt and still feel in my heart that my ex husband had something to do with our daughter's passing. I've spoken with police about it and they have all basically said the same thing they were born early and there's no evidence of foul play . Yet , in my heart, I feel as if he did something. Especially when it comes to our second daughter our second daughter was born 1129 and I did not allow him around her or I at all we started speaking and talking again in May of the following year when our daughter was 6 months old and then I agreed to allow him to move back in June 2nd then our daughter passed away June 18th the medical examiner's can find no reason why she had passed even though I told them that on the night of June 17th our daughter had woke up crying so I had woken up her father and ask him if he could please get her a bottle because I was exhausted from breastfeeding all day next thing I know I fell back asleep and it was some morning of June 18th and that's when I found my daughter in her bed blue and cold I didn't CPR on her I was screaming and yelling and begging her father to call 911 he finally relented and called nine-one-one the EMTs got there and they had to pry me off of her because I did not want to stop doing CPR I honestly felt like it was my fault even though at the time I could not see the connection now I can look back and I can spot the connection even though I have spoken to so many different agencies over the past seven years they all tell me the same thing there is no evidence for me I don't need evidence I know what I feel in my heart. So needless to say after June 18th I refuse to be with him I move on with my life well not really moved on I miss my daughter more than words can say but I attempted to pick up my life and move on I finally years later met an absolutely amazing wonderful man.  fast forward 7 years later him and I have been divorced for 5 years and I have zero children my husband now and I have been married for going on for years we paid to have a tubal reversal done June 26th 2018, we've had zero luck getting pregnant I've gone to so many doctors I can't even count how many. The last reproductive endocrinologist talk I went to told me that my amh is . 008 he said he has never seen a number this small and a woman of my age I'm 31 years old this past year and a half has been a complete nightmare it's been hell for us I hate going out in public and seeing women that are pregnant or women with babies what's even worse is when I go somewhere and I see these women who hate their baby so much . \nOr where I hear from friends or neighbors about these women who do drugs while they're pregnant beat their kids, rape their kids,  and everything else. So now basically our only option is to do IVF with a donor egg it is ridiculous how expensive it is it's not fair I don't understand why I've been made to suffer so much yes I understand there are people who have it a lot worse but still I can't help but rage and be upset with God for putting us in this situation was it not enough but he took both of my daughters from me?

I think I waited because I had some vague hope that each step of the process might work the first time, and then I could skip merrily along to r/InfertilityBabies. Nope. I'm hoping to just participate in a supportive community. So few people in my life know that we are going through infertility, and I often feel very isolated.\n\n**Backstory:**\n\n* My (male) partner and I have been trying for almost two years total. I first met my REI doctor \\~8 months of trying because the emotional toll of not having success was high for both of us, and I was just so suspicious that something was wrong.\n* We (he?) ultimately received a diagnosis of severe MFI, with recommendation to go straight to IVF.\n* First round of IVF happened this past summer. We were warned that we could very well not end up with any embryos to transfer because of the underlying diagnosis, but we figured why not try at least once. In the end we were very, very lucky to have several embryos to freeze (no fresh transfer due to high risk of OHSS).\n* We did not do PGS. Based on my age, my doctor did not recommend it. Partner and I (mostly I) went back and forth a lot but ultimately decided not to spend thousands of $ on something that was not recommended. I still have some mixed feelings about this.\n* FET #1 officially failed as of this weekend. It was a chemical, and I also think my progesterone might've been lower than they wanted (PIO only made me sore after the first few injections, so I have a \\[hopefully irrational\\] fear that no pain = I was doing the shots wrong). Being that it's the weekend, I haven't heard from my doctor about any changes to my next cycle. I am ready to just move on to the next one, but **dreading** being back on birth control--it made me feel horribly depressed during my last cycle.\n\n**My Silver(ish) Linings:**\n\n* I'm grateful that our diagnosis is (hopefully) clear and that we went straight to IVF.\n* I'm grateful that I have some financial help from insurance, even if it's limited (I don't live in a state with mandatory IVF coverage).\n* I'm grateful that I have easy access to sub-specialty medical care, especially at a clinic that is very evidence-based and no-nonsense about their approach.\n* I was ambivalent about whether I wanted children for years. While I **hate** all this waiting now, it initially gave me time to think very hard about whether I actually want to be a parent (although I don't think anyone has to feel 100% sure before trying, ART or not).\n\nI felt absolutely terrible emotionally when I found out we officially had a chemical, but the initial pain is fading a bit. My partner is more optimistic than I am. I know the stats based on how many embryos we have left, but I also can't shake the feeling that there's just no chance this will ever work. I tend to feel most optimistic when I'm actively in treatments, probably because it feels like I'm *doing* something, as opposed to all the weeks of sitting around and waiting. It definitely feels like my life is on hold, and I have no idea how to change that...at the moment, there's nothing I can think of that we would be doing differently if we were child-free by choice.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14865, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Finally ready to introduce myself", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572157282, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dkike9/finally_ready_to_introduce_myself/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "janesn0w", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "29F | unexplained | 3 IUI | IVF next", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_anfmo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571583693, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dkkq5g/recommendation_for_an_insulated_cooler_pack/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dkkq5g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/dkkq5g/recommendation_for_an_insulated_cooler_pack/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1571583704, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey all, I\u2019m going to be traveling (about 8 hours door to door, 2 times) with medication and am looking for advice on which travel insulated cooler pack/ice pack combo to get.

As I\u2019m sure you can all imagine. \n\nBack in June we did our first round of IVF due to PCOS and severe MFI. In the end they found out that my eggs were of poor quality too and we only got 2 blastocysts. One was of poor quality and the other was of good quality. This is after they retrieved 26 eggs and only 5 fertilised with ICSI. \n\nI don\u2019t know why, but I decided I wanted to transfer the poor quality one first. As expected it didn\u2019t implant at all. This wasn\u2019t too much of a shock and we moved on in August to use our Grade A blastocyst.\nWe opted to not PGS test either of the blasts we had because it was a lot more money extra and we didn\u2019t want to pay to test just two. Plus I am under 30 so we were reassured the chance of abnormality was slightly lower for me. We took the gamble.\n\nI got a positive pregnancy test 5 days after my Grade A blastocyst transfer. But I never really felt ok about it. When they told me my due date (May 2020) I knew we wouldn\u2019t be having a baby in May 2020 at all. Something just didn\u2019t feel right but I put it down to my own anxiety, after all we had been trying to conceive for 4 years.\n\nI had a scan at 6 weeks and baby was growing fine with a strong heartbeat.\nI had another scan at 7 weeks and the story was the same. Strong heartbeat and right on target with their size.\n\nI went back at 9 weeks and this time they told me the baby was measuring 6 days behind what it should be but the heart was still strong. They reassured me it could just be a machine error. I knew in my heart that it wasn\u2019t.\n\nAt around 10 weeks, so 1 week after we found out baby was small, my pregnancy symptoms started disappearing. I had previously been hospitalised with severe pregnancy sickness and all of a sudden was... fine. My boobs also lost their soreness. Everyone kept insisting it was JUST THE PLACENTA KICKING IN!! I knew otherwise. \nMy husband began to get annoyed with me. One night he swore at me and told me I hadn\u2019t been happy \u2018at all\u2019 during this pregnancy and he thought I was looking for excuses to be miserable. He didn\u2019t realise I was miserable because I knew in my heart we were losing our baby or already had.\nI even had family constantly undermining me and telling me I was just negative. This is my body. I knew something wasn\u2019t ok. \n\nOn Friday just gone, we arrived at our clinic for some genetic testing as I wanted it doing months ago when we first started IVF. They did me an ultrasound first and sure enough, no heartbeat. Baby measuring 9 weeks and 2 days. No bleeding. Not really any pain. I\u2019ve got to be scheduled for a D&amp;C.\n\nThe most unfair thing is most miscarriages happen long before the 9 week mark. I\u2019ve lurked in the miscarriage subreddit and most of those ladies had baby\u2019s that stopped growing at 5-6 weeks. Ive barely seen any cases of a baby that just stops growing at 9 weeks. They were doing fine up until the 9 week mark. \n\nI\u2019ve shut myself down. I\u2019m so numb. I don\u2019t want to post in the miscarriage sub because I\u2019m pretty sure most women on there aren\u2019t infertile and I feel there is a special kind of agony when you miscarry as an infertile couple with no embryos on ice. \n\nWe\u2019re part of a shared risk program so in a few months I\u2019ll undergo IVF again for free, I guess.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14865, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Missed miscarriage after IVF - needing some support", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572159679, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dkl2a4/missed_miscarriage_after_ivf_needing_some_support/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Choosingfour", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4p9h7yqa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571586076, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dkl98p/what_can_cause_a_higher_fsh_but_normal_amh/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dkl98p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2839f5b6-18df-11e9-8133-0eec4405e856", "link_flair_text": "Introduction", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/dkl98p/what_can_cause_a_higher_fsh_but_normal_amh/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1571586077, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm 28 right now, and I went to the OB for my yearly and to discuss prenatals etc. She ran some blood work ( shes incredible), and my FSH was 9.6, estrogen normal (forgot number), and AMH was 3.5.

This will probably be long and ranty. I did read the rules but this is my first ever post on reddit so please let me know if it violates any rules/ nomenclature.\n\nI\u2019ve always seen my mother as very fertile. She had 3 children (one later in life with health complications) and was sure that, as her clone, I would have no problems conceiving when the time came. That being said, I was very conscious of my sexual health: condoms, birth control, selectivity when it came to partners. It wasn\u2019t till I met my husband that I wasn\u2019t extremely careful.\n\nAfter a year or so of marriage, we still hadn\u2019t had a baby despite trying naturally and myself tracking my cycle especially ovulation. When we went to see a doctor, they told me that I was too over weight to get pregnant naturally and to fix that before any additional tests were done.\n\nI won\u2019t bore you with the next 7+ years, but suffice it to say that weight loss, IUI, and adoption didn\u2019t help my fertility.\n\nCurrently we are at a point in our lives where IVF isn\u2019t an option due to cost (and honestly, I\u2019m not in a mental state to even ask the question).

That pretty much took the rest of July, all of August and September. (Also one small hemorrhagic cyst come up on my right side during during this time as well) Now during this entire time on Provera I had not stop spotting, which was super annoying especially during the summer. On October 3rd I saw my doc for another appointment and this time everything was gone . I didn\u2019t take my pill that night, so I officially stopped on October 2nd. Now all that needed to happen was start my period and move on to trying our 3rd IUI cycle. Well a little over two weeks out since last pill and still no period. I\u2019ve call the office and the nurse wanted to give it the weekend and then see what happened. If nothing I\u2019ll go for blood work and an ultrasound this up coming week. \n\nI\u2019m just looking to see if anyone else has been on Provera longer than 10 days straight? If so how long and did it mess with your cycle? \n\nTL;DR: on provera for 82 days, have been off it for over 2wks and still no period.

We had a 2 hour talk last night, one of many over the last year or so.  It\u2019s not a fight, it\u2019s always respectful and calm even though there are tears, but there is still never a resolution.  This morning I got up and cried more, and wrote this on my phone trying to get my thoughts out therapeutically.\n\n\nIt hurts...\nI knew you weren\u2019t crazy about having kids when we met, at 25 and you at 27, hell it wasn\u2019t on my radar either.  When all my friends were having kids in their 20\u2019s it seemed foreign, something I wanted no part in.  A part of it was that Mom couldn\u2019t be a grandma to them, and she would have been amazing and that broke my heart.  The other was I just didn\u2019t envision it, it wasn\u2019t on my list of priorities-maybe later I would think to myself.\nThen as our relationship grew those first few years, I found myself daring to think of us being married and get together long term and perhaps having a kid or two.  If you made a comment of \u201cwhen we have kids\u201d, or \u201cour kids\u201d it felt right and I could picture it.  But first I wanted to be stable and get my degree, not a good time for a family.  Then you lost your job and we struggled financially, not a good time for a family.  It was fine though, because it seemed like once we got through that we would be set, more stable, and you in a career you didn\u2019t hate.  Then I gained so much weight I worried that it would even be safe to carry, so it was going through weight loss surgery and put it off yet again, but it seemed like the right thing to do.  That would mean that I would be 36 almost 37 when we started trying again, but people do it all the time.  Then we didn\u2019t get pregnant for a year of trying, so it was time to get fertility testing done to see what\u2019s going on.  We just needed some answers.  Then the dreaded IVF was presented as the only option for me at age 38.5 years old and you at 40, and the cost of 28K made it impossible.  Except...your parents offered to help and/or we could finance some of it....it almost...almost seemed possible. It was dangling on a string right in front of me, but I couldn\u2019t dare spend that kind of money with no promise of success...that\u2019s a new car regardless of where the money came from!  Again, it moved further and further alway from me.  Is that what makes me want it more?  How certain am I that I want this, how certain are you that you don\u2019t?  \n\nI\u2019ve said that my options are: \n1-Stay....Convince you to try this more affordable IVF since you are good with us naturally getting pregnant, why is that such a leap?  Is it because you know it won\u2019t likely happen naturally, so it\u2019s your way of giving a little?  But then you say that you would be fine if we got pregnant...is it just your way to not have to make a decision, proactively go after this?\n2-Stay...Come to terms with not having children and decide what else my life is to be filled with.  What does it look like?  Will I resent you, or will we be happy for the next 30+years as we have been for these past 13?   There has to be some thought and planning in this decision...we can\u2019t just say, we\u2019ll take it day by day...that\u2019s not living and enjoying life.  Are we going to travel?  Volunteer?  Is fostering an option? \n\nWhat bothers me the most is when you said you assumed I would leave you, as if you are ok with that, like that\u2019s even an option for me.  I think I know that you aren\u2019t really ok, but you\u2019re so monotone about it, no emotion, no pain from that possibility, it makes me feel like I love you more than you love me because I will stay either way.  I know that\u2019s childish to say, but I\u2019m willing to work through this.  \nI don\u2019t just want to be a mom in general, i want to be a parent WITH you.  I love us, I\u2019ve always loved us and the relationship we built together.  The trust, love, friendship, support, communication, everything about it that make us special, and an all around great and happy couple.  That\u2019s why it hurts when you think that I could just toss it away....I\u2019m stuck because the 2 things I want to line up, don\u2019t.  There isn\u2019t a 3rd option, at least not for me.  So I feel like I\u2019m being held hostage, even though I\u2019m not.  \n\nYou said if we were 5-10 years younger this wouldn\u2019t be an issue, you would be willing to go through it.  That\u2019s not fair to say that because we couldn\u2019t have done it then, the only option is to do it now.  So what were both basically 40, we\u2019ve still got a lot of years in front of us.  \n\nI know you\u2019re concerned about the actual IVF process and what it would do to me emotionally and our relationship.  But I\u2019m more worried about what NOT doing it will do to me and us.  If we do it, then we know that we actually tried.  Up to this point I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve tried, no real additional effort to see if this can happen for us.  Once we\u2019ve done this, then we know, and I have no choice but to mourn and accept it.  \n\nBut what if I\u2019m wrong about wanting a kid?  What if I push you to do IVF and we get pregnant, and then one or both of us is unhappy being a parent?  Then you will resent me or I will hate myself for trying so hard for something that I thought I wanted and then regretting it. \n\nWhy is this so hard?  Why can\u2019t we just have a surprise like so many others and we don\u2019t have to make this conscious decision and painful journey for something that may or may not happen.\n\nThank you for letting me vent, get this off my chest.  My husband and I have talked a lot about this whole thing, but can\u2019t get to any sort of common ground.

(You might remember me from my giant [split-cycle experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bcvmip/split_cycles_on_being_a_human_science_experiment/) last spring.) As a result of our 4 prior retrievals, we ended up with 6 PGS normal blasts of varying genetics and grades: \n   * 2 with our own DNA but very poor morphology (C-)\n   * 3 donor egg embryos (B+, B+, and C)\n   * 1 donor sperm embryo (C-)\n   * and 1 low level mosaic with our DNA (aneuploid +5, +14, grade C-)\n* **FET #1** **(TW: loss)****:** We transferred our best-looking embryo with our DNA (day 6, grade C-, PGS normal) in the spring. Assuming that my autoimmune issues would come into play, we did a \"kitchen sink\" medicated FET with added prednisone, intralipids, neupogen, and lovenox. The embryo implanted right away (I had a positive FRER on 4dp5dt), but my HCG levels were low from the start (46 on 9dp5dt). My clinic told me not to worry about the actual HCG level because it was doubling perfectly and we hit all of our milestones on time. By week 7 they said it didn't matter that HCG was on the lower end (around 15,000 at that point) because the baby was measuring perfectly and had a strong heartbeat (150). A few days after that visit, they told me to stop the prednisone and most of my supplements. Just when we had started to relax a bit, at our \"graduation\" appointment we found out that the baby no longer had a heartbeat. She was measuring at exactly 8 weeks, and must have died only 1-2 days before the scan. We had [POC testing done through LabCorp](https://www.labcorp.com/test-menu/39841/microarray-products-conception-poc-reveal\u00ae-ffpe#), in case she was one of the 4% of embryos whose PGS results are inaccurate. This confirmed that she was euploid, as the initial PGS test (through Igenomix) had found. (However, the LabCorp POC testing cannot detect balanced rearrangements or low level mosaicism, so I suppose that's still a possibility.) With this information, my RE said his only regret is that he didn't keep me on prednisone longer.\n* **Retrieval #5:** Based on the fact that I had successfully been pregnant, my RE had renewed hope for us and convinced us to try one more retrieval; he felt so strongly about it that he gave us a discount and also offered to simultaneously transfer \"our\" last blast for free. We repeated the same microdose lupron protocol that had worked in cycle 4, with a few minor tweaks: I was on prednisone during stims (to prep for transfer), I had been on metformin for a few extra months, I took a higher dose of methylfolate, and we used the Zymot device (because if my eggs are shitty, why not surround them with only the best sperm?). Shockingly, we ended up with 3 day 6 blasts, graded B+, B+, and B-:  Our absolute best round yet, in terms of blast rate and morphology. We're still waiting on PGS results, though, and assuming we'll get nothing because historically, 80% of my blasts are \"chaotic abnormal.\"\n* **FET #2:** This was a \"fresh\" transfer of our last frozen blast that shared DNA with both of us (day 6, grade C- with \"questionable ICM,\" PGS normal), on day 5 after our last retrieval. We did the same kitchen sink autoimmune protocol as last time, but with higher doses of prednisone. And of course, my uterine environment could have been different because it was a fresh cycle rather than a medicated FET. On the day of transfer, the embryo thawed ok but clearly did not look good. The embryologist said she still couldn't visualize an inner cell mass, and stressed multiple times that it was very poor quality and that \"we usually don't freeze blasts of such low quality.\" I'm now 8 days post transfer and very clearly not pregnant, but I need to wait until Tuesday for my beta. I'm still taking my PIO though, in hopes that I can delay my period by a few days and buy us time to talk to my RE and make decisions about what to do next. Although this was a failed transfer, we're not rushing to blame my body because we know that the embryo was such poor quality (my husband actually said, \"this one doesn't count\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QUESTION: Can anyone think of any additional testing or interventions we should pursue before doing a 3rd transfer?** \n\n* We might have the opportunity to start another FET cycle this week; otherwise we'd probably have to wait until January due to the annual lab closure in late December.\n* Assuming we're down to the donor-created embryos, we'd possibly be willing to gamble *one* of them on a 3rd FET right away. However, after that (or if we manage to get a normal from cycle 5), the remaining embryos will all be unique in terms of parentage, quality, and gender. So while on the one hand, **we've never tried an FET with a good-quality embryo** (and maybe that's all we need!), on the other hand we also don't want to \"waste\" any unique embryos on a repeat of the same protocol if there's anything else we should be trying first.\n* **We've never consulted with a reproductive immunologist;** given my existing autoimmune diseases, my RE just gave me the \"kitchen sink\" autoimmune protocol without testing. However, I wonder if maybe the prednisone or the intralipds could do more harm than good (since my diseases are well-controlled at the moment, and I've heard that some natural killer cells are needed for implantation), *or* if testing would reveal the need for additional or more precise autoimmune treatments.\n* **The only known abnormality we haven't yet addressed is that my beta 3 integrin came back low** (as measured by ReceptiveDx during a natural cycle). My RE believes this doesn't have an effect during medicated FETs - and also thinks that because I achieved implantation before, it's a moot point. My understanding is that low beta 3 integrin is associated with implantation failure. But I also wonder if it can lead to *poor* implantation - essentially, a pregnancy that is doomed to miscarry. But there doesn't seem to be enough research to determine this. My understanding from searching this sub is that the treatment for low beta 3 integrin is to take lupron for 2 months before FET, which sounds like the least fun thing in the world - but I'm wondering if those of you who know more about this think I should try it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Medical History &amp; Infertility Testing:**\n\n* My health history includes 2 autoimmune diseases: **ulcerative colitis**, which has been controlled for the past few years by weekly Humira injections, and **Hashimoto's Disease**, diagnosed by thyroid nodule biopsy and very mildly elevated thyroid antibodies (anti-TPO = 13). My TSH, T3, and T4 levels have always been in the normal range, so I haven't required any treatment. We just consider my thyroid to be a ticking time-bomb that needs frequent monitoring. My doctors think my poor egg quality is likely related to some underlying autoimmune mechanism.\n* I have a small **prolactinoma** currently controlled by cabergoline.\n* My ERA came back normal/receptive during a mock medicated FET cycle; we followed this timing for my first FET.  \n* I've **always wondered if I have endometriosis** because my periods are very painful and extremely heavy, with large clots (the clots make super tampons useless, and I can overflow a diva cup in an hour).\n* ReceptivaDx came back normal during my mock FET cycle: BCL-6 expression was low (0.6), suggestive of a low risk of endometriosis. However, it did say that my endometrium was out of phase:  \"secretory endometrium with **glandular stromal dyssynchrony** with glands postovulatory day 3 (day 17) and stroma postovulatory day 9 (day 23).\" My RE said this was a typical result for a medicated cycle, and that he trusts ERA results more than he trusts the older endometrial phase tests.\n* We repeated the ReceptivaDx during an unmedicated cycle after our loss, in order to test for beta 3 integrin. The biopsy was taken 7 days after my LH surge, and 6 or 7 days after ovulation. This time my endometrium was in-phase, but **beta 3 integrin was low (0.4),** \"which may represent a luteal phase defect.\" From searching the sub and reading a few research studies, I see that this finding is associated with implantation failure. My RE isn't overly concerned about it because I achieved implantation with our first FET.\n* Hysteroscopy has always looked good, though I did have a small **polyp** removed and was treated for **endometritis** prior to my first FET. A hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in between my loss and FET #2 confirmed that the endometritis had not come back.\n* My RPL panel came back normal, aside from the MTHFR.\n* My [Fertilome results](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8vo4k8/fertilome_results_pof_rpl/) include moderate risk factors for primary ovarian insufficiency (**GDF9),** and repeated pregnancy loss due to immune response regulation (**IL18),** and blood circulation issues (due to being compound heterozygous for **MTHFR**). I take a methylfolate supplement for the MTHFR.\n* It probably doesn't matter now that we're not planning any future retrievals, but in addition to the methylfolate I take [a ton of other supplements](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/b3oqo1/thursday_am_active_treatment_thread/ej1qr1n?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). (But then again, our loss happened only a few days after I stopped the supplements.)\n* HSG was clear in November 2017.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading!

I see there are some older threads about this topic, but the most recent was 6 months back, so I figure it's fair game to start a new one. Sorry, mods, if that was the wrong call. \n\nMy situation: I just had my first FET yesterday, and I'm back to my normal life tomorrow. A big part of my normal life is exercise. I work in the cycling x tech industry, and riding a bike is a big part of my life. I ride my bike to work and usually add some miles on in the mornings to get some additional saddle time. Lately, I've been riding somewhere around 10 hours per week at moderate intensity (average HR is usually about 140). I'm not doing any intervals or really high intensity exercise, and I'm also not doing any long rides like I used to (2 hours is my limit for now). \n\nPart of what I think is tough about getting good info on this topic is the fact that there doesn't seem to be much in the way of standard amounts, types, or intensities of exercise that are deemed acceptable or unacceptable, and an individual's history doesn't seem to factor much into the equation. My current routine is pretty moderate for me, a former bike racer who used to train and race for 20 hours a week. However, for someone with a different history, 10 hours at 140HR is a lot. \n\nI've asked my clinic for guidance on this and provided them with specific information about what I'm currently doing, but I would love to hear from anyone here who has found any good information on this topic.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14881, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Exercise and fertility treatment", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572191048, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dli21u/exercise_and_fertility_treatment/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MichaellaJane", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": "37F, 8 IUIs, IVF, FET #2 6/17, unexplained.", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8w7af", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571757833, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dljfum/menopur_and_pio_up_for_grabs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dljfum", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/dljfum/menopur_and_pio_up_for_grabs/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1571757834, "score": 1, "selftext": "Moving and will take to a clinic on Friday if no one here wants, if you have a need let me know and I can shop to you. \n(13 vials Menopur, 4 PIO)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14881, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Menopur and PIO up for grabs", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572192369, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dljfum/menopur_and_pio_up_for_grabs/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "msjs91011", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_twudd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571758130, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dlji7l/working_toward_fet_number_1/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dlji7l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/dlji7l/working_toward_fet_number_1/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1571758132, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello.

She is 5 years younger than me, got married and had a kid a few years ago before she started at our office. She does not have to take care of her parents and she comes from wealth. I have to take care of my parents (child of immigrants), and we grew up poor so I always wanted to be the good daughter by finding a good job so I could take care of them. I also looked forward to having a kid so that they could share their culture with my kid. I also knew that me having a kid would make them very happy.\n\nAnyways, my coworker and I became pretty close and she was one of the first people I told about my infertility because she was one of the first people I saw after I got the diagnosis from my doctor. I was diagnosed with POI and my symptoms were really bad. I have the bone density of a 55 year old (I\u2019m 35) I was severely vitamin deficient, and had sleep disturbances because of the POI (a lot of this went away after HRT and taking vitamins and calcium). I had been telling her for a few years that I don\u2019t feel well and I think something is wrong. Then when I told her my diagnosis and I can\u2019t have kids, she said \u201coh, I thought you said you were sick. You can just adopt!\u201d I never mentioned it to her again.\n\nThat was last year. Her grandmother passed away recently and I was so sad for her. The office pitched in and gave her hugs, we told her how much we loved her, and she was so thankful. And she later said she wasn\u2019t that close to her grandmother and is not really affected by the loss. When she told me that my heart sank. I was so jealous. She got so much love and support from her work community about a loss that didn\u2019t even affect her. At the same time I desperately wish I could have gotten a hug or some non-judgmental comments about my situation (1 donor egg retrieval and used my life savings so can\u2019t do another one). But I know if I share my situation I will be dismissed and judged. I will be pitied and invalidated and so I would rather not say anything. \n\nI love her as a friend but it is so hard being around her. I hate seeing how her life is progressing because it\u2019s a reminder of what I don\u2019t have and I don\u2019t have direction. It doesn\u2019t help that she\u2019s younger than me and has social support and financial support. I know her life isn\u2019t perfect but I can\u2019t help but focus on what she has and I don\u2019t. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to cope with being around a friend that has it all.
