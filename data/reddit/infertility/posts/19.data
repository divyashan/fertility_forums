I love her to death.  From the start, I knew that getting pregnant would be difficult.  She has endometriosis, and has suffered from a ruptured ovarian cyst.  She has had surgery to remove the extra tissue and the remnants of it.  We were told that within the next six to nine months would be the absolute best time to conceive.  Try hard!  This was last year around August.  Through it all, I have sat by her side and comforted her to the best of my ability.  We are happily married and I wouldn't trade this for anything.  Both of us want a baby.  People constantly ask us.  Many don't know of her situation, other than close family and a few friends.  We love kids and we are told time and time again what excellent parents we'd be.  I know that being good with someone else's kids doesn't necessarily equate to how you'd raise your own, but, I digress.  We want a baby.\n\nThis past week, we felt that we were finally there!  She was late on her period by almost two weeks and everything was feeling right.  I didn't want to chance anything so I kept my distance, ie, I didn't want to rub her belly or get all cutesy knowing that this could all be for naught.  Anyway, a few days ago, her period came, and it came hard.  Massive chunks, clots and the like spilled out.  This morning, it was just as bad as the first day.  She suspects that she miscarried.  She is absolutely devastated.  I am, too.  I am a contractor working full time with no benefits, she is working part time with state paid benefits.  We can't afford a specialist.  We'd love to talk to a professional and find out what our best options would be.  We both fear that it will be an astronomical expense, but, does that really matter?  All we want is for her to carry our child, a healthy child and bring it in to this world without complication.  She gets so frustrated, so depressed, when she sees girls getting pregnant where the baby's *father* leaves the second he finds out, or a girl is pregnant and she didn't even realize it.\n\nI am doing all I can do to support her and help elevate her morale.

She was diagnosed in her twenties, me in my 30s right as I started TTC.  She's basically had it for 10 years, and I have moved on to DE(ggs).  She randomly got pregnant right as I was starting my first DE cycle.  Which is so exciting and I'm really happy for her.  What a miracle, right??  10 years of menopause and at 35 and you are pregnant?  Its amazing.  \n\nSo I am in the middle of this DE cycle and hoping that, obviously, it will work.  We have run the entire gamut of this - like acupuncture, weird Chinese teas, little Chinese pills, moxa sticks, nettles extracts, CoQ10, DEA, IUI, IVF, a camping trip, relaxing, whatever - just everything science, non-science, stupid and not stupid and it has all been super depressing and nothing has worked.  So we are here.  So yesterday my beta came back negative and I was sad and shocked despite my best emotional preparations, and zen like knowledge that we can do this again.  \n\nSo with her miracle pregnancy my sister has become a complete expert on fertility!  She was like, you really need to use a heating pad on your stomach and go to acupuncture 3 times a week and shake your body a lot so your blood starts to flow and I was like, 'I totally get that you are coming from a place of kindness but I have actually done all of these things and am finding my own ways to process', and so then she started sending me links to acupuncture near my office and I'm just like dude fucking chill.  Stop blaming me for not doing something.  Your advice isn't real or fair and I don't appreciate it.  I have a plan for how to process and remain calm (obviously not working at all!) and I know you are trying to help but this is just really not helpful.  (Just as an example - I don't have time or $$ for acupuncture.)  \n\nSo then I told my mom and she was like well next time you have to make sure you put in a couple of embryos.  And I'm like stop!  These are complicated medical decisions.  We make based on science and not rumors.

This is my very first post to Reddit. My husband finally convinced me to join after I kept asking him to send me the infertility thread, so here I am. We have been trying since October 2014 and are in our mid-30s. After numerous tests that show that we are both fine (although I do have numerous fibroids and had one polyp removed back in August that could have been a fertility issue), I am still not pregnant. It is unexplained infertility for us. I didn't want to get my hopes up back in August but unfortunately I did and really thought that the polyp removal would help us get pregnant. It didn't. We did our first IUI (letrosol meds and ovidrel shot) in January. Still not pregnant. In the process of the second IUI and suspect we'll be at this for a few more months. Just found out that our insurance doesn't cover any aspect of IVF so if the IUI doesn't work at some point, we're not sure what we will do. I am afraid to have hope, but I also know that positive energy and positive thinking can lead to positive results in various aspects of life. So how does everyone stay hopeful? How do you get through each day and each month without crying every time you think about this? How do I get past the depression of being a failure every month with no explanation as to why we are failing?

I'm 36, husband is 38. We've been actively trying for most of 2015 and my \"plan\" was to get pregnant before my 36th bday in September. Well it didn't happen for me, though apparently every single woman I've met in my life did get pregnant... sigh. \n\nAnyway, in November, I decided we needed to make sure all was good. I was convinced my hypothyroidism, though controlled, was the issue. The RE had me do  all the blood tests, HSG, etc and all was fine. My husband's semen analysis was not fine however. \nHis count was under 1 million with 8% viability, low motility, basically bad all around. He took HCG shots for 2 months and I had him on a whole cocktail of vitamins, tried to improve diet (though there was a lot of holiday drinking). We also saw a urologist who just said wait for the second results and then we'll see.\n\nWe got the second results yesterday - viability went up to 12%, some slight improvement, but the count is still at 1 million (which I think really means 1 million or less). \n\nThe thing is, my husband had an ex-gf who got pregnant from him years ago. So he was fertile at one point. I also only found out when this started that he had surgery as a child to lower an undescended testicle. So that's obviously a factor against us.\n\nI'm on the edge waiting for our next appt. Is the RE going to say, go straight to IVF/ICSI? or are there test they can do to make sure it's not some sort of physical issue with him - blockage or the like? Or since there was a little bit of improvement with the meds, to keep doing that for longer? Seems like IUI is not an option right now and I'm eager to get going with my age.\n\nI'd love to hear from anyone who had a similar story and hear how it played out. \n\nI NEVER in a million years thought infertility would be something I'd deal with.

I have mentioned in this sub before that while he is overall an awesome guy, he is not very good in the empathy/sympathy department. Specifically, I have told him before that I am finding pregnancy announcements upsetting - this first came up when he let his brother surprise me with an announcement when my husband knew ahead of time they were pregnant, and my husband didn't want to ruin their surprise. Also when my best friend got pregnant, I told my husband that although I was of course happy for them I was also kind of jealous and sad. So he knows about my issue. Today on the local news the female anchor says something like ok guys, I have an announcement to make, the other anchors already know, but we're going to show some pictures that speak for themselves. I turned the TV off without comment b/c I didn't want to see the u/s photos (it turned out to be cute little kid with the \"i'm a big sister T-shirt). The hubs got mad and was like I don't see why you get so upset, people get pregnant all the time and you're being totally ridiculous trying to ignore it and getting angry. Then he says that he doesn't want to fight with me. I said I don't want to fight with you either, but you started it by telling me I was ridiculous, and  I asked why couldn't he have just left the TV off for a minute? \n\nI did some google searching and found some articles and blog posts about how other women are upset by announcements too, as well as some articles that generally talk about men being supportive during IVF. However, what I'm really looking for is an article that tells men hey, pregnancy announcements can be upsetting for your wife and you don't have to understand or agree with it, just be supportive and give advanced warning about announcements and don't try to force her to hear or things that you know will upset her. Anyone have any material like this? Even outside of infertility, an article that speaks about the need to be supportive without necessarily being in agreement would be helpful. Thanks so much in advance!!\n\nEDIT (update): Your excellent advice, support, and words of wisdom is why I love this sub and how I stay sane.

She said they're all around 17mm too!! She said no IUI and no intercourse.\n\nConsidering we have tried 4 cycles of just Femara with TI and never more than q or 2 follicles. Plus after a month or two of Fertilaid my husband's numbers are definitely a little better...I want to have sex anyway. If this is truly a bad idea then someone please talk me out of it.

No known issues with my wife but no success so far.\n\nSo, we decided we should finally make an appointment to see and RE to make sure there aren't some hidden issues with my wife and to get the ball rolling for IUI if we continue to be unsuccessful. The problem is, we live 2.5 hours from the nearest fertility clinic. I asked if we could do the initial consultation on the phone and was told that the doctor requires anyone \"local\" to do it in-person and basically won't do a phone consult unless you need to fly to get there.\n\nSo we both took off work at lunchtime yesterday and drove all the way there, gave them all our info and past test results. We were hoping that we'd be able to do some initial tests while we were there (at least the blood draws or SA). Instead we had a brief (&lt;15 minutes) and  rushed meeting with the doctor, who too one look at my latest (improved) SA results and seemed to adopt the attitude of \"why are you here? you're fine.\" He said that we will want to do HSG and ultrasound on my wife but those will require two separate visits and he doesn't trust the doctors in our home town to do them so we have to drive all the way to his office on short notice dictated by my wife's cycle. \n\nI was hoping he would at least provide us some more information on IUI, IVF, etc. but he didn't. Luckily I've been hanging out in this sub long enough that I know a lot more than most people, but still, you'd think at the initial visit the doctor would explain things to you. Maybe I would have had more questions if he had spent any time at all talking about the procedures! It would have been nice to at least hear him say \"Oh yes, I've seen cases similar to yours before. Here's what we did and the success rate, etc.\"\n\nSo we ended up skipping half a day of work and driving 5 hours (2.5 there, 2.5 back) for a 15 minute conversation that didn't tell us anything new which could have been done over the phone. And we were charged $290 dollars for the privilege. I was really hoping to start getting the tests done as soon as possible and to have an informative conversation with a caring doctor to make the trip worthwhile. But nope, that will require several more trips.\n\nSigh. At least we've started the process. I'll feel a lot better about continuing to try to conceive naturally once my wife is tested and we can be sure there aren't any complications on her side. And it will be nice to have a plan to start trying IUIs after a certain amount of time if that turns out to be the next step.\n\nAnyway, TL;DR - Had to skip work and drive to RE's office 2.5 hours away for a brusque 15 minute meeting that didn't particularly make us feel welcome and didn't teach us anything new or give us much more of a plan than we already had.\n\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Annoyed after first RE appointment", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/44cjnf/annoyed_after_first_re_appointment/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1454709741, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/44d4ob/pros_and_cons/", "gilded": 0, "id": "44d4ob", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 24, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/44d4ob/pros_and_cons/", "retrieved_on": 1459161237, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "What was good this week?

I should be the most fertile person ever- perfect AMH, FSH, hormones, etc. I respond well to meds. Husband has huge sperm count- around 400-550million, 35% motility- which isn't good but more than makes up for it in count, and okay morphology. Both have normal karyotypes. I've done a RLP and have slightly elevated PAI-1, which is a clotting thingie, but I've been told that tons of people have it and it's not a big deal but they do put on on lovenex for egg transfers. My thyroid is well controlled and not due to Hashi's. I don't have celiac's disease. My two IVFs were weird. A lap was the next step to figure out if there was asymptomatic endometriosis. \n\nTo prep for this, my RE asked that I stop all supplements and vitamins for 2 weeks, the metformin for 3 days, bath the night before, and not eat or drink after midnight.  I wondered about lady-grooming and opted to go ahead and groom a bit.  I'm not a full bare lady, I like a patch of hair but I tightened up the boundaries, if you know what I mean.  \n\nMy lap was done at a surgery center. We checked in at the front desk and I was called back sans husband to get ready.  I was in one of those big rooms sectioned off with curtains. They asked for a urine sample. I assume it was to check if I'm pregnant (lol, no) but they had the tact not to say that. I got naked and put on my gown and those no-slip socks. The nurse placed the IV in my hand and started saline. The saline made my mouth taste funny and I felt a tad nauseated, but that could have easily been nerves.  I really hate needles and IVs are the worst.  (I use [tattoo numbing cream](http://www.amazon.com/NumbMAX-Maximum-Strength-Topical-Anesthetic/dp/B018A0VI6G/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454710691&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=tattoo+numbing+cream) and I swear it helps.  I also use it for blood draws.)  The nurse gave me an anti-nausea patch for behind my hear and said I can wear it for 3 days but it gives many people dry mouth. The nurse then got husband.  We waited for 10-20 minutes and then the anesthesiologist came in and asked me about allergies and if I've had bad experiences with anesthesia prior.  I've never had any sort of surgery other than egg retrievals and I know this anesthesia is general instead of twilight.  Then my RE came in and discussed the procedure.  We did a laparoscopic inspection of the outside of my uterus, ovaries, and surrounding areas, a hysterscopy to look inside my uterus, and he ran dye through my tubes again.  He also injected some sort of oil into my uterus after everything. I can't remember what it is called but he said it helps IVF be successful 2.4% more.  I will be sure to ask more about this oil at my follow up in a couple weeks.  If he found endo he would remove it. He asked me what my favorite pain medication was and I laughed and told him I don't have a drug of choice, that whatever is usually fine. \n\nA nurse then walked me back to the surgery area.  It was cold as fuck back there, I was reasonably sure my nipples were attempting to revolt off my body. I laid down on the table and the lovely nurses bundled me up with blankets (perhaps fearing for their eyes if my nipple goes pinging around the room like a stray bullet).  I did not have to schooch, I got to lay in the middle of the table! Woo!  There were heavy duty stirrups but I didn't have to place my legs in them. The anesthesiologist said he was running some lidocaine into the IV, which was extremely cold, made my mouth taste medicine-y, and made me slightly nauseated.  Then he started the propofol, which burns a little going in the hand, and the room started to get spinny, the ceiling started the wave like an ocean, and you have flashbacks of being in college and drinking way too much apple cider and vodka that one night, and that's all I remember until waking up.\n\nI woke up in the recovery room- another one of those large rooms with curtains- to a nurse saying my name. I had three immediate and pressing concerns: I had to pee like a motherfucker, I had painful intense cramping, and I was pretty nauseated. I decided that peeing was the most important problem at that moment. The nurse said I probably didn't have to pee, but the catheter had irritated my urethra and was making me feel that way, but she got me a bedpan anyway, and a washcloth. Using a bedpan is another first for me today; she was right, I didn't have to pee, very little came out but I held the washcloth on my urethra for a few minutes and that helped. The nausea and cramping were pretty bad, so the nurse gave me some ginger ale and saltines and said I needed to eat a couple before taking the pain pill (norco, 7.5).  Never has a person ever been more grumpy while choking down saltine crackers. They turned to a crazy dry paste in my mouth and it took all of my yoga breathing to get them down and stay down.  The nurse helped me into my underwear with a pad in it, and then into a chair, and she swore sitting up with my knees drawn in would help, and again, she was right.  I felt really woozy, disoriented, and dizzy. The anesthesiologist came in and told me the nausea was normal and that young, smaller, women were most likely to get it and he had given me tons of anti-nausea meds in my IV.  I didn't have any gas/shoulder pain. The nurse got husband and it seemed like very quickly they were telling me I could get dressed and leave if I wanted. The RE came in and gave husband a CD of the procedure and a quick synopsis of what they found.  The pain meds kicked in and the cramps were better so husband dressed me and we and came home.\n\nThe cramps and nausea have continued to get better.  I napped until husband woke me to make more pain meds (he's very concerned about 'staying in front of the pain'.)  I've been hanging out with the pups and cats, watching netflix, and doing okay.  Shoulders are okay i I am laying down and get moderately ouchy if I am upright, nausea gone, cramping is gone too.  I have muscle weakness and the feeling of very sore muscles in my lower belly, like I did the worst most vicious pilates workout. Super dry mouth.  I have two incisions in addition to the belly button.  Oh!  And THEY SHAVED ME!  Got a surprise when I saw that!  Wish they would have taken the opportunity to do a nice full Brazilian wax.  I've always wanted to try it but don't want to suffer through it.  My throat isn't sore but I have a pretty raspy 30+ years-two-packs-per-day smokers voice right now.  I am bleeding about the amount of a light-medium period day.  Peeing is unpleasant- a little like peeing when I have a UTI, but I don't have the constant urgency.  I feel pretty sleepy and lovey-dovey towards husband. I can stand up straight and walk around by myself. Overall I would say that I'm having an easier time of it than many.\n\nPreliminary results, if interested.  I had 1-2 tiny spots of endo on each ovary and 2 or 3 spots on the back of my uterus and bladder.  On the cd my doc says 'well, hopefully that was enough to be significant' and in person I asked him if it was enough to explain the infertility and he shrugged and said 'well, it wasn't helping', which I took as a noncommittal no. Inside of uterus looked good, tubes looked perfect.  \n\nEndo is a terrible disease and I'm happy not to have it. I am now even more concerned about that elusive thing called egg quality that can't be tested for.  I feel like we are running out of other explanations.  I have a follow-up appointment with the RE in a couple weeks.\n\nAnd I have a CD of the procedure!  Pretty nifty!  Ovaries and uteruses are way tinier than I thought!\n\nQuestions welcome. \n\nEDIT: also, the subject of kids somehow came up with my recovery nurse and I asked her if she had kids.  She said she was expecting in May after needing fertility help.  It made me feel happy and weepy for her.  Part of the sisterhood!\n\nEdit 2, the next day: Super sore and tender belly. Difficult to engage those muscles so getting up out of bed sounds like a series of grunts and positive self talk 'okay, Salty, you can do this, 1, 2, 3, UP!'. Shoulder/gas pain still happens when I am upright for more than a minute or two, which is annoying because I'm getting bored laying around. Mildly sore throat. I took the nausea patch off so my dry mouth is much better.  Still taking a norco about every 4 hours to stay comfortable.\n\nEDIT 3: Two days after surgery. I'm feeling a ton better. Gas pain in my shoulders and diaphragm yesterday got pretty intense, far more painful than my belly incisions. Went on a 45 minute very slow walk to try to work it out, not sure if it helped, but I'm good today.  Took a shower and graduated from PJs to leggings. Not even feeling like I need the pain meds today.  \n\n[Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/47mw34/lap_experience_part_ii/)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My lap experience- detailed and long", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/44dxv5/my_lap_experience_detailed_and_long/"}, {"author": "MadamGreenEyes", "author_created_utc": 1443962749, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_qxj5n", "created_utc": 1454727391, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/44eckj/after_ivf_balance/", "gilded": 0, "id": "44eckj", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/44eckj/after_ivf_balance/", "retrieved_on": 1459161806, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Here's the usual, I'm a long time lurker, first time poster thing.

We just got confirmation a few days ago that we have to do IVF due to MFI. It's a  year now we have been actively TTC with tracking etc, though we were trying before that too. \nA couple months ago, when my husband did his first SA and we got the bad results, I had my depression, crying bouts etc. At the same time, every single person on Facebook was either pregnant or announcing births. Grrrr. I'm feeling better about things now because at least we have a game plan. \n\nBUT that said, two of my close friends just had their babies in the last month. For friend A, I'm really happy for her. She has some health issues and I know it worried her but it was all fine.\n\nHowever, I want to smack friend B. I feel so angry/jealous/resentful to her. She has PCOS and was always convinced she'd never get pregnant without IVF. And constantly would tell people about it. And then when she did (after constantly talking about trying, hilariously announcing at the bar when she had to get home because she was ovulating, etc), she was telling me how it took her forever and that they actively tried for 10 months before it happened. Ugh.\nAnd so, it's been a constant barrage of pregnancy photo shoots on social media, links to articles about pregnancy, etc. You'd swear she was the first person to ever be pregnant. \n\nThen when she had the baby, she sent me a pic but I realized she never announced it on FB and knew she wouldn't post anything without it being \"perfect\". Low and behold, a week later she announces the birth using a professionally done portrait of her and the baby. Perfect hair and makeup. With the usual annoying hashtags \"#can'tbelieveI'mamommy! #somuchfunbeingamommy!\".\n\nMeanwhile, Friend A posts a makeup-free selfie of her, hubby and baby sitting on the couch.

Realized I had to pee and the bathroom at the store was closed. As I was walking back to my car, it started to feel like the worst cramps of my life combined with a serious UTI level need to pee. Home was less than 5 minutes away. I literally stopped the car in the driveway and then walked as slowly as possible inside because walking was extremely painful.\n\nGot to the bathroom and nothing would happen. I then realized something was seriously wrong. I made my husband help me to the shower because at this point even standing up was feeling impossible. I sat under the water for 15 minutes trying to get my muscles to relax. It felt like my whole insides were in one giant knot. We called my mom and she of course told my husband to take me to the emergency room.\n\nTrying to get dressed was absolutely miserable. I was essentially rolling around on the bathroom floor. And of course my husband starts making jokes because he was freaking out and that's his defense mechanism. Laughing was not helpful :p\n\nGot to the emergency room. Got to fill out 5 pages of paperwork because that's reasonable. They took me back and my nurse was asking about my medication. As soon as I said femara, she knew that was the issue. She is a fellow IF sister and went to the same clinic as me. \n\nThey asked me for a urine sample (hah!!) and at this point I was able to give them a little bit. They did an ultrasound and the doctor said my bladder was still completely full and to try one more time. At this point I suppose it had been over an hour and my body finally relaxed enough to go. It was the most glorious pee of my life.\n\nThey gave me a printout showing that this is a femara side effect. Additionally the nurse chatted with me about our clinic, asked what my protocol was so far, and gave me some tips. She said that after 5 medicated cycles, you really should give your body a break. She also warned me about the clinic wanting to push for lesser treatments until you demand it (which is what I'm going to do today at my CD3 appointment since I want to move forward with IUI).\n\nFinally got discharged because my body decided to stop being insane. It was seriously the most unpleasant 2 hours of my life thus far. \n\n**TL;DR** - femara put my body on lockdown so I couldn't pee and it was absolute torture. My husband tries to make me laugh when I am in miserable pain. IF-knowledgeable nurse was very helpful. Fertility drugs do crazy shit to your body.\n\n**Update:** Went to my CD3 baseline appt and my RE said she's never heard of this happening before. She thinks it was just really bad cramps and my period is so different now since I'm actually ovulating. I don't know if I agree - the cramps were horrible, but this was like a totally different level of my entire insides screaming at me. I told her I'm willing to try femara again in hopes that this was a one time incident and I want an IUI this time. She said since I'm ovulating on femara, there's no need for an HCG trigger and that studies with clomid/trigger show that success rates are usually better if you wait for your natural surge.

Please do take all of this with a grain of salt. I'm no expert. My story is that I didn't find the right guy until late in life, and both of us had given up on having children by the time our relationship was ready for them. So when, at 40, I stopped using birth control and got pregnant, we were thrilled. Neither one of us thought this was possible (now we feel a bit silly about that) but we both realized that we wanted a baby and started making plans.\n\nUnfortunately, that pregnancy didn't last long. I miscarried at 5 weeks and went straight to a doctor to discuss options. \n\nMy doctor was very straightforward. At 40 (almost 41) my chances were small. She asked me to do some tests, which showed a high FSH and normal AMH (I don't remember the numbers) and recommended that I go for IVF immediately. When I googled the numbers, I realized that many clinics wouldn't even take someone at my age with my numbers. My doctor was very straightforward in telling me that she could not predict how long I'd have enough ovarian reserve to even try to get pregnant in the future. Hence the need for IVF.\n\nI listened to her and immediately started IVF. As I looked up success rates for women my age (by then 41) I realized my odds were small. Some websites said that less than 10% of women had babies after one round of IVF. I started to regret my decision - why put myself through this if I had such a low chance? \n\nMy doctor also insisted on PGS. Because of my age, she said, the rate of abnormal embryos was likely to be high and she wanted to maximize my chances. After my egg retrieval, where we got 6 eggs, and 5 embryos made it to day 4, I was sure she was wrong and my chances were high. But when these 5 embryos were tested, only 1 was normal. 1!! I again looked up what had happened, wondering if maybe something was wrong with the lab, only to find out that at my age about 80% of embryos are abnormal. So without PGS, I would have randomly implanted 3 of the 5 embryos, and I would have either been lucky and one of those three would have been the normal one, or I would have had another unexplained miscarriage.\n\nI can't tell you the end of the story, because it hasn't yet ended (and I hope the ending is a good one), but what I wanted to say is that I learned a lot from these last few months. First, I learned that it is quite possible to get pregnant after 40, but what is hard it to keep the pregnancy going, given the high rates of chromosomal abnormalities. For me, the most sad part of the process is realizing that you have miscarried, and that the little life you thought you were carrying wasn't meant to be. Because of this, the second thing I learned was that I would do whatever it takes to reduce the chances of miscarriage. This includes PGS and anything else I can think of (no caffeine, no travel, no excessive exercise). I also learned that given how our bodies work, IVF+PGS seems like the best option for anyone over 40. It is expensive and difficult but considering how quickly we stop producing viable eggs after 40, I  don't see any other good options. \n\nIn any case, those are my thoughts. If this round of IVF doesn't work out, I will try again, and would appreciate any advice or thoughts that you all have on this.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some thoughts on infertility treatments after 40", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/44vow7/some_thoughts_on_infertility_treatments_after_40/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1455012154, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/44vzqd/tuesday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "44vzqd", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 250, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/44vzqd/tuesday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1459170179, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.
