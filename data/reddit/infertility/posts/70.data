However I'm trying to figure out whether this is really the best ratio and whether to freeze at day 3 or at day 5. I'll summarize my back story first before more specifically listing my questions, since it's complicated.\n\nHISTORY\n\nI've done 7 prior cycles, have always ended up on 450u total. The first four cycles were when I was 34-36 yrs old. Used OCPs in advance and ganirilex for suppression midway through. The split was 225 menopur/225 bravelle (same as follistim/gonal). Stimmed for 12-14 days, always with VERY slow rise in estrogen initially, but ultimately peak estrogen at 1300-2100. Three cycles produced 14-20 eggs, with around 90% fertilization, 1-4 blasts on day 5. Likely a MFI component due to borderline SA. The fourth only produced 8 eggs with 4/8 fertilizing normally, but we still got two blasts. Nothing was PGS tested, but we two transfers resulted in two losses (9w mc of identical twins, 20w termination for severe neural tube defect). Post-loss testing was normal.\n\nFifth cycle - 36 years old. This was with a new doctor. This time we did OCP before for a couple of weeks, overlapped with lupron which I continued into the cycle, no ganirilex, and only 75 menopur with 375 gonal F. Triggered on day 12. 15 eggs, 90% fertilized, three blasts, 2/3 PGS normal. Transferred both, success with one. Same slow rise of estrogen initially, peaked around 1400. \n\nSixth cycle - 38 years old. No lupron, instead did OCP with ganirilex midway through. Went up to something like 150 menopur, 450 gonal f. This was with a third doctor who freaked with my initial slow rise in estrogen, although it's always been that way. Didn't move things any faster - still triggered Day 13. Collected 10 eggs, 9/10 fertilized, they said the quality looked great. But no blasts on day 5. \n\nSeventh cycle. 38 years old. Dialed back on the stims to mimic my successful fifth cycle, except we did 300u follistim and 150u menopur because the RE said that this was better than 375/75. Did OCP, lupron, and HGH, but didn't start HGH until stim day 5 for some reason. 18 eggs, 17/18 fertilized, quality looked as expected for age, worse than sixth cycle. Had a bunch going on day 3, transferred the three best (including one \"rock star\"), ended up with a singleton pregnancy and miscarriage at 10w, likely due to aneuploidy based on a large yolk sac. \n\nNow going into our eight cycle (sigh). We have several blasts frozen, but I want multiple kids, so I'm trying to make as many embryos when/if we still can.  Also, this time we're testing for DNA frag and using microfluidics for sperm sorting (thanks to u/chulzle!) I don't have high hopes based on our past two cycles, but I'm doing it just so I know we tried everything. Planning for a freeze all and instead will transfer one of our PGS normals.\n\nFIRST QUESTION: \n\nAs I said, my doctor is thinking 300/150 split, but I'm wondering if whether to advocate for 225/225, 375/75, or something else. In general, what's the best combo for a decent responder on high doses with egg quality as expected for age?\n\nSECOND QUESTION: \n\nWould you freeze on Day 3 or Day 5? If you freeze on Day 3, do you freeze the ones that look crappy, too? Or only the good looking ones? We've always had steep losses from Day 3 to Day 5, possibly due to MFI, but maybe microfluidics will change that? We won't know until we try. But my RE and lab director also say that some small percentage of embryos that fail to get to Day 5 would have been successful in utero. So I lean towards freezing on Day 3, but the certainty of Day 5 is also appealing. \n\nThoughts? Other advice? Thanks to anyone who made it through this novella. Y'all are the best. &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 10881, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Advice on IVF protocol?

We've done six medicated cycles, two letrozole cycles that I didn't respond to, but only a few have been monitored. In every single monitored cycle, only my right ovary has had mature follicles. My left ovary never has anything above a 10. Also, they've always had trouble getting a good look at my left because it is set very far back which was also noticed on my HSG tests. So anyway, yesterday at my US the tech straight up couldn't find my letter ovary. Had to have someone else come in. She said I also had a lot of gas which was making it difficult lol. Anyway, they did find it but it was located posterior to the uterus. The probe actually felt like it was slightly on the right hand side. The images they took they took with the probe directly in the middle of my pelvic area or off to the right. So basically it's in the totally wrong spot. Im surprised it was never mentioned during any of my ultrasounds previous to my infertility journey. We had a stillbirth in 2015 and had lots of ultrasounds done but I guess that's not what they were looking at so they probably wouldn't have mentioned it come to think of it. \n\nSo anyway, they also counted the number of follicles I had yesterday (I can't remember the correct term...antrial or something?) I had five on my left ovary, and 13 on my right. My right also has a 17mm cyst (the reason my last cycle was stopped. But it was 25mm at that time). Is that a significant difference? Or do I just have a dominate ovary? My cycles randomly because extremely irregular a couple years ago after being normal my entire life. Sometimes I'd go months without ovulating or getting a period. We are unexplained but I do have hypothyroidism. That is being managed though and my cycles still are the same crazy irregular they were before. I know it's a stretch but could there be something wrong with my left ovary which could explain why I don't ovulate regularly and why the ovary is so much smaller? \n\nAs for the cyst on my right ovary, I almost had this cycle canceled as well. (my first cycle with TI and injectables), but my E2 was 78 so still considered normal range soy RE is letting us proceed cautiously. Last cycle I did take the clomid and estrogen and my cycle wasn't stopped until right before the trigger, and the cyst still shrunk so she's hoping that it'll be ok to continue this cycle if last was anything to base it off of. \n\n\nI just think it's kind of odd that my left ovary is so non responsive compared to my right. I was under the impression that they take turns but that fertility treatments can cause both ovaries to have mature follicles. Any input would be greatly appreciated. I'm probably overthinking things again to be honest.

They will do a 15 min pre-qualification interview. If you pre-qualify, you can get 90 days worth of free omnitrope while the official application is pending. I think it still takes a couple of weeks to get the first dose though.\n\n(2) Fill out the Novartis application [here](https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment). Fill out the patient section yourself and fax it in to the number listed, then have your provider fill out the physician section and fax to the number listed.\n\n(3) Have your provider send your omnitrope prescription to Novartis at the same fax as in #2. \n\n(4) Call 877-456-6794 to talk with Omnisource. They'll ask your doctor to send a statement of medical necessity to them at 877-828-1052. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll update this if/when my application is approved.

At the end of the way, I'll do ANYTHING for it to be a success, but the idea of all the injections, OHSS, pain, and being so far away from America terrifies me.

The whole time we were there, I said maybe 2 words to his family. I really don't think they like me. We've been together almost 9 years and my relationship with them has not gotten any better. Hubby made feel like crap saying things like you're not capable of working and I always have to take care of you. I quit my job recently due to all the pain. We were going to start IVF the end of this month and he said for me to cancel the appt because he doesn't think he wants to have any biological kids with me after how I reacted today to his grandpa's comment.

By medical standards, my husband and I are both considerrd infertile - I have PCOS and he has few and poor swimmers.  To become pregnant, I used clomid (and a lot of patience).  But I also have a balanced translocation, a genetic abnormality which leaves me with approximately 70% chance for miscarriage and has resulted in three miscarriages prior to my rainbow baby.\n\nIn trying to get pregnant has stripped us of the intimacy and passion we once shared for one another.  (Slowly trying to get this back).  And having my miscarriages was a  lonely process.  No one wanted to talk to me about it because it was too difficult to do so, so I was left alone to wallow in my sorrow.  Yet the world moved on around me.  \n\nBut it was all worth it.  My baby girl arrived in August and she is the bestest blessing to ever happen to me.  She is healthy, beautiful, and a happy bundle of joy!  Her birthday was the happiest day in my life. \n\nBut we do want another baby...\n\nSo now I wonder if I should just leave things as are and be grateful for my little one and just enjoy her.  Or should I try again?  If so, should I go to the extent of clomid, ovulation sticks, timed intercourse.  Or maybe to ease the stress, just let things be and only take clomid and hope for the best? Both options still carry the high likelihood of miscarriage.\n\nWould love to hear your opinions on the matter.\n\nConsiderations: if we try again, we would have to do so immediately after I am done breastfeeding  due to our ages and likely duration to achieve a successful pregnancy.  IVF is not an option due to statistical probability and financial constraints.

My main question- Has anyone skipped IUI and gone straight to IVF?\n\nWe don\u2019t have coverage for either and the global rate for IUI at our clinic is 1800 (will probably run us 2k a month after meds). I almost feel like it would be more cost effective to opt into a shared risk program. I\u2019m worried about shelling out 6k and being told to pursue more aggressive treatment and feeling like we could have covered 1/3 of that with that money.\n\nI think I am also hesitant because we have no male factor so I don\u2019t think IUI will increase our changes. We previously had success with clomid and timed intercourse which is where we started this round back in April. I have pcos and no longer responded to clomid but asked to try letrozole. (PCOS has mainly been confirmed through high LH levels that actually decrease as follicles mature) I respond to 7.5 mg with about 2 follicles each time. We had success in the second round back in August but miscarried (this is our second miscarriage). We have now completed 3 rounds all BFN.\n\nWe had a follow up on the 18th in the middle of this last round to talk about switching to IUI from timed intercourse but I think I was caught off guard because I thought he would want us to move onto injectables (which I was going to ask for a combo cycle to save money and hopefully not overstimulate). I have to have a hysterscopy for to check for possible scar tissue as my hsg showed a filling defect but I opted to put off surgery as I\u2019d never been put to sleep before. We will have to take this next month off with that so we have time to talk things through.\n\nSorry I am rambling, but I appreciate any advice/opinions.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 10917, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "IUI vs IVF", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/abj69z/iui_vs_ivf/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "lurkiethelurkest", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "37F, very low AMH, 1st IVF now", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_mex3nd6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1546358911, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/abj9iv/has_anyone_tried_elonva/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "abj9iv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/abj9iv/has_anyone_tried_elonva/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1546358912, "score": 1, "selftext": "Happy new year everyone! \n\n\nSo, as the title says: has anyone tried Elonva?

I\u2019ve got a lot to say here so please bear with me.\n\nI\u2019m 23 and have been trying for a baby for the past 15 months now. My husband was told he had a low sperm count and on top of that, I have poly cystic ovaries. We aren\u2019t sure right now if my tubes are open or blocked - so that could also be causing issues. I\u2019m due a test for that in April. Super far away because I\u2019m in the UK and we only have public health care.\n\nFirst up we have my best friend, who I don\u2019t even want to be friends with anymore. She got off of birth control in October whilst her boyfriend begged her not to because they\u2019re not financially or emotionally stable. They began using condoms, however she magically got pregnant and told me on Christmas Eve. I\u2019m pretty sure there was some foul play regarding the condoms on her part, but I won\u2019t go too much into that.\nWhen my friend announced her pregnancy to her boyfriend, he left their apartment for a week whilst telling her that the reason he had wanted her to stay on birth control was because he wasn\u2019t sure about their future and didn\u2019t know if he wanted this forever. No hard feelings for the dude, he was well within his right to be angry about her pregnancy when he told her several times he didn\u2019t want a kid. He\u2019s since arrived home and they\u2019re in \u2018therapy\u2019 I hope it works out for the baby\u2019s sake, but people like this can fall pregnant and we can\u2019t. We\u2019re a married couple who have been together for 8 years, we own our own home and have good jobs. \n\nNext up, my cousin. Back in April of 2018 he had an affair with a woman from his workplace. Abandoned his son, daughter and wife and 4 days before Christmas announced his new girlfriend (the lady he had an affair with) was pregnant. Less than a year and she\u2019s pregnant. He announced this at a family Christmas party and I felt physically unwell. I stuck it out though and put a brave face on.\n\nThen we have ANOTHER cousin. She is my age and mentally disabled. She isn\u2019t severely disabled but she is disabled to the point that she needs to live in a care home - she can still make her own decisions and such. \nIt was discovered she had gotten pregnant whilst living in this care home for the disabled. Nobody knows who the father is, he isn\u2019t a resident there. She\u2019s perfectly happy about this and is somehow being allowed to keep the baby when it is born.\nI don\u2019t mean to sound like a jerk here - my own little brother is heavily disabled and I\u2019m all for disability rights and fair treatment but again, this situation is unfair.\n\nI feel awful over it all. And I\u2019m allowed to feel awful over it all. This year looks as though it\u2019s going to be just as negative and disappointing as last year. I\u2019ve cried whilst typing this out.

My wife and I have been trying to conceive for 6 months (I know not that long) but I can\u2019t help to feel that something is wrong with me. As a pre-teen I had a hydrocele repair on one of my testicles. At the time I remember the doctor saying it would have no impact on my fertility. Fast forward to my 20\u2019s, a epididymis cyst developed on that same testicle. I had an ultrasound done that confirmed it and I guess the doctor also checked the bloodflow when he sent me for the ultrasound. He said I had good blood flow to the testicle. My wife has normal period so I feel that the issue is with me. I started researching recently and read a few stories about men who had hydrocele repair in the past have blockages now due to scar tissue (azoospermia with 0 sperm). \n\nI mentioned to my doctor when we were about to start trying for a baby if I\u2019d have any issues due to the cyst but she did not seem concerned at all. She just said to come back in a year if my wife was not pregnant by then. \n\nI guess my question is has there been anyone that has conceived naturally after hydrocele repair in the past or is it almost a guarentee there will be zero sperm. I know men with only one testicle have been fertile so that gives me a slight bit of hope since my other testicle seems like it\u2019d be normal. \n\nWould love to hear from anyone who has some insight on this. All these years I believed my surgeon that the surgery would have no effect on fertility so reading recently that some men have had issues has been a bombshell for me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 10922, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Possible infertility issue", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/abqf29/possible_infertility_issue/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1546420091, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/abrr0v/monthly_introduction_thread/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "abrr0v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 32, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/abrr0v/monthly_introduction_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1546420092, "score": 1, "selftext": "Are you new to r/infertility?

I'm wondering if there are different recommendations/ management for chemical pregnancies after fet vs. complete lack of implantation (i.e., no positive beta)? I am particularly concerned because I have recurrent pregnancy loss, and this is the stage where I always seem to fall apart. I'm starting to think this will never work and I'm feeling really, really down today.\n\nA little background on me... I'm 34 and my husband is 38. We had success 4 years ago. We started trying again 2 years ago and I had 2 CP's and 1 MMC within the first year of trying. I did a RPL panel, which identified chronic endometritis (treated successfully with doxy) and elevated, but not clinically significant, anti-cardiolipid levels. We moved on to IVF, thinking PGS testing and the highly controlled environment would be the solution to our problems. We had an egg retrieval resulting in 35 eggs, 30 mature, 22 fertilized normally, 8 day 5 blasts, 5 PGS normal. The embryo we just transferred was graded 5AA. I'm convinced there is something really, really wrong with me that I keep having losses and not even such a healthy embryo could implant in my toxic wasteland of a uterus. \n\nI'm meeting w/ my RE on 1/7.

I even got that from a friend who was trying for a year (bless her baby boy)! \n\nHere\u2019s a quick bio: Im 24 next month,senior in college. TFAB for 1yr 6mo. this Jan. Stepmom of a 4 yr DD. I\u2019ve been with her since she turned 1, i love that nugget, and have been dying to give her a sibling. \nHubby and I are normal weight, super healthy eaters! We\u2019re Kale eating, smoothie chugging, vitamins everyday mofos. I get AF every month, maybe +/- couple days. I drink and smoke weed on the weekends.\n\nI was/am (haven\u2019t gotten called) an approved egg donor. It\u2019s been like a year now, I mention this because the process put me through thorough testing to make sure I\u2019m a healthy, no-risk, ovulating, reg AF candidate. I applied before I was 6mo. trying because I really needed the money at the time.  Fast forward, after I was 6mo trying I went to obgyn. He checked me out, said I was all good-gave me Clomid and Metaformin. I took that duo for 4 months, then quit because I was tired of taking the pills. Then DH got a sperm analysis, the doc said he was\n A-OK, no irregularities. These last couple months have just been us \u201crelaxing\u201d\ud83d\ude44. \n\nTemping was hard, I couldn\u2019t be consistent with it. Im now going to try ovulation kits.. any suggestions? \n\nI also had the craziest dream this morning that I woke up, tested and saw a faaaint line. I went to grab my phone to post it r/tfablineporn , and DH went in and saw a definite positive! We were jumping for joy, I was so excited! I woke up, tested, BFN!

POAS negative throughout on Days 9, 12, and 15, blood test today came back negative and also finally started spotting (period was a few days late) so I ended up with a 32 day cycle. \n\nI had an ultrasound on CD 13 and had two follicles at 20.1 and 21.1 mm after 150mg of Clomid on CD 5-9. We triggered that morning and did the IUI the next morning on CD 14.\n\nSince I had such a long cycle, I'm wondering if it would be beneficial to wait another day or two for follicles to grow to do an IUI? I know they usually consider 18+ to be mature, but I can't help but wonder if I would benefit from another day or so? I know I risk ovulating on my own at that point, but I could do OPKs starting mid-cycle to monitor and let my doctor know if I saw the surge.\n\nThis was my first IUI so I'm trying not to be sad about it, but I can't really help but wonder if I should do something different, particularly given the cost of donor sperm. I've never tried to get pregnant before, and I know I have low AMH because I initially was hoping to freeze eggs instead of TTC solo. My AMH makes me a lousy IVF candidate, but no other known fertility issues and I ovulate on my own. My infertility is mostly social at this point.\n\nThoughts? I don't want to be an annoying patient, but since TTC for me is $2k every time, I want to do everything I can to do it right!

This could explain why, in the SEVEN egg retrievals we've done so far, we lose tons of embryos between days 3 and 5.\n\nMeanwhile, when we first started IVF 4.5 YEARS AGO, both husband and I thought that he had a varicocele (we're MDs). He went to a urologist, who said, nope, no varicocele. In the mean time, we've done seven retrievals with tons of eggs, great fert rates, and huge losses from day 3 to 5. Starting with around 15 eggs, often 90% fert, getting 0-4 blasts each time, with the most two recent being no blasts and 10w m/c of a likely aneuploid embyro, nothing to freeze. We've had four transfers, four pregnancies, three losses (9w mc identical twins, 20w TFMR, and the 10w loss), one success. I've been out of residency for four months because all of my appointments aren't compatible with our schedule, and my program prefers a leave of absence. The last resident who did IVF ultimately dropped out. \n\nBefore today, I was planning to do one last egg retrieval with a freeze all after my HCG drops from this 10w loss, with microfluidics to reduce potential DNA frag and a different HGH protocol. On Day 5, I'd transfer one of our PGS normals at another out of state clinic. as long as that clinic agrees to the uncertain timing for FET. They're discussing it today. If not, I was going to do another Day 3 transfer of one of the new embryos.\n\nNow. looks like we're doing a fucking varicocele repair and the urologist can't fit him in until APRIL. Tack on three months for new sperm, and we're looking at a JULY retrieval. I'm already 38, those seven months are huge. I'm trying to be happy that there's another potential issue to work on, something to explain our issues, but I can't believe the wrench it threw in my plans. I see three options and would appreciate your input:\n\n1) Forget the retrieval for now and start transferring our frozen embryos asap. But I really want a bunch of kids if possible. If I got pregnant, I lose an important window to make more embryos, given that I'm already 38.5. So this seems like a crap option. \n\n2) Continue with the retrieval, freeze my eggs without fertilization, and start transferring our frozen embryos while we wait for sperm, post varicocele repair. Then I'd continue with the PGS transfers asap. This might be the best option, but I have no idea how freezing compromises egg quality.\n\n3) See what the DNA frag testing shows, and if it's not crazy high, do microfluidic sorting to get normal sperm for ICSI and go ahead with the retrieval as planned. I'd still probably transfer a frozen PGS normal during that cycle if that's an option. If not, I might do a day 3 transfer of whatever we get, or skip a month and then do an FET with the PGS normals, though the second option would further delay my return to residency. \n\nCompounding all of this is that I've done 95% of the research, logistics, and physicality of our IF journey. Husband comes to appointments when asked, but has had to be repeatedly prodded to make lifestyle adjustments (e.g., avoid BPA, avoid lots of sweets, no daily beer), despite being healthy in many ways. He's shown little initiative in researching issues related to IF, even when I ask him specifically to look something up. I've told him numerous times that losses from day 3 to day 5 are often MFI related, he says he hasn't seen any evidence to that affect despite never really looking.  I feel like he's slept on his end of the work up.  If it were me, I would have dug deeper and figured out DNA frag testing long ago, and gotten second opinions from other urologists. That's exactly what I DID do for him. But not as quickly as I think he could/should have done it for himself, because I was working up my own issues, doing all of our logistics/insurance, either getting treatment or pregnant (including 30 weeks that went nowhere), not to mention in either med school or residency. I can only do so fucking much, and I really wish he'd done more. He says he trusted the urologist who he saw before, and shouldn't be blamed for this.\n\nSo now, I'm gutted by this wrench in our plans to move forward and by the idea that so much of the 7 retrievals, $80k in spending, three losses, and damage to my career might have been avoided. I'm also feeling so resentful of him right now and how he's let IF be MY thing instead of OUR thing. I guess I eventually have to let that go unless I want it to eat our marriage alive, which I don't, but I don't know how I should feel about it - what's a reasonable balance to expect and what can we do to get there? Normally he's a good partner in many ways. but he does let me handle most of the planning/admin/mental load stuff of our lives in general, and I resent that. Really don't know where to go from here. We've already decided to go to a therapist.

They're owned by generally the same people, so it wasn't a big deal. But the new company did have different insurance. What they didn't realize when I transferred is that the new insurance didn't kick in until a month after I started. So I was left one month without insurance, that's the month I had shingles. Nothing like getting shingles when you are under 40 to make you feel real special. \n\nMy old boss takes FOREVER authorizing COBRA. Wouldn't put me in touch with them. It's almost two months later by the time I can finally start getting my claims reimbursed. \n\nI think that ends there, but nope. Turns out my old provider, who was told the COBRA insurance only lasts a month, decided to keep on insuring me/charging my old company, who then tells me the other day that I owe them $8000.\n\nWhile that's being figured out, I go in today to start my new cycle for egg retrieval. I realize I haven't gotten my meds and I'm not super worried because I know the pharmacy is nearby and can get them for me 24 hours. So I start calling to see what's up. After an unusually long wait, otherwise fantastic pharmacy says my new insurance never authorized them! Thanks for telling us, new insurance! \n\nSo I call my provider to figure it out and oh boy, I got the worst agent. She never introduces herself, first of all, which I wouldn't care about, but now I can't report her. She just starts telling me, really condescendingly, how insurance works. She makes assumptions about my situation. Because I'm new to the provider, she thinks I'm also knew to having infertility, and so tells me all about how to do things I've done 50 times already. She talks for minutes without a break and I'm too nice to interrupt, until I can finally say \"I've been doing this for a year and a half.\" She apologizes, which is something. So I ask, \"when will I get my medications?\" and she starts hedging, telling me that how it's HARD for THEM to fill out prior authorizations, in a tone that implies I should be SORRY for them. SORRY? For your company doing ITS JOB? Why are you not sorry for me, the person who did nothing wrong, and has infertility BTW?

And do surrogate cost estimates include the IVF? Or is that in addition to whatever you pay a surrogate? Ugh. So overwhelmed by all of this. And I\u2019m so discouraged to have to consider this when I just want to focus on getting better.

AMH was 1.58 then and my Vit D was 31 so it was suspected that my AMH was suppressed by the Vit D. All 3 failed and we moved to IVF.\n\nDay 3s before IVF #1:  \nAMH: 0.61 ng/mL  \nFSH: 6.9    \nLH: 5.2  \nE2: 27\n\n4 IVF cycles have confirmed POA (premature ovarian aging) and poor egg quality. Lap was done after IVF #2 and before FET which confirmed stage 1/2 endometriosis which was excised. Did donor sperm with #4 to confirm egg or sperm issues and it was egg.\n\n4 transfers have been done, 3 fresh and 1 frozen. #1 was fresh with 1 day 5 blast. #2 was frozen with 2 blasts. #3 was fresh with 3 days 3s (8c, 8c, 4c). #4 was fresh with 3 day 3s (8c, 4c, 4c,). \n\nSupplements I take: Pre-natal, CoQ10 600mg, DHEA 75mg, Myo-Inositol 1500mg, Vit D3 5000iu, Acai Berry 1500mg  \nMedications: Wellbutrin XL 300mg, Adderall XR 30mg\n\nWorking on #5 right now which is currently planned for March. Protocol changes are being made including 40iu of HGH every day 6 weeks before stim starts and going through until trigger. Doing 300iu Gonal F, 150iu Menopur, and 100mg Clomid CD 3-5. Adding cetrotide later. Triggering with 2 Ovidrel.\n\nDay 4s before IVF #5:  \nAMH: 1.22ng/mL &amp; 1.55ng/mL (it was pulled twice by accident, test results are literally 6 days apart)  \nFSH: 7.9  \nLH: not pulled on CD 3 by accident  \nE2: 68\n\nI am digging hard to find the reasons for implantation failure and why quality is so poor beyond \"It just is for some women.\" Luckily I can boss my RE into ordering me pretty much everything I want to order testing wise so that's exactly what I've been doing. Good news is that my RPL came back perfectly negative and I'm not even remotely pre-diabetic after doing the 2hr glucose test and I'm MTHFR negative. Also finally found a good Vit D supplement that actually raised my levels to 52 (prior supplement I actually dropped in level despite being in spring). Here's some of the the things that I've found concerning with my latest round of bloodwork:\n\n1. ANA titer (Lupus panel 5) was positive, 1:320H Homogeneous pattern (normal is &lt;1:40)\n2. Gastric Parietal Cell Antibody positive at 49 (normal is &lt;25)\n3. Antimyocardial Antibodies was positive, 1:80 Sarcolemmal pattern (normal is &lt;1:40)\n4. Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies are 80 (abnormal is &gt;9iu). TSH is normal 1.71, T4 Free is 1.2. T3 uptake 28%. Thyroglobuline Antibodies squeak in at normal with 1 (abnormal is &gt;1). I have a strong maternal family history of Hashimoto's, so we know that is coming as it did for my mother and aunts and grandmother.\n5. C Reactive Protein slightly elevated at 3.4 H (normal is &lt;3) \n6. Homocysteine slightly elevated at 10.7 (&lt;10.4 is normal)\n7. My hormones are off, androgens are abnormally low as shown below.\n\nThese were done on CD 17 of a 26 day cycle so beginning of mid-luteal.  \nTotal Testosterone: 43 (range is 2 - 45)  \nFree Testosterone: 4.1 (range is 0.2 - 5.0)  \nAndrostenedione: 54 (Mid-Luteal should be 73-184, I fall in the postmenopausal range)  \n17-Hydroxyprogesterone: 67 (Mid-luteal should be 139-431)  \nDHEA-S: 77 (range is 18-391, but CHR called this very low. I had stopped taking DHEA a month prior at last retrieval)\n\nThese were done on CD 4, after the previous results:  \nTotal Testosterone: 16  \nFree Testosterone: 1.4  \nSex Hormone Binding Globulin: 50 (I was told by CHR to expect it to be 90+)\n\nIf you're still with me, you're pretty amazing. Just saying.\n\nA lot of these results fall within indications of inflammation in the body and part of that can be attributed to being heavy. Majority of these point to adrenal and thyroid which could in turn be affecting the androgens and hormones as they are partly responsible for production of them in addition to the ovaries. I know I don't have they symptoms of lupus so I doubt that's it despite the positive titer. My rheumatoid factor was negative so it's not RA too. Possibly just a side effect of inflammation? Also thinking I have a B-12 deficiency because of the GPCAs maybe related to pernicious anemia (but seems unlikely) since I take B-12.\n\nFor physical symptoms I've had (whether related or unrelated): \n\n1. Chronic constipation since 17/18 (like I go once or twice a week). Colonoscopy in 2009 had lesions, but biopsy was benign. Diagnosed with IBS-C and sent on my merry way. I had GERD too, but it just went away without lifestyle change. This runs in my family on both sides.\n2. Extreme difficulty losing weight even under medically supervised plans. I gained 40lbs in one year without changing lifestyle at all. GP and endocrinologist just dismissed it and thought I was lying about eating and exercise habits (I was 19 and loading trucks at UPS for a living in addition to riding horses daily and eating normally). Dieting like cutting carbs and fats exasperates my IBS to where I will go over a week without going or having an urge to go. \n3. Chest pains since I was 11. They are in the left chest and a pulling pain with no shortness of breath. EKGs have all been normal. Not panic attacks and don't happen during them. They last for a few minutes and then go away.\n4. Frequent Tinnitus (at least 4+ times per week that I notice). No headaches to go with it, just the ear rining.\n5. Cold Intolerance forever even though I live in Florida. I keep a heater under my desk and run it pretty much all day (office is set to 74).\n6. Nerve issues, especially sciatica though could be more attributed to horse wreck in 2010. They've continued since even with chiropractic work. I lose feeling in my legs easily and get pins and needles easily. Restless leg syndrome that comes and goes. Muscle relaxers do nothing. Gabapentin is a lifesaver.\n7. ADHD that got significantly worse at 19/20. Not medicated up until that point and didn't have issues that couldn't be handled with techniques (lists, planners, etc) and some self-discipline. ADHD runs in family including my father and my sister and cousins.\n8. Insomnia that started 6 years ago. Regularly get 3-5 hours of sleep which I am completely functional on with full mental acuity (even off Adderall). It can come and go, but mostly here. Trouble falling asleep and if I wake up, trouble going back to sleep. \n9. Depression that was undiagnosed (didn't realize that's what it was) until about 6ish years ago? Infertility sent it spiralling to where therapy wasn't enough anymore. Depression and anxiety both go hand in hand so that's more than likely where it stims from.\n\nNormally I wouldn't go with the whole physical symptoms thing but that seems to be the way that autoimmune issues are diagnosed in addition to bloodwork. I kinda did it the opposite way since I've been ignored by doctors with my concerns for years because of age.\n\nIf anyone has any insights, I'd greatly appreciate it. I've got an appointment with my RE set up for next Friday. Should I look at setting something up with a rheumatologist as well? Or an endocrinologist? As I'm supposed to start HGH on Jan 10th for my March cycle, I'm wondering if this is something I should get handled before the IVF or just before transfer. I'm doing probably 2 cycles of banking at least before transferring.\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 10949, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Minor autoimmune issues causing implantation failure?
