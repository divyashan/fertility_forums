After the first 9 months she insisted we both get ourselves checked out. Come to find out that I had literally no sperm count. Had a testicular biopsy after taking clomid for several weeks and the doc said that its a lack of production issue. \n\nWe are not a family of means that could afford IVF, so we decided to go with a sperm donor. Instead often anonymous one, she opted to use a childhood friend who lives 100 miles away. We did 2 rounds of IUI to no avail. The clinic was required to freeze his sample and then thaw it prior to use which I think made it unusable. So, for the last few months she's been going to see him when she's ovulating and doing a home insemination. \n\nI tagged along on the last time since she has been asking me to go with her. It was super awkward. He went into the restroom and put his sample into a specimen cup she provided and she puts it in a soft cup thing and inside her. \n\nI can't help but feel completely left behind in some ways and inadequate. I know there's other guys who go through this kind of thing, but y'know us guys aren't exactly encouraged to discuss our feelings. She has a tremendous support group of girls she's met online, but I'm really introverted and I guess I just don't know how to talk about these kinds of things. \n\nI feel like the best thing in our relationship would be for her to get pregnant and for us to have a tiny human to focus on instead of what we haven't been able to do. What's most important to me is her happiness. Mine will come when I'm being super silly with the kid.

This is my first marriage. I have no children, but always wanted them and knew my age would probably complicate things.\n\nHusband is 8 years younger than me, but had a varicocele which we knew could impair his fertility too.  I wanted him to get his sperm counts checked, but his *doctor* resisted running the tests for awhile because he was so certain the problem just *had* to be with my age (apparently husband's doctor found his medical license in the back of a cab, but I digress.)  When tests were finally run on H it was determined (surprise, surprise) that he had very poor sperm count due to several varicoceles (a few were hiding I guess).  So we schedule surgery on H and then wait to see if it works (it did, mostly, but that wasted us another 7-8 months).\n\nSo we start trying again and bupkis.  Next stop, IVF--with donor eggs, because I refuse to drop thousands of dollars coaxing H's borderline sperm into my ancient gametes.  H had a harder time coming to terms with decision to use donor eggs than I did.  We drained our savings and accepted a generous loan from my mother-in-law (who wants a grandbaby more than a drowning man wants oxygen at this point) and enrolled in a shared-risk egg donor program at an out-of-state clinic.  \n\nI admit, I thought going straight to donor eggs would be like hitting the \"Easy Button.\"  I was wrong.  We've had our first and then second cycle with frozen DE's cancelled before transfer at this point because our embryos aren't fertilizing or growing.  This time it has absolutely nothing to do with me.  They die before they're even in my body and the eggs have come from two separate, healthy 20-something egg donors.  Doc wants us to try using fresh eggs instead of frozen next time.  Maybe that will help?  At least we're in a money-back shared risk program with 6 cycles to try (glad we paid the extra for that!)  But each failed cycle still represents a lot of painful shots, ultrasounds (the Dildocam ultrasounds are the worst part, I swear--worse than the shots) and, of course, crushed hope.  \n\nSo, here we are, picking a new donor for a third cycle and hoping this one works.

It ended in a presumed ectopic. With the interim three month wait, we decided to travel to Italy as a consolation prize. Then we would start again. Right? Right. Except I loved traveling. I want to do more of it. Non-baby friendly stuff like Africa and Morocco, take the train through Europe, etc. \n\nBut I also really want a baby, I think. I furiously scroll past FB pictures and announcements of friends who are mostly on their second or third kid. A coworker brought her 2 month old in to work for a visit and I had to excuse myself to have a good cry in the bathroom. (Her work baby shower coincided with my initial beta drop, lots of feels there.) \n\nThen my thoughts circle around and I'm wanting to travel again. And feeling like an awful person for crying and whinging over babies and infertility because I know some people who literally want nothing more than to have a baby, and I want so many different things at different times with differing levels of desire. And then the desire to travel gets muddied with some of my fears about the painful IUI process, worries about having a baby that will turn into a healthy adult (my husband and I both have some issues)...\n\nAnd I just feel so lost. For various reasons, I feel like I've wasted the last decade of my life and am now trying to play catch-up. We are lucky in that our fertility issues seem to stem from my husband and not me so there's not a huge time crunch to preserve my waning fertility. But I agonize about being an \"old\" mother. Having my first child at 32? 33? We want two kids, at least. Is that too old? What if we aren't successful with IUI and I am even older? My mother had me at 40 and was dead at 66 -- poor health robbed her of her last years, and I worry about doing the same to any children I have.\n\nI don't even have a question. Just so many worries. Too many moving parts to try to coordinate which inflames my anxiety. It doesn't help that my husband seems as wishy-washy as I am.

On the bright side, I have $3500 to blow...\n\n*************************************************************************************\n\n(Last two paragraphs have questions for the sub... the remainder is just random info/ranting).  \n\nAfter a few years of TTC #1 naturally, then 3-4 months of letrozole, then 3 failed IUIs, my husband (31) and I (35) finally pulled the trigger today on our first round of IVF.  We apparently are \"excellent\" candidates - unexplained infertility, good on egg counts, \"A+++++ sperm\" etc.  We were also \"excellent\" candidates for IUI - and that didn't work out so great.  So we'll see.\n\nTreatment will be at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.  We live in the Twin Cities, so it will be a bit of a haul to get there for all the monitoring appointments, but I really like my doctor and the staff there (aside from the evil nurse with the gigantic speculum).  \n\nMayo doesn't publish pricing for IVF on their website, so I was only able to get it in person today.  For those that our curious, here is the breakdown - \n\n$9,900 package which includes the orientation visit, induction, ultrasounds, retrieval, anesthesia, embryo culture, and embryo transfer.  It doesn't include embryo cryopreservation ($690), oocyte cryopreservation ($1,565), IVF lab services - ($330 for sperm prep), medications (varies), or embryo storage ($400/year).  \n\nWe have a $7000 per person lifetime fertility benefit through our health insurance.  Unfortunately most of the expenses are on my side, and apparently we can't have the husband billed for anything but the sperm collection/transfer.  That said, after the IUIs we've done, I have about $4,000 left of my benefit, and he has $6,100 remaining.  So that's good.\n\nMedications are a bitch.  We have a $3,500 lifetime fertility prescription benefit, but it's administered through CVS / Caremark.  What a complete nightmare that has been today -- just trying to get basic questions answered.  Apparently I need to do the following - \n\n1) Get the prescriptions, and have them faxed to Caremark.\n\n2) Call Caremark, give them all the information that was on the prescriptions.\n\n3) Wait for Caremark to complete a pre-authorization form for each medication, which they send to the physician.\n\n4) Physician completes their pre-authorization form and sends it back.\n\n5) Caremark reviews with a team and decides if they want to approve coverage.\n\n6) If approved, I call to set up a profile with the profile team.\n\n7) The profile team sends me to the pre-authorization team to confirm the medications.\n\n8) The pre-authorization team then sends me to the pharmacy team to discuss the medications and arrange for delivery.  \n\n9) Medications apparently are delivered.  \n\nI have no idea why this many steps are necessary.  It's ridiculous. \n\nAnyways -- In reviewing medication options it looks like the FSH will be the most expensive.  I'm asking my doctor about Brevelle - which was recalled and I'm not sure if it's back on the market, as it's over $1,000 cheaper than Gonal-F, and almost $2,000 cheaper than Follistim.  Any comments on this would be appreciated.  \n\nAny advice from the group on anything related to IVF... \"things I wish I'd known before I started\" sort of thing would be greatly appreciated.

We're not close enough that I could bring it up casually. I just hope if she is trying, she has the decency to wait until I get pregnant before she starts showing. That's not unreasonable to want, is it?\n\nI appreciate everyone who commented on my off-topic rant yesterday. I'm just going through a rough time right now.

No account manager, no benefits.  I've been lied to repeatedly.  They assign it right away.\n* My CVS account manager calls me on 3/25, very apologetic, they're all over it.  BUT it has to go to benefits, who need a prior authorization from my dr.  They've faxed the forms to my dr.  I call my nurse, let her know as a head's up, she says no prob, she'll tell her medical coordinator to look out for them.\n* 3/30 AM my nurse tells me the medical coordinator took care of the prior authorization form on Tuesday (3/29).  3/30 afternoon I get a call from CVS that Menopur and Gonal-F were denied because according to the prior authorization form, I have completed ZERO cycles of Clomid.  Which isn't true, I've completed 3 cycles - 2 with them, 1 with my OB/GYN.  I also had completed 3 cycles of Letrozole.  Med coordinator is a moron and actually wrote \"0.\"  So now I have to appeal.\n* 3/31 I ask my nurse to submit the appeal stating that I've done these cycles.  She says she'll have the medical coordinator do it.\n* 4/1 I check in to make sure it was submitted, and nurse says that medical coordinator can't submit cycles done anywhere other than there (referring to the 1 Clomid cycle) and tells me that insurance doesn't accept Letrozole, only Clomid, because that's what the rejection says.  I call CVS and they tell me they'll totally accept Letrozole, in fact I only need to prove 1 failed cycle of Letrozole in lieu of 3 failed Clomid.  I call my nurse back, tell her this, and she begrudgingly agrees to tell the medical coordinator to just list all of my completed Clomid AND Letrozole cycles so we can just be done with it all.\n* 4/4 I call nurse again, to make sure the appeal was submitted.  She says she thinks the medical coordinator might be out today, and she's out tomorrow, so I should call back Wednesday.\n* 4/5 I call CVS to see if they've gotten anything re: an appeal, nope.\n* 4/6 I try to call my nurse and apparently she took Wednesday off too.  I basically demand an appointment with my nurse the next day so we can just work this all out.  I'm told they can, but also that the medical coordinator apparently did submit an appeal on 4/4, and CVS is still saying they haven't gotten any appeal.\n* 4/7 I meet with my nurse, get a copy of the \"appeal\" that was sent, and it seriously is 100% wrong.  It doesn't mention Menopur or Gonal-F, it actually says I WILL BE taking Clomid, and I WILL BE taking Letrozole, and these drugs need to be approved.  I sit there in my nurse's office while she goes back and forth with the medical coordinator (who I still haven't met or talked to, they keep her behind some magical curtain which is probably a good thing because I may punch her at this point).  Finally after 3 new drafts, the letter accurately reflects 2 Clomid cycles, 3 Letrozole cycles.  I go straight to UPS Store at about 3:30pm and fax that letter along with my own cover page citing the right account info, appeal #, and a letter explaining the error.  I pay $1.50 PER PAGE to fax this shit because UPS Store sucks.  I write URGENT all over the front.  \n* 4/8 (today) I got a call from CVS at 11:30am already telling me the appeal was accepted and I'm FINALLY approved!  I've got to say, I was pretty surprised by the fast turnaround there.  Less than 24 hours!\n\nSo after all that, frankly, CVS only dropped the ball in the beginning with getting my prescription assigned.  Since that point, all issues have been with the medical coordinator at my clinic who is dumb as shit.  I can't believe this is her actual job.\n\nAnyway, as of this moment, I have officially paid for my meds and they are set to be delivered on Tuesday!  FINALLY!  As hellish and frustrating as it was to deal with all this shit, I at least know it was worth it because I was able to get all my meds for less than $600 total.  But the hours I spent on the phone and the anxiety it gave me were not a nice price to pay for those savings.

I put myself together after years of ups and downs of depression. Mike and I came close, more than once, to calling a quits, we didn\u2019t and I would like to believe we are better for it. Picking up all of the pieces of myself has been really hard; I have been in therapy for a few months now. I think I am finally ready to stop therapy, but I am scared of the darkness (depression) to creep back up.  Our five-year anniversary is what is stopping me now. People that I know of that had been married for 5 years and have been trying to conceive were able to get pregnant successfully and have healthy babies, one is pregnant for a second time. It gives me hope, but I don\u2019t want it. I wish I could have a definite answer will I ever be able to get pregnant again or will I not? My counselor would tell me to let it go since I cant control it, and to only focus on what I can. She would tell me to take care of myself and focus on what I can change. Easier said than done but this nagging feeling wont go away.  Why doesn\u2019t this battle get any easier? I feel like I am constantly pretending.\n \nDuring the time I was writing the entry above my husband came in to tell me my sister in law is pregnant! I didn\u2019t know how to feel, it felt like I was going to explode and I didn\u2019t know what to do. A little back story to this\u2026 about 2 months ago My sister in law confided in me that she was struggling to get pregnant and she was having a hard time dealing with it. So I talked to her and gave her a bit of a pep talk. Knowing my history after I have deep talks with another infertile women they miraculously become pregnant within that year. It never fails. Now this time it hit close to home, My sister in law, my husbands brother/ best friend's wife. I can\u2019t avoid this one, I can\u2019t not talk to this women, I have to deal with it. I have to suck this one up and pretend I\u2019m okay, YES \u201cPRETEND\u201d  I\u2019m okay. My counselor tells me that I need to analyze what I am feeling, be mindful of what I am feeling, why, and what can I do about it. So, what am I feeling? I feel broken, I feel lost, hurt, sad, angry, annoyed, alone. Okay, what can I do about it? Well, after I was told She was pregnant, I was quite, in shock and I felt like I was going to explode so I went to the gym.  When I left I cried but I pulled myself together and left. My husband just asked me what I wanted him to do and I couldn\u2019t tell him I don\u2019t know what I need. I just knew I needed to get out. I needed to leave, to move. So I went to the gym at 1:20 am. I worked out until 3am. I called Farah, my best friend and sister. We worked out and talked and now I feel better. I\u2019m ready to put a brave face on. That\u2019s all I can do, \u201cfake it until I make it\u201d. I feel for Mike, he never seems to know what to say. I don\u2019t want to hold him back from anything but I feel like I always do. Tonight I just left him. I went to the gym and didn\u2019t want to talk to him. I\u2019m the infertile one, we had Mike\u2019s sperm checked. So I am the one holding him back from having a child literally. I tell myself it is because he is loves me, but some days I can\u2019t see it. I am trying so hard to stay strong right now but it is so hard. I told Mike earlier that I didn\u2019t want to go to the Easter party at his parents house because Natalia and Matt are going to announce they are having a baby but the look on his face made me feel like I was disappointing him. I really don\u2019t know what to do\u2026. How do I stay strong? How am I going to fake this one? How am I going to make it through? If I feel, if I show him I am hurting, I am going to lose him.

Won't go into this either, but we almost split because I wanted kids and he didn't. We've worked through that and now he's on board obviously. And here he was offering to do this thing he dreaded with all his might. Fuck, I can't believe how far we've come.\n\nHis results look great. It's definitely not him. And for a few hours after we found out, I was so relieved. In some ways I still am. But now we really, really don't have a clear path forward. Everything on my end has been fine except a thin lining (no more clomid, don't worry). \n\nSo now what? We do have options. The RE suggested femara/TI, femara/IUI, or follistim/IUI. But the chances of success for any of these options is daunting and disappointing. Navigating this with my partner's apprehensions about fertility workups/treatments has been tricky. Due partly to the journey that's brought us to this point, it's really important to me that we only proceed with things we're both comfortable doing. I think it will take some more time to get him comfortable with the idea of IUI. And I'm pretty okay with that because I'm also terrified of burning through our options and having nothing left but IVF. I don't see us going there.\n\nI hope this sadness dump doesn't come across as tone deaf. I realize how lucky we are to have options right now. I don't want to seem ungrateful. But as I let 'unexplained' sink in, I just feel completely at a loss.\n\nWe've been together for more than 15 years. We started working through the baby question about 10 years ago. Guys, it took TEN YEARS for us to start trying, TEN YEARS for him to want this. I can't tell you how much of that ten years was spent imagining what starting a family would be like. This wasn't it.
