The sub-spaces allow you to find others that are in the same mental space as you with similar needs and expectations while protecting those that are not in the same mental space, and have different needs at the moment.  We tremendously appreciate when folks receive guiding feedback without the assumption of attack or malice.\n\n**The chat thread is intended for things that are NOT related to treatment**.  Infertility is not forbidden in this thread, but the space is intended to not be directly about treatment, diagnosis, etc.  We carve out this space because many members have made enduring friendships here, but we know not everyone is in the same mental space at any given time.  The chat is intended to be a \"treatment free zone\" for folks to bond and discuss things not related to treatment.  Are you coping with your TWW or COVID wait by taking up a new craft (including infertility cross stitch or coloring)?  Are you overwhelmed with current events and the idea of bringing a child in to it?  Did your idiotic coworker manage to mention their kids YET AGAIN during your weekly team meeting?  Are you moving and trying to decide if you should splurge on that extra bedroom?  Are you frustrated that all the corporate conversations on how to cope during quarantine are focused on \"how to balance your kids and work?\" (It can't be just me)\n\n**The treatment thread is intended for ALLL the things treatment related.**  Got a question about what your protocol means?  Wonder about the side effects of a medication?  Want to share your egg retrieval stats?  Want to commiserate on \"to test, or not to test\"?  Are you trying to understand lab values?  Did you find a new research article indicating sewer water improves implantation?  If it's specific to a protocol, cycle outcome, side effects, medication, etc. - it's treatment.  We removed the \"active\" from the treatment thread quite some time ago.  You do NOT need to be currently cycling or even have a clear diagnoses yet to ask treatment questions.  If you are truly unsure where to post, the daily treatment thread is almost always the safest bet.\n\nIf you post something that you think might be inappropriate or in the wrong place, please do not just add \"mods please remove/delete/fix\".  Your mod team is a group of volunteers that are balancing their own lives, treatment, support needs, AND moderating this community.  Please don't put the burden on us.  If you think it's wrong - reconsider your actions.  Vaguely calling the mods to figure it out for you is not a \"get out of jail free\" card.  Most often when we see this it's an attempt to pass the onus of responsibility to the mod team instead of taking it for yourself.  If you are truly uncertain, you can 1) post in the relevant thread (like treatment) and ask if it could be a good standalone, or 2) message the mods for clarity.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18099, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Treatment vs Chat Threads", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/gw1a8r/treatment_vs_chat_threads/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AtomicDoggett", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "30F/longterm IF and RPL", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13rrxc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591215596, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/gw1rfx/racism_and_fertility_treatments/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gw1rfx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 111, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/gw1rfx/racism_and_fertility_treatments/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "DCj74BDkkVzulrO5U31_N1im359t_1og5mHvV41eaVU", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JTYK0OhBqMuJYOWObPrSiext4IMCSFucVrJpRcZKReM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e14b23ac1f1640b5b37b11bb7a8ab3a3880b6fe3", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JTYK0OhBqMuJYOWObPrSiext4IMCSFucVrJpRcZKReM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28a7fd49311d5b641af9b2fa5a6a5fe5df1527d", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JTYK0OhBqMuJYOWObPrSiext4IMCSFucVrJpRcZKReM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d69878d32b0c0d9cd5f5b7bc72f6f97b1f9bdcc5", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JTYK0OhBqMuJYOWObPrSiext4IMCSFucVrJpRcZKReM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80ec70997a18fa37be5b1f0908154c4183a0e303", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JTYK0OhBqMuJYOWObPrSiext4IMCSFucVrJpRcZKReM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73d977c4ff49b1082a56307fb6889bdb57052576", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JTYK0OhBqMuJYOWObPrSiext4IMCSFucVrJpRcZKReM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d865408914bd8e93da9df45918cb238a6c2119dd", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JTYK0OhBqMuJYOWObPrSiext4IMCSFucVrJpRcZKReM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=653c29c3c25420c81830e4120f590cd49995ff0a", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1591217005, "score": 19, "selftext": "With everything going on in the world right now, I think that this is a good discussion to have.\n\nI am a black woman who has been an infertility patient since 2013. I\u2019ve had 3 different REs and 1 NaPro GYN. I\u2019ve had two cycles of timed intercourse, 3 IUIs, 4 ICSI cycles and 4 FETs. Finally, I\u2019ve an 1 ectopic pregnancy, 2 chemical pregnancies, 2 miscarriages, a missed miscarriage that resulted in a D&amp;C, and most painful of all, the birth and death of my micropreemie son due to cervical insuffiency. I have a clean RPL panel and my only diagnosis (beyond the recent IC and even more recent Ashermans Syndrome because my sons placenta wouldn\u2019t detach) is endometriosis.\n\nI strongly believe that a cornerstone of all of this failure is racism. I\u2019ll never forget one IUI I had was two hours late because a woman and her 4 kids came in after me, but was called back before me. Before anyone asks, no she did not have an appointment because I heard them clearly tell her she was at the wrong branch, but they took her back anyways. Or the time when I miscarried my PGS normal embryo right after seeing the heartbeat, and my RE came in shrieking \u201cwhat did you do?!\u201d The worst case of all of course was my baby boy. I self referred to a high risk clinic, knowing that with my extensive loss and infertility history, things were going to be an uphill battle. My MFM actively saw my cervix change and did NOTHING, even when Iisted off and begged for several common interventions for IC (cerclage, 17p, progesterone suppositories). She smirked at me and told me to come back in 2 weeks, my son was born less than a week later. \n\nSo many of the experiences I have suffered through are backed up by evidence and are experienced by other black women. For instance, on average, [black women tend to have their AMH decline faster than their nonblack counterparts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3857838/). The RE who told me I was young and had time vastly overestimated the time I had; since I\u2019ve started treatments my AMH is less than half the value it was when I did my first cycle of IVF in 2016. Or IC, it\u2019s [well documented](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301211517305481) that black women are at an increased risk for incompetent cervix but my perinatologist didn\u2019t think to explore the adjusted average of occurrence amongst black pregnant women, instead she went with the overall average. Lastly, [black women have the lowest rates of ART success and the highest rates of miscarriage and preterm birth when they do conceive](https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12958-017-0262-5). Even amongst fertile black women, the [maternal and infant mortality rate disparity is an acknowledged health epidemic in the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html).\n\nHas any other patients of color experienced biases or disparities in treatment due to race/ethnicity? Have any of y\u2019all period noticed a difference in the care/outcome of POC in your treatment cycles?

Unfortunately the data has to be mined manually so this is only for the past month.\n\n(1) Overall # of comments\n\n1. The Treatment threads combined saw a total of 5,859 comments and an average of 195.3 per day.\n2. The Chat threads combined saw a total of 3,933 comments and an average of 131.1 per day.\n3. For every 1 comment in the Treatment threads there are 0.74 in the Chat threads.\n\n(2) Splitting the comments based on AM/PM\n\n1. The PM threads combined saw a total of 5,445 comments (Avg: 182).\n2. The AM threads combined saw a total of 4,347 comments (Avg: 145).\n3. On average the difference between AM combined threads and PM combined threads is 36.6 more comments in the PM threads.\n\n(3) Here's where it gets interesting... Deltas and Skew\n\n1. The Treatment threads skews to the PM.  The delta is on average 16.1 more comments in Treatment PM.  As noted above, the Treatment threads see more comments overall though (1.1).\n2. The Chat threads skews to the AM.  The delta is on average 17.8 more comments in the Chat AM.  As noted above, the Chat threads see less comments overall though (1.2).\n3. The skew\\* for Treatment is an average of 0.05 to PM, but the skew to Chat is an average of 0.12 to AM.\n4. This means the Chat threads skew more heavily to the AM, and the Treatment thread skews less heavily to the PM.  Which is also evident by the delta averages (3.1 &amp; 3.2) being similar, but the overall volumes being higher in Treatment (1.1).\n5. If you count threads as just \"were there more in AM or PM?\"  The Treatment threads sees 62% \"PM  days\" and the Chat thread sees 68% \"AM days\"\n\n\\*Skew is the days delta (difference between AM/PM) divided by the total number of comments for the day.  My intent was to consider not just the total variance, but the variance in relation to the overall volume.  9 more comments in one thread on a day that saw 10 comments total is significant (0.9).  9 more comments in one thread on a day that saw 1000 comments total is not significant (0.009).\n\n(4) Other trends and tidbits...\n\n* Treatment sees a distinct Mon-Fri trend.  The lowest volume week days are Sat/Sun (pretty even) and then Thursday which is only slightly lower than the rest of the week.  Tuesday is the peak day of the week on average.\n* Chat has a less distinct trend.  The lowest volume week days are Sun, Fri, and Sat which are all pretty even.  The peak day of the week on average is Thursday.\n* Overall the participation in all threads is increasing over the last month and the most recent 7 days saw an 86% increase over the first 7 days (not entirely surprising).\n\nIf you like tables, graphs, and lots of colors, there is a screenshot of my sheet [here](https://imgur.com/a/J1gFDDY).\n\nSummary:\n\nOne of the challenges of shifting the scheduled post times is they both see different trends.

I need some advice about how to handle my younger sister's fears and anxieties about her fertility. \n\nBackstory: husband and I had secondary fertility issues (repeat losses). TW: finally had recent success. The journey was really hard but I know many have it so much worse. \n\nMy younger sister (early 30s) just got engaged. Her wedding was postponed by a year because of covid19, and she is absolutely freaking out about her fertility as this means a delay in trying to conceive (although this paranoia started months ago, before the pandemic/postponement). \n\nI have tried to be sympathetic - I guess my losses affected her more than I realized? - but I'm losing my patience. She talks about her \\*potential\\* infertility nonstop (almost every phone conversation with me) and I find myself growing more and more frustrated with her. She has no reason (besides having a sister that struggled) to think she will have trouble conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term. I mean, neither did I, but I guess my attitude is why be anxious about a problem you don't yet know you have? Even in my most challenging moments during this  process, I did my best not to let it consume every conversation - and I was actually going through it!\n\nI've tried telling her all this and she yeses me, and then...brings it up again a week later. Her poor fiance is so exhausted by her fears that he told her to freeze her eggs if she's that worried about her fertility, which I don't find helpful though I'm sympathetic with his frustration. \n\nHas anyone here ever experienced something similar with a friend or family member seeming to co-opt their struggle?

I posted this is r/queerception and it was suggested that I try this group instead :)\n\nI'm a 27yo lesbian TTC using frozen donor sperm (my wife is 32yo). I have no known fertility issues and a very high AMH. However, we unsuccessfully attempted 6 rounds of IUI using the same donor each time, so we have now decided to move to IVF with a different frozen donor as the next step.\n\nI started BC on 5/15. Went in for my first ultrasound on 5/28 which showed one stubborn follicle that was large (20mm), so they had me continue taking the pill. Went in for another ultrasound on 6/5 which showed that the follicle got even bigger (25mm) despite the BC. My doc said this one follicle will sabotage my entire cycle if we proceed, so I'm now forced to choose between continuing on BC for an unknown amount of time (could be weeks) or having a last minute \"cyst aspiration\" this Monday on 6/8. I haven't found much info on this, so I would love people's thoughts! Sounds like it's essentially the same procedure as an egg retrieval, but it's aspirating one follicle instead of multiple.\n\nAnother question I have is if others using frozen donor sperm have needed ICSI? From what I've read, that's typically only necessary for sperm with low counts, poor motility, etc. My clinic said I basically have to if I'm using frozen sperm... assuming this is relatively common? It's an additional $1610, so we wanted to make sure it was a major necessity considering the price. Although I know that's not much given the total cost of IVF, and any increased chance is ideal!\n\nLast question: Because of my high AMH, shape/BMI and age, my doc has already said we will not be doing a fresh IVF cycle because she is convinced I will be pretty miserable, I'm relatively high risk for OHSS and that I would potentially need fluid tapped off of my abdomen if we were to go that route. She is very optimistic about how high of an egg yield I will have (although we have not started stim meds or anything) and that my best bet is to wait for a frozen cycle. She had mentioned that frozen cycles have slightly higher success rates nowadays, which has me hopeful. Just curious what experience anyone has with waiting a cycle after the retrieval and starting with FET?\n\nSorry for all the random questions and information. I'm new to the Reddit world, but sincerely appreciate any and all input! Happy to answer any questions that may fill in the blanks, too.

I'm currently going through an early miscarriage and not sure what to do next...\n\nLet me provide some context before I ask my questions:\n\n1. We decided to do IVF ICSI because of issues with my husband and me. We are both in mid-to-late 30s.\n2. Egg Retrieval 1: I took Gonal F 225, Menopur 225 and Letrozole (treatment for 11 days). We got 17 eggs out of which 9 were mature. We ended with 3 embryos which we froze.\n3. Egg retrieval 2: I did a similar protocol with Gonal F 225 (increased to 300 for last 3 days), Menopur 225 (increased to 300 for last 3 days) and Letrozole (treatment for 13 days). We got 14 eggs out of which 9 were mature. We froze 6 embryos.\n4. After pausing for 2 months due to COVID, we did chromosomal testing and 2 out of 9 tested positive. I think it's interesting and weird that all of the embryos ended up being male.\u00a0\n5. We implanted both embryos (the doctor did explain that they were both growing slower)\n6. I got pregnant with low beta HCG in my first test, but the numbers grew quickly so we were more confident:\u00a08dp5dt - 19.14; 10dp5dt - 68.12 and 12dp5dt - 115.80.\n7. I noticed some spotting and cramping so I did another beta hcg test. The level was quite low at 17dp5dt - 159.6.\n8. I went to see the doctor and he checked to make sure it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy, which it isn't. He then warned me that I'm likely having an early miscarriage. When we asked why this could be happening, he mentioned that the embryos might have slow\u00a0mitochondria, but didn't really explain what that means beyond \"it's like having a slow battery\".\n9. It's been a few days now and it's clearly an early miscarriage (though I will do another beta hcg test tomorrow and follow-up with the doctor). It's obviously really upsetting to feel so close and yet be so far from having a baby. Even though I read up on miscarriages, I'm also shocked\u00a0at how painful it is, how long it's lasting (already been a few days) and how much stuff is coming out of me (I told my husband that I'll be a few pounds lighter by the time this is done).\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut I have so many questions...What do I do now? I know I want to try again, but should I start an egg retrieval cycle with my next period or should I wait a\u00a0few cycles?  I'm feeling motivated like I should just get on with it, but my husband thinks we should take some time to regroup and let my body rest. What did you do and why after a miscarriage? What should I do to make sure my miscarriage is \"done\"? How long did it take you before getting your period? Have you heard about slow mitochondria? Do you think changing my protocol will help for the next round? I've been reading about taking HGH (which I don't know much about yet) and trying to improve my egg quality, but would love to read other ideas. Also, have you ever heard of all the embryos being male (or female)? \n\nI know this is getting long but I just want to add that I really appreciate the advice and support I've seen in this group, even as a shy lurker.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18190, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm having an early miscarriage - what happens next?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/gyhpdw/im_having_an_early_miscarriage_what_happens_next/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "soverykeri21", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zd8rp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591570479, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/gymnwx/omnitrope_hgh_issue_help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gymnwx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/gymnwx/omnitrope_hgh_issue_help/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1591570485, "score": 1, "selftext": "I accidentally left my hgh out on the counter for 23 hours.  1 vial was already mixed and the other 2 were still separated (one solution and one powder)... are they still okay?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18192, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Omnitrope (HGH) issue... help!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/gymnwx/omnitrope_hgh_issue_help/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hoarseofcourse", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "35F | PCOS, TFMR | IUI x 5", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_j0n0o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591585763, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/gyqrvd/tfmr_community_for_those_interested/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gyqrvd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/gyqrvd/tfmr_community_for_those_interested/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1591585769, "score": 1, "selftext": "\\[Trigger warning: Mention of previous success\\]\n\nHello,\n\nI am a longtime lurker in this sub, and I apologize if this is against rules, but I wanted to share a sub I created that I hope some of you may find helpful.\n\nI am 35F with PCOS.

I apologize in advance for the length. \n\nBackground: I'm a relatively healthy 31yo female. My husband has had hypogonadism his entire life and cannot produce sperm, so we are using a donor (his brother). We have known about his condition throughout our entire relationship but only formally met with a very young RE last fall to begin this journey and learn about our options.\n\nSince I am fortunate to have always had normal menstrual cycles and I am under 35, my RE suggested we start with a few (3-6) rounds of IUI. My husband and I both liked the idea of starting more \"naturally\" as we knew he was the infertile partner and we want to avoid having multiples. As part of routine testing, in December I had a BAF performed by a different RE in my clinic who counted 11 follicles (6 on one side, 5 on the other). He said this was on the low end of normal but I heard nothing further from my own RE. My Vitamin D was deficient (which has been a problem for me in the past) so I started supplementing in addition to taking a prenatal. My thyroid, lipids, etc. all came back in healthy ranges.\n\nAfter meeting with genetic and fertility counselors over the winter, we asked my brother-in-law to be our sperm donor and he kindly agreed. At my clinic, the 6-month waiting period for donor sperm can be reduced to a 1-week wait for certain directed donors, so long as they have an exam by a urologist and routine semen testing for all donations made within a 7-day period. \\[I'm probably forgetting some details here, but it's legal and we feel *very* lucky we have this option.\\] In summary, this means if we fly my BIL in for a week-long visit, he can theoretically provide 3 samples (spaced a couple of days apart). Assuming they pass muster, a week or so later, they can be thawed for my use.\n\nWe were planning to fly my BIL here in March so that I could possibly have my first IUI in April. In February, I started following this forum more closely and read post after post about the low success rate of IUI, especially with frozen sperm and no medications. This prompted me to ask my RE about using clomid or another drug to up my chances of success. I also brought up the BAF result from 3 months prior which prompted my RE to have my AMH tested. On the same week that I found out our clinic was closing for COVID-19 (cancelling my brother-in-law's trip and first donation window), my RE called to let me know that my AMH was low at 0.68 ng/ml. She was very kind about it, but it obviously wasn't pleasant to learn. She didn't mention that it could be tied to my recent Vitamin D deficiency, so, thank you forum for lifting my spirits on that. She also said that AMH does not mean bad quality eggs or that I am running out fast of my reserve. She said it is one marker but that it's not the \"end-all-be-all\" that it once was thought to be. \n\nEven with this news, she still recommends we start IUI unmedicated to avoid having multiples, though she suggested I have a HSG during the same cycle I plan to start IUI. She also gave me a list of supplements to take (the same ones recommended in \"It Starts with the Egg\"). She agreed to let me use clomid on my first IUI with monitoring, though, if that's the route I feel more comfortable with. She wasn't pressuring me one way or the other.\n\nGiven this information, **what would you do in my situation?** Start IUI unmedicated or start with clomid to increase success rate? \n\nI know I'm preaching to the choir here, but to say I hear my biological clock ticking is an understatement and the delays caused by COVID closing our clinic have only given me more anxiety. My BIL is finally scheduled to visit later this month, so I may be able to have my first IUI in July if his samples pass and are high enough quality. It's unclear how many vials we will be able to use from his visit, but we're hoping for at least 2. (He can only stay for a long weekend given his work schedule.) Once we run out of vials, we have to repeat the process. He can use a sperm bank in his state, but then we will have to wait 6 months for those samples to be cleared before we can use them. This is the route we plan to use long term, assuming we have a successful IUI.\n\nAt our first meeting, my RE explained the various risks of multiples with the different drugs and methods. If I recall correctly, there was about a 10% chance of twins with clomid. She also explained I would need to be monitored while taking it, and if there were a certain number of mature follicles present, they would cancel the IUI and adjust the dosage. I have also read on these forums that many successful pregnancies start as twins early on but quickly transition to singleton pregnancies. I personally feel that the risk is low enough that I would be willing to try IUI with clomid before making the more expensive and invasive jump to IVF. But I also recognize that having twins+ is dangerous and it is not how we envisioned starting our family (though whoever envisioned having infertility?). But given the high expense (money + time) of transporting our donor to our clinic and my new DOR status, I don't want to chance a cycle or two on my OPK and my clinic's timing. \n\nI welcome all feedback and appreciate your perspectives. I'm really struggling with this decision (my husband supports either option) and there's no one with whom I can personally discuss my situation who has this level of understanding.

It also helps tremendously if you upvote the daily threads when you see them so they stay at the top of the sub making them easier for others to find.\n\nThe daily Treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or treatment related questions.  It's a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help.\n\nThe daily Chat threads are for anything and everything not related to treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won't stop asking about when you're having kids? Funny story? Rant? These all go in the Chat thread.

Now I'm doubting whether we should have done ICSI on that egg; we're also questioning our decision on stopping treatment.

We ended up with two embryos at day 5. Fresh transfer resulted in live birth. 2nd transfer this year resulted in a CP. We were trying to do another cycle to bank before the transfer but my ovaries are being quite uncooperative. So, we've been attempting another IVF cycle for a year now. \n\nCurrent stats: 36, AMH ~0.4 (I think, not in my portal and I can't remember anymore). AFC has generally been around 2-4. FSH started last year at ~12 and then just keeps rapidly rising. We were attempting to do estrogen priming and got a dominant follicle and then another time a cyst. Tried again adding a month of testosterone patches and FSH had risen to 18 and my RE didn't want to start with that high of FSH so we scrubbed that. \n\nIntermission of cycling when my gallbladder decided to spit out a stone and land me in the hospital for 4 days with pancreatitis. Got that bugger out and then after the all clear from the surgeon transferred our frozen embryo resulting in a CP. \n\nNext FSH baseline was up to 36. At this point my RE is saying we are probably near out of options for IVF. We did Dr. Sher's Agonist/Antagonist Conversion Protocol. \n\n* We primed for 10 days with OCP, overlapped for 3 days with 10 units of lupron, then just the lupron until my period started. \n\n* 1/2 dose of ganirelix started (and continued until day of trigger) along with 2 mg oral estrace. \n\n* after 7 days we started stims with 225 units of menopur and 225 units of gonal/follistim. I also did 5 days of HGH. I stimmed for 10 days with the gonal/follistim increasing in the last couple of days.\n\n* 3 follicles within the 16-21 window and I triggered with a single Ovidrel. 3 eggs retrieved, all 3 eggs were immature, nothing to fertilize. \n\nMy RE is willing to give this another shot. We're priming with OCP and lupron, then ganirelix and estrace all the same. Plan is to start gonal/folistim at 450 and menopur at 150 this time, and add dexamethasone and 5 days of letrozole. She also wants to use the IM hCG trigger instead of Ovidrel. I wonder if that Ovidrel last cycle is why the eggs didn't mature, she said she didn't think it would be the cause of it though I've seen Dr. Sher's posts about using the 10,000 units of hCG or double Ovidrel in order to mature the eggs fully. \n\nI really want to make sure we're doing all we can for a good cycle here. I'm starting to spot from my last retrieval, so we're likely starting the OCP for priming in the next day or two and then on with this cycle. Anyone else have any input on this type of cycle? What's worked? What hasn't? I'm looking for any arm-chair quarterbacking (doctoring) at this point.

I was diagnosed with low AMH, ranging from .25 to .7, and DOR, and my husband with low morphology.    We decided to try 2-3 rounds of IUI and at most 2 rounds of IVF for financial and emotional reasons, especially as we are not in a state that covers insurance.  The two rounds of IUI were performed at a local clinic, RMA of Michigan, while IVF and Duo-Stim were performed at CNY in Syracuse.  This is also a mini rant on RMA, which I've shared my experienced previously.\n\nI typically have a 25 day cycle and am otherwise in great health.  I have abnormal pain during ultrasound, even with numbing, and especially as my right ovary apparently likes to hide during ovulation.  It's always weird to have the doctor say, \"good girl, you're doing great!\" during an ultrasound.\n\nFirst round of IUI Oct 21, 2019 (third day of cycle): 100mg clomid and 1.2mg bromocriptine.  I was also placed on synthroid 50mcg because my TSH was weirdly high for this month only.  Had two mature follicles and triggered with Ovidrel.  This is when my issues began - for about 3 weeks, I was in pain and cramping.  I could not move without a sharp stabbing pain in my middle and peeing was difficult.  I believe I had OHSS, but every time I mentioned it to a nurse at my local clinic, each of them responded that some pain was normal and it was simply mittelschmerz.  I did not believe I was in danger as I could still pee, yet I spent the majority of the 3 weeks in bed or heavily reclined.  HCG tests are taken about the 2nd day of my shortened cycle and was negative.\n\nSecond round of IUI Nov 16, 2019: exact same protocol, but no synthroid. Had unusually high FSH (jumped from around 9 for the past 2 years to 17).  I asked the doctor if the intense pain and issues I had the previous round could have caused it and he vehemently denied.  Had only one mature follicle, but triggered with Ovidrel again.  Did not have any pain this round, only minor bloating.  HCG tests were negative once again.  \n\n(Rant Portion): Was advised by the doctor that our only option now because of my suddenly high FSH was to proceed with IVF.  I mentioned that CNY was a cheaper option and asked if I could use the clinic for local monitoring; he assured me that RMA did that all the time.  I decided to take a break for the holiday season and started researching cheaper medications; I eventually ordered from IVFmeds, which I believe ships from Israel.  I called in early January to ask RMA of the protocols to schedule the  Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) and  Saline Sonogram (SHG) that CNY required and was told that it would simply be a phone call on the first day of my cycle, similar to a monitoring round and to email or fax the lab orders, which I promptly did.  When my cycle arrived, I called again and scheduled.  The nurse penned me in but said they had never received my lab orders, to which I replied was emailed. I do not believe they check their emails, and the nurse confirmed that they had received the orders.  I called again on a weekend to schedule and was then told for the first time that RMA does not do monitoring for other clinics, and that if I called the number on a weekend again, I would be charged a $25 fee as I was no longer a local patient.  The tests need to be performed on a certain day of my cycle, so this cancellation on a weekend meant that I could not complete the tests before my first round of IVF, thus delaying it another month.  I completed the tests in February, and in March, we drove out to CNY for hopefully my first cycle.  The next day I received a call from CNY stating that they had to close due to COVID, so I am so much more extremely angered by RMA's mismanagement.\n\nFirst round of IVF May 6, 2020: I was placed on a high dosage stim protocol: Gonal-f 450 + menopur 150 iu from 5/7 to 5/14. I was also prescribed a z pak, 5mg prednisone 2x a day, and LDN 4.5mg 1x a day.  I started cetrotide .25mg on 5/12 until 5/14.  Unfortunately, only one follicle was mature, and I triggered with a HCG compound and it was at this point that I learned about duo-stim.  Dr. Kiltz said that usually it was done in for two rounds of IVF to minimize time spent and that there might be some benefits to doing a stim protocol during the luteal phase for poor responders.  I didn't want to waste the one mature follicle I had and asked if it was possible to do an IUI with a duo stim, especially since he stated that he would want to try luteal phase with me anyway for the next IVF round, and he said it was certainly possible since my nature FSH level was so high regardless that the medications shouldn't affect a possible pregnancy.  We decided to go for it.   (As a side note, I started developing a rash over my back on May 19 that we now believe is from a chemical in the compounded HCG trigger.  As I continued with a mini hcg-LH compound for the duo-stim, the rash spread and grew terribly).\n\nSecond round of IVF May 23, 2020 luteal phase duo-stim: When we returned to the clinic for the first day of monitoring 5/27, none of the nurses knew I was on duo-stim.  Most of them had not heard of it and they had to keep consulting the doctors.  My protocol this time was letrozole 10mg 5/23-5/27, Gonal-f 200 + hcg-LH 100 iu/ml 5/23 - 6/3.  Cetrotide .25mg 5/31- 6/3. Still the same LDN and prednisone from previous, no z-pack. There were five possible follicles, 3 on left and 2 on the right, in the early days, but then my right ovary went hiding and the nurses were not able to see it with vaginal or topical ultrasound, so we decided to proceed with the three mature follicles that could be seen. I triggered 6/4 at 8pm with Novidrel and went in for egg retrieval at 6:30am on 6/6.  (Second side note, the rash is now being controlled by hydroxyzine 75mg/day and prednisone 60mg/day and while the nurse believed that it was because of a substance in the HCG compound and that the Novidrel trigger should be fine, she stated that I could take a lupron trigger if I wished.  CNY nurses monitored the situation and called me several times during the day to prepare for this trigger - I was extremely grateful for this kind of care). For the egg retrieval, it was very odd because the nurses and even the doctor performing the procedure asked me if I was doing a fresh transfer, to which I replied, \"I can't possibly do a fresh transfer, since this is a duo stim and the timing would be completely off, right?\"  They had not realized this was a duo stim protocol and placed it in my record.  I was still asked the question after the egg retrieval and was actually assigned progesterone priming instructions for the next few days. This was disconcerting. 2 mature eggs were retrieved, 1 from the left and 1 from the hiding right ovary. Due to CNY policy, if less than 4 eggs are retrieved, then they are frozen on day 3.  \n\nMy next step is to wait for my cycle to start - I am told that it will be approximately a week after the trigger, so possibly tomorrow, and to call with the first day of the cycle.  Then I will start priming and undergoing local monitoring with hopefully a transfer.  As of today, I am still having minor pain in my stomach area, especially after bending at the waist.\n\nFor cost reasons, we went with CNY as it was far cheaper even with hotel costs than to perform IVF at any of the local clinics.  The first time we stayed at Maplewood Suites, but the second time we stayed at the Hilton, which I preferred.  We were able to work remotely at both hotels, which was the only boon from this lockdown period.  \n\nI hope this long-winded post was helpful.\n\nEdit: corrected the menopur dose for first round", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18285, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Low AMH, IUI, IVF, Duo-Stim, and a terrible clinic", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/h0jaup/low_amh_iui_ivf_duostim_and_a_terrible_clinic/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "ovaryacts", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5gfj7ww5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591830045, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1591830245, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/h0mjt2/medicated_or_nonmedicated_iui_when_using_donor/", "gildings": {}, "id": "h0mjt2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 35, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/h0mjt2/medicated_or_nonmedicated_iui_when_using_donor/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1591951974, "score": 9, "selftext": "Hopefully this is allowed as a standalone post. My husband has non-obstructive azoospermia (e.g., he doesn't make sperm), and I have no known reproductive issues (normal blood/hormone panels for my age, have regular cycles and ovulate monthly, although I am of AMA at 35). After consultation with our RE and a reproductive urologist, my husband and I have decided to move forward with donor sperm. We have selected our donor and purchased vials. I would like to begin treatment next month for an IUI, and my RE has left it up to me if I want to do medicated or non-medicated IUI. Our insurance will cover IUIs and ovulation induction (not IVF though).\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this, especially when using frozen donor sperm? I know we have to time things pretty well for it to work given that frozen sperm has a fairly short lifespan. For example, this cycle I used OPKs and they were positive for 1.5 days (and that's pretty typical; I have been tracking my fertility signs for over a year and get all the indications I'm going to ovulate). So according to what my doctor said, I'd come in the day after I get a positive. If I do medicated (most likely with Letrozole/Femara because I have migraines with aura and want to avoid Clomid), would they do a trigger shot too? Ultrasound monitoring? I have searched comment history on a number of subreddits, **but I'd like to really know in women with no-known fertility issues using donor sperm, is it advisable to do a medicated or non-medicated IUI?**\n\nI'm waiting on a callback from my doctor's office to discuss these questions as well, but if anyone else has been in this boat, I'd appreciate hearing your experiences/advice or pointing me toward scientific literature on the subject.

Husband (27) and I have been ttc for over 2 years. Never been on birth control (barrier method), never gotten a positive pregnancy test. Last fall we did blood tests and SA, all normal. At that time I did a medicated cycle with letrozole and hcg trigger. We also did an HSG which was painful on par with my worst cramps but only during the procedure. She got dye to spill. I had a lap done in January by my RE which confirmed stage 2 endometriosis. She did a mixture of excision and ablation. The chromopertubation made my tubes balloon up and she had to use a lot of pressure but got the dye to go through. \nIt seems my tubes closed up a pretty good amount from Sept. to Jan., but RE didn't seem concerned. My pain (thankfully mostly contained to the first few cycle days) came back with next cycle and didn't improve after healing. The 2nd cycle after surgery a cyst prevented us from treatment, and then covid hit. I just finished my first (medicated) IUI which wasn't successful, and I'm trying to decide what's next. As far as I can tell from the cycles (mine are very consistent and predictable) where I chart carefully, I ovulate normally and usually around cd16. That's great news but also means I have had plenty of failed chances which is frustrating. I could do a second IUI. I think my husband is all in for IVF whenever I'm ready. I also think I need another surgery at some point for pain and have consulted with a nook dr. who is willing to operate. I read up and now I'm worried about egg quality even though my AMH was pretty high last year. Is there any other testing I should ask about, like uterus inflammation? \n\nShould also mention we're going to be moving next month and so surgery would have to wait until after we're settled. IUI in the meantime? Nix surgery altogether for now? How long does process of egg retrieval prep/procedure take?\n\nAny advice welcome!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 18285, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Endo and treatment advice needed", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/h0rbyg/endo_and_treatment_advice_needed/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591862839, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/h0uyhe/thursday_am_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "h0uyhe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Daily", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 106, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/h0uyhe/thursday_am_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1591961579, "score": 6, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!
