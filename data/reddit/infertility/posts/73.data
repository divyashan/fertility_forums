I've lost count of how many medicated cycles with TI we've done...12? It's around 12. Last cycle everything was perfect... It seems like I finally found the right dose of gonal f and the right med combination but here we are again waiting for my period to start. So after 12 cycles weve only had one that was picture perfect. We are unexplained, considered secondary because of a stillbirth in the past. I do have Hashimotos and MTHFR. We've had trouble with lining and what I believe might be egg quality issues but that's just my own theory on the egg quality not my RE's. \n\nHere's my question. We are OOP for everything. I dont have a great responce to fertility meds. I have only ever had one mature follice at a time. If we go stright to ivf weve agreed we can afford the testing and blood work and the medication but will need to take a loan out for the ivf procedure itself which is 8,000. We could take a bigger loan and pay a mutlicycle rate of 14,000 but we cant afford anything beyond that and arent willing to take out a bigger loan at this time. So it isnt like we have endless shots at this. I'm not very knowledgable when it comes to ivf yet so stick with me here haha. Im also assuming it's going to take a good bit before the actual ivf process starts. In the mean time my RE has me doing the same medication protocol as last cycle in the hopes that we get another perfect cycle. We can do TI again but would it be worth it to try an IUI? At this point ive avoided it for so long since we are unexplained and the success rates are so low. My husband's SA came back perfect but that was over a year ago. He had an appointment in April wirh a urologist to check on DNA fragmentation. The only way I can see an IUI helping us is that I honest to god don't get fertile cervical mucus. Before our stillbirth I did. Then after it was like my whole body chemestry changed. Mucinex doesnt seem to help. If an IUI will bypass some of the cervical mucus issues then maybe its worth a shot? I was told in the beginning of this journey years ago that I should just save my money and jump straight to IVF by people in this community and I really with I had, but hindsight is 20/20. Our ivf consultation is March 12 and I'm due to get my period any day now. I just don't want to waste money we could use for IVF on IUI if it's pointless. I'm not willing to sit out this cycle though so we'll be paying the monitoring and meds anyway, the only added cost for an IUI is the IUI itself. I guess I just wanted to get someone else's opinion that knows more than I do. \n\nOn a side note, we live in pa which is not an ivf mandate state. Ive done my own research and have not found a single private insurance company that offers ivf coverage. Is this true or is there a way to look this info up easier? My husband's job does not offer ivf coverage but he is changing jobs in the next month and I'm really hoping this new job is going to offer it but I really doubt it. God this whole process is such shit and so nerve wracking. Maybe I'll get a side job at starbucks.

My RE said she does not have a strong preference either way, but she is leaning towards recommending a long lupron agonist protocol for me. My clinic seems to use long lupron protocols more commonly than some of the others I have seen. I have a history of an ectopic, so there a question if I may have some element of silent endo? Because of this, she said she may lean towards the long agonist protocol to \u201ccalm things down\u201d with the lupron exposure (although I can find no data to support this). Otherwise, I have unexplained infertility with AFH 3.5, AFC ~25. \n\nHowever, I am a little concerned about the longer protocol because this will involve taking lupron injections during a time period when I would have to be on call for work 24 hrs/day for 2 weeks vs a short antagonist protocol where I can do stims only over my 2 week vacation from work. \n\nAfter spending a ridiculous amount of time reading about the differences between the two, this systematic review from 2017 seems to be the most comprehensive/updated literature I have found comparing the two:\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/5/560/3965313\n\nIt suggests that:\n\n1)GnRH antagonist protocols have lower OHSS rates than long agonist. Lowers absolute risk of OHSS by 2.5 %. (But I\u2019m not particularly concerned about this since I don\u2019t have PCOS?)\n\n2)GnRH antagonists are associated with lower ongoing pregnancy rates when compared to long protocol agonists. \u201cAntagonist treatment prevents one case of OHSS in 40 patients but results in one less ongoing pregnancy out of every 28 women treated\u201d \n\nTo me, the difference in pregnancy rates seem clinically significant, but I have not seen this discussed in detail on this board before and short antagonist protocols seem much more popular. \n\nMy question for the ladies on this board...Why did your you/your RE choose to go with antagonist protocol over long lupron agonist? \nTo me, it seems like long protocol gives the highest chance of pregnancy success for patients not at high risk of OHSS, but this does not appear to be the most popular protocol for first time IVF from my reading on this board. Is this merely because of convenience ?\n\nI think I am leaning towards the long protocol even if it involves way more injections and is not friendly to my work schedule. I think I would value higher potentially pregnancy rates above all but would really appreciate any thoughts from anyone who has made a similar choice/done either or both protocols! \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11746, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Choosing between GnRH antagonist and long agonist (lupron) protocol", "updated_utc": 1553964923, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/awjpsw/choosing_between_gnrh_antagonist_and_long_agonist/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551546389, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/awjs8b/saturday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "awjs8b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 154, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/awjs8b/saturday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1551546390, "score": 22, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything NOT necessarily related to infertility or treatment.

I had tried clomid and IUI, both resulted first trimester miscarriages. I got pregnant naturally last year but resulted in two early miscarriages again. So 4 totally. I consulted with a clinic and my doctor said I might have 0-2 chromosomes normal eggs per cycle. He recommended 2-3 cycles for banking the eggs for chromosome testing. The cost for 3 cycles including medication can be 65-80 K, which is huge to my family. The reason I consulted at this clinic is that they could do chromosomes screening. The doctor also said the quality of the eggs is unpredictable before the screening. I literally spent my whole night yesterday on counting possibilities of one normal embryo. One one hand, I think I should be grateful that I have a kid. On the other hand, I feel like it would be so great if it works out.

I am a fairly private person and wouldn't label myself a sharer or anything like that, so to talk to people about this is very difficult. And when I do, either I get the flippant 'it'll happen when it happens' response or 'jokes' to lessen the discomfort of the conversation.   And I feel myself buying into the jokes simply to make the other person feel better about my pain. Ugh!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've been trying since 2014, when I went off birth control pills. It was more of a 'hey let's not put pressure on ourselves and let it happen.' Well, a year went by and it didn't happen. Then two... and then three. Finally, I went to the doctor and he told me I'm not ovulating and my progesterone levels are too low. This was when he recommended a fertility specialist. And I flipped my shit, spent the next three years taking a break from anything related to babies or children (as much as I could.) I was angry. Everyone around me sneezed and out popped their fiftieth kid, it felt like. And here I was, financially stable, owned a house, was ready and planning how to do this. And it wasn't happening! Not only that, but the questions came about when we were going to hear the pitter patter of feet. Not once or twice, but several times from the same person or people that had no business talking to me about what was happening in my vagina. The pressure to produce offspring was unbelievable and knowing I was having trouble was making everything worse. Suffice it to say, I was depressed for a very long time, and unwilling to talk about it with anyone, not even my spouse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now and I am in my second month of this fertility business. I did the whole round of tests the first month, enough blood tests to leave track marks on my arm, poked and prodded, round one of Letrozole. The HSG was the worst test ever. Bad enough that I screamed at the doctor that I was done and he could leave the damn room, with the speculum still inside me. Whoops. That wasn't my finest hour.  It revealed that one tube was fine and dandy and the other that caused me pain was 'probably' fine. They couldn't get a good picture because they had to force the fluid into me and by the time they did, I moved I guess from the pain and it spilled out too quickly to get an image. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis month, I requested an IUI. I was done 'trying at it on my own' even with fertility pills. I am 33 and don't want to be doing this for years and years with no results. I am naturally anxious, depressed and stressed out by nature and I can't deal with the anxiety of having to time the sex and find time for sex every day to every other day around the fertile period. I feel like I am spinning my wheels. So, did the trigger shot Wednesday and the IUI was done yesterday and now I am in the waiting game. I am not positive about the results, since this has been a constant in my mind for five plus years.  I don't want to be hopeful, like people tell me to be. I want to be realistic. And the reality is the chance is so low to conceive, but better than if I were to do it on my own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, that is where I am now and this is me.

Came back with **low AMH, low motility and count** (but he said he wasn't that concerned about his numbers?), **ERA receptive**, **day 5 NK cells 12%**, **still waiting on DNA Frag test results.**\n\nDue to the low AMH he's recommending an aggressive over 40 treatment because I told him I do not want to waste time with something that might not work. I also expressed my concern with my husband's low numbers but he said he's not that worried. He's willing to do ICSI with PGS just because I requested it but kind laughed at me when I mentioned the Zymot and said it wasn't really proven yet. Basically told me to trust him and his experience and stop googling things.\n\nHe's the only RE and infertility clinic in our area, the closest next one is at least 2 hours away and it would be difficult to make that work due to my work schedule.\n\n**Here's the treatment calendar he will have me on, maybe someone that has had a similar protocol can chime in and tell me what to expect?

Long time lurker here, first time posting. I am 39 years old and am approaching 2 years TTC #2 with one MC and one CP in my first few cycles.  I have zero fertility coverage and a hefty deductible so I have been doing the usual (temping/opks/tracking) with no medical assistance.  After a frustrating year of regular, ovulating, and well timed sex cycles I finally had a chat with a new OB.  Looking back I wish I went sooner but I get anxious and clam up when speaking with doctors.  This doc was great and spent a lot of time asking questions and offering insight.  She brought up clomid as an option and sent me for CD 3 labs (she also made sure to code it to something not fertility related because she is aware of my garbage insurance!) I was feeling a little more positive since some action was happening and there is a plan in place.\n\nHad the blood work done a few weeks later and I missed Dr's call to discuss the results. Called back and a nurse read me the results without any notes from the doctor or any further treatment options/tests. She did mention my fsh was a little high but inconclusive if it's causing infertility.  I mentioned the clomid and was told if the doctor wants to prescribe it she will contact me. This was a little disappointing because several of my friends (late 30s/40s) seem to have it thrown at them like candy. Anyhoo... here are the results I received:(which were better than I expected)\n\nEstradiol 43\nFsh  11.4\nAMH 3.4\n \nThe following day I got another call from the office (and my hopes up) but it was the nurse again asking to confirm that I went on cycle day 3 for the test.(I did) The doctor left instructions that an SA was the next step and she is mailing a script for him.  \n\nDoes anyone have any opinions or insight on my results? I'm going to try and reach the doctor this week about the labs and if I'm brave I'll ask about the clomid again. Maybe I'm not a good candidate for it?\n\nThanks for reading!

We're based just oustide Dublin, Ireland.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is planning to carry our future offspring. We first went to an appointment in May 2017. Since then she's had all the usual tests (AMH, full bloods, ultrasound). The scan showed a potential band or fibre in her uterus, so she had a hysteroscopy to check that out (it was fine) and check patency of her ovarian tubes (also seemed fine). We have donor sperm from the European Sperm Bank stored at our clinic.\n\nThis process took a few months (and much money) and we attempted our first medicated IUI cycle in November. This was cancelled due to lack of ovarian response to the meds. We've then proceeded with two IUI cycles since January of this year, both of which were negative. Having done the maths (we have one more straw of donor sperm left), we are now opting to try a round of IVF. Hopefully this will generate sufficient eggs for potential fertilization so even if the cycle is negative we can store them and hopefully maximise the sperm we already have to get more than one cycle. Until now, everyone has been all, \"this will work so quick, it's just that you don't have a male partner\".

We are always glad to see members graduate, and to welcome new users in to the fold. However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.\n\nIf you haven't already, please read our sidebar and/or the sticky post listing our rules. If you're on mobile you can find this under \"About Community\" at the top of the page (look for the three dots in the upper right corner).\n\nMention of pregnancy or positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread. Vague and sensitive mentions to \"success\" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies \"I had success with A,B,C\"). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.\n\nSecondary infertility and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses \"blessed\", \"miraculously,\" \"easily conceived\", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.\n\nBe kind to one another. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.\n\nThis is a science-minded, realistic, and sometimes cynical sub. There are many communities online for people who want a more \"positive\" or \"upbeat\" experience complete with baby du$t.  People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic, and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies/cures as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).\n\nSex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. Infertility isn't cute, and neither are the terms we use. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.\n\nNo solicitations will be allowed for monetary or medication donations. To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed.\n\nIf you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button. The \"report\" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment. This will help us to actively moderate this community and makes it easier to catch posts or comments that break our rules.\n\nAs always, we are so proud to moderate this amazing community of strong, diverse and compassionate women (and men).

First we tried for about one year the natural way, then our first clinic had us waste a year between examinations and trigger shots, then we tried ICSI, twice, first in Germany, then in Austria (we've been travelling a lot for work related reasons) and we are still childless. At the moment we have four frozen embryos in Austria, which were described to us as \"good quality\".\n\nMy wife and I just moved to Finland. I contacted a clinic in Helsinki, and they told me that in Finland they only transfer one embryo at a time, maximum two in rare cases. Now, I know some places are far less restrictive about transferring multiple embryos than others, and I am now seriously considering looking for alternatives in other countries.\n\nI'll be honest: I'm at the point where I am losing my patience. It's been five fucking years of grief, five years with a dark cloud constantly blocking out the sun. It's getting so bad some nights I have trouble falling asleep as I can practically *hear* the sand trickling down the hourglass of time: my wife is turning thirty this year, every new month our chances of success are slightly lower than the previous, and though she is still young now, when I think of how quickly these past five years went by, I do not want to waste any more of our time playing an ultra-cautious game which so far has yielded nothing but tears, with the risk of finding ourselves in five years from now still childless, and with significantly lower chances of success. \n\nI get it, the ideal solution would be to keep trying with single embryo transfer. Thing is, we don't have the money to do an embryo transfer every couple of months, and given our history of failed attempts, we may not have the time to do an embryo transfer a year. \n\nIf multiple transfer is so horrible, then why do some places do it?\n\nAll that said, I absolutely 100% do not want my wife to take any unnecessary risks, unless she pushes for it herself.\n\nFuck.

I've been in the background with a different account for awhile since we've been going through this and this community has been wonderful while I support my wife and myself through this crazy part of life...\n\nMy wife and I started trying over 3 years ago with no success.  After going through a year of treatments after I was diagnosed with azoospermia, and a failed TESE we went to donor sperm.  It kills me that we're here because of me and that because of my infertility it's my wife who has to get poked and prodded by doctor after doctor. But she has been so supportive and reminds me that we're in this together.  She's incredible.  \n\nAfter 3 failed IUIs we finally had success on the 4th medicated one in January.  Then this past weekend on what should have been 10 weeks our hearts were torn open as she miscarried. It was a missed miscarriage, we'd actually lost it 4 weeks ago according to the doctor... 4 weeks of more dreams and counting down. 4 weeks of planning. ....  This all hurts so much but I am hoping some of you can help me help my wife.  I've got the emotional pain to deal with but she has that and the physical to deal with and I want to be able to support her the best I can through this. We've talked, we've cried.  I just want to be the best husband possible through this.  Help her through the comments she keeps bringing up, that we got from the doctors who don't know our struggles, like \"you guys got pregnant! That's a great sign!\" Or \"my wife had 4 miscarriages before our first\" To being put next to a newborn brought into the ER while it all started, to the fact that her mother is away with work until October. What are things I can do for her? How can I make this pain bearable? I feel so useless and I feel so incredibly sad and angry.

I\u2019d also just been invited to her baby shower and was fretting on whether I should go. \n\nWell, I didn\u2019t attend. And I have zero regrets. What\u2019s slightly creepy is my SIL was immediately informed by the hostess I declined my invitation (by polite email.) I\u2019m not sure if this was standard practice or more of a \u201comg your sister in law isn\u2019t coming!\u201d I\u2019ll never know and I don\u2019t really care. I discovered this tidbit via my spouse who was told by his mother. Here\u2019s the kicker: neither she or my sister in law had any clue why I declined. Further, my MIL told my spouse that my SIL thought I was mad at her at the birthday dinner we had to suffer. Why? I sat on the end of the table and said very little to ANYONE, but my sister in law decides it has to be about her? Bullshit. She knew what was up, but to frame it as being \u201cmad\u201d at her was so juvenile. It made me realize these people are completely self centric with little regard, and after my spouse told me this, I had no remorse for not attending whatsoever. My MIL also asked if we were \u201cgoing to do IVF again\u201d as casually as you ask to pass the salt. Zero conception of what it actually means to \u201cdo IVF again\u201d and the physical and emotional demand it causes. My spouse told her we are no longer discussing our private life. As a personal chuckle, I never received a thank you card for the shower gift I sent in my absence. Just more evidence to look out for myself and my own well being. \n\nShe\u2019s having a C section tomorrow, which is a bit schadenfreude for me if I\u2019m honest. Of course I wish no harm, but it\u2019s a tad funny she spent her entire pregnancy in tip top shape to aid during \u201cvaginal delivery.\u201d As if that\u2019s even a guarantee! Still, it\u2019s kind of funny that her \u201cplan\u201d went to complete waste. \n\nThings are getting sticky with my spouse. He told me he would like a relationship with this child because otherwise he doesn\u2019t think he can cope not being a father. Great. First, we were in agreement that IVF was not what either of us wanted to do again. Second, we were a unified front that we weren\u2019t going to allow upset in our lives with this new child. But now, both of these commitments are totally erased with his single statement. I couldn\u2019t feel more terrible. And slightly abandoned, if I\u2019m honest. He actually asked me \u201cfor an update on your feelings\u201d and if I would \u201cfeel this way forever.\u201d Let\u2019s just say that wasn\u2019t well received. I told him I don\u2019t subscribe to whatever standard he\u2019s set for how he thinks I should be feeling about things by now, and that I\u2019m not conforming to suit anyone\u2019s feelings but my own, including his. I also told him he doesn\u2019t get to have it both ways; he doesn\u2019t get to ask me to go through IVF and then quasi-complain  how it has shaped me now as a result. It\u2019s also possible to not be certain about wanting a baby AND be sad and angry that you lost one. \n\nSo these new developments are complicated. Tomorrow everything is going to change. That baby will be born, and I have no interest in participating in the event. Thankfully, we can\u2019t immediately, because SIL mandated some vaccines in order to see baby that my spouse and I never got around to getting. Him because he\u2019s lazy and me because no thanks, not interested. And I really have no idea what this means for my marriage in the long term, because I don\u2019t see my feelings changing any time soon and my husband has now shifted favor to the new baby. I honestly don\u2019t see how this can end well. \n\nLastly, I\u2019m fairly certain my MIL has tried to manipulate my presence on certain occasions where the baby will also be present. MIL and FIL are paying for an obligatory family trip this summer for a wedding, and she withheld that SIL and baby would be on the flight and seated in the same aisle as me on the plane. She also withheld that we are all staying in a family villa, including SIL and baby. I only discovered this brought the reservation information. I went ballistic to my spouse about this who promised to insist on separate quarters for us- surprise surprise, he has said nothing yet. I am NOT attending otherwise and give zero fucks how much of a loss they incur. My spouse and I couldn\u2019t otherwise afford this trip, and as far as I\u2019m concerned we were not fully informed when we consented. \n\nSorry for the discordant post, but my thoughts are all over the place. I\u2019m awake with anxiety knowing I\u2019m going to get a fucking baby photo text tomorrow and it\u2019s going to destroy me. On the plus side I\u2019ve started actively searching for a therapist, cut drinking to one weekend a month, and have been exercising regularly. It\u2019s helped slightly. \n\nTL;DR Didn\u2019t go to baby shower. SIL gives birth tomorrow. I\u2019ve been shanghaied by MIL to be held hostage on a trip with SIL and baby. Spouse seems to be shifting allegiance to his family and needs the new baby \u201cto cope.\u201d I sense impending doom for my marriage and future.

I wanted to get on with it because I was nervous about the possibility of infertility (no reason, just had a feeling) and he was not ready to even talk about it. I went off of HBC January of 2018 and by my annual appointment in June I had had 2 periods. I was charting bbt and cm and knew I wasn\u2019t ovulating at all so I scheduled a follow up. She wanted to do a few tests just to see what was going on, my thyroid was slightly low so I figured that had to be it. I went in for an ultrasound and to go over bloodwork results, thinking we would talk about my thyroid and then everything would be fine. NOPE. She walks in and says, as f she already knew, \u201cyep, looks like you do have pcos\u201d and then started explaining to me how ovulation works and how mine isn\u2019t working and ways I can \u201cstill get pregnant.\u201d That was a weird phrase for me because we were not trying at that point. I kind of felt like I was cheating on my husband by talking to a doctor about getting pregnant when he wasn\u2019t onboard yet. I cried the whole way home, and the rest of the day. When he got home I made him watch a YouTube video explaining PCOS so I didn\u2019t have to do it. He was instantly supportive and ready to do whatever we needed to start trying for a baby. So here we are. We were supposed to have our first medicated cycle last month but had to cancel it because of thyroid wonky-ness. Waiting for follow up blood work results this week to see when we can start. I have to take provera to have a period so we\u2019ll start whenever they tell me I am good to go. \n\nTL;DR \n10/2019 PCOS (lean type) diagnosis\n02/2019 Cancelled medicated cycle\n03/2019 hoping for an actual attempt this month", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11797, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Realized I have been lurking/posting without introducing myself:", "updated_utc": 1554019502, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/axzjz6/realized_i_have_been_lurkingposting_without/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551891997, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ay1535/wednesday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ay1535", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 203, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ay1535/wednesday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1551891999, "score": 29, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything NOT necessarily related to infertility or treatment.

My husband's first results were really bad, and we're waiting on the second set of results to see if it was a fluke or not. Aside from low progesterone, which I've been taking supplements for for over a year now, they haven't found anything else. I'm going to have an HSG in two weeks. Right now I'm hoping they will find a way for us to conceive naturally or suggest IUI, since we are not open to IVF. \n\nI'm so glad I found this sub. No cutesiness and no one telling me NaPro will fix everything (I have a lot of Catholic friends). It's been so hard dealing with this alone as everyone around me pops out their 4th child and my mother tells me that it's my fault for being stressed out and \"driving my husband crazy\" and taking Zoloft years ago.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11801, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introducing myself", "updated_utc": 1554025441, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ay5bg3/introducing_myself/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "dsjny87", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3au29ekg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551921699, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ay6r3o/31zero_eggs_a_big_ass_fibroid/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ay6r3o", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1939cb0e-1524-11e9-a01e-0e1796ff099a", "link_flair_text": "TW: Miscarriage/Loss", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ay6r3o/31zero_eggs_a_big_ass_fibroid/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1551921700, "score": 13, "selftext": "Hey everyone! \n\nI\u2019m 31 years old and I recently visited a cool clinic in the NYC area to see if I was a good candidate for egg freezing...\n\nsome history \n*diagnosed with premature ovarian failure at 22 \n*survived 5 miscarriages, twice with twins \n*only had 3 menstrual cycles in the last 8 years\n* FSH &amp; LH through the roof \n\nSo, I paid my fee for my fertility assessment after getting excited about my cycle returning for two months in a row (I was so pathetic in the store trying to buy pads and tampons)! I went to my assessment and verbally gave the doctor my history. She was great. So transparent, basically letting me know my chances of being able to freeze my eggs probably weren\u2019t good, and I\u2019d be better off seeking the help of donor eggs or adoption...RESPECT\n\nThe doctor referred me to a high risk obstetrician who will be able to do some testing to find out why my body is failing me. However, they completed my assessment which included blood work (FSH, LH, AMH) and a vaginal ultrasound. I have yet to receive my blood test results, but I was told that I have no eggs in my left ovary, POSSIBLY one single solitary egg in my right ovary &amp; a big ass fibroid on the back of my uterus. \n\nI was quoted pricing for egg donation, fertilization, medication, the whole nine...which I can\u2019t afford and I\u2019m not interested in until I find out if I can even carry a pregnancy. My feelings about egg donation are an entire essay of emotional word vomit. \n\nBasically, is there anyone out there with a similar story or any advice, encouragement, anything?! It\u2019s hard talking to people about this because they give me the whole \u201cmy cousin was told she couldn\u2019t have kids, and now she has four.\u201d Ok, great.

My husband (42) and I (38) have been trying to conceive for two years. We've had one early loss at 5 weeks in 06/18.\n\nHe has low normal morphology but otherwise normal SA. \n\nUp until recently I had all normal test results, patent fallopian tubes, normal FSH, etc. However, last week I found out my AMH is 0.03 ng/ml. There's no history of early menopause on my Mum's side, though we don't know the history on Mr Dad's side as he has no living female relatives. Amazingly enough his mother didn't discuss her reproductive history with him before she became ill with Alzheimer's. Who'd've thunk it right. \n\nBeginning in September 18 we did 3 cycles of letrozole, but all three cycles ended up being &lt;21 days. That's when my obgyn finally referred me to an RE. \n\nThe RE said that either the letrozole shortened my luteal phase, or I'm not ovulating. I suspect it's the latter as I have only had cycles &lt;21 days or &gt;38 since July 18.\n\nMy RE has told me that if I want to do IVF I have to do it this year, and it will cost 15k CAD. Unfortunately I've just gone back to school for nursing so we really don't have the money. Plus she won't register me until they do a ultrasound. \n\nFor now we've decided to do some cycles with letrozole and progesterone. I'll have to check if I'm ovulating with a blood test on cd 24. If I don't they'll up the letrozole twice then after the third cycle I'll have to see my RE to follow up. \n\nThankfully my research has shown that while AMH levels are correlated with time to menopause and response to fertility treatment, they're not correlated with effective time to pregnancy. That's something at least! \n\nI was handling this pretty well imo until I found at last night that a friend is pregnant. She's due in September, and she got married this January. I feel for her because she vacationed in zika territory before she found out about the pregnancy, which was unplanned. However, it's kind of sent me for a loop. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone here also has super low AMH, and how things have worked for you. \n\nI am so thankful this community exists, I don't know anyone else who has had these issues who's still trying. My younger sister also has infertility issues, but her and her husband decided several years ago to be childfree, so she's of limited support. I'm sorry this isn't quite as full of jokes as I'd originally intended, it's been a long day. \n\nAlso if you got this far you deserve a cookie lol", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11799, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction", "updated_utc": 1554027304, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ay75mb/introduction/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551951201, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ayast5/pros_and_cons/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ayast5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ayast5/pros_and_cons/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1551951202, "score": 6, "selftext": "When dealing with infertility it can be easy to get overwhelmed with bad news and grief.

Quick introduction: I'm 26, been trying for a year to get pregnant. I went to the doctor two months ago- FSH was 9.5, AMH was 3.0. Forgot what estradiol was but it wasn't low and it wasn't high to suppress FSH. Thyroid was all normal. This was on CD4. Naturally, I was slightly concerned about this FSH. Luckily I was already at a reproductive endo (family friend) instead of an OB. She had recently cowritten a study that said that under FSH of 15 and under 30, women generally have similar fertility outcomes, so she wasn't worried. \n\nHowever, I get nervous a lot. Ever since I found out my FSH been having random hot spells, something I've never had before except right around my period. I don't know if it's anxiety. Got my FSH tested again a month later and it was 7.5. I\"m having general anxiety about it being too high, and want to test it every month. But my RE refuses to and says she's not concerned unless it goes around 12/13, which it's not. She also says AMH is more reliable bc it's more stable. Next I'm doing an AFC and ultrasound, to see why we haven't conceived, along with my husband's sperm analysis. Question: My RE is one of the best in the field, and she just recently wrote this article along with several other RE, and she said she's not worried, but I heard that your worst FSH is what they should consider, and I'm terrified it's going to go up higher and higher. Am I just acting crazy, especially since I'm getting these horrible hot flashes for the past few months.

He wants to wait a couple more years, and that's fine. But some of the fundamental stuff should start now (getting healthier, losing weight, physicals/bloodwork, etc.) But I have this nagging feeling that we will encounter fertility issues. Here's why:\n\n* His small testicle size. I can't find any helpful resources online as a guide though. I'm just using memory as a source.\n* He had an u/s done 10+ years ago because his doctor wanted to make sure his testes \"were there\". I can't recall what age he was.\n* He had bloodwork done at the time and hormones, thyroid, etc. came back normal as far as he can recall\n* He offhandedly, jokingly commented the other day about going through puberty late\n* Thinning of the hair on top/crown of his head which hasn't worsened in the time I've known him\n* He's tall (6'4\") with long arms and legs. But so is his half-sister. Their mother is average height/proportions; haven't met their dads\n* He was massively overweight in his teens, but amazingly lost ~150lbs by his early 20s. \n* He is pear shaped, in that his abdomen carries alot of his bulk, and has the appearance of wide hips/waist with a narrow chest\n* Slightly knock-kneed, not too noticable with pants/shorts on (not sure if this is just a result of his childhood obesity though) [saw this issue included in a KS illustration]\n* He does have excess \"breast tissue\", but this could also be the result of massive weight loss. He believes it's gynecomastia but hasn't had it diagnosed.\n* Not much visible muscle mass in his arms; my bicep flex would be more noticable than his. This could be from loose skin too though? Calves have definition, but that's about it. Forearms are slim and almost feel sharp. He is able to lift me up, carry heavy stuff, etc.\n* I have no idea how to decipher what can be the result of goofy weight distribution genes and/or dramatic weight loss. He also works a desk IT job and isn't very physically active these days, so who knows what's under all his fluff\n* Additionally: No sexual dysfunction, plenty of body and facial hair, no cognitive issues, no broken bones\n\nI love this man to pieces, and I want to approach this in the most rational, supportive, loving way possible. He knows about my expectations regarding kids, so that part won't scare him. I just want to be ahead of the game, no matter what the news is.\n\nHow would you want someone to broach this topic with you if you were in his shoes? What worked well for you if you were in this position, in either set of shoes? I don't want to needlessly scare him, just encourage him to get some bloodwork and a physical while specifically discussing his reproductive health with his doc. I figure I can also schedule the same for myself so we can be united in our efforts - I'm overdue!\n\nThanks to anyone who has read this far!!

Why? Well, there's some reason:\n\n1. I am too busy for myself that I won't have time to raise a child, or even being in a relationship. I think relationships are great and kids are awesome, but it's not for everyone - at least for me. I basically won't be able to be an ideal mother, or wife.\n2. With my line of work, it's quite impossible to start a family of my own, let alone raising a child. Don't get me wrong, I love kids, I help my sister raise her son (now 6 years old), I also work with an NGO where I'll be away from home most of the time. And to just let my kinds to stay with their grandparents would sound selfish for me. What's the point of having a child but not being there throughout their developing time.\n3. I get emotional easily, especially when I'm in so much stress. And I've been avoiding to get too emotional for several years now, and it worked out just fine so I want to keep it that way. I hate it when it ruins my professional life.\n4. I think with all these eggs I have, I can help people out there who's been desperate for a child but not getting any suitable donor. If I personally refuse to have a child myself, why don't just offer my generous help for people who are actually need and want a child?\n\nThe problem is, I live in the (fucking) Southeast Asia, and people would misinterpret my choice as a way of getting money or doing some shitty scams. I understand the stereotypes, but let's be civilized for a bit and stop all the judgements. Cause my only goal is to make my life a bit useful for other people. Sadly, becoming an egg donor is \"banned\" in my country, considered as organ selling :/ I really want to help somebody out there, I just don't know who or how I'm gonna be able to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any of you need an egg donor, please do let me know.

If so, how long after quitting estrogen did you start your period? How long did it delay your next cycle?\nThanks in advance!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11826, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cancelled FET due to ovulation", "updated_utc": 1554053497, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ayvmhb/cancelled_fet_due_to_ovulation/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
