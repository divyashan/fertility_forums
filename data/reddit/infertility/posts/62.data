In the meantime I was trying to conceive and saw a fertility specialist earlier this year. I was pretty certain my problem was endometriosis, and then we found out one of my tubes was blocked. After much trying my OB did a laparoscopy and cleared the endo last month. He then put me on a suppressive treatment for three months (currently starting month 2) and he said that once I was done I would repeat the HSG and then we would go all on with trying to conceive. While this all sounded good, the damn urinary infections keep coming back.\n\nI've been seeing a special urologist and we have done everything we can. When I had my lap he was going to do a cystoscopy but we were unable to do it because I had a UTI going into surgery so he didn't feel comfortable doing it because of the heightened risk of infection. We tried to treat it and now I went for a follow up on Saturday and the infection is still not gone. He is sending me to an even more specialized doctor. I asked him what that meant for our plans trying to conceive and he wasn't clear. All he mentioned was the risk of miscarriage in case of a kidney infection (which thank God, it has never gone beyond my bladder).\n\nI haven't spoken to my OB yet, but I am scared that this will now mean that we went through with the lap for nothing. I am scared both doctors will tell me it's best I put off trying to conceive until the infections are under control. I know this is the reasonable thing to do, but it hurts my heart so much, but what do you guys think? If I am able to get things straight technically I have two full months to get the infection addressed in time to resume my fertility treatments. Maybe more depending on when my cycle actually comes back (my OB said it could take up to 30 days to get my cycle back. My last pill on the treatment is on September 12th and I see him on the 21st. If I have my cycle by then, I should be starting on Femara around that time). But I don't know.\n\nI feel so lost and defeated. What do you guys think? What do you think I should do? I know I can't stay on this suppressive medication forever but I also know it's hard to know how quickly the endo will grow back once I stop it. I am so scared over everything; all I want is to have a baby and things just keep getting in the way.

This is the same ovary at my OBGYNs office they told me they wanted to remove due to a large endometrioma. The left ovary is behind my uterus, and there is a large cyst chilling around the ovary. It shows no signs of endometrioma and that doctor thinks it was not right to say I have endo because he can\u2019t see any signs on u/s and he\u2019s seen 1,000s of endometrioma and has published numerous articles on them. He wants to do an HSG, and day 3 blood work which is awesome. \n\nHe just went in there and started doctoring vs SGF which explained how conception works and that people like me that have endometriosis can try IVF and should get an egg retrieval down. That doctor wanted to do an HSG and day 3 blood work but I love how this doctor was like let\u2019s take a look and see what\u2019s going on. I can\u2019t blame the SGF doctor because this doctor has years and years on him and is extremely educated and is so high up in the Fertility community.

(Functional cysts.)\n\nPrior to my first RE visit last week, I decided to write a letter. There is only one thing that will make me sob hysterically - being frustrated beyond words. My medical history is full of frustration.\n\nI didn\u2019t see writing a letter suggested anywhere and initially wrote it out to prepare my speech as if it were an important work conversation or presentation. I thought maybe if I printed it out and handed it over the RE might think I\u2019m crazy. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m crazy (in not so many words) by doctors many times. First as I sought treatment for my hypothyroidism symptoms. More recently I\u2019ve been repeatedly told by multiple doctors that my cysts can\u2019t be as big/frequent as I think, they\u2019re not a problem for fertility, and that I shouldn\u2019t be worried about ovarian cystectomies/torsion impacting my ability to have a baby. Now that I\u2019ve decided to find a doctor who is knowledgeable about my specific issues, maybe it\u2019s good if an RE reads my letter and thinks I\u2019m crazy. It would rule them out immediately and save me a lot of time.\n\nMy RE was very receptive to the letter (one of the CCRM locations), so I thought I\u2019d share in case anyone else would find this helpful. Doc seemed to *like* the bullet points!\n\n**The letter.** I wrote it after completing the intake paperwork, so I focused most on what didn\u2019t fit on their blanks or might be confusing.\n\nDr. Name:\n\nI\u2019m coming to you because I have constant large ovarian cysts that either rupture or cause me to need surgery. I now know that the unexplained sudden pain I\u2019ve had since a teen is what it feels like when a cyst ruptures and the fluid irritates my abdomen. This pain is the reason I began birth control in high school and took it for 15 years. Since then, any time I\u2019ve gone off birth control I\u2019ve had a cyst either the first or second cycle off it. In June of 2017 my husband and I hit our financial goals to make it possible for me to quit birth control long enough to start a family, even if it meant the missed workdays would negatively impact my employment prior to pregnancy.\n\nIn the last year I\u2019ve had 2 cystectomies and 3 obvious ruptures.\n\n* August 25, 2017 - left cystectomy, 2nd cycle off BC.\n* Going forwards, I decided to begin tracking my cycle and ovulation to increase chances of quick conception.\n* November 5, 2017 - cyst rupture pain CD17 (ovulation CD11), 5th cycle since BC.\n* December 1, 2017 - cyst rupture pain CD17 (ovulation CD14), 6th cycle since BC.\n* January - April 2018 - Partial Molar Pregnancy\n* May 23, 2018 - right ovarian torsion &amp; cystectomy CD9 (ovulation CD16). 10th cycle since BC.\n* July 1, 2018 - left ovarian cyst rupture CD19 (ovulation CD14), 11th cycle since BC.\n\nBefore each surgery I have been warned of the main risk, I \u201cmight loose an ovary\u201d in surgery. I think if cysts and surgery keep happening so frequently, I will become that statistic.\n\nMy cysts are so normalized to me that I struggle to notice symptoms until they become severe. Plus they grow very fast, seemingly too fast to obtain an appointment to diagnosis and discuss options quick enough to have any effect on the outcome. My most recent right cyst began causing minimal abdominal discomfort on a Wednesday, by Friday I became suspicious I had a cyst about to rupture, by Tuesday evening it became too painful to tolerate and I went to the ER, surgery to correct the torsion was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. My most recent left cyst was nonexistent during that surgery, measured 6.8cm three weeks later at a post-op appointment where I was able to obtain an immediate sonogram, and ruptured 5 weeks after surgery (as confirmed by sonogram 2 days after rupture.) And looking at my history, if I had been able to detect the cysts and try going back to birth control briefly, I would have only been off it for a few cycles in the past year - making the odds of a positive pregnancy test very low.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. My husband and I do not feel like we\u2019re on a path to become parents. I feel like I am on a path to loose my ovaries. I\u2019m here hoping to find out what effect these ruptures, the ovarian torsion, and surgeries are having on my fertility? Is it possible to become pregnant in a cycle with a large cyst rupture or cystectomy? What is your advice regarding my concerns?\n\nRegards,\nChronicallyClassy\n\n**The plan**\n\nRE has another patient with the same issues! I\u2019m not crazy, not some kind of medical abnormality. Apparently the current running theory is that constant huge cysts are cause by pituitary dysfunction. RE recommends that I take HBC unless doing active treatment in order to prevent cysts and preserve my remaining fertility.\n\nSince we are paying out of pocket, we\u2019ve just agreed to pay for testing at this point. Had blood draws done at LabCorp in hopes that insurance will at least pay for some of the labs. We\u2019ll stop and evaluate before our next steps.\n\nI\u2019ve lurked here extensively.

They will ID embryos as normal, abnormal, or mosaic (but nothing about degree of mosaicism). Cost is $2000 flat fee for up to 10 embryos across multiple cycles. My clinic will keep the mosaics if I want them to.\n\nWhat would you do? Any experiences working with either of these providers? Were the reports informative and useful? \n\nI'm leaning toward making the switch to FEC so I can hang on to mosaics but haven't seen either of these companies mentioned much around here, so I wanted to check in with the braintrust...

I haven\u2019t seen a similar situation to mine by searching so I was hoping for some input and support as we start this part of our path. \n\nCW: c section surgery \n\nI\u2019m turning 39 in a few weeks. I had intraoperative complications during a c section in January of 2017. Large 12 cm fibroid had to be removed during the surgery which caused massive bleeding, long surgical time, and a bad recovery. \n\nIn May of 2017 I had an abdominal myomectomy to remove remaining large fibroids because pregnancy attempts were not advised while they were still there. When my surgeon got in there he saw numerous fibroids, massive pelvic adhesions from the prior surgery, affecting bladder, ovaries, tubes, large and small bowel. Basically everything was fused together with scar tissue. \n\nSurgeon was a champ. Separated everything. When he separated bladder from uterus, basically my uterus fell apart and there was a large hole in it. He could see down to my cervix. He separated everything, removed several 10 cm+ and multiple other smaller fibroids. Consulted with an RE during surgery because he knew the point of this was preserving my fertility if possible. Sewed up my uterus, put a ballon catheter in to reduce further scar tissue. \n\nPost op I did as well as can be expected. Consulted with the RE after. HSG showed normal fill and spill. Blood work was good re AMH and FSH especially for my age, 19 antral follicles on day 3. That was August 2017. We were given the clear to start trying January 2018. \n\nNo success with timed intercourse since January 2018. I know that\u2019s not a long time, but given my age and complications I got referral to another RE (I moved across the state since then). I believe I\u2019m ovulating with regular cycles and confirmed with BBT. Multiple follow up SIS show obvious scar in my uterus, definitely high risk, but not antithetical to pregnancy. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just sharing for thoughts on this situation. Any questions I should ask RE specific to my situation? Anyone been through something similar? Should I jump right to IVF if recommended? I\u2019m concerned about my age. Thanks for reading.

I've been around for awhile, commenting here and there, and while I have this down time I figured it would be a good time to properly introduce myself!\n\nI am 33. Husband is 40.  \nTW!: We got spontaneously pregnant in Feb 2012 after less than a year of dating (I know, what a bitch). I was 26 and definitely not ready to have a baby. After a ton of discussion, we opted to have an elective D&amp;C. No complications. We got married a year later and lived life for a bit.\n\nWe started trying in September 2016 fully expecting to get pregnant right away because of that history (LOL). I had been having regular 30 day cycles at that point, with a 14 day luteal phase. Nothing, month after month. My April 2017 cycle never resulted in a period - I went to my gyno in early May, who suggested we wait a bit. Nothing in May. Went back into gyno early June and did bloodwork and ultrasound. I was diagnosed with \"borderline PCOS\" - I have polycystic ovaries and elevated testosterone (113 H ng/dL total), but no other symptoms. We did three rounds of Letrozole and timed intercourse, one round including an HCG trigger, which brought us up to October 2017. I was referred to an RE at a major fertility clinic here in SoCal and started taking Ovasitol. \n\nAt this point, I am so frustrated and confused. We were able to get pregnant before! WTF! Every month got sadder and sadder. Friends of mine who I talked about \"starting to try\" with were getting pregnant, or about to give birth. RE confirmed the borderline aspect of my PCOS. I asked to be put on Metformin even though I am not insulin resistant, because I felt like I needed to do SOMETHING, and after a bumpy start with that, have been on 500mg of the extended release version a day since January. We continued trying \"naturally\" with no luck. I did, and continue to do, every PCOS / AIP / Paleo / Dairy Free / Gluten Free diet known to man. \n\nFinally did the HSG in April - ow! Uterus is great and no issues, right tube is great and no issues, but they couldn't get imaging of my full left tube (distal blockage). Lab tech tells the RE it is blocked and not patent. Follow up with the RE day after HSG, she confirms the left tubal blockage and suggests two cycles of IUI with FSH injectables. As I am wrapping my head around \"injectables,\" and \"blocked tube,\" RE calls back to say that, now that she's watched the DVD of my HSG, she thinks my tube *seized* instead of being blocked. That's a relief, so we immediately move ahead to Follistim, HCG, and IUI. We are super fortunate that husband has NO PROBLEMS, in fact, has lots of great sperm!\n\nI had zero issues with the Follistim injections (I was always on a very low dose) - husband did 99.9% of them and was a pro. Must have watched the injection video 100 times! We were hopeful, but not excited. I think I was just focusing on the newness of everything I was doing, and getting used to all the bloodwork and ultrasounds. We had two good follicles when we triggered - one on each side (18mm, 17mm), though of course the left was dominant. May IUI did not work. I was disappointed, but not surprised. I kept thinking, \"the second one will work, the second one will work,\" so we went into the June IUI SUPER EXCITED, really trying to be positive. I added acupuncture to this cycle. I had three great follicles - 18mm, 18mm, 17mm - all on the left ovary. Still, the RE didn't seem concerned. We did two inseminations. Everything has always looked good, but particularly this cycle: Day 3 FSH was 5.79, LH 3.48; two days before trigger lining was 8.9 and E2 was 526.46. It doesn't work and we are crushed. \n\nWe went in to the RE to do a follow up and discuss next steps on 7/5. She advised against a laparoscopy or anything else to try and look at or clear the tube, and against redoing the HSG. I did CA-125 bloodwork which was negative for endometriosis. Since that was the case, I didn't want to do another IUI with everything being the same, since it just feels like peeing away money. So: IVF. \n\nRE recommended ICSI and PGS testing to us (our clinic doesn't do fresh transfers at all anyway) even though we don't have a male factor issue. We'd be spending so much money that I feel like, we might as well, and maybe save the pain and expense of multiple transfers. We have lots of travel coming up in the next couple of months, so we set our start date as two cycles from now. We're in limbo until early October. \n\nRE has been super optimistic this whole time. She was sure the IUI would work. Of IVF, she said, \"you have always been so responsive to meds, and with your age and AMH level (3.49), you will only need one retrieval for two kids.\" She thinks I'll get 15-25 eggs. Okay. I'm afraid to trust her optimism. I'm not afraid of the injections, or endless appointments, or crazy diets, or supplements, or more acupuncture, or surgery, or INSANE COST, or anything - I am just afraid that it won't work. I'm sure that is a familiar feeling to all of you. September will be two years, and while I know there are so many who have been at it for so much longer, and in worse situations than us, I'm just sad. I'm so ready for a baby.\n\nThis community has helped me so much, even if I haven't posted a ton, just reading your stories and cheering or virtually hugging alongside you all has been really meaningful, and I felt more comfortable making the decision to move to IVF because of it. So - THANK YOU. I'll leave you with one small LOL: our clinic offers \"extended services\" to their VIP patients (because the clinic sees a LOT of celebrities) and they offered it to us. For an extra $5,500 (on top of the $26,000 you are already paying), you don't have to wait in the lobby, a nurse will administer all of your shots every day, and you get \"priority access\" to the embryoscope. Husband and I had a good laugh about that.
