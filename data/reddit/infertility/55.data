I don't why, but deep inside I worry my egg quality is not good enough.\n\nLong story short we retrieved 5 eggs.  And managed to get to day 6 with 1 hatching blast, but not enough cellular material to biopsy....1 early blast...and 1 other one still behind.

So many things these days have pregnancy/infertility storylines and despite being an eternal optimist, I've been finding IVF round 2 particularly emotional and difficult to deal with.\n\nI've always made random websites so I said I'd look into creating something where we could have safe stuff listed so that others can know they're not going to be blindsided. \n\nI'm planning to add categories for TV, Films, Video Games, Books, and also have an infertility section with media that has excellent portrayals of infertility, for those feeling strong enough to watch those (How To Buy A Baby, etc).\n\nWhat I'm seeking really is any input into what you'd want to see on this site (suggestions for categories etc)? And I'd also appreciate any early submissions to get the ball rolling.\n\nAlso, any site name suggestions?\n\nThoughts appreciated! &lt;3 to everyone.\n\n**Edited to add**: Also, would you like it to be a searchable resource of what to avoid?

We've been married for going on 4 years in October. Back in 08 when he asked me to marry him we also came to the conclusion he didn't want kids. I adapted and found this an acceptable life choice for us. Now I have to add that I had been on pills from 16 to 25 off a year then on seasonal for a little over a year. I finished the pills in September and menstrual wise everything seemed fine until October when my cycle started to come 2days later then in November it was 5 days later. In December it was a week later then January I had a relief bleed to release built up tissue. After taking several test was concluded not pregnant. That being said I couldn't go to my gyno bc I no longer had insurance and we make to much to get free care. I have gone through the means to get blood tests which concluded not thyroid problem and testosterone levels were fine. Second set of test concluded my lh was 3 times higher than my fsh. We discovered I'm infertile. That being said still inconclusive as to what is going on especially since no other signs for pcos. Now it is Feb and I am now on 40 days since last bleed. While we decided against having kids I can't help but feel heartbroken about no longer having the ability if anything were to change and feel like I am broken. It doesn't help that as a contact person I feel like I am alone because he's withdrawn. He says he's concerned about me but refuses to even engage with me sexually for concern of chancing a random ovulation. Which only compacts more to feeling broken. I feel really alone and don't have anyone to talk to this and no real resources to reference in this. I am also scared because I don't have a reason for why this has come about all of the sudden.

Remember, these are just my observations and how things worked for us, but maybe this info can help someone else.\n\n\n**background**\n\nWe have severe MFI: original SA's were in the 200,000 range, now at about 1.7 million. No known female issues for me except for controlled hypothyroidism. I started IVF at 36 and now am 38, so that probably doesn't help either. \n\nWe've done 9 retrievals - you can [see our detailed hunger games info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7yxav3/lpt_first_time_ivf_ladies_get_emotionally_ready/duk5hca/). For all except our first 2 cycles, my husband has taken Ovidrel (hcg) every 3 days in the weeks before and during stims in an effort to boost testosterone.\n\n\n**previous clinics/protocols**\n\nIn short, our first clinic we did two fresh transfers using Gonal/Luveris/Cetrotide, and the second led to an MC at 12 weeks. No PGS in that clinic so we left.\n\nOur second clinic did PGS on day 3 with transfer on day 5 (known to be less accurate, but we never had anything freeze on day 5). We did 4 batching cycles with them all frozen on day 3. They had switched me to menopur and retrieval numbers were way down. I'm convinced the extra LH was a problem. We also used HGH on me starting on stims day 1 for all cycles. After all that, only one out of about 5 or 6 embryos on Day 5 was normal and that transfer failed. On to a new clinic.\n\n\n**current clinic**\n\nWe've done 3 retrievals at our current clinic. It's a huge clinic with its own PGS lab, and I believe lab quality has also made a big difference for us.  All 3 protocols were microdose lupron protocols with Pergoveris, which is like menopur but a 2:1 ratio of FSH:LH instead of 1:1. And Ovidrel trigger.\nFor all 3 cycles we froze on Day 5 (or 6) and then PGS. \n\nOur first two cycles in our new clinic, I used HGH only during stims. We had a 50% normal rate - 3 of 6 total blasts tested normal. Our last FET failed.\n\nFor our most recent stim cycle, my RE had both me AND my husband on HGH for 10 weeks before retrieval. He actually wanted 3 months, but was ok with 10 weeks. I took .33mg daily and my husband took .5mg daily. I believe the clinic uses these as their standard female/male doses. \n\nIn our previous two cycles at this clinic, we had 33% of our fertilized eggs make it to blast (12&gt;4, and 6&gt;2). This most recent cycle was 43% - so 3 of 7 fertilized were frozen. The biggest difference was that all 3 came back as PGS normal. We couldn't believe that we had a 100% normal rate, after two cycles with a 50% normal rate. \n\nGetting 3 normals in a single cycle of 7 fertilized, versus getting 3 normals from 18 fertilized across two cycles is a huge difference. I strongly suspect that the main difference must have been the HGH's effect, especially on the sperm quality.\n\n\n\n**Here's everything we did differently this last cycle:**\n\n-10 weeks of HGH for both partners, finished the night before retrieval\n\n-I was put on Metformin (500 twice a day) since August in an effort to keep polyps at bay\n\n-I took 3mg of melatonin every night during stims only. Here's [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209073/)\n\n-we both took Acai supplements daily for 3+ months before retrieval based on [this study](https://www.ccrmivf.com/blog/ccrm-study-finds-that-high-doses-of-acai-berry-can-improve-ivf-outcomes/) \n\n-I lost some weight, about 15lbs.\n\n-Added some other supplements (see below)\n\n\n\n**We've both always taken a variety of supplements including:**\n\n-COQ10 (both)\n\n-Vit E (both)\n\n-selenium (both)\n\n-Vit D (both)\n\n-prenatal (me)\n\n-B-complex (him)\n\n-Zinc (him)\n\n-L-carnitine (him)\n\n-folic acid (both)\n\n-Omega 3/fish oil (both)\n\n\n**In the last few months we added in,**\n\n-tart cherry juice pills for antioxidant value (both)\n\n-lycopene (both)\n\n-NAC (me)\n\n-Alphalipoic acid (me)\n\n-acai (both)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am remaining on HGH until transfer next month, as there are [studies that show success rates are improved](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27101995)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR: Severe MFI. We previously had two stim cycles with 33% of fertilized embryos making it to blasts and only 50% of those were PGS normal. For those, only I (female partner) took HGH during stims. However, our latest cycle had 42% fert&gt;blast rate and 100% were normal, after both partners were on HGH for 10 weeks before retrieval. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sharing about our improved embryo quality after extended human growth hormone (HGH) use", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7z8o7z/sharing_about_our_improved_embryo_quality_after/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "kmm151", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "36F | 3 IVF | Low AMH | DOR"}], "author_flair_text": "36F | 3 IVF | Low AMH | DOR", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519245147, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1519247813, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7z8sx5/anyone_out_there_on_ivf_4/", "id": "7z8sx5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 27, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7z8sx5/anyone_out_there_on_ivf_4/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1519300459, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 7, "selftext": "I'd love to hear from others who did many rounds of IVF (4 or more) \u2014 the good, bad, and ugly.

My husbands younger brother is married to a girl who is my age.  We hadn't been super close, but since starting my infertility journey, she has seemingly been super supportive.  I have trusted her with everything I am going through and even had her come to some IUI appointments that my husband could not make.  We started trying to get pregnant around the same time (2 years ago).  She now has a daughter that is almost a year old.  As open as I have been with her, I assumed she was 100% transparent with me as well.  I had asked her when she would try for #2 and shes always said, oh not for a while yet.  LIES.  We had a family party on Sunday.  I had been dreading going to it because most of my husbands family does not know we have done IVF and had a failed FET.  I'm just so tired of pretending like everything is ok, when nothing is ok.  We are there for 10 minutes before my husbands cousin hands us an ultrasound picture and announces  their pregnancy.  I lost it.  We left as I sobbed.  While driving home, I am texting with my sister in law and she admits that she is pregnant as well.  I cried so hard, I vomited.  She texted, that they had been trying and she had hoped that I would have been the one to get pregnant first...... BUT she had been trying and GOTTEN PREGNANT before I even had my first transfer.  So that is a bold faced lie.  I don't expect them to put their family building on hold for me... but don't act like you care about my feelings, or hope that I get pregnant first, without even giving me a chance!  I don't have a shot at getting pregnant every month like she does.\n\nFurther spurring my rage:  My husband and I had planned a trip to Disney, which is coming up next month.  We had dreamed that we might be able to wear pregnancy announcement shirts at the magic kingdom.  Well, my sister in law decided to now also go to Disney the same time as us.... and SHE will get to wear the pregnancy shirt and dress her daughter up in an \"I'm going to be a big sister\" shirt.  I'm so angry and jealous and hurt.  I trusted my sister in law and wish she had just had the courtesy of at least telling me that they were trying.  I wish she was transparent about her plans :-(", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Blindsided/stabbed in the back by sister in law", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zf5z8/blindsidedstabbed_in_the_back_by_sister_in_law/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "QueenOfTheHarpies35", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "33F, TTC 3+ years | MFI | 5 IUIs | IVF #1 = CP | FET in Apr?"}], "author_flair_text": "33F, TTC 3+ years | MFI | 5 IUIs | IVF #1 = CP | FET in Apr?", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519310991, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zfe68/more_infertility_poetry/", "id": "7zfe68", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 34, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7zfe68/more_infertility_poetry/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1519355849, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 18, "selftext": "/u/combinatorialist totally inspired me to try to write an infertility-inspired poem.

We have been doing IUI for 6 months (2 actual cycles thus far), I was diagnosed with a uterine polyp in january and will get back to trying in March.  \n\nI am a nurse and for the first 8 yrs of my career was in pediatrics, then since 2014 have been post partum and now L&amp;D.  Interestingly, none of my worm environment has been a large trigger for me...I don't know why.  \n\nOne of my best friends had a little one 1.5 yrs ago, and another about 6 months ago.  The first one didnt bother me, but as soon as i heard of the second, i was angry with her, sad for me, and have not been able to be a good friend to her since the news and especially since her little one was born.  I think its because she complains constantly about being tired, normal issues re: sleep, feeding, getting things done, her husband not helping enough or getting enough \"me time\", being \"attached\" all the time, etc.  I have withdrawn from her explaining that complaints are just too much to bear for me as they are things i would be eternally grateful to experience.  She sorta understands. \n\nMy second trigger came last week.  A coworker (who started near the time i did at wk in October) found out she has accidentally become pregnant.  Her husband doesnt want a 3rd child and her youngest is 6mo.  It is so frustrating that the literal ONE time she had sex in the last 6 months, she accidentally got pregnant.  And for her this feels a burden, and for her husband, not even wanted.  Im  afraid of saying something at work that I dont mean.  Or crying in front of her when she talks of how stressful it is, etc.  \n\nIs this just the beginning of a never-ending slew of triggers?  I am scared to become bitter.  To become unable to work in this field of nursing I have worked for 7 years to get into and love.  Im scared that i will stop finding joy in children.\n\nIf anyone has any words of encouragement or advice i would really appreciate it.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Smallish rant re: emotional triggers", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zjoqw/smallish_rant_re_emotional_triggers/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "Astingel2016", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519346485, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zjxtg/pregnancy_loss/", "id": "7zjxtg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7zjxtg/pregnancy_loss/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1519405121, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 0, "selftext": "Yesterday I experienced the best and worst day of my life all at once.

Just had my first ER yesterday and I felt beyond prepared...just wanted to thank this unbelievably strong and educated community for that.\n\nMy husband and I work in research and I found this article after reviewing my pre-retrieval labs.  It is a few years old but I thought was helpful with putting into perspective how progesterone may play a role not only in implantation but also at the time of retrieval.  The focus is in an antagonist protocol.\n\nhttp://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(13)03282-2/fulltext\n\nI think what hit home for me with it was the clinical consideration with looking at progesterone levels at the day of oocyte retrieval and using that to make a decision about fresh vs frozen transfer.  I think so much we hear about E2/estrogen being a big influence (esp with OHSS) with deciding on a fresh or frozen transfer but this was the first I had read about progesterone (I am also a newbie to this so apologies if this is old news).\n\nI also thought that it was interesting that they suggest possibly considering continued dosing with an antagonist post-retrieval to keep progesterone levels down?

Losing hope with each negative beta.  Each one more painful than the one before it.  But for the first time since seeking medical help almost six years ago, we finally have an idea what's wrong, and more importantly, how to treat it.\n\nAfter 13 IUIs, three chemical pregnancies, one m/c, four separate IVF stim cycles and egg retrievals, three cancelled and six failed embryo transfers, and six more embryos lost to PGS testing we are not left with much hope nor prospects for a sucessful outcome.  My wife has been through multiple RPL panels, a littany of bloodwork and testing, keryotyping, biopsy after biopsy.  We treated for a mild endometritis infection.  But everything seemed within an acceptable range.  We tried a natural FET.  She tried increasing her lining with viagra and supplements.  Since graduating from IUI to IVF, never even the faintest hint of HCG, always zero.  \n\nWe long suspected that we had an implantation issue, even before we started PGS testing embryos to confirm this.  My wifes lining is somewhat thin, but usually in the 7.5 to 8 range, which should be enough, especially after multiple tries.  We suspected there might be adhesions left over from a D&amp;C done after a heartbreaking misscarriage at 11 weeks.  That was IUI number 9, and was due to Trisomy 13.  Perhaps the saline sonos had missed something, but no, a hysteroscopy confirmed everything was completely normal.  Next, we suspected a timing issue, however the ERA  test is not licensed in our state.  While we were starting down the path of planning an out of state excusion to have the ERA biopsy done, our doctor suggested that we do a receptiva DX test since this cycle was going to be a wash anyway.  A week after what was described as a most excrutiatingly painful biopsy, the results came back and we got a hit.  She scored 3.7 out of 4.  Endometriosis.  While this score doesnt necessarily corolate to the severity of the Endo, it does mean theres a very high likelihood that there is indeed Endo.  Finally, we have an answer as to why.\n\nWe never thought Endo was a very likely possibility.  In all honesty, despite how common it is, we dismissed entirely it early on.  My wife does not have particularly painful nor heavy periods.  While perhaps not very enjoyable (my fault, I know) intercourse was never painful.  We have a previous history of pregnancy.  Nothing seemed to point in that direction, yet here we have it staring us right in the face.  The BCL-6 cutoff for normal is below 1.4, and she has a 3.7.  The beta3 integrin test cutoff is above .75, and we had a .25.  But how could this be?  Has she always had it?  Was it caused by the D&amp;C?  Perhaps her cessarian incision healed with uterine tissue on the outside?  I guess it makes sense that it's always been there.  Endo doesnt necessarily mean 100% infertility.  It could well be the reason fertility was so difficult just before it became impossible.  Perhaps the insanely high levels of estrogen during repeated IVF cycles have fed it, making matters worse.\n\nAs expected Our doctor suggested two months of Lupron Depot, and then right into a medicated FET.  We have two PSG normal embryos remaining.  Another failure will push us towards an out of state ERA test, and possibly persuing immunologic issues.  But for now, we just want to get through the next two months of medicated temporary menopause, and go into the next cycle with renewed optimism. \n\nIve done as much research as I can regarding Endo here, in the endo sub, and out there in the googles.  Still theres a lot of missed or conflicting information.  I would love to hear any suggestions anyone might be able to add.\n\nWhile our doctor is not recommending prednisone, she is not averse to the idea.  Is there any reason to suspect additional immunologic issues at play?  My wife has well controlled hypothyroidism (non hasimotos), which leads me to believe it could be a possibility.  Ive seen others here add Letrozole / Femara, which was not prescribed.  I know that two big names in the immunologic infertility area are fans of an anti-inflammatory diet (gluten free, lactose free, etc).  Are there any opinions as to if this is more fact or fiction?\n\nLastly, how long a window do we have after a 2 month Lupron treatment?  I guess this is different for every case, especially since we are not doing a lap to excise the endometriosis, or even inspect how prevalent it is.  I have to assume that the endo will slowly come back, as soon as estrogen is re-introduced, but does it happen within weeks?  Months?  A year perhaps?  Its  the one quiestion I neglected to ask our doctor last we spoke.\n\nThank  you all for your contributions to this sub.  Its been an incredible source of information and inspiration.

I had a suspected chemical pregnancy in March of last year and the doctor tested for Day 3 bloodwork during the cycle of the chemical pregnancy.  Fast forward a year later and I have changed doctors and clinics as well as labs. Basically, I'm starting over because I hated my doctor at Kaiser. She was such a bitch and didn't care at all about me. She thought I was too young to be worrying about getting pregnant. I'm 28 and I wanted a baby like 2 years ago.\n\n My new doctor, whom I love so far, wanted to repeat all of the tests including my husband's sperm analysis and my DAY 3 labs. I just got my results today and I don't see my doctor until Monday. I also had a follicular ultrasound done and I have fluid contrast ultrasound scheduled for next Monday as well. The doctor wants to discuss everything with me after she has all the testing done. The thing I am most worried about is that my AMH levels increased so much that I might now have PCOS. \n\nMarch 2017 Results (Done on Day 3 of suspected chemical pregnancy):\nLH= 5.4 mIU/mL\nFSH= 7.1 mIU/mL\nEstradiol 27 pg/mL\nAMH= 2.7 ng/mL\n\nThis Week's Results:(The doctor didn't test for LH)\nFSH: mIU/mL\nEstradiol: 14.1 pg/mL\nAMH: 5.68 ng/mL\n\n I was hoping to get answers from all of you wonderful people before I drive myself crazy with all the researching.

I became really anemic because of the cysts (apparently they\u2019re bleeding into themselves). The anemia apparently has caused a mild heart murmur that the anesthesiologist wanted checked out before surgery that was scheduled for today. \n\nWoke up to a snowstorm \ud83d\ude12, but blissfully my dad said he\u2019d come get me. Roads were awful, but we made it there. The sonogram operator asked me when my surgery was, and then asked me in the most obnoxious voice if I was going to be able to get pregnant after the surgery. This is literally a huge fear of mine because we have no idea what impact the cysts may have had on my eggs, whether surgery will effect my reserves, or if I\u2019ll lose an ovary (25% chance that I\u2019ll lose at least one). I had no idea how to respond to her, I felt like I was going to either have a panic attack or punch her in the throat (I did neither). She took my silence to mean she could go on and tell me about a friend of hers that got pregnant right away after having an endo surgery and it\u2019s super common and everyone has babies. This after all my drs agreed that my endo is particularly aggressive, but yeah, whatever, endo is the same for everyone. She was also NOT gentle with the probe. I understand she needed to get the image, but it felt like she was trying to snap a rib. Another tech had to come and get more images and did not read my chart or see my huge swollen belly and slammed the probe into my upper abdomen, and then said \u201coh, did that hurt?\u201d. Not impressed by this entire department. \n\nAlso, I started telling a few of my vendors and business associates at work that I was going on leave and arranging alternate contacts for them. Two of them straight up asked me if I was going on maternity leave. One just said \u201csooooo what\u2019s up with you going on leave\u201d in a super prying voice. These are not people from my company, just people I need work with once in a while (lawyers, vendors etc). I have no personal relationship with them and only 1/3 knows I\u2019m even married because she was around when I changed my last name. \n\nAs excited as I am to have this surgery, I also know that it means that we\u2019re coming off the bench soon and potentially getting back onto the IVF train. Part of me is excited, and part of me is absolutely terrified to go through it again. It was physically one of the most painful things I\u2019ve even endured (mostly due to the cysts), and definitely the most emotionally difficult. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll get to use my eggs or if we\u2019ll have to use donor eggs, though I guess we won\u2019t know until a few weeks after surgery. \n\nAnyway, thanks if you made it to the end of this rant/ wall of text. Just felt like I was going to burst if I didn\u2019t get it out. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Echo Nightmare and Surgery Next Week", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zuuud/echo_nightmare_and_surgery_next_week/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519464949, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zvmou/saturday_active_treatment_thread/", "id": "7zvmou", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 61, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7zvmou/saturday_active_treatment_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1519555999, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 9, "selftext": "This thread is for updates and discussion on active treatment \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Saturday ACTIVE Treatment Thread", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zvmou/saturday_active_treatment_thread/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519466947, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zvrhx/saturday_off_topic_thread/", "id": "7zvrhx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 52, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7zvrhx/saturday_off_topic_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1519556946, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 5, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on whether embryos did or did not grow more than the 4-cell stage on the afternoon of ET. The odds of clinical pregnancy and live birth were considered as primary outcomes. Student\u2019s t-tests and Chi-square (\u03c72) tests were used as inidicated, with logistic regression controlling for maternal age and number of embryos transferred.\n\nResults\nThree hundred forty three patients were identified for inclusion: 165 and 178 patients had 4-cell embryos with and without growth on the afternoon of ET, respectively. The demographic and baseline IVF cycle characteristics of the study cohort were comparable. Patients with embryo growth had higher clinical pregnancy (13.9 % vs. 4.49 %) and live birth (10.9 % vs. 3.37 %) rates compared to patients without embryo growth. This represented an overall increased odds of clinical pregnancy [Odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20093.44; 95 % Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.49\u20137.93; P\u2009=\u20090.004)] and live birth (OR\u2009=\u20093.51; 95 % CI 1.36\u20139.07; P\u2009=\u20090.01). The increased odds remained unchanged after adjusting for maternal age and number of embryos transferred.\n\nConclusions\nTransfer of 4-cell embryos 3 days after oocyte retrieval can result in clinical pregnancies and live births, albeit at a low rate. Growth of an embryo more than the 4-cell stage on the afternoon of ET may serve as a positive prognostic factor for IVF-ET cycle outcome.\n\n*This study seemed very fitting for me today so I figured I would share it here*", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Study - Prognostic value of growth of 4-cell embryos on the day of transfer in fresh IVF-ET cycles", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zyqar/study_prognostic_value_of_growth_of_4cell_embryos/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "Pamzella", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "40 TTC MFI &amp; DOR 1MC 7IUIs"}], "author_flair_text": "40 TTC MFI & DOR 1MC 7IUIs", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519510008, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zzxwp/endometrial_scratch/", "id": "7zzxwp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7zzxwp/endometrial_scratch/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "kyfpz1GcYaazbx0Z2Frbjk4vsbIH7Cdb_ifde_AWLrE", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/psu4YE0bzJWgPLn1ZRMGm3nLcwuit0Amer8m9eHmiOo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=dd0317bff469414e685443ab8f0f27a8", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/psu4YE0bzJWgPLn1ZRMGm3nLcwuit0Amer8m9eHmiOo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=0c6a1e09a6ee1181bb36382d7f729f2b", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/psu4YE0bzJWgPLn1ZRMGm3nLcwuit0Amer8m9eHmiOo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=9917288318a55b8650179d8224afa463", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/psu4YE0bzJWgPLn1ZRMGm3nLcwuit0Amer8m9eHmiOo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=22e92a0e3ded87c5ac85dfd59c0ed502", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/psu4YE0bzJWgPLn1ZRMGm3nLcwuit0Amer8m9eHmiOo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=c3a4b831afedba2c9c714fa69f3b2041", "width": 960}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/psu4YE0bzJWgPLn1ZRMGm3nLcwuit0Amer8m9eHmiOo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=fbf24bb700a651ce355090912bbe83ea", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 900, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/psu4YE0bzJWgPLn1ZRMGm3nLcwuit0Amer8m9eHmiOo.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;s=ee32468513611f1d2945ec6070b1109e", "width": 1600}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1519587546, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I saw the FertilityIQ article about it (https://www.fertilityiq.com/ivf/iui-success-rates-doubled-with-endometrial-scratch)  When was it done in your cycle for those that have done it, and when they say \"relatively painless\" are they serious, or it is more like a cramping situation?
