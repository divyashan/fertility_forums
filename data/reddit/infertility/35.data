I see lots of posts on \"shitty 2016\" and I can't really post and respond, cause even though there have been crappy parts to 2016, overall I feel 2016 was pretty good. So on the off chance anyone else is in the same position, here's my \"things are ok\" thread (and I know that when one is in a bad mood one cares not for positive things so if I'm the only one in here that's ok too, maybe I just want to express my \"I'm ok mood\" lol)\n\nSo, this is what my 2016 was:\n\nShitty start with IF diagnosis\n\nDownright horrific surgery experience to treat stage I endometrioses\n\nSurgery did not help fertility or the pain\n\nMy husband and I built large planter boxes to line the fence in our backyard\n\nWe planted and harvested and amazing garden this summer\n\nWe have become so much closer and communicate so much better\n\nMade my first few quilt sales on my etsy site\n\nHad a few amazing weekends out at some friends' cabins out in the bush on the lake during the summer\n\nWent to the Great Canadian Kayaking Festival with a good friend\n\nOh! Went to the Yukon to present some research at the Canadian Archaeological Association (CAA) Conference \n\nBrought my husband with me to the Yukon and extended the trip to be a little vacation \n\nSet up a pretty sweet bird space in the backyard to attract birds and birdwatch  (this has been surpringly beautiful, relaxing, and fun)\n\nStarted my 4th and final year of my undergraduate degree\n\nStarted my thesis/research\n\nApplied for NSERC (federal funding for natural sciences Masters research)\n\nApplied to grad school  (masters degree)\n\nPainted the kitchen and it looks amazing!\n\nMade the President's List at my university (average of 90%+)\n\n\nSo what am I looking forward to in 2017? So much! However I now make the distinction between my 2017 goals (things I can achieve with hard work, like schooling and gardening) and my wishes (things I really want but have no control over like motherhood and pregnancy).\n\nReceive my Bachelor of Science\n\nReceive my Certificate of Indigenous Learning\n\nStart my Masters research\n\nImprove my garden and harvesting/preserving techniques \n\nMake more sales on my etsy site\n\nPresent my research findings at the CAA conference in May\n\nImprove my knowledge and application of traditional medicine \n\nBe an active member of my community, use the knowledge I have built up over the last several years to help people in my community\n\nGet my feet wet in publishing an article in a peer reviewed scientific journal \n\nI *wish* that 2017 will be the year that my husband and I will conceive and bring forth a child that we can raise and watch grow, but I leave it as a wish not a goal, because it's not a matter of how hard I work at it and it's unfair to beat myself up about it if I haven't achieved it by the end of 2017. Instead I will focus on things that I can control and that I can derive satisfaction and pride from (like schooling, birdwatching, quilting, cooking, violin, or learning Russian). We will keep doing the things required to conceive a child, but for now it will stay in the realm of \"natural\" cause since the horrific surgery I just feel like my body needs rest from medical instruments and poking and proding. I might change my mind throughout the comming year, but for now I'm just gonna go with the flow and see what things and opportunities (baby or otherwise) come our way on 2017.\n\nLong story short, I needed a space to say \"I'm ok, things are ok\". Infertility sucks and it's awful, but right now I feel like I'm so much more than \"just barren\" and that overall I'm happy. :) Thank you 2016 for reminding me to keep my gaze broad and bringing some good things my way to help soften the blow of infertility.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some good stuff", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5l62rx/some_good_stuff/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1483135340, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5l6499/pros_and_cons/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5l6499", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 25, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5l6499/pros_and_cons/", "retrieved_on": 1484458106, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "What was good this week?

TLDR: experience trying naturally after tube removal? Cautions or risks I should know about?\n\nI wanted to reach out and see if anyone had experience/opinions or information from their doctors on trying to conceive after ectopic.  I lost my left tube last week.  I did not take methotrexate so as far as I know there is no waiting period beyond healing.   My question/solicitation for feedback comes from my RE telling me it would be highly likely I will have another ectopic if I conceive.  I don't know if he's just the \"doesn't sugar coat it type\" or being overly cautious or not...or if something about my personal situation warrants more caution.   He told me he now considers me a \"tubal disorder\" patient as well as an ovulation disorder patient.  \n\n\nI had a cyst removed from my right (remaining) tube in September and during that surgery he found no endo, abnormalities, etc - both tubes were dye tested and open.  Even with the cyst the right tube was flowing dye.  He did find scarring in my abdomen...he told me it was not near my pelvis but he said sometimes that extensive of scarring could have been causing some issues.  The scarring was unexplained but possibly related to a hernia surgery I had as a toddler.   So he tells me that my right tube might have some issue and it has also been operated on so I'm at \"very high risk\" for another ectopic.  At first he said it would not be wise to continue trying.  Then he told me later that day that he would take care of me whatever we decide and if we conceive again.  Oh and I should also mention after removing the tube, he found two small spots of endo behind it.  Did this cause the ectopic?  Do I have more widespread endo that was not seen before? \n\n\n\n\n  I don't feel done trying to conceive but we are done with treatments. We can't afford ivf and I'm not sure that is the right choice for us anyway.  We did not want to pursue other IUI or ovulation induction either.  So this would really be trying on our own.  Thoughts?  Is it really risky?  I should also mention my right ovary is lazy and I have not made a single follicle on that side since the surgery in sept.  How common is it for the opposite tube to catch an egg?  Does that increase the chance that it will implant in the wrong place? (Abdomen or something?).

Hello to the men in here too, there just weren't any in the chat. \nI'm 38 (close to 39), husband is 42 and we started trying to get pregnant just over 2 years ago.  I became pregnant after only a few months of trying.  At 24 weeks (Aug/2015), I lost my mucus plug, spent 3 days in the hospital on bedrest and gave birth to my daughter via emergency c-section at 24 weeks and 3 days because of cervical incompetence.  After a 2 week stay in the NICU that came with extensive medical challenges, we decided to withdraw care and said goodbye to our baby girl.  \nWe decided to start trying again about 6 months later (Feb 2016) and had a chemical in July.  Since then we've been to an RE, have done two cycles of IUI with Femara with no luck getting pregnant.  After this last cycle, we decided to be aggressive with next steps and move to IVF.  \nI am currently on birth control.  At the last follicle check on Thursday, I have a cyst which means birth control for longer before I start stimming.  If the cyst goes away, the plan is to start stimming meds around 1/14.  This will be determined at our next appt in about a week.  \nWe decided to go the PGS route to limit the possibility of transfer of an abnormal embryo but I'm not quite ready to think about what's going to come next. Have to get through all the other stuff first... one step at a time. \nThanks to everyone for being so awesome already.  It's nice to know there's such great support here if needed.

I ovulate every cycle (confirmed by temping,OPKs and a day 21 progesterone). My cycles range from 26 days to 34 days. I ovulate around day 16 although CD1 can be hard to pinpoint because every cycle I spot up until my period.\nI start spotting between 4-6DPO and keep spotting until my full flow. The spotting gets worse - sometimes with red blood and clots, then usually gets light again for a day, then my period starts.\n\n.\n\nMy GP was concerned enough to send me to a fertility specialist. My ultrasound and all my day 3 hormone tests (inc AMH) were within range (as are my hubbys SAs). So I currently have no answers. The fertility specialist put me on the waitlist for a hysteroscopy and laparoscopy which should take about 4 months (they are funded here). In the meantime I am just driving myself crazy. I asked the Dr about potential treatment if they don't find anything but she seemed unwilling to talk about it until we had the surgery results... fertility treatment would not be funded so it is all out of pocket for us.\n\n.\n\nIs there anyone here who has had a similar situation? What are the treatment options in this case? Can medication help even if my hormone levels are normal? Is it worth experimenting with Vitex, supplements etc in the meantime? (I currently only take B6). I am feeling desperate.\n\n.\n\nI'm sorry if these questions seem premature and/or stupid. I am just so sick of hanging out on the TTC board where people call it baby dancing and announce their pregnancies every 2 minutes. In my house it's now, *oh fuck, we have to have SEX again* and I don't even get to test because I'm bleeding most of my luteal phase (I have just started a new Reddit account to move on from all of that shit. New Year and all that!)\n\n.\n\nNow that I have officially renamed my baby saving bank account to 'fertility treatment savings' I feel like I belong here, rather than there.

I've been lurking forever, but I am new to reddit and also somewhat new to IF. My husband and I have been trying for over a year and I'm going to share our story. \n\nLast September we got the full workup done. I checked out OK, but husband had a 1% morphology on his SA. All other parameters were average. The doctor suggested a test wash---if the results were OK, she recommended IUI. If the wash outcome was poor, she recommended straight to IVF.\n\nHusband and I decided to instead make some lifestyle changes --- cut back on alcohol, switched from briefs to boxers, and he started taking vitamins. Three months later we repeated the SA, and his total count and motility and total motile sperm increased (\"excellent\" was the RE's word), but morphology only went from 1% to 2%. \n\nNow we sit here with choice paralysis. Do we try naturally for a while with the new numbers? Try IUI (the test wash had \"good\" results, per the RE), or just still go straight to IVF? The cost is a huge factor and we have 0 insurance coverage. We are still \"young\" at 31 years old.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else had improvement of their MFI and if so, what they decided to do moving forward. Or any thoughts about the IUI or IVF numbers game. Part of us wants to jump right to IVF, but we aren't sure how to play the odds and maximize our dollars spent. Some people say they wish they had gone straight to IVF in the beginning, others say IUI can work and is valuable. (For a cost frame of reference, we were quoted about $1800 per medicated IUI vs $20k flat for the 6 cycle or money-back IVF guarantee at our clinic.) \n\nI am also getting completely overwhelmed by the appointment schedule. I am a nurse, and I do not have a flexible job or the ability to take any time off of days I'm working for an appointment. (If I am scheduled to work, I can't just leave for an hour to have an ultrasound, e.g.) Any nurses out there, or people who also have extremely inflexible jobs or work schedules, have recommendations or tips on how to schedule? I'd rather not involve my boss, but my schedule is set for the next 2 months, and looking at the calendar caused a major meltdown. How can you even guess when you will need these appointments, and how many of them? Obviously, it's worth it for a shot at a baby, but do you put your lives/plans on hold for a bit when you start cycles? Is it more flexible than it seems and I'm overreacting?\n\nThanks for reading our story and for any advice. I figured I would stop asking these questions of myself and pose them here.

I thought I would introduce myself. \n\nI'm 30, my husband is 35. Almost two years ago I made him move to the suburbs because we were about to start trying, our lease was ending, and I \"didn't want to have to move when pregnant.\" Holy fuck I was such an asshole. We tried for over a year with the temping and the charting and the OPKs before finally seeing an RE. Waiting that log was almost as bad a call as my genius decision to prematurely move to the 'burbs. The amount I spent on pregnancy tests alone could have funded a non-injectable IUI. \n\nI had to switch clinics after my HSG because my first clinic lied to me about some blood work and were going to have me do a medicated IUI despite not actually testing the 18 vials of blood they took from me (and even though they told me they did!) I'm much happier with my current RE and thankful the switch happened early on in the process. \n\nEventually we were diagnosed with a prolactinoma (me) and mild MFI (my husband (obviously), whose count and morphology has hovered at or below normal). My prolactin levels dropped dramatically after I started taking dostinex, which is a good thing except that dostinex is a borderline war crime. I have all of the terrible side effects - Nausea! Vomiting! Dizziness! Headaches! - and none of the good ones, i.e. weight loss and unusual sexual urges. \n\nAfter a couple of unsuccessful IUIs, I'm now on day 3 of stims for my first IVF cycle. It's not as bad as I expected, but I'm really terrified of feeling my ovaries and suspect I'm on the precipice of that experience. I did have one minor breakdown on day 1 thanks to Freedom sending me the wrong needles for my Menopur. Instead of sending me 27g .5in needles for my injections, they just sent me an extra bag of 22g 1.5in ones. After screaming \"THESE ARE NEEDLES FOR GIANTS BUT IM JUST A PERSON\" at my husband for a few minutes, we realized what happened and I calmed my body down. I used the needle from my trigger for day 1, and spent New Year's Day finding a pharmacy that was open so I could beg for needles. Fun!\n\nAnyway, I had my first monitoring appointment this morning. The doctor (not my typical RE) was pretty vague but did say I was responding well, so we'll see how this afternoon's call goes. \n\nWe haven't told anyone about our infertility. I'm somewhat irrational about thinking people are pitying me, and since almost everyone we know had a baby or got pregnant in 2016 (including both my sisters), it just seems easier this way. Thankfully we haven't gotten too many questions or comments about reproducing - I'm an attorney in a big firm, so I'm pretty sure most people assume that we haven't had kids because I'm a horrible career lady. But that's all to say that, having almost no support network, it's been really helpful to have this forum to read (and, now, hopefully participate in). \n\nTL;DR, thanks for all the help you have unknowingly given me, will take any and all advice for IVF first-timers and also tell me the truth is being conscious of your ovaries super creepy?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "An overly long introduction.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5lm1xc/an_overly_long_introduction/"}, {"author": "sciencejoy", "author_created_utc": 1469549190, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "35F DOR & MFI IVF2 CP FET #1", "author_fullname": "t2_ztqps", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1483378242, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5lmdos/chemical_pregnancy_to_start_the_new_year/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5lmdos", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 50, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5lmdos/chemical_pregnancy_to_start_the_new_year/", "retrieved_on": 1489393186, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Fuck.

I'm so happy to have found you all after thinking all I'd find on internet forums was b**y dust and dancing beans, or whatever.\n\nI'm 36 and my husband (38, good junk) and I have been officially trying for about 18 months - we literally got pregnant on our first try in March 2015 (really not even trying, just not preventing) and then I miscarried at 6.5 weeks, after telling our parents and his siblings (jesus, so naive). Have not been able to get pregnant since. Started seeing an RE about a year ago, diagnosed w/DOR, AMH 0.16, but day 3 FSH all over the map - as low as 5.6 and high as 20.2. Probably also some luteal phase defect - I was already freaking out before we started trying because my cycles were super short without supplemental progesterone.\n\nInsurance doesn't cover injectables, IUI, or IVF, but I've gotten some injectables here and there either donated (gonal-f) or paid out of pocket (ovidrel), plus letrozole, metformin, and oral progesterone. Plus so many stupid supplements - I'm starting to get angry every time I take another goddamned prenatal multi. Lots of bloodwork and ultrasounds and phone calls telling us when to have sex, followed up by phone calls telling me I'm not pregnant. We're trying to quickly pay down some existing debt &amp; explore options for insurance (my employer is actually considering adding coverage!) before deciding on next steps. We've actually been taking a break for a few months in an attempt to avoid holiday meltdowns. Failed on that - of course I get my period on Thanksgiving weekend. And Christmas weekend. \n\nNow I've been bleeding for 12 days straight since my period. Days 5 through 12 have ranged from spotting up to a light-day period level. I'm having intermittent sharp pain on my right side - not severe, more distressing mentally than physically. Went to the ER on Friday night convinced I had appendicitis but they ruled that out along with pregnancy (duh) and told me I had a bladder infection (yay) and to follow up with my doctor about the bleeding (everyone's off today). \n\nSo I'm thinking, maybe a ruptured cyst? But my (seriously amazing) acupuncturist, who responds to emails, says it doesn't sound like a cyst, I shouldn't be bleeding this much, and to get it checked out ASAP. Which will have to be tomorrow or Wednesday unless the pain or bleeding get bad enough to go back to the ER. Ugh.\n\nAny ideas or general commiserating welcome.\n\n*Edited to add:\n\nUPDATE: I decided to just go to my RE's office this morning since they start seeing patients at 6:30 but don't answer the phone until 9. They did bloodwork and ultrasound and found a 44mm cyst on my right side, a smaller one on the left. So that explains the abdominal discomfort. Bloodwork confirmed I'm not pregnant, so no ectopic. Bleeding still seems somewhat unexplained but they told me to stop taking any meds and come back in a week.\n\nThanks to everyone for the welcome and replies!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "introduction, and the 12 days of Christmas (bleeding)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5lmhc4/introduction_and_the_12_days_of_christmas_bleeding/"}, {"author": "mpourdes", "author_created_utc": 1382042570, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "34f - 2 IUIs - 4 IVFs - 1 FET - 1 CP and 1 MC", "author_fullname": "t2_dju31", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1483379378, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1483379694, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5lmhnt/turns_out_mother_in_law_who_is_against_ivf_is/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5lmhnt", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 64, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5lmhnt/turns_out_mother_in_law_who_is_against_ivf_is/", "retrieved_on": 1489393240, "score": 37, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So my mother in law (who is against IVF for religious reasons btw) came over to celebrate new year's eve.

So this might be a rant, but really it's also a testament to the love and support this group provides to us in a world/society that is anything but.\n\nI've been pondering this since I went to get a PAP from an RN and she was rude. Insinuating that my Dr's were either unethical and overstimulated me, or I was unethical by having (potentially) extra embryos after we complete our family (still trying for our first BTW). Why are women such bitches to each other?\n\nNow I know it's not JUST women who suck when it comes to IF- but I'm thinking even more globally. Women are damned if we do and damned if we don't on everything- especially anything to do with birthing or rearing children. \n\nAs all my fiends have lapped me more than once on the making of tiny humans, my Facebook newsfeed has been \"woah is the mommy wars\" for awhile now. But today a women posted a link in my Resolve community to a blogger complaining about how hard secondary infertility is because you aren't infertile enough for the infertile crowd. It made me so angry that this women felt she didn't fit in with other mothers (because she used a GC) or infertiles (because she had been successful) and she had to suffer through it alone.\n\nBut then I realized my own dr had just done a similar thing to me at our FET baseline appointment. She was trying to give me the odds of this transfer working, but in doing so she also minimized my infertility. It went like this:\n\n\"Well since you're not doing IVF because of an infertility diagnosis, and JUST tubal issues, your chances are probably even higher!\"\n\nBut if I don't have tubes, am I not infertile? I mean I get what she meant. No egg quality or sperm issues, but still. It stings to feel like you haven't suffered enough to belong, but suffered more than enough so you cannot be blissfully ignorant either.\n\nI know it's hard to find the right things to say sometimes when we are dealing with this shit, AND we are hopped up on hormones and may be more affected by offhanded remarks, but I still hate this women on women hate in today's society. Everything is a competition and its every woman for themselves instead of all women working together to raise all women up.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what I wanted to accomplish with this post, other then to vent it out. But I am so happy that we never try to one up each other with the pain olympics, or kick people out because they are ONLY on step x of treatment or don't fit a specific type/diagnosis of infertility.

I felt like a ticking time bomb ready to explore with *all the emotions*. I was okay, holding it together, then I called the nurse and burst into tears halfway through my voicemail. I hung up and just lost it. Pulled myself together for about 10 minutes before she called me back and I burst into tears again. That woman was too kind. I'm so thankful for her. I told her we couldn't afford IVF, so she said she'd call back after the RE reviewed my plan. \n\nHe's letting me do one more IUI. I get one more shot at this.

Due to the serious and important nature of this topic I felt these thoughts warranted a post. \n\nPart I:\n\nI am a survivor of sexual abuse. Back in my younger years I had a bf that got whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. This went on for years before I left and it was a difficult and painful time. Although this happened 10-15 years ago it's the kind of thing that sticks with you no matter how much healing and forgiving you do. Scars are scars and that's how it is.\n\nNow, every test, PAP, internal ultrasound, every procedure is a vivid reminder of that abuse. It's a thing every survivor deals with. The rest of the time you can be 110% fine, life is great, you've healed, your partner is great and caring, you never think about it anymore, never crosses your mind. But as soon as you get on that gurney, it all comes right back. Usually you just do what you gotta do to get through your yearly (or whatever) PAP test and move on. But with infertility everything is all about your reproductive organs. Everyone is all of a sudden interested in your vagina and now it's no longer a once a year thing you have to power through, but a constant thing! It's difficult! Not only are you dealing with the complexe emotions of infertility, but you are constantly bombarded by those feelings of helplessness where something is happening that hurts and you don't like, but you have \"no choice\" but to just grin and bare it (simply put, but you get the point I hope). There is a hidden yet heavy toll to pay when you are a rape survivor going through infertility.\n\nIf you are also a survivor going through this, just know that I feel you, I get it. You're not the only one and it's ok to take breaks to ensure your emotional health and sanity through it all. Also don't underestimate the help that professional counseling can provide, and if you don't like your current one, switch to a different counselor that will help you feel safer and that helps. Feeling safe is the most important need for survivors.\n\n\nAnd on that note, Part II:\n\nThis may be controversial, but I am standing firmly behind it. I hate to refer to specific genders here but I will for clarity, just know that this can go either way.\n\nIt is not ok to force your partner into fertility treatments.  Period! \n\nIt is NOT ok to guilt a woman into submitting to medical procedures. Her body is HERS. It is her choice and her RIGHT to choose what happens to her body; and if she is not ok with something happening to it, be it IUI, IVF, or just plain sex, then NO means NO. It does not make her a bad wife. It does not mean she doesn't want kids bad enough. It means she is not comfortable with submitting her body to the procedure. That is her decision and even if you as her partner think that the procedure is no big deal, she is allowed to feel differently, and that needs to be respected. \n\nI'm lucky enough to have a husband who is completely respectful of my decisions regarding my body. If he disagrees/it affects him, we discuss it at length when I am ready. We openly discuss my reasoning, his thoughts and feelings about it, and we discuss alternatives and options. We also discuss the possibility that I might change my mind in the future. Never does he judge or criticize my reasoning. We seek only to understand where the other is comming from, not to \"change their mind\". We work as a team, both being respectful of each other and our needs and feelings.\n\nIt is my strong hope that everyone in this sub has respectful partners who respect them and their choices. I truly hope that no one here has been guilted into submitting to anything they did not want to do!  And if you were, I hope you and your partner can sit down and discuss it together and get back to a healthy respectful place.\n\nAgain, just cause IVF or IUI is a medical procedure doesn't mean it's ok to guilt a woman into it! It's not ok to guilt someone into sex, why would guilting them into invasive sexual medical procedures be ok?! \n\nThat's my stance on the matter. As always I am open to respectful discussion and comments. I apologize if this may have been a trigger to anyone, my intent was only to bring up a topic that is rarely discussed but I feel has become pertinent in the subreddit.

(Both my PT and his assistant have pregnant wives...that's been \"fun\" but I'm dealing with it). And another lady in there, who barely knows them and didn't know that, started joking about how \"it's ok, next year he'll be up cause he'll never get good sleep again.\" And then went ON AND ON about how \"having a child is a life sentence of no sleep\"...kept saying things like \"Even when they grow up! Shoot I worry more now cause I can't control them at all.\"\n\nSHUT UP LADY. Your jokes are bad and you should feel bad. \n\nI despise when people, even jokingly, talk about parenting like it sucks. Yeah, I imagine it is hard. I imagine you do miss some sleep sometimes. But I know plenty of parents who get plenty of sleep. And I would kill/give a body part/etc to have that problem. I'd love to not have to IMAGINE it. So argh.\n\n**Two** My bowling league organizer sent an email reminder about January signups/start date/etc. A lengthy email full of necessary info. In reply (there was no need for ANYONE to reply ALL) someone sent a picture *of their newborn* with jokes about how the baby is ready to be a sub if anyone needs one. AHHHH.  Like, this was a 2 week old baby (how do I know? Oh, yeah...cause they sent a fucking announcement to the bowling league list 2 weeks ago....like we care?).\n\nFirst of all, don't reply all. There are ~100 people in our bowling league -- maybe you personally know 15 of them??  The other 75 of us don't care one tiny bit about your baby. And its 1000% off topic so it wasn't needed. I hate people who don't know how to \"reply all\" correctly and those who go off topic and start tangent threads inside useful, important ones. But I especially hate it when I open a BOWLING email and have a newborn picture in my face!!\n\n**Three** A doctor at the orthopedics place saw me checking out. He's super friendly and great and we usually chat. He asked how I was doing and I kind of blandly said \"Ok and how are you?\"  He goes \"Only ok? Whats wrong? Is your knee not doing well?\"  And I told him my knee was fine. He then asked me why I was melancholy. I kinda brushed it off but he said again \"No no, you can tell me...I don't like seeing you like this!\"........so I told him \"I just had my 5th pregnancy loss and I'm just not feeling well emotionally.\".  ARGH - I didn't *care* to bring it up right then. \n\nAND THEN his response was sweet but still annoying. So it turned into a whole thing. Sigh.

I've been lurking but this is my first post. I turn 36 today and got my period this morning. Feeling pretty discouraged. \n\nI've told a few close friends and family members about what we're going through, but I've found it hard to build a real support network and am feeling a bit ungrounded. Even some of my best friends seem sort of at a loss for what to say or how to support. I'm not sure what to tell them, and I don't blame them, but I feel pretty alone. \n\nWe've been actively trying for just over a year, monitoring temps and CM and CP and OPKs, acupuncture, supplements, mayan massage, etc - but I've wanted and waited for this for many years before so I guess it feels like longer. I was with the same partner all through my 20s and a few months after he told me he was finally ready for a baby he left me. I was devastated, and although I'm in a much healthier, happier relationship now and grateful for it, that experience still introduced pain into this space for me, and it was a delicate space to enter again with my current partner and it took many years to get here. \n\nSo here we are, much later in life than I'd hoped to be trying for my first, but still I'm thankful to have gotten to this place with my wonderful partner and to be finally financially stable enough and have good enough insurance to get some help. \n\nI've had basic blood testing and everything seems okay except my progesterone, which is low but still indicates ovulation (7.1 at 7DPO). My luteal phase is marginal (10-11 days), but not short enough to concern my doctor. Well, both of those things concern me, but not my doctor. SA results were good. \n\nWhat is weird is that I tracked my period (without temping) for 2 years before we started trying to conceive, and every cycle was 29 or 30 days. Since we started trying, my cycles have been from 33-38 days. Literally from the first time we tried. Paired with my low progesterone, I'm wondering if I'm having super early miscarriages every month. Again, my doctor is just like, those cycles are a little long but fine. I've never gotten a positive pregnancy test, but I only recently learned that very faint lines count, so I very well could be having regular chemicals. I don't know for sure, but I don't have another explanation. \n\nMy doctor has offered Clomid and IUI, but it feels like a pretty generic stab in the dark. I'll probably try at least the Clomid for a few cycles and see where it goes. We'll never be able to afford IVF, but I do have coverage for IUI - though I'm not sure if there's any point in that since my partner's SA was good. \n\nWhen we started trying to get pregnant I stopped taking meds for anxiety and depression, so that may be a variable as well. I think I've been handling it okay, but the meds did have a huge positive impact on my quality of life, so it has been a struggle adjusting to not having them. My doctor thinks I should start them again, but I don't know. Maybe depends on how far the path of interventions we get - I also have some past sexual trauma that makes me anxious about IUI, etc - so far I've turned down an HSG and they've been okay with that since I don't have any risk factors. I did used to have an IUD that -in addition to a very painful insertion experience- gave me terrible cramps for 6 months until I took it out. Otherwise I've not used hormonal birth control in probably 10 years. \n\nAnyway, that's my long rambling introduction. Any advice or words of encouragement welcomed.

The nurses are saying the RE will do whatever I want - that I can go back on a different pill and delay and hopefully no side effects, wait another cycle and get an insurance extension which will take another 3 weeks and not go on the pill, go forward as is. Do I have a valid concern that I might have to miss this wedding if I'm feeling awful, or is there a chance that I'd be doing an egg retrieval that weekend? I'd likely be at least a week deep in an antagonist stims cycle by the time the wedding comes around.

Sorry for the long explanation to follow:\n\nGot pregnant in 2015 after trying for about six months. Was tracking and everything looked good, my cycles have always been very regular, my luteal phase was a bit short but not too bad. Anyway, got pregnant, almost never stopped bleeding and cramping through the pregnancy, but we had a heartbeat and no signs of anything wrong, until I miscarried very abruptly at 11w4d after a particularly bleedy week at the end of 2015.\n\nStarted trying again a couple months later, trying to keep it casual to avoid it being too gutwrenching after what we went through, so I didn't track for the first few months, just guessed based on prior data. No successes, so I started tracking again and noticed I wasn't getting reliable temp spikes anymore. My cycle was still as regular and consistent as it gets, though. Talked to doctor in Sept, he did the CD21 progesterone test and it was 8.6(ng/mL), did it again in October and it was 5.7(ng/mL). Started clomid 50mg, that was 8.0(ng/mL). Got on 100mg, and finally got a 11.2(ng/mL) on Friday.\n\nSo, all this to ask, how can they tell the difference between a low progesterone issue and an ovulating issue? I feel confused about the fact that you can set your watch to my cycles, but I'm not ovulating according to progesterone tests... but low progesterone is also a very common cause of miscarriages, isn't it? Is it possible that I am ovulating, but not making enough progesterone to hold onto any potential pregnancies? I always suspected it was the cause of my MC last year based on the fact that I bled so much, though I have no idea if that's actually true or just an idea I got in my head, I'm working on getting the labs from the clinic I was seeing during my pregnancy.\n\nI hope this makes sense. I probably have a huge misunderstanding about the mechanism of progesterone and fertility, and that's what I'm seeking to understand so that I can stop feeling like we're not doing everything possible.

And it came with twisting back pain. Those two things could mean most anything - that I'm 39 and in perimenopause, for instance, or that I slept wrong, or that I was working too hard at Christmas. Whatever. But I noticed the signs. I marked them down, to myself.\n\nChristmas came and went, and I thought about it. I thought - I bet this is it. I posed for pictures with my family, thinking about one day saying to someone, see? You were there. We just didn't know it yet.\n\nWe went to Las Vegas. On the plane a baby sat in front of me, arms waving like a little anemone, and hours later, after we arrived at the house and I was going through my shoulder bag looking for tip money, I pulled out a pink rubber pacifier. Surprised, I laughed aloud. The baby had dropped it, and I'd carried it away. In the same moment that I knew it was just a coincidence, I also decided it was a sign. I resolved to keep it, if my suspicions were right. To wash it off. See? I imagined explaining to someone, later. Pointing to it in the bourgeois display cabinet where we keep silly things and curiosities. Know where I got that? Fate, that's where.\n\nI decided to drink as much as I usually would on this vacation, because after all, I didn't officially know anything yet. And this would probably be my last chance. For how long. A year? Basically. Long enough, anyway. I smiled and cheersed with rum, and we took a picture around the table on New Year's Eve, all of dressed in our best and smiling big. My breasts look unusually lush in that picture. See? I imagined saying to someone, later. You can tell.\n\nWe went to Vegas instead of the tropics because one of us was planning to be pregnant then, and she was afraid of Zika. She wound up getting divorced instead. Wouldn't that be ironic, I thought to myself. I composed the email to her, in my mind. You're not going to believe this, but.... And then a picture of the stick.\n\nSo when my period due date came and went, I wasn't surprised. Nervous, maybe. Wow, I thought, was I right? The signs are all there. I felt different. Moods different. Soreness different. Absent, in fact. Waiting.\n\nAnother day came and went. We flew home. I wore a tight new sweater dress, and poked at my soft belly when in the airplane bathroom, sinking my finger into my flesh, through the fat to the gentle give of muscles underneath. What's in there? I wondered to myself. I tallied months up on my fingers. Arrival at the end of September, give or take. \n\nThat night, I fell asleep. I dreamt. I dreamt about peeing on the stick, and watching it, and the stick said \"yes\" (verbatim, which is not what they say, but that's what it said in the dream). I was happy. I was excited. Is this really it? I wondered to myself. Can this be real? But it wasn't real, because I was dreaming. I woke up, unsure. Still dark, but getting light. The stick was a dream. But I had one in the medicine cabinet. Should I take it?\n\nI didn't want to. I knew it had all been a dream. If it's true, I reasoned, it will be true if I use the stick or not. Same as if it's not true. I went back to bed.\n\nI woke up in deep, gnawing pain. All day, all last night, keeping me awake, and all today.\n\nI still feel it.\n\nMore pain than I anticipated. But I guess that's been true of this entire process.

She hadn't dated this guy all that long and I lived on the other side of the country at the time (and a few states away now). Both halves of this marriage have grown children, I've met a couple of his \"kids\" at the wedding and briefly a couple of other times. His daughter had friended me on Facebook a while ago, but we hadn't interacted at all. She has a 1 year old daughter that she posts about all the time, I've been very close to unfollowing her. \n\nStory: last night she messages me and said since she had her daughter (legs call her Jane) family means everything and she loves my mom and she would love to get to know me and I'm an aunt to Jane. I'm not sure how to respond at first... But I eventually say sure and give my brief life synopsis, leaving out infertility for the time. She gives me hers and I find out they got married in April after barely knowing each other and are pregnant in May. Go fucking figure. \n\nIt already bothers me a bit that my mom has talked about more grand babies and refers to Jane as her grand daughter. Maybe because this happened so late in my life, it's weird to think of them as a step family. I don't call him my dad or step dad or anything, he's my mom's husband. Now I have to figure out a way to deal with these emotions with a fertile step sister whom I feel stole the first grand kid from me, while trying to build a relationship with her? \n\nI don't know what to do, I'm leaning towards telling her what we're going through and that it's hard to deal with kid stuff at the moment I don't know though.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weird family situation", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5m6jr4/weird_family_situation/"}, {"author": "TenderJourney", "author_created_utc": 1483552732, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_1454sd", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1483636169, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5m7l0y/fet/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5m7l0y", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 30, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5m7l0y/fet/", "retrieved_on": 1489403630, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "We have our first FET coming up after a failed fresh.

As someone who is about to go into her 4th run, i'm here to say it's not as bad as you think. Yes, I will concede that the financials can be as bad as you think, unless the IVF fairy visits you and puts a certificate for a free cycle under your pillow. However, the actual process seems SO SCARY, but once you get in it it's doable. You get into a routine and just do it, because you have your eyes on the prize. If you're scared of shots, get help from your partner or friends/family. Write everything down in a calendar/list if you're worried about forgetting stuff. Have supplies ready for those days when you know you might have a meltdown. If you're comfortable, tell someone what you're going through. Heck, even get a therapist if you can. Yes, there is a lot of uncertainty. You might have a super easy retrieval, not make it to retrieval, or have OHSS/other complications. There are a lot of things that need to work to make it to transfer. But I promise that when you're in it, you are stronger then you think. There is no special quality I possess that has gotten me through it, other than my desire for a baby. I just keep moving with the hopes that it'll work out someday. \n\n\nI'd also like to say that if you choose NOT to do IVF, that you are not any less brave. Making the choice that is right for you even when other people are telling you what they think you should do is pretty brave in my book.\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "IVF: it's not as bad as you think.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5megb8/ivf_its_not_as_bad_as_you_think/"}, {"author": "LittleSusySunshine", "author_created_utc": 1423450578, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_l8u60", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1483723078, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1483743055, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5mes9a/czech_ivfde_info/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5mes9a", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 30, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5mes9a/czech_ivfde_info/", "retrieved_on": 1489407179, "score": 19, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I know there's been some increased interest in overseas IVF/DE treatments, so I thought I'd share some of my info about cycling in the Czech Republic.\n\nIVF and DE are both very cheap in the Czech Republic. Everything is cheap in the Czech Republic, honestly, and it's a wonderful country with beautiful towns and cities to visit and friendly people. It depends on the clinic, of course, but OE IVF will be somewhere around $2000 (plus meds). A donor egg cycle will be around $5000. PGS depends, but is around $350 per embryo. Most clinics offer a guarantee that's something of 2 high-quality embryos at day 3 or 5, many include an additional guarantee of a discounted or free cycle if the first 2 don't work.\n\nThey don't have an official organization like SART to report to, and because many of their clients are overseas and therefore aren't around for continuing care to report things like ongoing pregnancies. Clinics will give success rates on their websites, but those aren't always complete information - for better or for worse.\n\nYou can do either own egg or donor egg in the Czech Republic. The three most popular clinics are Gennet (Prague), Reprofit (Brno), and Zlin (Zlin). There are multiple others, those are just the most popular at the moment.\n\nOwn egg is more popular for women in Europe (mostly UK) because the flights and travel time are much easier. Zlin, for instance, last I heard - requires that you be there for the entire cycle time - so 3 weeks. Otherwise you'd need to plan to be there for about 10 days, depending on what kind of transfer you want.\n\nIf you're going just for a transfer, you could technically do it in as little as 4 days from the US: 2 days to get there, one day for transfer, one day to get back - but that would be pretty hectic and require everything to go perfectly with your lining and cycle.\n\nDonor egg is very popular. Brno and Zlin are both university towns, so there's a large population of young donors. Reprofit also has double donor embryos - not donated, but created and available on-hand ($1100 per embryo untested, $1500 per embryo tested). If you're using your partner's sperm, I'd recommend scheduling it so you can leave at least one frozen sample in case you have to do another cycle. \n\nDonors are stimmed gently there - they'll usually end up with about 8 eggs, and between 2-4 embryos. I'd say 2 is more common.\n\nYou can order meds overseas. There is a chance they'll get hung up in customs, but that has not happened to me. UK pharmacies will fill off a Czech prescription, US pharmacies won't. I bought a lot of extra meds when I was over there for a transfer and that has been helpful when I required more than one cycle.\n\nIt's easiest if you have a doctor here who's on board. Most RE clinics will do \"outside monitoring\" - that is, they'll do your ultrasounds and blood tests and send over the reports, but they won't prescribe meds. You can order a lot of your own blood tests through a service like walkinlab.com. That is all out of pocket. I found my OB/GYN has been more helpful than my RE.\n\nCzech law does not allow transfers for same-sex couples or single women, but you can have anyone be your \"partner.\" They just need to have forms signed and notarized here and bring a copy of their passport - they don't have to come.\n\nCzech law also does not allow for gender selection. Transfers can be done up until a woman's 49th or 50th birthday (there is some conflict about this, so ask your clinic). \n\nAll donors are anonymous. You get age, height, weight, hair and eye color, and blood type. Some clinics will also give you details about course of study for students and hobbies or interests. Many clinics the doctors will choose for you, based on your stated preferences. Other places you might be offered a choice.\n\nClinics are clean and modern. I went to CCRM before we cycled in CZ, and I find them perfectly equivalent.\n\nTravel is long, but not too complicated. Many people in the Czech Republic speak good English. You'll have to take a connecting flight from the US (I think Delta might do a seasonal direct flight to Prague from NYC). For Prague, you can fly into the city. There is a small airport in Brno, but it's very easy for Brno and Zlin to fly into either Prague or Vienna and take a bus or train there. (StudentAgency.eu is a cheap and excellent bus service that leaves from baggage claim at the Vienna Airport and just across the parking lot at the Prague airport.) \n\nThe tricky part of travel is knowing far enough in advance when you're going to book a good flight, so your cycle will probably be manipulated to let you plan ahead. We've found it easiest to book frequent flyer tickets (if you don't have miles, watch for sales for your preferred airline where you can buy them - sometimes that's a good value, mostly if you're flying business or first class) because the change fees are much less. You can also follow travel blogs like The Points Guy who will let you know about airfare sales.\n\nPeople often use the cycle as a chance to travel, either while the embryos are cooking, or before or after transfer. Most popular places for a nearby getaway are Prague, Budapest, Vienna, and Czesky Krumlov.\n\nThere are a few coordinators who will help (for an additional fee). I have used Sue at IVF Traveler. There's also MyIVFAlternative.\n\nThe language barrier does exist, but it's relatively minor - their English is quite good. I find it easier to communicate in writing, as it removes the accent, but they will Skype with you for consultations and WTF appointments. \n\nThey are best at straightforward cases. If you have complicated what-if questions, it's helpful to have a doctor here and/or a coordinator, and to be willing to assemble things yourself. They will write orders for tests and ultrasounds and doctors here will usually accept those.\n\nWe haven't had success yet, but that is due to us and not to the clinics. I've been reading message boards (fertilityfriends.co.uk has the most active Czech communities) for almost two years and have seen lots of people have success.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or add to this if I've left anything major out.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Czech IVF/DE Info", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5mes9a/czech_ivfde_info/"}, {"author": "TheHearts", "author_created_utc": 1421926566, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "34, DOR, RPL/stillbirth, FET#2", "author_fullname": "t2_kvj9o", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1483724115, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5mew2a/website_for_meds_savings/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5mew2a", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5mew2a/website_for_meds_savings/", "retrieved_on": 1489407232, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I just wanted to share a website that may be of use - somebody sent it to me.

So, if this IUI doesn't work, she said I can choose to do a combo of oral and injectibles, but I should be mindful that it may become a cycle where I canNOT try for pregnancy because I may overproduce.

Maybe this is just my 1 am, can't sleep so I'm thinking of everything I've ever done wrong brain talking but do you ever feel \"ready\" for an IVF cycle?\n\nWe are planned to start priming  for our first round of IVF with my next cycle in about a week and the closer I get the more I have the urge to postpone and wait a month.

IVF is here!\"\n\nMaybe these are just the newbie nerves. I don't know. The only thing pushing me forward is my \"lovely\" DOR and the feeling like it's now or never.
