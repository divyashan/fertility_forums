It's been a rough couple of years with lots of ups and downs. I started my first year teaching last fall which was just as rough as everyone makes it out to be. Because of the newly acquired health insurance I decided to finally see a fertility specialist. It took me way to long but I finally got all of my tests done and had the follow up today. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo here is the condensed version:\n\n1. Both me and my husband are cancer survivors who went through chemotherapy.\n2. I have PCOS which should make things difficult obviously, but not impossible especially since I will have spells of regularity. I will often have a regular cycle for 2-5 months and then have no period for 3-5 more months.\n3. Both me and my husband have more than enough eggs/sperm and despite the PCOS, I can have a pretty regular cycles as mentioned above so I ovulate and can usually tell when I do.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo the long and short of it seems to be that we have quantity but not quality. Dr. told us there is no really easy way to see the genetic quality of the eggs/sperm and that the fact that we both went through chemo raises our risk of genetic problems. Basically she said that even with PCOS, because my cycle can be fairly regular the fact that I haven't gotten pregnant in over two years of trying especially at my age (25) points to an issue that is maybe more genetic. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe talked us through our IVF options but I don't know that I'm ready or want to go through that whole process and my husband is  on the same page. We feel like if we're going to be spending a lot of money on a baby, we would rather adopt. I had more or less come to terms with being infertile in preparation for this but my husband is taking it pretty hard. It kills me to see him so heart broken. He has always tried to remain positive but now that he's faced with actual medical evidence, he's having a hard time adjusting. \n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, hello ladies. I can't say I'm particularly happy to be a part of this group now, but I can say it's really nice to have a community to go to who can understand me and my situation. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello Infertility", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6hd3yw/hello_infertility/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "30yooldladythrowaway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497505305, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6hd4n9/first_hsg1_blocked_tube_second_hsgboth_open/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6hd4n9", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6hd4n9/first_hsg1_blocked_tube_second_hsgboth_open/", "retrieved_on": 1500143300, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Has anyone had this experience?\n\nMy first HSG was a horrifically painful experience, and showed one slow-fill blocked tube and one totally closed off.

Nevertheless, there is no significant difference in terms of clinical pregnancy between the GnRH antagonist and agonist cycles. The use of aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole was suggested by some studies.\n\nObjective:\nThe object of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of letrozole co-treatment with GnRH-antagonist protocol in ovarian stimulation of poor responder patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection.\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nA double-blinded randomized control trial was conducted on 70 infertile women with poor ovarian response based on Bologna criteria in two groups: letrozole+GnRH-antagonist (LA) group and placebo+GnRH-antagonist (PA) group (n=35/each). The LA group involved at letrozole 2.5 mg daily over 5 days and recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone 225 IU/daily. The PA group received placebo over 5 days and recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone at the same starting day and dose, similar to LA group.

I had my first RE appt yesterday, and while I was hoping the tests my OBGYN did (CD3, CD21, U/S, HSG) would have the RE saying 'Oh, you have PCOS? Let's get you on Clomid and get this show on the road!', it did not happen that way. \n\nHe was actually skeptical of the PCOS 'diagnosis' my obgyn gave me (she said its \"likely\" PCOS, so not really a diagnosis), and also skeptical of the bicornuate uterus diagnosis. Once I told him I had an 80 day cycle last cycle, he agreed I have some sort of ovulation dysfunction and that we need further tests to show its actually PCOS and not something different.\n\nFor the bicornuate uterus, he wants to make sure it is in fact bicornuate (heart-shaped), and not septate (something to do with the shape of the surrounding muscle, i guess?). Apparently this cannot be determined by a transvaginal ultrasound or the HSG, which sucks, because the radiologist told me there was no septum and I thought that was the end of it! The RE gave me the option of a laparoscopy or an MRI, of which I chose the MRI. I'm hoping he sees what he needs to, and that there's no reason to go forward with the surgery. If he sees a septate uterus or something else unexpected and the lap is necessary, I'll prepare for that, but right now I just don't want surgery!\n\nI go back on Monday for either CD3 blood work and U/S, or for no-period blood work and U/S (I'm on CD35 now). Then an MRI the following week, then a follow-up to discuss all the results the week after that. I'm so glad to have found this community to share with.

My TSH is 1.787 which is good (for now). I'll have to get it checked again as it is on the rise from my last level (0.2). So need to make sure it's levelled out as opposed to still going up. But at least for now, it's a good value. Onto my AMH, good news here too. The reason why I got that checked was because my last FSH was 13. So RE wanted to check AMH values. Mine is 1.4 which apparently isn't bad. Then we did the follicle count, cause why not, they're in there anyways. Got seven per side. Which apparently is in line with my AMH values more so my FSH. So that's all good news. Still got my big cyst on the left side but no additional asshole cysts on the right side (my left tube is partially blocked anyways so we care more about my right side). \n\nSo the doctor and I decided that we would do one more round of Femera (I had pretty good reaction last month with two follicles on my right side) and iui.  If this doesn't work (my third iui) then we will do one with injectables. After that, it's onto IVF. I feel good seeing as we have a whole plan laid out. I know when we are going to give up on iui and move on. So I have the next couple of months to mentally get there if this doesn't work out. \n\nThis being the third iui (as long as I get mature follicles on the right side) I feel like I'm slowly going insane. Or at least the definition of insanity - doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Or something like that. \n\nFor now, I'm going to take today as a win. I didn't get agonizing pain on Wednesday from my period (took some aleve at the appropriate time obviously), haven't had additional cyst pain this cycle (so far) and got good news this morning.

Side effects seem to be getting worse each time and I'm insanely worried whether I will even be able to finish this pack or if I'm now doing permanent damage.  I've only taken 2 of the pills so far and in addition to the usual nightly hyper-sweating, I'm having headaches with pressure behind my eyes, and this insanely uncomfortable tingling sensation that started in my left hand last night (it even woke me up from deep sleep) and has continued randomly throughout today and has gotten more constant tonight while also starting in my right hand.  I'm aware that parasthesia is a rare side effect of Clomid, but does this mean I should stop taking it and cancel this cycle?  Has anyone had this before and does it go away after stopping medication?\n\nThe 1st cycle, had no side effects aside from feeling a little odd/moody and night sweats, and I got pregnant but had a missed miscarriage.  Started back on Clomid about 4 months after the first cycle when my period finally came back, guess this gave some months for it to clear my system.  The first month back on after the MC, had no side effects aside from night sweats. The second month, I had mad night sweats every night and started to get headaches later in the day on day 4 and the day after I finished the last dose, I had a bad migraine and couldn't move my head and had to avoid bright light, had a continuing headache the next day, but then it all went away fairly fast. I recall also had one brief episode of one arm starting to go a little numb after day 5 but it went away and none of this tingling/prickly sensation.\n\nI'm absolutely terrified of this parasthesia becoming worse over the next THREE pills I still have left to take, as the full blow of the medication doesn't even seem to come until you've finished all 5 of them, and also getting another mega-migraine although now the parasthesia has me more freaked out. This is absolutely my **last** month on this, I even asked to switch to injectables this month because of last month's migraine but the clinic convinced me to give Clomid one more try due to it having worked the first time and because I respond so well to it at the minimum dose.

I've been lurking on Reddit for a while now and I finally thought it was time for me to post something. I am 35 (soon to be 36 in September) and my husband is 38. We've been trying to have a baby for 7 years. It's so crazy that I can say that! I get regular periods, I ovulate and my husband's sperm is A okay! I've used OPK's and other cycle charting methods along the way but had to stop for my own sanity. As you can imagine, I've been bingoed many times along this journey and gone through every emotion imaginable. \nHere's a little history about our situation (Since it's been 7 years, the dates may be off some. It's hard to remember the timeline for when everything happened.)\nMay 2010-Got off of Birth Control (I was 28 years old)\n\nJuly 2011-Got pregnant\n\nAugust 2011-Miscarried at 3 weeks\n\nAugust 2011-D&amp;C performed\n\nSeptember 2011-September 2012-Kept trying\n\nSeptember 2012-October 2013-Went to a Holistic and Alternative Medicine place hoping that they would be able to help me get pregnant. Took all of the supplements they told me to.\n\nDecember 2013-Saw an RE for the first time. He said I had fibroids  inside of my uterus and that I needed surgery. My husband was not keen on the idea of me having surgery, so we did not move forward with that.\n\nDecember 2013-December 2014-Went to an acupuncturist on and off, took herbs kept trying and praying that God will heal me and take away the fibroids. Acupuncture was not relaxing for me. Also, during this period I had an HSG at some point which hurt like hell times a 1,000,000. It was the worst pain I ever felt in my life. Even though it hurt, it showed that both tubes were clear.\n\nJanuary 2015-Went back to the RE and once again they said that I still had fibroids and it looked like I had more than the last time they checked. Of course, this is not what I wanted to hear as I was hoping the acupuncture had helped. My husband and I decided that I would have the fibroid surgery in the summer since I'm a teacher.\n\nJune 2015-Had a Myomectomy (Fibroid removal). Thank goodness they only had to make 4 small incisions on my stomach instead of a big incision. They took out 6 fibroids. I recovered well and was excited about being able to get pregnant now.\n\nSeptember 2015-I went in for my 3 month checkup, and the RE says he sees 2 more fibroids and recommends that I have them removed. I was shocked, confused and angry and I asked the RE how could I have 2 more fibroids already. He said that they could have been hiding and that sometimes having fibroids in the uterus can change the shape of your uterus.\n\nOctober 2015-Had a fibroid Hysteroscopy, which is a less invasive procedure. Instead of having to make incisions on my stomach, they were able to go through my vagina to remove the fibroids. After this surgery I decided that I wasn't having anymore more surgeries to remove fibroids. If they decide to come back, oh well. Now I have these lovely scars on my stomach as a badge of honor which can be seen when I wear a bathing suit.\n\nNovember 2015-February 2016-Tried to get pregnant as the doctor said this is a good time since my uterus has been cleaned out of fibroids. I tried Letrozole for 2 months with no success.\nFebruary 2016-June 2016-Kept trying and praying.\n\nJune 2016-My Dr. retires so they refer me to another one at the clinic. He orders an HSG since it had been a while since I had one. It hurt like hell just like last time and it show that 1 tube is blocked. I'm guessing that it's blocked from possible scar tissue I have from the fibroid surgeries.\n\nMarch 2016-May 2017-Kind of became numb to the whole infertility thing and somewhat gave up. We still tried to have sex around ovulation, but I was just tired of the hope that I had each month, only to be disappointed. I was trying to come to terms that I may never be a mother. I do not want to adopt as I really want to have my own biological children. Which some people don't understand because there are so many children that need adopting. \n\nMay 2017-Decided to do IVF. We had played around with this option before, but the cost was so overwhelming that I thought we would never be able to do it. I did not want to go into a huge amount of debt for it. In December 2016 my father was hit by a car and killed while he was blowing leaves in the front of his subdivision. From his death, we received enough money to do one round of IVF without having to finance it. \n\nJune 2017-Started my ever first IVF cycle on June 6. I decided to wait until the summer since I'm a teacher. I had the egg retrieval this past Friday. They retrieved 9 eggs, and out of those 9, 3 fertilized. Now we have to wait until Thursday to see how many make it to blastocyst. I know that IVF is no guarantee, but I really hope it's our time. It's been a long 7 years and I don't know how much more I can take. I'm being cautiously optimistic and realizing that it may not work, but I really feel like this is our time. I hope and pray it is. \n\nIf you've made it this far congratulations and thank you for reading my post! Thank you in advance for your words of encouragement.\n\n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6hzjou/introduction/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "LeDocteurNo", "author_created_utc": 1358289886, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_a8pjv", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497800663, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6i0ab3/risks_of_having_sex/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6i0ab3", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6i0ab3/risks_of_having_sex/", "retrieved_on": 1500154855, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Risks of having sex", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6i0ab3/risks_of_having_sex/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "fertthrowaway", "author_created_utc": 1425919151, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "37, unexplained, 3 IUI (MMC at 12.5 weeks on 1st), IUI #4 now", "author_fullname": "t2_m0e5b", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497802550, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6i0gcd/has_anyone_had_egg_retrieval_with_only_local/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6i0gcd", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 32, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6i0gcd/has_anyone_had_egg_retrieval_with_only_local/", "retrieved_on": 1500154938, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm on my 4th IUI cycle currently but trying to plan ahead since we've decided to move onto IVF next month, due to my age.  I live in a European country that ordinarily subsidizes infertility treatment (my IUIs have been free except for the drugs), but will be paying for IVF privately out-of-pocket because the wait list is nearly a year in the public system. So I do have a little option in where I go for this, although there seem to be wait lists at some of the more popular private clinics as well.\n\nIt seems common in this part of Europe that they only administer local anesthetic for egg retrieval. I asked my current clinic (which would be the simplest place to switch to private treatment since I'm already in with them, plus their price is less than others) if they give sedative and they said they don't. However their brochure says they also give an IV injection of a morphine-like painkiller called Rapifen. I've been pretty frightened about the egg retrieval process for a long time and I can't find any people who have done something similar - I can only find that people recommend the sedation heavily over not being sedated, but presumably without this extra painkiller administered.

I've never posted but I feel somewhat backed into a corner so I thought I'd post my situation to see if anyone had any insight. \n\nI came off birth control (pill) in October 2015 after about 11 years of consistence use. Periods were like clockwork. Came off, no immediate pregnancy as I'd hoped. I've always been a fairly healthy person, no major ailments in my past and a decent diet and exercise regimen (until recently for no real reason). Six months went by and I started to notice a dull pain on my left side. A little over a year later, no relief. \n\nThis past weekend some friends were in town and we did the theme park tour of SoCal (miles and miles of walking, and I am fairly sedentary currently). When we left for the night I started experiencing not just a dull pain, but really strong sharp pain. Occasionally the pain spreads across my whole lower stomach/pelvic area, or where I imagine all the relevant reproductive parts are. It has been about 16 hours of intense pain now. \n\nLast month I saw a doctor who ordered two ultrasounds for me to try to diagnose the lingering pain. They came back normal. Blood work was normal. Now with this pain I feel so effing helpless. I was hoping for an \"easy\" explanation... cyst, PCOS, fibroids, gas (seriously though) so that I had a clear path to take care of it. I plan to reach out to my doctor to ask for more diagnostics.. but I guess what I'm asking is, does this sound familiar to anyone at all??  It hurts to touch the area around it. Just any input would be so appreciated. I am sorry if this isn't the correct avenue to start looking for answers, but I feel awful and stuck. \n\ntl;dr -- severe pelvic pain, no successful diagnostic procedures, no answers, no hope. \u2639\ufe0f", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help with a potentially unique situation", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6i19y8/help_with_a_potentially_unique_situation/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "RockyBalboa84", "author_created_utc": 1490391958, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "DOR,MFI,broke ass broad", "author_fullname": "t2_16gvx8", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497822089, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6i28l2/journal_club_sunday_topic_protocols/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6i28l2", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "", "link_flair_text": "IUI", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6i28l2/journal_club_sunday_topic_protocols/", "retrieved_on": 1500155818, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Success rates vary by ovulation induction protocol and body mass index: toward personalized medicine for intrauterine insemination\n\n\n\nR. Mark Adams, PhD, MA, MSc, BA, Ju Zhang, PhD, Anthony Santistevan, MS, Karen Hunter Cohn, PhD, Keri Kalmbach, PhDThe Polaris Data Networkb, Erin Wolff, MD, Piraye Yurttas Beim, PhD.\n\n\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2017.02.025\nArticle Info click to collapse contents \n\u00a9 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.\n\n\nBackground:\nObesity rates are increasing worldwide. \n\nAlong with others, we have demonstrated that body mass index (BMI) influences fertility treatment success rates in a protocol-dependent fashion. \n\nMuch less is known about intrauterine insemination (IUI) success because of the absence of IUI data in national reporting registries, such as the one maintained by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART).\n\nObjective \n\nTo investigate the effectiveness of ovulation induction with gonadotropins versus ovulation induction with oral agents and gonadotropins (aka \u201cmini-stim\u201d) in relation to BMI in patients undergoing IUI in a large, multi-center, retrospective analysis.\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n\nWe analyzed 67,662 treatment cycles from 33,867 patients undergoing IUI ovulation induction (OI) with gonadotropins alone versus oral agents and gonadotropin from 2009 to 2016. \n\nDiscrete-time proportional-odds models with time-dependent covariates were used to model the odds of achieving ongoing pregnancy during a given cycle. \n\nInteraction terms between BMI and stimulation type were included in the models to test the hypothesis that the effect of BMI was modified by stimulation type. \n\n\nBMI was treated continuously and categorized according to NIH guidelines (&lt;18.5, 18.5\u201325, 25\u201330, 30\u201335, &gt;35). \n\nModels were adjusted for age, antral follicle count, medication type, sperm motility, clinic, diagnoses, and were weighted toward more recent data.\n\nResult(s)\nOverall, OI with only gonadotropin agents had significantly higher odds of achieving ongoing pregnancy compared to OI with oral agents and gonadotropins (OR = 1.16, p &lt; 0.05). \n\n\nHowever, we found that the impact of BMI on success rates also differed significantly with the type of IUI treatment protocol. \n\nThe effect of BMI was nonlinear and peaked in the obesity categories of both protocols (p &lt; 0.05, see Figure 1). \n\nAt lower levels of BMI, there was no significant difference in the odds of having an ongoing pregnancy between stimulation types. \n\nHowever, there was a pronounced divergence in success rate as BMI increased; gonadotropin OI alone performed better than gonadotropin OI with oral agents. \n\nWhen subcategories of BMI were assessed, a statistically significant difference in success was observed in women with a BMI of 25\u201330. \n\nAdditionally, gonadotropin OI alone was associated with higher odds of multiples than gonadotropin with oral agents (OR = 1.53, p &lt; 0.05), independent of patient BMI.\n\nConclusion(s) \n\n\n\nOral OI agents when used in conjunction with gonadotropins appear to be less effective for obese women. \n\nWe previously demonstrated oral agents alone result in lower pregnancy rates with both timed intercourse and IUI in obese women. However, the detrimental effect of increased BMI was not observed with gonadotropin alone. Here, we demonstrate that OI with only gonadotropin agents is associated with higher success rates than OI with oral agents and gonadotropins. This difference is most pronounced in higher BMI patients. Additionally, we demonstrated gonadotropin OI alone is related to a higher probability of multiples than oral and gonadotropin independent of BMI. \n\nThese data suggest that the best IUI protocol for a given patient varies with respect to their BMI.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Sunday Topic: Protocols", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6i28l2/journal_club_sunday_topic_protocols/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "RockyBalboa84", "author_created_utc": 1490391958, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "DOR,MFI,broke ass broad", "author_fullname": "t2_16gvx8", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497822924, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6i2b8b/for_the_noobs_overview_of_if_treatments/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6i2b8b", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6i2b8b/for_the_noobs_overview_of_if_treatments/", "retrieved_on": 1500155855, "score": 38, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[From UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infertility-treatment-with-gonadotropins-beyond-the-basics)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "For the \"noobs\" overview of IF treatments.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6i2b8b/for_the_noobs_overview_of_if_treatments/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "dasnahce", "author_created_utc": 1469839471, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_zxyae", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497830158, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6i2xkm/delayed_period_clomid_sideeffect/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6i2xkm", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6i2xkm/delayed_period_clomid_sideeffect/", "retrieved_on": 1500156162, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I just had my first round of clomid- very low dose, day 5-9.

This update is mainly to thank everyone who took the time to comment on my last post and those who reached out via PMs. I read them all even if in my intense panic/depressive moment I didn't reply to all of them.\n\nAfter the initial shock had subsided I collected myself, and I tried to come up with a plan with what I could do to improve my situation. \n\nI spoke to my GP and following his advice I wrote a letter to the gynaecologist who works at the Fertility Clinic, and I organised to meet with PALS. \n\nThe days after my meeting with PALS I received a phone call from the Clinic Coordinator who wanted to give me the right version of the story. Apparently, the nurses had given me incorrect information as they did not know what was going on (it is always somebody else's fault when things don't go the way they are supposed to, isn't it?).\n\nIn his words, the lab working with the hospital was acquired by a bigger company that introduced major changes in the patient access and the testing procedures that they can guarantee to the hospital. \nFor what it concerns my particular case, my possible 'embryos' will undergo a biopsy and will be frozen until the result of the tests is back (4/5 weeks). Apparently, this new way of testing is more accurate than the previous one, but it changes the protocol I was previously assigned (obviously). \n\nWhen we spoke (about ten days ago), I was reassured that my case was a priority for them (due to my condition that forces me to have PGD) and that my treatment should resume fast. \n\nWell, I waited to write this update because I knew my next period would be arriving soon and I was hoping to have good news to share with you all, as I hoped this time the treatment would happen.\n\nUnfortunately, I received a phone call this Saturday from the same Coordinator asking me if I could provide them with a DNA sample of my mother. This request was an utter surprise as my condition was transmitted to me from my father's side, so my mother was never asked to be included in any testing. \nI told them that this was not possible, as she does not live in the country and she is not in a position where she could easily post by mail (yes, they asked me this too). \nHe answered that it didn't matter, and they would proceed anyway, but this month is still a no go and to try and call next month.\n\nPeople, I am at the end of hope rope. I feel like they are now openly stalling me and I have no other trick I can play to make them work differently. Next month it will be six months since I signed the consent forms since we agreed on my protocol and I still have not received any formal communication from the team informing me on how they intend to proceed.\nI was only asking them to make me start with my stimulation and see how was my response. Because they could be putting me through all this misery only to discover I am not able to produce any egg and that would be the end of my IVF journey (like they were already suspecting at the beginning of the testing). \n\nIn the meanwhile, I saw another gynaecologist from another hospital (an appointment made by a consultant who follows me for my respiratory issues - because he wanted me to get pre-pregnancy counselling) who said he would be happy to refer me to the other clinic in the country (London) if everything else fails. \nI will meet him again at the end of July, so I suppose if the situation has not progressed I will have to try that route. \nI could go to PALS again, but I am so drained and overcome with sadness that I don't think I could put my thoughts into coherent words. \n\nI was hoping to give a better update, but this is it. \nIt's infuriating, frustrating but mostly so sad from my part. Hope is great, but I don't know how many disappointment I can still take after this. I am spiralling down to negativity.

Although I'm a great responder to injectibles (last IVF cycle resulted in 37 eggs and 10 day 5 blasties!), I seem to be unable to carry them past 8 weeks, and the clock is ticking away (Husband is 34, I'm 37 with brittle PCOS). \n\nEven though it was extremely difficult for me to wrap my brain around surrogacy, when we're left with the choice of having no bio kids vs. possibly having them through a surrogate, we are going to go with the latter. We're actually leaving tomorrow night to go to Ukraine, as we'll be using BioTexCom, a clinic that has great reviews online and through phone, as we've both been talking to a few people who just recently welcomed twins due to surrogacy. This would be our dream! It's the first time we feel like we have a guaranteed hope that we can have children at last, because the clinic will continue to try with your frozen embryos (either yours or donor eggs) until they are successful. Seems like most everyone we have talked to were successful on their first try, if not second. \n\nWhen we were looking to connect with parents in the US, it was truly through a network of folks that we got to talk to them to hear about the process, which reassured us that we're not going to be scammed or have trouble bringing our future babies back home. Because of this, just thought I would post here so that you can read about my experience as it happens. I'm super nervous! I will start a blog and try to document everything as much as I can. \n\nAny questions/thoughts/comments welcome!

We were supposed to have  to wait until the clinic opens again after the summer. Anyway, the nurse told me to come on a check up tomorrow and start stims that evening. \n\nYey, I'm super exited to get this show on the road, BUT what if today isn't really CD1? The flow isn't that heavy. I wouldn't really count this as CD1 in normal circumstances. What happens if I start stims too early? It's just that if CD1 isn't today or tomorrow we most likely have  to wait until August to start. Will it ruin everything if I start stims on spotting day 4 instead of the following day, on which the flow might be heavier? How important is this stuff? They monitor the growth of the follicles anyway. If I don't get heavy flow during the night I'm going to of course tell the nurse, but I just wanted to ask if anyone knew anything about this.\n\nDoes any of you have difficulties telling which day is CD1?
