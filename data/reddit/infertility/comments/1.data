We got there and waited for a total of 5 minutes before we were led into a room where I could change into a backless gown, a hair net, and some booties. Husband snapped a couple of pictures of me like this and got a little choked up, seeing that this big thing was really happening. I was too nervous at the moment to get choked up. Then they took him away to contribute to his half.\n\nThe nurses brought me into a little area with a nice recliner and took my vitals and double-checked I had no medicine allergies. I made idle chat with a couple of different ladies (I couldn't tell them apart because each one was dressed in scrubs, hair nets and a mask) and one of them hooked me up to an IV, which was truly the most painful part of this whole thing. My hand...ouch. They pumped some anti-nausea meds through and some form of advil and an antibiotic.\n\nMy doctor came in and quickly summarized what they would be doing (I already knew) and told me she'd call me today (Saturday) to tell me how many eggs fertilized. Then the nurses all escorted me into the rather intimidating operating room and had me lay down on the table.\n\"Okay, we're going to put some anesthesia through now.\" Someone said. The ceiling tiles and florescent lights began to spin. I asked if they were aware that that was happening, and that's the last thing I remember before someone was waking me up. I asked if they started yet and they said they were already done. This made me laugh pretty hysterically (apparently it's normal for women to be laughing or crying when they wake up).\n\nThen someone told me I had 20 eggs retrieved! I sat in the recovery chair and kind of drifted off again before they let me go get dressed. I met up with Bill and a nurse and they gave us some post-op instructions. My teeth wouldn't stop chattering, and they said it was from the anesthesia.\n\n\nI was also in no pain! I'm having a lot of the symptoms I read about....bloating and constipation most notably. I've taken everything under the sun (colace, miralax, like 10 prunes) to help the latter problem but no dice. If it wasn't for that, I'd probably feel more comfortable. I've also gained 2.4 pounds since yesterday at the same time, and I had a ton of gatorade and salty food yesterday so I'm keeping an eye on that.

If you start with medicated cycles then you have IUIs to move to before having to consider IVF.  IUI is the buffer between you and The Big Intervention.  \n\nHere is how I think of it, monitored cycles with meds costs about half as much as IUI.  If money is no object or if insurance is paying for it or if you have national healthcare through your country, add the IUI!  Why not?  It bumps your chances and doesn't increase any risk that I know of.  There isn't a strict limit on how many IUIs a person can do- it's more how many a person is willing to invest in.  \n\nThe other thing is that you can only do so many clomid cycles- I think four.  If clomid is what works for you then pairing it up with the IUI may be what is best.  Of course, there is also femara, which doesn't have the limit.\n\nHowever, if after letting this all digest for a few days, you still want to start with medicated cycles without IUI, ask for it.  We have to be our own advocates in this infertility world.  \n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1421882971, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cnwm0za", "link_id": "t3_2t85cj", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_2t85cj", "reply_delay": 744, "retrieved_on": 1424476678, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "mrstreymcdougal", "author_created_utc": 1387607494, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "40F, 1 m/c, 7 IUI, 4 IVF, DIVF coming in 2015", "author_fullname": "t2_egbus", "body": "Tough call.

I am starting my second round of IVF/PGD this weekend (my husband has a balanced translocation that has resulted in multiple miscarriages for us.)

They said the condition of my uterus was \"perfect.\" Unfortunately the embryo implanted but then didn't continue to develop for some unknown reason resulting in our most recent miscarriage.  The doctor said that it could have just been the small margin of error that science can't totally understand.  It was really sad and hard and frustrating and I'm feeling so scared to start this process all over again but I just keep remembering that old saying, \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\"  My husband isn't open to the idea of adoption and at this point I don't know if I can handle the emotional stress of trying naturally again; so I'm just going to try to keep my blinders on and keep moving forward, knowing that it might not work but this is the only shot we have.  I know EXACTLY how you are feeling.  I know that you want someone to say, \"Yes 100% this is going to work and be perfect.\" I want that so badly myself.  All I can say is hang in there and try to do things to distract and relax yourself and to pass the time.  Thinking about it will just drive you crazy.
