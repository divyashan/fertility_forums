I've been on a waiting list for public treatment (you get 3 IVF cycles for free up to age 40 here - well would be nice to get *something* out of the ridiculous tax I pay, but I wasn't willing to wait around for it at my age) and have my initial consultation for that in mid-January, so there's the question of how many cycles I could even get in before I could start a free cycle.  The cost of a 3 cycle pack (3x IVF plus extra 2x FET), which has to be used up within 2 years (and of course if you get a baby is considered used up), is double the cost of a single cycle, but is still overall reasonable at about $7300.  If you get no embryos to transfer however and paid for a single cycle, then you get 50% off the next single IVF cycle. And extra FET if there are frozen embryos and the first transfer fails, if you don't have a package, cost about $800. AHHHH how to decide?!!

Husband was not impressed about being woken up by that many messages. Obviously I responded with 8 messages at 4am her time. \n\nAnnoyance aside, my sister is recently engaged and tried to contact my 93 year old grandmother, who lives with my mother's younger sister, to tell her the news. Aunt was super rude and accused my sister of harassing her because she tried to call 3 times over the last 2 days and got no reply so texted my aunt. Sister responded with a well thought out logical response and pointed out some troubling behaviour on my aunts part, which includes isolating my grandmother from family, giving away/selling my grandmother's possessions, trying to keep my grandmother from revealing they were moving, refusing to give new address, to name a few. Aunt rang and yelled at my sister and told her to never contact her again. Now she's worried my aunt is going to ramp up her effort keep anyone from talking to or seeing my grandmother. \n\nAll of my family is pretty worried, as we're sure something is going on. When I went to visit before leaving the country my grandmother acted like she was afraid my aunt would find out we knew the house was being sold (we found the listing online so I don't know how she thought that would stay a secret). We all suspect my aunt is trying to get all of my grandmother's money, and is telling her that's all everyone else wants and that my aunt is protecting her. None of us care how my grandmother spends her money or who she leaves it to, we just want to be able to have contact with her and to know that she is happy in her living arrangement. \n\nWith all of that going on it makes me wish I was able to visit more before moving. My grandmother, however, lived 2 hours from me and treatment was not kind enough to me to allow that trip often. I'm hoping my mother will be able to get in touch with my grandmother and will hopefully be able to sort some stuff out.
