I think the argument of \"ifyou can't afford the extra $$, how can you afford a child?\" is such BS! And I hate it when someone brings up an argument like that! We're stuck with IVF&lt; and I can assure you, the $10K we're going to have to spend could have been much better used on the baby needs.... \n\nThe money side is very hard. I don't know much about your finances and I can't fully weigh in, but I can't help but feel that if its something you really want, you need to try and push through! (If you decide you don't want it, of course, totally respect that, its a valid choice).\n\nMy husband and I started with a really strict budget -- we did the normal things: Cut cable, negotiated cell bills down, started cooking as much at home as possible, packing lunches, cutting out eating out, carpooled where we could, caught up on filing old taxes (oops) etc. etc. Every extra penny went into the savings account. We then started to see if there were any side jobs we could do -- my husband started to pick up the odd Saturday shift helping a friend with theatre installations. I've done so many odd jobs (from power washing the neighbors deck, to getting a cleaning job in an apartment building for 2 hours a week).\n\nNot going to lie, pinching pennies and taking on extra work isn't fun, and has meant we've had to also keep tabs on our relationship to make sure we're checking in with each other as much as possible. But, we've managed to save up almost $7K towards our IVF. Because I'm 35, we've decided to not wait until we hit the magic $10K number but we're pushing through. I don't have the heart to think of the \"next round\". One thing at a time.\n\nI don't know enough about you to know how frugal you currently are, or if you already have taken measures to save money. But, I can sympathize with how difficult the money side of things make it all!\n\nRegarding the costs, I don't know about donor sperm costs because we've not had to go that route. But, I did find our one IUI was relatively inexpensive (comparatively) as I was put on femera. Fertility is an off label use, so it cost me $5 for the cycle's meds!  There is a much lower likely hood of multiples, so I didn't need any additional monitoring, so it was just the cost of the procedure. (In fact, I have some of the femera left over....).\n\nI am also fortunate in that there are multiple clinics around -- so when it came to IVF, its actually cheaper for us to take hte ferry to Victoria than to stick around Vancouver!\n\nI feel like I'm throwing a lot of information at you!

However.... even though (as far as I know) LGBT couples can get their sperm and procedure paid for through health insurance, there is also a website that is totally aimed at matching willing donors with 'wensouders' ('wish parents'). The donors range from men who're just happy to help out to gay couples looking for some form of co-parenthood with a lesbian couple.\n\nIs something like that an option for you? Maybe you can find a male gay couple to co-parent with somehow or find a willing donor who doesn't want to be involved in the parenting part and is just happy to spread his genes? That could in theory be completely costless and if you use the 'turkey batter' method you don't actually have to have sex with said donor. \n\nObviously this is all provided neither of you (or the one of you who'll carry the child) has actual fertility problems. Also, you might want to really get down with you cycles and time the hell out of it so things don't go to waste.

Where was your endo exactly, what kind(s) and what stage? Were they able to remove it all? Are you still trying naturally or already doing IUI? Were there any other indications that sometimes might be wrong (hormones off, male factor)?\n\nIf you endometriosis caused the infertility and it got removed now, in theory you should be back to 'normal' chances which means that it can easily still take up to a year to get pregnant. Since this is just your third cycle after the lap, I wouldn't immediately assume the worst. However, menstruation (aka failed cycles) aren't good for endo so in that sense it's obviously best if you are either on birth control or totally going for it every cycle (either IUI or at the very least timing the hell out of things and using ovulation-pee-sticks). \n\nI've been recently diagnosed with stage 4 endo, I had all five kinds. The bits around my colon couldn't be removed, but the bits that stuck my ovaries to my uterus could so in theory I have a better chance now. They don't want me to try naturally anymore though because it's bad for the endo, so I'm doing IUI now (two more times, then IVF). They give me about a 10% chance per cycle (=perfectly timed, because IUI). That all depends on the what/where/why/how... AND it can still mean that the endo was just a coincidence and there is something else at play that causes the fertility problems (maybe something genetic, you won't figure that out until you do IVF and they notice weird things).\n\nSo yeah... you will simply not know how easy you will get pregnant now.
