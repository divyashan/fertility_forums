My husbands SA was completely normal. \n\nMy first RE said Donor Eggs were our only option... I am not saying this to scare you but I was totally unprepared to hear it and in shock that day. Maybe by hearing it as a possibility you can be prepared with questions. The second RE said well, the chance isn't ZERO but wouldn't say it was any kind of chance... and said if we tried IVF with my eggs it would probably be months and thousands of dollars in meds before they might get anything to work with... and they highly recommended donor egg. We are currently working toward a shared risk donor egg cycle at Shady Grove in Maryland. \n\n\nEdited to say you are completely right, this shit is not fair, it sucks.

I would just say that your platelets are in the low 400s, and leave it at that. \n\nYou could be iron deficient, this could be a side effect of meds, you could have inflammation somewhere (arthritis, infection, a rheumatologic problem, a cold, almost anything), or you could have a problem with your bone marrow that makes you produce too many platelets. Of these bone marrow issues, most of them just require observation, not treatment. Alternatively, some peoples' platelet just run a little bit outside of the normal range. Normal ranges are based on the 95% confidence interval of a healthy population, so by definition 5% of healthy people will fall outside of the range, and that's fine. \n\nIt is reasonable to see a hematologist who should take a good history from you, check a blood smear and run a couple other blood tests. However, I wouldn't freak out about it. In our population (i.e. women of child-bearing age) the most common reasons for high platelets are iron deficiency anemia and drug side effects.
