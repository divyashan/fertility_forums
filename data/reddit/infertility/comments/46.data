I have told two people at work, first my immediate boss (when I started missing work for last minute appointments) and our HR manager (when we planned our trip to Mexico for IVF). I work at a university so everyone is very respectful of my rights to privacy about medical stuff and I've had no problems. I'm just telling anyone else who asks that we are going on vacation to Mexico. Depending on how many times we have to go, that excuse might get tricky, but it's what I'm going with for now. \n\nMy partner, on the other hand, works at a small business and even though he just told his immediate bosses, basically everyone knows now. I was there the other day for an event, and this guy I barely know says \"I hope Mexico is good,\" and I'm like, okay dude, thanks, me too, and he's like \"it WILL BE,\" all knowing like. And I'm just like, I know you know my fucking business more than you should, but at least have the decency to realize you don't actually know me and it's not something I want to interact with you about. But at least it was subtle enough that I could just ignore it, basically. And he meant well I'm sure, blah blah blah.  \n\nSo anyway, my partner was recently at a meeting that included some people who don't know (who are kind of peripherally involved with just one project) and it came up that he wouldn't be at the next project meeting. Someone asked why, and he said he'd be in Mexico. They asked why again, and he hesitated, trying to figure out what he wanted to say / how much he wanted to reveal, and this girl he works with - WHO HE HAS NEVER SPOKEN TO ABOUT IT AND REALLY DISLIKES - blurted out \"they're going to try to get pregnant.\" \n\nI am so mad for him, y'all. So inappropriate on so many levels. It was not in any fucking way hers to disclose to anybody. She wouldn't even know in the first place if there were any kind of decent professional boundaries at his job. And his bosses have been awesome about it in every other way - really kind and understanding, and THEY haven't said a word to me about it - but somehow it got out in the office so now this girl knows and even though he kinda blew it off I know he was upset about it. And me, well, if she tries to talk to me about it (she's totally the type that would) I am going to lose it. I just know she is bursting to the brim with bingos. Hopefully I can mostly avoid her, but FUCK. I have told like 3 of my closest friends and now this annoying busybody at his work is telling random people. \n\nPISSED. \n\nThat's all.
