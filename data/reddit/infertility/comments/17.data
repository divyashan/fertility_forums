It was so nice to speak with someone in person about this - I don't know anyone in the non-virtual world going through this. \n\nYesterday I did normal things: brunch with family, nice long stroll in the city, taking the pup to the dog park, and baking cookies with my mom. Even though I had to bring my needles a long, it felt like a good night.

I'm in a similar boat this holiday season. Miscarried last week with a PGS embryo at 6w. We haven't had our in-depth follow-up consult with our RE yet (scheduled Jan 5th) so I was really interested in what your RE had to say. Sounds like not a whole lot, though \"10% of PGS embryo,\" comment was *sort of* comforting? I know comforting isn't the right word at all when you've just been one of the unlucky \"10%,\" but I'm hoping that means the odds of the same thing happening to you or I again is slim.\n\nChristmas will be really hard, I know. Boy do I know. But for whatever it's worth, know that you're not alone. \n\nAs for my mom (and mother-in-law), I asked them months ago to please stop asking about \"project baby.\" I told them politely that I'm tired of talking about it, and that there's more to us (my husband and I) than being a baby-making machines. Ask about the other things in our lives because that's what we'd like to focus on right now. They still can't help asking sometimes, but I now have a scripted response to them when they do ask, \"We're taking a break and just enjoying life. We deserve that.\" While \"taking a break\" isn't entirely true, it seems to keep them at bay, and reinforces that we're trying to focus on what we have to be thankful for, and not what we're missing.\n\nI go back and forth on how much info to give our parents. Our mothers are both very caring and emotionally intuitive, which we're thankful for. On the other hand, they're both soooo saaaddd whenever something doesn't go as planned, and I've found it's hard to process my own emotions when I also feel responsible for helping them process theirs. It's a little too much to take. So for now, we've kept this round to ourselves.\n\nSorry I didn't intend to write so much, and I didn't mean to hi-jack your post. Thanks so much for sharing and again, know that I'm thinking of you. It fucking hurts, but we can get through this, one day at a time, one step at a time. &lt;3", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1450711166, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cy6mm8f", "link_id": "t3_3xmejn", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_3xmejn", "reply_delay": 64165, "retrieved_on": 1451774589, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "grakkaw", "author_created_utc": 1443107217, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_qpi7s", "body": "It'd be awesome if it worked that way! \n\nI'm right there with you - CD37 and counting...", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1450711183, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cy6mmkz", "link_id": "t3_3xoqu5", "nest_level": 2, "parent_id": "t1_cy6lad1", "reply_delay": 2646, "retrieved_on": 1451774593, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "CatStaringAtMe", "author_created_utc": 1440799600, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "39F, unexplained,\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "author_fullname": "t2_pxo67", "body": "Kids shouldn't be allowed at RE clinics!!! &gt;:(", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1450711212, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cy6mn55", "link_id": "t3_3xoqu5", "nest_level": 2, "parent_id": "t1_cy6ivbl", "reply_delay": 8951, "retrieved_on": 1451774601, "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej"}, {"author": "secondtimeisacharm", "author_created_utc": 1421097637, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "32yo, ttc #1, 2 mc, unexplained, IUI#2 failed & onto injectables", "author_fullname": "t2_koawk", "body": "I'm sorry :( I'm not into it at all this year, either.
