That was after I had a good few years of underemployment to beef up those frugal skills, and underscore the importance of having savings. \n\nSo we structured our lives and finances after marriage to minimize expenses while still living in an expensive area. One cheap car between the two of us, a smaller house and smaller mortgage. A townhome with low mantainance costs. We cook at home a lot, have cheap hobbies (hiking, board games) and fill up two Roth IRAs and an HSA each year. Even though we're now mid career, our expenses are pretty similar to what they were in grad school/underemployment times. \n\nWhen we first started TTC, we added a pretend \"daycare\" expense to our budget, figuring it would give us a feel for how much we could spend and become a nice maternity/paternity leave and nursery stocking fund. \n\nSo that cash, and our HSA is going to make up a majority of our out of pocket expenses. \n\nWe also happened to pick living in a state with IF coverage mandate (whoop whoop!) so our diagnosis costs so far have been minimal and our first IUI is going to be about $800. I'm lucky enough to just be on clomid + hcg trigger + provera, which is basically the cheapest drug combo you can ask for as its all generic. \n\nOur clinic does a shared risk program that would be pretty attractive if we had no IF coverage, or (god forbid) we bust our insurance lifetime limit. The program is $20k for 6 IVF cycles and unlimited FET cycles until you take home a live baby or you get $20k back (to start adoption work). \n\nSo, I know a lot of this post is just saying \"duh, have money already\", but there are a lot of ways to cut monthly expenses and make it a habit. We're not lawyers or doctors, but we are DINKS professionals and we've been making the best of it for the last few years.
