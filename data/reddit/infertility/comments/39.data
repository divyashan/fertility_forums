Literally. We just finished up the very last cycle of TI that we'll ever do, and as anxious as I am about taking a treatment hiatus, I will never miss obligatory sex. It can kiss my ass, not that it'll find my ass, or anything else, sexy. It is the vanilla yogurt of sex. If infertility sex were music, it would be 16 minutes straight of Smash Mouth. As ventriloquists are to entertainment, so is timed intercourse to sex. \n\nThis is one of my buttons, as you can see from my post history. I have very little advice for you, because we've never been able to crack the code. Sometimes a little bit of alcohol helps, but you have to be careful with that, because too much hinders. It can also be good to change things up, even if they're little changes. If you usually have sex at night, do it in the morning on the first day (if that doesn't screw up your timing). Mostly, just reassure each other that you love each other and you find each other attractive. If you have failures, do your best to laugh at them and let them roll off your backs. You may not be able to overcome the awkwardness of TI, but you can regroup afterward and get back on course with your regular sex life.\n\nKnow that you're not alone, and plenty of other people in other bedrooms around the world are all, \"Just finish already!\" You can do this (and then you can pretend you never had to).
