The mom and pop or the CVSs and Walgreens, are (as a general rule) usually priced higher than other places who don't rely on their pharmaceutical sales, largely due to contract agreements with the distribution/insurance compaines. I can only speak for CVS and will tell you they pass the \"miscellaneous\" fees to the patients. So a cheap medication at one pill will cost the same as five or ten. It's a minimum set price that corporate set. Last I checked, I believe it was 10.99.\n\nWalmart, CostCo, Sam's Club are going to be your best bet.
