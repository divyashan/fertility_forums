So I embraced my hormones and wrote this:\n\nSome days I'm at peace with myself and I'm happy for you. Other days I'm bitter and jealous, or angry and sad, and I hate you all. Sometimes I'm still happy for you but I am also sad for me, and because of that, the sight of you makes me sick, even though I am happy for you. Some days I'm just really busy, busy and having fun even, and I forget for a little while. Sometimes I remember that in other ways, I\u2019ve been really lucky. But perspective rarely lasts. Before long I'm bitter again. When I look at you, it reminds me to drink the bitterness antidote, and I drink it every single day to keep it from poisoning me and my relationships. Even though it tastes like rubbing alcohol and some days I'd rather just let the poison work, I take the antidote daily; I take it for you.\n\nI don\u2019t know who it\u2019s written to, I guess just to my Facebook feed but ya know. It\u2019s therapeutic to write it out sometimes.
