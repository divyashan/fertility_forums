Educate husband, communicate with him about where you are, what your needs are, hear where he is and what his needs are.  Let him know that IVF prices vary dramatically between clinics and the odds of it working are pretty good for you guys.  Frankly, IVF costs about what a new inexpensive car costs and I'd rather spend my money on a chance of having a kid than a new car.  Yes, it is huge money to spend on what most people get for free, but into each life a little rain must fall and this is my rain (and it fucking better stop raining soon.).

Take time to just be sad right now.  That's OK.  Infertility brings on real grief and real loss, even if it's of something you don't actually have yet.  It's a pain not many people understand, but that everyone in this sub will get.  \n\nIf people ask questions and you don't want to answer...you're allowed to say, \"I'm sorry.  We're still figuring things out, and it's kind of personal.  If it's OK, I'd rather not talk about it.\"  For me, learning to be really open with people about all I've gone through and am still going through actually helps, though.  There's a little bit of wading through bullshit platitudes, but people are mostly supportive and want to help if any way they can.  \n\nNothing takes away the jealousy, the anger, the fear, and the pity, unfortunately.  Nothing.  Some days are good, and other days are bad.  You learn to live with those feelings and find a new normal in terms of how to deal with them.  Letting people know what you need is a huge help.  Counseling is even bigger.  (This would be a great thing to ask your RE about on Monday.  Your husband may not be excited about it, but seriously.  Counseling is a huge help.)  \n\nAs far as some of the medical stuff you're going through, I actually came through with a very similar diagnosis, also on Wednesday.  After a pregnancy from femara/IUI ended in a loss at 22 weeks near the end of 2014, I started having unexplained ectopic pregnancies.  The third and final one I had at the end of this year seems to have ruined my tubes, even though all my ectopics were caught early and treated successfully with methotrexate.  I can tell you for sure that second, third, and fourth opinions will all tell you that IVF is the only safe and effective means for you to become pregnant; your risk of ectopics with a damaged tube is high, although it's more likely that a pregnancy is just impossible.  Even IVF that leaves damaged tubes in place usually doesn't work and.dor results in miscarriage, as fluid trapped in a hydrosalpinx is toxic to a developing embryo. A laparoscopic surgery to remove your tubes will probably be recommended before you proceed with any treatment.  Trust me - I know firsthand how awful that is to hear.  I've been agonizing over the same news all week, even as I prepare to begin IVF.  (We've decided to go forward with an egg retrieval this month, freeze any embryos we get, then have my salpingectomy and go for a FET after I recover.)  It's rough.  It may take time for you to accept.  You will have days where you accept it and think you're fine, and then the next day someone you know posts a baby bump photo on Facebook and you want to break everything you own.  The good news is that if you ovulate fine and your husband's sperm look good...you have a very, very high chance of success with IVF.  We've been told that assuming everything goes smoothly and we get some good embryos, each cycle has up to, if not upwards, of a 60% chance of success for us.  So as you take time to process this loss, perhaps you can find comfort in knowing that while it will be a long, painful, unexpected process, you can still be parents.  You absolutely can.  \n\nSending some hugs your way.  Feel free to ramble anytime.

Maybe she needs help grieving and doesn't want to talk about it. Getting the information that a procedure with low statistical results, high cost and high invasiveness is probably your only option for children is obviously a huge, life altering moment. Making the choice to pursue or not pursue options is a huge deal. People on this board will tell you that infertility can rip relationships apart. That the reason we visit boards like this one is the profound sense of loneliness in dealing with it. You and your wife need each other to tackle this. At a minimum, you need to get on the same page about what the future holds for you so that it doesn't sneak up and destroy you later. And given your wife's age and the fact that most options will be entirely gone in a sooner rather than later scenario, you need to do it in the nearer future. \n\nThese conversations are hard. My clinic employs a social worker just to help couples find the resources to deal with this things. Maybe your's does too? You are both hurting and going inward, and I get that.
