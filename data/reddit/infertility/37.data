Things seemed to settle down and then... life decided it was time to pile more stress on my plate. In the past 2 weeks:\n\n1) my dad broke his FEMUR when he fell off a little step ladder helping us with our home renovations - not only do I feel terrible about that but now we are waiting on an electrician to finish what my dad can no longer help with... \n\n2) my great-grandma died. It wasn't unexpected, she was 96, but it still hurts. I am going to miss her so much. \n\n3) my elderly dog started having incontinence issues again, which makes me sad. And it also exhausts me bc it increases our laundry about 5 times the normal amount. We got a new medication from the vet, after she had a reaction to the first, so hoping it helps but we won't know for awhile. \n\n4) renovations are moving forward but not as fast as we expected- esp. since the issue in #1 above. We can't start treatment until these are done.  \n\n5) I can't even read the news right now. I am not trying to be political here but this has become such a source of stress for me I have to actively try to disassociate from the current events in this country to cope. But it's proving impossible bc I am a person that always likes to be informed and people know this about me so they always are trying to talk to me about it and it is suspicious/ weird if I am like yeah please don't speak to me about that right now, I am avoiding all news from my hermit hole. Then once I hear something I have to look it up to confirm if it is real. Yep- total dumpster fire, still burning strong. \n\nI just want to \"check out\" for a solid week, but I can't do this bc I have to save my vacation time and money for treatment. Normal adult responsibilities never stop and my husband is so used to my current level of stress being at critical levels that it is a new normal around here rather than a cause for concern so his support has dropped off. \n\nI also forgot to mention I have been having trouble sleeping - as I post this at 1 am - and as a result have been struggling getting to work on time which makes me feel like a total basket case who has not one iota of shit together. Not even a little bit together. I am gaining weight, I have not worn make-up in a good 2 months at least, just turning into a sad frump. \n\nI know this is super whiny and long but it has been too much to post on the daily and I needed to get it out. \n\nTL;DR Fuck you, life.

Quick back story: Went straight to IVF timed with TESE so I've never messed with IUIs (TESE failed so it ended up being donor sperm for the IVF). Got 3 embryos from our IVF cycle resulting in 2 miscarriages and 1 failed transfer. But learned I have an autoimmune issue so (in theory) addressing that should lower the miscarriage risk. So now we're back at square one of how should I go about trying to get pregnant. \n\nWe are using donor sperm so because of that we could do donor IUIs or do another round of donor IVF. Part of me says \"IUI duh!\" because it's cheaper per round and way less medically invasive. But the success rates per cycle are lower and at $2000+ a pop that adds up fast if we have a few failed IUIs (I'm guessing based on what I've seen other ladies post plus the cost of donor sperm). But IVF is a bitch and costs around $17000 with meds but has a higher success rate per try (plus $3500 for any FETs). Money isn't too much of an issue since I still have a last bit of an inheritance from my dad's passing. \n\nSo really the decision is medical and statistical.

I thought I'd seen it all, knew it all, and was prepared for all. But, I've been thrown a curve-ball, and I want your opinions or experience with this. Searching left me with no answers. \n\nI went in for my baseline Wednesday to get the IVF 3 party started, but I had 2 cysts, one on each ovary. They were about 12-16 in size. I was sent home and told to wait for blood work results and instructions. If they are producing estrogen, we'll have to sit this cycle out and maybe to estrace priming in the luteal phase of this cycle to prevent this from recurring. If they are not, we might proceed. Sounds right, okay. I'm not new to cysts, I make them like no one else. \n\nMy estradiol came back at 72, which isn't high. But my nurse called me and then emailed me with the summary, below:\n\n&gt;So the reason we're not starting is because the ultrasound showed 2 larger follicles on your ultrasound. Normally, this means that your body has already selected two follicles for this particular month to grow. This normally doesn't happen until later in the menstrual cycle, but in your case it happened very early on. \n\n&gt;The problem with starting injections is that if we started, its very likely that only these two follicles would hog all the drug and grow. \n\n&gt;We checked an estradiol level and normally this level would be elevated (meaning the follicles are already producing hormone). In your case, the estradiol was still low, so unclear if these are just left overs from a previous cycle or just a bit too early in their growing stage. \n\n&gt;Dr. recommends still proceeding with the same type of protocol (day 2 start, Gonal F, Menopur, antagonist and Growth hormone), but first we need to assure that 1) these follicles are gone and 2) we prevent the same thing from happening next month. \n\n&gt;We do this by doing something called \"estrace priming\" where we basically give you oral Estrace in the luteal phase (the second half, after ovulation) of your cycle. When you take the Estrace, it tricks your brain into not pumping out FSH so early on in your cycle, and therefore should prevent these early follicles. \n\n&gt;But in order to guarantee that you ovulate and the timing of starting the Estrace is correct, we want to trigger ovulation. That is why we want you to come back in a week. If the follicles have grown and your estradiol has risen, we can trigger ovulation and plan to start the estace a week later. Otherwise, if not growing/making hormone, we may have to just follow the cycle and see what happens to these follicles. \n\n\nSo, you can see, they think these cysts are early follicles and not cysts at all? But the low level of estradiol would seem to indicate they are cysts, right? In the years I've been doing infertility treatment, I've been benched A LOT because of cysts. Like, at least 8 times in 2 years. Could I really just been pre-maturely creating follicles that my previous clinic thought were cysts (previous clinic never tested estradiol)? I do have short cycles at 24-26 days, and I've read DOR women can sometimes have early recruitment. \n\nI understand why I cannot proceed with the IVF this cycle. If they are cysts, there's a chance they could rupture or damage the ovarian environment. If they are follicles, they'll suck up all the meds. I get all that. What's really throwing me for a loop is the plan for me go back in a week and trigger theses follicles and start estrace priming. Has anyone here ever done anything like that? Not the estrace priming, but the triggering to get rid of them? BCPs are the standard treatment and what my previous clinic always did. I do NOT want BCPs. I was on them for my first IVF, and I was way over suppressed, so I'm glad we're not going that way, this is just a situation I've never dealt with before. What do you guys think?\n\nOne last thing, about DHEA. I was on DHEA for all of 2015-16. I had cyst after cyst. After our first IVF failed, I stopped taking it because I didn't think it made a difference and I hate myself and most things while on it. Well, lo and behold, when I went in for my baseline for IVF 2, having not taken DHEA, there were no cysts! My Dr told me to go back on the DHEA for IVF 3, so I did, and now I have theses cysts.

Reverse culture shock for me (been living abroad for the past 7 years), new culture shock/language barrier for him, and a bunch of logistical stuff to work out with documentation, insurance, long-overdue dental care, etc. But finally we got ourselves to an RE for more extensive testing.\n\n**The present:** According to the doctor, we're \"medically boring.\" All blood/hormone numbers normal. No apparent problems with uterus/tubes/ovaries. Sperm count good. No overlapping genetic conditions. Just straight up unexplained.\n\nLast month we did our first IUI - failed. Trying again this month. 12 inches of snow fell yesterday, and boy do I miss those endless 80-degree days in Brazil  :-(\n\n**The future:** This is our plan - if the 3 IUIs don't work, we'll take a few months' break, maybe do some traveling while we think about next steps. I'm undecided if I want to do IVF.\n\nI've found myself somewhat detached and clinical about this whole thing. I really want to have kids, but it's almost like I've distanced my emotions from it - if we're successful, awesome; if not, I know I can still have a happy life. I want it to happen, but I won't be devastated if it doesn't. \n\nHonestly the most painful part would be fielding the questions from friends/family, especially in Brazil where it's a little less taboo to ask about or comment on a couple's reproductive plans.

The previous two times Mrs.bc was put under anesthestic, so I just waited outside.  I had my eyes glued to the ultrasound monitor the whole time.  It was quite surreal.  Also, in a weird coincidence, the doctor asked me about the shirt I was wearing, which is from my old high school.  He recognized the name from the street.

I promise I read the rules and FAQs) and this is my first post about infertility on the internets (intimidating!). After 7 years on the pill, I stopped Fall of 2014. We started TTC Feb 2015. My cycles were crazy and up to 55 days long and we weren't having any luck.  I tried a few rounds of clomid with my OB but didn't have a \"robust\" response.  I felt super defeated seeing some tech at the OB's office monthly. I didn't understand why my cycles were still so long and I didn't feel like I was being educated. A midwife friend told me about the Creighton Model System so I started seeing a consultant to learn more about tracking my signs of fertility (I started tracking cervical mucus (CM)).  I also read Taking Charge of Your Fertility and Zita West's Eat Yourself Pregnant to learn more about how conception works. I started seeing a Creighton/NaPro doctor Fall 2015 and was diagnosed with PCOS. Dr said labs weren't slam-dunk PCOS, but long cycles and classic string of pearl ovaries were. Using Femara we got my cycles shorter, started taking supplements for CM including mucinex, started day 7 progesterone bloods, follicle scans etc. Nothing. Finally, May 2016 I did HSG to check tubes (believe me I am still kicking myself for putting off this test for fear of pain) and discover I have a septate uterus (wall of tissue divided my uterus at the top). We stopped TTC for fear of loss and I had lap surgery July 2016 to remove uterine septum and check for suspected endometriosis. NaPro Dr's claim to train in advanced surgical techniques to minimize scaring, so I felt like I was in great hands. During lap, advanced endo (Dr said 3 on scale from 1-4) was found, and I had full blown (5 small incisions) abdominal, robotic surgery.  With clean tubes (tubes were clear at HSG), endo and uterine septum removed (blood-filled cyst on left ovary was also removed) we were ready to TTC again. Sorry for the additional detail, but I had an extremely traumatic psychological allergic reaction to the narcotics from the surgery - Ultram (Tramadol). Intense anxiety, agitation and suicidal thoughts.  The absolute most hellish 24 hours of my life. My Dr. actually released me from the hospital in this state, thinking I was fatigued from lack of sleep during hospital stay.  When I was still hyperventilating at the drop of a hat at home, hubby and I knew something was wrong and Dr. changed meds. This traumatic experience caused me to loose faith in the Dr. She had also suggested an ovarian wedge resection during the surgery and this recommendation also unsettled me. So Fall 2016 we started seeing RE (RE said previous Dr. \"toasted\" my ovary which freaked me out and new RE kind of laughed at all my CM charting). I'm on a higher dose of Femara and using Ovidrel shot around CD 14, instead of waiting until CD 18 or so when my OPK kits would normally turn + on my own.  RE also did a follow up hysteroscopy Oct 2016 to remove \"widow's peak\" left over from earlier septum resection. I've done the Femara + Ovidrel protocol 3 times since and still nothing.  This RE has shut down my concerns about low progesterone (he says with mature follicle on scan and ovidrel shot, we know I ovulated and that means my progesterone is fine) and poor quality CM (i.e. none, I'm dry as a freaking creek bed). My insurance covers IUI at 90% after I meet my deductible, so we plan to try that 2-16-2017. RE said after IUI my only options would be IVF (insurance does not cover) or another lap to see if the first surgery missed something.\n\nI have found all the forums with the confusing acronyms intimidating. After growing up in an unhappy home and clinging to the belief that I would create my own happy family for as long as I can remember, the emotional pain of infertility is almost too much. That is why I am asking for a fertility Sherpa.  What am I missing?  What tests should I ask for (my insurance covers up to IUI at 90%)?  What hope do I have? I'm here for hope. Educate me please.\n\nSummary: 32 with PCOS, uterine septum and endo removed. Current RE protocol Femara (CD 3-7) + Ovidrel CD 14 with IUI planned. Also, I have the damn basal body temperature thermometer next to my bed, but have yet to start. \n\nAlso, I mentioned I have little EWCM around ovulation.  However, every freaking month about 4 days before my period I get thick, gummy CM like clock work.  This is how I know every time I'm not pregnant.  I get the cloudy, gummy stuff, then one day of amber-colored CM then period spotting starts.  Last concern I have is brown spotting.  I usually have some amber/brown spotting day before period bleeding starts. Then after period I have 3-4 days of brown spotting.  Past acupuncturist (didn't stick with it) made me feel like the brown spotting days were bad.

Was supposed to start Femara tonight for second (and probably last) IUI. However, it's looking like I'm probably benched. Baseline showed the following:\n- \"cyst\" on left ovary\n- thick lining, its at 8mm on CD4. Wtf? I don't normally have super thick lining. I was thrilled that it got to 10mm by my iui last cycle. I only bled for 2 days. I only ever bleed for 2 or 3 days. Now I'm worried that my body is never completely \"clearing things out.\"\n- Progesterone is less than 1, Estrogen is at 100 pg/mL (she said while this is high, it wouldn't be enough to cancel if not for the thick lining) \n\nThey told me to come in tomorrow to see if the lining has gone down and if it has I can still do this cycle. I've stopped bleeding completely, so I can't imagine it will go down. However, I agreed to go in because I feel like maybe more data will be useful to figure out my future treatment. Idfk.\n\nI have a theory that when I do progesterone suppositories (I did them last cycle) that blood progesterone is down enough by 14 dpo that it doesn't suppress FSH and a new cycle starts, but the suppositories keep me from bleeding until about 18 dpo. I suspect that around 18dpo I have a withdrawal bleed that lasts a couple days and is then stopped by rising estrogen. I think the \"cyst\" is probably a new follicle growing. I don't know if this is even possible, it's just a guess based on (1) my cycles are always about 4-6 days shorter after a progesterone cycle and (2) this is the second time there has been a cyst and high estrogen at a baseline after a progesterone cycle (the only times I've done a baseline after progesterone). Has anyone ever heard of progesterone suppositories doing this? \n\nThe other possibility is that my hormones are just forever out of sync and things aren't lining up (didn't intend a pun, but now that it's there HA). Which might explain why I *always* have irregular bleeding during unmedicated cycles and why I can't get pregnant.   \n\nThis morning they told me my lining looked out of sync with everything else and if it is out of sync, there's no way I could get pregnant this month so might as well sit it out. This afternoon on the phone she said that they won't do femara if it's still thick tomorrow but that if I get an lh surge at some point they can do an ultrasound and possibly still do a natural iui. Maybe they think my body might correct itself. Frankly I don't know that I'm going to want to spend money on a natural iui, but I might do the ultrasound anyway because I like information. \n\nThis was going to be our last IUI before moving to ivf, mostly for scheduling reasons. I'm finding myself a little unhappy about the thought of not getting to do one more medicated IUI even though I never had high hopes for it to work. But the scheduling issues haven't changed. *And* if it turns out I have chronically \"out of sync\" hormones maybe it makes more sense to IVF where there is more control of that anyway?

Controlled it with birth control for 10+ years. When I went off hormonal birth control I had horrible daily pain, bloating, etc etc and excruciating periods (back to throwing up and blacking out). I've had two excision surgeries, and am doing much much better since then, with no daily pain and somewhat painful periods which I can control with pain meds.

I've finally reached a point where I need to vent to the only ladies who I know will understand my feelings in this situation. \n\nLast year I made a new friend (Jessie), who has quickly become very dear to me. She introduced me to another friend of hers (Taylor), and though I never met this person, we talked over chat frequently. Taylor knew about my infertility and IVF, one day she approached me about her own struggles trying to get pregnant. She had been trying for more than a year and had a history that indicated she may have had uterine or fallopian tube scarring. I listened and encouraged her to see a doctor. This conversation was lengthy and really touched me on a personal level. Some time went on and we didn't talk as much in chat but would email from time to time. \n\nAnyway, a few weeks ago Jessie told me that Taylor is pregnant. No medical intervention, just took a bit longer than normal I suppose. I was devastated and immediately began crying. All I could think was \"why not me?\" Lord knows I have put in enough work between 8 IUIs, one major surgery, and 3 IVF cycles, it's not fair! And I know how childish this is, but damn. \n\nSince finding out she is pregnant, Taylor has not talked to me even once. I was hoping she would reach out and tell me herself, so we could have that conversation, but no. I'm hurt and angry. The conversation we had really meant something and I thought we had bonded in that moment, obviously it meant nothing to her. Every night now, I think about her and her pregnancy and get insanely jealous and am moved now to tears. And it's not just her pregnancy of course, it's the loss of somebody who I thought had become a friend, somebody I did care about. If it wasn't for Jessie, I would forget about Taylor and move on, but I can't do that because they are very close. It's put me in a weird situation where I am stuck in this shitty position and I don't know what to do. Nobody else I know in real life would understand these emotions. I wish I could just be happy for her, but I can't when she won't even talk to me. I feel like she only cared when she thought I could support HER through her own problems, and doesn't actually give a shit about mine. \n\nI need to get over these feelings and don't know how. It's been a few weeks now. If anyone has any advice on how to cope with this, I would love to hear it. Otherwise, thanks for listening to me vent.

And after being on the infertility Ferris wheel for 7 years, I'm kind of happy I'm off.\nHowever, it was brought to our attention that we could use both an egg AND a sperm donor - and I could carry because \"the home is good...just not the people in it.\"  Has anyone else used this method?  Did it work?  \nI like the idea - and mainly because I don't want to succumb to the judging of the adoption process....I mean, seriously - haven't I already been judged enough because we failed 4 IVF's??  But does it make me a monster/selfish?

She mentioned starting a committee and I was really stoked\u2026 until she called it the \u201cfeminism committee\u201d and not the \u201cwomen\u2019s committee.\u201d I was shocked at my reaction \u2013 I literally wanted nothing to do with being labeled a feminist in that moment, despite proudly calling myself a feminist since like 5th grade. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about what has happened recently to make me dislike feminism so much. A lot of it is just my political and moral aversion to \u201cwhite feminism,\u201d which I detest for so many reasons and which may or may not be connected to my second point, which is personal: \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been in my hour of need for years now and feminism is nowhere to be found. If I wanted/needed to have an abortion, not have an abortion, breast-feed, not breast-feed, stay home with a kid, not stay home with a kid, get paid maternity leave, get paid paternity leave, feminism would have my back with 1000 articles and slogans and websites and supportive narratives for why that is a great choice. But infertility? Facing a devastating, gendered medical diagnosis, with no insurance coverage, while battling bullshit misogynistic social narratives at every turn? Fuck you kid, you\u2019re on your own.\n\nI did a literature search once for feminist theory and infertility, and you know what I  found? An academic feminist\u2019s paper about how IVF is a tool of the patriarchy because it colludes politically weak women into \"breeding.\" FUCKING THANKS. Last year, the leftist magazine the Baffler had an article, written by a woman, about how sad and weird it is for couples to pursue donor eggs, and it ended with a sanctimonious \u201cjust adopt\u201d anecdote about some lady who adopted like 8 special-needs kids from foster care. AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY. It\u2019s not just that feminism doesn\u2019t have my back, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t have to look hard to find feminists actually shitting on me.\n\nI don\u2019t like feeling this way. Is there some source of kickass feminist writing on infertility that I\u2019m missing?
