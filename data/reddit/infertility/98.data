A little history, we have secondary infertility due to chromosomal issues and decided to do IVF for this reason.  Also came to find out I have extreme DOR and egg quality issues.  #thisis38 \n\nWe were fortunate to get two genetically perfect embryos.  We transferred the first in May and no dice.  Dr. could not say why it didn't work.  Basically we have ruled out any uterus issue - had some scar tissue after D&amp;C which was removed, did a second hysteroscopy after failed transfer to confirm no additional scarring, and we did a mock biopsy last cycle which confirmed no infection.  The mock also revealed that we were 3-4 days \"early\" on the transfer, so my doctor modified my medicine and timing accordingly for this transfer cycle.\n\nOne issue throughout the three medicated cycles has been a thinner lining.  It has never reached 7mm.  My Dr. did not think it was an issue because my pattern was perfect and that's why we went forward with first transfer.  During the mock my lining got a little thicker, at 6.6, with increased estrogen.  This cycle we added even more estrogen, by including patches, and my estrogen for whatever reason was not quite as high (but still fine) and my lining is only 5.4.  We had a little hiccup with the patches not sticking due to swimming (nobody told me not to swim! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f), Which caused my estrogen to start falling, but we got it back up.  \n\nI thought this might result in a cancellation but my Dr. is still willing to move forward.  He left it up to me to decide, I can always choose to do another mock.  So now I'm left vacillating between going for it and doing a mock and then taking a month off.  I feel like there's nothing wrong with my uterus and the issue was timing which we now know and have adjusted for.  My lining is a nagging thing that makes me wonder.  But I am pretty much convinced it is what it is (we have literally thrown everything at my lining - more estrogen, Viagra, accupuncture, high protein diet, regular exercise, plenty of water).  Also we know from reviewing my history of scans that my lining never gets all that thick.  \n\nSo I'm just wondering what you all think as far as going for it or waiting.  Please don't say \"my Dr says lining has to be 10mm\" because my lining ain't never gonna be that.

None of my eggs even were able to be fertilized, as all 4 were immature when retrieved. 2 matured in the lab, but they didn't fertilize. Obviously we're devastated.\n\nFollow up with our RE (we had a different one for round 1) is Friday morning. I want to have suggestions for the next protocol based on what's given people here good blastocyst outcomes. Here's my history:\n\n**IVF #1:** BCP priming, 14 days. I was on dexamethasone and levothyroxine, Gonal-F 300, Menopur 150. Cetrotide was added in later, I stimmed for 13 days and had a duel trigger with Lupron and HCG 10,000. I had 11 follicles, 6 eggs retrieved, 5 were mature, and 4 fertilized. They looked great day 3, but  only 1 made it to hatching blast, and was frozen. the FET did not take. \n\n**IVF #2:** Accidental 3 months of BCP because of COVID. :/ Then my next CD1 they monitored me for my ovulation, and had me start 20 units of microdose Lupron on 7DPO. I started stims on my next CD3. My antral follicle count was 0 and 1 respectively, I 1000% thought they would cancel my cycle, but they said this was 'normal' for lupron priming. I only really got 6 good looking follicles and still stimmed for 13 days. Though on day 13 they had me take my stims mid-day AND then do my trigger shot in the evening, again 10,000 HCG. 4 eggs, all immature. No embryos at all. \n\nWe were supposed to add magnetic beads to separate sperm for a DNA frag issue we were unaware of in cycle #1, which is what we hoped was the reason why my embryos were arresting around day 5. But we didn't really get to see if this was the case.\n\nIf this happened to you, what would you ask? I really think the Lupron over suppressed me and led to the immaturity issue, as I did not have an issue with my eggs maturing in the first round. We're so crushed and disappointed, and we really trusted this RE. I still do, but I don't think clinics really compensate you if they fuck up your protocol. \n\nThings I might suggest:\n\n\\- no BCP priming  \n\\- no Lupron  \n\\- HGH  \n\\- Mini IVF?\n\nBut looking for what people who have similar issues have done to have better egg retrievals and blast outcomes? What can I bring up with her/what should I ask at the follow up? I'm really hoping to have more say over my protocol this time.

I'm 29yo, and my cycles are usually between 29-31 days. This month, on CD15 my body tried to gear up to ovulate but it didn't seem to happen. I had not much EWCM in the lead up to that. Fast forward to yesterday, CD21, and I have just gotten a strong LH Surge. Still strong today. I have had more EWCM and waiting for temps to rise over the next couple of days (my new bbt thermometer broke on CD16, so don't have accurate temps at the most crucial time). \n\nMy question; is why would I fail to ovulate the first time, leaving me to ovulate very late on CD22? Ovulating this late, I assume causes some issues with infertility? Presumably I will actually ovulate today or tomorrow. A similar situation happened in June also, but all progesterone levels and other hormones fell into normal levels on the 21 day test done this July.

I didn't read these as much but wanted to provide a link to a study that attempts to summarize the research: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501943/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501943/)  Another thing to note is that I saw references to other iron overload disorders but didn't research those, so iron overload is not exclusive to hemochromatosis. Also, a disclaimer -- the last time I took a science class was about 20 years ago, so this is me working with some dated information.   \n\n\nIf you think you might have this, it's helpful to ask for the iron panel blood test, not just the iron blood test: [https://www.hemochromatosis.org/#diagnosis](https://www.hemochromatosis.org/#diagnosis)  If those numbers come back high then you can move onto genetic testing (or at least that was my experience).   I don't think we're allowed to endorse specific companies on this sub; there are companies out there that will do an at-home iron panel.    \n\n\nI have wondered why none of my REs or ObGyns ever issue spotted this for me.  I'm guessing it's because women tend to develop symptoms of iron overload in hemochromatosis later in life than men: if women are having periods, then they are losing blood, and losing blood through a phlebotomy is one of the main treatments for hemochromatosis.  (Once blood is removed, then your body has to pull some of the stored  iron from the organs to make more red blood cells.)

Apologies for delayed responses, I'm at work today, and for how long this is!  \n\nI posted here a while ago about a very negative encounter with a doctor at my facility. When I enrolled at the clinic, there was no rule stating people had to see male providers for ultrasounds/procedures (I throughly reviewed all the information they gave me, and I have a lot of experience reviewing these kinds of documents professionally). My preference for a female provider was always honored and nothing was said about a different policy. \n\nAbout a year ago, a male doctor waltzed in to do an ultrasound, I repeated my preference to have a female doctor and asked him to leave, and he just grilled me as to why and then lectured me that \"If I insisted on this I'd be bumped to the end of the appointment line and it might be hours.\" I, half naked with my feet in stirrups, didn't appreciate his response to me at all, but agreed. They sent in another doctor and I went home, not thinking twice about the encounter.  \n\nI ran into him again during my first IVF round in June, and he was a total a-hole to me during a 90 second interaction. As I was visibly upset after he was rude and condescending to me, a nurse called my usual provider and reported it. I had a follow up call with her where I think I made an error. I was clear to her that the doctor had been a jerk during the June encounter, but had forgotten about the first encounter and didn't mentioned it. I also stated I didn't wish to see male providers as I have mild PTSD and why bother risking it? There was no policy saying I couldn't see a female provider and 90% of the staff is female, so I didn't see why they couldn't accommodate this small request. \n\nApparently they have changed the policy so you have to see whatever provider gets assigned to you, no matter what your situation is. While I think it's a crappy policy (what about people who have religious/severe mental health issues?) I'm willing to abide by it as I don't care enough about seeing male providers to bother switching facilities. My main issue has been the arrogant doctor, which I thought I had explained throughly. \n\nI am a professional, graduate school educated person, so I think I come off well to doctors and not like some unhinged person, but now they're insisting on me taking to a social worker before I can do the next round of IVF. I don't want to talk to the social worker. I don't think it's a good use of my time or money and frankly, why should I have to do this because they have a bad provider?

I talk with my RE on Monday morning.\n\nI'm 38 years old with one ovary and one tube (that's blocked), and stage 3 endo that I had lap surgery for 5 weeks ago. I was supposed to start IVF this month, but...\n\nI had a Sonohystagram 3 days ago and my RE found a random band of scar tissue in my uterus. I've never been pregnant or had surgery on my uterus. As mentioned above, I do have endometriosis (most of which was cleared as much as possible 5 weeks ago), I had my right ovary and tube removed at 17 years old due to an enormous cyst, I had an HSG last year, and a hysteroscopy during my recent lap surgery, but that's it. I should mention during last year's HSG they didn't see anything abnormal and my tube was open. During my surgery 5 weeks ago, they tried the dye in my tube again and it was now blocked.\n\nThe strange thing is, the surgeon (not my RE) never mentioned he found anything in my uterus from the hysteroscopy during my surgery a few weeks ago. Could the scar tissue be from that most recent surgery/hysteroscopy? Can scar tissue actually form that fast, or could they just have missed it? If I had scar tissue in there from endo or a missed infection it is surprising he didn't see it... my RE was like \"wtf??.\" Seems odd that this scar tissue has magically shown up. Whatever the case, it's pretty upsetting as this will hinder our IVF plans. My RE is going to do a hysteroscopy himself and cut the tissue.\n\nI've always had regular periods, 5-6 days (24-26 day cycles), and because of the endometriosis, I can't tell which symptoms may go with what. My periods weren't always painful, I would have an occasional heavy or painful period, but they weren't the norm. I also have a bit of IBS, so I would have cramps throughout my cycle at times muddying the waters.\n\nI feel very defeated and want to know how to best approach next steps with my RE. I have read that estrogen and balloon therapy seems to work... Since January I have had one complication after another (including a very painful endometrioma which almost cost me my only ovary)... we were devastated to find out my only tube was blocked and due to all the other factors IVF was our best chance. Financially it will be very hard. Now with this seemingly unexplained scar tissue, it feels like my body is just saying \"no.\"\n\nBefore the scar tissue was discovered, our odds of IVF success were given as 30% (ugh). Now I feel like this new complication lessens that even further. I almost don't even want to bother doing IVF now (like, is it worth the emotional, physical and financial struggle for such a low chance?), but feel like I can't give up for my partner's sake.

I already seem to be a low/poor responder to stims. My RE listened to my fears (even though she thinks it's not possible for ovaries to just shut down form a few months of Lupron) and she is considering an agonist protocol for me instead, but we're going to talk about protocol in more detail in 2 weeks after she looks into a few things for me. \n\nI feel like she's trying to address the endo, but my AMH is also low at 6pmol (0.84ng/mL I think). I feel like the endo is less of an issue and I'm more concerned with getting more good quality eggs, and my last cycle with microdose Lupron was the worst one so far. She said that the Lupron would not have affected maturity, but I didn't have this issue when I didn't prime with Lupron. She said I responded well to the meds and my follicles were appropriately sized to have mature eggs, they just didn't. It was also less follicles than my first round. \n\nNow I'm anxious because:\n\n\\- What if I trust my RE's Lupron plan and it goes terribly again  \n\\- What if she listens to me and I'm wrong and it also goes terribly   \n\\- I turn 35 next year and that basically is where my next retrieval would be if we do the Lupron thing and I feel like age/time is not on my side for the Lupron plan. \n\nAnyone with endo/DOR have a depo Lupron before retrieval? I have heard of people having success with it as prep for transfers, but it always seems to me that it seems like a bad idea before retreivals due to ovarian suppression.

We\u2019ve been trying to conceive for two years. I\u2019ve had three pregnancies in that time, all of which ended in loss. #1 took six cycles to conceive and ended in miscarriage at 8w due to trisomy 16; #2 took three cycles to conceive and ended in termination at 15w due to trisomy 13; #3 took seven cycles to conceive and ended in miscarriage at 11w due to trisomy 13.\n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve struggled with multiple losses, particularly due to chromosomal issues: did you get any additional testing that you found helpful? How did you decide on next steps? We\u2019ll be meeting with our OB and a genetic counselor soon, and I want to make sure we advocate for ourselves well.\n\nWe\u2019re leaning towards giving up on trying to conceive on our own and moving to IVF so we can do PGS, since all of our losses have been due to aneuploidies.

I was a stupid teenager who simply acted out of fear of getting in trouble, trying to get away from an abusive situation (thankfully it marked the end of that relationship when the guy took me to the clinic and called me a bitch and a c**t, then left me there alone).  It was unknown to everyone except the guy and a few very close friends.  No one in my family ever found out and it\u2019s become  my deep dark secret that I suffer worsening PTSD and depression and anxiety over to this day.  Some days it feels too real and everything takes me back to that time frame, some days I wonder if it even happened because I tried to block it out.  I should have seen a counselor, but it\u2019s now been almost 10 years and without health insurance, I just still suffer through this mentally everyday.  In addition, I was diagnosed with an STD last summer and not sure how long I had it (needless to say - health and sexual education was essentially non-existent for me growing up).  I worry about the consequences for myself.  I have not started \u201ctrying\u201d per day, but my SO and I have been having unprotected sex for over a year now with no luck.  I worry I am infertile but I just don\u2019t have the money to make an appointment to get checked out.  I also worry about what I think might be inevitable - that I did too much damage to my body before I was ready to actually have kids.  I know I want a baby with my SO and he is pushing for it, but I feel like the universe is punishing me and deep down, I feel like I don\u2019t deserve it anymore either after my mistakes.  \n\nFast forward to today, I am *very* triggered by anything pregnancy/baby-related.  I cannot mention the word abortion out loud.  It brings out feelings I cannot control, even when I know they are irrational or wrong.  These feelings include extreme jealousy, selfishness, trauma, depression, anxiety. regret, pure anger, frustration, sadness, loss, and devastation.  My SO has a 10 year old daughter who I just can\u2019t seem to love.  My younger sister got pregnant out of high school with a dead beat and I have NEVER been able to interact with my niece - never held her, refuse to watch her or play with her, etc.  These thoughts make me cry.  I don\u2019t WANT to feel this way.  But I can\u2019t help it.  I want to be happy for these people that are close to me, but I struggle so much with it.  \n\nNow this past week, my best friend has announced that she is 12 weeks pregnant and sent me the baby announcement and her ultrasound photos.  I have hit a new low.  I managed to smile and say congrats before I broke down.  I am so angry and upset and sad.  I have been crying for days.  I can\u2019t find a way to be happy for her.  She isn\u2019t in the best boat herself in my opinion.  She just got out of an abusive relationship and was living with me for 4 months, then met a new guy on Tinder.  They have only been officially dating for 2 months after meeting him in person 3-4 months ago, he lives out of state, she switches low-income jobs every 6 months, and she has very minimal family support because of poor relationships with her parents.  I consider her to be one of my only true female friends.  But I\u2019m fighting feelings of hatred towards her right now (completely unwarranted I know) and I feel like I just want her to struggle more.  I feel so evil inside.  I just know I am going to lose her friendship now.  I love her and would like to be in a healthy enough mental state to support her, but I have too much unresolved internal pain and unanswered questions about my own fertility and now no where to turn to, so I am taking it out on everyone when I\u2019m the only one to blame...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19642, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "At my tipping point...", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i7242b/at_my_tipping_point/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ModusOperandiAlpha", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "40F-3RPL-1TFMR-2IVF-FET1prep", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_38va2cuu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597056710, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i72m79/faq_what_ive_learned_about_pgs_pgta/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i72m79", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 39, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/i72m79/faq_what_ive_learned_about_pgs_pgta/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597056721, "score": 1, "selftext": "**This is for the wiki.**\u00a0 As you can see, this is a LONG post; despite that, it still doesn\u2019t cover everything.\u00a0 The hyperlinked citations are just *some* of the research/literature available on the topic, there is plenty more out there.

Useful definitions.\n**PGS** stands for \u201cpreimplantation genetic screening\u201d: screening one or more embryos for certain genetic content, in order to help decide *whether* to attempt to transfer the screened embryo into an uterus, and if so *in what order* (e.g., to rank the order in which embryos will be used to attempt transfer, if at all). In broad terms, such testing is generally done by taking a biopsy of several cells from the trophectoderm of a developing embryo (the part that may eventually develop into a placenta\u00a0https://www.utahfertility.com/understanding-embryo-grading/\u00a0[see figures 4 &amp; 5]), and running various tests on those biopsied cells. What types of tests are run depends upon what type of pre-implantation genetic screening is being conducted.\n\u00a0\n**PGT-A** (\u201cpreimplantation genetic testing \u2013 aneuploidy\u201d, sometimes also referred to as **CCS** \u2013 comprehensive chromosome screening) is a particular type of PGS, which screens embryos for numerical chromosomal aneuploidy to determine whether the embryo has the proper number of chromosomes. (https://ormgenomics.com/2018/09/20/pgt-what-does-it-all-mean/ ) There are also other types of preimplantation genetic screening, which screen for other types of genetic anomalies (**PGT-SR**, which screens for structural rearrangements, e.g., translocations, within a particular chromosome; **PGD** [preimplantation diagnosis] / **PGT-M**, which screens for single-gene / inheritable diseases and syndromes).\u00a0 *Ibid.* \u00a0**Most commonly, when people refer to \u201cPGS\u201d generically, they are usually referring to screening for numerical chromosomal aneuploidy, i.e., PGT-A, even though the term actually has a broader meaning.** Likewise, older literature sometimes uses the terms \u201cPGS\u201d and \u201cPGD\u201d interchangeably, whereas more recent literature is more careful to use the more specific meanings.\n\n#WHAT PROBLEMS IS PGT-A SCREENING TRYING TO SOLVE? WHAT OUTCOMES IS PGT-A TRYING TO IMPROVE?\nGenetic aneuploidy in an embryo, and in particular non-inherited *numerical chromosomal aneuploidy* in embryos (having the wrong number of chromosomes) is by far the primary cause of post-conception pregnancy loss (in particular chemical pregnancies and miscarriages at other stages), accounting for roughly 40-65% of all pregnancy losses/miscarriages: this is true for both spontaneously conceived pregnancies, and for IVF/ICSI pregnancies. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4729087/ ; https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2018/11/early-pregnancy-loss ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4736891/#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20chromosomal%20abnormalities%20are,to%20test%20aneuploidy%20in%20miscarriage. ; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-009-9292-z.\u00a0 Certain types of chromosomal aneuploidies can cause either pregnancy loss (or implantation failure), or in other instances can cause congenital health problems in a resulting child.\u00a0 E.g., trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome); trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome); trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome); Turner Syndrome (whole or partial monosomy X); Klinefelter syndrome (XXY).\n\u00a0\nSo, the idea is that avoiding the transfer of embryos with demonstrated genetic aneuploidy would logically (1) reduce the rate of post-transfer pregnancy loss and the rate of congenital birth defects; and conversely (2) increase the rate of successful live birth in general, and increase the rate of successful live birth without congenital defects in particular. Presumably, this increase in success rates *on a per-transfer basis* would also (3) reduce the time it takes (and the number of transfers it takes) to achieve a live birth. *One or all of these three goals are generally what PGT-A is used to try to achieve.*\n\u00a0\n*But, how to know whether the embryos you have available are chromosomally aneuploid or not?*\n\u00a0\nThe morphology of a blastocyst-stage embryo \u2013 what its shape looks like visually (aka its \u201cgrade\u201d) is very subjective, and isn\u2019t a great predictor of whether an embryo is/isn\u2019t chromosomally competent to potentially result in a live birth of a genetically normal baby.\u00a0 Although \u201cbetter\u201d graded embryos more frequently tend to be **euploid** (having the correct set of 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes plus one pair of sex chromosomes for a total of 23 pairs/46 total chromosomes) than \u201cpoorer\u201d graded embryos, this isn\u2019t always true; and attempting to detect aneuploidy/euploidy based on morphology/grading has a high rate of error (in the range of approximately 30%-60% equivalent error rate). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405648/ ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6133810/ ; https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/29/6/1173/624854 [\u201cA moderate relation between blastocyst morphology and CCS data was observed but *the ability to implant seems to be mainly determined by the chromosomal complement of preimplantation embryos rather than developmental and morphological parameters* conventionally used for blastocyst evaluation\u201d (emphasis added)] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5982556/.) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs discussed below, **in comparison to embryo morphology/grading, PGT-A is a better predictor of whether an embryo is/isn\u2019t chromosomally competent to potentially result in a live birth of a genetically normal baby**.\u00a0 And, although it isn\u2019t 100% accurate, PGT-A it is the best predictor presently available.\n\u00a0\n##RELEVANT HISTORY OF PGS/PGT-A SCREENING &amp; A NOTE ABOUT PRE-2016 LITERATURE/RESEARCH.\nPGS/PGT-A screening is a very new and rapidly developing tool. Prior to about 2013-2016, physicians, embryologists, and researchers used different techniques for PGS/PGT-A than they do today. The medical field went from not testing for chromosomal aneuploidy at all, to testing for only a few chromosomes within the biopsy, to \u2014 starting in about 2013-2016 \u2014 testing for all 23 sets of chromosomes; went from using slower embryo freezing technologies to using the almost-immediate vitrification freezing approach, which now has higher rates of successful thawing and has minimized the small likelihood of damage to the embryo in that process; went from reporting only \u201cnormal\u201d vs \u201cabnormal\u201d determinations regarding each tested embryo, to reporting the more specific \u201cnormal\u201d, \u201cabnormal\u201d, \u201cmosaic\u201d, and \u201cno result\u201d (further discussion of these reported result types below); improved biopsy and Petri dish culturing methods; and so on. The end result (so far) of these improvements has been increased accuracy of testing; reduced likelihood of embryo damage/embryo loss from the PGT-A biopsy/freezing/screening process; and, when PGT-A screened \u201cnormal\u201d embryos are transferred, increased implantation rates and reduced pregnancy loss rates (and corollary increased live birth rates on a per-transfer basis). (https://ivf-worldwide.com/cogen/oep/pgd-pgs/history-of-pgd-and-pgs.html\u00a0;\u00a0https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6333033/\u00a0;\u00a0https://www.ivf-hub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Scott-Typeset-for-publishing-v4-28SEP2019.pdf\u00a0).\n\u00a0\nSince these technologies and techniques were only developed and came into broader use between roughly 2013-2016 and the present, the related scientific research discussing these newer techniques only began to be published in approximately 2013-2016, at the earliest. So, it is important to note that *research papers discussing PGS/PGT-A which were published prior to about 2016, or which were published later but examine research conducted prior to about 2016, often (but not always) pertain to techniques which are no longer in widespread use today*, and as a result the findings of such research papers may not be applicable to the PGS/PGT-A screening being offered by REs today.\n\u00a0\n#How does it work?\u00a0 What do the lab folks do in PGT-A?\nFor PGT-A, an embryologist takes a biopsy of cells from the trophectoderm** (outer rim of cells that may develop into a placenta of a 5-7 day embryo (**blastocyst**), and then sends them to a separate lab for analysis.\u00a0 That separate lab amplifies the genetic data within the biopsied cells/cell lines, and runs various tests to determine whether the cell lines/genetic data derived from those biopsied cells have the correct number of each chromosome (**euploid** cells having 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes plus one pair of sex chromosomes for a total of 23 pairs/46 total chromosomes); or an incorrect number of one or more of the sets of chromosomes (**aneuploid**); or some cell lines with the correct number of chromosomes and some cell lines with an incorrect number of chromosomes (a **mosaic** biopsy). \n\u00a0\n#Understanding your PGT-A lab report.\nAfter running the screening process, the lab reports the findings of these trophectoderm biopsies as follows: Normal, abnormal, mosaicism, or \u201cno result\u201d. There are some methodological nuances that differ based on the specific type of PGT-A test done and may differ from lab to lab, but generally speaking, for a particular embryo, if all of the cell lines/amplified DNA content derived from that embryo\u2019s biopsy are euploid the embryo is reported as \u201c**normal**\u201d; if all of the cell lines/amplified DNA content derived from that embryo\u2019s biopsy are aneuploid the embryo is reported as \u201c**abnormal**\u201d; and if some of the cell lines/amplified DNA derived from that embryo\u2019s biopsy are euploid and some are aneuploid, then the embryo is reported as \u201c**mosaic**\u201d.\u00a0 (Further explanation of mosaicism here: https://www.coopergenomics.com/blog/during-ivf/mosaicism-what-we-know-what-we-dont-know/) *Note, however, that some labs still report embryos with mosaic biopsies as \u201cabnormal\u201d \u2013 if you are considering PGT-A testing, you should ask your RE whether the lab they use reports mosaics.*  Based on these reported results, \u201cnormal\u201d embryos would be preferred for transfer because they have the highest likelihood of success, mosaic embryos might be considered for transfer but are not preferred (further discussion below), and \u201cabnormal\u201d embryos are generally discarded (donated to science or whatever you contracted with your RE to do with them when you signed the PGS/PGT-A paperwork). \n\u00a0\n##Concordance / Discordance between the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass.\nWhen designating an embryo \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cabnormal\u201d or \u201cmosaic\u201d based on the trophectoderm biopsy, PGT-A screening assumes that the cells in the trophectoderm of the embryo (which can develop into a placenta if all goes well) match the cells in the inner cell mass of the embryo (which can develop into a fetus if all goes well). In other words, assumes that there is \u201cconcordance\u201d between the cells in these two parts of the embryo.\u00a0 It appears that there is usually \u2013 but not always \u2013 concordance between the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass: concordance rates seem to be somewhere between 86% - 97%. (https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/24/12/593/5145914 ; https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/26/4/269/5721558\u00a0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6262631/ ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1472648319301579 ; https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31359-6/pdf .)\u00a0 Thus, *although the PGT-A process is pretty reliable, it is not 100% accurate* (and, no one worth their salt claims it is \u2013 even the PGS labs acknowledge this [e.g., Progenesis reports approximately 98% accuracy rate/2% error rate, https://www.progenesis.com/overview-of-pgd-technology/ ]; Igenomix, same rates, https://www.igenomix.com/genetic-solutions/pgt-a-preimplantation-genetic-testing-aneuploidies/ ; \u00a0Cooper Genomics, same rates https://www.coopergenomics.com/blog/during-ivf/mosaicism-what-we-know-what-we-dont-know/]).\n\u00a0\n**Note:** The research behind trophectoderm/inner cell mass concordance (matching) or discordance (not matching) is still developing and is a very new (and therefore contentious) area of research.\u00a0 Some reasons that have been proposed to explain incidents of discordance between the euploid/aneuploid status of an embryo\u2019s trophectoderm/inner cell mass include:\u00a0 errors introduced in the laboratory processes (e.g., accidental contamination during biopsy, cell growth, etc.); embryos \u201crepairing\u201d themselves during development by \u201cpushing\u201d aneuploid cells out of the inner cell mass and into the trophectoderm, thereby tending to result in a euploid inner cell mass but reflecting trophectoderm cells which read as aneuploid or mosaic when biopsied; mosaicism in trophectoderm cells being more common and less problematic than previously thought, therefore resulting in a more common baseline range of discordance between the inner cell mass and trophectoderm of embryos in general.\u00a0 This is still an emerging area of research.\n\u00a0\n##What if your PGT-A lab result is \u201cNo result\u201d?\nIf for some reason the lab was not able to determine the chromosomal status of the cells biopsied from a particular embryo, that is reported as \u201c**no result**\u201d or \u201cno DNA\u201d or \u201cno diagnosis\u201d or similar phrasing. This could happen for any number of reasons, including but not limited to: too few cells obtained in the biopsy, contamination or damage to the biopsy in the lab or in transit, the biopsied cells failed to grow, sufficient DNA to run the tests couldn\u2019t be extracted from the biopsied cells, etc.  If this happens, you may have the option of thawing that embryo, having it re-biopsied (and then re-frozen) and screened again. As you might expect, this second biopsy process increases the risk of damage to the embryo, although the vast majority survive the process and are able to re-thaw for later transfer if necessary. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24794643/\u00a0;\u00a0https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(16)61897-6/pdf\u00a0;\u00a0https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31343-2/fulltext ) And, if a PGT-A screened \u201cnormal\u201d twice-biopsied embryo is transferred, there does not seem to be a significant reduction in the chance of live birth versus a \u201cnormal\u201d embryo that was only biopsied once. (https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(18)30156-0/fulltext).  However, as you might imagine, the body of research on this topic is very small, so especially in this area your mileage may vary. \n\n#IS PGT-A RIGHT FOR YOU? THINGS TO CONSIDER &amp; DISCUSS WITH YOUR RE WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO PURSUE PGS/PGT-A SCREENING.\n###Philosophical / religious considerations.\nPGT-A screening does involve taking cells from each embryo for biopsy; and, although with current techniques the rates of embryo damage/loss have been reduced and are low, they are not zero. And, embryos whose biopsies are reported as \u201cabnormal\u201d will virtually always be discarded. If any of that doesn\u2019t jive with your personal beliefs or preferences, then PGT-A screening is probably not for you.\n\u00a0\n###Will you have the opportunity to do a frozen embryo transfer (\u201cFET\u201d)?\nLogistically, because of how long it takes to conduct the laboratory processes and report the results, PGT-A screening cannot be conducted on an embryo that will be used for a fresh transfer (although if additional blastocysts are available you still may be able to do PGT-A on any other blastocysts that result from that egg retrieval cycle).\u00a0 This might happen if you are participating in a shared risk program that requires a fresh transfer; or if there are cleavage-stage embryos available but they don\u2019t look likely to survive/develop to blastocyst stage so would need to be transferred ASAP in order to have a chance; etc. \n\u00a0\n###Timing concerns &amp; Whether you are trying to bank embryos.\nSome insurance coverages require you to attempt transfer of all available embryos before the insurance will cover another egg retrieval cycle.\u00a0 If so, using PGT-A to pare down the number of embryos available for potential transfer (by designating any \u201cabnormal\u201d and/or \u201cmosaic\u201d embryos as unavailable for transfer) may help reduce the number of transfers you will have to attempt (and therefore the time those take) before you would become eligible for another covered egg retrieval.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLikewise, the initial FET process itself, and the resolution of any subsequent pregnancy loss from an unsuccessful transfer, both can take significant time \u2013 weeks or months depending upon your particular circumstances. So, if you improve your per-transfer success rate, you may be able to reach the end goal of a live birth with fewer FET attempts (and therefore sooner) than if you had attempted to transfer each un-screened embryo consecutively.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n###Would you want to have the option to transfer a mosaic embryo? Will your RE transfer a mosaic embryo?\nVirtually all REs will refuse to transfer an embryo whose PGT-A biopsy has been reported as \u201cabnormal\u201d. So, if you think you might want to have the option of transferring a mosaic embryo (e.g., if no remaining \u201cnormal\u201d embryos are available), it is important to find out ahead of time (1) whether the lab that will screen your embryo biopsies reports mosaic results as \u201cabnormal\u201d or as \u201cmosaic\u201d, and (2) what is your RE\u2019s policy regarding the possibility of transferring mosaic embryos.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor REs who will consider transferring mosaic embryos, a common approach is to rank embryos for transfer as follows: first, \u201cnormal\u201d embryos that also have \u201cgood\u201d morphology/grading (if any); second, \u201cnormal\u201d embryos that have lesser morphology/grading (if any); then mosaic embryos last (if any). Further, there may be particular types of aneuploidy demonstrated in a mosaic embryo regarding which you (or your RE) may not be comfortable transferring. When deciding whether to transfer a mosaic embryo, you may find it helpful to consult with a genetic counselor: most labs which run PGT-A testing also provide phone access to genetic counselors. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n###How many blastocysts are in play?\nIf there are no blastocysts available for biopsy, PGT-A screening is obviously not an option.\u00a0 Similarly, if your egg retrieval results in only a few blastocysts (one, two, three, etc.), it may be more time efficient and financially efficient to proceed with transferring one or more of those embryos without PGT-A screening; and the impact of risking potential damage to those few embryos or the impact of risking potential erroneous screening (potentially resulting in no blastocysts to transfer) may be relatively more important.\u00a0 **Note**: This is often why critics of PGT-A correctly point out that, while PGT-A may increase the rate of success on a *per-transfer* basis, for patients who are less likely to yield any or many blastocysts in a particular egg retrieval cycle (e.g., due to POF, DOR, ovary loss, reduced response to stims, or any other reason), PGT-A isn\u2019t particularly helpful and may not increase the likelihood of success on a *per-cycle* basis.\n\u00a0\nConversely, if your egg retrieval cycle results in many embryos, it may be more time efficient, financially efficient, and potentially more emotionally tolerable to proceed with PGT-A screening to pare down the number of blastocysts to only those that are reported as \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cmosaic\u201d, so as to avoid spending time, money, and emotional energy trying to transfer embryos with no or very low likelihood of success (e.g., by weeding out known \u201cabnormals\u201d) trying to find the proverbial \u201cnormal\u201d needle in the haystack.\n\u00a0\nWhat the magic number is for you will of course depend on your own personal circumstances and appetite for risk \u2013 e.g., Will you proceed with PGT-A no matter how many blastocysts you get? Only if you get 3 or more? Only if you get 8 or more? Something else?\n\u00a0\n###How much will PGT-A cost in general? And, is that cost more or less than the cost of a frozen embryo transfer (\u201cFET\u201d)?\nPGT-A screening isn\u2019t cheap, and is not affordable for everyone.\u00a0 *Just like PGT-A isn\u2019t a guarantee of success, if you can\u2019t afford PGT-A or otherwise decide not to pursue it, that\u2019s not a guarantee of failure either.*\n\u00a0\nDepending upon the lab and your RE clinic, PGT-A screening is sometimes paid for on a per-embryo basis, and sometimes paid for as a flat rate for screening several embryos at once (e.g., often a flat rate for screening up to 8 embryos).\u00a0 So, this is another layer of decision-making to consider when determining what your \u201cmagic number\u201d might be.\n\u00a0\nIf you end up with many blastocysts, it may be overall less expensive to pay to proceed with PGT-A screening so as to reduce the number of blastocysts you would consider transferring, and concurrently increasing your chances of success on a per-transfer basis; than it would be to pay for multiple consecutive FETs trying to transfer each embryo one at a time (or even two at a time).\u00a0 Of course, the math of these finances will depend upon the costs of FETs at your clinic, the costs of FET medications, what you may have to pay for PGT-A, and how many blastocysts you have available/want to test.\n\u00a0\n###Does PGT-A screening require the use of ICSI, or can it be done with plain-vanilla IVF?\nPGT-A screening does not inherently require the use of more-expensive ICSI; the PGT-A biopsying can also be done in an IVF cycle.\u00a0 However, it is common for RE clinics to require ICSI when opting for PGT-A.\u00a0 While ICSI may not be necessary in general, it may be that your RE/embryologist feels more comfortable doing PGT-A biopsy when they\u2019ve had control over the entire embryo-creation process from the start (i.e., including selection of the sperm with which to fertilize the egg); they may feel they get better results/less embryo loss/damage when they do biopsy after ICSI versus after IVF;\u2026 or they straight up may be trying to squeeze you for extra money (because ICSI costs more than IVF).\u00a0 If you are concerned about this, talk to your clinic about whether (and why) they do/don\u2019t require ICSI with PGT-A.\n\u00a0\n###Is using PGT-A screening likely to improve YOUR chances of success? The impacts of egg age.\nAs noted above, chromosomal aneuploidy is the primary cause of pregnancy loss.\u00a0 The rates of incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy (and pregnancy loss due to aneuploidy) increase dramatically with age; and this is true for both spontaneous pregnancies, and ART pregnancies. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC27416/ ; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075953. The likelihood of a particular embryo being aneuploid depends a lot on the **age of the eggs being used** (the age of the woman from whom the eggs were retrieved, whether a donor or autologous cycle). **This article sets out the percentage rates of \u201cnormal\u201d vs. \u201cabnormal\u201d embryos based on maternal/egg age**, and also has a very useful discussion of the likelihood of obtaining any blastocysts to test in the first place based on maternal/egg age: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216000662 (if you want the cliff-notes version, scroll down to the colorful graphs).\n\u00a0\nSo, although reducing the rate of incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy would be helpful for reducing the likelihood of pregnancy loss in women of any age, generally\u00a0 speaking reducing the incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy has the greatest impact for those women who are older (because their embryos are more likely to be aneuploid in the first place) and lesser impact for those women who are younger (because their embryos are less likely to be aneuploid in the first place).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA quick and dirty way to understand this is to filter the \u202aSART.org\u202c national reports to compare live birth rates for those using PGT-A versus those not using PGT-A.\u00a0 For example, based on the most recent complete data set available (the 2017 SART National Report https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?reportingYear=2017), women aged 35 or younger who *did not* use PGT-A had a live birth success rate *per first transfer* of 46.7%, while the live birth success rate *per first transfer* for women of the same age who *did* use PGT-A was 57% (an improvement of about 10%).\u00a0 Conversely, women aged 38-40 who *did not* use PGT-A had an overall *per first transfer* live birth success rate of 27.7%, while the *per first transfer* live birth success rate for women of the same age who *did* use PGT-A was 52.9% (an improvement of about 25%).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther research bears this out (i.e., that use of PGT-A for embryos created using eggs from women aged 35 years or younger has less dramatic impact on outcome than the use of PGT-A for embryos created using eggs from women older than that). \u00a0(See, e.g., https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-018-01399-1 ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0015028217302546 ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455919300130 )\n\u00a0\nFor this reason, many REs recommend against using PGT-A on the blastocysts of younger women, on the grounds that the margin of expected improvement may not be worth the extra monetary cost/small risk to the embryo.\u00a0 However, whether that is the right approach for your particular circumstance is really up to you.\n\u00a0\n###Is using PGT-A screening likely to improve YOUR chances of success? The impacts of pregnancy loss history &amp; transfer history.\nThe use of PGT-A has also been demonstrated to be beneficial for patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and/or repeat implantation failure (RIF), more or less evening the playing field to result in success rates closer to those experienced by younger-egg-aged patients without RPL or RIF. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455919300130 ; https://www.asrm.org/news-and-publications/news-and-research/press-releases-and-bulletins/preimplantation-genetic-testing-for-chromosomal-defects-improves-ivf-outcomes-in-patients-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/ . \n\u00a0\n###Your tolerance for risk.\nAs noted above, although with current techniques the rates of embryo damage/loss have been reduced and are low, they are not zero. And, although the level of concordance between the biopsied trophectoderm cells (the part that might develop into a placenta) and the inner cell mass of the embryo (the part that\u00a0 might develop into a fetus) is high, it is also not 100%; hence the roughly 2% error rate reported by PGS labs. In light of the fact that embryos whose biopsies are reported as \u201cabnormal\u201d will virtually always be discarded, if you are not willing to accept that level of risk of embryo damage, or risk of discarding an embryo that was reported as \u201cabnormal\u201d but was actually euploid or mosaic, then PGT-A screening is probably not for you.\n\u00a0\nConversely, if you would prefer to take steps to try to increase the likelihood of live birth on a per-transfer basis by reducing the risk of implantation failure or pregnancy loss (e.g., if you are not willing to tolerate your baseline risk of implantation failure/pregnancy loss based on your egg age), then PGT-A screening may be a good choice for you.\n\u00a0\n##WHAT PGT-A CAN &amp; CAN\u2019T DO. MORE PROS &amp; CONS.\nPGT-A can\u2019t fix or change aneuploid embryos: at most it may be able to identify them.\n\u00a0\nPGT-A is a useful tool, but it is not a guarantee of success. Critics of PGT-A screening often express concern that ART patients may get the impression that using PGT-A screening makes IVF/ICSI a sure thing. But, as noted above, the per-transfer live birth rates for couples using PGT-A screening is in the 50-60% range. So, although it is a good tool in many instances, it\u2019s not a silver bullet.\n\u00a0\nPGT-A presently cannot consistently detect genetic anomalies smaller than the presence of too few or too many of a particular chromosome: metaphorically, it can identify missing or duplicate chapters (chromosomes) within the genetic book, but it cannot identify typographical errors within those chapters. For example, PGT-A screening is not used to detect microdeletions or microadditions within or among chromosomes; or translocations where genetic material is present, but it is located in a problematic place within the chromosome. All of those things can cause an embryo to develop improperly, or fail to implant, or cause pregnancy loss, or cause congenital health problems for a resulting child. Other types of testing may be available to address these issues (e.g., PGT-SR to identify translocations), but that\u2019s beyond the scope of this post.\n\u00a0\nPGT-A presently can sometimes \u2013 but not always \u2013 detect genetic anomalies in which the cells of the biopsied embryo contain too many copies of the *entire set* of chromosomes (**polyploid**): metaphorically, it can identify when the genetic book contains duplicates of some chapters, but it cannot always identify when there are too many duplicated books. For example, **triploidy** is a type of chromosomal aneuploidy in which there are 3 entire sets of chromosomes within the cell (i.e., 69 chromosomes instead of the usual 46). Similarly, **tetraploidy** is a type of chromosomal aneuploidy in which there are 4 sets of chromosomes within the cell (i.e., 96 chromosomes instead of the usual 46).\u00a0 https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/triploidy/ ; https://ir.invitae.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Invitae-Presents-Validation-of-a-Novel-NGS-based-Preimplantation-Genetic-Screening-Technology-to-Identify-the-Most-Frequent-Chromosomal-Causes-of-Miscarriage/default.aspx ; https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31324-9/pdf ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637680/ ; https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/veriseq-pgs/veriseq-pgs-technical-guide-to-aneuploidy-calling-15059470-a.pdf . All of those things can cause an embryo to develop improperly, or fail to implant, or cause pregnancy loss, or cause congenital health problems for a resulting child.\n\u00a0\n**I\u2019m sure there is plenty that you know about PGS/PGT-A that I\u2019ve missed (or just not been able to fit into this post), so please comment to fill in the blanks.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve read this far, thanks for your patience/diligence!**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19643, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "FAQ: What I\u2019ve learned about PGS / PGT-A", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i72m79/faq_what_ive_learned_about_pgs_pgta/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597057745, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i72tvm/user_flair_reminder/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i72tvm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Reminder", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/i72tvm/user_flair_reminder/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597057756, "score": 1, "selftext": "Please set up user flair which includes information on your age, diagnosis, treatment status, and current status.

I\u2019m posting here looking for guidance/advice on what to expect at my first fertility consultation. Because of COVID it will be a phone consultation. If you can give me any guidance on what testing/treatments to advocate for I\u2019d really appreciate it. Here is my story: \n\n- I am 28(F) and husband is 31(M) \n- We had a miscarriage in 2017 @5 weeks and then waited to TTC again until after we got married (IUD placed)\n- I had a LEEP in 2017 \n- We started actively trying in Jan 2019 (IUD removed). I charted, temped, used OPKs, timed intercourse, the whole thing. My cycles are regular 26-28 and I ovulate normally. \n- June 2019 my husband had his sperm checked which came back as okay. \n- Nov 2019 we finally conceived after 11 failed cycles. However, in Jan 2020 it was found to be a missed miscarriage. I had a D&amp;C at 10weeks. I stopped tracking my cycles at this point besides logging period days. \n- April 2020 I had a miscarriage at 5weeks. \n- My husband and I had bloodwork done to check for genetic diseases, which came back as normal. I had an RPL done which came back as a \u201cweak positive\u201d for anti-phospholipid syndrome. I was re-tested and it was a \u201cweak positive\u201d again. I was sent to a hematologist who said I don\u2019t meet the criteria for diagnosis and suggested I take a daily dose of aspirin. I had bloodwork for things like STDs, thyroid, etc and everything is normal. \n- I had an ultrasound done in July that noted \u201cendometrial cysts\u201d (it gave no # or size so my doctor took this to mean it was insignificant data), and they found a hemorrhagic cyst on my right ovary. However, it turns out I was 4 weeks pregnant at this ultrasound - with an ectopic pregnancy so unsure of those findings? (They did not see the pregnancy on the ultrasound, I had beta HCGs the same week that confirmed it). I was placed on progesterone for the pregnancy. \n- Last week, at 8 weeks along I went to the hospital after experiencing pain (no bleeding) and it was discovered I was having the ectopic pregnancy. It ruptured and I lost my right tube. This marked my 4th loss. \n- This morning the fertility clinic called to set up my first consultation. At this point I am terrified to keep trying, and feel lost. What questions should I be asking them? What testing should I have? Would moving to IUI\u2019s be better for us? What is our outcome now that I only have one tube? \n\n**Trigger Warning: Relevant past medical history mentioning living children** \n&gt;!I have two living children from a previous relationship. There were no issues with their conception/pregnancies. My husband does not have bio children.!&lt;\n\nIf anyone could offer advice or guidance I would really appreciate it. I feel lost and hopeless, my body is broken and we aren\u2019t sure if we can mentally keep moving forward when everything just ends in loss for us....

Three years ago my husband and I started trying to conceive. After a year of timing cycles and trying any advice we could get (including the dreaded \"just relax\") we went to a reproductive endocrinologist and I was diagnosed with premature ovarian failure 1 month before my 30th birthday. We proceeded with IVF, had a fantastic retrieval day with 10 eggs all successfully fertilized. 7 made it to blastocyst stage and 5 were genetically viable for transfer. Due to job related circumstances we ended up moving across the country with plans to come back in a few years and try our embryo transfer. \nInitially things were going really well and our relationship felt stronger than ever, then around March my husband became distant. I tried to plan the things we loved doing and gently ask what was wrong without much progress. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when my husband finally shared he is just no longer in love with me and doesn't want to be married anymore. \nMy world is shattered. I thought that infertility was going to be my biggest life hurdle but now I am facing the idea of having to start over completely. My relationship is an aspect I know is better discussed on other subreddits, but I felt that you ladies would best understand my grief about losing these 5 embryos that had so much hope for me.\nI have an appointment with another reproductive endocrinologist to see if there is any possibility I might be able to try egg retrieval again, but I worry based on my last AMH over a year ago that my chance will have passed \ud83d\ude2a", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19656, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Infertile, divorcing and feeling lost", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i7avot/infertile_divorcing_and_feeling_lost/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597086353, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i7b865/monday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i7b865", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Daily", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 67, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/i7b865/monday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597086364, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!

If I am on the pill consistently for about 16 months I would barely get one but I\u2019ve only been back on for 3 months. So I am wondering if anybody else has used this medication and if you were able to start without getting your period? If your period was used to start things up or just for a timeline to date the pregnancy better? \n\nWe got the okay to start this month, I would be taking the letrozole in about a week but I am worried on what to do if I don\u2019t get my period in regards to the medication and like I mention I was unable to get an appointment until mid next month but that would be 2 cycles without answers and 2 cycles we would miss out on trying. \n\nThank you for any advice!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19661, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Fertility Question regarding medication", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i7iyc4/fertility_question_regarding_medication/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SLT6", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "31F | HA+Lean PCOS | IVF | 1EP", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_10qi8o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597113209, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i7jecn/meds_donation_dotti_patches/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i7jecn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "X", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/i7jecn/meds_donation_dotti_patches/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597113220, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have 3 boxes of 0.1 mg Dotti patches (8 patches per box, so a total of 24).\nThey expire in 06-07/2021.\nHappy to cover shipping to whoever needs them!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 19662, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Meds Donation - Dotti Patches", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i7jecn/meds_donation_dotti_patches/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597133333, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/i7nt9q/tuesday_am_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i7nt9q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Daily", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 82, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/i7nt9q/tuesday_am_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597133343, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!
