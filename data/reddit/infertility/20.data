I felt crashed. So, one of my best friends called today to see how Im doing. She is fertile and never had trouble conceiving. She never had a chemical or miscarriage. So I told her I'm feeling incredibly sad over the loss of my pregnancy. And she said \"oh, don't call it that, it wasn't a real pregnancy, it was only a chemical, it's ok\".

The procedure itself was pretty painless, but gearing up for it was not. I started to see my Wondfo OPKs darken on Friday, so I thought I would surge on Saturday. This is now the 3rd month in a row where I see a surge with Wondfos but never end up seeing a peak with my ClearBlue digital OPKs. Frustrating.\n\nOn Friday, I posted a pic to /r/tfablineporn and several users confirmed what I was thinking - it wasn\u2019t a full on surge yet. Made sure hubs and I had \u201cus time\u201d that day since the next day would likely be the surge, which we intended to skip to make sure he had a good sample on the day of IUI. I went out that night and saw Deadpool and had a good time with my husband and another couple we\u2019re friends with.\n\nOn Saturday morning, I woke up and immediately knew I was slowly heading into an emotional downward spiral. I used 4 Wondfos throughout the day and never got a true surge, but I watched it darken and then start to lighten up again by that evening. I called the nurse and asked what to do. She said to go get a ClearBlue from the pharmacy, but I already knew I didn\u2019t see a peak on mine that morning (I somehow failed to mention this to her). Looking at it with the naked eye, I can see that the LH line is there, it\u2019s just not very dark. Spent the whole day in bed wallowing in sadness and watching UnReal. Husband tried to get me to get out of bed and go on some errands with him. Nope.\n\nWoke up to my thermometer on Sunday and temp was a little higher than the previous two days. Used an OPK with SMU and it was faint again. I knew the day before had been my surge. I immediately called the nurse and asked if we could come in for an IUI. The donation drop off should have been at 7:30. I told her we could be there by 8:15. Woke up my husband and made him do his thing (and he surprisingly did without a lot of fuss considering I was waking him up at 7:45 with this news). I ran it down to the lab and came home.\n\nI went back to the clinic at 11:15 with husband in tow. The IUI was pretty boring - a little of the same cramping I felt when I got my HSG mostly just from a tube being inserted into my cervix. Husband managed to not make crass jokes to the RE, and yet, he was still surprised when I undressed from the waist down before beginning\u2026 Like how does he assume this was supposed to happen?! I asked for a form for CD21 bloodwork so we can check my progesterone - one test I haven\u2019t done yet. I also got a form for beta.\n\nOnce we left, I felt the weight lifted. Knowing now how much of a mess I was on Saturday, I am definitely asking for a trigger shot. I\u2019m beyond frustrated with my OPKs still never showing a full on surge. I\u2019ve tried everything my RE has said - try to drink less water, make sure to wait 4 hours between going to the bathroom (seriously torture for me as I pee *a lot*). Try in the evening. Try in the morning. Try try try. Like just give me a fucking trigger shot so I don\u2019t have to deal with all this insanity.\n\n\nLastly, this was my husband\u2019s second SA. Here\u2019s a comparison.\n\n**First SA from August natural values:**\n\nConcentration - 23.5 million/mL\n\nTotal Count - 103.4 million\n\nMotility - 49%\n\nTotal Motile Sperm - 50.67 (no # after - I assume million)\n\nMorphology - 0.5%\n\n**Post Wash Values:**\n\nConcentration - 83.5 million/mL\n\nTotal Count - 41.75 million\n\nMotility - 32.87%\n\nTotal Motile Sperm - 13.72 million\n\nMorphology - 1%\n\n\n**Yesterday:**\n\nConcentration - 8 million/mL\n\nTotal Count - 26.4 million\n\nMotility - 62%\n\nTotal Motile Sperm - 16.4 million\n\nTotal Motile Normal: .82 million\n\nMorphology - 5%\n\nProgression: 2-3\n\n**Post Wash Values:**\n\nConcentration - 38 million/mL\n\nTotal Count - 19.4 million\n\nMotility - 66%\n\nTotal Motile Sperm - 12.8 million (*this value is underlined by my RE*)\n\nTotal Motile Normal: .64 million\n\nMorphology - 5%\n\nProgression: 3\n\nI\u2019m a little hesitant about these values. I\u2019m very happy to see his motility and morphology have both improved. But are they improved only because his concentration and count are way less?? The RE was like \u201cthese numbers are good! let\u2019s do this!\u201d but looking at them today I\u2019m like ehh???\n\nTL;DR - must do trigger for the next IUI as a I basically had a meltdown waiting on my surge. Husband\u2019s SA numbers are simultaneously better and worse?!

Here's how it went today:\n\nWe are done. It all went well. For those who may be interested, we went in at 8am today, after 8 hours of fasting/no water. The gave us ourr hospital gowns, caps, and some booties to keep our feet warm. After getting our I.V.s in, they wheeled me into the surgical room around 9am. I got on the table, got situated in the stirrups, I vaguely remember them washing me  and the next thing I knew, they were waking me to move me back on to the gurney to wheel me out. It was about 9:30. I saw my husband and said I was fine and then they took him for his biopsy. I was kind of drifting in and out and he was done about 20/30mins later. So by 10am we were both side by side on our gurneys recovering. \nWe napped for about an hour, and then we were both  hungry and just ready to get out of there. The heart rate monitor was so loud, it kept waking me up. About 11:30, they took out the IVs, gave us some juice (the most delicious mango juice my parched throat has ever known) and then took us to a different recovery room for us to change and wait for the doc. They also didn't want either of us driving yet. Three episodes of friends later, the doc came in around 2pm and told me they had gotten 15 eggs. For my husband, they took two samples - one for now and one to freeze. Seems like the samples did not have a much sperm but it should be fine for ICSI. He is planning a 3 day transfer for Thursday and we can decide if we want to transfer 2 or 3 embryos, all depending on how things go between now and then, of course.\n\nOverall, not bad. Neither of us seems to have had issues with the anesthesia. They kept asking if we were nauseous and we were both ok. Husband is icing his injury, says it's not bad. I feel overall fine - kind of the same as yesterday - I just feel like my ovaries are swollen and uncomfortable. It's a bit worse when walking, but when sitting down, it's fine. I've had period cramps that were way worse. I had a teeny bit of spotting. \n\nMy one thing I would do next time - bring a book, and some earplugs to block out the damn heart monitor so I could sleep! The worse part of it all was just the waiting around....\n\nOh, and when I got there, the nurse told me to take my wedding rings off. No can do, especially with IVF bloat. She made it sound like it was going to be a big deal and now my finger is sore and swollen from trying to get them off. In the end, the surgeon didn't care about that at all. My advice - if your rings are at all tight, remove them before even starting the IVF cycle. Wish I had!\n\nAnd as a bonus, the gods smiled down upon me today when I got weighed and realized our digtal scales at home is showing weights at about 12lbs higher than they should be. Both my husband and I were wondering how the hell we had gained so much and our clothes still fit. Well, we didn't. Home scales are wrong. Doc's scales had me just 3 lbs higher than when I weighed in last month.

So a few weeks ago I had a repeat HSG to check for a hydrosalpinx after our December loss.  The tubes were all clear but my RE thought the edges of my uterus looked uneven and wanted to look at them more.  Then-because OF COURSE-she went on vacation for like a week and a half so I didn't hear anything else.  Welp, today my clinic calls me and leaves a voicemail saying that she looked at the HSG results again and wants me to come in for a saline sonogram.  Awesome.....so glad to know that I'm part of the 1 percent of people who possibly developed scarring post D&amp;C (my RE actually said it was only 1 percent, which seemed unbelievable to me, but I just nodded and smiled because otherwise I would have started crying or laughing hysterically like a crazy person because IF has driven me that fucking nuts).  Now it's possible that the SIS will be fine, but come on, it's me, so you know the results will be fucked.  I got a normal pap after my September LEEP so I must pay the price for a normal result, right?  I can't possibly get two normal results in a row....that would violate all that is holy and good, angels would fall from the heavens dead as a doornail, and a thousand kittens and puppies would cry out in pain, amirite?  \n\nAnyway, just....really, Universe?

I can't even imagine living like that anymore because there's just always. fucking. something.\n\nOh, and to top it all off with a big ol' shit cherry on top of the shit sundae, I had to go into the office today and my cubicle neighbor had finally returned from her maternity leave.  You can guess at all the wonderful shit I had to listen to.....including an extended conversation about \"finding time for yourself\" after having a baby and all the fun family shit there is to do in my area.  Fuck.  You.  Luckily I had earphones with me but still....I heard enough.  Finding time for yourself is tough, huh?  Tired of being, well, tired?  Seriously, fuck. you.  Boo. Fucking. Hoo.  I would give my right arm to be tired like you are tired and to need \"time to myself.\"  Fuck. You.  Luckily I don't know her well so I wasn't forced to speak with her about it myself; I can't even imagine what I would have said.  Probably something that shouldn't be uttered in polite workplace conversation.  I seriously think my response the next time someone from my work asks me \"so, when are you going to start a family, HK?\" will be \"when my body stops killing them\" and leave it at that.

My wife and I have been TTC for 8 months now. I know its not that long but it feels like forever.  In an effort to make sure everything is OK on my end, I went to my Primary Care Physician last week to get a semen analysis.  My doc called me on Friday morning with the news that my sperm had low motility.  I apologize in advance but I don't have the exact numbers available as I just requested last night that the doctor mail them to me.  As you can expect this news devastated me.  \n\nBefore I go on let me tell you a little about myself.  I don't drink alcohol or use tobacco.  My stress levels are pretty low.  My BMI is 21.8 and I exercise regularly.  My go to exercise is cycling, in which I am probably on the bike between 3-4 hours a week and more in the spring/summer.  I love doing it and it keeps me happy.\n\nMoving on...My doc knew ahead of the results that I'm an avid cyclist.  So when she got the results I know she did a quick \"low sperm motility cycling\" search which produced several links to a study in which she brought up on the call to go over the results. http://road.cc/content/news/28391-five-hours-cycling-week-makes-your-sperm-less-active-says-study  She informed me that this is likely the cause of my motility issue. Just hearing of this news I knew what the doc was suggesting and what was going to be expected of me in order to continue TTC with my wife...give up the bike until pregnant.  \n\nWhile at first I was totally fine with this in order to get my wife pregnant, but the more I thought about it the more I became unsatisfied with the information at hand.  I began researching obsessively for low motility causes.  I came across fertility doctors blogs, more research, and a million things in between.  What I've came away from this knowing is the following:\n\n-The cycling and low motility research is more or less inconclusive and the people in the referenced study were already getting an SA for one reason or another related to infertility.  If anything I should look into getting the fit on my bike looked at for safe measures.\n\n-My doctor should have suggested getting a second SA done due to the unreliability of an SA in general\n\n-Vitamins, take them!!  I started taking a Mens multivitamin which includes Vit C and B12.\n\n-I wear briefs (thin, synthetic, breathable) and skinny jeans and sit in an office chair most of the day.  I probably need to change this more than anything.  Thoughts?\n\nAnyways, I informed my wife last night that I was not satisfied with the docs suggestion, given that it is not her area of specialty.  My wife wasn't happy that I was doubting the doctors suggestion and thought I was just looking for a reason to get back on the bike...we're now fighting.  While part of what my wife thinks may be true, I really just want to get to the root cause of this.  Lets say I give up the bike for 3 month and get another SA and the results are the same.  At this point we'll know its not cycling related due to the ~70 days it takes to make sperm.  I'll then have given up cycling for 3 months for no reason, motility is still low, and we're no closer to pregnancy than we were 3 months ago.  \n\nIn conclusion, I'm not really sure why I'm posting here...maybe to vent, maybe support, advice?  My head hasn't been clear since getting the news and its kept me up the past 2 nights.  As mentioned previously, my wife and I are now fighting over this which is just fantastic on top of everything else.  I know we'll make up eventually but it's not something I need right now.  So that's where I'm at right now and I'm not 100% sure of what our next steps should be.  \n\nEdit:  Link to better article that critiques the research from a fertility specialists perspective.\nhttp://theturekclinic.com/cycling-childlessness-sperm-counts-male-infertility/\nL-Carnitine and COQ10 have been ordered.

Been a lurker for a while and always wanted to partake, but never knew what to contribute to this subreddit as my husband and I are in the beginning stages of the whole process. So, maybe I'll start with venting. As you may notice, humor is my coping mechanism... \n\nToday I have my Femvue scan (very similar to HSG, but in short, with bubbles and saline instead AND it's FREE because they're teaching some of the clinic how to use it I guess. I don't have to pay $2000 for a similar proceedure? Yes please, take my money and let's do this. I'm literally going to ask the group of people if they're \"ready for the big show\" once I'm in those damn stirrups since it will be awkward as fuck with femvue reps and people learning shit). I'm not looking forward to this, cause it's bad enough showing off your vadge to one doc. I'm nervous, because obviously it won't be a walk in the park, but moreso, I'm terrified it will confirm the blockage I've been concerned about for quite sometime. I'm scared shitless that my husband, who is my best friend in the world, will soon decide that this isn't worth it, that he wants someone who can easily give him the family he's always wanted. He can't do this anymore. Tired of the timed/numb sex, all the money spent, the hearbreak.\n\nHis sperm are perfect little swimmers, tons of the little fuckers too..this shit is all on me and it sucks. Our future is on/in my womb, my vagina, my hormones, my body. All me. It's rough, as I'm sure you all already know.\n\nWe've been trying for a year and a half, started at the infertility clinic this December, and after this our next steps are the $500 down payment to start treatments. I may do two cycles after this and if no pregnancy i may take a hiatus already, because this 16 month emotional roller coaster already sucks and I already want off the ride.  I'm very new to this.. and it's lonely as fuck and my mother and best friend are only ones who know and neither know what this is like.  I'm hoping you'll welcome me.

We were riding quite high throughout the process after insurance errors by my employer delayed our start for ~6 months.  The TESE confirmed the presence of sperm, though we were required to have this procedure before IVF was approved so we had to then freeze this sperm.  Wife had 11 eggs retrieved, 8 mature, 6 fertilized.  We had 4 left for a day 5 transfer, and this is where things just went downhill.  The doc performing the transfer seemed incredibly evasive of our questions, gave vague answers that the embryo was \"good\" (it wasn't), and ultimately just seemed a bit foreboding.  But we shook this and hoped for the best.  But by the first follow-up 2 days later we learned that all embryos had arrested, and that we had nothing left to freeze.  And sure enough, 10 days later there's no pregnancy.  Right now we're just left trying to find out when we can begin round two, but our clinic won't even get us a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  This just seems wrong, especially since we had a different doctor at every step and they all seemed rather detached from our care.  To make matters worse, I met with my urologist and he thinks the failure might be due to using frozen sperm.  Well we never wanted to use frozen, but were forced to do so because of our insurance company.   I'm not too excited about the prospect of a 2nd surgery that could have been avoided, but ultimately I'll do anything required for the best odds.  I'm not really sure where I'm going with this post, so I'll just throw out some questions that are on my mind:\n\n - Anyone dealing with male-factor azoospermia with blockage have expertise on success with frozen vs. fresh sperm?  My understanding is that TESE acquired sperm are immature as it is, and putting them through the freeze/thaw cycle just makes them that much more likely to fail.  There's been no talk of other procedures like PESA, etc. and I don't know why they're dismissed by our doc.\n\n - Any success stories about blockage repair on here?  Any words of wisdom for pursuing this line of treatment?\n\n - About how long do you all typically wait between cycles?  We're moving in a couple of months are were really hoping to get in one more cycle at our current clinic, but that may not be possible.  \n\nWe're just really bummed out that we thought we'd have at least one embryo for a FET, but instead we're left right back at the beginning.  I'm sure this is an all-to-common feeling around here.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Thoughts on First Cycle", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/478nas/thoughts_on_first_cycle/"}, {"author": "traipsingalong", "author_created_utc": 1432171075, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "36F - MFI - IVF #1 Feb 2016-fail; IVF#2 Mar2016", "author_fullname": "t2_nldy0", "created_utc": 1456261316, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/478rax/progesterone_suckiness/", "gilded": 0, "id": "478rax", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 22, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/478rax/progesterone_suckiness/", "retrieved_on": 1459210323, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So I had my retrieval of 15 eggs yesterday (FYI-as of today, Day 1, we have 10 fertilized).\nDoc said I could do injections or suppositories for progesterone.\nI chose injections because about 12 years ago I was traumatised by a suppository I was prescribed for a yeast infection.

I am sorry to make such a negative post. My next post will be a positive one for my sake and yours. I wanted to share what happened when I took the advice to take some space from that friend that peed on my pregnancy tests and announced her pregnancy at my party. To keep it simple, I'm going to copy/paste the police statement I had to give today, changing names for privacy.\n\nAfter being accused of causing someone's miscarriage by wishing it, after being called awful names and being told someone hopes I never ever have a child, I am feeling really really down.\n\nThe statement:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBev is someone that I met in high school, though we were never really friends until the summer of 2015 when we connected on Facebook. On Sunday, February 14th, 2016, I had some friends over to my house for my annual \u201ccommercial love day baking\u201d get together. Bev was one of those guests. She had gone to my bathroom, and she used two of my pregnancy tests that were in the cabinet. She called me down to show me, and then showed me photos of her previously taken positive pregnancy tests. I am a woman who has been struggling with infertility for two years and Bev is well aware of this. I did not react negatively in any way towards her that day. When the other guests arrived, Bev went on about her pregnancy throughout the afternoon. For personal reasons, it was difficult for me to digest and after speaking with some women that are experiencing similar infertility struggles, I was advised to take some time and distance myself from Bev for a little while until I was ready. I was responding to her regular conversational text messages in a normal fashion last week until she started asking me about my doctor\u2019s appointments. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to respond, and that\u2019s where I stopped responding to Bev\u2019s messages on my iphone and Facebook.\n\nOn Sunday, February 21st, that\u2019s when the messages from Bev and her boyfriend, Chris, became unfriendly. Bev started messaging John (my husband) on Facebook Messenger asking for a response from me. John did not respond. Chris then phoned John (at 8:45PM), to which John did not answer. At this point, John responded to Bev on Facebook Messenger explaining to her that I was upset due to Bev coming to my house and using two of my pregnancy tests and gloating about her pregnancy all afternoon when she knows that I am struggling with infertility, and that I needed space and wanted to be left alone to process my feelings, and I will contact her when I am ready. This was our first time asking to be left alone. Bev responded with a long message generally stating that she was sorry she hurt me and that looks forward to hearing back from me \u201cwhen she (me) is ready\u2026\"\n\nMonday at 11:56AM, John received a text on his iphone from Chris telling us that we were jealous of Bev\u2019s pregnancy and that I need to talk to Bev because she is extremely upset. \n\nChris also told John that Bev suffers from what is known as Borderline Personality Disorder.\n\nJohn messaged Chris back (at 1:02PM) and asked for them to leave us alone a second time. John blocked Chris on his iphone at this point. Bev messaged John again. John and I blocked Bev and her boyfriend Chris on all social media and iphones. \n\nOn Monday, February 22nd, at 2:30pm, we received an email at our joined address, meandhusband@gmail.com from Bev. She was verbally abusive in telling me how I am a terrible friend who does not care about her and if I do not contact her, she threatened to phone my mother and tell her about the infertility problems that my husband and I had been keeping private. She said that she\u2019s been talking to several of her friends about what a terrible friend I am. She also told me that this was the last time she would contact me. We immediately returned her Medela breast pump machine that she had asked for in her email. After we returned the machine, I emailed Bev at 4:27PM, expressing my feelings that I wanted space and would have contacted her when I was ready, but after her threats to go to my family, I cannot come back from that nastiness. \n\nBev emailed me again at 5:05pm expressing her distraught state and using a few insults, end with \u201chave a good one, wish you the best\". We did not respond. \n\nBev emailed again at 5:27pm expressing more distraught emotions, ending her email with \u201cI\u2019m just going to let you heal and try to forget as well.\u201d We did not respond.\n\nBev emailed again at 5:38pm with screenshots of her text conversations with her friends discussing my intimate personal life (my infertility journey). We did not respond.\n\nBev emailed me this morning, February 23rd, at 6:57am, telling me that she is having a miscarriage so now I don\u2019t have to feel bad for not having a baby. Bev included pictures of blood and blood clots on tissue paper. We did not respond.\n\nBev emailed me at 6:58am. We did not respond.\n\nBev emailed me at 8:53am saying, \u201cJust really wish I had you to talk to right now.\" We did not respond. \n\nBev emailed me at 10:40am saying, \"Wow!!! I'm nasty?!?!!!! You are a major insensitive bitch!!! I just had a miscarriage and you can't say anything to me? I hope you never have fucking kids you little fucking bitch. I'm calling your mother you fucking little whore!!!\u201d We did not respond. \n\nBev emailed me at 10:42am saying, \"You must be sitting on your Little happy horse wishing everyone kids death. I can't believe you!!! You two I wish I never met\u201d. We did not respond. \n\nBev then phoned my mother while she was at work and told her about how I have been struggling with infertility and I am trying to have a baby (which my mother did not know yet) and how I cut Bev out of my life when she needed a friend during her miscarriage. \n\nI spoke with my mother at 3:30pm to clear the air and explain that Bev may not be in her right mind so please be careful.\n\nBecause this situation escalated so quickly and Bev\u2019s actions were becoming more and more destructive of my personal life and well being, I decided to seek help from the authorities. I went to the Police office, and phoned the non-emergency number I was given at 4:40pm.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe police said that they paid \"Bev\" a visit and explained to her to leave me alone. If she comes near me or my house or messages me again, I can phone the police and they will come within minutes, and they will help me file a permanent restraining order. If she breaches a restraining order, she goes straight to jail. \n\nI am feeling so so so gross inside. I am so glad my husband is here with cheesecake and my dog is glued to my side. It's almost like my dog knows something's up... he has been so calm and mellow and staying out of the way and not leaving my side for a second. Hopefully this is my last post on the matter, and I can focus on positivity in my life and post positive things in this forum!

They make my heart happy)\n\nI had to take an unexpected 3 week hiatus, mostly because of work. I had a big project I needed to send off to print. I thought the work was due in April, turns out it was MARCH! Ahhh! So, I cut the social and Reddit cords to hunker down, work some 15-hour days and get shit done. Which I did. Sent that mother off to print yesterday. Felt real good y'all, real good. \n\nIn my absence I turned 33 and the husband turned 38. I re-did CD3 blood work, and we did genetic carrier screening. My new RE, Dr. Awesomesauce was concerned I was a Fragile X carrier because my reserve is so low. Let's talk about that...\n\nI had my first CD3 labs in July of 2015, see the numbers below compared with my new lab results from January 2016:\n\nFSH: 9.6--&gt;10.2\n\n**AMH: 0.99--&gt;0.5**\n\nEstradiol: 71--&gt;65\n\n\nGood news is I am not a Fragile X carrier, neither me nor my husband are carriers for anything they tested for. Sadly, that's where the good news ends. \n\nWhen my AMH came back so low, Dr. Awesomesauce sent us for the genetic testing. His thought was Fragile X would explain my rapidly declining reserve. But, nope. I *did* have a lap to remove an endometrioma on my right ovary back in October. Any ovarian surgery will reduce reserve. Period. But, he thinks the drop in AMH cannot be entirely explained by the lap. So, we're dealing with unexplained premature diminished ovarian reserve. We all know the next place for me is strait-up premature ovarian failure. Fortunately, I'm still ovulating on my own and I'm very regular. Our RE is cautiously optimistic. \n\nThe plan? He recommends one injectable IUI cycle. That's right just one before moving on to IVF. He said we're not going to waste any more time with Clomid TI or IUIs. Whew, *fuck that drug y'all.* He said we've got about a 25% chance with injectable IUI, and if it fails, then we will have much information gathered to apply to an IVF protocol. Right now, before knowing how/if I'll respond to the injectable gonadotropins, he gives IVF a 35-37% chance of success, but he was clear to say that percentage will go up or down depending how my response to the injectable IUI. Also, since there's clearly something going on with my eggs, he recommends PGS testing any embryos we might get. Of course, if we get embryos to test, and they come back chromosomally normal, that ups our chances of an FET success to 70%. But, there are a lot of \"if's\" getting there. \n\n\nReal talk: \n\nI'm down for the injectable IUI. I'm CD14 now and should have my baseline in 12-14 days. Husband is all about giving me the injections too :). I'm not excited about the progesterone; he said they use jelly, not suppositories or injections. But, why should you gals have all the fun? I have a fear that the IUI will work and we'll have the most amazing baby ever and then, when we want another, my reserve will be so low that IVF won't even be an option then. The RE said that was a valid fear, since they don't know why my supply is so quickly dropping, and my endo will likely be back by then. \n\nHonestly though, I'm not sure if I'll do IVF. I think seeing my response to the gonadotropins will help us decide, but if our chances stay below 50%, I'll probably bow out of this race. Sad to think about that. I know I've announced on this sub that I'd decided I'm willing to do IVF (long time IVF fence sitter here), and I am, but now that we have this new information, well, it might not be worth 20k+. We would need the most expensive microflare protocol, then probably more drugs, then PGS, then ICSI required for PGS...for possibly less than 40% chance of success? I'm not sure I could handle that kind of failure. The stakes would be so high, and the fall would be so low. Also, I can't spend the rest of my *youth* in treatment. I can't compartmentalize this. I'm all in or all out. It's so hard to live life fully while still trying to have a baby. I don't know how so many of you do it. \n\nMore so, husband and I have been fighting a lot lately because I can't process my emotions in a healthy way and he doesn't have a lot of patience for depression. He says baby or no baby he wants us to to be happy again. I'm fearful he wants a baby more than he's letting on, but those are his emotions; I can't assume anything more than he tells me. For me, baby = happy, no treatment = happy; treatment = not happy.\n\nIf you made it to the end of this long-ass post, you deserve a prize! [here it is](http://i.imgur.com/vacT4nK.jpg)!

I would come home, immediately change into PJs, and lay on the couch and let my husband serve me.  I highly recommend that last part.  I have a very sedentary job, so if your job is active, I would highly recommend 3-5 days off work.\n\nI attempted to stop taking my prescription pain meds 2 days after surgery.  That was a mistake. I wasn't in intense pain so I felt like I didn't need it, but the low grade pain would grind on me until I felt depressed.  Then I would take a pain pill, pain would go away along with the depression.  I ended up taking 2-3 pills (Norco 5) per day until a week after the surgery and then no longer needed it.  Getting out of bed in the morning was painful for about 9-10 days.  The area under the incision felt like a burn, not a cut, very odd sensation.  I continued to have muscle soreness (felt like a pulled muscle) for about 3 weeks, but nothing terrible.  I was able to sneeze without pain about 2.5 weeks after the surgery.  My bladder mildly hurt/ached to pee for about 3 weeks.  It felt like I was getting a UTI but without the pain in the urethra.  \n\nI bled and spotted for about a week and I had super gentle sex 9 days after the surgery and normal sex 2 weeks after without issue.\n\nI got my period 2 days late.

The other two incisions are just at the line of my pubic hair so I think once the hair grows back, the scars will be hidden entirely.\n\nI underestimated what this surgery would be like.  I read about it and saw it called 'bandaid surgery' (because the incisions are so small they put bandaids over the incisions) and thought 'eh, no big deal!'.  Therefore I did not schedule any time off or continue taking pain medications for a reasonable length of time (at first).  Yes, the incisions are tiny but the RE still took a burning laser to my insides, bashed around my ovaries, scrambled my endometrial lining, and poked holes through my abdomen.

(I'm on Cycle day 1, for anyone who was wondering - we had lots of sex, but I ovulated late, so we missed it). I feel like I know my body, but they won't listen. For example, I didn't get any positive OPKs with the Femara and 4 eggs and I was past cycle day 20. I know me, with the PCOS and even on Femara I sometimes am a late ovulator. I called and asked for a CD 21 blood test to confirm ovulation. All they said was \"oh you'll definitely ovulate around day 14 or 15. Well guess what, it was definitely a week after they said based on when I got my period....Also, I'm paying for it, just do it?

They're doing tests and bloodwork and all kinds of stuff that after being a patient of Penn for so long, they never even did - they've KNOWN about my issues for years and never had me do an HSG test? They didn't think it was needed....well, my HSG is this coming Friday. The doctor couldn't believe with my mom and sister having severe endo that I was never checked for blocked tubes.\n\nThe best part was, he told me and my husband it's his absolute goal to get us pregnant on the first attempt. Maybe some people wouldn't like that bold approach, but I'll tell you I loved it. He gave me more faith than Penn ever did.\n\nI was really nervous to make the switch, but I do feel like I'm in great hands.

(And I\u2019m ovulating while I\u2019m here\u2026uggggh.) ANYway, I just got back from a get-together with two girlfriends, my mom, and one of their moms. \n\nLet\u2019s give people fake names:\n\nSonja \u2013 one teenage son, one MC. Her mom, Danielle \u2013 two adult kids including Sonja.\n\nMaggie \u2013 two young sons, including one she conceived the month she started trying. Maggie is a doting mother, but her useless in-laws cannot stop popping out babies that get ignored or exploited.\n\nAnd my mom. My parents have no idea Mr. CCC is dealing with MFI because they have a long history of panicking the fuck out for months, obsessing over ridiculous \u201csolutions,\u201d and broadcasting it to family across several continents when anything goes even slightly wrong with me. If we ever want a moment\u2019s peace again, we will never tell them about the MFI.\n\nMaggie brought one of her little sons to this get-together at the last-second because Mr. Maggie cannot watch both kids as he is helping paint his parents\u2019 home, where all the baby-popping siblings live and suddenly baby #7 (seven) on the way apparently means that the house needs fresh paint.\n\nSonja and Danielle pumped me for information on what\u2019s happening, now that we\u2019re almost at Year 6 of trying without even a scare. After getting grilled about fertility testing, I broke enough to say that we\u2019re under a doctor\u2019s care but \u201ceverything that should be there is there.\u201d (Gray lie \u2013 his SA has all the numbers. Just not high numbers.) \n\nI also had to explain:\n\n- IVF is expensive and does not always work.\n\n- Adoption is also expensive and does not always work. \n\n- Adoption does not 100% of the time magically trigger \u201ca baby right afterward.\u201d\n\n- We have been in life crisis mode almost the entire time we have been trying. \u201cJust relax\u201d will never apply to us unless people stop dying, or our industries stop having layoffs, or landlords stop stalking us, or parents stop going into the hospital, or etc. etc. etc.\n\n\nI also got a \u201cwell maybe you are not meant to have kids\u201d from Danielle. While Maggie sat there frowning as we had just discussed the seven babies and the paint job.\n\nIn the middle of all this, I snuck a glance at my mom. She was staring at the ground, arms and feet crossed. My heart imploded. Mom is a \u201cchild whisperer\u201d and was born to be a grandmother. She has never, once, said a word to me about wanting grandkids, but she does not have to. She echoed feebly the \u201cmaybe it is not meant to be\u201d sentence, without looking at me. \n\nI\u2019m back at my parents' house now, numb and tired. I\u2019m going to dinner with another friend (single and child-free) shortly. I\u2019m too exhausted to drink, but if I were home, I\u2019d be whipping up a cocktail right quick.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A lovely afternoon of Infertility Bingo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/47zphy/a_lovely_afternoon_of_infertility_bingo/"}, {"author": "sarah_harvey", "author_created_utc": 1406506869, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_hlo5x", "created_utc": 1456627529, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/47zs8f/choosing_iui_without_any_mfi_when_and_how_did/", "gilded": 0, "id": "47zs8f", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 19, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/47zs8f/choosing_iui_without_any_mfi_when_and_how_did/", "retrieved_on": 1459223155, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So it's cd1 and I'm feeling pretty low.

I learn I am last in the queue, at 5pm I go in, I am walked through to the theatre, the room is a hive of activity, the two doctors, a few nurses, all being lovely and calm, I voice my concern about not being put under before so a nurse holds my hand as I drift off, which in itself was bizarre,  I like to be in control, this was definitely out of my comfort zone!\n\nSo the next thing I am aware of is waking up in a bed, in what I believed to be the recovery area of the day surgery unit, the clock on the wall in front of me says 3oclock, but didn't I go in at 5pm? My mind is groggy and I can't seem to figure it out, it was like I had all the answers but I couldn't put everything together in the right order, the blinds were closed and for a day surgery unit it was awfully quiet. \n\nI then realize I really need to pee, I have an IV in attached to a bag on wheels, I then go to sit forward, it felt like my insides were burning and tearing, it hurt like hell! with the help of a nurse I eventually get out of bed and shuffle across the room, time disappears, I am offered a few different types of painkillers and over next few hours, I just rinse and repeat the above scenario.\n\nEventually at about 12pm, I get to go home. It's then, after the drugs wear off that I learn exactly what happened and how out of it I actually was, Once they opened me up they realized that the situation was quite bad, four incisions in total were made, I had adhesions everywhere, things were stuck fast to one another and that both my tubes were blocked, the doctor had tried to do her best to free up as much as possible, she tried to fire dye through both my tubes with no luck, things then backfired for me and I ended up becoming a human colander, a hole was punched through the wall of my uterus with the end of a catheter,  I have been told they can't tell me if it will cause issues if I was to get pregnant, due to the area in which it happened, they have no numbers. I'm hopeful, it's a wall of muscle, how bad can it be!?\n\nI was in surgery for just over 2 hours, I don't remember anything, at about 7.15pm I was wheeled out of surgery and into recovery in the day unit, I was the last one there, apparently at some point a nurse put an oxygen mask on my face, and were stood around talking about how I had been in there for 2 hours, according to my husband I pulled off the mask, sat upright in bed and shouted quite loudly \"2 hours is a bloody long time!\" the nurse laughed and said they would let me have that one as I was so out of it! \n\nAt 9pm they decided to keep me knocked out, they wheeled me in a bed out of the day surgery unit, locking the door and saying goodbye to a couple of the nurses who went home, we went across the road and through a carpark into  the main building, the room I woke up in was at the other end of the main building, where I had my own bathroom and bedroom to myself.\n\nI ended up having 10 weeks off work as I had quite a physical job at the time and required help just getting both up and down from the sofa, I slept sitting up in bed for a while, the scars are still apparent, occasionally even pain in the general area,  it was a deeply unpleasant experience as I like to be able to do things for myself, asking for help is not something I can do easily. \n\nI consider us very lucky as we live in the UK and have two rounds of IVF on the NHS.\n\nMy little sister is now pregnant with her second and will again manage a spring birth in a couple of months after moving into her dream house in her dream location.  I'm not bitter, not bitter at all! I really do not like the person this is turning me into, I am pleased for her but managing my feelings is becoming a full time job. \nI am very close to starting our 1st IVF journey, have had planning, just waiting on the app to teach me how to inject in the next week, I'm dealing with it the only way I know how, head and down push on through to the other side, it's going to be bumpy ride. \n\nIf you managed to get this far, thank you for reading!

I'm new around here and just figuring things out. I'd love some perspective right about now and some direction as I plan my next steps! Some backstory: I'm 27. Went off BC July of last year, pregnant in August, miscarried at 7 weeks and super irregular periods since then! I've only had 4 cycles since my miscarriage and they were 47 days, 37 days, 67, and 43 days. No positive tests. I went to my OBGYN with my chief complaint being irregular bleeding but she didn't seem to CARE AT ALL. Just said that things could go back to normal at any time and to come back in July if I'm not pregnant. She did do FSH, prolactin and TSH labs (just in case) and said it was all normal. What are my next steps? Can I skip the year long wait due to irregular cycle lengths? Should I switch providers? I know I'm only 27 but I've been married for 5 years and I'm finally out of school and have a great job with great insurance. \nThanks! Looking forward to hearing what you guys have to say.
