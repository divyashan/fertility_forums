During this appointment I enquired if I should have my husbands SA done again as it has almost been 10 years. She told me not to worry men's sperm won't decline and sends me off with the clomid. \n\nMonth after month my blood tests were showing I was ovulating yet still nothing. Me and the hubby decided to order our own SA with his GP. Turns out his numbers and motility are both low so month after month I had all these drugs making me feel like shit for nothing.\n\nWe are now seeing a RE who has told us we would probably be best to go straight to IVF..

WALL OF TEXT.\n\nJust reporting back after going to the RE appointment. It started off pretty bad, when I showed up a couple minutes late because I severely underestimated Friday morning traffic. (I have to travel an hour.)\n\nThe receptionist started giving me lip for my husband not being there. I basically said something along the lines of \"my husband is shooting artillery in field training for the next war,  but he'd do anything to be here. if you have a problem with that, I suggest you take it up with the Marine Corps.\" \n\nThat shut her up REAL quick. \n\nThe resident to my RE began taking vitals and health histories. She was trying to maintain bedside manner but I could tell me being young and alone was abnormal for her. \n\nRE came in,  I handed her my charts and labs. She agreed I am anovulatory and my PCOS. She ordered a whole slew of tests and a semen analysis. \n\nThe labs were pretty standard: AMH, Estradiol, HCG, Hemoglobin, Hepatitis &amp; HIV, Lipids, Rubella, RPR, TSH, varicella, and an entire genetic testing panel. Since Troy and I are both adopted, we have very limited health histories, and what we do know we want to rule out. (Polycystic kidney disease for one!) turned out to be SEVENTEEN vials of blood taken for labs on the first appointment. \n\nMonday morning I have an HSG, and was told to take 800mg Motrin an hour prior. \n\nShe said I am obese and need to lose at least 10% of my body weight, and ideally 30lbs. I'm 5'4 and roughly 175...but I have a lot of muscle from years and years of Irish Dance. Still I agree, ~10 pounds could really help. Goal weight is 145. Especially since previously I was 0.01 away from being insulin resistant. She hopes the new labs will be more clear one way or another. \n\nThe husband should hopefully maybe be home Monday, or Tuesday, probably Wednesday. Sometime this week for sure! :) \n\nThe lab they are sending him to for the SA ***doesnt*** bill insurance whatsoever, and requires payment in full first. Is that normal\u00bf? For us it's about ~$1400 upfront, and once we get the itemized receipt can personally put in to be reimbursed by insurance after. And while we could put it on our credit cards.. I really don't want to mess with TriCare reimbursements... It could take awhile and I don't want to mess with our emergency funds for something that's frankly not an emergency.  Thinking I'll ask the nurse to submit the referral to the Naval hospital here in the town we live in. They do the SAs in house on base, and therefore also bill TriCare right away. \n\nIf anyone can think of anything else I should ask when I go back Monday, let me know! She wants all the labs back before we decide on a treatment path.

My neighbor/cousin/sister/etc got pregnant right after 3 sessions!\n\n4. Just stop all of your fertility treatments - it's not God's way. All those drugs are unsafe and not proven to work. \n\n5. Instead, try this concoction that had ground up deer antlers and dried bone marrow, that'll spruce you right up. \n\n6. Maybe it's because you should lose 40lbs...\n\n7.

So, I didn't even know they were drawing for this, and because of this one small thing, I'm delayed another 4 weeks, because they have to retest me.

It should have been handled 3 weeks ago on intake if it was so important to them.

I could be choosing my embryos this week and getting my drug protocol.\n\nUPDATE:  I looked back through my first doctor's (not my other clinic that I'm on the wait list with... a clinic that I left because the doctor sucked) records.  They never ordered the Rubella test but checked it off on their little handwritten sheet.  This could have been avoided in January.  The new clinic also could have checked this off 3 weeks ago and let me know it was an issue.  So this is both of their faults for not being on top of their paperwork.

I started typing up a quick catch up in the daily post, but it started getting long so I figured I'd give it its own post.\n\nI'm in the first part of my 4th Clomid + Lovenox + IUI cycle and feeling really meh about everything. It just seems like this is what we have to do before we do IVF. Though, I'm pretty terrified that we're at the brink of IVF territory now. Mostly I'm afraid of PIO. Hearing about the ladies that give themselves the shot gives me hope. I can (and do) inject myself, but PIO just sounds scary and daunting. Assuming this cycle ends as the rest have, we have an appointment with the RE late next month to discuss next steps. On the plus side, I guess that'd mean another month off. \n\nWe took July off from any treatments and it was so refreshing. This is our second cycle back at it. I'm getting less and less optimistic. Early on, it seemed obvious that I'd get pregnant and have a child eventually, even if it took longer than we'd hoped. Now it doesn't feel so certain. \n\nI think what got me here today is realizing that I need the support again. The Clomid is doing a number on my moods this time around. On top of that, my BIL and his wife are expecting in October and I'm supposed to be helping to throw them a shower next month. My husband and I have talked about getting them an extravagant gift (by my standards) because that's what his family does, and he's excited for his brother. Meanwhile, our finances are still recovering from my husband being without work for a few months and finishing off our attic earlier this year. I don't even really like my BIL and his wife. I had a bit of a breakdown earlier after I sent out a group text asking for ideas for a gift that may be pricier than they were willing to register for and telling them how excited I was for them. \n\nSo... hi again!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Catching up", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/50i2n0/catching_up/"}, {"author": "ttctoss", "author_created_utc": 1447121101, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "31 TTC#1 unexplained, trying since Jun '15", "author_fullname": "t2_rw6qj", "created_utc": 1472662200, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/50i6dm/shots_phobias/", "gilded": 0, "id": "50i6dm", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 23, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/50i6dm/shots_phobias/", "retrieved_on": 1473097260, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So, yeah, big needlephobe here, and day 4 of stims was an extra rough one last night.

Here's my story and how it has been successfully treated.\n\nMr. Lemons and I got pregnant but around 10.5 weeks I expelled a bunch grainy black/brown stuff and at an U/S there was no heartbeat.  The doctor gave me the option of miscarrying naturally, scheduling a D&amp;C, or taking medication to induce abortion.  At that time I believed in my body's ability to do what's right and I opted for a natural miscarriage.  A few days later I started bleeding.  I passed clots as big as my hand but I just kept bleeding and laboring for 3 days. I was bleeding a lot.  My midwife asked me to go to the ER. \n\nThis is where it gets intense.  Feel free to skip to the next paragraph.  The ER staff was great.  Unfortunately all of the operating rooms were full so they asked if they could do a vaginal aspiration in the emergency room instead of a full D&amp;C in the OR. The doctor assured me I would be totally unconscious, so I said okay.  They placed the IV and several doctors positioned themselves around my pelvis and an anesthesiologist was controlling the IV. They pushed the propofol, which made my hand feel like it was melting, and the doctors immediately started doing something. But I wasn't unconscious. I started screaming and begging them to stop.  The anesthesiologist pushed more propofol, more hand melting, the doctors started again, more screaming. I was half out of my head, asking Mr. Lemons (who was there, poor man) to tell me a story. The doctors assured him I wouldn't remember any of this. Finally after several rounds, they managed to get me under and I woke up on my side, sobbing.  The nurse who came in to check on me seemed genuinely shocked I remembered any of the procedure. I was discharged. \n\nI did get a follow up with one of the doctors who preformed the vaginal aspiration and she said what happened to me wasn't supposed to happen and apologized.  It really helped to hear that.\n\nSo for weeks/several months after this happened I started having weird flashes. I'd have a flash of thought that there was a sniper with his gun trained on my heart.  Or that a loved one was being burned alive.  Just a quick flash of thought, then gone.  I'd feel like a malevolent spirit was wishing me harm, that perhaps a ghost had taken residence in my home and while it couldn't physically hurt me, the force of his hate radiated. My most common flash was that my dog would burn alive in her cage in a house fire. I stopped ever putting her in her cage even though she would have accidents in the house. I also had some depression but I think it was part trauma and part postpartum depression.  \n\nIt took months for me to realize these symptoms were PTSD, which is especially funny because I work in mental health. For some reason I normalized this, using the ghost explanation or wondering if I were psychic. Brains are weird. \n\nI got therapy.  First talk therapy, which was okay, but then EMDR, which was what really helped.  EMDR is weird but it works.  You first learn relaxation skills, then you revisit the trauma- slowly with the relaxation skills, and then you use eye movements and follow the therapists hand to increase relaxation. It helped my nervous system calm down. \n\nI am 98% recovered. I still won't put my dog in a cage but those flashes are entirely gone and I can talk about the trauma without melting down.  \n\nThis infertility shit is traumatizing. We undergo painful and scary stuff and sometimes that shit even goes wrong and there are complications. Please don't hesitate to seek treatment.

She easily conceived three kids and has no idea what this feels like. In the last 3 years I moved 5 hours away, got married, started TTC, changed careers and had an ectopic. I've been focused on my own life and not doing a long drive every month for some kid-oriented family event. A few months ago she sent me a message berating me for not paying enough attention to her baby and then unfriended me on FB. She was suspicious of our fertility struggles then, but now she knows for sure and according to my other sister, she still thinks my behaviour is wrong. This came up today because my younger sister is coming to visit this weekend and leaving her toddler at home out of sensitivity and my older sister made comments to her that it's wrong I wouldn't want to be around him right now. Our plan is to go to a thermal spa and chill out, pretty sure a three year old cannot do that.\n\nAnyway, I'm furious at her and I don't see how we can ever reconcile our relationship given how insensitive she's been during this horrible time. Also, I would avoid her if I do get pregnant since she doesn't vaccinate her kids (and they hang out with other anti-vaxxers) and I'm not willing risk exposing myself while pregnant or a baby to vaccine preventable illnesses.\n\nDo you think there is any point in writing her a letter explaining my feelings?

I'm unexplained I guess, we thought it was just that I'm anovulatory but even when we got me ovulating we had no success. there is a part of me that's afraid I'm jumping the gun or giving up to soon, even though I know that's not true. 2 years of trying, a blocked tube and then procedure to clear it, letrozole cycles, benched for cysts, 3 months on the pill and the last four months of letrozole and trigger. I don't want to just keep doing meds with no results. I don't want to keep feeling like I am wasting time delaying the inevitable. \n\nI feel guilty that my eating disorder through my teenage/developing years fucked up my fertility. I can't know this for sure but I also can't know it isn't true.\n\nAnd honestly you guys, I'm just scared as fuck. I am afraid of stims, of shots, of OHSS, of not getting any eggs, of not having any fertilize. I just want someone to tell me I'm strong enough because I really don't feel it right now. \n\n**Edited to add: Thank you all so much for the love.

Thank you to all of you who sent well wishes for my recovery. Reading messages from women who have been through this hell helped give me strength to get through the surgery. It's been a difficult time but I've mostly been coping ok. This week is my first fertile period since and I'm not sure if hormones are making me feel more emotional about it all.\n\nI don't really want to call them \"highlights\" but here's a point form version of what went down:\n\n-My hCG only got to 164 but they saw a mass in my left tube and some blood in my pelvis on the ultrasound at 6w1d.\n\n-My ultrasound and surgery were assisted by a fellow who was probably 6-7 months pregnant\n\n-I went for my ultrasound at 1:30 p.m. and was being brought into the ER at 7 p.m. It all happened super fast. I received compassionate and quick care and was grateful for that and our universal healthcare.\n\n-I was dehydrated that day so it took a dozen attempts to get the IV in. They eventually gave me laughing gas to make the process easier and when it kicked in I thought I was going to OD. The machines sounded like they were beeping \u201cTainted Love\u201d.\n\n-In surgery they found a 2.5 cm mass in my left tube and removed it along with the tube. My right tube looked fine and they didn't see any endo (something my RE thought I might eventually want to check for via diagnostic lap)\n\n-I had to stay overnight in the maternity ward sharing a room with a snoring pregnant lady on bedrest and did not sleep at all. My husband had to wear a name tag that said maternity and I of course got wheeled out of the ward with no baby.\n\n-I was so bloated after the surgery I looked 4-5 months pregnant for more than a week and it was a painful reminder\n\n-My RE doesn't recommend another IUI because of the prospect of success, cost, and risk for another ectopic\n\n-We're going to casually try on our own (no OPKs) until we get called off the waitlist for a funded IVF cycle. Estimates for this are sometime between November and March, although January seems most likely.\n\n-The surgery led us to coming out of the infertility closet to our families and I have mixed feelings about that.\n\n-In the days after I stumbled across ridiculous personhood stuff online relating to ectopic pregnancies and it makes me angry some people think I should have risked my life when there was no chance of a viable pregnancy.\n\n-The one baby/pregnancy thing I bought during the less than a week period I thought I might have a viable pregnancy was some \u201cbelly jelly\u201d for stretch marks. I'm now using it on my surgery scars.\n\nEmotionally I've struggled with thinking about whether I could've had the ectopic diagnosed sooner and saved my tube. I was only six weeks along with a low hCG so surgery seemed extreme. I've also dwelled a lot on why this happened as I had a clear SHG a few months before and no risk factors for an ectopic. The other thing that's been hard is thinking it may have been a viable embryo just in the wrong spot. I'm trying to focus now on the fact that we have good shot at success with IVF and seeing a psychologist as needed.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.

The husband and I decided after 4 years of marriage, and 11 years of taking the pill, it was time to stop. We started casually TTC in April 2013. After one year with no luck, I started using OPK's to improve our chances. That caused some stress on the marriage with the not so sexy having intercourse on a schedule situation. We stopped doing that and at about 15 months without conceiving, finally went to see the OB/GYN. All my lab tests were normal, his S/A was normal, there should have been \"no problem\" which is what the doc said. I was offered an HSG at the time but avoided the test out of fear and because all the normal lab tests made it seem unnecessary. Now after 3 years and 5 months of not getting pregnant, I finally did the HSG. I had some anxiety but the insertion of the catheter was easy, the blowing up of the balloon caused some brief intense cramping but bearable. Waiting for the radiologist to come in took what felt like forever. And finally, we were ready. I was able to watch the screen just long enough to see the first small amount of dye enter my uterus, and then the pain took over. I couldn't help but close my eyes and yell \"Ow, ow, ow!\" for the next few minutes, my husband rushed over to hold my hand, but I couldn't stop saying ow. I told the doc I wanted it to be over. He said all the dye was in and they were just taking pictures, I had never been so grateful to hear that. And when he said he was taking the catheter out I said okay and then started bawling. I felt terrible and emotional. With tears in my eyes, the doc showed me the pictures and said, look it's all normal and you never have to do this test again. I think I cried more then over pure relief. So here I am a day later, still emotional and can't stop wondering why? and what now? It's such a helpless feeling.

This was after a good friend of mine got pregnant. I had titled this Motherhood. \n\nRight now i am drowning and i just NEED to finally let it all out. As the tittle mentions, this is all about motherhood. You see we all had a dream as a child, a very important one. Some us forget that dream and move on to new, better ones as we age. Others somehow make their first dream a reality and i admire them for it. My dream was not about a career but it was most certainly about my future, and when i thought about my future i did see myself with a career, or at least a very stable job. I saw a house, not a big one a very small, cozy house, i saw a car (although that one particularly dream didn\u2019t show up until i moved to the U.S because in my country most people do not own a car) I saw pets. However all of those things were always secondary dreams, you see my biggest most desired dream since i was a little girl was to be a mother. I know it sounds crazy for some of you, but for me that was my biggest wish, to have children. Over the years my career dream has change (nowadays is nonexistent) but the one constant for me was always motherhood. I wanted 2 children, a boy and a girl, since the age of, i don\u2019t know 8 i think. I have always had 2 chosen names for my future children. The names changed often but no matter what i always had 2 names picked out. The current ones are Nathan Vladimir for my little boy and Izbeth for my little girl.\n\nAs children we also had fears, again some people outgrow their fears, but mine. oh mine stuck. You see my biggest fear went hand in hand with my biggest dream. Infertility. I was always so scared of it. i would even pray that it would not happen to me (back when i was religious), because all i ever wanted was to have my own children. My dream was to have my children no later than 25 years old, i am now 26 and have 0 children. You see, my biggest fear came true. I am not infertile, no, but i do need to get treatment if i ever want to have a chance of getting pregnant. Not only that but there is a 80% chance that my husband also has a problem, it seems to run on his family. So i am 26 years old, no career, no job, no house and i am falling apart because i am 26 years old and i also have no children.\n\nMy friends have had no problem having adorable babies, and every time one of them ends up pregnant i always get the same questions/comments \u201cwhen are you having one?\u201d \u201cnow it\u2019s your turn\u201d \u201comg please have one so they can play together\u201d i smile and remind them that for me to even be able to get pregnant i would need to go into treatment, they gasp and say \u201cwell why don\u2019t you then\u201d as if it\u2019s as easy as counting 1 2 3, as if it were free, as if it was MY FAULT. I am tired. i hear the same questions, nonstop, from family and friends and people who don\u2019t even know me, and when i mention my problem it\u2019s always either \u201cGod can make anything happen you\u2019ll see\u201d or \u201cyou should really get treatment then\u201d. I am tired because my husband of almost 5 years now and I are struggling, with everything. Wanting to fix his immigrant situation, wanting to find a better job for myself, wanting to go back to school but not being able to because all of that takes money, and they dare ask me why i haven\u2019t gotten myself in treatment.\n\nAs if I didn\u2019t care, as if i didn\u2019t want to. \u201cAre you on birth control, those things are bad for you you know\u201d they say. I am indeed on birth control, but not because i am avoiding pregnancy, for 4 years my husband and I used no birth control at all and i am still without a baby. I am now on birth control because my condition makes my hormones go crazy, and i end up bleeding for months. I almost became anemic because of it, that is why i am on birth control. Not that it matters, i still wouldn\u2019t get pregnant if i wasn\u2019t on them. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want kids?\u201d I DO DAMMIT. That is all i have ever wanted, i have seen my friends and ex-classmates all become parents, i have seen marriages that are falling apart with children, i have seen cheating husbands leaving their wives and kids for others, i have seen my friend get pregnant after only knowing the guy for 6 months. I judge, and i know it\u2019s wrong, and i know i shouldn\u2019t oh but i do. I judge them all and think they are all so damn awful sh*tty people, yet they still manage to have kids. SO WHY NOT ME? WHY NOT US?\n\nI\u2019ve been crying a lot lately, i\u2019ve been feeling sadder than before. I\u2019ve been wanting to disappear, not die no, just vanish from here, from everyone. I have also been telling myself that maybe not having kids is best for me, for us. We could travel, i have always wanted to travel, we have always wanted to go to Japan, we couldn\u2019t do all that with a baby right? Truth is, I am lying to myself. It\u2019s my way of training myself for the fact that i might never have children, because even though i could with treatment, i don\u2019t know if my husband can. I know what you are thinking, i am too young to be thinking about that, because i am not even 30 yet, but in our culture being a mom by 20 is the norm, if you are like me 26 and still no children then it means you will probably never have one. The comments are the worse, the ones i have mentioned before. From people i love and care for, they don\u2019t understand and at first their comments would anger me, but now they only hurt. I have thought of adoption yes, but that takes years and a lot of money I also would feel so guilty taking in a child only because i was unable to have my own.\n\nIt is not my fault that i need treatment. It is not my fault that i don\u2019t have the money for said treatment, and that i probably won\u2019t have it for a long time. It is not my fault that you were able to get pregnant before me. It is not my fault that i cry myself to sleep every night because all my dreams are gone and the one i had been holding onto, the most important one, is also falling apart. It is not my fault that my mother was not as supportive as yours and that now you have it all figured out while i crumble to pieces. It is not my fault that i need birth control pills to keep my condition at bay. It is not my fault that i have yet to experience the feeling of that little being growing inside of you. It is not my fault that my heart breaks thinking i will never experience that amazing, wonderful feeling.

So we opted to miscarry naturally because if this were to happen again multiple D&amp;Cs could cause scarring (BIG HA! Inserted here) The miscarriage process was a nightmare-I was losing too much blood because we later found out our little peanut got stuck coming out- so I ended up needing a D&amp;C after all. Fast forward 9 months (actually it was extremely long and agonizing) waiting in the dark with no period and we finally headed to the RE to get diagnosed with Asherman's Syndrome. My one failed pregnancy left my uterus completely scarred and fused together.\n\nI had surgery in June to remove the scarring BUT once you've scarred, you're prone to have it continue to happen. So after 2 months of hormone therapy, I head back in for a hysteroscopy to see if I've re-scarred and if my lining is healthy enough to start trying again.\n\nAfter being the worst case scenario in every situation this past year, I'm finding it hard to have any sort of hope for this appointment. I'm not trying to be negative- we've just had ZERO good news since October. It's been almost A YEAR without even being able to try to conceive again.\n\nIf anyone out there can send some hope or good juju into the universe for us that be great.

My cycles were pretty irregular before so it took extra long for me to get worried about it (and then I was just scared to go to a doctor).  Also, my tsh was a bit high so I'm currently on a small dose of synthroid \"just for while I'm trying to get pregnant.\" (but as far as I'm concerned they're going to have to rip that medication out of my cold dead hands).\n\nI was referred to an RE in June when my husband and I started trying (we didn't have to try for a year first, sweet!), and I feel like that's were things got derailed.  The RE sent us to see a Naturopath to see if we could get something going that way, and so that my body won't be \"fighting treatment\" if we decide to do drugs later.  He wanted me to take folate supplements for a few months anyway, so I didn't think there was any harm in trying it.  He also said something that scared my husband into thinking I'm going to have a miscarriage if we try drugs now, and it took forever to calm him down.\n\nSo now I'm taking a whole armada of supplements - 3 a day prenatal, vitex, myo-inositol, an extra folate supplement, seaweed for iodine, and (because I thought it made sense) vitamin D and omega-3s.  So far none of it has done a damn thing.\n\nI'm kind of waffling back and forth between thinking that if I can find the right supplement or the right diet I might be able to ovulate on my own, and thinking that nothing is ever going to work and I'm never going to have a baby.  I need to call my RE to go back and tell him to stfu with the natural voodoo and give me some drugs now please - or at least start the infertility work up he probably should have started months ago - but I've been procrastinating it and I probably won't get in to see him before October.  Or maybe I should get a new RE.\n\nMeanwhile one of my friends got pregnant by accident the same month my husband and I started trying, so I'm feeling extra down about my stupid body not working right.
