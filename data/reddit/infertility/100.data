I've been lurking for awhile and thought I should do an intro.\n\nMy husband and I have been TTC for 2.5 years. After 1 year of trying we both had full workups and everything was ok except AMH was on lower end (1.1), ovarian volume was highish, and there was one cyst visible on ultrasound. Over the next few months I discovered I was insulin resistant and shortly thereafter completely stopped having unmedicated periods. Basically I have a classic case of PCOS and likely ovulate very rarely. My husband and I had a hard time deciding how to proceed, he struggled to come to terms with the fact that it won't \"just happen\". \n\nI've done two medicated TI cycles (letrozole 5.0 + ovidrel trigger) with monitoring about a year ago. We were planning to try IUI and I was figuring out when to take the provera when I got my first spontaneous period in 2 years. (I think it may have been related to me working very hard on my blood glucose control but that's speculation at this point.) The IUI was this past Wednesday and the whole process was a bit of a whirlwind because I didn't expect my period. This time they upped the letrozole to 7.5.\n\nNow I'm twiddling my thumbs and trying not to overthink every weird body thing. All of the sudden I'm paying very close attention to how gassy I am.\n\nWhile I'm here I need to gush for a minute - this sub has been a safe haven for me. The emotional part of infertility has been so hard and my jealousy and sadness have been overwhelming. Hanging out here has made me feel so much less alone and made dealing with infertility, well not easier really, but definitely more peaceful. And I love the rules!

It's not a happy story, but it is how I found strange comfort in this terrible condition.\n\nAfter 3 years of living together, my amazing husband and I married in 2015 so we could start a family.  We were both 35 and very healthy.  After 2 years of trying with no success, we started assisted reproductive therapy.  \n\nHis sperm motility seemed fine, so we looked at me.  I wasn't making many eggs, about 6-8 each cycle.  Throughout our journey, we found the problem lay in my egg quality, but this was frustrating because there was nothing else wrong with me - no common causes of infertility, no health issues, nothing testable, just crappy eggs.  My doctors told me science doesn't know how to get women to make better eggs, just inject a megaton of hormones and hope for a lot of eggs.  But the more hormones I got, the fewer eggs I made.  We did 2 complete retrieval cycles, and 2 abandoned cycles (my ovaries shut down on one, and there was medication mis-communication on the other), and one failed IUI.  My doctor told me I was on my own with the egg quality and suggested I 'look into supplements'.\n\nThroughout this time, my husband began behaving bizarrely.  He quit participating in chores, didn't help me manage the fertility treatments, didn't help explore anything that might magically improve egg quality, and even started floating the idea separation.  I always called him out, and he always reaffirmed his commitment to me regardless of family outcome.  I thought it was so strange that my wonderful and loving husband would have these bouts of strangeness and be so unsupportive when we both affirmed that family was our #1 priority.  But I knew we were both under so much stress so I kept letting it go.\n\nWe got one PGS-tested genetically normal embryo, and everything seemed like it might work out... a month later it did not.  My doctors said that happens, but it was still odd.  \n\nThat was 1 year ago.  This year has been a downward spiral of my husband's odd and increasingly abusive behavior.  Last month he had a complete psychotic break, was arrested, and involuntarily committed to a psych ward.  It turns out he was bipolar the whole time.  Neither of us knew.  Looking back, all of his inconsistent and nonsensical behavior was mental illness.  When he was released after several weeks, he was still manic and delusional.  He moved out and divorced me.  Infertility certainly can break up couples, so I don't know if this would have been the outcome without the mental illness or not.\n\nI am so thankful we were unable to start a family together.  Just caring for himself will be (and has been) a challenge for him; he would not have been able to help care for me and a child.  Non-bipolar partners are often caretakers, and that would have been so stressful on top of a child.  Bipolar can be managed, but it can take years to find a regime that works - I wouldn't want to subject a child to the instability and cruelness of that disease as he figures out what works and what doesn't.  And bipolar is highly heritable.  \n\nI love my never-children with all my heart, and not bringing them into this situation is the best kindness that happened to them.  I'm not sure I believe in fate, or greater powers, but all the suffering and loss during my infertility journey was certainly the smaller of the possible heartbreaks.

I get how important it is to have proper care.\n\nMy RE said he uses the scissors (no heat) and said that treatment after (balloon, hormones) will be dependent on how bad it is when he sees it. I have never been pregnant and the scar tissue was detected by a Sonohystagram after my endometriosis surgery a few weeks ago. It appears to only be one small band, but obviously the hysteroscopy will show what's going on.\n\nI believe my RE does these pretty frequently (at least a few cases per month), and he honestly didn't seem too concerned about it. In reading how many women have it recur, I'm really, really scared now. I don't want more complications or damage since the endometriosis is also out to get me. I just did my first round of IVF and only got 1 egg due to endo (and it didn't make it), so will be trying again next month before moving to other options. My RE wants to get rid of the tissue (obviously) before I do a transfer (if I get to that point).\n\nDoes anyone have success stories with a doc who wasn't one of the 2 or 3 specialists?

I've been a part of this group for a few years now and appreciate all the support and knowledge that exists here. I would like to ask for some advice for my next steps in treatment, as I am not sure what to do. \n\n**My history:** \n\nI'm 34f and my husband is 37m. We are both healthy and active with no chronic conditions, besides my depression and anxiety and low (but not clinically low) thyroid for which I take Synthroid daily. \n\nWe started trying when I turned 30 in 2016. After an unsuccessful year, we got some testing done and learned my husband had very low motility. He went on Clomid and supplements which helped some but we still didn't have success.\n\nIn 2018 we did 3 medicated IUIs. The 2nd IUI was a positive but ended up being ectopic that was resolved with one round of methotrexate. After the second IUI I had a polypectomy but no success afterward. After looking through all my paperwork I discovered that my AMH was .9 (from a test in early 2018). When I asked my fertility nurse practitioner about this she said that my AFC was always good so she wasn't worried about it. I had it re-tested in Dec. 2018 and it was .6. I also have the MTFHR gene, however the type that is less consequential (I forget the name exactly). \n\nEarly 2019 we had two IVF consultations. One MD said his biggest concern was my AMH level and diagnosed me with DOR, but before going into treatment we decided to take a break and travel. This was an amazing mental//emotional break. It was like we were remembering how to have fun again. I had another polypectomy in Dec. 2019 to prepare for IVF in 2020. \n\n**January 2020 -- Egg Retrieval:** \n\nMy protocol included 300IU Gonal F, 150IU Menopur, LDN, and .25g Cetrotide. For several months leading up to retrieval I was taking Theralogix Prenatals, DHEA 75mg/daily, Vitamin D, Fish Oil, baby aspirin and Inositol. I ended up with 5 eggs, three mature, two fertilized and made it to blast on day 6. Both were PGS normal however their grades were 3bc and 3cc.\n\nWe were planning to do FET in March but due to Covid that changed. We ended up transferring the 3bc in late July, however it failed. My protocol for the FET included LDN, Estrace, Z-pak, prednisone, baby aspirin, prograf, lovenox, progesterone suppositories and PIO. At the time of transfer my lining was tri-laminar and 9.96mm, estrogen 105, progesterone 19.9.\n\nI had a phone call with an NP to review what happened. Basically there was no indication as to why the transfer failed and we discussed next steps. Here are my options: what do you think? \n\n**Option One:** \n\n\\-SIS to determine if I have more polyps preventing implantation. If so, move onto polypectomy. \n\n\\-ERA to determine best transfer time. \n\n\\-FET with last remaining embryo (3cc)\n\n**Option Two:** \n\n\\-SIS to determine if I have more polyps preventing implantation. If so, move onto polypectomy. \n\n\\-Egg retrieval with lower dose protocol. The NP recommended 200IU Gonal F, 10mg Letrozole, HcG, and lupron trigger. She also recommended adding the Female Endocrine Pack supplements to the others I took for the first round. \n\n\\- Fresh transfer. I've read that while frozen transfers may result in higher live births, patients who are low responders to stims have better results with fresh transfers. ([https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180821112013.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180821112013.htm))\n\n*OR*\n\n\\-ERA then FET\n\n**Additional details:** \n\n* We live in Alaska where there are NO IVF clinics, only NPs that do IUIs. We use CNY Fertility and have been using their Albany clinic, but now that they merged and have a location in Colorado Springs, we plan to get treatment there. I can do the SIS, polypectomy, ERA and all monitoring in Alaska, but all ER and FET require extensive travel.\n* My husband is mentally and emotionally done with this process. He wants to give up. I don't. It's fun. \n* My embryos are PGS normal, but poorly graded. If I do an ER and I get more embryos I'm considering putting in more than one.\n\n**TL;DR:** My first IVF FET failed, I have one more poorly graded PGS normal embryo. Do I go through an ERA and potentially a third polypectomy for this one embryo OR do ER and possible fresh transfer?

(Eventually also Cetrotide and Novarel).\n\nWatched many youtube videos and read reddit forums the days leading up, and spent probably a good 30mins prepping things, totally amateur style and not without trouble, but this post is about the actual injection.  \nI inserted Gonal F Rediject pen slooowly; when it was all the way in I struggled to reach the back of the pen with my thumb but finally clicked it, counted to five and then pulled out.  Suddenly there's lots of blood everywhere - like actually running down my tummy and even spilling on the floor!   It didn't hurt but I definitely wasn't expecting that and I could feel myself getting dizzy, like the stupid chickenshit that I am.   Started googling and quickly found out that was not a common thing and that I'd had to check with a nurse in the morning, but at least it was done. One down one to go!  Then I looked at the pen to make sure it said '0'.  Guess what?  It still said 225!  I had injected absolutely nothing..  \nLooking at the pen a little closer I realized there is another 'level' of movable area in addition to that tip edge click and that this area increases the higher the dose is.  So I hadn't pressed hard enough.. or I guess, like, at all!  My first site of injection had already formed a big bruise (today it's dark blue and about the size of a pencil eraser).     \nDisheartened I changed the needle tip to a fresh one and started googling a bunch of new youtube videos - then found an Australian version that mentioned that the closer to a 90 degree angle you insert the needle the less bruising you will have.  I had done mine closer to 45 degrees on the first try -to me that 90 degree straight stab just always looked so dramatic and painful!- but decided less bruising would be a good idea now that I already had two belly buttons...    \nThis time the needle wouldn't even go in.  Like it just h u r t.  I thought at first my muscles were too tense but then realizing I wasn't even trying to inject into a muscle so that didn't make sense.  At this point I considered just giving up altogether.  I ended up sitting down, with legs out in front of me.  I'd been standing because the girl in every video was standing.  \nSo I sit down and now it finally works.  Needle goes in, straight 90 degree angle, it doesn't hurt and it doesn't bleed.  But I am really struggling to reach that back button with my thumb and press it all the way down, especially without wiggling the pen around while in me.  I want to do things slowly and don't want to push the pen/needle further into my stomach by applying too much pressure on the back of the pen, if that makes sense?  I manage somehow, but it takes much longer than it probably should.  At least there's no more bleeding and the exit goes ok.  Pen read 0!  \nWith Menopur this problem gets worse, because  I want to go especially slow to avoid the burn I've been reading about.  Everyone says slow and steady is key.  But when I finally have the needle inserted fully there is no way to be steady while trying to push down the presser-thing on the syringe!  Since I'm holding the syringe with that same hand, I only have the thumb free to press but it's not easily 'pressable' with one finger and I don't want to push down hard and suddenly get momentum so that everything goes in at once.  I try and push lightly and it literally doesn't move.  I consider letting go of the skinfold pinch with my left hand so it can help hold the syringe in order to control the movement more steadily, but don't know exactly what the skinfold's purpose it so don't.    \nAt one point, just sitting there with the needle in my stomach and a syringe full but too chickenshit to push down on I just looked around me and was like 'well now what guys?'  It was ridiculous.  I finally managed to get it all in - somehow - but definitely wiggled both the needle and syringe around and probably had it in me for close to a minute.  The only good thing though; it didn't burn, at least not until the very very end and it was very minor, and there was no bleeding on the exit.  And left no bruise, so I only have that one big one from the first failed attempt.  \nBut now I'm sitting here, hours away from the next round of injections and thinking there has to be some better way of doing this... Why can I not find anybody else talking about this missing-extra-hand problem?  Am I just an idiot?  Are my hands too small?  Does nobody else have problems pressing the syringe or pen for injections when holding with same hand?  Am I just too chickenshit for this stuff? (Probably..)  \nAny tips help!!!    \nAnd thanks for reading all that... I'm doing this all alone (to salvage some eggs) and nobody in my life knows and so I don't have any shoulders to cry, or laugh, on.

Had my egg retrieval this morning. Got 9 eggs but not optimistic as AFC scan found the eggs not in sync and very variable with most in 14mm while 2 in 20mm. The mid-sized ones didnt seem to progress in last scan and RE suggested to trigger anyways for the 20mm eggs. Not sure if the smaller ones can become mature.\n\nI had this bad feeling when I stepped out from recovery room and didnt see my husband. Nurse said he was still in the room trying to produce the sperms. He has on and off ED and I already knew he wouldnt be able to make it. Another hour went by and nurse suggested us to return home and try to get a sample and return to the clinic by 2pm. That was like 2.5 hours away from the deadline. I wanna rush home and give him more space and privacy to try. But he didnt seem to worry about it and insisted we had lunch first. By the time we got home, it was already 1pm. \n\nHis member just remained placid. He looked at the clock like every 5 minutes. I tried to stay nice saying its okay and dont worry. But deep down I was so angry at my destiny and at him. I bought him supplements but he always forgets to take them. I have to put them in pillbox and he still complains there are too many capsules to swallow. He is overweight and seldom exercises. I have a full time job working long hours trying to keep up with mortgage and all the IVF expenses. He has not worked for several years and I dont even demand tangible contribution. I feel like this infertility journey put extra strain on our marriage.\n\nThis will be my last egg retrieval as I need to undergo a uterine fibroid surgery and wait for 6 months before trying again. By then I will be almost 40. I am crying bitterly for my screwed up life not being able to become a mother. I am pissed of why I need to go through all this trouble. I dont smoke or drink. I eat okay and not overweight. I consider myself a good person. I am angry with a lot of things. Why do some people just get pregnant so easily and so casually and yet they opt for termination or mistreating their kids? Why are there so many of us trying so hard yet we get nothing? I am glad I can vent to you gals here at reddit. I dont have any friends who truly understand the grief, anger, self blame, self pity that I am going through in past 6 years. Not even my husband gets it. His words irritate me when they are meant to give me support. He appears nonchalant and says he doesnt get why I need to cry or be upset about it. He said if I give up motherhood then I dont have to go through the hassle of endless doctors appt, scans, injection and upcoming operation. I couldnt help but got infuriated and sobbed bitterly when I heard his words. So my cycle simply got wasted. I have spent 23K in past half year of blood work, scans, failed IUI and egg retrievals. I have to fork out another 22K for my fibroid surgery. Thats really all I have in all these years saving. I cant afford another cycle anymore. I am angry at him for not trying harder to have a healthier lifestyle not just for the sperms or for us but for his own good.\n\nSorry I sound so bitter. I cant help but feeling so defeated and heartbroken. This infertility journey makes me feel like I am a loser making so many wrong decisions.

About a year ago about my fertility concern and she told me to take prenatals and after trying for a year come back to her. I also have a problem appointment this month on the 28th. \nOkay so quick run down of my history so there\u2019s no questions and so I can get the best answer out of this: I had nexplanon implanted in 2015 and taken out early in 2018 I was on Nuva ring until May of 2019 knowing that it would be about 6 months until it completely wore off for lack of a better word. Me and my husband have been trying since that August to get pregnant. My periods have been normal since 2020 January. I had an ovarian cyst rupture this past June. Haven\u2019t had another one since and no issues until now. We both began taking fertility supplements the first of this month and I was tracking my ovulation. I had an LH surge the 28-31st of August. I was due for my period the 10th of this month and still have not gotten it. I took an ovulation test everyday since the 10th (thinking maybe I miss read the tests earlier the past week and was maybe ovulating late) and got high positives everyday until two days ago (so 8 days high positives) and negative pregnancy tests. (Tested every 5 days) \nSo, my question is does anyone have any good insight on what maybe going on, and or what questions I should ask my doctor on my upcoming visit.

I'm very grateful at this point that I never had a kid with my abusive ex, but I'm concerned for my future. \n\nThat aside, one of my best friends just had a baby. I've been somewhat involved in the pregnancy (as much as I can be; the pandemic makes caution even more of a necessity) and have done my best to be there for my friend. When she was pregnant, it felt...so surreal. We talked and I told her that I was afraid it would be \"creepy\" of me to want to be there for her because of my past miscarriages. I felt like I would be seen as crazy. She told me she didn't think it was creepy at all, and has been wanting to talk to me about it but didn't want to trigger me. It was a good bonding moment and I got to feel the baby kick, and we got weepy together. I thought that was the end of my weird emotions around this. I was wrong. \n\nSince the baby was born, I've been crying. Mostly just happy tears; the baby came very early and I was scared, but is as healthy as can be and is so precious. But I've been having dreams where I see pictures on facebook of all our friends visiting the baby, but I wasn't invited. I keep feeling like I have no right to ever want to see the baby, and that it's been stupid of me to buy gifts for the baby and think that I could be in their life. I'm embarrassed of feeling so attached to this baby when I couldn't even bring mine to term. I feel like I've just been projecting my want to nurture a baby onto my friend and her pregnancy, and that it's selfish and wrong.

Thought I almost got an ovarian torsion or something as it was a sudden acute pain over L lower abdomen and I had to curl up on bed the whole day and luckily it resolved after a weekend rest.\n\nMay - stopped for a month due to poor asthma control\n\nJune - RE put me on Suprecur (Burserelin) nasal spray. Thats sorta work as an agonist protocol, at first stimulating the pituitary to produce FSH/LH for few days then later spray will exhaust the receptors and stop body from making FSH/LH.  Then started stim injection. I used Menopur &amp; rFSH. Ovaries were not too responsive and appeared dormant. AFC only 4-5 but all small according to the cycle day.  But progesterone become too high and uterus out of sync and too advanced in cycle, unlikely to have success in implantation.  IUI was cancelled and told to have sex on my own.  Obviously didnt achieve anything.\n\nJuly - Similar protocol as of June ie Spray(increase frequency from twice per day to four times) + Menopur/rFSH injection, this time progesterone okay and proceeded to IUI but no success\n\nAugust - Suprecur nasal spray 12 days &amp; stim injection 10 days (Rekovelle + Luveris) and Saizen was added for the last 8 days of stim; Saizen 1 unit/day; yielded 13 eggs, 6 blasts\n\nSeptember - Suprecur nasal spray 12 days &amp; stim injection 8 days (Rekovelle + Luveris + Saizen), clinic premixes everything together so I just have to do one shot per night. Again Saizen was given at 1 unit/day for 8 days;  yielded 9 eggs\n\nAbove are my experiences. I am glad my RE is open to change of protocol or drug choices. She is willing to switch and try out everything instead of asking one to retry similar protocol over and over.\n\nI am not sure if I am biased but I think Saizen (HGH) does help. It doesnt seem to do harm so might as well include it. Another factor is the human derived Rekovelle and Luvaris. I am more responsive to these meds than my previous cycles with hampster derived Menopur and recombinant rFSH.\n\nRE said the human derived stims used to cost more and somehow the companies have a discount for them for recent few months so she switched me to the regime. I think the injection of the human derived stims are less painful then Menopur and rFSH. \n\nI also take several supplements:\n\nDHEA: 25mg once daily from CD1 then increase to twice daily on CD 8-9 and max out to three times for last few days till egg retrieval\n\nOmega: twice a day of preparation in form of 500EPA/250DHA\n\nMultiple Vit: the special vitamins formulated for ART, included CoQ10,  Inositol, Melatonin \n\nTru Niagen: a special form of B3, NAD+, supposed to combat anti-ageing, some small studies in mice showed that it help with the reproductive system\n\nGreen Powder: just drink for antioxidant effect assuming that can help ovaries or eggs from oxidative stress\n\nI am desparate and basically put everything in. I dont think those extra HGH or supplements will do any harm. I just hope to boost my ovaries for few months to get the eggs out to bank up. \n\nI am not so diligent to read up about the details of IVF. I just rely on what my RE decision and listen to her on what to do. Now with first hand experience, hope the info will be useful to some of you. Some REs tend to be convervative and a bit old school. Allowing 3-4 months for RE to work out what the problems lie.

We had to wait an additional year for insurance to be eligible and just had the retrieval last week with 22 eggs. Our beliefs of destroying embryos along with our determination that we could not bear to give away excess embryos and not get to know our own child led us after days upon days of deliberation to conclude that we would rather hurt our chances of conceiving and elect for only a certain amount of embryos to be fertilized vs being stuck with a decision we could not make. My wife and the doctor deliberated this too because he thought at least 10 should be fertilized for success,but she wasn\u2019t comfortable with more than 5. We finally settled for 8 after he pushed that to be successful we would need at least that many. Our notarized contract stated that we wanted 8 embryos fertilized and the rest frozen for future use. Day 1 our embryologist ,obviously unknowing of our request, told us that of the 22 eggs 16 were mature and of those 16, 14 had successfully fertilized. In shock my wife told her we only wanted 8 to be fertilized. The embryologist put us on hold to \u201ccheck her notes\u201d and after 6-10 minutes came back and said the Dr. had been notified and would be contacting us shortly.  He then called 5 min later and apologized more the \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and said he had in his notes that he wanted to revisit the number of embryos we wanted to fertilize and they were trying to source where the misstep happened and ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.

Can produce exactly zero contribution to the process.\n\nSo when the paperwork arrived I didn't read it, I just read the date at the top, saved it in my calendar, and got in with life.\n\nSo the wife on Friday messages me \"You need to do those tests\" so I look at the email properly.

Can they magically jump from me via no physical or fluid contact back in time to infect my frozen samples?\"\n\nN: \"Ahh I see, well it's policy\"\n\nMe: \"Why? You are the people that everyone says to come to in our situation where the man can no longer produce, everyone says to come to you as the experts in the state, I just want to know why/how this is relevant, if it wasn't relevant months and years ago, those samples are a snapshot in time, nothing I do now can change them\"\n\nN: \"Look Sir, you can discuss this with the doctor at your first appointment, but it's policy because of the risks of transmission.

They have no other option here.\n\nI mean, I am 100% sure I don't have anything, so that's not a concern, but after all these years of cancer bullshittery, I'm just sick and tired of being jabbed with needles.

We realize the AM/PM distinction doesn't work for every timezone, just use the most recently posted one (you can sort the sub by \"new\" to find this easily).  It also helps tremendously if you upvote the daily threads when you see them so they stay at the top of the sub making them easier for others to find.\n\nThe daily Treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or treatment related questions.  If it's about diagnostics, medications, treatment options - it's treatment.  It's a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help or commiserate with others on the effects and hardships related to treatment and diagnostics.\n\nThe daily Chat threads are for anything and everything NOT related to treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won't stop asking about when you're having kids? Funny story? Rant? Accomplished something you are proud of?  These all go in the Chat thread. This is a great place to get to know fellow members outside of their treatment or diagnosis.  The chat thread is infertility friendly, but it is a space for folks that are benched, between treatment, or not pursuing treatment.  It's somewhere to talk about things other than treatment with folks that understand the impact infertility trauma has on everything else in our lives.  \n\nHave a question that you think might warrant a standalone post or doesn't fit in the treatment/chat threads?

There are over 20,000 subscribers here with the majority having gone through several different courses of treatment.  Use specific titles for your posts to make them more easily searched by users. \"IVF?\" is not super helpful. \"MFI and Endo, First round of IVF - Should we do ICSI?\" is more likely to get useful responses and easier for future members to find in search.\n\nExamples of appropriate stand alone:\n\n* A detailed intro post with medical history is totally appropriate as a standalone, particularly when it's paired with treatment/diagnoses related questions.\n\n* Posting new research and including your thoughts on why it's relevant, what common beliefs it may challenge, or follow on questions related to the impact of the information.\n\n* Asking for advice on a treatment plan with your relevant history and including what you are concerned about or why you feel a \"community opinion\" would be helpful.\n\nExamples of posts that are not appropriate stand alone:\n\n* An intro that says, \"hey new here, anyone doing IVF?\"\n\n* Posting just a link to research (particularly not from a primary source - like PopSugar, Medium, HuffPost, etc) with \"just saw this\"\n\n* Posting the doctor told me to take \"150 menopur, what do you think?

I have always had irregular cycles and I really struggled with anorexia as a young adult which lead me to having a very low body weight and as a result absent cycles for several years. I was diagnosed with lean PCOS in May. I was also referred to an NHS specialist to get further fertility support but my apt was cancelled as I managed to get pregnant in July using the Ovusense body thermometer to track my ovulation. I miscarried at 4 weeks and was put on Metformin by my GP. I managed to ovulate this cycle as well (on day 57) and got a very faint positive test at 15 dpo that never got any darker. I started bleeding heavily on the weekend.\n\nHas any one experienced anything similar? I have only been on Metformin for a month and a bit, but should I have noticed any differences by now?\n\nI booked myself into a private specialist so that I can at least start getting some answers to my questions. I'm just wondering what I can expect from it. Can I just come out and ask to try Letrozole or Clomid? I don't even truly know much about either of them.    \nMy GP is so limited in giving me any information at all as she reminds me she is not a specialist. \n\nAny support is so greatly appreciated.

I am sure plenty of others have done this but I didn\u2019t find many posts about the mechanics of it.\n\nI had a strong reluctance to do a D&amp;C because of a fussy lining, and strong desire to test because my miscarriage was of a PGS normal embryo. But whatever your reasoning, I wanted to share my experience in case it is helpful. This was for the Natera / Anora test but I would expect the basic method would be fine for other POC tests. \n\nNote: My clinic kind of discouraged me from doing this, saying it is \u201cmessy\u201d and \u201ceasy to contaminate,\u201d and acting like testing at home is unusual, and was generally a hot mess about the process. They managed the miscarriage fine (a nurse called me both days, answered questions about the drug), but gave me basically no clear guidance about the sample collection and testing process specifically. In retrospect I am really irritated by this: we took basic steps and got a testable sample, and I think home collection is just not a standard process so they simply didn\u2019t want to do it. Unacceptable! Obviously emotionally this is a difficult thing to do, but operationally, I found it possible and feel like they should better support patients who want to do it. Of course, how it goes will depend on how your body processes the drugs, and it may be harder for others than it was for me.\n\nIn any case, I will stick to the details of sample collection and testing, not my experience with Cytotec/Misoprostol, which I think is well covered on other posts. Obvious goriness and miscarriage trigger warnings abound.\n\nSupplies:\n\u2014Large glass or metal mixing bowl (the biggest that will fit inside your toilet bowl)\n\u2014Gloves (we used some unopened gloves for washing dishes, because that is what we had on hand)\n\u2014Bottle of saline spray (saline solution in a spray bottle - this is probably not necessary but my husband thought to get it and it worked well)\n\u2014Ziplock bag, disinfected tupperware, and/or collection cup and 1-2 oz of saline solution (you can order a kit from Natera ahead of time that contains this or buy it separately)\n\u2014Insulated grocery bag\n\u2014Ice pack (or ziplock with ice wrapped in a thin towel)\n\nIf you are doing Anora, even if you are testing at home, your doctor will need to order the test otherwise your sample won\u2019t be processed, so just make sure they do that.\n\nThe night before starting Cytotec/Misoprostol, we ran the bowl through the dishwasher by itself on the \u201cdisinfect\u201d cycle and put it in the bathroom that we decided to reserve for this purpose (having 2 bathrooms is helpful, one to use normally and one to use for this). Also put the spray saline, regular saline, ziplock/tupperware, collection cup and the gloves in the bathroom.\n\nLater the next day (Day 1), about 4pm after taking my first dose of Cytotec at 6am, I started feeling like I might pass something and went into the bathroom. We placed the bowl in the toilet in case at this time. My husband also poured all of the regular saline that came in the kit from Natera into the collection cup per the instructions (we had ordered the kit by emailing them and asking for it, and they over nighted it at no cost). However, as mentioned above, you can also just buy some saline and use your own container. In general, we found it helpful to have extra saline.\n\nAs I passed stuff, my husband was able to use the spray saline to help clean things off in the bowl and figure out what was potentially useful tissue and what was blood clots. If you order the Natera kit they will send an insert with pictures, but it\u2019s basically just anything white, grayish, or light pink is useful and dark red is blood clots. You don\u2019t want blood clots because they can contaminate the sample. \n\nIf you are not sure about some of the tissue, spray it with saline or place it in extra saline if you have it and then put it in an \u201cintermediate vessel\u201d (e.g., ziplock or tupperware) for a few hours or overnight. Then reevaluate and decide if you want to add it to the final collection container that will go to the lab. We found that it was easier to see what was really there after it sat for awhile as the blood clots mostly dissolved. Likewise, if you are doing this alone and you need a minute (or many minutes) to recover before dealing with the sample, you do not need to be in a huge hurry to figure it out and put it into the fridge right away, waiting a bit may actually make it easier to see.\n\nWhen ready, use the gloves to move the tissue to the collection cup and place it in the refrigerator. I had to take another dose the next day (Day 2) but did not get any tissue. We would have just added it to the collection cup if I had. \n\nDay 3: I went in to get an ultrasound to see if I had passed all the tissue, which I had. We brought the sample with us to the appointment in an insulated grocery bag with an ice pack.\n\nAfter my ultrasound, my clinic sent me up to the surgery floor where they do D&amp;C\u2019s because they usually do the kits as part of D&amp;C\u2019s, and frankly, no one else seemed to have any idea what to do with it/me. Finally one of the surgery nurses came out with the main form for the kit for me to fill out (needed to then be signed by the doc on call which she later took care of), and she drew my blood to include in the kit. She then took the kit for me and shipped off to Natera. If I had required a D&amp;C, I would have requested more tissue be collected during the D&amp;C and everything sent to Natera. I think the fact that I had the sample with me helped demand that they figure this out *right away* vs sending me home and back into process confusion or making me take care of the shipping myself.\n\nNote on alternatives: If your clinic won\u2019t ship for you or is confused, there are instructions in the kit about how to ship yourself (for Natera, using Fedex and a specific box). And if your clinic is being especially unhelpful and getting the blood draw is complicated, there is an alternative cheek swab option enclosed and/or Natera told me that you can also send the blood separately. They also said is fine for the blood to sit up to two days in the refrigerator if you are doing this over a weekend or holiday, which I was. If you are using donor eggs, the kit says that paternal blood or cheek swab is fine.\n\nShipping: if you collect over the weekend, shipping should be by default on a Monday if using Fedex. I collected over Labor day weekend though \u2014 tissue collected on Saturday, clinic shipped on Tuesday, didn\u2019t actually arrive to Natera until Thursday, and it was still fine.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 20567, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "POC / Natera / Anora \u2014 Home Collection", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ix7507/poc_natera_anora_home_collection/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LaGrippeResearchAlex", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_773jo337", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1600717056, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ix7l0n/endometriosis_project/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ix7l0n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ix7l0n/endometriosis_project/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Sorct-p_6GU7fDLF7spXPDJwkErqSyPzkSXHXQhJR0c", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99e342e53c1da6ad64e5191890a68011aa208652", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b01d1c9285c306afb96be09b8add7ce737ab64a", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93fc923dc20d601ecfe9365d8b4c99b488ee2a11", "width": 320}, {"height": 334, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eb5233ee7c70f54b32940bae05103111db84520", "width": 640}, {"height": 502, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af7a9b1b78500e8b5e63df4727c565eaa3cf4c8", "width": 960}, {"height": 565, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fd9999061823901076cf5a93d8eda1adc6fc2bf", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 628, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f6f55b828d7b119a03162c74b4f7e141744b9abf", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1600717066, "score": 1, "selftext": " My name is Maggie, and I am with LaGrippe Research.

At first we thought it was due to him having a low sperm count due to varicocele, but it turns out I only have one fallopian tube as well, so the odds of us getting pregnant on our own are very small.\n\nWe have a meeting with a fertility specialist next week, but I'm really feeling like we are both somehow broken, or something is badly wrong with us that we cannot have kids like many people do. Like we do not fit in with the rest of the world somehow. I'm so worried about the cost of everything, too. My state requires coverage of infertility but the lifetime max is 25k, which I think we will quickly go over. \n\nAnyway, I was wondering if anyone else has felt this and if so, how do you get past it? I literally want to cry thinking about it. Both of our lives have not been easy and we have overcome a lot, but I feel like it is just another hurdle in our way, and I'm not sure if we can do anything to get past it. It hurts a lot.\n\nThank you.  And I read the rules and am hoping this is not bothering anyone in any way.
