We love this church very much and have been going since it started in our pastor's living room and have seen it grow to 2 services.  We serve on some ministries and are active in our community group (much like Bible study, we meet one night a week).\n\nYesterday,  our community group leaders, who happen to be good friends of ours as well, invited us over for lunch to talk about stuff.  I had a feeling that they didn't agree with our choices after our first talk with them when they kept asking if \"we had considered adoption\".    Well I felt steam rolled yesterday, they told us that we should pray to God to heal my husband's MFI and that we should ask the elders of the church to pray over us.  Do they not realize that we've been praying about this since last September????  They went on to talk about their concerns about the preservation of life and the questions that will arise when/if we have extra embryos.  Again, things that are also weighing on us heavily.  Mind you these friends are our age, and also had a baby 4 months ago.  Our church is full of young couples, I started crying in church again yesterday because 3 pregnant ladies walked by not to mention 2 very tiny newborns.  \n\n\nNone of this helps, not to mention we finally had our consultations with two separate clinics last week so we could make a decision on where we want to go.  I believe in God, I'm not angry at Him for our situation.  But I also don't believe that he's some magical genie that is going to solve our problem.  I don't want to go to church anymore and as much as I care about our community group leaders I don't want to be around them right now.  They also sent us [this](http://www.thevillagechurch.net/sermon/should-christians-use-contraceptive-methods-and-reproductive-technologies/) article explaining their position.

But I also know that it is time. We don\u2019t have the emotional strength or financial resources to continue trying for something that may never happen. And I need to focus on my physical and mental health, both of which have suffered greatly these past 5 years of trying to conceive.\n\n\nThe decision was both sudden and long-expected. A year ago, my husband and I decided that we would try a third and final IVF before stopping treatment and moving on with our lives. Our first two IVFs were unsuccessful and yielded poor quality embryos. A last attempt would be our insurance against regrets and a reasonable stopping point. The plan made sense to us. \n\n\nBut that third attempt never happened. On top of my history of PCOS and endometrial hyperplasia, there were thyroid issues. Then a uterine polyp. We started to stim for an IVF attempt, only to have to cancel due to zero follicle growth. Then there was a troublesome cyst, resulting in a lap that also revealed endometriosis and scarring. More thyroid issues and especially concerning to my RE, an increased hbA1C and skyrocketing insulin levels despite being on Metformin. She strongly believes that high insulin levels affect egg quality. Given the history of our poor-quality embryos, she recommended we not proceed with another IVF at this time. When my husband and I considered all factors, including our ages of 39 and 44, we decided we didn\u2019t want to wait. We wanted to stop. We could have insisted on trying a cycle now, or we could have waited until my numbers improved. We could get other opinions or switch clinics. But, we decided the universe has been telling us to stop and it was time.\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t live with the cycle of hope and devastation any longer. I know many people can balance infertility within the context of the rest of their life. I couldn\u2019t. It consumed me. The chronic migraines, depression, and anxiety disorder that had been under control before we started trying have become debilitating. My career has imploded, my sense of confidence and self-worth shattered. I need to reclaim my life, focus on my health, and find a sense of purpose again. And I couldn\u2019t do it while fighting my body with infertility treatment.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two months since we made the decision to stop. The first month was unbearable grief. I sobbed multiple times a day. I\u2019m still devastated. I don\u2019t how or when or if I\u2019ll ever truly accept the reality of never having a baby. I think maybe I\u2019m coping with a sort of numb denial at the moment, a state of shock. I have a list of therapists to contact for when I\u2019m ready to face and talk about it.\n\n\nAnd yet, I know I\u2019ve made the right decision. The thought of restarting treatment is terrifying. I can\u2019t do it again. I\u2019ve started treating my health, taking the meds I need, without fear of what it might do to a potential fetus. Because of my history of hyperplasia, I will be on some form of progesterone or birth control for the rest of my life, making a surprise pregnancy literally impossible. It\u2019s probably better for me psychologically to not have that thread of hope, however slight. And it lets me treat my health worry-free.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what my life will look like in the future. But I know it will be better than the awful limbo of uncertainty of the past few years. I\u2019m thankful for my husband and my parents and siblings who have been sources of absolute support. And while I\u2019ve lost some friends through the years, I\u2019ve made some wonderful new ones. I\u2019ll have to figure out a new career path. I don\u2019t want to return to the classroom. It would be too exhausting, too painful. But there are options out there. I\u2019m trying to accept that life will simply be different from what I had imagined. Holidays and facebook and children everywhere out in the world will probably be painful for long a time. But I have to believe that there is happiness to be found.\n\n\nThe adoption question looms. I am on the fence. Some days I feel certain I want to experience motherhood by any means. Other days, I just don\u2019t want to do it for a number of reasons.  There are a lot of feelings of guilt about it. My husband is open to the idea, though I think he\u2019s enjoying the part-time nature of being uncle to our nephews. The emotions are too raw and too intense right now, and we decided we weren\u2019t going to make any decisions about adoption one way or the other for at least 6 months, maybe a year.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll live to regret this decision to stop treatment. I just know that the same way I knew I had to try, I now know that I have to stop.\n\n\nI\u2019ve already pulled back from this community greatly and though I miss it, I think to protect myself I\u2019ll need to step away for a good long while, maybe permanently. But I am so very grateful for the love and support and advice and friendship that I\u2019ve received here over the years. This is a truly special corner of the internet and I\u2019m lucky to have been a part of it.\n\n\nI wish you all happiness and peace of mind in whatever life may bring.\n\nWith love,\nDusty\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Post I Never Wanted to Write: Done With Treatment", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3xrvt0/the_post_i_never_wanted_to_write_done_with/"}, {"author": "drarchanadhawanbajaj", "author_created_utc": 1447738044, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_s48k7", "created_utc": 1450762151, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3xsta7/ivf_treatment_clinic_in_delhibest_ivf_treatment/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3xsta7", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3xsta7/ivf_treatment_clinic_in_delhibest_ivf_treatment/", "retrieved_on": 1454945276, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[removed]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "ivf treatment clinic in delhi,best ivf treatment cost in delhi", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3xsta7/ivf_treatment_clinic_in_delhibest_ivf_treatment/"}, {"author": "pinksultana", "author_created_utc": 1366171203, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_bch9f", "created_utc": 1450764414, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3xsxgy/christmas_movies_are_ruined/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3xsxgy", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 18, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3xsxgy/christmas_movies_are_ruined/", "retrieved_on": 1454945330, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I LOVE Christmas movies, it used to be my fav time in the lead up to Christmas.

I can't run to her with this IF battle. I can't cry in her lap. I can't trust to confide in her. I cant look for her for support. I don't like dwelling on poor me who had such a crap upbringing, but, my birth mother let her boyfriend abuse me and my older sisters. We were taken by CPS, and I was then adopted by an aunt and uncle, my God parents. I was much younger than their kids and in that house, I suffered some disgusting abuse by my uncle, and their oldest son. We grew up as siblings, but he was 16 years older. When she found out, she didn't come to my aid. She didn't protect me. She called me a slut.\n\nSo, as a Christian I forgive, but the damage has been done. I don't see either one of them as a mother. I don't have a mother, even though I have two. I have a mother in law, and while I know she's grown to care about me as a person, she'll always wish her son had married a white \"American\" woman. (Third gen Mexican-American here).\n\nI don't want to re-hash all of the turmoil, I *just want the chance to be a better mother.* You know? I want to be a pillar of support to my children. I want to shower them with love and protection. I want to be kind of mother my daughter/son would *run* to if she/he were me suffering with infertility. \n\nNot too long ago someone here said, no matter how old we get, we still want our mommas.

It's expensive.

We are paying her student loans, I'm not contributing to my retirement so that we can get her loans paid off, we are living with her parents and we had planned to pay off her loans and then save up to buy a new house.  \n\nI understand that a lot of people couldn't even consider the costs of IVF and we are fortunate that we can, but we will still have to pay the money back - with or with out a child.\n\nI think that maybe I'm just upset because I really have no choice in the matter.

I thought I was ok with not being a mom, but then had PTSD flashbacks in the waiting room at my gyno when I went for my annual (due to mixup with reception, we had our sono scheduled at 11 am and our appointment with the midwife was not until 3 pm.

Lunch with his family tomorrow which is always an unnecessary nightmare with my mother in law, and now there is a baby in the family to make it excruciating, but we have a 2pm leave time as we have booked 3 nights away to escape the extended family gatherings on the 26th and 27th. So 24 hours from now this will all be a horrible memory as I kick back with a stiff drink.\n\nSo 3 hours worth of inescapable Christmas endurance left. It's annoying because I used to love every aspect of Christmas, but infertility steals so much joy.\n\nHow's everyone else going?

Twins, triplets, etc. If you've talked with an RE, you know that this is not what they want to achieve - they want healthy singletons. Twins are a bit more risky than multiples, with lower birth weights, earlier delivery dates, and higher risk for cerebral palsy and a bunch of other things. But it's not that much riskier. Triplets and more, however, is. The average triplet is born at 33 weeks and weighs 4 pounds. \n\nIt's really, really tempting to think you're getting two for the price of one. All this treatment is expensive. But you want to know what's really expensive? Raising healthy twins. And sick twins, or triplets, is even moreso. I know how much it hurts to cancel a cycle, especially after you've spent so much money on procedures and medication, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of caring for multiples once they arrive.\n\nMultiples are a major risk for IUI when you've got 3 or more follicles. Kate Gosselin had her sextuplets on an IUI cycle with only 4 follicles - and she actually had seven but one fetus failed to develop. They can't always see all the follicles on scans, after all. \n\nThey're also a risk for IVF. We all know of Octomom, who transferred 12 embryos (assuming blasts) and got eight babies. Six implanted, and two of those split to form identicals. This is why so many REs push for Single Embryo Transfer. We can't stop the identicals from splitting, but we can avoid 3 or more by doing one at a time, even if it takes more cycles.\n\nAnd when you show up at the 8 week scan and there are three, or four, heartbeats? What then? If you try to carry all of them, you might lose all of them. You can opt for selective reduction, which is a fancy name for aborting some, but not all, of the fetuses. For some people, this is ok. For others, it's not. I just really want all of you to think about it, and to make your choice about what you'll do now, before you're stuck with an ultrasound probe against your abdomen with emotions running high. \n\nIf you decide now, with your partner, that you're absolutely not ok with selective reduction, then you can guide your own treatment to reduce the risk of multiples. Cancel IUI cycles with 4 or more follicles, or convert them to IVF if you've got a bunch. Stick to single embryo transfers, or at most two. If you decide that you're ok with selective reduction, you could be a bit more risky in your treatment options. \n\nWhatever you choose for yourself is the right choice. I don't want this to become an abortion debate, I just want you to think about this and make your choice now, with a clear head and heart, so that you're not blindsided should this happen.

Everyone was kind of surprised, because normally we know when there are adoptive babies being born. Since there is no newborn nursery here and babies just room in with the parents, adoptive babies hang out with us in the NICU. But we had no idea this one was coming. \n\nThe mother apparently found out she was pregnant at 33 weeks when getting an MRI. She and her husband are separated, divorcing, already have two kids, and neither of them wanted this baby. She didn't make any attempts to contact an adoption agency and just assumed that \"the government\" would take the baby. \n\nShe refused to look at, hold, or name the baby girl. She demanded to be discharged as soon as possible after giving birth so she \"wouldn't miss Christmas with her children.\" \n\nNow it is well within her rights to give up her little girl if she doesn't want her. Better for the baby too, rather than be raised in an unloving, broken home. It's totally understandable.\n\nBut it just broke my heart to see the social worker take her away to go to foster care today. The woman who gave birth to her is at home celebrating with her family. From what the nurses who cared for her said about her attitude, she probably isn't giving a second thought to the baby she carried and gave birth to. But she might be, she might be suffering. Who knows. \n\nI went to the store last night and bought a Christmas patterned baby blanket and onesie with snowflakes and penguins for her - I couldn't bear to see her taken out of here in a regular hospital blanket and no clothes of her own on Christmas. \n\nI'm not sure what the point of this post is, just that it's a hard situation to witness and makes me so sad right now. \n\nUPDATE: We learned that the family our little baby is going to today is a long term foster family, so they likely are the ones who will end up adopting her!

We went home to see our families, which was already a mistake because we were already both been dealing with cancer-related post traumatic stress this month. We went to my husband's big family gathering where right off the bat his (unmarried/younger) cousin announced her pregnancy. Some sad feelings came up but I really tried to keep them at bay, even saying to my husband \"well at least it wasn't your sister!\" Soon after, my husbands 96 year old grandpa asked him if we had kids, to which my husband replied no. Grandpa replied \"you still have time,\" which made my husband sad and emotional. It hurt so much to see him like that... \n\nI thought the hard parts were over and then at the smaller family gathering my sweet (younger) sister-in-law announced her pregnancy by gifting my MIL a framed ultrasound picture. It has been my dream to announce our pregnancy over Christmas, especially because I want to replace some horrific memories with beautiful ones for us... I feel so crushed. This should have been us too. We planned on trying naturally last fall before we knew my husband needed surgery last year (the surgery left him with retrograde ejaculation aka NO chance of conceiving naturally... i guess it doesn't make much of a difference since I don't fucking ovulate anyways), and instead we ended up doing IVF (with no transfer yet). \n\nI can't help but envy all of the people around me. They don't have a life of cancer hanging over them, they don't have to deal with infertility, and they have so many special moments like this as a result. I just feel like this has ripped out my heart (and made me a horrible person because I should only be happy that I get to be an aunt and that two people I love very much are going to be parents). We were hoping to be able to announce our pregnancy next Christmas, but now that just feels stupid. Feeling really sorry for myself right now. BTW- I have been saying for months that this would happen. At Thanksgiving I turned to my husband and said \"I think she is pregnant,\" which may have been before she even knew (she is 8 weeks now). I just knew it in my soul.\n\n:-(\n\nThanks for giving me a place to vent. You guys are one of only two places that I know  can go to for some understanding.

What rights do I have as a patient to push back on treatment that is more aggressive than I am comfortable with?\n\nFor background, I have PCOS with a high AMH for being 35 years old and my husband has severely low count that requires ICSI. IVF #1 was a pretty standard protocol for someone with my labs: BCPs and Lupron, then Gonal 150 and Menopur 75 with an Ovidrel trigger.  I had a huge amount of measurable follicles, 31, but retrieval only yielded 10 eggs, 8 of which were mature. My E2 was pretty much immediately high and I only stimmed for 8 days.  All 8 eggs fertilized with ICSI but failed to impress anyone with their development. We did a D3 transfer that ultimately failed, and ended up on D6 with a poor blastocyst and a morula, both of which were of too poor quality to freeze.\n\nMy RE said that for IVF #2 that she would just power through on the stims, push me to OHSS, and freeze on D2. We'd then unfreeze for a FET, let them develop, and then transfer. Any remaining blasts would be frozen.\n\nFirstly, how can knowingly pushing a patient into OHSS line up with \"do no harm\"?  She seems to think that OHSS isn't a big deal.  Secondly, the freeze-unfreeze-freeze thing just feels like a way to ultimately charge me twice for freezing. That feels predatory to me.  Also, since we had poor embryo development last time, there's a risk that nothing will develop and we will have lost 4 months (waiting for the FET then waiting to stim again).  That is stressing me out. \n\nMy insurance company has an independent IVF nurse resource that I can use, and she and I both agree that since I'm a high responder that a low-and-slow stim is far more appropriate and better for me physically, to reduce the chances of OHSS.  We would start at Gonal 150 and Menopure 75, and once my E2 started to spike drop down to Gonal 112.5 or 75 to hopefully allow more follicles to develop mature eggs over a 10-12 day stim vs. 8 days previously.\n\n*So how to I convince my RE to do low-and-slow vs. powering through to OHSS? Can I force them to let the embryos develop to D5, then freeze any blasts right away, fully knowing that none may develop? In that sense, who owns and controls the embryos: me, the lab, or the RE?*  Switching REs now is not possible because I'm starting my Lupron for IVF #2 on Thursday.

(sorry girls, I get the bitters, forgive me)\n\n* From what I've read, depending how long I've had that endometrioma, this could be mostly to blame for my premature ovarian aging. \n\n* I'm running out of time. It sucks, but I am.\n\n* I respond very well to the smallest dose of Clomid. I always make 2 plump follicles and 2 dumpy ones. This makes me think I'd be a good responder to stims. Right? That's good logic, right?\n\n\nOur first IUI (which failed on Christmas Day, yay for us) I had 2 follicles and fifty-fucking-four million sperm. Nothing, not even a chemical. Y'all, the stars could not have been more aligned. If I can't get pregnant in that situation, y'all think it's time to move on?\n\nI'm having to sit January out with no treatment while I switch RE's and wait for a new consult. We'll just have to weigh our odds. I mean, a 25% chance with IUI is good. I'd do that. But a 15% chance with IUI or a 50% chance with IVF (I'm just making up numbers here) then, I'd do the IVF. Right?\n\nA few months ago, I sought out some advice/encouragement from IF babies. I ruffled some feathers over there, and a few of them ruffled mine. But, I did my best to apologize and take what was said to me to heart. The babies all come out the same. I complained about the probes and one lady said she was thankful for them, for the technology. Would you regret not choosing ART if you could? \n\nAt the time, I think I wasn't ready to give up the dream of conceiving naturally. While I don't think I'm ready to give that up now, (I mean who is, but what choice do we have) I am ready to have a baby. I can get *really* caught up in how things are *supposed to be.* I need to stop letting this control my life and future.\n\nLast night my husband confessed he'd like me to try the IVF if the IUIs don't work. He said he felt so guilty asking me to do it because he know's it'll be so hard on my physically. He said he knows it's not fair because I, as a woman, already bear the brunt of pregnancy, childbirth, a body forever changed (but so worth it!), and breast feeding. :( Tears y'all! How did *I* end up with such an amazing man?! The next generation needs more of his sweetness. We have to try harder. We have the money, we have everything we need, but I'm reluctant:\n\n* I'm scared to keep trying. A part of me just wants to stop trying now. I can't function the way I could before. I don't know how many more months I can take. Call me weaksauce, but this hurt is debilitating my life.\n\n* I'm scared we'll end up with more embryos than children we want. I'm not okay giving them away and I'm not okay throwing them away. Please don't judge me, but I wonder how God will guide our choices. We all handle these things as best we can.\n\n* I'm scared to put all of our eggs in this basket and for it to fail. IVF is a last resort (we both agree we don't want to pursue donor gametes)\n\n* I'm scared we'd have to do it many times. We could afford it, but I don't want to spend my \"youth\" in treatment. If we do IVF, where is the line? \n\n* I'm scared this could negatively impact our marriage. I have a communication/social disorder, so sometimes it's already tough.\n\nSo, as you can see, I'm scared.\n\nI don't know what my point to all of this is. Perhaps I just needed to get it out there. What would you guys do? Thank you so much for reading. Big prayers and hugs for everyone this New Year.\n\n\nEdited for formatting ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think it's time for me to shit or get off the pot.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3yo255/i_think_its_time_for_me_to_shit_or_get_off_the_pot/"}, {"author": "Baa23222", "author_created_utc": 1451168453, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_t8znd", "created_utc": 1451410482, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3yoch6/is_there_an_ideal_time_of_day_to_take_gonalf/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3yoch6", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3yoch6/is_there_an_ideal_time_of_day_to_take_gonalf/", "retrieved_on": 1454960210, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Background: I did an egg retrieval last month that yielded 5 eggs, 2 fertilized, and only 1 made it to it's transfer date but ended in a failed cycle.

The doctor said it would feel like my worst menstrual cramps, which are usually pretty bad, but I wasn't too nervous - I usually handle pain like a champ.  I have probably 15-20 hours worth of tattoos, which I would rate like a 2 on the pain scale.  I was prepared for it to be uncomfortable and less than pleasant but I imagined that, at worst, it would be slightly more painful than a pap smear, but manageable.\n\nThe nurse actually started a timer at the beginning of the procedure.  The whole thing took 17.4 seconds, and it was quite possibly the most excruciating 17 seconds of my life.  You'd think you could handle anything for 17 seconds, and yet I almost asked them to stop three separate times.  The pain made me gasp and took my breath away, brought tears to my eyes, and a few more seconds would have made me pass out.  White-hot, stabbing, unimaginable, slicing, acid pain.  I left shaking and traumatized, bleeding, nauseous, and in so much freaking pain that it brings tears to my eyes just to think about it today, and I'm not an easy crier - I haven't cried in probably a year.\n\nI had a large ovarian cyst rupture last year that landed me in urgent care.  I resisted being taken in for 12 hours because I wasn't sure if I was overreacting, and my husband finally dragged me in once I started vomiting from the pain.  I would rate that as a 9/10, and the HSG yesterday was significantly, significantly more painful than that.  I'm a little pissed that the doctor would downplay it so much - I understand that everyone reacts differently and that some people don't experience as much pain.  In my opinion, it is totally mindblowing that they would do this procedure without anesthetic. FWIW, my tubes were open and everything looked normal, with the exception of some scar tissue.\n\nNow I'm totally freaked out about the eventuality of getting pregnant and going through childbirth.  I honestly cannot imagine anything much worse than the pain I felt yesterday, and that was only 17.4 seconds.  Has anyone had both a terrible HSG and given birth?  I'm usually so unaffected by pain and able to power through anything.  I once had wrist surgery and asked to stay awake so I could watch.  The HSG has me so freaked out that I'm almost ready to give up on trying to conceive entirely.  Someone please reassure me?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My HSG was the most horrible thing ever and now I'm terrified of childbirth", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3yxwqz/my_hsg_was_the_most_horrible_thing_ever_and_now/"}]}
