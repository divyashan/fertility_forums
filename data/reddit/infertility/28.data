Seriously. \n\nLittle back story, my ex best friend and I had a falling out after my house burnt down almost 3 yrs ago. We lost everything. Worst off we lost our dogs. And it was one week before Christmas. My life legit fell apart. So my best friend was nowhere to be found when this happened. It took her 2 days to answer my text when I told her what happened!\n\n\"Oh sorry, didn't know what to say...\" \n\nHow about, \"sorry and you know all that clothes you gave me a few months ago, do you need a pair of pants?\"\n\nApparently that was \"too difficult\" for her. She didn't want to deal with me being sad. Because if everything isn't all about her, she wants nothing to do with it. \n\nA few weeks go by, we had tickets to a play (pre-fire), she texts me to say she'll sell my ticket for me. Wtf? I say no and go to the play. She all but ignores me. \n\nAnother few weeks and I invite her and 2 of my other friends who like dropped everything to be by my side over for pizza. The night isn't about her so she is a BITCH to my other friends. That was it. I went full on NC with her. \n\nSo last night, I randomly log into FB and see one of my friends has knit her something for \"the baby.\" I seriously felt like I had been kicked in the teeth and the gut. Yep, she's due in a few weeks. \n\nI had a good 10-15 minute scream and cry session where hubs TOTALLY had my back. Today I'm better bc her life has no bearings on mine.

The doctor phoned in a prescription for me, and I have an appointment with him Friday.

Part of me is a little frustrated that I'm having to fill in some of the blanks for her. She started out the call saying that she's so sorry, and that maybe \"this\" was the issue all along. So I said, \"do you mean egg quality?\" Yes.\n\nSo to recap, I started this shit journey with irregular cycles and a OBGYN who wouldn't do anything to help me. Fast forward and my RE confirms PCOS and hypothyroid. I complain about immense cramping during my period and through this sub come to realize it's probably endo. We do a lap - stage IV endo. We muddle through IUIs with me having to essentially take off every other cycle because cysts. Then I have a polyp. We finally *finally* get to IVF. I respond well and think with 19 eggs that for sure we'll get at least one blast. [And here I am with zero.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4w6ly4/ivf_1_absolute_fail/)\n\nShe wants me to do my same protocol (long lupron) again this time adding in menopur because she thinks the small amount of LH it has may help my eggs get to maturity. She also wants to wait an extra day to trigger because I had a lot of follicles in the 15mm range, and she hopes to give those a boost.\n\nI asked if this next cycle fails, if we'll be able to change anything and try again or if donor eggs are basically the next option. She said that if this cycle doesn't improve, that would be her next recommendation. I'm definitely not prepared to move there yet, but I wanted to gauge how shitty my situation is.\n\nI told my husband if this 2nd IVF fails, I want to take a 3-6 month break and eat clean, lose weight, and see if we can get some better eggs queued up. I feel like only trying one IVF protocol with a slight variation in stims isn't really trying all of our options. [I read this article](http://haveababy.com/fertility-information/ivf-authority/case-study-poor-quality-eggsembryos-in) which I know is consulting Dr. Google - but it's more about the fact that I want to exhaust all our options. Since I am a high responder I feel like we'll be jumping the gun after 2 IVF cycles to move to donor eggs. \n\nLastly, I asked her about metformin again and she said there aren't any studies on that helping egg quality. Only helping ovulation for PCOS ladies, and the reason she never put me on it before is because I'm not IR. It kind of annoys me because I know it's being studied basically as a wonderdrug for anti-aging... like why not put me on? Just to try?\n\nSo now I wait until I can get put on BCP and try again.

The first cycle without clomid I started spot bleeding every day(CD1 was the 2. feb). I wrote my GYN who had done the IUI and it also coincided with the first visit with he Hospital for IVF (22. feb.). I told the hospital about this bleeding and they did a quick twat-wanding and assured me  my uterus looked great and I should just see if the bleeding stopped by it self. No time frame was given. The answer I got from my GYN was the same via email. \"lets wait and see\"\n\nThe bleeding became less and less and often I though \"Now it has finally stopped!\" only to realise that I was still bleeding but it was staying inside my uterus long before coming out. So I was really battling if I needed to call the doctor or if everything was on track as it was getting less and less. (realisation hit around May, had a scheduled meeting in June but it was a large auditorium and 2 hours talk so completely forgot to ask at the end. July was closed for the holidays....)\n\nNow:\n\nThe hospitals RE has been closed for the summer all of July and I was in Poland all of last week. So called them up Monday morning and they wanted to see me and I got an appointment today which I have just gotten back from.\n\nShe listen to me and says, well we sure want to figure out what is wrong before we start IVF! We will do a water-scan of your uterus, claumydia test(mandatory) and a Smear as yours is over a year old. (luckily it is just before my ovulation else I would have had to wait longer!)\n\nGot up and she did:\n\n* Twat-wanding for a quick check - Everything looks perfect! Nice lining.\n* Physical check where she opened with a speculum -  hmm there is quite a bit of blood here... (damn...). I can see where it is coming from.\n* Claumydia swap after cleaning blood away\n* Smear test after cleaning again....\n* water Scan - you Uterus looks perfect, all smooth not even a tiny blemish\n\nShe explained that the bleeding is coming from the cervix is due to the \"transformation zone\" being very open so the inside of the cervix walls are exposed to the outside(vagina). She told me that normally the transformation zone are positioner so there is only a very small opening into the cervix and thereby protects the more sensitive cervix walls.\n\nThis explains the bleeding but doesn't explain why I has suddenly appeared after Clomid. Going to have to wait 10 days for lab reports on the test she took. Then she will contact me but she isn't ruling out polyps yet. She said I would probably have to go for a colposcopy for further analysis.\n\nWhat is bugging me is that she said that after 1 month of spotting these tests should have been started. No one gave me any time frame to work with, when I voiced my worry, and It had been going on for 20 days when I was at the hospital where I was told everything looked fine and to wait and see. Why wasn't I told \"If you are still spotting next cycle call us\" or something similar. When I don't get a time frame I assume it can be a while. Al I was told was to focus on loosing weight and then you know life happens and you keep getting distracted by the million other things you have to remember to ask about.\n\nUpdate: 2016-08-23 All Test Negative, going onwards to a Colposcopy, full update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4z7wfw/update_cervix_bleeding_after_clomid/)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cervix bleeding after using clomid - doctor is thinking polyp", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4wvhks/cervix_bleeding_after_using_clomid_doctor_is/"}, {"author": "Feetos", "author_created_utc": 1311122886, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "38, TTC >5 yrs, 4 IUIs, MC 5/21/16, MFI-motility", "author_fullname": "t2_5jfk5", "created_utc": 1470761007, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1470800619, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4wx4sm/ugh_with_the_complaints/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4wx4sm", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 34, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4wx4sm/ugh_with_the_complaints/", "retrieved_on": 1473031278, "score": 28, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I ran to get my hair cut this morning before work.

Even though I had a \"perfect\" 22mm follicle on CD16, there were some other mishaps during the cycle (I somehow managed to lose my last femara pill and I was in Africa attending my sister's wedding at the time so I only took it for 4 days, and on the morning of the IUI we lost the majority of our sample due to me holding the cup at the wrong angle... but I digress). This cycle I was determined that everything was going to go right. I had my CD12 ultrasound on Monday 8/8 and that was a little disappointing, only one follicle \"committed to growth\" at 14.4mm but I remained super optimistic.  Things are going to go right this cycle, they have to, last time was just beginners bad luck. Last night, I come home from work &amp; open up the fridge to get something out for dinner and notice that it is unusually warm... Long story short, our newish refrigerator (purchased it in 2012) is broken. Thinking that I will be triggering the next day I panic about my Ovidrel having sat in a non-working refrigerator all day, and immediately get on the phone with the pharmacy, all thoughts of dinner vanished. Thankfully the pharmacist assures me that as long as I use the meds in the next 30 days there is no need to worry about them coming up to room temp, and I am reassured. In my mind it's another blow to my hopes of a perfect cycle, but I can handle it. This morning I go into the RE for CD14 ultrasound - the same CD last cycle where I was informed of my perfect follicle and told to trigger that evening. There is a new sonographer who I have never seen before doing my ultrasound, but I am not worried because I am going to have another perfect follicle. She then proceeds to jab me in the vag for almost 20 minutes without ever getting a clear image of my left ovary (where the growing follicle was located 2 days ago), requests that I press on my stomach, and when I complain that this whole procedure is very painful tells me \"I'm sorry honey, but if I don't push I won't be able to see anything\". I'm no ultrasound tech, but I've never had an issue with any of my other numerous ultrasounds, the first of which was at age 15 when I was still a virgin and received my PCOS diagnosis. My ovaries are very PCOS-y so I can always see them in all their polka dotted glory pretty clearly. This time I felt like she was pressing the wand so far inside of me that I might split open, all the while taking measurements of what looks to me like arbitrary lines of static on the screen. When she decides we are done she tells me that she couldn't find anything bigger then 12mm and I'll just have to come back in another 2 days. I am fuming... I don't want to blame her but at the same time I've never felt like this after an ultrasound. The pain was almost as bad as my HSG, and that is saying something. Instead of going to work like I should have post wanding I headed straight back home to complain to my husband and so he could hold me while I cried. Now that I'm done being sad &amp; pissed, I'm just full of questions. Is it possible for a growing follicle to shrink after 2 days? Was it not really there on Monday in the first place? Do I have any hope for a decent sized follicle on Friday? Will I walk into the room and see the same lady and have a panic attack? Who knows...

And they didn't even have the decency to apologize to me. \n\nI called them on Friday to tell them that my period had started because I needed a baseline ultrasound before CD6, but they are only open until noon on Friday and you have to leave a message for start of menses, so, of course, I didn't get a call back. They waited until 3 o-fucking-clock to call me on Monday when they close at 4. Unfortunately I missed the call. I called back and got a live person for once but the nurse had already left. I had talked to the Dr. Friday and he told me  not to worry about the ultrasound, so I told them to just call me back in the morning to tell me about medicine and all that. Tuesday morning they called me at 9 but, again I missed the call because I'm a teacher and it was opening day and I was in a meeting. I called back at 9:45, was put on hold for 20 minutes and then told the nurse would call me back in just a little bit. I waited for an hour and a half and then called back and was put on hold for a half a fucking hour when the fucking nurse finally picked up the phone. All of that to tell me I couldn't start the meds unless I had an ultrasound. She said the doctor didn't know/realize who he was talking to on Friday and that it would be a bad idea to start the meds without the ultrasound.\n\nSo I'm basically between a rock and a hard place. There's no way I can get to the clinic before they close and my gyno is booked solid except for 1:30 the next day (today) which I absolutely can't do (first day of school). So I call the RE's nurse back and leave a message telling them this and just how angry and displeased I am (I was not nice). She calls me back at 3:15 and basically gives me every excuse in the book as to why this isn't their fault. And here's the kicker... If they had called me earlier on Monday instead of waiting until fucking 3pm I COULD HAVE COME IN FOR THE ULTRASOUND THAT DAY. \n\nI am absolutely livid. Because of them, I'm stuck waiting another month. Because of them I get to live this fresh hell that much longer. Because of them I have basically no hope this month. I mean, we can try on our own but since I don't fucking ovulate, it's pretty well a lost cause. \n\nI am done with them. Completely 100% done. I'll be calling around to other clinics in nearby cities to see if I can get in with someone else. They dropped the ball so so hard on this. My husband was absolutely furious too and my dad was ready to come down here and yell at some people and kick asses.

She showed us our embryo ratings for each day and how they were all pretty behind from the start. She said it will worry her if we end up with a similar result in the end because obviously with 19 follicles, we should have ended up with *something*.\n\nWithout my provocation, she said she'd like to switch me to an antagonist protocol. She's worried about the lupron trigger for me with PCOS (as sometimes that doesn't cause a surge), so we'll have Ovidrel as a backup the next day if the bloodwork doesn't show I have an LH surge the morning after. She wants to keep me on a pretty low FSH protocol - 150 a day but it will be split between gonal-f and menopur which she is hoping the LH in menopur will be the secret to the crap results that happened last time and get my eggs to their proper maturity. I asked why we wouldn't bump up the FSH to try to get more eggs, and she said that more isn't always better, and that could just give us more immature follicles rather than get any of them to maturity. She's going to have me wait to trigger until my lead follicles are at 23mm instead of 21mm, as well.\n\nKnowing that this is synching up pretty well with what my 2nd opinion RE said yesterday, I'm feeling a lot more confident now about staying with my original RE. The 2nd RE cycles everyone together and had the FSH amounts even printed on the calendar sheet, which made me hesitate a little when I was reviewing everything last night. I'm sure he would have adjusted according to my response, but it just was a bit odd to see that they're giving everyone the same calendar and protocol from the start.\n\nI am glad my original RE is keeping it real with us that there may be an egg quality issue that is causing this problem, but we're also trying something different so that we can pinpoint if it was the protocol that was the problem or if it's me.\n\nBest of all - she's not making me wait to start stimming until I return from vacation. She's having me bring my meds with me and start 3 days before we return so she'll do my first monitoring the day after. That makes it so we're not getting retrieval pushed out into October - we should be somewhere in the final week of September.\n\nThis is the first day since last Thursday that I haven't felt totally broken, so that's good.

I'm not sure if I belong here yet--my husband and I have been trying 17 cycles now with nothing, not even a glimmer of a slightly-late period. \n\nComplications: My husband is military and was gone for 3 months, but even subtracting that we're still at 14 months. We've also just moved, and while we're in Canada (thanks, OHIP), we've moved to a rural area with a SEVERE shortage of doctors and people wait for months or years to be assigned to a family doctor. What I'll have to end up doing is probably going to the emergency room (our substitute for a walk-in clinic) and getting a referral to the \"local\" fertility clinic--170km away. My husband is going for his initial doctor's appointment next week, and I'm really dreading that I'm going to have to bite the bullet and go sit for hours and hours waiting for a damn referral. (I actually went for a referral appointment at my last doctor in May and it lasted 30 seconds--the doctor asked \"So, you've been trying for a year? Well, just relax, sometimes it takes a while. I'm going to refer you to an OB, but it'll probably take 3-4 months for them to see you. Have a great day!\" Thanks. Useful. And no, I didn't get in there before we moved.)\n\nIt really seems that EVERYONE I know is either pregnant, or happily childfree and wondering why anyone would ever want to have kids. My friends keep teasing me all \"Isn't it your turn soon?\" and \"Your baby's going to be so adorable!\" and it kills me to listen to it. The alternative is listening to the people I know with kids bitch about it--\"Ugh, I wish it had taken me more than a month to get pregnant, it would have been so much fun to try!\" or \"We didn't even WANT to get pregnant--want ours?\" or \"Hahaha, my husband just needs to look at me funny!\" Fuck all of them. \n\nI'm so glad this subreddit exists, it's validating everything that I've felt. There's so much pressure on us from both sets of parents--I'm an only child and my dad has a terminal cancer diagnosis, and my husband has only one brother who is, to put it very mildly, nowhere close to having kids. So I'm very glad that I have somewhere to complain and complain and complain without outing myself to my friends and/or family.\n\nSo hello all and thanks for creating such a good place :)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New here, unfortunately", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4xb2fz/new_here_unfortunately/"}, {"author": "tabitha_wexler", "author_created_utc": 1463703156, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "36, PCO + MFI = FML. 2 IUI fails.

I know we all just want the best chance at having a baby, so I'm just wondering exactly who chooses that number.\n- also, does anyone know if I were to switch to another company that also offers infertility coverage would my cycle under this insurance affect a new insurance?\n\nThank you for getting through this long mess of a post.
