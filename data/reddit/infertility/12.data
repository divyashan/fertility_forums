I don't know which other sub to post this in since I don't think other subs know as much about REs and monitoring. \n\nI'm 42. 6 failed IUIs, 6 losses. My AMH last year was .4.  I've been treated by 3 REs, consulted with another 2.  Husband and I have given up.  I stopped tracking. \n\nI think I know a thing or two about monitoring. \n\nLast week, I had a BFP. My reaction was well fuck, here we go again with another chemical/blighted ovum/etc.  My latest chemical was last month.  I ovulate crap eggs. My RE even agreed with this after another MC last year. \n\nHusband convinced me to get a beta. At ~15DPO the beta was 1001. Yesterday's beta at ~19DPO dropped to 876. Yup, here we fucking go again. \n\nMy RE posts labs on a patient portal. After posting the latest labs, a nurse sent a message saying \"Dr W reviewed your labs and u/s and **everything looks good**\" (bold added by me). **wtf**?? So I called the clinic asking why THE F*CK would they say everything \"looks good\" when my HCG took a nose dive?? [here is a screenshot](http://imgur.com/iFVszqa)\n\nThey put me on hold for a very long time. \n\nWhen the nurse came back, she was super cheerful and proceeded to feed me some serious bullsh*t. \n\nYou see, she said, it's good because the gestational sac grew over the past 4 days and **that is actually more important than HCG.** WTF??? I asked her to repeat herself. Bitch was trying to convince me that an empty sac is more fucking important than falling HCG levels **before seeing a hb**. I asked her sarcastically, \"oh so you've seen successful births after such a big drop in HCG at 4 weeks?\" Bitch says, \"oh, absolutely. In fact, Dr W wants to see you again Friday to confirm.\"\n\nLiar. \n\nBitch is covering her ass for sending a portal message saying everything looked good. We're always, always told that betas are the measuring stick for viability before seeing a heartbeat.  When I had a blighted ovum last year, **this same fcking nurse** told me there was no hope because even though the sac was growing, my HCG was falling so I should prepare for a mc. \n\nDon't worry, I have no illusions of hope. I know better.  I'm just so pissed off that this nurse is trying to cover her ass by spouting this BS.  How do you do that to IF patients?? \n\nI've been stewing over this since last night.  \n  \n**Update**:   \nI called this clinic this morning and talked to another nurse.  This nurse said, \"uhhhh, I don't know why should would tell you that....\".   She pulled up my chart and said that yes......**regardless of what any ultrasound looks like, the way my beta fell means miscarriage.**   I was like **THANK YOU** for the honesty.  It sounds f*cked up, but at least the past miscarriages and dismal betas have made me numb to these kinds of results.  I just hope this nurse isn't pulling this sh*t with other women just starting their IF journey.  \n  \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "RE clinic f*cked up &amp; now spouting god awful BS about HSG levels to cover their ass.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3k8bhb/re_clinic_fcked_up_now_spouting_god_awful_bs/"}, {"author": "StrangeLittleBeing", "author_created_utc": 1349305989, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "PCOS/Secondary IF- 5 Clomid Cycles/TI. 3 Years TTC.", "author_fullname": "t2_979mo", "created_utc": 1441810015, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1441886468, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3k8yn9/a_mix_up_in_hsg_scheduling_gah/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3k8yn9", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3k8yn9/a_mix_up_in_hsg_scheduling_gah/", "retrieved_on": 1450808586, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I got to the hospital to do my HSG today, and after waiting for about 20 minutes I got a call from OB's nurse.

It was negative (surprise). The nurse apologized profusely and at this point I was failing miserably to hold back tears.

I don't really feel like the RE I am seeing is communicating well with me and today I wasn't sure if I should be thinking of interventions or if she was just trying to sell me on them without good reason. (this RE is filling in for my regular RE who I have never met)\n\nI had my follow up RE appointment today, the first after my tubal cannulation/recanulization 2 weeks ago. I am not sure what I was expecting, but for some reason coming out of the appointment I ended up sitting on the sidewalk behind a building near my office and sobbing for 20 minutes. I know that I am not nearly as far down the rabbit hole as many people who struggle with infertility, but I am just struggling a lot with how much feels totally unknown and out of my control. I feel like I have no idea what my body is doing or why and I feel like I am not getting any answers.\n\nThe cannulation procedure successfully cleared my tube, but my RE didn't seem too celebratory. She said my AMH results are 2.19, which was good but not great for a 32 year old. \n\nShe suggested that since I have had one working tube for the last year and my husband has no MFI issues that I still should have had a good chance to get pregnant over the last year and since I am still not pregnant, if I want I can try clomid or femera, which would increase my chances of pregnancy by about 10% but would increase the chance of twins or multiples by to 8%. \n\nShe then said that given my age (32) if I want to get pregnant more quickly I can go straight to IVF and then I can also freeze embryos for later as well. I don't really know why she said that on my second visit and without really going over much with me? It looks like I ovulate successfully, my follicle count (non-medicated) on CD5 was 12 right side and 11 left side. My uterine lining was measured today (CD21/8DPO) and she said it was about \"9\" which is good. This is all without medications so it seems like I am doing okay without clomid or femera doesn't it? She said medications would just increase the amount of follicles I get. I don't know if that would be worth the risk of multiples if I have good ovulation on my own? And if I ovulate and we have no MFI, does this mean I fall in the the \"unexplained\" category?\n\nMy progesterone at 8 DPO two cycles ago was 5.1 nMol (I am canadian). She said that proves ovulation and wouldn't really give me an answer when I asked if that was enough to implant/sustain a pregnancy. \nWhen I specifically asked that today she said \"I know, your really worried about progesterone for some reason\" and left it at that. (this was during an ultrasound). Then I dropped the subject because we saw a large cyst covering my left ovary which wasn't there 2 weeks ago. She said it could just be from ovulation or it could be a cyst so I have to go back in 3 weeks to have another ultrasound to see if it is shrinking or has gone away.\n\nI don't really know what to think. I feel like I am getting no answers and I feel like it was weird that she suggested IVF to me without really giving me any strong reason why that would be a good fit for me. The RE that she is seeing patients for won't be available for appointments until October so I am not sure what to do. I am seeing her again on Sep 28 for the cyst follow up and I had another progesterone draw today to see if I ovulated this month. Is there information I should be getting that I am not asking for? Should I dive in to medications if I am ovulating normally or is that not really going to be beneficial for me if I have no ovulation issues? I am so confused and frustrated and I just don't know where to go from here.\n\nthanks for listening everyone.

As with everything that I seem to write, it's long. Sorry!\n\nI should preface this by saying that I'm no stranger to headaches or migraines. I've pretty much lived with a 24/7 headache for the last 3 years, and have had migraines for the last 11. I knew when I started the IVF process that \"headaches\" were common, and assumed that I would probably get the short end of the stick and get more than a headache. Up until last night, however, I had NO idea that they came in ultra maximum mode. I've never been in so much pain in my life, and I am 99% sure that I now know what it would be like to give birth out of my eye sockets. I ended up at the ER. \n\nToday, as usual, I went to the RE's office to get my daily dose of ultrasound, blood work, and their delicious kettle corn that's complimentary. I asked the nurse what I could be prescribed so that instead of having to wait for it to be bad enough to go to the ER I could just try to head it off at the pass at home, and she told me nothing. That I just need to go back to the emergency room whenever it gets that bad. That's all fine and dandy, but I nor my husband can really handle another midnight run to the hospital (why do these always seem to happen at night BTW??) and I really can't afford a $100 hospital bill every few days, assuming that this goes the way I'm thinking it might.... So that's my little vent.\n\nThe question is: are any of you unfortunate enough to be going through this also? Have you been prescribed anything? I suggested tylenol 3 because I know at least that can be taken right now, but the nurse poo poo'd it and said it wouldn't help. I'm planning on asking to talk to the doctor tomorrow while I'm at the office, but in the meantime I'd love some crowdsourcing! \n\nJust in case it matters I've been on 150 menopur, and 150mg Gonal-F. Tomorrow morning I start the Ganirelix, and I'm getting a bit afraid of what the outcome will be. \n\nThanks for reading my novel. Sorry again it's so long.

Things went OK. I really like my doctor, and she explained everything in a way that was very easy to follow. That first visit was only a \"get to know you\" visit, though. We made a general plan of action and she sent me on my way.\n\nSo, the plan as of now is to wait until I get my period, go in for CD3 blood work, and then start my first round of femara. She said we'd keep trying with the femara for a maximum of 6 months before moving on to more aggressive treatments. In the meantime, I'm supposed to visit a geneticist, since my husband has hereditary spherocytosis and she wants us to consult with someone who can tell us what to expect with that. \n\nSo, I'm just sitting her twiddling my thumbs, unsure of when my period will start, feeling generally useless. I don't think I've ovulated this cycle (I'm on cycle day 25 and no sign of anything, although I haven't been temping or anything for this cycle, so who knows?) Also, I work in a building full of pregnant women of all stages, and it affects me in such a bizarre way. It's like, I'm not sad exactly, but I just feel emotionally drained before I even start my shift. \n\nSometimes I feel a little burst of excitement, like, \"Hey! 6 months! I might have a little bean in 6 months time!\" But other times I feel like it's a chore to muster up the energy to even care. I don't even feel like I'm trying anymore. My sex drive has quite frankly plummeted, which is troubling because I have an extremely high sex drive normally (any advice on this would be awesome, btw). I just feel...depressed? I don't know. It's definitely a feeling I'm not accustomed to, and I'm not digging it.\n\nOne last little blurb of randomness before I go. I think my husband is genuinely disappointed that I can't get pregnant for the first time since we started all this. He's such a laid back guy, and up until now he's taken the \"It'll happen when it happens\" approach. No worry, no stress. I was fine with that, because that's just his personality through and through. But yesterday he off-handedly mentioned that his buddy on the ship found out his wife is pregnant, and he had this look on his face...I can't even describe it, really. It wasn't sadness, exactly, but kind of like a disappointed half-frown. It was really quick, and I'm sure he didn't even realize he was doing it, but I can't get that look out of my head now. For the first time I feel like I'm failing him and not just myself. Bleh.\n\nWell, this got a little long, so I'll cut myself off here. Thanks for reading if you got this far.

He called my brother who is visiting and told him to call an ambulance because he suspected internal bleeding. A fire truck showed up in my quiet little neighborhood followed by an ambulance. What a fun show that was.. So I was in the ER and the pain kept rising further up my chest and eventually it was in my right shoulder and ribs. Every time I took a breath it hurt to the point I had a panic attack and could not breathe and my husband had to run and get a nurse saying \"my wife can't breathe- SHE CANT BREATHE!\" It was awful. They gave me a shot of dilaudid in my IV which took the pain to a bearable level so I could breathe again. After 8 hours of labs and tests they could not find any reason for the pain or sickness or low blood pressure (hovered at 99/66). \n\nWell I go home with Percocet and I continue my Lupron shots and an hour ago I google \"adverse reactions to Lupron\" and lo and behold- everything I went through is listed.

After about 18 months we finally decided to move forward with Testicular Micro-dissection surgery to try to see if there were any sperm that could be extracted for IVF.  Since if they found sperm they would not want to freeze them, risk of damage, we would need to be ready to fertilize my wife's eggs right away.  This meant that we had to be ready with donor sperm in case I no sperm could be extracted.  We picked the donor, very weird process to have to go through, and were all set.  My surgery was unsuccessful and to be honest pretty painful.  \nOk so here is the thing though, and actually why I am posting this, its ok.  I actually feel better than I have in years.  The weight is off my back and I am so excited to start my family with my wife.  I want anyone who is in the early stages of dealing with infertility to know that even in a very expensive, painful, long, disappointing, and fruitless situation as mine has been the result is not the hardest part.  Getting through it will likely be exhausting but hang in there because there is an end to this time in your life, hang in there.\n\nMy wife is being implanted on Tuesday and I know this isn't the end of the road for our battle to have a baby.  I just mean that my fight to find my own fertility is over and i tried everything that was available, and that is a good feeling.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for their kind words and support!

Only, I can't get pregnant. I have PCOS, which doesn't help, but I'm very much convinced that my past is playing a part in my infertility. While I was battling my ED I would go long stretches of time with no period at all, which surely can't be a coincidence. Now I can't manage to ovulate on my own at all.\n\nI'm wracked with guilt and self doubt right now. I don't even know who to turn to. Should I mention this all to my RE?

We've had two not-well-timed cycles so I really only count two of the cycles. And our sex life has not been very active at all the past year due to my husband's illness. \n\nMy husband has been sick for quite a while with ulcerative colitis. He's not completely in remission but he's doing a lot better lately. He's on some pretty heavy drugs so since we weren't getting pregnant very easily, we had an SA done. We only got preliminary results over the phone, but the doctor did mention one of the only abnormalities was sperm \"agglutination\" or \"clumping\". We weren't told anything extensive over the phone and I don't even know to what degree they're clumping or if they're all clumped or if it's just a small percentage.\n\nThe more research I do, the more worried I am about our chances of conceiving naturally are. I'm downright terrified to be honest. It can be caused by infection or by sperm antibodies (which is bad and very difficult to treat from what I understand). Some websites say high doses of Vitamin C will fix it. Some say the only solution is ICSI/IVF. \n\nMy question is - have any of you heard of this or experienced it yourselves?

I posted here (under my old username, which has since been deleted, so I can't find the post) quite a few months ago asking if I \"belong\" here... \n\nDue to illness when I was younger, I had to get endometrial ablation and Essure, and I wasn't sure if *that* kind of infertility was okay to post about here.\n\nI was welcome with open arms, and I thank you all for that.  Good points were brought up that just because my infertility was a \"choice\" (though I hesitate to call it that, since it was either doing that or being bedridden and getting blood transfusions and intravenous iron for the rest of my life) doesn't mean I won't be having the same emotions and similar struggles to someone who is suffering from infertility for myriad other reasons.\n\nAnd then I dropped off the face of the /r/infertility earth because nothing was really going on with that.  Then I turned 30 and figured I needed to at least get my ducks in a row if I want to pursue something in the near future.  I'm not ready for a baby quite yet (I'm in school to switch careers) but I didn't want to wait until the point when I want to try and then suddenly find out all my ideas about possibilities were pipe-dreams.\n\nI emailed a few clinics and I had one doctor tell me flat-out (over email, without seeing me) that it was impossible for me to carry my own baby and I need to find a surrogate or adopt.  He also said that there is no way to remove Essure coils, and it's completely irreversible (I was not looking to reverse it because it doesn't have a high success rate, but I found about 7 doctors in the United States the *do* provide that service, so it made me question how up-to-date he was about things).  Needless to say, I didn't go with that doctor, but I was feeling pretty pessimistic about m possibilities.\n\nWell, I had my first appointment at a clinic on Friday and I discussed with the doctor my history.  He told met that it is becoming more common for women who have had endometrial ablation and even Essure to come in seeking services.\n\nThe following stuff I talk about might be something that everyone gets done, but really I'm just starting out so I don't know if this is like \"Well duh\" or something different due to my circumstance.\n\nWhat needs to be done to determine whether or not I can carry is an ultrasound of my uterus to see how thick the lining is (we had concluded that my lining had grown back after the ablation because I have regular clotting during periods) and then another thing (I can't remember what it's called, but it's another camera that enters through the cervix and looks at the uterus at a different angle) to determine whether the Essure has caused any adhesions that would make it more difficult for an egg to implant.\n\nWhen all that is finished, they'll test my egg quality, and then we can proceed from there. They'll also test my partner's semen, too.\n\nAnyway, he told me that ideally, mid-cycle the uterine lining is 10mm.  I'm pretty much right mid-cycle, and he did the ultrasound and we found that my lining is 8.6mm.  He said that is really great, and if I hadn't shared my history with him, he'd be none-the-wiser about my ablation.\n\nWe're not out of the woods yet, but I was so relieved. (And at the same time annoyed because it probably means I will suffer the issues I suffered when I was younger again at some point).\n\nWe have to wait til a different part of my cycle to do the other steps but this was a huge weight off my shoulders.  My insurance doesn't cover infertility treatments, so we are going to have to start saving money now....\n\nThen I came home and cried and cried about everything (happiness and sadness and feeling overwhelmed)... I'm so new to all this and there's so much I don't understand (because I thought for so long it wouldn't be a possibility) but I am tentatively excited about the future.\n\nI haven't delved too far into all the posts here to see if griping about my mother is appropriate, so I'll hold off on that until I've looked around more...\n\nThis is the only place where I can talk about this kind of stuff, so I'm really thankful for this community, and you'll be seeing more of me...", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Was here a few months ago...

Longtime IF sufferer but just discovered this sub the other day.  After almost 5 years of starts and stops, we're finally starting our first IVF next month!  One of the conflicts I've had over the years is deciding when do I request that my husband come to the doctor's office with me?  He's really uncomfortable there, so I've been going to most appointments on my own.  He's been there for the first consultation, the first IUI attempt, and my  hysteroscopy.  And he was there by himself today for his bloodwork.  Of course I've told him he has to be there for the retrieval and the transfer.  Should I ask him to come to the hydrosonogram?  I think I had one a few years ago, and he didn't come, but this time he does have the day off anyway.  What about some of the other scans along the way?  I'm just curious how the rest of you handle the process with your partners.  \n\nAnd what about your moms?  My mom is an old acquaintance with my RE, so I swear she'd be there for every little thing just to chat if I didn't just not tell her ahead of time!\n\nUPDATE:  I asked him to come to the scan today and he sweetly woke up a little early after the night shift.  (Of course he wore a Boba Fett t-shirt and shorts like such a grown-up, but okay, whatever).  I'm glad he was there today because it didn't go very well.

My RE decided to do a cyst aspiration instead of waiting, which I was thrilled with. I went in Wednesday at 11am and the procedure was quick and painful, but very manageable. I leave happy and satisfied that we got that shit done. I go home, take a nap to sleep off the Percocet, and wake up feeling pressure in my lower abdomen. I go to the toilet and have lots of diarrhea and then I had to grab the trash can to throw up in while on the toilet. I call my dad because it's awfully suspicious after the procedure and seems like internal bleeding symptoms. I can barely remember our conversation because I passed out in the middle of it- on the toilet. He calls my brother who is visiting and tells him to call an ambulance immediately no matter how much I protest.     \n    \nI arrive at the ER and I have a 90/66 BP with a normal heart rate but my pain has increased drastically. Within 30 minutes I feel like I'm going to rip apart if I take a deep breath and my shoulder is tremendously tight and throbbing. They tell me to stand up so they can take my heart rate. It elevates from 84 to 124 immediately and they tell me....I'm dehydrated. I'm not a medical professional of any capacity but I've heart tales from the ER from my dad (a nurse practitioner) my entire life and I just knew more was wrong, but I wait because this ED is a circus. Kids screaming, people laying in halls, women yelling- I expected animals to show up any moment.\n\nAfter the first episode of pain they gave me dilaudid because the initial 5mg Percocet did nothing. I calm down but am still in pain. my husband walks me to the bathroom because I can barely move without crying and it hurts intensely just to try to pee, but I manage. I go back to the room and five minutes later I cannot draw in a breath beyond a tortured gasp and I'm starting to freak out. I push the call button and I can't even hear the nurse but I say I'm in too much pain to breathe. Immediately after that I can't breathe anymore and I'm starting to lose consciousness. The nurse walks in, asks \"what's wrong\" and my husband tells her I can't breathe because it hurts too much. She doesn't act alarmed. Doesn't hasten her step, doesn't reassure me that I'll be okay. Doesn't say a damn thing but calls the attending and apparently got me more dilaudid which helped me breathe. Then scolds me for not calling her \"before my pain got too high.\" I'm too traumatized to reply but my husband is glaring at her with a death stare I've never seen him give before. They did an ultrasound on the four corners of my peritoneum- NOT where I had a needle jabbed into my abdominal cavity- and say they don't see blood pooling so I'm not bleeding. Discharged me with 11 Percocet a few hours later. \n\n    Today I saw a different RE for my first follicle check (lots of follicles growing- one even at 9mm on day 4) but he could not count them because **my abdomen was absolutely FULL of blood** and it hurt so much just for him to look. He thought I had a giant endometrioma because there was so much obvious blood but then he saw that it was bilateral and covering my entire uterus area (don't know the word for this) and both ovaries and I told him \"I *knew* it!\" So I recount what happened to him and he's concerned and orders a hemoglobin test. I tell him I'm feeling twice as good as I was yesterday and four times better than Saturday and he says the blood must be getting reabsorbed so we don't have to do surgery and blow the whole cycle.  I just got a call while I was typing saying my hemoglobin was normal- so WOOHOO. \n\n    My dad, a 26 year veteran of the ER, is appalled at how they missed every single symptom and discharged me with internal bleeding. He's insisting I write the newspapers- lol. But I'll probably write someone. \n\n    I feel like what happened to /u/your_what_hurts is going to happen to me at the egg retrieval. I'm wondering how in the world they can prevent it.\n\nEDIT: formatting weirdness I can't fix.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cyst Aspiration Update #4: it was internal bleeding.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3ky30r/cyst_aspiration_update_4_it_was_internal_bleeding/"}, {"author": "mwbysw", "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "1.5 yrs ", "created_utc": 1442261081, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3kyahk/a_little_weepy_and_distracted_today/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3kyahk", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3kyahk/a_little_weepy_and_distracted_today/", "retrieved_on": 1450796617, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Usually work is a great place for me to get away from infertility and do something I can do and do very well.

I am still new-ish in this sub and am trying to be as unobtrusive and respectful as possible as I go through the assessment/diagnostic phases here. I really don't want to be *that* guy with a million annoying questions but...I do have another one for you all.\n\nLast week the RE I saw suggested letrozole for me but I am unclear on why and whether I should give that a try. By all accounts  I do ovulate (good follicle count on ultrasound last cycle, positive opks) but my progesterone tends to be low (5.1nmol in june, 10 nmol in august) and I barely bleed at all during menstruation (seems suspiciously like breakthrough bleeding or brown spotting most months). \n\nIn reading old posts about letrozole/femera I am seeing some people refer to themselves as ovulating on their own but having \"bad\" or \"poor quality\" ovulation. Can anyone offer some clarity on what that means? I am starting to wonder if perhaps my ovulation is poor and that is why my progesterone is low. My doctor doesn't seem to treat progesterone so I am wondering if that's why they suggested femera? AMH is 2.19 if that makes a difference?\n\nThe RE I saw who suggested it was not a good communicator and didn't respond to my questions or spend much time with me. I have requested to see the other RE I am assigned to on my next visit who is more senior and also (from what I hear) has better bedside manner. \n\nThank you everyone!
