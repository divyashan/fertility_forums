We ended up going from nine fertilized eggs to two full blasts. Obviously, that's still a crap-tastic blast rate, and there's something going on with my egg quality, probably. But the blasts were apparently really nice looking, according to the embryologist and the RE that did the transfer, and it shows that my eggs are capable of getting there. (Last time, we ended up with an early blast + a morula from nine fertilized.) \n\nWe transferred one blast and froze the other. It feels so nice to have something in the freezer. We have another morula still hanging in there but I'm not holding my breath it will make it to freeze. \n\nI'm feeling really relieved -- not because I think this one, non-PGS verified blast is going to result in a baby I can take home (though man, that would be nice.) But because I feel like this gives us license to keep trying. If we had the same results as last time, I'm just not sure how many more rounds of IVF with my eggs I could justify. Obviously this wasn't a homerun, but I feel like it injects a tiny bit of hope into the process. If this round doesn't work, we'll likely break for a month (three back-to-back cycles seems ill-advised) and then launch into another fresh round, keeping the frozen one on tap for the future. If we can get another blast or more in the next round or two, I'd like to do PGS. (A decision partially inspired by some of the DOR ladies on here. It seems like the smart thing to do.)\n\nI cannot thank you guys enough for your support these last few weeks. They've truly been some of the most terrible days of my life, and it sounds creepy to say that a board full of Internet strangers got me through it but...well, it's true. I can't believe how kind and wise and funny y'all are, how you always know just the right thing to say.

When we got to the clinic (which is attached to a hospital), we only had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get in. The doctor took us into his office and spent nearly 45 minutes going over our histories, asking, questions, and giving us his thoughts. He spent more time with us in that visit than our old doctor did for the entire 4 months we were his patients. After he spoke with us and went over our options (which I'll talk about in a minute), he sent us to a small conference room and the nurse came to go over tests and other things with us that we would be having done in the coming weeks. Then the financial/benefits consultant came in and went over our benefits with us (we have none) and discussed what our options were and how much each would cost. After that we went to the lab to have some blood drawn and then paid our copay and left. All told, we were at the clinic for about 2 hours, but it was probably the most productive two hours I've ever spent at a doctor's office. I feel like we now have all the information we need and we can make informed, educated decisions about how to proceed.\n\nSo onto to diagnosis. Previously we were told that my husband's sperm count and motility were low and he was put on several different kinds of medicine to correct this. THe new doctor does not think that this was/is the case at all. My husband's SA was in March and apparently the lab that did the test has a terrible reputation for inaccurate test results. The doctor said he would trust that lab to tell if there was sperm in the sample and that was about it. We delayed any treatment of me for 2 months because of that lab's SA results and my husband was put on clomid, bromocriptine, and L-carnitine based on those results. He had a repeat SA done in June which came back significantly improved. The new doctor said April (when the meds started) to June was not enough time to see the improvements in the SA that we did (9million to 88million and 10% motility to 47%). So he doesn't think my husband ever had a MFI problem. And after doing some research about sperm production and all of that, I agree. I am just floored that our old RE didn't double check the SA to begin with.\n\nNow to me. He thinks I have PCOS, which I already knew, but he was appalled that I never had a baseline ultrasound done or an HSG or any kind of hormone panels other than Day 3 labs. My thyroid had never been checked and neither had my testosterone levels or anything else. He said those were our first steps to accurately diagnose my PCOS and to make sure that there weren't other factors causing issues with my fertility. He reviewed the treatments we had tried (one clomid cycle, one letrozole cycle) and he thought that for me clomid was probably the way to do go. We'll make a final decision next week at our follow-up once all the test results are in, but he thinks given my poor response to letrozole, clomid is the way to go. He gave us four options, Clomid with ultrasound monitoring and IUI ($1300), clomid with ultrasound monitoring and timed intercourse ($700), clomid with OPK monitoring and IUI ($400), and clomid with opk monitoring and time intercourse (cost of the clomid). We chose to do OPK moitoring and IUI. If that doesn't work, we'll do ultrasound and IUI the next month. He was very, very encouraging about our chances of conceiving this way. Our old doctor was ready to put us on injectables even though I know I ovulate with clomid. He never even gave us that option.\n\nSo anyway, overall, I'm very relieved that we switched doctors. The stress that our old doctor was putting us under just wasn't worth it and since switching we've encountered numerous other couples who had issues with our original RE. We have so much more hope than we did a few weeks ago and I really feel like this new doctor truly wants to help us and will do whatever needs to be done to help us get pregnant. And the big plus is that his practice is run out of a women's hospital, which is one of the best in the entire region.

We did both PGD and PGS, so we had a few conversations with out doctor about whether we would want to know the sex and/or pick the sex of the embryo [side note: I still find it amazing that they can do genetic testing and know this much about embryos so early]. My husband and I discussed it and decided that we didn't want to know the sex until after we knew whether or not this cycle worked (after the blood test on day 12) at least. That way, we wouldn't get our hopes up. I wanted to soften the blow for us as much as possible if it doesn't work, and I felt that knowing the sex would make the picture in my head too vivid and make the whole thing harder in the end potentially.\n\nSo on Thursday, the transfer was complete, and I was laying on the table having to pee like crazy and waiting for the 10 minute clock to be over so I could go pee. The doctor said he was leaving, but the embryologist would be in to talk to me. So a minute later she comes in, and she said that they transferred one embryo (due to having done PGS, they only transfer one), and it was an unaffected male....\n\nMALE? It took me a minute to realize it, but she just told me the sex. I mumbled something about not wanting to know that and she said something else and left. \n\n...I was in shock. I was uncomfortable, on this table with my legs up, without my husband, and I just found out the sex before I even know whether this worked. I felt like that moment of finding out has been taken away from us forever if this cycle works. If it doesn't, then it's a wash, but of course I'm hoping for this cycle to work. \nI don't know what to do...but I just know that it was not the smoothest way to start the 2ww. \n\nAfter that, I quickly told a nurse what just happened, and left very unceremoniously. When I got home, I sent my doctor a message on the portal that he no longer needed to hide it from us, but haven't heard back yet. \n\n\nThe second thing stressing me out is that my family just got into a huge blow up. Luckily, I am not a part of the actual blow up, but everyone is miserable, and I am getting some of the residual anger. I know I have to remove myself from the situation for the sake of my potential future family, but I'm worried that will make things worse. This is the most important thing to me right now, but how do I turn my brain off and tell it to stop worrying about all of this?\n\nAny advice, especially about the first issue, would be greatly appreciated. Has anyone else ever found out the sex before the 2ww is over and/or before you wanted to?

I am 38 years old and my husband and I have TTC for about 4 years. I have been off birth control for close to 10 years, but we weren't actively TTC until about 4 years ago. \n\nIn early 2014 my gyno did a bunch of tests to see why I wasn't getting pregnant and she found out that I had a couple polyps in my uterus. She told me this could be the reason why I wasn't getting pregnant so I ended up getting a hysteroscopy in September 2014 to remove them. Luckily the polyps came back benign so my husband and I thought we would get pregnant shortly after that surgery. \n\nFast forward to a couple months ago and I thought that since I still wasn't getting pregnant I should see a RE at a fertility clinic near my home. He told me he wanted to do another HSG and a bunch of bloodwork. I was devastated when he told me that my uterus looked like it had been scarred from my surgery 2 years ago, and that it was tiny and misshapen. He told me I could get another surgery where they would remove the scar tissue and place a balloon in my uterus for about 10 days to hopefully prevent more scarring. \n\nI decided to think about it over the weekend and my husband and I both felt that we wanted to talk to some good friends of ours and ask if she would be willing to be a surrogate for us. Amazingly she said yes instantly and said she had even been thinking about it for the  last couple years! We have been ecstatic and we plan to tell our RE that we want to go ahead with IVF because we have a surrogate already who is willing and able to do it. (My surrogate is 29, has had 5 successful and easy pregnancies, no complications, and she had her tubes tied last year because she knew she was done having her own children).\n\nSo I guess my question is, I was wondering if my results from my Ovarian Assessment Report look ok or even good (hopefully) for us to have a successful IVF and surrogacy. Also, any additional info someone may have regarding surrogacy would be awesome.

I haven't been \"officially\" diagnosed with infertility, but I have been having a hell of a time trying to get pregnant. I've only been trying since May -- I'm at the end of my 5th cycle -- so I'm aware it's early. \n\nBut the things that are going on with my body leave me very few people who I can talk to, and I don't know anyone else in my situation, so I thought, maybe here. Again, if this isn't the place, let me know.\n\nI first went in to.my doctor in August, after my period came a week early and lasted 9 days. Looking back, I should have gone in a lot earlier. My periods had always lasted way too long (10 or 11 days even) and my cycles were pretty irregular. I just didn't notice or care until I was trying to get pregnant. \n\nMy doctor has been a freaking blessing. She didn't care that I hadn't been trying for long, she gave me an ultrasound to check for physical issues, a blood panel, and prescribed me progesterone right off the bat before my blood work had even come back. Ultrasound didn't show any issues, thank goodness, and my blood panel came back fine except for elevated blood sugar. So I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes. I cut out sugar from my diet, and took the progesterone pills and thought maybe this month. \n\nWhen my next cycle started, I was temping and taking OPKs every day and doing everything my doctor said to do to time sex. She had said \"as soon as the OPK is positive, have sex that night.\" But it never got positive. It stayed at exactly the same level of not positive for three weeks, and my temps didn't show anything either, so I went back in. \n\nShe gave me another ultrasound, confirmed I hadn't ovulated, and prescribed Metformin to help with my blood sugar levels and get my to ovulate next month. \n\nSo now I'm just waiting for my period to come, knowing there hasn't been even a chance of a baby for who knows how long, and there might not be next month either. I hope the Metformin works, but I'm terrified that it won't.

She told me the very next day, again via text. Before all this, I was going to be her maid of honor (the orthodox equivalent anyway). I asked her why. She said she didn't want to bother me or make me sad. She posted wedding pictures (again restricted me from those, but you know, we have common friends and I admit I looked). The wedding looked fairly open with other friends etc. She looked happy. She just left me out of it all. \n\nI confronted her. She admited what she did, and said that she had no idea how to talk to me, or be there for me. She didn't know how. She also said \"I wanted so badly to share all of this with you, but I never wanted, in any way to make you more sad with all my happiness\". She was honest I guess. So now she is showering me with her love, but I don't know if I want to keep her in my life or not. Probably not. Maybe I'll wait for her to give birth and then end the friendship somehow. \n\nI'm lucky to have other amazing friends. One of them struggled with infertility, and is now also going to have her baby in 3 weeks or so. I was the first to know, she shared with me everything I was comfortable to hear. I love her even more now and I already love her daughter. I'm sad for me, you know, but honestly happy for her.  \n\nSo, guys, some people here already told me that they also lost friends during their IF battle.

In the time I've been waiting to see the RE, a friend has announced a pregnancy, another friend has gone off birth control and is likely going to announce soon, and another friend has had her 4th.  I'm getting anxious and coupled with baby fever, I'm feeling like the 17th is MONTHS away.\n\nI checked with my insurance, and they said an RE visit will be treated like a specialist and applied to my deductible, which we fulfilled, and so we will only have to pay 20% for that visit and any other tests/procedures that she orders from now until January 1.  My insurance company offers coverage for testing, diagnosis and treatment of infertility, and has both a cycle number maximum (6 cycles over the lifetime) and a money maximum ($5,000 max lifetime).  No one can give me a clear explanation of what this means, and the clinic says I'll likely be better of using self pay if we need to do IVF.  She said they require 20% down, so that will be $2500, and then 12 months of payments interest free on the remainder, so like $833.  \n\nI'm really afraid of these costs.  We make decent money and have a small savings, but we also have other bills that need to be paid and another child that needs to be taken care of.  I've already gone back to work part time to help cover the cost, so that will cover $575 per month but we have to come up with another $300.  And all this for something that MIGHT not work for us.  \n\nI guess I'm just really anxious to know what the plan will be.  I know I have PCOS, and My husband doesn't have any issues at all...but apparently my PCOS comes with extra stubborn ovaries that don't want to respond to Clomid or Femara.  So I'm nervous that the RE is going to recommend injectibles and straight to IVF.  Maybe this is an irrational fear, but I've heard from an acquaintance that with her PCOS at the same practice they recommended straight IVF.

Another coworker is due just before halloween, right after my cousin, and another one is due January and specifically asked for me to be her labor nurse.\n\nAll of those girls got pregnant while I was still getting negative after negative, hoping that my ovaries would eventually do their thing and I wouldn't have to go to the RE.

Then she  did a sugar absorption test which I passed with flying colours.\n\nShe used to say \"You may not have it now but you will get it!\" (\"Mark my words!\" was unspoken).\n\nThis statement has haunted me since and is the reason I have kept coming back to the doctors to get checked for PCO(especially when my weight increased). \n\nin 2011 I was tested because I had read that you just had to fit 2 out of 5 criterias(which I did) but the doctor just did the bloodtest and said \"you do not have PCO\" so I pressed about diet and help loosing weight because surely there was something not working when I ate healthy and didn't loose weight. He asked me if I was trying to get pregnant which the answer at that point was no. \"Well until you are trying to get pregnant there is no reason to mess with a complicated diet like KISS or to send you to a PCOS expert. You are on birthcontrol and that is fine\".\n\nAfter that I just couldn't be bothered anymore. Clearly I was on my own even though someone with PCO often need help stabilizing the blood sugar. I guess this is a even bigger reason to continue with Keto and avoid all carbs.\n\nI have told so many friends and spoken to my mother about how I feel like I was borderlining and no one was able to detect it.

Most recently:\n\nTotal count - 48.8 million (20.1 million in Aug, 68 million in April)\n\nProgressive motility - 19% (9% in April)\n\nTotal motility - 26% (18% in April)\n\nMorphology - 3%\n\nSperm antibodies are POSITIVE (ugh)... I need to read up on this because I don't know enough. Please feel free to share experiences. My husband has now been taking CoQ10, l-carnitine, zinc, selenium, and vit c since our initial consult appt in July. He has ulcerative colitis and is on some pretty serious meds for that. RE isn't sure that's causing any of the low counts though. Scrotal ultrasound is negative for varicocele and he doesn't feel it's necessary to see a Urologist right now even with the antibodies.\n\nOur RE is happy enough with the numbers to try IUI. We discussed clomid vs. femara. It's a bit of a blur but I think he said for women who have low ovarian reserve, femara is better. His drug of choice would be clomid for me. BUT he also said that with our sperm the way it is, his first choice (if it were free) would be IVF because your chances of success are so much higher. However, it is a lot more invasive. He figures that IUI is worth a shot though with approx. 8 million motile sperm. His bottom line is 3 million and he won't usually do IUI less than that.\n\nI told him I was slightly concerned about the bad things I've read about clomid (mostly the emotional side effects). He said that injectables have less side effects that way, and although they are more expensive, it's a more controlled cycle. He said that if I'm not too concerned about the impact on my work life (monitoring appointments every 2 days, etc), that injectables was a good option for us. He seemed to prefer the injectables IUI route. \n\nHe quoted us about a 10% chance with clomid IUI and a 20% chance with injectables IUI. \n\nI just wanted to get some experienced opinions on this plan. Do you see any red flags? Any comments? Any suggestions or advice? Will also cross-post to r/infertilitybabies as well.

Am I being too sensitive?\n\nMy cd3 monitoring appt (for IVF/ICSI) was Wednesday. When I got there, there was another patient there with her son. He was probably a year old or so, only word he knew was mommy and he was in a stroller. The tech did my u/s while another one did the other patients bloodwork in another room. The tech finished with me first so I went back to the waiting room to wait my turn for bloodwork. They finish with the other patient and she brings the stroller back out to the waiting room. They told her to go into the u/s room and the receptionist would watch her son. So the receptionist is keeping him occupied and he seems content. Then they are ready for my bloodwork. So they do my blood and As I'm walking up the hallway back to the waiting room I can hear this kid wailing for mommy. The receptionists chair is behind a corner so she couldn't see me coming but she could hear me and she goes \"here she comes\" to the kid and he's staring at me and I just said \"nope\" And the receptionist starts laughing and goes \"wrong mommy!\" And laughs her head off. I just laughed a little and sat down to wait for my novel of consent forms to print out. At first the comment didn't bother me but I just kept thinking about it and by the time I left a few minutes later I was hurt and pissed off. I know she didn't mean it in a hurtful way but I thought it was really insensitive and rude. Wrong mommy??? I may never be a mommy!! Shouldn't she be a little more aware of how her words are going to come across??\n\nAm I being too sensitive? \n\nSide note: I told my coworkers about this situation and before I even got to the part about the comment my coworkers were all up in arms about the other patient bringing her kid with her to a place where childless women go to make it happen. One of my coworkers even said \"what is she trying to do, flaunt her kid at you?!\" Lol I love her.

My boyfriend and I have been trying to conceive a child for two years now, having sex almost every single day at least once. We started trying for a baby when I was 19, and he was 23. Yes I realize this is usually considered very young but we are financially able to raise a child, we're in love, our relationship is healthy and I've always wanted to bring children into this world early. Well, two years later and still no baby. I'd go see a fertility doctor but because our situation is so unconventional compared to the usual social standards I know a doctor will not take my infertility seriously. Being only 21 and unmarried leaves me worried that I'll have to wait a couple more years to get medical advice/help to conceive. On top of that stress, my very conservative mother is constantly telling me I look or am acting pregnant, pestering me about when I had my period last, and advising me to get back on some birth control to be precautionary and avoid an \"unwanted child\". I always tell her we use condoms and that under no circumstances am I pregnant. Little does she know I've been trying to get pregnant for years.... Little does she know how much it hurts me when she says I've gained a little pooch, and she's SOOO concerned I'm pregnant. She's even bought me pregnancy tests and left them at my doorstep because she was THAT concerned, demanded I take them and let her know the results so she can \"relieve her stress\". \n\nI know that compared to many couples fertility struggles and problems this is hardly the tip of the iceberg compared to how my situation could be... But I still feel so sad about it.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Thank you so much! I recieved only a slight amount of criticism, and it really felt like not only did many of you jump to my rescue, but everyone offered me excellent advice and encouragement. Thanks to you lovely people I have the confidence now to go see an OB and go from there. I never thought at my age I'd be taken seriously, and many of you changed that mindset for me. I can't tell you how helpful that is and what a relief it is for me. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. If I didn't reach out to you all I probably would have waited another 2 or 3 years before seeking medical help, and as we all know- time is of the essence. \n\nThank you again everybody for being so genuine AND helpful, I wish all of you the best of luck. \ud83d\udc97", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Small rant", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/54ehfo/small_rant/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1474797772, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/54ej91/sunday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "54ej91", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 230, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/54ej91/sunday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1476450101, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

I've never brought it up, which is of course my own fault, but she made a comment one time that her mentor would send people home if they didn't have their charts ready when she came in (I'm often still filling mine out when my RE comes in) which made me feel nervous about the subject.

When the doctor came out, he told me they had collected three eggs. I thought to myself \"great news, we're only transferring two embryos anyway\". Then on our way home I decided to Google around a bit, and... it seems three eggs is not, in fact, great news. Not at all. I haven't told her this yet, not even sure if I will.\n\nThey told us to call them back tomorrow, but in the mean time, I would like to ask some of the more experienced people here if, realistically, we stand a chance at all. She is 27, so age should be on our side at least. Does the fact that we're going to do ICSI make any difference? I'm thinking that, in theory at least, all three eggs should become fertilized since they are actually going to inject a sperm inside with a needle, but then again, a couple hours ago I thought three eggs was \"great news\", so in all likelihood I'm just wrong again.\n\nI've given her over twenty injections over the past two weeks, often hurting her in the process as I'm definitely no nurse, and feeling like an absolute monster because of it. I knew the chances of success were never that good to begin with, I knew that it would take quite a bit of luck to succeed on our first attempt, and I was reasonably prepared for a negative outcome after the two week wait... but I had not even considered the possibility of not having even a single embryo. It simply had not crossed my mind at all. It feels like losing before we even got a chance to play our cards.\n\nIt's going to be a very long 22 and a half hours until that phone call...\n\nEdit: thought this may be of interest to others here, I just found this 2011 study (http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/04/18/humrep.der106.full.pdf) on age, number of eggs retrieved, and live birth rate.
