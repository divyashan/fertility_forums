She has bitchy tendencies, but we've always been respectful of one another and she's expressed many times that she thinks I'm the best person her son could have married.\n\nLast week, my SIL contacted my husband about being the godfather of his niece. My husband comes from a Catholic family (as do I) but -and I hope I don't offend anyone here- we are both non-religious and non-believers. He was never had a confirmation as a Catholic, which apparently you have to do to be a godparent. His sister pressed him as to why he hasn't done it as an adult and he told her the truth. His sister and mom live together with his niece so I'm sure she told his mom this information right away last week. \n\nTuesday, we learned that we would only be able to conceive by IVF and I told his mother. She was really sweet, understanding and said she wished she had the money to help out. \n\nToday, my husband called to tell me his mother had just bitched him out for 20 minutes over the phone. Now, 7 days later, she's telling him she's upset he doesn't believe in God AND she thinks he only feels this way because I converted him to Atheism. Keep in mind, I've never been really open about my beliefs, I'm totally respectful of the people around me who are religious and I've even gone to church with her family. \n\nHe corrected her and said he'd felt this way since he was a teen but never verbalized it to her. He told her it was actually a big reason we got along so well when we lived and started dating in the Deep South. This is all really stupid because his mother isnt even really a practicing catholic. She believes in birth control, doesn't go to church except holidays, funerals, and weddings, pro-choice, gay rights, etc. His sister had this baby out of wedlock and didn't even know the father. They clearly aren't living a Catholic lifestyle so I don't know where this is even coming from.\n\nMaybe it's just really bad timing, but I really feel like this has to do with what I told her this week. Before, I was the best thing to happen to her son and now I'm the wicked devil woman who can't give her another grandchild. She reamed him out and said she didn't know why he \"Always puts her on speaker phone when I'm in the room.\" That statement is not true and idk why she suddenly has a problem with it. Yes, I'm jumping to conclusions but it's really hard not to talk all of this personally. \n\nAt the end of the convo she actually said to him, \"Maybe you aren't the best person to be her godfather.\" We own a home, have good credit, good jobs, I'm working on my second graduate degree... we are literally the most responsible people she knows and that comment was so out of line.\n\nI feel like she's thinking we don't have a baby because we are being punished by God. This has been such hard news to bear and I can't deal with this negativity. The real shit kicker is that I'm not even supposed to know this conversation took place.I don't know if I should say something to her. I just really could use some emotional support from her and I don't want there to be any animosity between us because she means so much to my husband. I've seen how she's cut some people out of her life because they pissed her off and I honestly don't know what to do.

One of my two best friends rang me earlier today and after listening to my chatter for a while, and then chatting herself for a while, just dropped a little bomb on my emotions of \"[her daughter] is going to be a big sister!\". Warning for some bad language and RAGE about to come. I fucking KNEW she was pregnant, since starting this infertility \"journey\" (said in a sneering tone of voice) I have gotten really good at picking up the subtle changes in people's behaviour and have picked up the last three pregnancies in my friendship group before they told us. At first I was just making faces and vomit signs to my husband to try to stop myself from crying while doing an Oscar worthy job of pretending that I was thrilled for her - and then there was the inevitable \"I wasn't expecting it to happen so soon\" and I was trying to cope by rolling my eyes - and then she told me she was eight weeks (the same gestational age as my miscarriage in March) and had had three episodes of bleeding but her obstetrician thought things were fine, she just has to go in to see him whenever there is a bleed - and she started complaining about how hard it is to go to the doctors when she has a toddler, and how she has to take medication every day now (my heart bleeds for her), and I couldn't help but start to cry. Luckily I kept it silent because she doesn't know we are on fertility treatments or any of our fertility problems, but I was in pain. I should emphasise heavily here that I love my friend, obviously, and her family, and there is a small tiny but genuine part of me that is actually really happy and excited for them. But today, it is completely fucking overwhelmed by all the other bits of me that are despondent and broken and rage-filled. After an interminable ten minute conversation with her (including a lovely three minutes of listening to her toddler crying while she tried to soothe her and then three more minutes of her complaining about her toddler crying), I finally managed to think of an excuse to hang up, and then went to go outside but got captured by my husband giving me a massive bear hug, and I just dissolved into tears. Then went outside for a bit to be by myself, then went and lay in the shower for half an hour going through every emotion you can have in this process - grief, guilt, despair, self-hatred, fear, etc, staring at my empty hands and belly - and finally settled on rage. I am REALLY ANGRY and I don't even know why really. This is a stupid fucking process and I hate it and I don't want to have to go through it any more and I just want it all to be over. I know there are people in far worse situations than me, including on this forum, but fuck it I am still entitled to my rage and right now I am FULL OF RAGE. AAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH. IT IS NOT FAIR!!!!

Well, my second monitoring 2 days later I had 8 follicles, all under 10 and estrogen was 90. I still wasnt happy, but I was able to keep my shit together. Third monitoring, yesterday, after 9.5 days of stims, my total count went up to 13, 3 over 10, 6 over 5 and the rest under 5, estrogen was 590. Im still not crazy about how this shit is turning out because reasons:\n\n1. I'm fucking DOR and they had me on 5 weeks of BCPs and 12 days if Lupron BEFORE EVEN STARTING STIMS! When I asked my RE why im having such a sluggish response, he said \"well that can happen with extended Lupron use in DOR patients\" OMG, then why the fuck did he have me take it that long?!\n\n2. I saw a different RE at my last monitoring (now all 5 REs at our clinic have seen my vagina, yay) and he said \"you want to start IVF with high a dose to recruit as many follicles as you can in the beginning for greatest total number of eggs at retreival\". Well, my RE had me on 300iu Gonal-f for the first 2 days, then added 75iu menopur the next 2 days. Now I'm up to 375iu Gonal-f and 150iu menopur. He had me go the opposite direction the other RE recommended and I dont know how to feel about that.\n\n3. This fucking cycle has been delayed because their newly aquired surgical center was undergoing renovations AND NO ONE FUCKING TOLD ME! I was told my egg retrieval would be tomorrow, the 28th, at the latest, now he says the 1st or the 2nd. Well shit, the moving company is supposed to be delivering our belongings on the 1st. It'll take us 3 days for us to driveto to California, so I just don't know WTF to do about that.\n\n4. My husband keeps fucking nagging me about how much more meds/monitoring I need and how much it's all going to cost. Im about ready to just tell him it'll be cheaper for him to find a new and fertile wife. Like I dont feel fucking guilty enough about being infertile, now he's a constant reminder about how much precious money my ovaries are costing him/us.\n\nI'm just so fucking angry. All of everything above may just be normal shit and how my shitty cookie crumbles, but I'm just so fucking angry. I'm channeling my anger at my husband and RE and I believe that's misguided. I just want to break my knuckles on *someone's* face!\n\nLastly, just want to say I've been swamped. I haven't been too active here, but I've been lurking when I get a few minutes to myself.

My husband had an SA done in the middle of May that showed he had slightly low sperm count, low motility, but good morphology. It also showed that he had a high white blood count, which means an infection. My doctor assured us that his problems were caused by the infection and that an antibiotic would take care of it. She also recommended seeing a urologist, but would call us with the scheduling details. After two weeks of no word, we called and left a message. We had to call 4 times (all were about w week apart) for someone to call us back. It turns out that my doctor wasn't comfortable prescribing the meds, so she set us up with another provider in her office. My husband saw that doctor today. He was told that antibiotics don't have a high success rate treating infections in the semen, but would prescribe it anyway to see what happens. I'm pissed. We have two different professional opinions regarding the antibiotics and no one can give us a straight answer. Is it going to work or not? Is this a waste of money?

On our first cycle of IVF we lost all our embryos due to attrition around day 3. Our first obgyn (not an RE) (aside from being horrible to deal with and making lots of mistakes) advised us to go straight to ED as we would never get pregnant with our own embryos.\n\nOur new RE explained it is likely due to sperm factors and it would be worthwhile trying IMSI (used ISCI last time). \n\n(For those who are interested our RE explained that embryos from fertilisation to D3 are controlled by female DNA then from D3 onwards the sperm DNA starts to play a role, so if you are find your embryos are dropping off around this time it might be sperm issues, (or a combination of egg and sperm issues because good quality eggs can make up for bad sperm)). \n\nWell last time (IVF#1) basically we got called every couple of days by the clinic to update us, and tell us that half our remaining embryos had continued to die /broken down, until we couldn't take it anymore and asked them to only call once they were all gone, which they did two days later (D4/D5), this time (IVF#2) for our own sanity we have decided to wait until ether we would know how many survived to biopsy (we are doing PGD) or how many are healthy (I.e. Cleared by PGD testing) or if they are all gone. I'm going so crazy right now with the need to know but I feel like it will be bad luck to find out (stupid right)! So I need to wait 6-7 more days to know how many have survived to biopsy (egg collection was today and I feel awful, so bloated and in so much pain!) or 5 weeks for PGD results. \n\nDoes anyone have any stories like ours, I would love to hear from anyone who has had embryos pull through on their next cycle, or succeeded with IMSI, or if you have any idea on expected attrition rates? As far as I can find we would be expecting a 50% attrition rate at each step, so if we start with 20 eggs about 10might fertilise, 5might make it to D3 and 2might make it to d5, and one might be healthy/pass PGD. Which is what we saw last time but we only started with 10, so none made it to D5. :(!\n\n The worst was that the nurses keeps telling us (this time and last) that it will work well because we are &lt;35 years old. \n\nI know you are all so amazing and many have been through so many more rounds, I just don't know how you do it, my heart is absolutely breaking right now.

My beta after my FET started out great at 199 on 9dp5dt.  The next one had a doubling time of 67 hours, which my clinic said was totally fine for an FET, that anything under 72 hours was normal.  They rechecked the hCG levels 3 days later then because I had to go in for a progesterone and estrogen check anyway, and that time my hCG only rose 17% in 3 days.  Horrible rise.  I cried a lot, we knew we were losing it, etc.  That was Friday the 17th.\n\nThey had me come back Sunday the 19th for another draw to confirm either a plateau or that it's falling... and it came back 48% higher in 2 days this time.  So a huge speed up.  Now that it had proven itself to be erratic, I was suddenly at risk for ectopic.\n\nFuck fuck fuck.\n\nThey told me they had to wait until I was 6w to confirm if it was ectopic, and seeing as how at 5w0d my hCG was only 568 and not increasing very quickly, they didn't think they'd see anything sooner.  They said to call them right away if I felt any significant or consistent pain before that next appointment. \n\nThursday the 23rd, I was feeling some twingy consistent ache for a few hours, so I called.  I figured there would be no harm, better safe than sorry.  I went in for an ultrasound, and they were able to visualize a small gestational sac in my uterus (yay no ectopic).  I was 5w4d, and it was measuring 5w1d.  Ok, well considering the weird 3 day slowdown I had, that makes sense.  They took my hCG that day, and it nearly quadrupled since Sunday!  Suddenly it seemed like maybe we had hope.  \n\nYesterday I went in for another ultrasound at 6w1d.  Even though we knew the likely outcome, we still were hoping for a miracle.  But this time the gestational sac only grew \"2 days'\" worth - from 5w1d to 5w3d, and still no yolk.  So it was then measuring 5 days behind at that point, and appeared to be slowing down.\n\nTalk about a fucking roller coaster.\n\nAnyway, they're ready to call it.  Whatever is growing in me isn't healthy at all, this herky-jerky growth isn't good and isn't going to result in a healthy viable pregnancy.  I'm waiting for the phone call this morning to get on the schedule for a D&amp;C later this week, probably Thursday.  We'll do one more ultrasound to be sure, but I'm all out of hope.  I'm so exhausted.\n\nWe're going straight for the D&amp;C so they can test the tissue in the gestational sac for genetic abnormalities.  Also because two years ago when I had a loss at a similar time (though it was a more developed gestational sac - 7w - with corresponding normal hormones, just no fetus - yay blighted ovums), I went off progesterone hoping to pass it naturally.  After 3 weeks that didn't happen, so I did cytotec/misoprostol, then had retained tissue 2 weeks later, did a second round of cytotec, that failed, and so I had to go in for a D&amp;C anyway.  Fuck all that noise, I'm going straight to D&amp;C this time.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to give you all an update since it was pregnancy related and thus I couldn't post this hell while it was happening to me.\n\nEdit: Yup, Thursday at 9:30am.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "D&amp;C later this week", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4qa1jj/dc_later_this_week/"}, {"author": "thelongbattle", "author_created_utc": 1454771388, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "ttcsince Oct 13 1 ectopic 2 mcs", "author_fullname": "t2_uhju1", "created_utc": 1467134441, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4qalbo/looks_like_i_have_more_follicles_than_previously/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4qalbo", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4qalbo/looks_like_i_have_more_follicles_than_previously/", "retrieved_on": 1472818920, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "After 4 days of stims I had my first monitoring appointment this morning, it was supposed to be tomorrow but my estradiol was higher than expected yesterday. \n\nA year ago I had approx 9 or 10 follicles, last Friday at my baseline US it was 16 or 17 and today it's 24.

Nothing about IVF.  We're both Catholic, so we're admittedly limited by what our Church practices and believes in certain regards (but if you can explain to me [the stance on homologous artificial insemination I would be grateful, because even THEY seem confused, just see article 6](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19870222_respect-for-human-life_en.html)).\n\nI'm just so angry right now and I can't calm down.  My wife just called me with the news about morphology.  \n\nShe has her own host of issues (irregular cycles, anovulatory bleeding), but really.\n\nThe aspect of faith is just fueling my anger right now. \n\nWhy are high school students more \"worthy\" to get pregnant than my wife?  Why are those who are just going to abort their children even getting pregnant when we DESIRE children?\n\nNo one freaking knows what we're going through, no one wants to talk about infertility, and all of our pregnant friends and family avoid the subject like the plague around us.\n\nWe're alone, we have no support, and I am **so sick** of people treating adoption like it's a freaking consolation prize.\n\nI'm just angry and I need to vent and this is the only place to do it.\n\n---\n\n*Edit*\n\nThank you all for your kind replies.  I really needed a place to vent because I could **not** calm down yesterday.  \n\nI do not intend to hijack the principle and goal of this sub, and I also in **no way** intend to proselytize, but I want to just offer some perspective regarding the Catholic Church.  \n\n##My disclaimer would be that, in no way, am I intending judgment on any person here, nor your children if you chose IVF.\n\nThe Catholic Church - as I am sure many of you are aware - is a gigantic, institutionalized Faith that operates throughout the world and has survived the centuries.  When one is Catholic - and by that I mean, when one *chooses* to be Catholic and has that choice \"ratified\" (so to speak) in the sacraments of baptism and confirmation - he is bound by many things within the Church.  He is bound by all of the Doctrine and Moral Law within the Church, the teachings of which can all be found in the [Catechism of the Catholic Church](http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html) (CCC).  He is also bound by the Ceremonial/Ritual Law of the Church, found in the [Code of Canon Law](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_INDEX.HTM) (CIC).\n\nI recognize that many people here may not be Catholic (and even to some Catholics) the idea of a principled set of authoritatively defined beliefs and practices is odd.\n\nBut, at my confirmation (and for the rest of my life), I made a solemn vow.  I publicly professed that *I believe and profess all that the holy Catholic Church teaches, believes and proclaims to be revealed by God.* \n\nJust as sure as my vow to my wife in marriage cannot be broken, so too can my vow before the Church not be broken.  We reaffirm this vow at every Mass and with every, \"Amen\" we say before receiving Christ in the Eucharist.\n\nPersonally, the logic is easy for me to follow: *if* Christ existed, and *if* He founded a Church, and *if* what is said in Matthew 16:13-20 is True, and *if* the historical records of the Catholic Church are sound, *then* it follows that this is the Church that has the *authority* to codify its beliefs for its members.\n\nNow, *that* is a statement of personal belief.  I don't ask you to agree with it, I don't ask that you be converted by it, but I ask that you attempt to understand my reason for being \"sold-out\" for the Catholic Church and being another \"crazy Catholic.\"\n\nSo when it comes to the Church and IVF, no the views will not change.  This is ennummerated in the Catechism, in paragraphs 2375 and following.  The teaching is repeated in the document [*Donum Vitae*](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19870222_respect-for-human-life_en.html) and continuously affirmed in local decrees, such as the commentary [*Begotten Not Made*](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/reproductive-technology/begotten-not-made-a-catholic-view-of-reproductive-technology.cfm) from the USCCB.\n\nI will not quote these at length here - **primarily because I myself am still apoplectic over them** - but suffice it to say that the Church believes that the union between man and woman is so good, so holy, so sacred that those bounds should never be violated or infringed upon through a sterile, surgical room, *even if* it means the chance at conceiving.  The Church is against IVF because of the means (removing sperm and multiple eggs and fertilizing each) and the method (choosing which embryos to implant, while leaving the others to die and removing all significance of the sexual act between husband and wife).  This poses multiple problems for the Church: [masturbation is intrinsically evil ](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2352.htm) (and though I disagree with this for scientific/medical reasons, I see the principle) and [life begins at conception](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2270.htm) (so any willful destruction of a fertilized embryo is a grave wrong).\n\nAgain - I do not ask that you believe them, nor do I ask that you are converted by them (**these are NOT arguments against you**), but that you seek to understand *why* the Church believes as She does.\n\nI realize that, because of my beliefs, I am painted into a corner here.  That, too, is part of my frustration.\n\nI just needed an opportunity to vent, to scream, to rage because I do not understand my (or my wife's) biology and I do not understand the teaching of the Church and I do not understand the will of God here.\n\nAnd, for as much as the Church *loves* to preach about families and children and the protection of unborn life, it is **surprisingly silent about the burden and the cross of infertility.** We're ignored.  Our friends do not know how to act, our priests do not know how to respond, and our family would rather not discuss the subject at all.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm just so angry", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4qbded/im_just_so_angry/"}, {"author": "notmaybemaybe", "author_created_utc": 1467141499, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_z3amn", "created_utc": 1467143516, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4qbeyh/setting_up_an_appointment_broke_me/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4qbeyh", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4qbeyh/setting_up_an_appointment_broke_me/", "retrieved_on": 1472819361, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi guys. I've been reading here for a while, but I never dared to write. Today is the day I need to change that in order to not go completely crazy. Here is the thing. Hubby has low sperm count. We had two IVF ICSI cycles, both didn't work and nobody really knows why. So we're in this limbo, not knowing what to do, not knowing if we should try again. So we decided to visit another clinic, ask what they think, and then maybe giving it another try. So today I wanted to set up an appointment. All I wanted was to get a date and a time for this new location to visit. I was prepared to say my name and date of birth, and maybe some background story. But nope, it went in a completely different direction. First thing they asked was \"where did you hear about us??\" - well, online somewhere, why do you care... I said \"internet\". They continued to ask a LOT. My name, complete address, date of birth, the whole insurance thing even though the insurance won't pay a dime anyway. They asked a ton of questions about me. Not caring about me, just caring about this stupid questionnaire. Have I been pregnant before? Well no, thanks for asking. At this point I started silently crying. Do you have illnesses? Allergies? No, hubby is the \"problem\"! Did you try IVF before? Yes, twice, thanks for rubbing that in... Did I have retrievals? Yes (crying a little more). Did I have transfers? Yes. (Crying even more). And no, they didn't work. At this point she told me they need all the information and need to know where it was and stuff like that. What? Why? I just wanted an appointment! Then they started asking about hubby. Does hubby have kids? I'm trying to sound normal while tears are flowing. No, of course he doesn't. Has his sperm been tested? What do you think how and why we did IVF twice?? Was it normal? No, for crying out loud, it was not! It's why we need ICSI! Why don't you just ask me what the problem is?? Why do they make it so hard?? Patient care? Oh no, all they care about is their stupid questionnaire. I would have been fine telling my story, but the way I got asked felt like I was being interrogated. It felt like I did something wrong. They scolded me for not having all the information ready. They really NEEEEED it before the appointment. Yeah, yeah, I get it! Now, I totally understand they need all the information they can get. I would have given it to them gladly. But at this point I don't even know if we want to go through the whole thing again. I just wanted a first appointment to talk about our options and then decide if we want to try another cycle. I really wasn't prepared for this phone call. Which is why I'm now trying to tell you here, maybe it'll help someone else who is about to make a similar call. Be prepared. I thought they know what people they are talking to, but they don't seem to care. After the call I cried loudly for several minutes. This is not what I expected. I just wanted to make an appointment. Well, I got one. But I'm really not sure I trust this clinic. But here is the thing, I'm pretty sure setting up appointments is the same in other clinics too... Maybe it was just easier when I did it the first time because I could say \"don't know\", or \"haven't tried yet\", etc. to every question... Has anyone else changed clinics between cycles?

Yesterday and today at 11 and 12 days post-embryo transfer, she had pink in her CM. Not a full flow, not even reaching the toilet paper. Her provider's office told her this could be implantation bleeding, it could be spotting that some women experience all through pregnancy, or it could be her period. She's supposed to monitor and call with changes. Her appointment for a pregnancy blood test is on Friday. \n\nShe is still devastated. There's no talking to her. She's back at work today and we chatted for just a couple minutes on gchat before she signed off. I don't know whether she couldn't cope and went home, or if she's blocked me again like she did when I was pregnant with my first child. I hope it's the former, but I am preparing for it to be the latter. \n\nI sent her a quick \"love you, thinking of you\" text a few minutes ago, and I'm going to leave it at that for now. I might send a text to her husband (we're friends) to let him know they're in my thoughts, too. He's very upset but a little less emotional about it as far as I understand from her. \n\nAs far as what the pink CM actually means at 11 &amp; 12 days post-transfer, you guys probably know better than I do. She seems to think her provider is stringing her along for false hope until they can officially call it a failure. \n\nAnyway, I really just wanted to thank you all for your support and input.

Several of us have moved on but we still do A LOT together. We started ttc when I still worked with them and I mentioned that we tried IVF recently. So, they know enough but not the details. Today, we did a girl day with mani-pedi's and lunch. The only one in the group with children asked if I had any updates. (She and I shared a bed the first night of my protocol so she got to share in on the fun). When I told her that we had to cancel the cycle, she got really upset. It was probably the most touching reaction I've had from anyone. I just told her that my body wasn't responding the way it should. She asked how much money we lost and then started crying. She apologized over and over for the tears but kept saying, \"It's not fair that such deserving people can't have this. You guys are trying everything and there's horrible people in this world having babies without any problems.\" Honestly, it was VERY touching. Everyone else just seemed to brush off the fact that our cycle was cancelled. It was nice to see someone else sympathizing with my pain.\n\nBut then... \n\nWe started talking about a mutual friend who has 5 kids! Not sure how the topic was brought up but I mentioned that I was going to have to hide her from my newsfeed. Her posts are always flashbacks to a video of her ultrasound when she found out the 4th was a girl. Or flashbacks to all the millions of pregnancy announcements she's had. And pictures of her kids with quotes like, \"Children are a gift from God.\" It's very upsetting and I can't handle it. This friend who was just crying for me says, \"Thats funny cause I had the opposite reaction. Whenever I see that I wonder if we should have more. I want to stop at 3 but my husband think we need an even number... blah. Blah. Blah.\" She had a miscarriage about a year ago and talked about how that made her want more babies. I was stunned. I think I cut her off and said something about how nice it must be to have that option cause I'd just like to get 1. That totally threw her off and she stumbled over her words after that. Ugh. I just couldn't believe that after the tears and conversation we JUST had about my infertility, she thought it was okay to discuss having more kids with me. She probably didn't think about it and I still love her but grrrr.... \n\nEDIT: So that it doesn't seem like I'm dismissing the pain and heartache of a miscarriage... She miscarried in April, got pregnant the next month and now has a healthy baby girl.

He knocked her up again. I'm not fucking kidding.\n\nI'm so fucking beside myself right now. I know I have no right to be angry but I can't help it. I'm so sick of seeing these people who don't even want kids/more kids popping out babies like they're fucking pez. On top of my fertility issues, we're also a queer couple. I am occasionally infuriated at how easy it is for straight, cisgender people to conceive (comparatively, of course, not overall) when we're FIGHTING the insurance company to cover anything fertility related. We finally upgraded our coverage so technically we're now covered for ovulation induction and artifical insemination. Cool. Except the fact that donor sperm costs $500 and up per sample, which apparently isn't covered by anyone anywhere because fuck us, I guess. Oh and even though I was (finally) diagnosed with an \"infertility diagnoses\" (PCOS) it doesn't count because I wasn't diagnosed by a gyno or RE, but by the person who serves as my GP (she's actually an NP i think, but it doesn't matter, she's fantastic and the best provider I've ever had). So they basically want me to get referred to a RE to confirm that diagnoses, and then start that \"x months of trying before we move on to fertility treatments\" bullshit all over again. I'm fucking livid. I've been diagnosed for 7 months, I've been taking the metformin that sort of helped at first and then just stopped. I've done what I was supposed to be doing and now they're still fighting me on it. \n\nI hate this. I'm so sick of it. And now I get to watch SO's family dote on the first babies of the family, which should have been ours. It's bad enough they look down on us and everything SO does just because he's transgender, now we get to deal with the fact that not only will they not be at all excited when (if) we finally have kids, but the fact that they may not even be willing to recognize those kids as SO's and as such part of their family. When no one on that side had kids yet we thought we had a chance. His sister is very young, his brother is younger than him and a fuckup. No one expected there to be any grandbabies for a long time. Now our kids don't stand a chance. It sounds so shitty, but it's true. And it breaks my fucking heart almost as much as how much we're struggling to do this. \n\nFuck this. Fuck them.

And, I have a story that i'm finally able to laugh about and thought I'd share as maybe it will help someone else laugh or at least, commiserate.\n\nWe tried for a baby for over year with no luck and 1 chemical pregnancy. 3 months of clomid, trigger shots with timed intercourse. We moved on to IUI; yesterday was my 2nd IUI (fingers crossed) it would have been number 3, BUT the first IUI attempt was botched.\n\n6am, 3 months ago.......... Husband produced a sample at home and I was to bring it to the clinic. I was not thrilled with how much of a sample was in the jar and did a REAL BAD job of hiding my disappointment (because hormones) and I'm fairly certain that when we were't trying to get pregnant, I had to clean up A LOT more semen  than was produced that fateful morning.\n\nHe was upset that I was upset and the clock was ticking, both of them, i had 45 minutes to get from one end of NY to the other for the sample to be viable... (I also spend a lot on cabs, an unexpected fertility expense) So i placed the specimen jar in a ziplock bag, put it on the inside of my jacket pocket to keep it warm and hailed a cab. While in said cab, I decided to google \"how much semen needed for IUI\" and carefully removed the jar from my jacket to inspect if what we had here was going to be sufficient.... Well neither my husband or I apparently know how to secure a lid and it was everywhere but in the jar.  I thought I could scoop it into the jar from the ziplock, pour it maybe? While crying uncontrollably, and trying to salvage what was left, we hit a bump and it wasn't pretty... though I'm sure there are worse ways to get semen in the back seat of your cab.\n\nIn the moment, i was so sad and desperate and lonely, I had to call and explain the situation to the nurse since i wasn't coming in for my appointment. Tell the cab driver my destination had changed and went straight to work with a tear streamed face.  Now however, I think it may make a good chapter in a book, or at least a story we can tell our future child of how lucky they are, if it weren't for a bump in the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel and our inability to fasten a lid, they may not be here :-)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Me, My Cabbie and a jar \"half\" full.....", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4qm4jm/me_my_cabbie_and_a_jar_half_full/"}, {"author": "firefiremyheart", "author_created_utc": 1464206492, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "DOR, RPL, FET #3 after hysteroscopy", "author_fullname": "t2_y7khs", "created_utc": 1467301936, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4qmdwo/the_infertiles_dilemma/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4qmdwo", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4qmdwo/the_infertiles_dilemma/", "retrieved_on": 1472829681, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "On a \"break\" month after a failed FET.

The simple explanation is that she has always favored my Aunt, and now also favors my cousins as well. Over the years she has abused me too much emotionally to want to continue to engage with her. She would deliberately create lies to try and wedge my cousins and I apart, and would do the same between my Aunt and my Mom. Trust me when I say that she acts with the emotional intelligence of an impulsive child. Whenever I have tried to communicate about how she has made me feel, she would blow up with complete hostility, tell me she was 'done' with me, or my personal favorite - tell blatant lies to my family to recruit them to her side. \n\n\nWhen I had my ectopic/salpingectomy in 2013, it took 8 weeks for my hCG to go down enough for me to get my first period. After that 8 weeks, I got my first (horrible) period the day before we had a family dinner scheduled for my Mom's birthday. Everyone present knew what had happened to us, and gave us all those really sad, weak smiles. We had not been seated for 10 minutes, and that's when my Nana took it upon herself to announce my second-cousins pregnancy at the table. That cousin was NOT EVEN PRESENT. There was absolutely no reason to announce it, but she made a point of saying how 'excited' she was to 'finally have a baby in the family'. Still feeling (obviously) raw, I politely excused myself to go outside to take a breather, but as I was leaving the table I heard her say, \"Oh what's the big deal, I had a miscarriage when I was younger and you dont see me making a big deal out of it.\" That was it for me, honestly. That was the defining moment where I just had enough of her. \n\nNow, she is 78 years of age - and is on Facebook more than anyone I know. I have her blocked on Facebook (after major inappropriate behavior and aggressively interacting with friends of mine) from seeing what I post about 99.9% of the time, but when I post about our IVF treatment, I unblock her temporarily. Not because I want her to know, but because she lives with my Aunt, and if my Aunt mentioned seeing something on Facebook and Nana realized  that she was blocked, it would cause my Aunt (and I) drama. When I posted about our FET coming up, a few close friends commented of course, and one asked if our meds would be as expensive as they were for our first round of IVF. I told them thankfully no, but we still have to pay for them out of pocket. Well apparently after reading this interaction my Nana decided to paypal me $50, but not before she posted on Facebook about giving me money. She had to make sure to let everyone know that she 'helped', because that is more important to her than anything else. I am still unsure what I want to do about the money - on principle, I dont want it, but refusing it might make more waves than I need in my life right now. \n\nI of course messaged her to thank her for her generosity, hoping that would be the end of it. After a few questions, she then dropped this little ditty on me:\n\n\"I am very confident that *we* are going to have a baby.\"\n\nWe, huh? I didn't realize you were my husband... or the team of doctors/nurses/embryologists who have been trying to get me pregnant. I also didn't realize that WE are getting regular twat wandings, and catheters inserted into our cervix. We have so much in common!\n\nI really dont know why her statement bothers me so much. I'm not sure if it's because that \"we\" includes her in this process when she clearly did not give a shit about my suffering that LED US HERE. I'm not sure if it's the fact that the \"we\" implies that she has some sort of possession over our unborn, but it really made me sick inside when I read that. \n\nI know we all have different pet peeves here, but my biggest infertility pet peeve is when people tell me that treatment will work for us. In fact, I have posted about this topic on Facebook numerous times. That Resolve article that talks about IVF ettiquette and what not to say? I have posted that (or a similar article) several times over the years. She has even commented saying, \"some people are so thoughtless.\" I have posted it enough to know that she should know how I feel, but here she is ignoring it anyway. Hell, my RE doesn't even use phrases of certainty like that and she is the one we have entrusted to help us. So if the specialized Doctor is not giving me platitudes, could you maybe just NOT? There are no guarantees in this process, so you can take your confidence and shove it up your ass. I hate how people think IVF is just a 'fix all', that you do a round of IVF and poof you are pregnant. \n\nWhat I am confident in, is my team of supporters, doctors, and nurses. We have entrusted them to help us, but the rest is up to my body and just pure luck/chance. \n\nI'm sorry for the rant, I really try not to let this sort of stuff get to me, but after our IVF failure, I have days where I feel really resentful. \n\nI hope everyone has a good holiday weekend! \n\nXOXO", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Toxic Family Member RANT", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4qu7jh/toxic_family_member_rant/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1467410541, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4quagy/pros_and_cons/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4quagy", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 24, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4quagy/pros_and_cons/", "retrieved_on": 1472833899, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "What was good this week?

I made the personal decision to begin hormone treatment prior to fertility treatment out of necessity and lack of funds. My menstrual cycle was interrupted three months after the initiation of testosterone injections. I have been pregnant and have miscarried prior to male hormone treatment. I have been off male hormone therapy for almost three months, and resumed my menstrual cycle 4 weeks ago.\n\nGoal:\nI am currently looking to preserve my ability to have children, as there is minimal data on how male hormone therapy affects a trans male's fertility over time. I have a biologically male partner in his early thirties (not the same partner from the pregnancy) and we are not ready to have children at this point in time, but we would like to retain the ability for the future. I would like to accomplish egg/embryo banking in the near future so that I may continue my transition with a hysterectomy, lowering the possibility of certain cancers and my testosterone dosage requirements.\n\nFunding:\nMedical or personal loans are not likely to be an option, as our credit is poor and we would like to not take on more debt. We do not have money saved up at the moment, however, $5k expenditure on fertility and up to ~$10k is feasible if possible, but would take a longer time frame to save.\n\nInsurance:\nI carry Blue Cross Blue Shield and am listed as female in the system (I have not changed my legal gender). After a talk with a benefits specialists, it was revealed to me that initial diagnosis would be covered, however, fertility coverage includes a 20% co-pay after deductible and covers labs and x-rays only. I have $458 remaining for my yearly deductible. IVF and cryopreservation are not covered. \n\nReproductive Endocrinologist:\nWe are having an information session with the endocrinologist in a week and a half to explore our options.\n\nThe Question:\nMy knowledge on the subject is extremely limited, and I am having trouble finding answers to the fundamental questions. I thought that this would be a safe place to ask these questions. I presume that our primary option is through IVF treatment and egg/embryo banking. However, I was wondering if it is possible to fertilize the egg though sexual intercourse, and then use retrieval for embryo banking. Is embryo retrieval a possibility, or is it necessary for us to undergo IVF treatment? Our goal is to avoid the high costs of IVF.\n\nI have done some surface research in fertility tourism and have estimated that Israel would be a reasonable alternative for low-cost IVF, and has the benefit of being LGBT-friendly (unlike some alternatives such as India, with even lower IVF costs). I have read estimates such as $5.5k for Israel for IVF, and ~$900 for round-trip airfare (which of course would be incurred again if an additional cycle is necessary), whereas the treatment in the U.S. (where I am located) ranges from $9k-$12k. I was also wondering if it was possible to transport my partner's sperm to the country where IVF will be undertaken to avoid higher transportation costs.\n\n**TL;DR: I am female-to-male trans male (pre bottom surgery) with a male partner seeking to freeze my eggs/embryos for future use.**\n\n**Edit: Thanks to everyone for bringing the cost of gestational carrying to the front of my mind. I was so concerned with the egg retrieval process that I hadn't given much weight to this more costly issue. I am likely now to postpone my hysterectomy so that I can carry myself or to plan on adoption. I will still meet the RE and report back.**\n\n**Edit: I wanted to thank everybody for being so helpful and understanding. I will update when I return from the RE next week.**\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Transmale Pregnancy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4qz3in/transmale_pregnancy/"}]}
