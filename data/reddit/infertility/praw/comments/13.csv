I don't think it's just about the risk associated with having an auto immune disorder since the risk is gone when celiac is treated with a gluten free diet. Maybe there is a difference in the definition between POF and ""early menopause"" that I don't understand.  [This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21646922) study was one.  Summarized on another website:

""Women suffering from celiac disease tend to have nutrient deficiencies and lower estrogen levels, which could explain the earlier onset of menopause. In order to examine this relationship, researchers conducted a study involving103 postmenopausal women: 45 celiac-free women; 33 women with celiac disease that wasn’t diagnosed until after menopause; and 25 women with celiac disease who had been diagnosed and followed a gluten-free diet for at least 10 years prior to menopause.

The researchers found that, on average, women with untreated celiac disease went through menopause about three years earlier than their counterparts, which means they have a shorter “fertile life span.” Furthermore, they had a higher rate of miscarriages and premature births.

The researchers concluded that diagnosing celiac disease early might help delay early menopause—possibly because it could help prevent some of the nutritional and hormonal deficiencies associated with celiac disease.""

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just about the risk associated with having an auto immune disorder since the risk is gone when celiac is treated with a gluten free diet.

Stress doesn't cause an organ to fail like that - then every woman out there would have non functioning ovaries.  Pot doesn't cause your ovaries to fail. Diet...  diet can cause you to become anovulatory if your BMI is too low...  Raising your BMI can make it return.  But that is not Premature Ovarian Failure.  

Like you, I was 16 when I was diagnosed with premature ovarian failure.  I'm 32 now.  

POF can be caused by Autoimmune disorders in which antibodies attack the ovary causing irrepairable damage to them.  The second cause is Follicle Depletion.  This is when your folicles stop responding to the signal of FSH being released and begin to die off. A broken link in the whole cycle process and your organ begins to atrophy.  The cause of this can be exposure to a virus.  Chromosomal defects like Turner Syndrome (what I have) and X Syndrome.  A genetic predisposition in your family (which accounts for 10% of POF diagnosis') and exposure to chemo therapy or radiation treatments.  

What was your FSH at?  That along with AMH levels will help determine the specific diagnosis.  High FSH shows that the ovaries are no longer responding to the hormone.  Have they done a Karyotype Test on you?  If not, it would be worth it to have it done.  

That said, your most important job right now in addressing your diagnosis is to keep yourself as healthy as possible.  

Take your hormone replacement therapy!  This is important because it will keep your uterus and heart and bones healthy.  I'm 32 now and have osteopenia because I slacked in my youth.  It sucks, but you really do need to take that along with calcium suppliments and Vitamin D3.  If you are overweight, got to work on getting to your healthy BMI.  Follow a heart healthy diet as best you can, high cholesterol levels are common with POF.  

Finally, I would start saving now if you decide at some point in your life to build a family.  Saving now will help alleviate potential costs later on...  or you can use the money for other things if you decide to be child free or if at some point in the future infertility insurance becomes a mandate in more states or you live in one at that point.",[],,t1_cw48x6n,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>No, none of those things are likely a reason for your ovaries to fail.  </p>

(I also used mixing needles and not those Q caps). You definitely lose fluid, but losing more than half is surprising.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about the liquid still in the needle, though. You can&#39;t get that out. </p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t panic about the missing fluid. This is just your first shot, so you&#39;ll hone your skills. AND if you need more meds, your RE can tweak your dosage after your first monitoring appointment.</p>

<p>Congrats on getting started!!</p>

Sorry that you have to be here, but glad you found us. 

My first RE (reproductive endocrinologist) had a saying ""If you make any sperm, I have something to work with. You have sperm! I have something to work with!""

We are definitely RE biased here. The group is self-selected to be seeing specialists and being open to medication and usually at least one kind of treatment, but not everyone is definitely doing IVF. 

There are treatments that don't involve embryo tinkering and are far less invasive (Google ""IUI""). I would imagine at least some, if not most, people who believe in life at conception still being OK with IUIs. IUIs might be available to you if your count improved a little (say if they could give you hormone treatment for low testosterone) but was still low, so don't let what I'm about to say scare you away from seeing an RE at all. 

IVF creates embryos outside the body. They can ""die"" before they are transferred back, transferring them isn't the same as making sure they ""implant"" so that they become a pregnancy, and there can be extras left over if it goes well. Lots to think about. 

If you think you might have spiritual challenges around IVF even if it's residual impressions of values, if it ends up being in the cards, I highly recommend counseling. You could even be dealing with dividing embryos that they tell you they don't transfer because they're not normal. But if you feel that embryos are life, it will be tough to deal with a process where you watch them ""live"" for a few days and not make it. 

And those didn't even implant. Early miscarriages (ie lost after only a few days of positive blood tests) are so common my doctor doesn't consider them as data for our diagnosis... Most couples don't notice them. But in the care of an RE you might learn that one happened even if you didn't have symptoms (or in one of my cases, had negative home tests but was pregnant and lost it immediately). So the treatment might shine a light on the ugliness of nature that doesn't match with some societies' views of when life begins. 

Good luck while you're learning the lingo and gathering your insurance and referral info.

It must be quite a shock to see those results, but you have options, especially living in CT. Connecticut is a GREAT state to be in if you require IVF. 

It's great you have a healthy lifestyle. A few healthy habits are rough on fertility, though, so your doctors may advise some changes to doing less. If your exercise involves lots of biking, you may need cut back because of the pressure from the seat. Excessive cardio can also be detrimental, though some is good. Also, avoid hot tubs and saunas, the heat can hurt sperm production. I don't think anyone has mentioned yet, any changes you make will take 3+ months for the full effect to be reflected in a semen analysis. It takes 3 months to make and mature new sperm.

We all go along in life assuming we can have kids if we want them.  We spend time thinking about how to prevent kids, not the real possibility that we will have a hard time getting kids here. 12% of couples experience some level of infertility, so unfortunately, you are in good company.  
Like everyone else said, you need a reproductive endocrinologist and a urologist who specializes in male infertility.  The OBGYN may be able to refer you or you can do a google search.  You and your wife will both have more tests done.  It's very important for both parties to be throughly tested because we've seen on this sub situations where one person's issue was known and the couple moved forward with treatment not realizing that the other person also had fertility issues.  You'll get a second SA (sperm analysis) and examined by the urologist.  Your count may be treatable to some degree but I will warn you, most treatments don't get a man from 1 million to 20+ million (20 million is considered low normal) so there is a very good chance that fertility treatments are in your future, if that's what you and your wife decide.

What treatments?  Well, if you can get your count up significantly, interuterine insemination (IUI) might be an option.  That is where your wife would be monitored for impending ovulation and then your sperm will be squirted into her uterus.  It's not painful (most of the time).  You'd need to get *a lot* higher count though.  They want at least 5 million sperm good sperm- which means 5 million mobile sperm (you might have seen 'motility' on your SA.  That's how many sperm are mobile.  So if your motility was 50%, and your count was 1 million, you had 500,000 mobile sperm- that means sperm that can swim well.) 

Your next option would be IVF.  That is where your wife would be given medications that will make her produce 5-25 eggs in a single cycle and then the doctor would go in and surgically remove those eggs.  Then the doctor would inject a sperm into each egg and grow each fertilized egg for five days and put 1-2 back in your wife's uterus later.  The other fertilized eggs would be frozen.  This is invasive but completely do-able.  I say that as a doctor/medical shit/medicine/needle-phobe.  I had never had surgery and was on zero medications before IVF, so if I've survived, anyone can.  

The third option is donor sperm.  If you and your wife decide IVF is not for you, she can do IUI with donor sperm.  

Are you in the USA or elsewhere?  If USA, we can talk insurance and costs when you are ready.  Also, let your wife know there is a lot of support here, tons of ladies who are in the same position she is in and can help walk her through everything.

I'm a guy with low-ish count as well and I know how devastating that first SA (semen analysis) can be.

The first thing to know is that while 1 million/mL is very low, the fact that you have that many means your body is producing some, and that modern in-vitro fertilization (IVF) methods can help, especially if your wife has no fertility issues (if she hasn't been checked for the basics, she should be just to be sure). BUT don't jump immediately to assuming you need to do IVF. The first thing you should do is make an appointment with a urologist who s*pecializes in male fertility* (this is important! the fact that the OBGYN said they had never seen lower than 1M/mL suggests to me that they don't have a lot of experience with male fertility issues).

What they will likely do is order a second SA to make sure the low count was not a fluke, and do a physical exam to check you for varicocele (basically, overly large veins in the scrotum that can cause your testicles to be too hot and impair sperm production). If you have a varicocele, it can be fixed with outpatient surgery.

They may also order a blood test to check your testosterone and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) levels. If FSH is low, then you may be able to take a drug called Clomid to boost it and therefore boost your count. Clomid is technically a drug prescribed for women to stimulate ovulation, but in men it can boost sperm production (I've been on a low dose for 10 weeks and I just found out yesterday that my count increased from 9 million/mL to 51 million/mL). If your FSH is already high, then it means your body is already doing everything it can to make sperm, and you may have to consider IVF.

Meanwhile, try to do everything you can to live a healthy lifestyle: exercise, try to maintain a healthy weight, eat well, don't smoke, don't drink too much, etc. And wear boxers instead of briefs.

If your clomid cycle is going to be well monitored (lots of scans close to ovulation, the clinic will tell you when to have sex, etc), then you don't need to temp from a monitoring perspective. For question 2, if temping makes you feel good, keep doing it.

She knows we just finished IVF. She actually said those quotes TO ME right before telling me &quot;no one who matters will be upset if you have to quit the IVF cycle (due to my numerous health problems from it).&quot; I almost commented on her post &quot;no one would be upset if you had to give up the baby now.&quot; </p>

<p>I wish she would fall off the planet. Okay- I feel better. I&#39;ll probably delete this later out of paranoia. </p>

I have had recurring dermoid cysts with 4 surgeries by age 25, dermoids in both ovaries each time until right ovary was removed. Let me start off with that this is not common, so don't let me scare you with that. I had 3 laparotomies and 1 laparoscopic procedure. The vertical incision healed uneven due to how they stitched it, but that's purely cosmetic. I was unable to walk fully upright for weeks, and had prolonged difficulty with abdominal exercises due to the scar tissue pulling at different places in my abdomen(it was months before it didn't bother me any more). 


In my case, the surgeries were the direct cause of my infertility, but AGAIN, it is not normal to have this many recurrences and I was told that many women have this done with no or minimal fertility issues. In my case the scar tissue caused my tube to adhere to the side of the ovary and it became blocked(possibly from 1st surgery). During my 3rd surgery there was no way for them to separate the dermoid from the tube/ovary/scar mess, so they just removed the whole right ovary and tube. The remaining left one turned out to have the tube blocked as well due to scar issue, but on top of that they had apparently removed so much ovarian tissue each surgery that I only have a small portion of ovary left, resulting in diminished ovarian reserve.


I want to caution you in this surgery to get an experienced surgeon, as reducing the amount of internal scar tissue is very important in retaining use of the tube. My initial surgery was done in a teaching hospital, and if I hadn't had any repeats or had only had the dermoid on one side, I could have still had use of one tube to conceive naturally. For my last surgery they brought in an oncology surgeon because it was my only ovary and they'd had to remove the other the last surgery due to the scarring, so they wanted to be sure they did it right. This is when I learned that there was a lot of scarring from the original surgeries, and that my ovarian tissue was greatly reduced. This surgeon was able to free up a lot of scar tissue via laparoscopic procedure, even though my dermoid was 9cm diameter and mostly solid.


I want you to proceed cautiously because in my situation none of the doctors until the final one made me aware of how these surgeries would affect the size of my ovary, use of tubes, etc, because I was ""so young, you don't need to worry about that.""


Obviously each situation is different and I don't know your details, but I was given the same percentage each time for possible cancerous situation, but the actual cancer surgeon was perfectly comfortable doing a laparoscopy instead of laparotomy.

It&#39;s ok to have differing opinions and to not be happy about something, but in my opinion, that&#39;s pretty terrible... OP, you are pregnant too! One day, hopefully when I am pregnant and passed this painful and difficult phase, I hope to be as brave in speaking up about my experiences. I don&#39;t think pregnancy discredits what you went through to get there. No need to bring other women down when they were doing something so positive, just because it wasn&#39;t done as perfectly as you would have liked. Lets not take away from the awareness Tyra and Chrissy brought to our amazing, powerful community. </p>

I've done estrogen priming with no affect at all. I've done no priming/suppression with no affect at all. Over recent appointments my baseline has been okay, but the results are alway one follicle and nothing more. Hey, I produce one follicle on my own--thanks for nothing expensive medications and needles.

My first RE humoured me through some cancelled IVF cycles (in which some weirder things started happening with my one follicle) and then started throwing the word ""egg donor"" around a lot. But yeah, she wasn't really willing to do anything more. I know the math and the statistics and have obsessed over the process, so she's not wrong in that my chances of getting pregnant with my own eggs are shit, no matter how much intervention we try. 

My second RE's theory is that the FSH receptors in my ovaries are busted and it takes my body so much effort to just put out that one follicle, that no amount of stim or suppression or other manipulation is going to get it to work any harder. i.e., there is fuck all that can be done.

I don't have a positive story for you because *cough* I'm still here. 

But I am also still trying. I've had a lot of months to come to terms with my shitty, shitty odds. In some ways, it helps that I know exactly what my chances are and why. I know there's no point in searching for a miracle combination of protocols because it does not exist. Acceptance is a lot easier when there are fewer unanswered questions. I mean, beyond ""Why me?""  There's no answer to ""Why me?""

Much soul searching later, the only conclusion I have is shitty odds or not, I am not ready to quit yet. And I'm not ready to move to an egg donor either. 

Anyway, because no medication protocol will work on me, I'm not using any medication anymore. I'm doing something called Natural Cycle IVF, which is what they used to do back in the days when IVF was new and untried and they hadn't figured on optimizing the process with stimming yet. It's basically IVF one egg at a time.... they often do it at a cheaper price (and my clinic is absurdly cheap about it) so I figure I can keep doing this a while yet.  

Doing natural cycle, you don't get cancelled for having only one follicle, because you're expecting only one follicle. The odds of natural cycle suck balls. But they suck about equal balls to the odds of doing regular IVF when you can't get more than one egg a time. My clinic is still cool with me taking Clomid or some such to see if we can improve on the one follicle (and still billing me as 'natural cycle') but it's a longshot. 

I figure my only other options are IUI (increasingly less of an option for me because my cycles are getting wacky), timed intercourse (same wacky cycle issue), donor eggs or calling it quits. Basically, I take it cycle by cycle.... of all the options, what do I want to do? So far, it's 'keep trying this one-egg-at-a-time IVF'. 

I've mentally prepared myself to do this back-to-back cycles for several months. It sucks, but at the moment I prefer it to the other options. Down the road, I'll take time off and re-evaluate, but in the meantime, it is what it is.

EDIT: My reply to /u/cptnadventure reminded me of a couple of other things.

There is actually, a very, very, very experimental treatment (like, literally never been tried before; there is a related treatment for IVF failures called AUGMENT that made some press earlier this year but I think they are still at like maybe 1 live birth) that they are beginning to start trialling that could help DOR, but a) never been done before and anything related to it has not been done very much, b) expensive as fuck, c) right now, there is exactly one place in the world trying it, which is (I think) my clinic in Toronto which is where they had the first AUGMENT baby.... they are pretty hush-hush about the whole thing, d) it's still not generally available since I asked about it and was told ""if it the results of this experiment go well, we'll see"" and if they're waiting for a live birth for confirmed results, that's a long time from now, and e) even if it were available here, it's unlikely to be available in the USA for a while because of how the FDA does approvals for things like this--lots more testing is needed before they can trial it.

In any case: http://www.ovascience.com/treatments/ovaprime

There is also a process called IVM, which is fairly rare. Basically, they harvest eggs from the immature follicles (like, the small ones you see at baseline) and then let them mature them in the lab. It's more typically used for people at risk of OHSS (and therefore can't stim) or cancer patients, but apparently they are starting to use it on DOR.

The best thing you can do is get knowledgable. Find out (if you don't know already) your doctor's reasoning for both options. Figure out what makes the most sense.

Ganirelix is used to suppress ovulation. It also slows down follicle growth with is why it's (usually) taken fairly close to ovulation and also often taken in conjunction with a stim. It looks like ganirelix is sometimes also used to as follicle growth suppression (like Lupron or BCP, etc) though this is somewhat less common.

Suppression (like, growth suppression) is used to a) prevent follicles  from being recruited too early which sometimes happens when your ovarian reserve is low and b) to quiet the FSH receptors in the ovaries so that when you hit them with stims, they react more strongly. The reason this approach is not always used is that some people get over-suppressed or don't recover from suppression quickly so them follicle growth afterwards is sluggish. (This is common for those of us whose ovaries aren't producing much.) In some people (*raising my hand*) suppression doesn't make any difference at all. It's probably worth trying suppression just in case, because there's no surefire way to tell who will react well to what--but you've done that with lupron.

I'm guessing your new doctor's reasoning is that he'd rather you wait and start stimming once this cycle begins because he's thinks that the suppression is not doing what it's supposed to--either it's slowing down the follicle growth when you move to stimming, or it's just not doing anything at all so why take it?

He's your age - no pain, though - but normal testicular size, normal labs, etc etc etc.  However, after 8 months of trying, I just felt something was off.  Got him tested and received a diagnosis of azoospermia.  Urologist suspected a blockage via physical exam, in addition to my husband actually missing his vas deferens on one side.  So, not only were we operating one side down, the one connected side was blocked.  

They also recommended IVF w/ICSI, as it was really the only choice.  My husband underwent a PESA procedure, where they were successful in retrieving 6 vials (the most they'd take) of perfectly, healthy sperm.  I believe the PESA cost us around $3,000 out of pocket, as we had zero infertility benefits.  Sperm storage was a separate cost with our clinic.

With the stored sperm, we underwent a fresh IVF cycle that failed and then a subsequent FET later on.  Between the fresh cycle and FET, we looked into having the blockage actually repaired via a vasoepididymostomy, which is literally the same procedure they perform for vasectomy reversals.  Ultimately, it was successful, in that the urologist was able to bypass the blockage and reconnect the vas to itself further down the line.  However, I think too much scar tissue built up because it did not fix the problem - my husband's SA's were still coming back zero.  Two years later (present day) they're still zero.  I called our insurance literally 3 different times before the procedure in addition to the actual doctors office calling to verify our benefits.  Every time they told me it would be covered and just a $25 outpatient surgery copay.  However, after the surgery, our insurance tried to bill us $4,000 in doctor's fees.  It took my 9 months of fighting, but I eventually won with the second appeal and we didn't have to pay anything.

So, it's kind of a crapshoot, honestly.  Depending on your wife's health, if she doesn't have any fertility concerns and if they are able to retrieve sperm from you that is healthy, your chances with IVF are pretty good, as were ours.  (TRIGGER - mention of success for context) Ultimately, we were successful with our second treatment, an FET, so the retrieval and IVF worked for us, while the reparation surgery did not.  We are now facing secondary infertility, should we want anymore children, but we truly did exhaust every option, so we can at least move forward with more treatments, knowing that's it or nothing.

I wouldn't know why you have so much cervical mucus when you aren't ovulating or having a cycle at all.  Many women experience vaginal dryness because of birth control.  

I'm not a medical professional, but here is what I know about cervical mucus.  There are different types of CM depending on where a woman is in her cycle.  Clear and stretchy or clear and watery would suggest you have excess estrogen, white and thick would suggest excessive progesterone.  If it is clear and stretchy, maybe you could try a mini-pill, which is progesterone only.  If it is thick and white, I'm not sure what you can try other than just giving a different pill a whirl.  You could also look into a hormonal IUD.  Some pills are tricyclic, which means they have three different doses of hormones and it is supposed to replicate your natural cycle and some are monocyclic, which is the same hormones at the same dose each day.  It might be worth it to switch to whatever you aren't doing now.  

Another option would be to try a menstrual cup to catch the cervical mucus.  The mucus originates up by your cervix, so the cup should catch it and keep it from ruining your underwear or making you feel gross.  Not ideal by any means but it should work if a med change doesn't help.

Keep talking to doctors.  If your doctor doesn't listen, find a new one.  I've learned that some doctors are focused only on treating the diagnosis- in your case regulating your hormones.

Much of that was attributed to coping with things going on at home (environment) and also due to chemical imbalance (hormones all fucked up from menopause at 16) to dealing with chronic illness.  (What really do people expect when you're faced with a chronic illness with no hope for any cure.)  And at the time being undiagnosed with Lupus, it's also possible that at some of the worst moments I may have had Lupus involvement.

Anyhow...  I've been on Zoloft, prozac, wellbutrin, lexapro, Symbyax (combo of Zyprexa and Prozac), Lamictal, Trileptal, Risperadol.  I was on Xanax for a brief amount of time during some more troubling moments.  

I've had one hospitalization for Depression (with psychotic episodes) Lots and lots of therapy.  They kept insisting of psychoanalysis but I found I did much better with therapy that was geared towards Cognitive Behavior Therapy. 

Lets fast forward to now...  I have been medication and episode free for a grand total of 6-7 years.  I still get some depression, but for the most part I'm relatively good at keeping a strong family and friend support system.  I'm using the skills I learned from therapy.  Doing really really well!  

Along comes the time for us to use ART to buuild our family.  I'm being given hormone medications...  injections..  the stress...  on top of dealing with Lupus related things.  I'm working full time long hours.  After our first cycle, at the end, my husband and I decided we needed to seek out counseling to address how to effectively manage our stress levels, learn better communication between the two of us (we cope in opposite ways which makes us at odds sometimes) and overall figure out how to deal with the mood swings (both of us not just me controlling them but him learning how to validate how I feel and not try to fix everything) and how to handle the grieving when we're not successful.  

We've been at this for a year with 3 failed cycles.  I can legit say I'm depressed.  I'm not on any medication for it - I'm still going to my therapist weekly.  But both my husband and I have withdrawn from our friends and our lives.  We lost enjoyment of certain activities we used to love.  My sleeping pattern is erratic again.  I'm easily moved to emotional outbursts.  This shit is hard.  When you already have a pre-disposition to depression or a history I can only imagine just how much harder it can be!  

Our clinic is cross country so any resources they offer regarding infertility counseling isn't very valid for us.  We went through our work's EBS to seek out someone to take us on as a client and since I had a pre-existing condition we were able to go through insurance after EBS ran out.  Our counselor is an FMT but she's really great and so we felt good about seeing her.  

I would definitely, if you are not already, make sure your medication for your depression is being handled by a psychiatrist and not your normal primary care physician.  If you need medication changes for any reason they would be better known to help.  If you don't have a counselor it may be beneficial to find one to at least be able to followup on how you're doing emotionally during all this.  

After our last cycle resulted in another abnormal pregnancy that lead to doing a D&C and methotrexate shots, we've decided to hold off until the next year for another go.  Part of it is, we want to get healthy emotionally before we try again.  We're working on getting back into being social with friends and going on a trip for pleasure rather than a trip for infertility.  It's rough.  And it sucks.

I used to ice but I no longer do.  I found less bruising with not using ice.  You should be okay to use your numbing cream/spray.  

Biggest tip I can give you, count to 10 slowly before you remove the needle, this will minimize bruising.  To avoid the burning sensation, inject as slowly as you can.  if it starts to burn, just give it a minute before you continue to push it.  The instructions say not to aspirate the needle before the injection, it's intentionally there so you get the full dose and the medication isn't then left in the needle - or at least as much of it as possible.

I found that there are spots on my stomach that have less nerves than other places and were more comfortable with doing the shot vs the places that had more nerves?  I don't know if that is standard or just me.

For any blood draws for your tww, make sure you tell them you're on an anticoagulant when they do the draw.  As for your PIO while on Lovenox, you will likely have more bleeding for the IM shots, just don't be alarmed, you'll likely need to use a tissue to apply pressure after the IM shot.  Unless you're in a major accident, getting a small cut isn't an emergency.  Lovenox won't prevent clotting in general, it just reduces the time it takes to clot.  Small cuts or your IM shots just take longer to stop bleeding.  It is normal for an RE to place you on lovenox and baby aspirin daily but if you need NSAIDs for other reasons stick with tylenol mostly because it's the only safe pain reliever to use during pregnancy (so I've been told)

1) it's not a vitamin-K based anti-coagulant, which means you don't need to keep an eye on your diet as you would with Coumadin, but it also doesn't have a quick 'antidote' (through vitamin K injection) f something were to happen

2) injections are similar to those for IVF, though if you have the pre-filled syringes you don't need to keep pressing until the needle cover pops--if you do, you're going to give yourself some nasty bruises. Inject normally, pull it out, then give a final push to get the cover to pop.

3) rotate the injection site at least an inch apart

4) be very careful about cuts obviously and bloody noses. It can be very hard to stop bleeding. If you have any scabs from old cuts, cover them because if they fall off you will bleed (seriously, my dad stained his couch because he didn't realise a scab had fallen off and that he was bleeding!). If your skin is dry and prone to cracking, moisturise

5) no aspirin, no aleve, no ibprofen. Just Tylenol.

6) if you feel woozy, disoriented, etc, call your Dr and let them know. The first few days may be a bit funky, but if you can't stand without feeling like you're going to pass out, you may need your dose adjusted.

I have a history of anxiety, but it wasn't until IF that I really experienced depression. I was, hands down, the most single successful member of my PhD cohort until working through IF. I completely fell behind and apart. Then, when I did get pregnant, it never really shifted. 8 months after my son was born, I wrote my suicide note and was choosing which of my husbands ties would be sturdiest to hang myself (this was three days after Robin Williams' death).

My clinic had a therapist, and you got one optional free consult per cycle that had to be scheduled separately (the rest were pricey!), but by the time I was really having problems, I was cut free from them. I wish they had offered resources--even just a pamphlet!--once you had your child. They mailed me a form to fill out about all of his birth info, so it would have been easy enough to add some material.

I know it's triggering to mention here, but I think it's important to remind women who have come out the other side that, if they yell at their child, it doesn't make them a bad mother. If they flip out, it doesn't mean God was trying to tell you something by making you infertile (which I told myself allllll the time. That I shouldn't have pushed it). And if you are still struggling that it doesn't mean you will be a bad mother or that God is trying to tell you something as well. We go through so many emotions during this whole process, that I feel we should be routinely given a bit of a mental health assessment during the process.

<p>My clinic had a therapist, and you got one optional free consult per cycle that had to be scheduled separately (the rest were pricey!), but by the time I was really having problems, I was cut free from them. I wish they had offered resources--even just a pamphlet!--once you had your child. They mailed me a form to fill out about all of his birth info, so it would have been easy enough to add some material.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s triggering to mention here, but I think it&#39;s important to remind women who have come out the other side that, if they yell at their child, it doesn&#39;t make them a bad mother. If they flip out, it doesn&#39;t mean God was trying to tell you something by making you infertile (which I told myself allllll the time. That I shouldn&#39;t have pushed it). And if you are still struggling that it doesn&#39;t mean you will be a bad mother or that God is trying to tell you something as well. We go through so many emotions during this whole process, that I feel we should be routinely given a bit of a mental health assessment during the process.</p>

I had an ultrasound on day 15, which showed a 15mm follicle on the left ovary, and I was supposed to come back on day 19 for another ultrasound and continue taking the LH tests.  We went away overnight, and I forgot to bring the tests, but had tested right before we left, and then right when we came home (about 30 hours in between) and both showed no surge.

I thought I might have missed it, since I had that 30 hour window, but I go in for my ultrasound the next morning and the 15mm follicle is gone, so we assume I've already ovulated, and they do bloodwork to verify (this is day 19).

The bloodwork shows no sign of ovulation, so my doctor tells me to come back on day 21 and do more bloodwork, in case I ovulated right before my appointment, after the LH surge and before any E2 levels rose.  Day 21 bloodwork also shows no signs of ovulation.

At this point, my doctor thinks that I'm having an anovulatory cycle, and that we will need to skip the test we were going to do before transfer, and decide what to do next.  I keep taking LH tests, because why not, and it just doesn't seem normal for me to not ovulate, because I've never had a cycle when I didn't, but I was not exactly staring at the results when I took them -- I'd just pee on the stick, then stick it on the counter and look at it when I remembered next.

I am not a psychologist or medical professional, so this is anecdotal only, but although some people do struggle from situational depression (ie. prolonged period of grief after a loved one passing, a job loss etc) if you, like me, have a brain chemistry issue there isn't a different root cause to figure out and address.

We took a couple months off to think about it at which point my wife got her first pregnancy followed by her first miscarrage. </p>

<p>After that, we found out that my insurance will cover one IVF treatment, but not the medications. My entire savings would cover the meds. We decided it was worth it, so we took the plunge. 8 eggs retrieved, 3 fertilized, 3 viable. We transferred all three in. None took, it was a failed IVF cycle.</p>

<p>Now, i am faced with the decision to go into debt for another shot or not. We are leaning towards it, even looking into other contries that are cheaper. If the second IVF treatment takes, then it would all be worth it. </p>

Low carb/high protein may help IVF rates.  There are lots of weaknesses with the study but I think it is enough that it warrants further study but not enough to put your hopes on.  Some people have had luck with high protein diets.  It seems like ladies with PCOS often have good results by going with a keto type diet- which is extremely low carb, high protein, and moderate protein.

But then again, there was another [study](http://blog.shadygrovefertility.com/2012/12/20/recipe-for-fertility-mediterranean-diet/) done where people following a Mediterranean diet had better IVF success and it's unlikely that people following a mediterranean diet are getting at least 25% protein. 

To your exact question, both high protein/low carb and mediterranean have very limited sugar.  My secondary point is that it is easy to go down the google and emotional rabbit hole on diet changes.      ",[],,t1_cvoloc6,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p><a href=""http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803821"">Here</a> is something about low carb and another article about the <a href=""http://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2013/High-Protein-Low-Carb-Diets-Greatly-Improve-Fertility"">same study</a>.</p>

<p>Low carb/high protein may help IVF rates.  There are lots of weaknesses with the study but I think it is enough that it warrants further study but not enough to put your hopes on.  Some people have had luck with high protein diets.  It seems like ladies with PCOS often have good results by going with a keto type diet- which is extremely low carb, high protein, and moderate protein.</p>

Karyotyping- $600 each- got a significant 'insurance discount', whatever that means, paid $350 each.

SA- $150 each time.  Have had two.

<p>HSG- I think is going to be around $1500.  Insurance isn&#39;t going to pay up.</p>

<p>Karyotyping- $600 each- got a significant &#39;insurance discount&#39;, whatever that means, paid $350 each.</p>

<p>RLP- Insurance picked up all but $200.  Without insurance it would have been $1700 or something insane.  It was coded multiple pregnancy loss, not infertility, which is why insurance picked it up.</p>

<p>Hysteroscopy- $1200 including anesthesia- insurance did not help.</p>

>A notion emerged in 1996 that in some species, including humans, a significant fraction of sperm specialize in a manner such that they cannot fertilize the egg but instead have the primary effect of stopping the sperm from other males from reaching the egg, e.g. by killing them with enzymes or by blocking their access. This type of sperm specialization became known popularly as ""kamikaze sperm"" or ""killer sperm"", but most follow-up studies to this popularized notion have failed to confirm the initial papers on the matter.[55] While there is also currently little evidence of killer sperm in any non-human animals[56] certain snails have an infertile sperm morph (""parasperm"") that contains lysozymes, leading to speculation that they might be able to degrade a rivals' sperm.[57] -[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_competition)",[],,t1_cvnapeo,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>We&#39;re using them back to back.

<p>A notion emerged in 1996 that in some species, including humans, a significant fraction of sperm specialize in a manner such that they cannot fertilize the egg but instead have the primary effect of stopping the sperm from other males from reaching the egg, e.g. by killing them with enzymes or by blocking their access. This type of sperm specialization became known popularly as &quot;kamikaze sperm&quot; or &quot;killer sperm&quot;, but most follow-up studies to this popularized notion have failed to confirm the initial papers on the matter.[55] While there is also currently little evidence of killer sperm in any non-human animals[56] certain snails have an infertile sperm morph (&quot;parasperm&quot;) that contains lysozymes, leading to speculation that they might be able to degrade a rivals&#39; sperm.[57] -<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_competition"">From Wikipedia</a></p>

RE said it wasn't enough to explain the reason I wasn't pregnant yet.  For me, I've had so much testing I'm almost at the end of the line.  I've had the CD3 blood work- estrodial, AMH, FSH- all ""ideal"".  I've had 7DPO progesterone- 10 ng/ml and medicated always over 20 ng/ml.  I ovulate every cycle on the same day, I bleed on the same day.  I stimulate 2 eggs with a low dose of femara. I had 2-4 follicles for my injectable IUIs.  Husband's SA showed 250 million- 533 million sperm in the sample with about 34% motility, 4% morph.  My HSG the doctor said ""couldn't be better"".  We've done karyotyping- normal.  Hysteroscopy- normal.  RLP- one MTHFR gene (you need two for it to be expressed.  I started on folguard anyway, can't hurt).  Slightly elevated PAI-1 (48 on a scale of 10-45 being normal ranges) which is a clotting disorder but again, the RE said it doesn't explain the lack of pregnancy at all, lack of even CPs, and it isn't probably high enough to make any difference at all, but I'll be on lovenox for my FET regardless.  Again, can't hurt.  I have no autoimmune issues.  I've never smoked, done drugs, been overweight, or had an STD.  We did IVF twice and both times had weird results.  The first protocol was long lupron and going in I had 11 excellent follicles, a few smaller and I ovulated early and we only pulled 5 eggs.  2 were mature, 1 fertilized.  Second we did antagonist and I started with 11 follicles and over the course of the stims dropped to 6.  Got 5 eggs, 4 fertilized.  All together, we got one blast and in a stroke of amazing luck, it tested PGS normal.  10 eggs retrieved to 1 blast seems to me like there is an egg problem.  However, the RE, AGAIN, says that there might not be, I seem to over respond to suppression medications and the antagonist and that might be hurting my egg production and egg quality.

My stepbrother and his girlfriend had an accidental pregnancy and a baby this year but they&#39;re not close enough (distance-wise or emotionally) to necessitate me going to events.</p>

<p>No showers is my policy.  Hell, if it fucking <em>is</em> me who could be having one, I still won&#39;t have one.  I just hate them that much.  My go-to is to RSVP &quot;hell-to-the-no&quot; and throw $20 or $50 (depending on how close the person is to me) in a card and mail it away.</p>

<p>Now, if we did things here in North America the same way they did them in South Asia - where baby showers in bars at happy hour with significant amounts of alcohol and no games are pretty normal - then maybe I would drop by some people&#39;s showers.  Still not having one of my own, though!</p>

I knew we'd need to do IVF because of MFI but I just wasn't at that point emotionally yet.

But then on the other hand, I would hurt really badly every time someone else would get pregnant and I would think about the crappy hand we've been dealt. It almost became a game of ""which option do you hate more - doing IVF or being childless?"" For a long time the scale was tipped in favor of ""doing IVF"" but then ""being childless"" suddenly seemed worse.

It took us about 3 years to get up the balls to do IVF, and then our first cycle was horrific... so it was more waiting. I wish I had more advice for you, but I don't - it has been a sad few years.  

Infertility really did a number on my self-esteem too. I've never had issues with that in the past, but it just made me feel like less worthy of a person in general, and that I had nothing interesting to add, and that people were secretly pitying me. The only thing that made me feel better was doing things that people with families can't do (like going on an adult-ish trip, or going to a loud concert, or going camping) but honestly it didn't help that much in the long-term, it was just a bandaid. 

I hope you guys can find peace soon on when to start. I am the same age as you and one thing I was absolutely grateful for was that my back wasn't up against the wall with having to start yesterday. Having age as a factor makes everything that much harder. And your odds are GOOD being in your early 30s.

It almost became a game of &quot;which option do you hate more - doing IVF or being childless?&quot; For a long time the scale was tipped in favor of &quot;doing IVF&quot; but then &quot;being childless&quot; suddenly seemed worse.</p>

<p>It took us about 3 years to get up the balls to do IVF, and then our first cycle was horrific... so it was more waiting. I wish I had more advice for you, but I don&#39;t - it has been a sad few years.  </p>

<p>Infertility really did a number on my self-esteem too. I&#39;ve never had issues with that in the past, but it just made me feel like less worthy of a person in general, and that I had nothing interesting to add, and that people were secretly pitying me. The only thing that made me feel better was doing things that people with families can&#39;t do (like going on an adult-ish trip, or going to a loud concert, or going camping) but honestly it didn&#39;t help that much in the long-term, it was just a bandaid. </p>

<p>I hope you guys can find peace soon on when to start. I am the same age as you and one thing I was absolutely grateful for was that my back wasn&#39;t up against the wall with having to start yesterday. Having age as a factor makes everything that much harder. And your odds are GOOD being in your early 30s.</p>

<p>I will say the hardest part (sorry I keep rambling) for me was actually making the decision to get going. The rest was easier compared to that. To when you find you&#39;re ready, you&#39;ve already gotten past one of the hardest parts.</p>

Trying to conceive can be all-consuming, and when it doesn't happen it can be hard to find anything else as important. I have a few strategies that have worked for me; maybe they will help?

* start small - set realistic targets for what you want to do. For me, instead of setting a goal of getting back into working out, I just set a goal of getting into my workout clothes and driving to the gym. If I managed to do that, I would count it as a success. Inevitably I would end up going into the gym once there, but if I didn't, it was okay.

* monitor progress and celebrate any successes - in keeping with the gym example, I would ask myself how anxious or disinterested I felt about going to gym before driving there, on a scale of 1 to 10, and then again once I was in the parking lot, and try to notice the difference. I would not beat myself up if I didn't actually go into the gym that day, instead telling myself I had taken the first step.
* challenge thoughts - I work hard to continuously offer myself a different point of view when I find myself wanting to avoid something e.g. ""I can't bear being social today"" turns into ""if I keep up with my social skills, my one-day baby will learn great socialisation from me"". This is hard to do, and takes quite a bit of effort at times, but I have found it helpful.
* it is okay to have down days - I schedule in ""wallow"" days so that I get to spend time with my thoughts and feel sad about the struggle we are going through, without interruptions or responsibilities. Respecting these feelings and giving them space helps me to get on with the rest of my life on other days.

As I said, doing the above has helped me a lot and I find myself more able to be a complete person, not defined entirely by my infertility. I hope some of it helps you, too. That said, if you do find yourself low all the time, and unable to muster interest in any activities, and have changes to your sleeping and eating, and nothing you try seems to help, it is worth seeking advice from a mental health professional.

If this doesn&#39;t work, we will go onto IVF #2, but I know that isn&#39;t for everyone. Hugs from here.</p>

I booked two trips. One was in April, one was in July.... I figured, oh, plenty of time to get a few rounds of IUI in before the first one, and then that will be a good time to pause, make an IVF decision and then maybe do a round or two of IVF before we go away in July.

Then my cycle went super-screwy, and so between January and March I could only do 1 IUI. No go. Started the next cycle just before my April trip, thought it would be *just* fine since I typically ovulated early enough to make it, ended up ovulating later than usual, was panicking about having to cancel the cycle or cancel the trip, managed to *just* do the IUI the day before I left.

Then I moved to IVF, but had 3 cycles cancelled on Day 3 in a row... so nothing happened between April and June.

Second trip was late July, I started my cycle late June. Figured okay, enough time to stim and do the retrieval, maybe even the transfer but worst case I have to come back one day for that.... it's a long drive, but okay. Except then nothing grew and we waited and waited and finally we did the retrieval 2 days before we left (and I ovulated through it, which sucked, but that meant no embryo hunger games or returning for a transfer while on vacation.)

Honestly, I'm glad I took both trips because when I planned them it gave me a sense that I was still in control of my life, and when I was on them it was good to away somewhere--travel is a big part of my life. 

But after the last one, I made the decision: no more travel. My cycles are way unpredictable, and for me, with my ovaries running on fumes, cancelling or waiting one out just isn't an option I want to take. It was too stressful waiting to see if the timing would work or what adjustment we'd have to make or what.

(The other part of that decision, though, was that starting around February my MIL's health began to decline, and it was getting very touch and go starting in July, so it was another reason to stay put. She passed away a few weeks ago, but now my FIL is looking at possible back surgery, so it gives us another reason why we should stay put.)

We might still do day trips, or short last-minute trips that we can plan and do in the TWW, but otherwise, we're spending the next year not travelling. After that, maybe we'll do a big trip somewhere and make some decisions on what we do next.",[],,t1_cvl8x4p,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>We used to travel a lot, and back in January, in a fit of &quot;I won&#39;t let infertility control me!&quot; I booked two trips. One was in April, one was in July.... I figured, oh, plenty of time to get a few rounds of IUI in before the first one, and then that will be a good time to pause, make an IVF decision and then maybe do a round or two of IVF before we go away in July.</p>

<p>Then my cycle went super-screwy, and so between January and March I could only do 1 IUI. No go. Started the next cycle just before my April trip, thought it would be <em>just</em> fine since I typically ovulated early enough to make it, ended up ovulating later than usual, was panicking about having to cancel the cycle or cancel the trip, managed to <em>just</em> do the IUI the day before I left.</p>

<p>Then I moved to IVF, but had 3 cycles cancelled on Day 3 in a row... so nothing happened between April and June.</p>

<p>Second trip was late July, I started my cycle late June. Figured okay, enough time to stim and do the retrieval, maybe even the transfer but worst case I have to come back one day for that.... it&#39;s a long drive, but okay. Except then nothing grew and we waited and waited and finally we did the retrieval 2 days before we left (and I ovulated through it, which sucked, but that meant no embryo hunger games or returning for a transfer while on vacation.)</p>

Yes, I am having them both removed.  If I want to do IVF, which is my only way of conceiving as I have about a 1% chance on my own, I have to have them removed.  The hydrosalpinx way increases chances of miscarriage (because of the toxic fluid) and of ectopic pregnancy (because the tubes are swollen), so it would likely be a massive waste of effort and money to do IVF without removing the tubes.  We don't have the money for IVF, so there's a good chance I'll have to walk away from all of this childless, but at least I won't be afraid to have sex with my husband (the risk of miscarriage and ectopic remains even without IVF).

Have you screened your embyros(PGS)?  Are you transferring all of them at once?

My clinic believes that it was stimming that ""spread out"" the quality among too many eggs or follicles and that a different stim protocol can result in different egg quality. In my case we went from a short protocol to a long. My retrieval isn't until tomorrow but I have a very different follicle landscape, exactly what they were aiming for (about a dozen in the range to be mature, and only a couple over 9mm but undermature, unlike the dozens of 9mm+ but ultimately useless extra follicles last time). 

The first IVF cycle is more diagnostic than anything in some cases. Considering you didn't have any Day 5+ embryos my guess is that they will come back with a different plan for next time. 

I am also a victim of too-high expectations from my first RE. My two other REs since then have been dragging me down to reality but I still wasn't ready for last year's debacle. This year is about realistically trying again with different input and hoping for different output. And I know that I only want to hear about success rates based on the embryos I make, not based on the entire landscape of all 30 year olds doing IVF. 

Next steps: Recover. You cannot be expected to make ANY kind of big decision right now after what you put your body through. Take a break. Set an appointment with your RE in a few weeks (2, 4, 6, whatever you think is likely you'll need) so that the appointment is secured and you don't have to wait too long after you feel ready again. If you want to get a second opinion, it might be worth proactively getting that appointment locked down ahead of time too. 

Your RE was really obnoxious but this might bring him back to earth. If he doesn't adjust his own expectations down based on this first cycle, run. If you don't like seeing him or hearing his advice, run. But he might say ""OK, now that we have your data, we can work on an individual plan and individual expectations for *you*."" That would be a reason to stick with him. 

I don't think going back to the RE(s) is a decision in and of itself. Your RE's revised opinion and another second opinion will give you the data you need to make your decision to continue IVF or look into adoption. I'm *guessing* they won't be able to say whether or not IVF looks good for you until they try the alternate protocol, but that's just based on my history.

It sounds like your OB has not been entirely honest with you as 70% per cycle is really overly optimistic. In the very best case (pure MFI) with a very good clinic it is possible to get percentages over 50% but even then 70% is so exceptional it is likely they manipulated the numbers (for example, by including only perfect candidates). As your infertility seems to be unexplained, IMO it was inappropriate for your RE to give you a number at all because it depends on the underlying cause.

It is important to keep in mind that statistics apply only to large numbers. If, for example, the success rate is 50% it is reasonable to say that for 1000 patient-cycles about 500 should result in pregnancy. It can not, however, be concluded that if one patient has two cycles, one of them will likely result in pregnancy. It is perfectly possible in such a situation to have two or more failures entirely due to bad luck.

In your situation, you should not conclude that your situation is hopeless due to a single failure. This can easily be explained by bad luck. It is no reason to think that your next cycle won't be successful (although the same logic applies there: you shouldn't assume that it will be successful either). It is totally natural to think these things, but keep reminding yourself that this is a statistical fallacy.

With IVF and everything that goes with it, the highs are higher and the lows lower than previous cycles. If you can avoid it, take at least a month before making any big next step decisions.

Just because your first IVF failed doesn't mean that IVF #2 or #3 would fail, so as long as you guys have the resources and the will to continue with IVF it remains an option. Statistically, only 40% of first IVFs succeed. Also, statistically, there are diminishing success rates after 3 IVF fails.

I am concerned that your RE gave you a 70% success rate for what I can gather from your post is unexplained infertility.  There is a difference between being upbeat and positive and giving patients unrealistic success rates.

A second opinion never hurts. You are trusting your RE with something so important to you (and paying them a shitload of money too!) so being comfortable with them is important!

Yes while telling someone to relax and it'll just happen is dumb, destressing and working towards removing extra stress in your life during treatments is not.  It is actually beneficial.  Why?  Stress is not just some emotional plight, it's chemical.  When you stress you release hormones like cortisol.  Your body reacts to stress in different ways.  Some folks like myself find that it wrecks the immune system and are prone to getting sick easier.  Stress can lower your immune system's defenses.  Sickness can lead to inflammation which can be bad if it's in the wrong place like...  Your lining.  

Seriously stress is one of my biggest hurdles because it sets off my lupus flares which is kinda Fucking up my whole pregnancy chances here.  So yeah reducing your stress is actually medically pertinent.  You are already going to be emotionally taxed while on meds through this whole process so the more you can do to be healthier mentally and physically the easier it may be.  

That's why it's important to have a support system.  Talking to a counselor can help.  Yes doing. yoga or getting a massage...   Whatever you can do to destress is actually a good thing.  Don't discount it.  Now that alone won't get you pregnant, no..  but it doesn't hurt to keep you balanced and mentally healthy because Fucking infertility bullshit is hard enough.

Forgot to add, stress also raises your blood pressure and restricts blood flow.  Which is also important.  I say this having failed a stress management course in college.  Why I failed was because I skipped on the final lol...  So dumb, but I was stressed and slept in.",[],,t1_cvjdr67,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>So voice of dissent here...  Yes while telling someone to relax and it&#39;ll just happen is dumb, destressing and working towards removing extra stress in your life during treatments is not.  It is actually beneficial.  Why?  Stress is not just some emotional plight, it&#39;s chemical.  When you stress you release hormones like cortisol.  Your body reacts to stress in different ways.  Some folks like myself find that it wrecks the immune system and are prone to getting sick easier.  Stress can lower your immune system&#39;s defenses.  Sickness can lead to inflammation which can be bad if it&#39;s in the wrong place like...  Your lining.  </p>

<p>Seriously stress is one of my biggest hurdles because it sets off my lupus flares which is kinda Fucking up my whole pregnancy chances here.  So yeah reducing your stress is actually medically pertinent.  You are already going to be emotionally taxed while on meds through this whole process so the more you can do to be healthier mentally and physically the easier it may be.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to have a support system.  Talking to a counselor can help.  Yes doing. yoga or getting a massage...   Whatever you can do to destress is actually a good thing.  Don&#39;t discount it.  Now that alone won&#39;t get you pregnant, no..  but it doesn&#39;t hurt to keep you balanced and mentally healthy because Fucking infertility bullshit is hard enough.  Pamper yourself God dammit.</p>

<p>Forgot to add, stress also raises your blood pressure and restricts blood flow.  Which is also important.  I say this having failed a stress management course in college.  Why I failed was because I skipped on the final lol...  So dumb, but I was stressed and slept in.</p>

I didn't have much more spotting throughout the day, and it was a weird brownish liquid, not bleeding. Anyway, I figured it would start any minute but it didn't. Around 7pm, I had intense, very severe cramping and sharp pains all throughout my abdomen. As we were arranging for someone to come sit with our kids, I took a hot shower and tried to get through the pain. It came in waves and was very, very painful. By the time we left for the hospital however, the pain had totally stopped, and in its place was my usual achey side pain, and I was nauseous and a little dizzy/faint. We decided enough was enough, and just to go in.

I am SO glad I went in! I felt a little silly because the pain stopped before we got there, but I was still dizzy and nauseous and decided, to hell with it, I have been sitting on this decision all week. They were so nice and very thorough. I saw two ER docs, as well as the radiologist, and the hospital OB. There is definitely fluid on my right side and my ovary is where I've been having that pain all week. She also saw a small cyst that she thinks ruptured, and this is what caused the pain and the fluid. My HCG dropped to 158, cervix is closed. 

She said she's not sure what my doctor saw, but that she did NOT see a uterus full of blood, but rather an ""unremarkable"" uterus with a thicker endometrium lining, which would be typical for my situation. In her opinion, it could be a couple weeks of spotting before I even have a period, though it could certainly start soon. But that I needn't worry if it didn't start soon. And if I dont, because with pcos I usually don't on my own, she thinks it'd be a good idea to take Provera to start a period. 

In short, they're glad I came in, and I'm to come in again if I have that same horrible pain, but they're pretty confident it was a ruptured cyst, not an ectopic.

As of this morning I started bleeding, very very heavily. I've been having terrible cramps all day, but they're crampy and not sharp, stabby pains. I'm relieved and feel pretty confident that this is all over and done with now, and we're on our way to healing. I will repeat the HCG per my RE's request, later this week. 

It's going to be a few months at least until we try again, and I am going to see what I can find out about starting again with a new clinic entirely. I've thought about it a million different ways, and while my RE personally was very responsive during the last week or so, before that dealing with this clinic was a nightmare. I've had to do things I don't think patients should be responsible for. All but 2 of the nurses have been so callous and rude to me over the phone. I've had to call, and call, and call... and wait and call again just to get answers and clear responses about whatever protocol I was on. I was left on clomid/femara for a total of 13 cycles, which wasted time and wreaked havoc on my body, to the point where I was said to be totally resistant to the medication by 2 of the REs at the clinic.  All together, they were a means to an end for TTC and I could cope with that. But to deal with such craziness during this miscarriage/possible ectopic fiasco... I can't do that again with these guys.

I read a lot of forums, and this stuff happens all the time when they transfer the best ones and none of the rest make it to freeze. That's why they pick the best ones and put them inside of you, so it's more likely the others will peter out.

Best of luck to you.
