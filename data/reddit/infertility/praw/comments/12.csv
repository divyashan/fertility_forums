Do you have anxiety on a day to day basis?  

So I'm going to throw this out there...  Using Donor Eggs is an extremely costly process, even when going the natural FET route.  There is a lot that goes into the process at which you select a donor - whether or not you use an agency or if the clinic has a database.  The testing that goes into approving the person to be a donor, the psychological testing for both the donor and the recipients.  

You're looking at spending almost three times as much money on top of IVF costs.  You still have to go through paying for all meds and egg retrieval procedure etc.  

If that is appealing to you, then hey - I can certainly understand because going through any infertility stuff is difficult as is and many times we all try to find ways to reduce the impact on ourselves.  

That said, you're also looking at trying to find an RE who will be willing to use a Donor despite your ability to produce your own eggs.  You're basically saying the risk isn't worth it to you but the risk is okay for someone else.  It's entirely possible that a clinic may not see that as an ethical reason to use a donor.  

Ultimately, you experience a lot of emotions when you become hormonal - and it's entirely possible that even the hormones you produce while pregnant could cause you to experience a whole new host of emotions - especially adding in that so many things can happen while pregnant.  Have you considered a plan for how to address that?

In our case, my RE wanted me to get methotrexate sooner than later (I travel across the country for infertility stuff so we had to use our OB), but the first OB was at a catholic hospital and it was this whole stupid mess.  I had to switch OBs for more than one reason, but seriously...  it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry, you know?  </p>

<p>Anyway, don&#39;t stress too much. Your levels are dropping which is good. If your pain gets severe go to the ER. </p>

Naturally he was devastated and it took him a while to get over the initial shock.

Even if it turns out the numbers are low anyway, IVF with ICSI (what we ended up doing for a number of reasons, including his SA) will bypass the problem of low numbers because they manually select the 'best-looking' sperm out of his sample.

Hey guys, your clinic is 2h30 drive away, and there is the trivial thing called work....... You know, to pay most bills?

The urologist gave him a prescription for those vitamins (Fertil Pro and MTL), but he just took macca and zinc, and it did jack shit. So yesterday, he got the cocktail of vitamins. We'll see. Can't hurt.

We already chance clinic once. After they took 2 month to give the us the devastrous results of his first SA, and we waited for 5 months for the appointment with the urologist, that kept being canceled.

It might be our last chance to have the cycle covered by our provincial medicare, so we have to stay there. But all the nurse are very nice, and most of the staff. 

Many thanks, it's 6h20am and on the way to the hospital to get the blood samples and then back to work!

I'm glad they're making sure you're fighting fit. Better to have the all clear than have issues while pregnant.

I agree with you 100%, I don't know how our doctor could think these results were alright! Anyway, she's helpful.

I've heard there's going to be a private clinic opening up in my city soon, so we'll see how things go with trying to remedy the sperm issue before I get too worried about all that stuff.

He doesn't ever drink so that should be alright, but he is working on the weed stuff. I think he's pretty affected knowing he's basically infertile, so there's motivation there I think. He's used it to manage his disease symptoms and anxiety so it's a matter of slowly reducing and then quitting. He IS underweight due to his disease, but he tries as much as he can to gain weight.

If your progesterone was high before ovulation, you would never ovulate.   To get a good lab, you need to know what your progesterone level is the morning of 7DPO, so hopefully you are using temping and OPKs to determine exactly when that is. I would definitely take the time to look for a a new OB, but also negotiate with this one for a standing lab for progesterone you can use over 2 cycles while you do.   You go in on 7dpo, the number should be 10 or more.  If it's not, then the following cycle, use the Prometrium (vaginally is recommended) beginning the night of 2dpo or 3dpo if using it once a day, whenever ovulation appears well confirmed by your charting.   REs usually prescribe twice a day, so you can do morning and night if you like...  Use a lightdays, there is a little discharge.  Again, go get a 7dpo progesterone test, the number may not be a lot higher but it could be a bit more than the previous month.  If it is 10+ the first month but your LP is shorter than 11 days, plan on using the Prometrium next cycle anyway. 

Progesterone will often keep your period from coming even if you spot, so use a FRER on 14dpo, if it's positive, continue with the Prometrium, and when you call the OB to request a beta remind them you are on Prometrium and get that tested as well.

First of all, measuring your progesterone right now is USELESS.  Of course your progesterone is low, you HAVEN'T OVULATED YET!  The purpose of measuring progesterone is that it's measured 7 days *after ovulation* when it's supposed to be at its peak.  Then they can tell if it's too low that you have a low progesterone problem.

Absolutely DO NOT take the progesterone before ovulation.  [Here are some graphs](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity_Journal_of_Medicine/Reference_ranges_for_estradiol,_progesterone,_luteinizing_hormone_and_follicle-stimulating_hormone_during_the_menstrual_cycle) showing what progesterone and other hormones do during your cycle.  Progesterone is a post-ovulation hormone that gets your body ready to be a good host to a fertilized egg.  If you take it before you ovulate, your body will *not* ovulate, you will have basically just convinced your body that you already did ovulate, and then after 12 days you will have a period because it will mimic your body's own trail off of progesterone after the luteal phase.

That said, if you're having only an 8-10 day luteal phase, if you take the progesterone correctly, that should help lengthen your luteal phase a bit.  We have no way of knowing right now if you do actually have low progesterone since she didn't do labs at the right time, but at a minimum 12 days of progesterone should stave off your period by a little bit.

You can take it vaginally, I personally do and my RE tells me to, and it works just fine.

<p>If you used an OPK and you&#39;re having a 28 day cycle with a LH spike on day 22-25 I would venture so far as to say you&#39;re not ovulating at all and your body attempted an LH spike, failed to ovulate and you&#39;re having an estrogen withdrawl bleed.  This is very common in women with PCOS, which is also highly indicated with your LH/FSH ratio at almost 3:1.</p>

<p>As far as advice for now I&#39;d say don&#39;t take the progesterone until you&#39;ve confirmed ovulation with ovulation strips, and start searching for someone who will actually help diagnose and treat you for infertility.</p>

>ERA test findings have indicated that 20-25 percent of embryo transfers are happening too early or too late. In a pilot study, researchers gave the ERA test to 85 women who had each experienced on average five rounds of IVF that had failed at the implantation stage.

So of the x% of women who have 5+ failed transfers, 33% of them had successful implantation after the ERA test as a guide.  That's a huge leap of left-out information.

The idea is that Bromelain is a natural anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant.  Basically it's a natural baby aspirin.  So you can take your pick on using it.  Idea is, decrease inflammation that can disrupt the process of implantation, and allow for the best blood flow through the endometrial lining for easy sustenance of the trophoblast cells which eventually become the placenta.  

I used the following directions:
>For IVF: one pineapple, divided into 5 pieces. Consume one piece >each day for 5 days, beginning on the day of embryo transfer.
>For IUI: one pineapple, divided into 5 pieces. Consume one piece each >day for 5 days, beginning on the day of IUI.
>Time intercourse cycle: one pineapple, divided into 5 pieces. Consume >one piece each day for 5 days, beginning on the day after ovulation.

For future transfers in the event that this one doesn't happen to stick (3 is a high number to transfer :o  was there a reason you did three?  I can't even get my doc to transfer two as the risk of multiples is too great.  

Assisted Hatching is usually only used for Frozen Embryo Transfers in which they do a small snip to the shell which can harden in the freezing process.  Most of the time it's done at the discretion of the embryologist as far as I know.

Endometrial Scratching is usually done at I think CD-21 of the cycle.  The theory behind it is that the repair done by the body produces growth factors - a chemical thought to help with implantation and also something about gene switching which...  I don't know much about.  THIS SUCKS SO FUCKING MUCH!  I dunno maybe other people don't have an issue with it, but it's painful and I'd only ask to have it done if you're going in for a hysteroscopy under anesthesia.  I will say that having it done, your lining will be super lush the next cycle which if you have a thin lining can be helpful.  I just never want to experience that pain again.  

Something else I've been looking into, intrauterine injection of hcg.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3911962/ 
This study says that the implantation rate was significantly higher in their study.  That said, not all clinics do this...  mine wasn't opposed to it but the more I read it seems that it's more beneficial in those who have a history of thin lining.

<p>Your AMH does NOT mean you won&#39;t be successful.  You will find plenty of ladies over at <a href=""/r/infertilitybabies"">r/infertilitybabies</a> with as low and lower levels.  But I am concerned about your RE and how everything is being managed.</p>

My opinion as a fellow unexplained lady, would be to do PGS testing on the blasts.  It's not cheap, of course.  The reason I think that is because you and I need all of the data we can get.

But I wanted to share my experience that sometimes even after a lot of healthy test results,there may be further testing that can reveal more of what&#39;s going on. I hope you can figure out this mystery. </p>

But... truth is, doctors don't know why some people get pregnant and some people don't. They don't know how to guarantee someone gets pregnant. They can do some things to improve the odds, but ultimately it's a crap shoot.

What my RE theorizes is happening with me is that the FSH receptors in my ovaries are not functioning well. So they can give me all the drugs, and they don't respond. It's as if my ovaries are deaf, and no matter how loud the music is, they can't hear it and respond. There's nothing they can do about that. There's no definitive way to know for sure that this is happening, though.... it's only a best guess based on poor response and repeated failure.

My last RE actually gave up on me and told me to go with donor eggs. My new RE and I sat down and had a chat about odds, since having crap response means having crap odds at IVF.... he estimated mine to be about 5%-10%, which is not really much better than IUI or TI, both of which I've done and didn't work.

We made a decision to go ahead with IVF even with the crap odds and poor response, because it will hopefully at least yield some further information, and we can at least know for certain if something fertilized and grew or not.... reduces the variables. And we made an agreement that no matter the result, we would not cancel the cycle.... the reason is, we know ahead of time that I will not respond well, so if I get poor response, that's what's expected so we'll go ahead.  (We actually ended up doing natural cycle IVF, which is cheaper, since all the drugs and no drugs are the exact same result for me, so why spend the money?)

I would suggest talking to your doctor frankly about your response and what it means, and if it's worthwhile for you to pursue IVF (knowing that you'll likely have few eggs to work with), and if you still want to go ahead, that they will agree not to cancel the cycle even if the response is shit.

You don&#39;t always need expensive treatment so I would definitely recommend this step even if you cannot afford the most expensive treatments (IVF).</p>

In short, we're cautiously and very hopefully pregnant. But the shenanigans it took to get here... omg. I'll try to be brief, but it's kind of impossible so:

My husband was admitted to the hospital last month, and then sent home on IV antibiotics. A couple weeks after he finished those, he came down with a high fever and extreme pain again, so into the hospital he went! He stayed for 11 days this time and just came home on Monday. How does this affect my cycle? Well we were on Bravelle, 1 vial, for 7 days and when he was hospitalized we decided to stop taking it and basically scrap the cycle. Only I never got my period or ovulated, so I went back in to the RE's office to check on my follicles. They were totally at rest and hadn't responded. My husband was feeling better by this point, so we decided to resume trying- why not right? 5 more days on 1 vial, and then 7 more on 2 vials, and I finally had responded, with one dominant follicle on the right and another possible mature one on the left. 

We triggered on CD 32/ August 18, and I assume I ovulated on CD 34/August 20. My RE's office (which if you've read any of my prior posts, is NOT an amazing place) didn't do anything to follow up, confirm ovulation, or test progesterone levels, etc. I tested my trigger shot out using cheapies. On 10 and 11dpo, I somehow had very faint, but clear pink lines on tests, including the cheapie tests and an FRER. They were so faint though. Here's where it gets fun.

I asked for labs, so on 12dpo I had an HCG and progesterone test run, which came back at only 2.9 hcg and 1.16 progesterone. Obviously this doesn't correlate to the positive pregnancy tests, but that night I got my period so I figured I was out. The RE wanted me to repeat the test anyhow though, because while it was negative it wasn't ""negative enough."" I did the labs on 14dpo (Thursday) but Friday my husband was admitted to the hospital. I was already on my period so I just didn't even think about it. I called them on Friday to let them know I wasn't coming in for a baseline ultrasound. They didn't say anything about my labs. Saturday, they didn't call me either- but I noticed that they uploaded test results to my online patient portal. I just didn't have a chance to check it until Sunday night. Lo and behold, HCG came back at 17, progesterone at 0.73! I called the on call RE immediately, and she basically said this is most likely non-viable and if I were to take an HPT, there probably wouldn't even be a line at this point. So I took an FRER that night- nope- that line was CLEAR as day. I was kind of freaking out at this point, thinking what could be going on? Of course there weren't ANY labs open at all because Monday was Labor day, but I was able to drive up to my RE's office and get a 2-day supply of Endometrin.

Everyone in my doctors office at this point was baffled, but totally negative about this- saying it's likely ectopic or non-viable. Tuesday my labs (19dpo) showed that my HCG was 34, and progesterone was 13 (thank you supplements!) It wasn't a good doubling time at all, but hey, it did increase. 21dpo, HCG was 58, so the doubling time was improving. I came in for an ultrasound and more tests, and they weren't able to see anything (obviously... with levels that low, what would they even see?) That doctor was super negative and talked about ordered Methotrexate for me to take on Monday, pending results of my hcg coming back.

Well, HCG came back at 122 (23dpo) so it more than doubled in 48 hours, and progesterone was 16. At this point my RE FINALLY called me back. She was very negative but repeated that she didn't want any of us to rush into a decision to force a miscarriage we weren't comfortable with completely. She said she's 99.9% certain this would not end successfully, and it's 50/50 on whether it's an ectopic or chromosomal abnormal/non-viable. She instructed me to come in on Tuesday to see one of the REs who is supposedly very good at detecting early ectopics. Now this entire week, I've been walking around feeling like a ticking time bomb, completely scared that we'll have a second emergency situation on our hands at any second. It was horrible and so very stressful.

Tuesday morning I went in and the doctor looked very carefully. There was nothing in my tubes, but he did find a tiny little sac in my uterus!! He was very surprised. In fact, the whole office staff was surprised and pretty much baffled.My HCG came back at 297, but progesterone only at 7.

We're going with cautiously pregnant at this point, but honestly I'm SO relieved it's not in my tubes. I'll get labs done again, and go back next week at some point to see if we can find a heartbeat. My theory on this whole thing is that I had 2 mature follicles/eggs and both fertilized. One implanted early, and then didn't stick, so my body took the cue to shed lining and have a normal period. But at the same time, the other implanted. This would account for my positive tests before my beta came back at only 2.9, and would account for having such low progesterone now, where we really have to supplement to get the numbers back up! I think it's possible, and I don't see what other explanation there really could be! Anyway, that's where we are now. Just waiting and hoping this actually works out. I don't want to have anymore HCG labs drawn, but they're insistent that they want them. It doesn't do anything but stress me out honestly, maybe I'll just ask them to keep the results to themselves until/if we see a heartbeat so I can relax a bit.

Sorry so long, but as you can see, it's been a total drama!",[],,t1_cv4t045,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hi all- It&#39;s been quite a while since I updated on my crazy cycle. In short, we&#39;re cautiously and very hopefully pregnant. But the shenanigans it took to get here... omg. I&#39;ll try to be brief, but it&#39;s kind of impossible so:</p>

<p>My husband was admitted to the hospital last month, and then sent home on IV antibiotics. A couple weeks after he finished those, he came down with a high fever and extreme pain again, so into the hospital he went! He stayed for 11 days this time and just came home on Monday. How does this affect my cycle? Well we were on Bravelle, 1 vial, for 7 days and when he was hospitalized we decided to stop taking it and basically scrap the cycle. Only I never got my period or ovulated, so I went back in to the RE&#39;s office to check on my follicles. They were totally at rest and hadn&#39;t responded. My husband was feeling better by this point, so we decided to resume trying- why not right? 5 more days on 1 vial, and then 7 more on 2 vials, and I finally had responded, with one dominant follicle on the right and another possible mature one on the left. </p>

<p>We triggered on CD 32/ August 18, and I assume I ovulated on CD 34/August 20. My RE&#39;s office (which if you&#39;ve read any of my prior posts, is NOT an amazing place) didn&#39;t do anything to follow up, confirm ovulation, or test progesterone levels, etc. I tested my trigger shot out using cheapies. On 10 and 11dpo, I somehow had very faint, but clear pink lines on tests, including the cheapie tests and an FRER. They were so faint though. Here&#39;s where it gets fun.</p>

<p>I asked for labs, so on 12dpo I had an HCG and progesterone test run, which came back at only 2.9 hcg and 1.16 progesterone. Obviously this doesn&#39;t correlate to the positive pregnancy tests, but that night I got my period so I figured I was out. The RE wanted me to repeat the test anyhow though, because while it was negative it wasn&#39;t &quot;negative enough.&quot; I did the labs on 14dpo (Thursday) but Friday my husband was admitted to the hospital. I was already on my period so I just didn&#39;t even think about it. I called them on Friday to let them know I wasn&#39;t coming in for a baseline ultrasound. They didn&#39;t say anything about my labs. Saturday, they didn&#39;t call me either- but I noticed that they uploaded test results to my online patient portal. I just didn&#39;t have a chance to check it until Sunday night. Lo and behold, HCG came back at 17, progesterone at 0.73!

I even convinced myself that I wasn&#39;t going to bank too hard on ivf working, and yet after my first ivf (with pgd normal embryos, none left to freeze) failed, I was pissed. PISSED. And inconsolable for a good few days. I didn&#39;t know what more I could do, I felt like this was it, and I tried it and this was bullshit that I spent all this effort and money to basically get jack all. </p>

<p>A week later, I spoke to my doctor at the Wtf meeting and I also had a conversation with my acupuncturist who sees a lot of women going through infertility. They both had every reason to be optimistic for me (they said, anyway), and my re said that there were changes we could do to improve our favors for the next ivf cycle. I wasn&#39;t 100% sold but as time went on, I came around to it. My next egg retrieval with lupron added did go a lot better, my pgs yield went from 2 normal of 7 to 6 normal of 10. Since pgs required I freeze the embryos anyway, we left them frozen. We waited 2 months for my body to recover from the stim. I lost the bloat, adjusted my exercise and diet, felt more like myself, got my head in the game, etc. </p>

Your TSH looks a touch high- most REs want it below 2.5 for pregnancy.  What CD was your FSH taken?  If CD3, it looks really good.  You'll probably get more CD3 blood work done- AMH, FSH, estrodial.  Also, 7DPO progesterone.

The SA was a little confusing.  I think the first column is your male partner's results and the second was the average or minimum they want to see?  So it looks like his count is low- 28.3 million total sperm.  His motility and morphology for those sperm look good, though.  Male infertility factor (MFI) is not my area of expertise but I know for IUI the REs want at least a post wash number of 5 million, so you guys would meet that criteria easily.  

I would recommend getting a referral to a RE tomorrow.

Many medicated cycles include monitoring: instead of doing a daily urine test to pinpoint ovulation, the woman needs to visit the clinic for ultrasounds to watch when the IUI should be timed. That takes a lot of time and effort, and every ultrasound is an internal ultrasound which can range from traumatic to annoying depending on how women feel about a stranger inserting a probe into their vagina and poking it at their ovaries. 

Once the medicated cycle is ready for the IUI, the procedure itself is the same easy step. 

IVF can be similar to a medicated and monitored IUI cycle but with the addition of the egg retrieval, growth in vitro, and transfer. The woman is heavily medicated to a) produce lots of eggs, b) suppress ovulation until the clinic is ready, and c) trigger ovulation (expected to happen about 36 hours after a shot and carefully timed right to the hour). This is very carefully monitored with appointments; mine are every second day once we hit that stage.

I don't know about medicated IUIs, but when I am having my ovaries stimulated for IVF, I'm not allowed to go rock climbing (even with a special non-belly-shoving harness), jog, or even ride a bike. I get really fatigued, and eventually bloated enough that I can't wear my normal pants. I'm spending every second morning at the clinic (and commuting there and back). Life is definitely interrupted.  

Medications of all kinds for all medicated cycles can have side effects like fatigue, nausea, and irritability. Oh, the irritability. 

Once there are enough eggs and ovulation is triggered, the retrieval goes in and gets the eggs from the ovaries before ovulation actually occurs. The needle reaches the ovaries through the vaginal wall, guided by ultrasound. The retrieval is sometimes done under general anesthetic and sometimes under conscious sedation (just enough that you don't care that a needle is going through your vaginal wall). 

Retrieval is what really seriously sets IVF apart from medicated IUIs. It's surgery that requires that day and the next day off work. You can't drive yourself there or home. Retrieval can cause a problem called Ovarian HyperStimulation Syndrome where you get sick, bloated, and can have dangerous complications like stroke, although many women recover in a couple days. 

Although extremely rare, two members this week had internal bleeding from their retrievals. It was a bad week for this subreddit. 

Meanwhile, the eggs and sperm are either put together in a ""dish"" and fingers are crossed (IVF) or a technician actually injects a sperm into each egg (IVF with ICSI). First, there's no guarantee every egg retrieved was mature. Then, there's no guarantee that every egg+sperm with be actually fertilized (even with ICSI). Then, there's no guarantee that the embryos will continue to divide. This is a weird thing to learn; they're dividing but there is no guarantee they will survive. 

Depending on how well they are dividing and how healthy they look, they are grown to either Day 3, Day 5, or even Day 6. During this time, they can just start dying. 

It's not unheard of to retrieve 30 eggs and have 2 embryos after all that. 

Of course, you still have to get the embryos back into the uterus, but that's like the IUI procedure, with a small tube placing it/them there. Done. 

Extra embryos can be frozen. They have about a 90% chance of surviving being thawed, and if they do, pregnancy rates aren't different for Frozen Embryo Transfers (FET) than fresh transfers. 

So clearly, there is a giant chasm between unmedicated IUIs and IVF from the woman's perspective. Assuming a male partner is simply using masturbation to produce a sample, it's *exactly the same* from his. 

As for a year for a break, there's time to emotionally recover, and then there's just the glacial speed of treatment. The first six months were just the protocol and its fall out. We had 13 eggs retrieved, 11 mature, 9 fertilized, two still around on Day 3. They couldn't put one back because I had complications, so both were frozen. One month for IVF and OHSS, one month recovery, six weeks first FET, one month off, one month delay for our vacation, four weeks prep for the second FET, embryo did not survive. Actual time on the real calendar: September 30 - March 31st. 

Then six weeks until we could see the doctor, three months of IUIs so that I wouldn't lose my summer (I bike and travel a lot), one month off, now IVF again. March 31st to end of August. 

I hope that answers most of your questions :)

Medicated IUI: medication can help control the timing better, and can increase the number of eggs produced in a cycle. More eggs, more targets, better odds.  However, it's possible to over-respond and then the risk of twins or higher multiples goes up--carrying many babies is difficult and risky. 

IVF: If IVF goes well, it's very uncomfortable. There are daily injections, there are frequent (and invasive) vaginal ultrasounds and blood tests, and if you grow a lot of eggs, well, each egg is in a fluid-filled follicle that's grows to about an inch, and so imagine what it feels like to have 10 or more (sometimes 20 or more for people with PCOS) sitting in your balls.

Your count is good, and that's one of the hardest things to solve for.  I've seen on this sub that morph/motility can be improved with supplements,which take 3-6 months before any benefit can be seen.

I strongly recommend working with a urologist who specializes in male infertility (not all urologists have this specialty).  They can further diagnosis you, either with blood work to check out your hormone levels or a physical exam to look for things like varicoceles.

Based on your count and your wife's age, you probably have time to see if your numbers can be improved over the next 6-12 months.

I actually have a step daughter, but her mom isn&#39;t very compliant so we haven&#39;t seen her in a year. So it&#39;s hard to be a mom to a little one when you don&#39;t get to see them...</p>

<p>It&#39;s just difficult to not only see my friends graduate college and pursue that, but many of them have gotten pregnant and have had their babies. It&#39;s just difficult to be the odd one out...</p>

It attacked a pug in the small dog area. I helped break up the fight, but the owner wouldn&#39;t take the hint that his dog was too aggressive. It picked 2 more fights before going after our 7lb Yorkie. I grabbed our Yorkie fast and held the other little dog until his owner leashed him to leave. Owner admitted his dog hadn&#39;t been to the park before and had aggression issues.</p>

I have just dealt in the past with ""Well, obviously you don't *want* kids since you chose to have that surgery... Why are you so upset?"" When talking with ""friends"" about my struggle... Very frustrating.  I don't really share it with anyone anymore.. I moved to a new city so no one I know now was around when I had my surgery, so it makes it a bit easier.

My mother is supportive of it, but she focuses everything on herself.  In all aspects of life. She's very self-absorbed.  If her comments in this situation were just a one-off it wouldn't be on my radar, but our conversation was like this:

Her- ""Have you considered adoption?""

Me- ""Cost-wise, adoption an infant can be just as pricy as IVF, and we'd prefer to have a biological child if at all possible.""

Her- ""Well, I'll love a grandchild even if it is a goat.""

Me- ""depending on our finances, I'm not 100% sure there will be a grandchild.""

Her- ""That's okay too.""

Me- ""Well, not it's not okay.""

Her- ""I don't need a grandchild to be happy.""

Like, way to put focus on *you* getting a grandchild rather than the fact that *I want a child*. I am not getting pregnant to give you a grandchild.

Right now, with my chances being as low as they are, nothing feels worth it, but like you, I need to know the answers. I need to know for sure and I am determined to do whatever I can. The waiting is the worst part, every day feels like is drags, I hate it.

Agreeing with /u/whisgo.  I've been trying to explain this to myself and to my inner circle lately.  That's a great way of saying it.  I'm not mad at them for being pregnant.

<p>If I had been told the following things, I could have had fewer treatments: stop taking your vitamins immediately. Methotrexate works by asking the folic acid out of your system. Taking vitamins- especially your prenatals- just re-supplies your system with it.  I also drink a green drink and eat greens often (especially during the time of year that I had the treatments- since I eat local/ organic and that is what grows here then) which was also putting more folate in my system...

1. The sample sizes were very small.

2. I don't know if these results have been reproduced.

4. The effect was strong only for specific strains (expressing CagA).

Anyway, the way I see it, it's conceivable (but far from definite) that h.pylori is negatively affecting your fertility.

These methods haven't been shown to effectively eradicate h.pylori in a double-blind randomized controlled study (the ONLY type of reliable study when determining the efficacy of a treatment), whereas antibiotic treatment has been. If there's really a chance that h.pylori is contributing to your infertility, I'd say, go with the antibiotics - your chances are higher that you'll successfully eradicate the bacteria. And if you feel good on the diet and your doctor says it won't interfere with the treatment, you might as well continue with it too.

My RE literally suggested clomid on my very first appointment with her, before we had done any cycle monitoring or testing. She suggested it as a ""more aggressive option"". We politely declined her and said we wanted to proceed with the normal cycle monitoring for at least a cycle. She also suggested IUI after we found out my husband's sperm levels are sub-fertile. Umm, no thank you. Yes, we only need one sperm to make it work, but we could say the same thing about regular intercourse.

At the end of the day, you are paying for a service, so if you don't feel good about the service, definitely consider other avenues. If you feel rushed taking drugs, don't take the drugs. Ask for more natural cycle monitoring, have them nurses tell you when you are ovulating to better time sex, etc. At least for a couple of cycles.

Scrapping IVF is so stupid.  They could save millions, if not billions, if they overhauled the healthcare system to focus on outpatient treatments and early interventions; properly managing chronic health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, etc); and once the national prescription drug bulk buying takes effect.  I just can't believe how petty they are being.

There have been lots of studies of Clomid in men, but most of them are poorly controlled and have a small sample size so it's hard to know what to trust.

Keep in mind, HPT come in various sensitivities.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16295647

infertility treatments aside...  you would normally test on 14dpo because by all means that should be when your period is due/missed.  Some tests can detect as little as 15mIU/mL and you're also talking about seeing faint positives vs strong lines...  and on top of that not everyone has a strong value right off the bat.  Mine was a measily 7, obviously day before I tested using hpt and got nothing.  it was likely below the 6.3 which is it seems the lowest and FRER can test (maybe?).

I like the countdown calculator http://www.countdowntopregnancy.com/tools/pregnancy_test_calculator.php  

They mention 5dp5dt you can test, but you're also looking at an accuracy of 51%-69% and the accuracy does go up from there.  so 11dpo being 6dp5dt it's still potentially only 74%-83%...  and that is if you implant exactly on 9dpo - you could implant earlier or later...  and thus skew the values...  

Also with timed intercourse you have to factor in the time traveling through...  there's a hell of a lot going on in a transfer and being on a medicated cycle vs non medicated cycle or half or different hormone levels also factor into implantation.  For the record, I have auto immune issues and so implantation/embryo growth once implanted is a problem for me.  So that too can potentially screw with things.
