<p>Let&#39;s assume this cycle doesn&#39;t fail, but if you have to do another cycle maybe ask your RE if doing supplements for 6 months may make a difference in your case. I&#39;m talking about CoQ10, DHEA, some antioxidants, Vitamineral green etc.</p>

<p>Maybe changing the protocol would give you a better outcome?  </p>

My mom has many of the same health issues as you do, so I know how challenging they can be.  

If you've got PCOS with insulin resistance, I would recommend starting on metformin for a few months and seeing what that does to your cycles... you can track your basal body temperature at home to get an idea of ovulation and menstruation and without costing yourself a lot of cash.  If you go over to /r/PCOS, you can see a lot of folks' stories about metformin and what it'll do in terms of side effects.  Keep your doctor in the loop and s/he can help you adjust the medication to ensure it's doing its job.

I would also recommend starting a physical fitness and weight training program.  There are a few people in my family, including my mom, with fibromyalgia and chronic pain, including chronic nerve pain and nerve damage from severe physical trauma. Increasing physical strength and stamina has been a massive help to them in terms of pain management and also increasing their ability to do ADL (activities of daily life) with little or no assistance.  (Example: my mom used to need me to do most of the housework when I was a teen as she was in a lot of pain doing things like vacuuming (lugging it around, repetitive motions) or dusting that required her to move her arms above her head. She can do that stuff herself now on a daily basis.)  This would also help to prepare your body for pregnancy.  And, as an added bonus, it can really help to take the edge off of depression (depression during and after pregnancy is very real and can be extremely difficult to identify and manage).

Pregnancy can be incredibly physically challenging, so you will want to enter into it in the best shape you can be in.

As to the sperm donor plans, a few others have commented about the potential father not being able to waive his rights to parenthood and needing to pay support.  I would definitely check with a family lawyer to see what this option would entail.  I would also look into what it would cost for insemination with anonymous donor sperm.  Here (in Canada), the costs are not exorbitant and it could well be worth it to go anonymous to avoid messy legal arrangements that could negatively impact your friend.  It would also mean you could seek treatment closer to home without needing to travel.

So, you need to consider how exactly you're going to actually use a male donor be it a friend or someone else...  and even if it's a friend, you have to seriously consider the necessity of creating a contract for relinquishing ownership of his DNA like that.  and all the associated costs that comes with that.  How are you going to do that on SSI or SSDI?  Do you have someone to help with the financials of it...  

Also I will tell you as someone with a chronic illness, most if not all Reproductive Endocrinologists will not see you unless your existing condition is being addressed/monitored.  As someone with Lupus, I constantly have more blood work done...  and once IVF works and I get pregnant (if it works) I'll be considered high risk.  With your medical conditions you might be as well.  YOU NEED TO CONSULT WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING!  Before we went forward I consulted with a high risk OBGYN, my rheumatologist, a cardiologist...  

And really you need to have some type of support system in place - especially if you have chronic pain.  A friend, family member..  someone that can help you on the really bad pain days.  

And Consider how are you going to actually afford to take care of a child - I know disability payments don't provide much (my brother is on SSI) - and yes there are services like WIC and other state funded services available...  but even then that's not a lot.  

I'm not saying you shouldn't do this, but I'm saying you need to be realistic and have priorities.  The reality is, we're all looking at your history on reddit...   And you have some questionable issues that do make a lot of people concerned when it comes to wanting to have a kid.  

As for metformin and what it will do to your hormones...  honestly metformin won't do anything but good imo if you have PCOS and show insulin resistance.  It also helps many people with PCOS regulate their hormones...  and if you've got PCOS then regulating your hormones is what you need...  

As for the chronic pain, you won't be able to be on any pain medication if you become pregnant.  I had to stop all anti-inflammatories for my lupus...  And I have some shitty days...  but I also have a good support system in place with my husband and family.  ",[],,t1_cssotja,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Also, just something you might want to be aware of...  many infertility treatments are not covered by insurance.  So, you need to consider how exactly you&#39;re going to actually use a male donor be it a friend or someone else...  and even if it&#39;s a friend, you have to seriously consider the necessity of creating a contract for relinquishing ownership of his DNA like that.  and all the associated costs that comes with that.  How are you going to do that on SSI or SSDI?  Do you have someone to help with the financials of it...  </p>

<p>Also I will tell you as someone with a chronic illness, most if not all Reproductive Endocrinologists will not see you unless your existing condition is being addressed/monitored.  As someone with Lupus, I constantly have more blood work done...  and once IVF works and I get pregnant (if it works) I&#39;ll be considered high risk.  With your medical conditions you might be as well.  YOU NEED TO CONSULT WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING!  Before we went forward I consulted with a high risk OBGYN, my rheumatologist, a cardiologist...  </p>

<p>And really you need to have some type of support system in place - especially if you have chronic pain.  A friend, family member..  someone that can help you on the really bad pain days.  </p>

Please consider what will happen to your child if you get worse, more sick.  Will your parents, siblings be willing to take care of it?  Would it go into foster care?  


You absolutely have a right to carry a child if that's what you want.  I would just carefully think about every possible circumstance for when things don't go as planned.  Having support system while you go through the pregnancy and in those first few years is crucial.

Infertility doesn't mean sterility. But if you have been trying for a year, then by WHO definition, your couple is infertile. it suck, but that is what it is.

Tho, this study showed that there seems to be a link between obesity and low sperm count : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621293/ (But you don't precise if weight is an issue with your husband).

I googled how common being a carrier is and the answer depends on heritage. The most likely is a european descent with a 1 in 29 likelihood.  So your child has a 1 in 29 likelihood or less of being with someone who is also a carrier.  My understanding is that being a carrier means that your child will not be ill from CF, I hope I am correct in that.  I think education is extremely important.  If you child, who is a carrier, wants to make a baby with another carrier, IVF with PGD will be the best choice, unless new technology is available.  Right now that costs around $18k+, depending on the clinic and your child might need several rounds to make it work, or only one.  Perhaps you could start a fund for that possibility?  Then if he or she doesn't end up with a carrier, your kid has a down payment on a house or something.  In the end though, if most humans had the choice between existing with the 1 in d 29 possibility of needing IVF in the future or not existing, I believe most of us would chose existing.    

The second issue is that your child may experience the loss of a parent at a young age.  For me, personally, that is a harder question than the carrier issue.  It's great you are being thoughtful about it.  I wonder if there are support groups out there for CF and/or spouses of people with CF where you could explore the issue with others who are going through the exact situation.  Ultimately though, your and your husband lives have to be about more than CF.  You both deserve to live fully.  

Personally, I don't see having a biological child as any more or less selfish than if you fostered a child longterm.  That child will still see your husband as 'dad' and that child may lose his/her dad before other kids lose their parents.

Depending on what our physicians recommend, it may be better to ask for IUI while &quot;wrapping our heads around it&quot;, particularly if the physicians don&#39;t want to jump straight into in vitro stuff. </p>

<p>By the way, did you go straight for ICSI or did you consider straight IVF at all? And did you look at IMSI or PICSI? I don&#39;t know what our clinic will suggest, but part of me worries (perhaps irrationally) that sperm that can penetrate the egg on their own (i.e. IVF) might produce more viable embryos than injected ones (ICIS).</p>

The good news is that even if IUI doesn't work, you are making sperm and the morphology issues can easily be overcome with IVF-ICSI.  The bad news is that there is very little information about morphology and a lot of it is conflicting.

We have done two IUIs-the first flat out failed and I am currently in the 2WW of the second one.  Our RE has no hope for it-but we needed another SA and my insurance covers it so why not.  We are starting BCP for IVF-ICSI when this fails.

My husband has made a ton of lifestyle changes and they have helped.  He quit booze, saunas, hard workouts, and diet soda cold turkey.

I think if we stuck with these changes there would be a chance of conception happening naturally for us-but we don't want to take that gamble.

I think a few months of changes on your part maybe with a few IUIs is a conservative approach to take before diving headfirst into IVF.

Metformine did not really make me sick. Everyone is different, but in my case, there was bloating, discomfort, some ""I need to go to the bathroom right effing NOW"", a bit of nausea, but nothing too bad.

And indeed, I eat a normal diet, but then, we ate quite clean. Lot of veggie, lean proteins (from local farms). But I do have burgers and fries from time to time. Still have glass of wine. Still go craxy for homemade popcorn.
(Was worry about booze, but that is mostly for diabetics. I don't drink a lot, but a glass of wine with supper is nice, a nice cold micro-brew on a terrasse in the sunshine). 

If you have a normal weight, don't worry, you wont have to change a thing with Metformine.

Hope all will be good for you! Best of luck!

yup, sucks to be where we are...  osteopenia sucks, menopause sucks, infertility sucks.

So sure, this can be a sad frustrating devastating situation - but it's not as impossible as it always seems to be.  

Not contributing DNA can seem sad and discouraging, but you can find a donor that is somewhat similar at the very least.  I say this as someone who's super interested in genealogy and spent pretty much all weekend going through findagrave.com and looking up ancestor's grave markers to catalogue!

I have polycystic ovaries, but all my hormone levels were normal, I have none of the symptoms of PCOS. So, yeah, it's possible. If I remember correctly, they said it was ""ovaires d'aspect polykystic"" (so polycystic looking ovaries, which 20 % of women have).

Never really had issue with periods, always been regular (I thought I was not as it's always between 27 and 32 days, but doc told me that is indeed regular).

First clinic even never told me about it, when we switch clinic, that the first time I've hear about it. Freaky. They put me on Metformine, just to be sure.

The doctors at the new clinic were not really bother by it, just told me I will probably produce lot of eggs with the stimulation (and we had to decide what to do with them if they can't find much sperm with the micro-TESE (also MFI, but genetic condition).

So, Metformine. I havent loose weight, I'm on it since end of april I think? And 3 dose per day since maybe mid-may? But I'm 5'7 and 135 lbs, so I have a ""normal weight"".

Clean eating (lot of fresh veggies, fruits, lean proteins) and exercise will also help. Take long walk, use the bike, take the stairs instead of elevator, little things like that will help.

Just like you, we've also had the time to sit back and watch the parenting dynamics of our friends.

We can see the mistakes others have made and will make a conscious effort not to get sucked into that mindset or style of parenting.  If we can't get pregnant, well, we'll provide the best we can for fostered or adopted children in the future.

For me, I think the positives will feel much more positive when we've reached our goal.  There *are* benefits if I squint, but it's hard for me to squint at them right now. 

A situation I've been thinking about lately: A couple years back we went looking for a house.  We are very picky about what we wanted in a house, plus the housing market here is ridiculous.  After looking for six months we finally found a house we *really* loved, and we put in a bid, and stressed out about it for days waiting for the phone call, wondering if our life was about to go This Way or That Way.  (Hmmm.)  We ended up being outbid by only a few thousand dollars and we were really upset.  At the time our realtor told us ""the house you do end up with will make up for the house you didn't get,"" and we reacted to that about like you'd expect.  We were pissed off for awhile, then we started thinking about our plan, and we actually ended up building a house with the guy who built the house we loved.  It's a *way* better house than that first house in *many* ways, and we are very happy with how things turned out.  But it's only now that we've actually reached that goal that I can look back at losing the first house and go ""Yep, we *were* headed for something better, that disappointing experience was part of the journey and without it we wouldn't be here.""  When we were looking at having to restart the house search and wait another six months to maybe run across a house we might like as much, I couldn't see the benefits at all.

I think kids are going to be like that -- once we actually have one, we'll be able to say ""Everything we went through was worth it,"" and reflect on how it *did* make our relationship better (I already know it has, even though there have been many shitty moments), and has made us better parents (absolutely), and so on.  Still, right now my frame of mind is more on ""I did not really need an extra round of learning experiences, and relationship challenges, and more time to reflect on why we want to be parents right now, in order to be sufficiently grateful for our as yet imaginary kid(s).""

Essentially, they are the same as follicles, except that if it's a cyst it does not contains an egg (either because it never did, or it's a leftover from the last cycle and it didn't 'resolve itself' and go away after releasing the egg.)  Think of it as a follicle gone wrong.

What to do about it can be tricky, because suppressing the cysts also suppresses follicle growth.  Similarly, stimulating follicle growth also stimulates cysts.  Note that they can't really tell what is a cyst and what is a follicle--they assume something is a cyst because size/estrogen level doesn't make sense for where you are in your cycle.

We are in the same boat, my husband also have a balanced translocation. But also, so low sperm count there the chance of me ever getter pregnant are.... astronomically low. I got a plus over a year ago, but then few day later, bye bye..... since nothing.

For the chance, it all depend on the translocation and the chromosone affected.

In our case, it's 2 and 13. No chance at all to carry a pregnancy to term with trisomy 2, but it is with trisomy 13, altho, it will shortly died. 

have you meet with a geneticist to get a fully explanation of the translocation, the risk and etc?

Statistically, you have 50% chance of a ""normal"" embryo (either with a balanced translocation or totally normal).

For us, it will be IVF with ICSI and PGD. The PGD is about 2100$ for up to 8 embryos, so at least, we will know before if there abnormal embryo. 

If you take the cost in perspective, your chance are as good with your husband sperm and PGD then with a donor embryo.

If that don't work, we will consider donor sperm. Or just live child free.

Good luck.

<p>Since then, I&#39;ve really changed my opinion of myself; I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a big enough person to adopt because I&#39;d be so anxious about them being damaged by the circumstances that led to them being put up for adoption. Even if I could get an infant, and there are basically none of them, AND my therapist said that we are too young to get picked (although I haven&#39;t talked to any agencies about that yet), I&#39;d still be worried about how safe the pregnancy was. It&#39;s not like the birth mother was on prenatals for 3 months leading up to conception, and probably didn&#39;t even know for the first month of pregnancy. </p>

And I was an unusual thirteen year old and basically we co-parented. When I was 18 we got a set of siblings (4mo, 2.5 and 6) which we had for three-ish years then adopted. They were supposed to go home (as in we thought we'd have them for a few weeks, a month tops) and they for a series of reasons they didn't go home and eventually ended up having their parental rights terminated. Then we adopted them and stopped doing foster care because, hello, three kids!

First, I want to say that your expectations are way, way off the mark in my experience. But here's lesson one about foster care: **every state, every county, does it very differently**. What your county will do is completely different than my experience so don't expect what I'm saying to be some kind of grand authority. 

**First of all** there's no such thing as a placement that lasts less than a month in most circumstances. What you're talking about there is respite care. That means you provide a free weekend, sometimes a free week, sometimes just a night off, for people who have foster kids as placements. You wouldn't be the foster mom, more like a babysitter. It's a very rewarding thing but you're not going to get a full month.

Basically, think about three levels: 

* Emergency care/Respite care: We need a bed TONIGHT and we'll figure out what we're doing tomorrow/next week
* Short Term: these placements last between six months and two years on average. The goal of a short term placement is family reunification. You're basically keeping the kid while the state acts as a go-between with the biological family to resolve issues that are required to reunite the family
* Long-term: this is for kids that will likely age out of the system. They are placed with a family that will keep them, but not adopt them, until they age out. 

**Second problem**: your age range is really tight. It is unlikely you'd be offered placements for a single kid in that age range. You will, however, get a lot of calls about six and ten year olds. Young kids are out there, but they usually come with siblings and everyone wants the babies but no one wants the eight year olds. They simply are unlikely to have kids in that age range to give you, and they REALLY won't give them to you if you only want them for a month. They'll preference either short-term homes that can keep them through the reunification process or long-term adoption-based homes if they think the parental rights are going to be terminated. 

If you want young, young kids there are two good ways to do it: pregnant teen moms and sibling groups. They always need people who will take in three-four kids at a time. It does happen that a mom loses and infant, even a two-year-old, but is super rare. Kids that end up in foster care are older. Mostly because it often takes the school system to report issues, most people who give up kids have more than one before the signs are noticed, and moms who repeatedly get pregnant without parenting skills will have their infants pulled but they'll be given in preference to people who already have adopted or have placement of a sibling. There simply aren't two-year-olds without siblings very often. There are, however, about a billion sixteen year olds looking for a bed and a home. 

**Here's my point**: there are a billion people out there who would like an infant, a toddler, but they just don't end up in foster care often. When they do, they come with a fifteen year old mom or a bunch of siblings they are trying to keep together. You might get lucky, but chances are good you'll either get called for the seven year old a couple times a week until your social worker just stops calling you or they won't call you at all. 

**But let me say this**: This shouldn't stop you from wanting to foster children. It is an incredible experience, totally worthwhile, and something dear to my heart. I am just trying to level with you about the truth of it. If you can be flexible (longer placements, older kids) you can really make a huge, immense difference. Don't take what I am saying as negative, just realistic. You *might* get what you're looking for, but the odds aren't in your favor. But trust me, when they drop off the terrified seven year old you don't miss the toddler, if you know what I mean. 

I could get into the individual difficulties of the kids you can get but I won't. I just wanted to give you a picture of what the process was like for us. Ask me **any** questions and I'll do my best to answer. 

",[],,t1_cshh1gt,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>My mom and I became a placement home for foster kids when I was 13. And I was an unusual thirteen year old and basically we co-parented. When I was 18 we got a set of siblings (4mo, 2.5 and 6) which we had for three-ish years then adopted. They were supposed to go home (as in we thought we&#39;d have them for a few weeks, a month tops) and they for a series of reasons they didn&#39;t go home and eventually ended up having their parental rights terminated. Then we adopted them and stopped doing foster care because, hello, three kids!</p>

<p>First, I want to say that your expectations are way, way off the mark in my experience. But here&#39;s lesson one about foster care: <strong>every state, every county, does it very differently</strong>. What your county will do is completely different than my experience so don&#39;t expect what I&#39;m saying to be some kind of grand authority. </p>

<p><strong>First of all</strong> there&#39;s no such thing as a placement that lasts less than a month in most circumstances. What you&#39;re talking about there is respite care. That means you provide a free weekend, sometimes a free week, sometimes just a night off, for people who have foster kids as placements. You wouldn&#39;t be the foster mom, more like a babysitter. It&#39;s a very rewarding thing but you&#39;re not going to get a full month.</p>

<p>Basically, think about three levels: </p>

<ul>
<li>Emergency care/Respite care: We need a bed TONIGHT and we&#39;ll figure out what we&#39;re doing tomorrow/next week</li>
<li>Short Term: these placements last between six months and two years on average. The goal of a short term placement is family reunification. You&#39;re basically keeping the kid while the state acts as a go-between with the biological family to resolve issues that are required to reunite the family</li>
<li>Long-term: this is for kids that will likely age out of the system. They are placed with a family that will keep them, but not adopt them, until they age out. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Second problem</strong>: your age range is really tight. It is unlikely you&#39;d be offered placements for a single kid in that age range. You will, however, get a lot of calls about six and ten year olds. Young kids are out there, but they usually come with siblings and everyone wants the babies but no one wants the eight year olds. They simply are unlikely to have kids in that age range to give you, and they REALLY won&#39;t give them to you if you only want them for a month. They&#39;ll preference either short-term homes that can keep them through the reunification process or long-term adoption-based homes if they think the parental rights are going to be terminated. </p>

<p>If you want young, young kids there are two good ways to do it: pregnant teen moms and sibling groups. They always need people who will take in three-four kids at a time. It does happen that a mom loses and infant, even a two-year-old, but is super rare. Kids that end up in foster care are older. Mostly because it often takes the school system to report issues, most people who give up kids have more than one before the signs are noticed, and moms who repeatedly get pregnant without parenting skills will have their infants pulled but they&#39;ll be given in preference to people who already have adopted or have placement of a sibling. There simply aren&#39;t two-year-olds without siblings very often. There are, however, about a billion sixteen year olds looking for a bed and a home. </p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s my point</strong>: there are a billion people out there who would like an infant, a toddler, but they just don&#39;t end up in foster care often. When they do, they come with a fifteen year old mom or a bunch of siblings they are trying to keep together. You might get lucky, but chances are good you&#39;ll either get called for the seven year old a couple times a week until your social worker just stops calling you or they won&#39;t call you at all. </p>

I am just trying to level with you about the truth of it. If you can be flexible (longer placements, older kids) you can really make a huge, immense difference.

<p>...and, the level of sadness toward my panties lets you know that I&#39;m also menstruating and getting oddly emotional...</p>

lastly, i noticed you mentioned that testicular sperm may have better quality. speak thoroughly with your urologist. at your center, is this proven? testicular sperm is much more difficult to perform ICSI with. make sure your facility has experience in this aspect before diving in on a hunch.

With yoga, even if you're doing a low-intensity yin practice, there's bending over and being inverted, and I honestly didn't feel comfortable putting myself in any position where my ovaries might twist up. 

Now it's one day past my retrieval, and I'm getting the gym urge again. I couldn't make it today, but I would've gone. I feel totally fine after my RE. I plan on resuming my elliptical sessions at the gym tomorrow, then I'll ask about what to do in the TWW at the transfer. But probably no yoga until at least my beta because I don't want to be folding over myself or doing any inversions. My acupuncturist, who I've been working with for six months, agrees with this plan.

It sucks because I'm married to a chef. And I have been eating a high protein diet because my doctor recommended it to deal with the retrieval and stuff. And my chef has been stuffing me with cheese and salumi and sushi and stuff I may not be able to eat soon. So, on top of the bloating from stimming and the retrieval, I feel like my diet has really tanked and the bulge is creeping up on me.

I'm sure your doctors also waited those three weeks because your HCG levels may have been rising steady enough to be considered doubling - could you imagine them pulling the plug, so to speak, on a pregnancy that may have actually been viable?  As pessimistic as you may have felt, your doctors needed to be cautious.  

If I may provide some perspective with my own experience and the frustration of waiting...I got pregnant a year ago in May with a baby boy after only 2-3 months of fertility treatment.  Our first actual IUI worked (we had a cycle with a canceled IUI because I didn't respond well to Clomid; Femara did the trick).  I was due this February. Unfortunately, I gave birth to my son Ethan at only 22 weeks gestation in October for reasons completely unrelated to infertility.  Devastated is not the word.  

Since my loss, we were able to get back to trying in December.  We figured the road to a subsequent pregnancy would be easier than the year-ish we spent getting pregnant the first time around because we knew what worked.  Not so: 
*December: fertility doc recommend trying on our own for one cycle just to see if my cycles regulate (that cycle was better, I ovulated by myself, but it was long and there was no pregnancy)
*January: Another cycle with no meds, but with monitoring to confirm that treatment was necessary (similar to December)
*February: Tried 2.5 mg of letrozole - half the doze that worked last year - and IUI.  My response wasn't quite as good, but we got a mature-ish follice and a well-ish timed IUI.  
*March: Negative beta becomes a 5 (what?!) during my CD3 bloodwork AFTER I got my period.  Became a 6, resolved itself less than a week later.  Doc called it a legit false positive, but while we waited for it to resolve I couldn't take letrozole.  We monitored and timed intercourse well, but I ovulated bizarrely early that cycle (CD 12) - we didn't catch the egg in time for an IUI and have no idea who big or mature that follicle was.  In retrospect, we may have in fact had a chemical pregnancy that really threw things off. 
*April-May: That follicle became my suspected ectopic.  
*June: Period returned June 8.  We did 5 mg of letrozole and I've responded great again. I had my IUI today.  First the first time ever, my husband's count was pretty low, so we're going to try repeating IUI tomorrow and hope for the best.  

Basically...I'm now nine months out from my loss almost and I feel like we've gotten maybe one legitimately good try in, maybe 0 if you count the fact that I don't know what the husband's numbers will be tomorrow if if this month will pan out.  As each month has passed the plan has always made sense to me and seemed like the right thing to do, but in retrospect it feels like I've spent so much time pedaling hard on a bike that won't go anywhere.

It dropped to about 50 or 60 on its own before it rose again, hence the injection.  

My injection happened two days before Mother's Day - brilliant timing.  I started cramping and bleeding ON Mother's Day, and that bleed lasted a little over a week.

It's becoming more common for people to pool their embryos for 2-3 cycles to test them for genetic issues (PGD/PGS) before they transfer the embryo to the womb.  With that being said they need more than one cycle to pool them.  Some RE's recommend taking a month of in between some go right into the second cycle. It all depends on your body and how you react to meds and stimming.

The only thing I can think of is to make sure your doctor is conservative on your results.  I heard of doctors who stimulate young woman to get as many eggs as possible and then they end up with horrible [OHSS](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome-ohss/basics/symptoms/con-20033777).  It's important that you talk to your doctor about it and set some expectations on that end.

I hope you find a solution that works for you and your family.  Paying for everything out of pocket is brutal but all worth it if it works!  Bets of luck!

<p>My personal outcome has been disappointing so far. I&#39;ve done two unsuccessful rounds of IVF, but we&#39;re also pretty unhappy with our RE and are in the process of switching clinics. I had a terrible rate of egg maturity (10 eggs retrieved last cycle with only 3 mature) and we suspect/hope the protocol is to blame. </p>

<p>I hope your RE has some good answers for you this week. I know it must be really scary right now for you, I&#39;m thinking of you.  </p>

I mean, there are actual support groups here for white parents of black kids (for example) because society is so mean to kids in these families. After a couple of hours of the agency randomly revisiting this topic and making us feel like racists (we're an interracial couple), they wore us down and we said ok, any race, no big!

This is one example. It was awful.  

I'm not saying I'd never adopt, but after that, I honestly swore off pursuing it for a few years.

I mean sure, it would still be my husband's baby, but it would not be mine.

To some degree, it makes a lot of sense for me to pursue adoption, since I don't feel a strong need to experience pregnancy or childbirth. And I like children over babies, which, realistically, makes adoption considerably more viable.  But speaking very honestly, I do not know that I, personally, would truly bond with an adopted child. I do not know that I would be able to cope with issues arising owing to children being initially raised in unstable environments. I don't know if I, personally, would feel like I was mothering adopted children or simply taking care of them.

I do think that some of this might be different if we were adopting an infant in that I think I could form that bond, but from the little bit I've learned about adoption where I live, it's not realistic for us to adopt an infant.  Given that, though, we don't have to make an adoption decision one way or another yet, so exploring the answers to some of these questions isn't something I've really had to do yet.

On the other hand, and maybe this sounds arrogant, I do think my husband and I are unique people. We come from unique people. I'd like to see that carry on. I have a very strong sense of legacy these days, and to me, carrying forward my genes is a big part of that.

I do know that my husband is more in favour of donor eggs than adoption. I probably lean towards adoption over donor eggs.  He tends to underestimate what we can do and I tend to overestimate, though.

This is such a stressful situation and time, and I am the first one to admit that I had legit ugly crying over the fear of IVF at the start.  But, breathe!

I went through 1 round of fresh IVF, and one FET.   I'm assuming you're attributing the craziness to the medications?  Or just the process? Because, in our case, neither happened.  The fresh IVF took about 8 weeks from start of BCP to transfer date.  At the time, I did not have to do progesterone shots, so I did my own shots, but my husband was more than willing to help if needed.  The birth control made me feel kind of icky, but never out of control, mentally or physically.  The only issue I had was the suppression drugs, but again, not mental, just physical.  

During the FET, I was on progesterone shots, and my husband did those.  Nightly shots in my butt, and he never flinched or made a fuss.  He was more concerned that he was hurting me. 

I should say, we've had our fair share of arguments in life.  And even during treatments.   Our biggest fights were during ""off-times"" when we were between treatments and unsure of how to proceed.  And then there was some minor discussion on divorce after a miscarriage.  But, IVF itself was never the cause for any marital heat.

I was TERRIFIED of IVF at the start of all this.  The drugs, the time away from work, the driving to the clinic, etc.  But as treatments failed, and time dragged on, IVF became our saving grace.  We were completely fine with how things progressed as we got closer to IVF.  (And we're still married now!!)  Just make sure you guys communicate.  You have to understand his fears, as much as you want him to understand yours.  You're both allowed to be scared, and hurt, and confused.  If we learned anything through IVF, it was that.  It's not anyone's job to ""be strong for the other person."" Help your partner up, but make sure to let them know that you need help too!  But, maybe this will be all you need to be get where you'd like to be!

The funny thing is that the thing that set it off was redoing our backyard.

We bought our house last year and we love it, but one of the compromises was the backyard.  The backyard flooded often because of the grading and all that standing water basically killed the privacy bushes, and a tree in the middle of the yard was damaged and dying.   Where the flooding didn't affect the yard was a big garden and the yard was small to begin with.  It felt dark, but it was very private and shady.

We always planned to fix the drainage and see if we could clear away the heavy foliage to get more grass.  We both had nice backyards when we were kids and wanted that for our kids someday.  So we pulled the trigger, hired a really awesome landscaper, and they redid a 2,000 sq ft backyard in a day and a half.

It came out exactly what we hoped for...so why is my anxiety about my backyard coiling around me like a snake, continuing to tighten around me and it won't let go?

One reason is now we have zero privacy.  Since the flooding killed the old bushes, we pulled them out and put new ones in.  We also planted a new tree to replace the dying one.  But obviously, they're not full grown.  It's overwhelming that I didn't think about that aspect.  That makes me feel stupid.

The other issue is that if treatment doesn't work and we never have kids then we ""wasted"" good money making a family friendly yard that we'll never use.  The updated backyard is like a specter of impending failure outside my bedroom window.  (I say ""wasted"" because we did have big drainage problems that needed to be fixed regardless of our parenting status.)

So I'm super freaked out.  I've always been an anxious person, but even while dealing with IF I've had a really placid, even mellow, six months.  We've decided not to do any other transformative projects with the house for awhile.  I feel guilty that SquirrelBoy has to deal with my anxiety issues, but he's great about it.

I've spent the last two and a half years struggling to prevent this shit from changing me.  Each cycle was, in part, a desperate hope that this time I'd get pregnant because if I got pregnant this time, maybe... MAYBE... I'll be okay.  Maybe I won't always have the ugly scars.  I could feel myself struggling with all of those feelings and pushing against it, feeling like I was just barely treading water, and panicking when I felt the water start to lap at my chin.  I wanted to be normal.  I wanted to be able to emerge from this crisis like I had every other crisis in my life- whole, pink, unscarred, able to find the silver lining, able to find the meaning.  Well, I just had a horrible failure of an IVF cycle and the water closed over my head.  I will never be normal.  I will never be free of these scars.  I'm like a burn victim now, I will always have those pale reminders of this experience no matter how successful things end up being.  But with surrender has come peace.  I've stop struggling to be unchanged which has lightened my burden because *I am changed*.  I imagined that if I had 5 frozen PGS normal embryos, I'd be normal again- like have a good chance of being able to have the three kids we'd always wanted.  Well, that's probably not going to happen.  I don't get normal.  ""Let go or be dragged,"".  Well, I've finally let go of the idea of normal.  I've let go of the idea I'll get to choose my family size or the way it happens.  You think you can't let go but it's either let go or be dragged.  You don't get another option here.  

Yes, infertility will leave a mark.  

“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.

An you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.

And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.” 
― Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore",[],,t1_csc35xa,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot lately because I feel like I&#39;ve just been through a paradigm shift.  I&#39;ve spent the last two and a half years struggling to prevent this shit from changing me.  Each cycle was, in part, a desperate hope that this time I&#39;d get pregnant because if I got pregnant this time, maybe... MAYBE... I&#39;ll be okay.  Maybe I won&#39;t always have the ugly scars.  I could feel myself struggling with all of those feelings and pushing against it, feeling like I was just barely treading water, and panicking when I felt the water start to lap at my chin.  I wanted to be normal.  I wanted to be able to emerge from this crisis like I had every other crisis in my life- whole, pink, unscarred, able to find the silver lining, able to find the meaning.  Well, I just had a horrible failure of an IVF cycle and the water closed over my head.  I will never be normal.  I will never be free of these scars.  I&#39;m like a burn victim now, I will always have those pale reminders of this experience no matter how successful things end up being.  But with surrender has come peace.  I&#39;ve stop struggling to be unchanged which has lightened my burden because <em>I am changed</em>.  I imagined that if I had 5 frozen PGS normal embryos, I&#39;d be normal again- like have a good chance of being able to have the three kids we&#39;d always wanted.  Well, that&#39;s probably not going to happen.  I don&#39;t get normal.  &quot;Let go or be dragged,&quot;.  Well, I&#39;ve finally let go of the idea of normal.  I&#39;ve let go of the idea I&#39;ll get to choose my family size or the way it happens.  You think you can&#39;t let go but it&#39;s either let go or be dragged.  You don&#39;t get another option here.  </p>

<p>Yes, infertility will leave a mark.  </p>

<p>“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn&#39;t something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn&#39;t get in, and walk through it, step by step. There&#39;s no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That&#39;s the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.</p>

<p>An you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You&#39;ll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.</p>

<p>And once the storm is over you won&#39;t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won&#39;t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won&#39;t be the same person who walked in. That&#39;s what this storm&#39;s all about.”

Our embryos were described as slow...I've mentally kind of decided this was an egg quality thing (not that I have any proof of this, but it's the only thing I can sort of hang my hat on).  

Due to travel plans, we are waiting until August to start another IVF cycle and in the meantime I am doing this: 

* increase protein intake to at least 25% and keep carbs under 40% (there is *one* study that supports this), targeting at least 80 grams of protein per day, often more, with total food around 1600cal/day.  I have to track everything I eat to do this which makes me insane, and I miss eating rice and pasta in the quantities I prefer, but I can do this for a few months.  I'm getting most of my carbs from fruit and beans and avoiding most of the simple ones.  The reason I'm hopeful about this one is I looked back at some old food tracking data and my typical diet is pretty crap on the protein.  10-15% of my calories most days.  Whoops.  

* I mentioned DHEA, melatonin, myo-inositol, and CoQ10 to my RE and he said it can't hurt to try the myo-inositol and the CoQ10.  Those are pretty painless, though I'm kind of meh on the myo-inositol -- it's a mostly tasteless powder you mix into a glass of water twice a day.  The evening glass I use to take my prenatals and fish oil and vitamin D and CoQ10 (sigh) but the morning glass is a bit of a chore.  Also, the supplement is called Pregnitude and I find that name totally asinine. 

* 20 minutes of moderate exercise four or five times a week.  I used to do zero minutes of exercise all the times of the week.  Been meaning to do this anyway, so.  

* Next cycle we are converting to long lupron protocol.

I hate that I have no idea if any of this is really going to help, but I guess it's the only thing I *can* do right now, and most of it has fringe benefits for my overall health or whatever, so it's good to give it a shot.

Reasons to do PGS:

* You can put back one verified normal one and feel pretty good about it, instead of guessing at whether you should put back more based on the odds of something being abnormal (extra transfer cycles also cost $)

* If you do have extras, you get insight on them too, so if you are lucky enough to get pregnant, you don't spend the next few years wondering if the embryos in the freezer are abnormal or are viable future siblings.  (And if none of them are normal, I suppose you can avoid paying freezer fees -- though those are a lot less than PGS.)

Reasons not to do PGS:

* At your age your eggs are *probably* more OK than mine are at 36

* $$$ -- for both the biopsy and the testing 

* PGS normal doesn't guarantee success.  I had to learn that one the hard way, 70% success still leaves room for 30% failure.  

* There's a bit of new research coming out that sometimes the cells they biopsy for PGS aren't representative of the entire embryo, so apparently you can have some false positives on things being labeled abnormal.  That's scary.

Have you ever had his urine tested for sperm?

So glad that this works for you guys! We are thinking about trying Sudafed in the coming weeks since I found out yesterday that I should be having all of my pre-IVF testing as soon as I get my period (CD60.... but I did ovulate last week so hopefully soon!).

Either way, if you are cycling/running for very long distances, that can be very stressful to the body.

For a chart of what I'm about to describe, I'll refer you to [this website](http://metabolichealing.com/wp-content/uploads/Post-The-Endocrine-Journey-1.jpg).  They have the same training as I do (Functional Diagnostic Nutrition).

The normal process for steroidal hormones is Pregnenolone - DHEA - Testosterones/Estrogens and Pregnenolone - Progesterone - Cortisol.  When you're under a no stress or a 'normal' amount of stress, this process is stable and balanced.  However, when you introduce a new stressor, say a tiger chasing you, your body will divert some extra pregnenolone to make more cortisol until that stressor is gone.  

What is now becoming common is that people are under constant stress (work, kids, poor diet, too much exercise, mental/emotional...) and their body is interpreting it like they are constantly being chased by a tiger so they have to keep pumping out cortisol.  After time, this can become the preferred pathway for your hormones (the red arrows on the chart).  When this happens, the hormonal supply for DHEA can get severely reduced, which means that the supply to make testosterone and estrogen are also reduced, and as you know, estrogen plays a key roll in the menstrual cycle.  What can also happen is all of the extra progesterone (pro-gestation hormone) that is getting created gets converted into cortisol to handle the chronic stress.  Progesterone also plays a roll in the menstrual cycle.  What can also happen with the progesterone is that it can be converted into androstenedione, then testosterone and estrogen.  

Everybody is different and their bodies will react differently to stress, but this is typical for a lot of people.  Some people will be able to convert progesterone into androstenedione very will, others won't.  Some people will be able to make extra cortisol while also making a lot of DHEA, but it won't all get converted into testosterone/estrogen.  There is a lot of biochemical individuality that has to be taken into account for each person.
