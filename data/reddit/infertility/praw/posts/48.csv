I went for monitoring this morning. I am ready to trigger and my clinic told me to take my cetrotide this morning, my trigger tonight (GnRH agonist, like lupron), AND my cetrotide **again** tomorrow morning. I will have egg retrieval on Thursday.

I feel like the cetrotide tomorrow counteracts the agonist trigger tonight. Cetrotide suppresses the pituitary from releasing FSH/LH. The trigger is supposed to encourage the pituitary to release a large surge of LH. Aren't these doing the opposite? I'm very worried about this, and I was already worried about the agonist trigger working anyway. The only explanation I can come up with is if the trigger acts very quickly, and my 9am the next morning, the trigger has already ""worked"".

No antagonist protocol I've ever seen continues the antagonist after the trigger.

Any insight here guys? I'm having the nurse ask my doctor when he gets in this morning and she'll get back to me today. Thanks.

Edit: so the nurse got back to me. She asked my doctor and the answer is basically ""we've figured out over time that this is the best way to do it to avoid premature ovulation."" She told if I'm uncomfortable taking the cetrotide tomorrow, that I can not take it, but I won't be doing that. I can't risk prematurely ovulating. Just have to trust them I guess...

I&#39;m very worried about this, and I was already worried about the agonist trigger working anyway. The only explanation I can come up with is if the trigger acts very quickly, and my 9am the next morning, the trigger has already &quot;worked&quot;.</p>

<p>No antagonist protocol I&#39;ve ever seen continues the antagonist after the trigger.</p>

<p>Any insight here guys? I&#39;m having the nurse ask my doctor when he gets in this morning and she&#39;ll get back to me today. Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit: so the nurse got back to me. She asked my doctor and the answer is basically &quot;we&#39;ve figured out over time that this is the best way to do it to avoid premature ovulation.&quot; She told if I&#39;m uncomfortable taking the cetrotide tomorrow, that I can not take it, but I won&#39;t be doing that. I can&#39;t risk prematurely ovulating. Just have to trust them I guess...</p>

<p>Edit2: thank you all for your replies. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you guys... I would go completely insane. I think I just need to keep calm and do some guided meditation or something.</p>

I've never been a very active person, but I've read in a few different places to not start a new exercise routine when you're trying to get pregnant. So for the past almost three years I've done very little if any. We did IVF in February and so far have had two failed transfers and one miscarriage. After my miscarriage I started doing 30 day shred since we were taking a break and attending my sister in laws wedding. I kept up with it for about a month and then I stopped exercising in the weeks leading up to my next transfer, just to be safe. The transfer was a fail. 
I'm getting sick of the extra weight and I just want to be in shape. I don't want to lose weight and be lean, I just want to be healthy. 
So what exercise is ""safe"" to do leaving up to a transfer? Is the 30 day shred too intense for someone doing a transfer? I don't go full out with the moves. And I know you shouldn't be lifting weight after a transfer. But what's safe to be doing before/during/after a transfer?

Hi Reddit,

I'm Alan Horsager, CEO of Episona. I wanted to share with you that Episona's sperm DNA test, Seed, is now available for online purchase at www.episona.com, throughout the U.S. and Canada, for $495. We mail you a test kit, you can collect your sample at home, and mail it back into our lab. When results are ready you can discuss them with a genetic counselor, as well as share them with your doctor.

Through 11/30/17 you can use coupon code REDDIT for 10% off your purchase. You can learn more about our test here: http://info.episona.com/hubfs/Discount_for_Reddit.pdf

Seed is a sperm test that gives you new information into sperm's contribution to embryo development and highlights specific genes where we see abnormalities. Our test is already being used in over 40 clinics in the U.S. and Canada to help doctors make decisions about IVF. 

Even if semen parameters look normal, there could be problems in sperm DNA which impact embryo quality. Here is what one reproductive endocrinologist, Dr. Aimee Eyvazzedah, had to say about Seed:

“I would want to do a $500 test, so I don’t have to spend $20,000 to learn things the hard way. I would do a $500 test to find out if there is anything else that I could do differently before I spend that kind of emotion and finances on a cycle.”

If you have any questions at all I am happy to answer them here, or you can call and speak with our support staff at (800) 942-2606.",t2_hegh7,False,,0,False,Discount on Episona's Male Fertility Test,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_76sdn1,False,dark,0.62,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1508206260.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><em>This post was ok&#39;d by moderators.</em></p>

While theoretically fertile, I have kidney failure, as well as hip displaysia. There is a multi-generational history of both uterine problems and miscarriages across my entire family. (Basically, I haven't had any miscarriages because I haven't tried.) I also have horrendously heavy and irregular periods. In short, even if I did try, the chances of me keeping a pregnancy are insanely slim. And I've always been told to not even try, more on that in half a second. 

I got an IUD placed yesterday to lower my chances of getting pregnant since my care team figures I have at least a 80% chance of total organ failure/death if I were to actually get pregnant. They were uncomfortable with me just using condoms so they...heavily advised...me to get an IUD. For anybody curious, I went with the copper one to avoid using hormones because I didn't want to put any more strain on my body.  

Ever since I was 8 I've always been told 2 things: ""You will **never** be a mother"", and ""Maybe medical science will catch up in time. You never know, and maybe it's too soon to tell."" The first one was from my mom, my childhood nephrologist, and some other people. The latter were people who didn't know my situation and just assumed Science would just magic up a solution that would make me not die. To some people, having your own children means giving everything, even if you die in the process and if you don't try what are you even doing as a woman. Those people hurt the most I think because it's not like I didn't want kids. I just like being alive. 

Needless to say Science did not catch up in time. In fact Science has not caught up enough to even make egg extraction for a surrogate a safe option for me. There are no options that are my egg + my husband's sperm that are a choice for us at this time. I have recently been trying to come to terms with this, and struggling, hence me seeking this community out. 

You would think that having 18 years to process that would be enough, but I spent basically 16 of those years in complete denial. It wasn't until the rest of my friends started either having their own fertility problems or having children that I really began to struggle with the fact that they were either struggling with me, or had something that I never would. Every once in awhile I get really angry at how perfect a few of my friend's lives are. They have beautiful husbands and adorable children. And it's insanely frustrating that such a life is just right on the other side of a totally insurmountable wall. 

I definitely have been grieving. I think I'm still at disbelief and anger, but at least I've accepted my status more or less. Or at the very least, I've stopped being in complete denial of the cold-hard-facts. That's not to say that my husband and I are necessarily ""child-free"". We are devastated to not be able to have little ones of our own, and are looking into fostering or adopting in the near future. I was remarking to my husband last night that yesterday when the OBGYN asked me if I wanted children, that was the first time I'd really cried about not being able to. It was super embarrassing because it was an ugly cry too. Just all at once it was ""oh wow, I really can't have kids. No but really, I. Can't. Have. My. Own. Kids. Fuuuuuuuuuuck this shit."" We have a dog, and that helps with the pain, but not all the time, and not all of it.  

Our family has been mostly understanding but you can tell that my MIL is disappointed. My own family, who I don't speak to anymore, were the most harsh about my infertility from a young age, really grinding into me that I was less than because of my inability to be a mom. I have since cut them out because who needs that in their life?

Anyway, I think that's all I really have for now. Just a ""hello, this is me and my status."" I hope I'm not stepping on anybody's toes.It's almost...relieving to finally take up my post among ""my people"". To be like ""Okay. Infertile is a word I can use to describe myself. Now that I know that, where do I go from here?""

We are both severely frustrated and confused.  We have unspecified infertility, and have been trying since 2012. We have endured the usual battery of tests and procedures, escalating to the next level as time slips away from us.  I am 37, and she has just turned 39.  What is both our blessing and our curse is that in all this time, we have had success exactly once, naturally. While I am eternally grateful for this, it has made the following years all the more confusing and frustrating for us.  Thirteen IUIs, three chemical pregnancies, one miscarriage, three failed IVFs, two failed FETs, and PGS eliminating our last 4 frozen embryos have taken their toll on us emotionally, physically, financially. 

**Here is the rough Timeline of events:**

*2012*

* TTC for 18+ Months

* Ruled out MFI

* No Emdometritis

* Various Genetic tests of both partners

* Sperm Antibody Test

* HSG

*2013*

* Semen Analysis - good

* Male and Female Karyotype - good

* Success: Natural

*2014*

* TTC naturally for 12 months

*2015-2016*

* Semen Analysis - good

* Test Endometritis - mild positive - antibiotics

* 9 IUIs, CP on #3 and #6, MC on #9 (trisomy 18: D&C at 12 weeks)

* RPL Panel - OK

* 4 more failed IUIs

*2017*

* IVF #1: 2 xfer - Negative

* IVF #2: 0 xfer - 2 d6 frozen

* Test Endometritis - mild positive - antibiotics

* FET #1: 1 xfer - Negative

* Test Endometritis - Negative

* IVF #3: 1 xfer - 4 d6 frozen - Negative

* FET #2: 1 xfer - Negative

* Male and Female Karyotype - good

* RPL Panel - OK

* PGS testing Thaw/Re-freeze the 4 in storage. 2 did not survive thaw, other 2 were PGS abnormal (tri-4, mono-5).

There were also 3 saline sonos and possibly something I may have missed.

We were in discussion with Igenomix about the ERA test, however after three weeks of discussions, they finally admitted they did not have a license in our state, and obtaining a waiver would not be possible, so the ERA test is out of reach for the  time being.

My wife has hypothyroidism, and it seems to be well controlled.   Her TSH levels are routinely tested at the clinic along with her other levels.  TSH levels are typically in teh 0.9 to 1.1 range.  FreeT4 has ranged between 1.27 and 1.69.

Another area of concern for us is that the pre IVF/FET ultrasounds typically show a 7mm to 8mm lining, usually homogeneous.  Occasionally we will see 9 or 9.5mm multi-stripe endo earlier in the cycle, but by the time the transfer comes around, it seems to reduce to 7 or 7.5mm and homogeneous.

The big question we have is, do we have a chromosomal problem with the embryos?  Or do we have an implantation issue?  This is why we finally opted for PGS testing.  Hindsight being 20/20, we were penny wise pound foolish thinking we wouldn't need the screening.  Saving one transfer would have nearly made up the cost.  We have learned the hard way, and will PGS test from here on out.  Every month saved is precious.   Our clinic's PGS specialist talked us into thawing and re-freezing our existing embryos in storage, but unfortunately this resulted in the loss of all 4.  Two did not survive the thaw, and two were abnormal.  While I look at the bright side that this potentially saved us 4+ months and the cost of four transfers, but my wife is taking it very hard.

We took a month off while she had another uterine biopsy test for endometritis to confirm its cleared  up, but now we are just about to start stims next week on our forth fresh IVF cycle.  My wife is miserable and distraught.  I don't want to press her  too hard, but I also dont want to wait.  She has just been through so many unnecessary tests and failed cycles, she has nearly lost all hope.  I am doing what I can to be the supportive husband, and I am taking over the bulk of  the communication with the doctors and nurses.  I was always a very active participant, but now she needs me to take over as much as possible, its just crushing her.

I was hoping that someone might have some suggestions for us, not pins and pineapple, but suggestions on what questions we should be asking, on what tests are could shed some light on the situation, on what we have not yet explored?  Do we just keep plugging along as we are?  I feel useless if I am not putting in the hours researching and investigating, or otherwise moving the ball forward.

<p>There were also 3 saline sonos and possibly something I may have missed.</p>

<p>We were in discussion with Igenomix about the ERA test, however after three weeks of discussions, they finally admitted they did not have a license in our state, and obtaining a waiver would not be possible, so the ERA test is out of reach for the  time being.</p>

<p>My wife has hypothyroidism, and it seems to be well controlled.   Her TSH levels are routinely tested at the clinic along with her other levels.  TSH levels are typically in teh 0.9 to 1.1 range.  FreeT4 has ranged between 1.27 and 1.69.</p>

<p>Another area of concern for us is that the pre IVF/FET ultrasounds typically show a 7mm to 8mm lining, usually homogeneous.  Occasionally we will see 9 or 9.5mm multi-stripe endo earlier in the cycle, but by the time the transfer comes around, it seems to reduce to 7 or 7.5mm and homogeneous.</p>

<p>The big question we have is, do we have a chromosomal problem with the embryos?  Or do we have an implantation issue?  This is why we finally opted for PGS testing.  Hindsight being 20/20, we were penny wise pound foolish thinking we wouldn&#39;t need the screening.  Saving one transfer would have nearly made up the cost.  We have learned the hard way, and will PGS test from here on out.  Every month saved is precious.   Our clinic&#39;s PGS specialist talked us into thawing and re-freezing our existing embryos in storage, but unfortunately this resulted in the loss of all 4.  Two did not survive the thaw, and two were abnormal.  While I look at the bright side that this potentially saved us 4+ months and the cost of four transfers, but my wife is taking it very hard.</p>

<p>We took a month off while she had another uterine biopsy test for endometritis to confirm its cleared  up, but now we are just about to start stims next week on our forth fresh IVF cycle.  My wife is miserable and distraught.  I don&#39;t want to press her  too hard, but I also dont want to wait.  She has just been through so many unnecessary tests and failed cycles, she has nearly lost all hope.  I am doing what I can to be the supportive husband, and I am taking over the bulk of  the communication with the doctors and nurses.  I was always a very active participant, but now she needs me to take over as much as possible, its just crushing her.</p>

<p>I was hoping that someone might have some suggestions for us, not pins and pineapple, but suggestions on what questions we should be asking, on what tests are could shed some light on the situation, on what we have not yet explored?  Do we just keep plugging along as we are?  I feel useless if I am not putting in the hours researching and investigating, or otherwise moving the ball forward.  It&#39;s horribly frustrating because we know we have had varying degrees of success previously, we just don&#39;t know how to get there again.</p>

It's been a little more than a year since my husband's urologist confirmed his MFI diagnosis and I lost hope that we would conceive on our own, without treatment. I cried a lot back then. I wondered why he didn't cry more. But I still was so hopeful that IVF would work for us within short order. 

In the last year, friends and family had children, while we've suffered losses and my hope disintegrated bit by bit.

We finalized our first home purchase - with a third bedroom ""for the baby"" - when I was 6 weeks pregnant, only to find out at 7 weeks, the day we picked up our keys, that another miscarriage was inevitable.

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the therapy, or that I&#39;m resigned to the unpredictable nature of science and the human body, or that I&#39;ve had some amazing friends emerge to support me, or that work has once again invigorated me, or simply that the human spirit is awfully, amazingly resilient. But I&#39;m feeling more equipped to deal with the new normal in our lives. I hate that infertility and loss brought me so much unjust pain, but I&#39;m proud of the strong woman I&#39;ve become. It&#39;s been a hard journey, but time is helping me along.</p>

Basically, if he can&#39;t give a sample before he goes to get a bone marrow transplant, it&#39;s very likely we&#39;re going to have to use a donor sperm, which is a huge blow for him. The BEST case scenario is that his sample is sufficient for IVF and we jump straight there. I&#39;m very lucky that IVF won&#39;t be a problem for me financially, so I&#39;m definitely grateful for that. It&#39;s just hard not to be so bitter. Who ever thinks they&#39;re going to be talking about chemotherapy and IVF when they&#39;re a healthy 31 year old woman with perfectly regular cycles? I long for the naivete of my teens and early 20&#39;s when I thought a guy could sneeze on me and knock me up. </p>

My husband and I are 30yo, and we're both finishing up med school. We both started medical school on the later side, after we simultaneously had career crises and decided to become doctors. Ever since we made the (very) impractical decision to go to medical school and incur hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, become financially dependent on our parents at the tender age of 30, and commit to a minimum of 7 years of training, I've obsessed over and fretted about this whole ""when to have kids"" thing. Like any good Type A-er, I drew out multiple different possible timelines and chose a med school with a relatively flexible curriculum, finally pinpointing a 10-month window that I (embarrassingly) thought would give us *plenty* of time to conceive...

...I know.

After 6 months of trying unsuccessfully, complete with OPKs and BBT monitoring, my husband convinced himself that something was wrong with him. He's been struggling with low self-esteem for separate reasons, and he seized upon our lack of success as certain proof of his worthlessness. Confident that his semen analysis would be normal (because, I told myself, statistically he should be fine), I encouraged him just to go get tested. I thought a nice, healthy SA result would give him a much needed confidence boost...

...I know.

So, here we are, two semen analyses (both showing oligospermia, with 10 M/cc and 6 M/cc, and tenuous motility) and an RE initial consult (with a strong recommendation for jumping right to IVF w/ ICSI) later.

I guess I don't have any specific questions at this point, but I thought it might make me feel better or help me begin to process things if I put some of my thoughts into words and sent it off to a sympathetic place. I also just wanted to thank everyone on this sub for creating an online community that isn't filled with all the fairy dust bullshit that seems to dominate every other ""TTC"" forum on the internet.

I&#39;m trying to figure out how to cope (&quot;should we get a dog? we should probably get a dog, right? what about another cat? our cat would probably like a little kitty friend, right?&quot;), how much to share with family/friends (I don&#39;t even have the language to talk about all this yet), how to curb my retail therapy tendencies (I&#39;m embarrassed to say that a shirt and two pairs of shoes I don&#39;t need are already on their way to our apartment), and how to talk to my husband about how scared and upset I am without making him feel even shittier than he already does. </p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t have any specific questions at this point, but I thought it might make me feel better or help me begin to process things if I put some of my thoughts into words and sent it off to a sympathetic place. I also just wanted to thank everyone on this sub for creating an online community that isn&#39;t filled with all the fairy dust bullshit that seems to dominate every other &quot;TTC&quot; forum on the internet. I can&#39;t begin to describe how helpful this place has been over the past few weeks as all of this has been unfolding.</p>

<p>Thanks y&#39;all.</p>

In anticipation of the end of treatment, I've given long thought to how to put a period on this phase of my life.

Here are some of the tasks on my to-do list that I could use any help with Saturday...I'd love to do this as a fresh start for our future and a way to say goodbye to these last four years.

I then listed about a dozen household chores. You guys, people showed up and worked like dogs all day long. They put their marriages on the line and WENT TO IKEA for me. Twice! They did every single thing on my loooooong to-do list, and they took care of me all day long while they worked. Three people brought bouquets of flowers, so my sparkling-clean apartment smelled like a rose garden for a week. Their gift to my husband and me was a generous act of service, and it was pure love. I'm crying right now remembering it. I was in such a bad place before that day, but my friends lifted me out of it, really and truly.

I come from a family that values hard work and a do-it-yourself, no complaints attitude. We can be on the ground with broken legs, daggers through the stomach, and bleeding eye sockets, and we'll be like, ""Hospital? No, no, I wouldn't want to put you out. Now if you'll just hand me that rag so I can clean up all this blood, tut tut tut."" Asking for help does not come naturally to us, and that's certainly true for me. That's why my last birthday was as special as it was. I needed to learn to ask for help, and when I did, I was overwhelmed by the support we received. My friends gave joyfully, and they have since checked in with us more often to see how we're doing emotionally.

I'm telling you this because we often debate here about whether or not to open up about our struggles, and I want to share my positive experience. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the decision to come out about IF is deeply personal and unique for each individual. I had built a foundation of trust with each of those friends over the years, and I carefully selected the recipients of that particular email. The risk of emotional pain was low for me in this circumstance. That might not be true for you, so you might need to make a different decision.

I&#39;m crying right now remembering it. I was in such a bad place before that day, but my friends lifted me out of it, really and truly.</p>

<p>I come from a family that values hard work and a do-it-yourself, no complaints attitude. We can be on the ground with broken legs, daggers through the stomach, and bleeding eye sockets, and we&#39;ll be like, &quot;Hospital? No, no, I wouldn&#39;t want to put you out. Now if you&#39;ll just hand me that rag so I can clean up all this blood, tut tut tut.&quot; Asking for help does not come naturally to us, and that&#39;s certainly true for me. That&#39;s why my last birthday was as special as it was. I needed to learn to ask for help, and when I did, I was overwhelmed by the support we received. My friends gave joyfully, and they have since checked in with us more often to see how we&#39;re doing emotionally.</p>

<p>I&#39;m telling you this because we often debate here about whether or not to open up about our struggles, and I want to share my positive experience. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the decision to come out about IF is deeply personal and unique for each individual. I had built a foundation of trust with each of those friends over the years, and I carefully selected the recipients of that particular email. The risk of emotional pain was low for me in this circumstance. That might not be true for you, so you might need to make a different decision.</p>

<p>We got our best-case scenario. If you decide to open up more or ask for help, I hope you get your best-case too.</p>

Here are my notes in case anyone might find them useful along with the links to studies. Mainly my notes are about PCOS relations to these supplements but only one of the studies was on PCOS patients specifically, the rest were general. Hopefully someone can benefit from the research and cliff notes here :)  

All of the studies discussing all three supplements below suggest that the compounds found in follicular fluid during supplementation help maturation of oocytes. It seems to reduce oxidative stress on oocytes reducing both Reactive Oxygen Species as well as Reactive Nitrogen species.

Melatonin:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209073/   (1)

Notes from study labelled 1, note this one is a compilation of studies on melatonin hence the varying results noted here: 

1. Most of these studies had relatively small sample sizes but most found the same results in humans, with the exclusion of one that found some damage in rat gametes.  

2. Most of the studies seem to suggest that melatonin supplementation can help with oxidative stress resistance. Higher antioxidant levels in follicular fluid were found to correlate to higher pregnancy rates.  

3. Timing seems to be suggested during the stimulation phase of IVF but I’ve noted other studies which say 2 -3 months  

4. Results pretty around the board are statistically significant improvements in mature oocyte numbers, fertilization rates, and grade 1 embryos.Highlighted portions show the results of the different studies collected.  

5. Melatonin supplementation has also been shows in one study to improve motility and and the percentage of progressively motile sperm, also specifically appearing to reduce apoptosis in sperm!!!  

6. Combining three therapies, melatonin 3mg per day, myo-inositol 4g and folic acid 400mcg, found significantly higher rates of mature oocytes and grade 1 embryos in a few studies these supplementation times were 3 months before the IVF cycle and achieved increases in all three areas in women with PCOS who had a failed IVF cycle prior  

    1. Specifically with PCOS women with a failed cycle prior, the supplementation of of just melatonin raised fert rates from 22.8 +- 19% to 50.0 +- 38%  

    2. Different study used both melatonin and myo-inositol and found higher rates of all three  

7. Summation: Lots of studies have found good results, it has a good safety profile and can be an adjunctive therapy to IVF treatment but needs more well designed studies to be have enough evidence to recommend routine use.  

Myo-inositol:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5011528/  (2)

Notes from study labelled 2:  

1. Basically this study is aiming to show that myo-inositol combined with folic acid can be a effective treatment  for PCOS instead of metformin as it has less side effects and has been shown to help insulin resistance  

2. patients took 2 x 2000 mg myo-inositol and 2 x 200 mcg of folic acid per day for at least 2-3 months  

3. Total testosterone levels showed significant decreases, free testosterone showed significant decreases and progesterone was 6x higher with the supplementation   

4. 70% of patients restored ovulation after treatment  

5. After 16 weeks of treatment, stat sig improvements in blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose and insulin values after a glucose test were found.   

6. NO side effects were observed using the standard dose

Notes from study labelled 3:  

1. Dosages are same as above for this one and timeframe was 3 months before undergoing the IVF cycle  

2. After treatment, number of mature oocytes, fert rate, number of both total and top quality embryos were statistically higher than previous cycle, while no difference in number of oocytes retrieved.  

3. This study was on women 38-42 years old who failed to become pregnant from previous IVF cycle due to poor oocyte quality  

4. In the second round of IVF after 3 months of supplementation, patient characteristics were static, however simulation days, rFSH units administered were reduced, number of oocytes retrieved showed no difference, MII oocyte numbers increased, fert rates increased, number of score 1 and 2 embryos transferred was also statistically higher, implantation rate was 22.8% in the second cycle compared to 0% in the first cycle, with a pregnancy rate of 28.3%, with a clinical pregnancy rate of 19.6%, 44.4% of those ended in miscarriage.",t2_ckd5l,False,,0,False,Update: Studies on egg quality improvements during IVF cycles.,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_753n2m,False,dark,0.99,,public,39,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,39,,False,self,1507489685.0,,[],{},,True,,1507518122.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I found some studies and did some research specifically on melatonin, myoinositol, and folic acid supplementation.

Grief-wise, I am moving right along, have more interest in life now and looking to conceive again. However we haven't been using protection since I gave birth and I immediately started to really track things (because loss/grief brain was very urgent to get pregnant again).  OPKs, temping, timing sex, Sperm Meets Egg Plan, no lube, blah blah. 

I decided to see an RE two cycles ago because I just had a feeling something was off. She was annoying at first and it seemed like she didn't want to take me too seriously because we ""conceived naturally before"" within a good time range, but she agreed to do all the testing. I did an HSG and it came back with one blocked tube. This started to  worry me, but I was at least happy that we were beginning to get some answers.

Well...My husband did a Sperm Analysis and the results surprised us: 3 million count, low Motility and mobility. My husband now feels like shit, although he won't admit it openly to me. When we met for a follow up, RE said we will repeat the analysis (now scheduled for this Tuesday), and if his numbers are higher, we can possibly look into unblocking my tube and continuing to try naturally. Otherwise, she thinks IVF is our best option. 

So...is this correct? I mean, I know it's difficult to really know because the second SA has not been done. My husband really thinks his decreased count is due to environmental factors. He has been grieving our loss by drinking and smoking more than usual. He wants me to give him time to get healthier, before we go to IVF. And now he has stopped everything altogether, limiting drinking to just a few times a month, taking multivitamins, etc.

I'm sorry this has become a rant... I am just looking for some advice. Did my husband have MFI all along, and we ""lucked out"" with natural conception in the past? Are we wasting time waiting for his new SA results? should we just run to the RE for an IVF consultation?

Our first pregnancy, we tried and conceived within 6 months, February 2016. I had a full-term stillbirth that was ruled &quot;unexplained&quot; 10 days before my due date in November. </p>

<p>Grief-wise, I am moving right along, have more interest in life now and looking to conceive again. However we haven&#39;t been using protection since I gave birth and I immediately started to really track things (because loss/grief brain was very urgent to get pregnant again).  OPKs, temping, timing sex, Sperm Meets Egg Plan, no lube, blah blah. </p>

<p>I decided to see an RE two cycles ago because I just had a feeling something was off. She was annoying at first and it seemed like she didn&#39;t want to take me too seriously because we &quot;conceived naturally before&quot; within a good time range, but she agreed to do all the testing. I did an HSG and it came back with one blocked tube. This started to  worry me, but I was at least happy that we were beginning to get some answers.</p>

<p>Well...My husband did a Sperm Analysis and the results surprised us: 3 million count, low Motility and mobility. My husband now feels like shit, although he won&#39;t admit it openly to me. When we met for a follow up, RE said we will repeat the analysis (now scheduled for this Tuesday), and if his numbers are higher, we can possibly look into unblocking my tube and continuing to try naturally. Otherwise, she thinks IVF is our best option. </p>

<p>So...is this correct? I mean, I know it&#39;s difficult to really know because the second SA has not been done. My husband really thinks his decreased count is due to environmental factors. He has been grieving our loss by drinking and smoking more than usual. He wants me to give him time to get healthier, before we go to IVF. And now he has stopped everything altogether, limiting drinking to just a few times a month, taking multivitamins, etc.</p>

I've been off this board for about 8 months (just needed a break from thinking about IF for awhile), but I'm back with a hello and a question. Pretty sure my fourth transfer just failed (per results of at home PT at 9 days post 5dt.) This is also my second failed transfer of PGS tested embryos and this time we put in two. 

Anyone else go through this? And what did your RE end up trying? This cycle I was on prednisone and Lovenox. Eggs are from egg donor. Two blasts were actively hatching when they were transferred.  Had a saline ultrasound and everything looked good. Lining always looked good. Blood tests return normal results for clotting factor issues (but Lovenox is there to just in case). At this point I'm thinking, it's either a genetic issue on Husband's side that the PGS testing isn't picking up (this is our third egg donor, for the first two all the embryos arrested before day five) or there's something going on with me. We did have one successful implantation once (on our very first transfer) but it ended in a CP at about 5 weeks,

EDIT: Thanks everyone!  I got a lot of great suggestions and I'll talk to the RE about Igenomix, a biopsy and a receptivity test--as well as potential immunotherapy treatment for our final blastocyst.  (Great more pain, AND more money).  If this final transfer doesn't work out we might just move onto donor embryos, but the idea of burning through a bunch of those just to realize the problem is me is pretty awful.

Our appointment is next Tuesday and our RE emailed us this morning and he included a study that talked about using letrozole to improve the quality of eggs. In the beginning of the study it says ‘Letrozole inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the home of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a blockade of androgen conversion into estrogen and a subsequent increase in intraovarian androgens.’

Ok so first if all I don’t really understand what that means. If someone can ELI5 that would be awesome. Secondly, I’ve done a 23andme test and I remember seeing that I had a +/- on the gene for cyp450. Would that affect the way letrozole worked for me? If I’m remembering correctly cyp450 has something to do with being a fast metabolizer of certain medications but I don’t know that could be wrong..it’s been a long time since I’ve looked at that. 

Anyway if someone understands this and could help explain it that would be awesome! But my RE said that we could add this in addition to my stim protocol if we decide it’s something we want to do.

A lot of clinics I've seen have easily been $10,000 or more. So I just wanted to share with you my clinic in case anyone is interested in exploring other options. 

It's CNY fertility Center and they have 4 locations in NY. Now I'll say, I think their SART score is lower than average, but that's because they don't turn away anyone for any reason. A lot of clinics will make you be a certain bmi, or will only help if you use donor eggs or whatever, but CNY doesn't do that and those scores are likely reflective of that. Of course if they think you should follow a certain path they will make suggestions, but ultimately it's your decision and they're willing to at least try. 

The cost of 1 IVF cycle is $3900. That includes everything except meds and monitoring. Most people monitor locally at home and just travel to NY for the procedure. And when I say includes everything, I mean everything. Anesthesia, retrieval, ICSI fertilization, assisted hatching, transfer and cryopreservation of remaining embryos. Free storage of remaining embryos for a year, and $350/year after that. Also free FET (Minus meds and monitoring) for a year. 

They also offer in house financing with no credit checks. If you do the 24 month plan (the longest they offer) payments end up being about $205/month. 

There's no doubt theres people who have probably had bad experiences with CNY, but that's going to happen at ANY clinic. The main Dr (and all of the staff) truly cares and even gives his personal cell phone number to anyone who wants it (even people who aren't patients and are just curious about cny).

Also free phone consults (but these do tend to run late) 

Theres several Facebook groups if anyone wants to talk  to more actual patients. 

So again, I'm just sharing this to maybe help even one person who might be struggling to figure out a way to afford ivf :) 

ALSO for anyone needing or interested in doing PGS/PGD, the biopsy fee there is only $700 for up to 8. Not $700 each embryo, $700 for a total of up to 8 and then I believe it's $75 for each additional embryo after 8.

Heyyyyyy ladies,
I promised to update you on what would happen. So a little less than a month before I left Argentina, I started taking hormones to reduce my tumor. The surgery, so far, is not necessary. 
As I went back home last month, I went to see my doc and she gave me the OK for the treatment.

However I have not seen my endocrinologist yet and I need to control myself a bit and not get over enthusiastic. The doc in Argentina told me it might take two to three years before my body gets back to fertile again, and I might have to take hormones for life for my bones (the hyperprolactina make them weaker).

So here it is. Hope I don't trigger anyone, but I checked briefly with my doc, and I'm starting to wonder what to do in terms of contraception if I get fertile sooner (I'm only 22, for now baby isn't in my plans yet). I don't have a boyfriend at the moment but at some stake I might and my doc told me to get rid of the pill forever, and any hormonal contraception.

We are looking at doing another IVF cycle in a few months pending some more work on my husbands semen parameters (severe dna frag, low count morph and rapid and linear), but after my trisomy 13 pregnancy loss, that is related to maternal factors, and with my last IVF cycle having 56 eggs and 36 mature, and only getting two embryos, one of which was trisomy 13 and the other which was a failed FET, I’m looking for studies to present to our RE on Monday. I have high BMI and am now on a ketogenic diet to lose weight over the next few months but am looking for more studies to present to my RE to discuss what possible things we can do to explain or improve my egg quality. So come at me with your studies or data! </p>

This is a safe place. Mentions of current pregnancies aren't allowed for actual reasons! We hear about pregnancies and see it every day in our real lives. I come here for a safe haven. The results threads and beta threads were created for those reasons.

Often times, the most upvoted response is very uplifting and hopeful but totally ancedotal. Those responses have their place but we also need to be a place of realism. </p>

<p>Vagina. Period. Sperm. Embryos. Get used to saying those words. The cutesy has got to go. Infertility is not cute.</p>

<p>This sub is just as much for the users who have suffered for years of IF as it is for the new. But please. For goodness sake, don&#39;t consider us your benchmark for pain. We all started somewhere with our first treatments but IF hasn&#39;t been as kind to some of us and we are on the wrong side of statistics. I never thought I would be heading into my third retrieval, and yet here I am. I don&#39;t need to be reminded that my reality is your nightmare.</p>

<p>This is a safe place. Mentions of current pregnancies aren&#39;t allowed for actual reasons! We hear about pregnancies and see it every day in our real lives. I come here for a safe haven. The results threads and beta threads were created for those reasons. </p>

<p>Where are the educational posts or discussions? <a href=""/u/giantredwoodforest"">/u/giantredwoodforest</a>&#39;s why did my FET fail? <a href=""/u/Meg449"">/u/Meg449</a> (&amp; <a href=""/u/HermesHippie"">/u/HermesHippie</a>&#39;s more recent) mega post of medication costs.

I wanted to make this post to pay it forward and hopefully help anyone in a similar situation in the future if they do a search. I know when I was first told what was going on with my reproductive parts, I searched and read as many posts as I could on here and on other subreddits.


Some updated stats: I'm 28 (29 in 4 days!), and my partner recently turned 35. His SA showed great numbers across the board. My last CD3 labs are from March 2017 and don't show anything remarkable except for very, very low vitamin D levels which prompted my doctor to prescribe me megadoses of supplements to help that. I was told my AMH is high (10.66), but that this would only indicate *number* of eggs and not *quality* of eggs. More on that later...


I developed an autoimmune disorder related to the colon called Ulcerative Colitis in 2012 and had to have major surgery to remove my diseased and damaged colon in 2013. My surgeon had to make a large incision in the abdomen and was having to do a lot of disruptive work around my ovaries and fallopian tubes. I ended up with nerve damage to my bladder and have had to self-cath to pee because of it. However, I was under the impression that there were no major issues with my reproductive parts. In fact, my surgeon and I settled on doing one surgery as opposed to 2-3 surgeries (to reconstruct a colon from my small intestines) in order to preserve my fertility. This decision to forego a reconstructed colon left me with a permanent ostomy on my abdomen, but I have always strangely been completely fine with my ""bag"".


We started trying to get pregnant in 2016, but in 2017, we were a bit derailed by what my doctors thought were back-to-back UTIs (more common in people who have to use catheters, unfortunately). I was having pain and discomfort around my bladder, but my urine kept coming back negative for bacteria. At this point, we feared another autoimmune issue now attacking the bladder (interstitial cystitis, IC). So, my urologist ordered three imaging tests to rule out everything but IC: transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasounds, CT scan with contrast, and an upright MRI with contrast. I also had a cystoscopy performed (a camera is snaked up through the urethra and into bladder in order to look at the inside and look for lesions or tumors or damage to bladder wall). The cystoscopy came back completely normal. However, the other three imaging tests came back showing a swollen fallopian tube and what might have been a large, complex hemorrhagic cyst on one of my ovaries. I was told the cyst could be a cancerous mass. I was referred to an RE.


Up to this point, I had been lucky enough to have everything covered by the VA. However, since none of my service-connected injuries were officially tied to infertility, I had to fall back on retiree insurance. After looking at my imaging results and conducting a sonohysterogram (SHG) with saline, my RE told me that I had a right hydrosalpinx. For some unknown reason, my right fallopian tube was swollen and was full of fluid that is toxic to embryos, impedes implantation, and increases rates of miscarriage. She gave us a 1-5% chance of giving birth to a live baby on our own. However, she said we'd be excellent candidates for IVF...after taking out the bad tube.


I didn't know how to feel. Part of me was glad that a surgeon would open me up and actually get to look--with their own eyes--at the supposed mass on my ovary. Plus, I was okay losing one tube considering it was never going to be able to do its job anyway. But the thought of another surgery scared me, and the cost of IVF freaked us both out. We thought about it a lot for a couple of weeks before meeting the surgeon, and we became comfortable with the idea of the procedure. I asked if we could do one round of IVF and freeze any embryo(s) before the surgery just in case there would be any damage to my ovaries. Our first round in August of 2017 yielded 18 eggs of which only 9 were mature. However, all 9 fertilized via ICSI, and we ended up with 1 day-6 BB grade blastocyst to freeze. Not exactly the number we were expecting, and my RE suspects an egg quality issue. I'm another example of how high AMH doesn't mean great eggs, unfortunately...


I finally had the surgery done in September of 2017. We weren't sure what news I'd wake up to. Would I have to lose some or all of my left ovary? Would there actually be endometriosis found as the cause for my chronic pelvic pain? Would my left tube also be too damaged and have to come out? Would I wake up essentially ""sterile""?


Well, when I woke up from surgery and groggily asked my partner what had happened, I cried...the surgeon had to remove both of my tubes. Bilateral salpingectomy. Damn.


On the bright side, there was no endometriosis and no cyst, and this is yet another example of why sometimes all of the imaging tests in the world can't tell the full (or correct) story! After starting the surgery, my surgeon discovered that--at some point--my tubes had both wrapped around the back of my uterus and were stuck to each other with scar tissue. My ovaries had migrated a bit, too, so my radiologists and doctors had been trying to interpret images with everything all jumbled up inside of me. This was also the reason for my chronic bladder/pelvic pain: the glued tubes had been putting pressure on my cervix which put pressure on my bladder. In fact, after a week of recovery, I noticed that laying flat on my back didn't hurt my bladder anymore (my bladder had been sort of draped painfully over the protruding cervix), and my frequency and urgency have both decreased dramatically. It all made sense now!


Recovering physically hasn't been terrible. Recovering mentally has been a different story, though. Logically, I realize that these tubes were causing more harm than good and **needed** to go. I also realize that it's not the end of us trying to start a family. We have IVF. We have surrogacy, if it ever comes to that. A few other options remain. However, it's just been hard to wrap my mind around the fact that I must rely 100% on ART to grow our family. It's such a scary thought, for some reason. Maybe it's because we may not always have the money to go through IVF. Maybe it's because the magical, FSB miracle is NEVER going to ever be possible (even though the odds of it happening before were slim to none already). It all just feels so...final. So permanent. And it is. It's not the end of the world, but I think it's the end of certain possibilities that has me feeling weird.


Anyway, the positives: no more birth control between kids and no more condoms during IVF cycles. No more need to interpret mucous or OPKs. No more waking up to check BBT. I haven't been doing any of this over the last 6 months anyway, but it's sort of nice to have that extra brain capacity freed up a bit. Shout out to /u/marmarwebweb for helping me realize these positives because it's helped me slowly come to terms with everything and accept my body again. There's also no risk of ectopic pregnancy, and no more toxic tube fluid present to get in the way of implantation.


So, for now, we are going to do at least one more round of IVF to try and bank more embryos since my RE is worried that we are racing my ovaries for babies right now. She prescribed me CoQ10 pills and myoinositol powder to *try* and maybe make a difference in my eggs. We shall know soon enough...

I wanted to make this post to pay it forward and hopefully help anyone in a similar situation in the future if they do a search. I know when I was first told what was going on with my reproductive parts, I searched and read as many posts as I could on here and on other subreddits.</p>

<p>Some updated stats: I&#39;m 28 (29 in 4 days!), and my partner recently turned 35. His SA showed great numbers across the board. My last CD3 labs are from March 2017 and don&#39;t show anything remarkable except for very, very low vitamin D levels which prompted my doctor to prescribe me megadoses of supplements to help that. I was told my AMH is high (10.66), but that this would only indicate <em>number</em> of eggs and not <em>quality</em> of eggs. More on that later...</p>

<p>I developed an autoimmune disorder related to the colon called Ulcerative Colitis in 2012 and had to have major surgery to remove my diseased and damaged colon in 2013. My surgeon had to make a large incision in the abdomen and was having to do a lot of disruptive work around my ovaries and fallopian tubes. I ended up with nerve damage to my bladder and have had to self-cath to pee because of it. However, I was under the impression that there were no major issues with my reproductive parts. In fact, my surgeon and I settled on doing one surgery as opposed to 2-3 surgeries (to reconstruct a colon from my small intestines) in order to preserve my fertility. This decision to forego a reconstructed colon left me with a permanent ostomy on my abdomen, but I have always strangely been completely fine with my &quot;bag&quot;.</p>

<p>We started trying to get pregnant in 2016, but in 2017, we were a bit derailed by what my doctors thought were back-to-back UTIs (more common in people who have to use catheters, unfortunately). I was having pain and discomfort around my bladder, but my urine kept coming back negative for bacteria. At this point, we feared another autoimmune issue now attacking the bladder (interstitial cystitis, IC). So, my urologist ordered three imaging tests to rule out everything but IC: transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasounds, CT scan with contrast, and an upright MRI with contrast. I also had a cystoscopy performed (a camera is snaked up through the urethra and into bladder in order to look at the inside and look for lesions or tumors or damage to bladder wall). The cystoscopy came back completely normal. However, the other three imaging tests came back showing a swollen fallopian tube and what might have been a large, complex hemorrhagic cyst on one of my ovaries. I was told the cyst could be a cancerous mass. I was referred to an RE.</p>

<p>Up to this point, I had been lucky enough to have everything covered by the VA. However, since none of my service-connected injuries were officially tied to infertility, I had to fall back on retiree insurance. After looking at my imaging results and conducting a sonohysterogram (SHG) with saline, my RE told me that I had a right hydrosalpinx.

In the beginning, I was a little upset because he and my mom did not check on me what so ever during last week after I told them we risked to have to cancel our cycle due to poor response. 

Eventually, I shrugged it off, and I thought that no comment would be better than a bad one and I moved on. 
Yesterday, however, after the news of me having to go into the hospital overnight for my egg collection tomorrow, I expected a little more support from them. When it did not arrive (my mom went away for a mini holiday from yesterday till Friday) I messaged my brother asking if they were struggling to understand the impact that this process had on me (as we live in different countries) and that I was in much need of better support from them.

He replied with a series of very harsh voice messages telling me that I should stop behaving like the rest of world revolves around me, that they support me, but they are finding themselves unable to communicate with me since they feel they need to walk on eggshells when we talk. He accused me to be obsessed and obsessive about the IVF process (1st cycle and if you read my post history you will understand how much of a rollercoaster it has been so far). 

In specific, he was angry I asked my mum not to call his dog ""her furry grandson"" with me because my request left her hurt and shaken. 

I explained that I simply asked them to use common sense, and avoid gratuitous comments about babies (my mum tends to tell me about everyone who is pregnant, even people I don't know). 
I explained why these comments made me upset to her and last night to him too.

He replied saying that I am taking the negative out of good intentions from their side, and basically I should deal with it because they mean well. 

I lost it, I told him that I was done with trying to receive empathy from them, that from now on I would simply update them with the basic news and that was it. I also advised him to read and listen to his messages a few days from now, hoping he would understand that people in need of support just need to be reassured in the way that makes them feel better, not attacked like he did. 
I told him I love him but because I would do anything for him, he has also the power to hurt me like no one else in my life, and I was done receiving abuse from him.

His last message simply stated: ""You don't understand how hard it is to find a way to support you"". I didn't reply.

My wife and I are in our late twenties and are (or actually were) really trying to have kids. We moved to a quieter (and larger) house and were completely ready for our own little family (we already got the cat). 

Compared to our friends we are starting a bit early. This was due to medical reasons on her side, we simply couldn't wait for much longer.

After nine months of trying we both started the procedure of checking if anything was wrong. For her it was a repeated checkup and for me it was my first time. 

Quite quickly it became clear something was wrong on my side. We had a consult with a specialist two weeks ago to discuss the results. The doctor was the most inconsiderate and rude doctor I have ever met with absolutely no empathy, however besides that all the results weren't good. The concentration was simply so low that nothing can be done.

We didn't expect that. We thought that IVF or other procedures were possible. Hearing that nothing could be done was (and still is a bit) inconceivable. 

I will be going to another specialist if it could have other reasons (such as cancer..) however the suggestion is mainly finding a donor or adoption. Our preference eventually goes to adoption - but at the moment we do not feel ready to think about that. 

Now for the venting. I simply can't. It feels like I am in a  limbo between grief and indifference. Smiling feels fake. When it is busy at work I can focus on something else, but on quiet days like these I simply feel like Marvin. Depressed and autonomous. 

I feel a huge chunk of raw emotion buried deep inside under a layer of rationality. I want to let it out, but I don't know how.

That's what it boils down to. I just don't know what to do. There are so many simultaneous feelings and emotions. Anger, regret, guilt, grief, hopelessness, empty and directionless.

As a final note I am the luckiest man alive with my wife. She has been so great and supportive and we've really been there for each other. 

Sorry and thank you for listening. Though my friends and family have been amazing, it's good to talk to people who know how it feels. Even though it's nothing 'new'

I woke VERY briefly in recovery in agony, and couldn't stay awake. I awoke again much later, back in day surgery, still no partner by my side. I was traumatised and upset. A woman appeared with my clothes, told me to get dressed and come take a seat in a chair down the front. Post-op I have very little voice (turns out I almost developed pneumonia) and called and called for her to ring my partner. 

""Yep will do sweets!"" 

Got dressed and dragged my sore, aching body to a chair, reclined it, put my feet up and expected a nurse/doc to come by and give me a run down of what happened. 

Nothing. No one. 

I again tried four or five times to get someone's attention to ring my partner (I was in no state to do it myself, I could barely keep my eyelids open). Finally they ring him. He arrives, they give me a sandwich and a drink and send me home. 

That's it. No paper work. No doctor visit. Nothing. 

Still completely out of it, they get me to the car, and  my partner helps me get in. On the way home he starts to question what happened as he had been given the run around all day and was told I'd been in surgery for 3 hours longer than I was. He'd been expecting something worst case. He asks if anyone told me anything, 
'no, not that I remember and they wouldn't come see me in recovery right? They took me out of there before I was even properly awake!' 

They discharged  me before even telling me a damn THING that happened in my surgery. Before my specialist had even been to see me. 

While sleeping at home, I missed a phone call. It was my surgeon/IF specialist! He left a voicemail, sounding very displeased that I had been discharged before seeing him, but more importantly, he informed me that my RHS tube was not salvageable, it was removed. He also discovered that my LHS had been blocked and he had removed the blockage, cleared it out and fixed her up. 

So the past two years of infertility have a cause. They're no longer unexplained. I thought I would cry if they removed my RHS tube, but I'm so overjoyed by answers that I was just dumbfounded. 

I have an appointment to see him, get the full run down, and start planning in 6 weeks. 

Since that shitty ordeal, I've been home, mainly bed ridden. Scrolling through social media, I've found that I'm not angry anymore, I can actually look at our friends children and not be filled with resentment and jealousy. I actually commented on a photo, of how big little S is and we need to catch up when I'm mobile again, and the best part was, 
I actually meant it. 

I'm actually more friends with the father (K) of S, but since they started dating, the mother (A) has really grown on me and we actually get along really well. But once she became pregnant, I kind of pushed them both away, as it caused me so much pain. Both the Mum and Dad have commented on how they want me and partner to be a part of their child's life, and how they think we'll be great parents, usual friends-with-babies stuff. 

But today, out of the blue, A messaged me. ""Can I ask, is it endo that you've got? K and I were talking about you and (partner) trying but couldn't remember""

As I was typing her a little post-surgery update she followed up with this. 

""Because I said to him that I'd surrogate for you if it ended up being what you needed""

I have never cried so hard, and so quickly in my entire life. Partner and I have talked about surrogacy, if we needed to go there, but I couldn't think of anyone who we thought would do it for us. Partner seems to think it's not that big of a deal of expect someone to carry our baby around for 9 months and then hand it over and not be a parent (anyone else have this problem?)   I'm just in awe of the utter selflessness of this offer, and am honestly feeling blessed to have such wonderful people around me. 

I just wanted to share some good news, after two years of waiting for this surgery,  it sure does feel like a win to come out with answers.

I've been lurking a while looking for answers and thought I should just post instead :P My wife and I (both 30yo) thought it would be easy to have children. No history of infertility on either side so things should've been ok. Here we are after 2 years of constant failures, with one year of tests, IUIs and hormones. The diagnosis : unexplained infertility. 

My numbers seem pretty decent (morphology at 2%, but doctors said considering the other numbers, it shouldn't be an obstacle) and everything is fine on my wife's end too so far. However, this is really taking a toll on us individually and as a couple. 

My wife has been on a sick leave from work for around 5 months now, leaving me as the sole provider (she does get some sort of workers comp. though). Seeing all her coworkers get pregnant really took it out of her. She is on medication (a type of anti depressant) that doesn't seem to help at all, but it does prevent her from sleeping. So she now also takes sleeping pills, which makes her groggy for most of the day. All meds are approved for couples that are trying to concieve of course. This usually means that when I get home, I make dinner, do the dishes and other house hold chores because she also gets really dizzy from the meds. 

To top it all off, I work at a place I can barely stand anymore, just so we can have the money to keep going with fertility procedures and pay our mortgage. Speaking of which, she has a laparoscopy planned in a few weeks and she is scared to death about it. Has anyone here ever undergone this procedure and has any input/advice?

Sorry about the venting. It's just really fruatrating and today is also the official 2 years of infertility day, so the weekend was really rough for us. Anyway, to everyone who took the time to read and/or respond, thanks. It always feels nice to know someone is listening.

* I'm 25 Husband is 24 

* Trying since August 2016 (13 months)
* March 2017- Chemical 1. I was also diagnosed with PCOS by an Endocrinologist based on long cycles but she wouldn't give me any medication for my cycles or ovulation until we hit a year. 
* May- Chemical 2
* June-Chemical 3
* July- RPL panel drawn and it came back all normal besides prothrombin and MTHFR 
* August- HSG that came back all normal.
* September- Chemical 4 and first RE appointment

**RE appointment**

* Dr straight away said I need IVF +PGS since I've had 4 chemicals in such a short space of time.
* According to him MTHFR, Prothrombin, and Progesterone have nothing to do with recurring losses.
* So no 7dpo draw, progesterone supplements, or blood thinners for me.
* I haven't had any interventions yet, not even clomid. 
* He wants to do Karyotyping on my husband just to confirm his theory of chromosomal translocation on my husband.
* We could continue trying on our own if the karyotyping comes back ok but he said my risk of miscarriage any given cycle is 40% now after so many losses and with IVF it would be less than 10%.
* He also had an issue with my TSH (almost 3) and positive TPO antibodies so I now switched my PCOS diagnosis for a Hashimotos one. Now I'm on synthroid 1x a day. 
* Had an ultrasound turns out my ovaries look normal. So no PCOS. (AFC of 18) but then he mentioned, “oh you may have a diminishing egg count”. 
* I also have a short uterus, apparently (58mm)

*So that brings me to my questions-*

* Is the RE onto something? Should I prepare for being a straight to IVF couple? It will likely take us a year to be financially ready for that, and he doesn't want to do any other sort of intervention prior to IVF.
* Is DOR a concern with a normal AMH and AFC of 18?
* Does a short uterus make a damn bit of difference?
* Should I be on some kind of blood thinner for the Prothrombin? Even if it's just baby aspirin?

I have no problem with doing IVF. I just left the appointment feeling pushed into it and it's going to take some planning/saving and I was hoping for some steps to take to build up to that. I feel kind of cornered because he told me the best and maybe only way for me to have a successful pregnancy is IVF+PGS and he heavily implied that my eggs are declining and so I should get a move on ASAP.

I was prepared for the hormonal craziness that can occur with stimming but I did not have any of it - in fact I felt the best I have in years even though I was uncomfortable and bloated for most of it. Sleep was next to impossible.

I have anxiety and mild depression that I don't take any meds for that improved dramatically while on stims. I was genuinely happy and smiled a lot to the point that people noticed.

On top of all this, my hypoglycaemia went away even though I consumed more carbs and sugar than I normally do (it was the only thing that tasted good). I did the 2 hr glucose test a month ago and it came back fine but I still was having issues with blood sugar dropping in the mid afternoon and making me hangry. 

And I wasn't freezing cold all day or groggy mid afternoon. Brain fog went away too. Thyroid is under control with synthroid but before stims I was still always cold.

5 days after my retrieval everything is coming back - cold, sleepy, sugar crashes, grumpy, brain fog.

Given my issues with hair loss, possible endo and pcos - I wondering if maybe this is all due to a progesterone imbalance.

Anyone else's anxiety/depression get better while stimming? Any ideas on what test to ask for the next time I go to the RE?

Thanks!

edit: 
Clomid made me cray-cray. I was very easily annoyed and very grumpy.

**Background:** 
24 year old male, diagnosed with hypogonadism and began testosterone replacement therapy (2.5g of androgel daily). Decided to get a semen analysis to get a baseline for fertility, although didn't do the test until about 3 weeks into treatment.

**Results:**   
* Volume: 1.5 (reference range: 1.5 - 5.0 ml)  
* Viscosity: Semi-gelatinous, semen does not form normal discrete droplets.  
* Sperm motility: 20 (reference range: greater than 50%) **flagged as abnormal**  
* Sperm count: 153 (reference range: greater than 20 x 10E6/ml)  
* Abnormal sperm: 60 (reference range: less than 40%)  

**Lab comments:**  
Morphology: Variation in size of heads and or trails. Malformation of the acrosomal/postacrossomal region. Cytoplasmic extrusion mass.  

Interpretation: An increased number of abnormal forms (>40%) are noted. It is generally assumed that such aberrant spermatozoa are incapable of fertilization. The morphologic findings correlated with the low mortility. The findings of a large number of spermatozoa with a cytoplasmic extrusion mass could indicate epididymal disfunction. Recommendation is to repeat test.  

**My thoughts:**  
I have been recommended to a urologist and will take another semen analysis in the meantime. What is bothering me is just exactly how to interpret these results. Are they really that bad? Is the high abnormal sperm / motility of 20% that bad given that my sperm count appears to be pretty good? Any help with the interpretation would be greatly appreciated!

276,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Question portion: Last year I had two miscarriages back to back. After the first one, I went to the ER because I had, what turned out to be, a panic attack. My ER blood test showed a high TSH level (4.093). After my second miscarriage (July 2016), my gyno looked at my ER results and said my miscarriages could be due to my high TSH and put me on a low dose of Levothyroxine. I looked at my past test results and the levels were fine (2.25-2.5) and after the pills they are fine (2.1-2.8), but that one test was high. But since I have been on this medication, no pregnancy, not even miscarriages. At least when I was having miscarriages, I knew I could get pregnant, now I feel like I can't even do that. I had a Hysteroscopy in May 2017 and the RE doesn't want to see me until we have been trying six more months. I don't think that the polyp and tissue they found was the issue, I think it's the meds. Has anyone felt like their thyroid meds kept them from getting pregnant?

After the first one, I went to the ER because I had, what turned out to be, a panic attack. My ER blood test showed a high TSH level (4.093). After my second miscarriage (July 2016), my gyno looked at my ER results and said my miscarriages could be due to my high TSH and put me on a low dose of Levothyroxine. I looked at my past test results and the levels were fine (2.25-2.5) and after the pills they are fine (2.1-2.8), but that one test was high. But since I have been on this medication, no pregnancy, not even miscarriages. At least when I was having miscarriages, I knew I could get pregnant, now I feel like I can&#39;t even do that. I had a Hysteroscopy in May 2017 and the RE doesn&#39;t want to see me until we have been trying six more months. I don&#39;t think that the polyp and tissue they found was the issue, I think it&#39;s the meds. Has anyone felt like their thyroid meds kept them from getting pregnant?</p>

She wanted to come and while I appreciate the gesture and it was fun for the most part, I ended sort of regretting her being there or even knowing about our infertiltiy. 

A side note, we aren't emotionally close, though our family is somewhat ""tight knit."" I won't get into the details but she was abusive my entire life and still has episodes of being a total emotionally/verbally abusive hag followed by being pretty cool and fun. Oddly, the more frequently I hang out with her, the more infractions I seem to make that are saved up and usually hjurled at me later in some fight she picks with me. To be fair, she probably feels self conscious because the more time I spend with her, the more she annoys me. 

I think I was feeling really vulnerable awhile back and just looking for support anywhere I could get it because this infertiltiy shit is horribly lonely. It's a weird conditioned response that overrides logic. My instincts tell me to go to my mom because that's comfort, but my intellect slaps me later and reminds me she has never really been supportive of me. 

She started out being pretty supportive and encouraging about the infertility  but she isn't good with feelings and I think she can't handle my anger and hurt over it. I'm definitely in the anger phase of my grief right now. This past week she has said so many clueless and insensitive things. Some gems:

"" Not being able to have a baby isn't the same as dying,"" when I told her about the studies saying infertiltiy stress impacts people similar to chemo or HIV. 

"" You did know something was wrong, I told you to get checked out when you were younger."" When I mentioned how frustrating it was to find out about our infertility now, when we could have been saving up for IVF all this time. I replied that I did get checked out when I was younger but I wasn't trying to get pregnant and I did what they recommended (go off birth controll at least 1 year before trying). I also told her that me and my endo are not the only contributing factors to our infertility which I immediately felt guilty about.

""In a way, you did know something was wrong, didn't you"" in response to my shock last year that I had a huge ovarian cyst, needed my ovary removed, and that endo was discovered during the surgery. Again I feel like she s blaming me for not knowing these things. 

-Going on and on about how her pregnancy and delivery at age 44 with her youngest was so easy and smooth AT THE INFERTILITY walk. 

-Telling me to be careful about saying I'm infertile because I don't know yet if I am. I think she s confusing infertility with not being able to conceive via ART. 

-Telling me to be more understanding of my sister and her boyfriend because someday when we have kids, we'll expect understanding. This was on a road trip when I playfully told my husband to wait to take off to make sure my sister's ""kid mobile"" was ready to head off. That comment particularly pissed me off because I was super helpful and accomdating to my sister and her kids and entertained them all weekend whereas everyone else expected them to be little adults. 

I honestly kind of dread my mom being a grandma to my kid. She's so far up my sister and her son's butt and I probably sound crazy, but since I'm her least favorite child, my kid will probably be too. 

Sorry for the rant. I'm PMSing.  I would never bother talking to my mom about any of this because whenever I try it starts World War 3. She doesn't do feelings well and then just lashes out at me.

But I'm also kind of struggling with my partner's optimism at times, and I don't know how to respond to it when I'm feeling sad.  

I think the biggest issue is that my partner isn't experiencing the things that I am in my body.  We have had one miscarriage, one ectopic, and now our first fresh ICSI failed.  For him, the pregnancies were never quite real and the devastation that I've felt in my heart he just can't grasp.  And of course the physical reminders and processes of pregnancy loss which are painful and gory.  I know it hurts him and I know it hurts him to see my suffering, but it also upsets him.  He will be supportive and hug me and dry my tears, and knows when to be serious vs when to make me laugh.  He spoils me my doing all of the dumb things I want to do when I can't cope with anything else, and I am so grateful for that.  But at the same time, when I burst into tears and say I just can't handle anymore he says something like ""We just need to be positive and keep taking these steps.""  Our infertility coincides with a lot of other life changes for us so it's been extra hard and we're really leaning heavily on each other for support, but I can tell he feels frustrated that I'm not a bit more chin-up about things.

He seems satisfied that we have more chances with frozen embryos but I'm *UN*satisfied because nothing is a guarantee of a take-home baby. 

I'm not sure if I'm just rambling here or if anyone knows what I mean?  I want to be able to support him and let him grieve, too, however he does that best, but I also want to reality check him that we've now had three failures and just moving down the line is no guarantee of success.
