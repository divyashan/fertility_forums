1,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I apologize for the novel ahead of time. When I do something, I go all out, even when it comes to crappy medical issues. I'm 34, my husband is 40. We've been trying for just shy of 3 years (though over a year of that was on medical pause for one of our zillion issues.) We figured it was me since I knew I had Endo (diagnosed by lap) before we began. After 1 year of trying, and my Endo pain returning more and more each month, we found and Endo specialist and had a second lap. Yeah, turns out that 'mild' Endo I had was actually so severe the specialist surgeon couldn't safely remove it all in one lap. It was so bad I was covered from my kidneys down, on both sides. Awesome. Bring on 7 months of medically induced menopause via Zoladex to shrink the remainder and reduce blood loss during the next lap so my surgeon can see what the hell he's doing and get the rest of it out. 

Endo excised, we moved on to trying again. After a few months of no luck I went back to the specialist who now decides- 'Well, maybe your husband should do a SA now, just in case'. Turns out my husband has azoospermia. 3 (yes 3, not 3 million) 'non-motile', i.e. dead sperm in one sample, 0 in the second. We move on to a urologist specializing in MFI. My husband's testosterone is low, so we try meds. A few months of Armirex moves it up a smidge, 6 months of Clomid+Armidrex moves it up into normal range. Still no sperm. We switch to a urologist at my RE's clinic since we now know IVF/ICSI is our only shot. My husband has a testicular biopsy- no sperm and only a single germ cell found. He's diagnosed with Sertoli Cell only syndrome- bad news. Urologist says next step is mTESE surgery to try and find sperm with 20-30% odds of finding anything, or donor sperm. We opt for the mTESE. DH is adamantly against donor sperm. We decide to coordinate the mTESE with an IVF cycle for me because fresh testicular sperm has better odds- it doesn't freeze well. 

I begin my IVF pretesting and find out I have an AMH level of 0.3 and an AFC of 5. WTF!? Like we need another possibly insurmountable issue? IVF cycle #1 (antagonist) I use really high does of meds and barely respond- it takes until day 10 for my E2 to get over 50, but my RE continues the cycle as long as it is rising. Cycle is cancelled after 16(!) days of stims because of the 2 follicles I've grown, 1 has become dominant. RE is willing to do retrieval with 2 considering my DOR, but not 1. We can't swap the cycle to IUI as is usually done in these cases because we have no sperm. Fuck. *flushes thousands down the drain*

IVF #2 (long lupron). BCP and Lupron to get my follicles in a group, then I start the meds as high as my RE feels is safe, but again, super slow response. It takes until Day 12 for my E2 to get over 50 this time, but my first US at day 12 shows a few ok follicles, and I see a few more smaller ones that are too small to measure. I'm excited! (Big mistake) I end up growing 8 follicles, but one becomes dominant again. (Really!?!) We decide to sacrifice it and go for the group of smaller ones. Hearing its death threats, jumbo follicle chills the fuck out and I have 8 follicles of approximately the same size at trigger after 19 days of stims. Whoo hoo! 

My husband has his mTESE scheduled the next day. It ends up being an almost 4 hour surgery- I know the news is bad. Nothing found. Zip, zero zilch. I had gotten my hopes up despite our odds because of that one time a zillion years before when he had a SA with 3 dead sperm. Stupid. I still do my retrieval the next day and get 7 eggs, all mature, which go into the freezer. My husband changes his mind on the donor sperm now that we know the results of the mTESE. We move to donor sperm with my frozen eggs, which is where we're at now. Hoping my egg quality isn't crap due to the crazy long and super high stimming. Some college kid's loot sitting in the freezer chatting up my eggs. Grieving the loss of having biological offspring genetically related to both of us. Glad I found this group.

I've been spotting the last five days, finally called the RE on day 4 to see what's going on - they confirmed I never shedded my lining. I have NEVER experienced this in my life. Go figure, right before our first IVF cycle that it happens.

I was concerned that I had missed my window of opportunity for the blood work to begin the birth control medication. They scheduled me first thing yesterday morning, and told me they were going to do an ultrasound. My RE was not in, so I was seen by a different Doctor. Hooray for another instance of, “Hi, nice to meet you! Here’s my vagina.”

I explained what I have been experiencing to this new Doctor before he performed the ultrasound, and he in turn explained a few things that happen to a woman’s body when she is under a great deal of stress. The *TL;DR* is that my pituitary didn't do what it was supposed to and because of stress my body just skipped ovulation. 

The doctor also confirmed that the spotting I have been experiencing is coming from a physiologic cyst as a result from not ovulating. This also made a lot of sense, because I had a cramp yesterday that took the breath right out of me and couldn’t figure out what it was from. Something else I have never experienced. I honestly thought I was having another ectopic pregnancy, it feels almost the exact same way.

So, starting the birth control is exactly what I need to do to anyway to control the cyst. They ran my blood to see if I was able to begin, and they called yesterday afternoon to confirm that I was. 

After the ultrasound, the Doctor advised that we should be able to proceed as normal with the IVF treatment plan.  I have to take 2 pills each night for 3 days, and then move to one for the rest of the two week period. I have another appointment on May 9th to assess our progress to see if the cyst has dissipated. If so, I then wait for that cycle to begin, and they'll teach me how to do the stims. If not, they will have me take more birth control and then reassess.

I just want to scream at my pituitary. ""Seriously, dude? NOW you decide to act up?""

My period started yesterday, 3 days early, on my 7th and last IUI cycle. I'm having a really tough time. You'd think that dissapointment this many times would get easier and more routine, but it's just as bad every time. I'm on vacation from work this week, and being home with no schedule has been good an bad. The first part of the week was agonizing waiting, and the second part has been agonizing defeat. The good news is I had a to-do list about a mile long, and I'm pretty much done with all of it! I talked to someone on here last week about my goal of cleaning the gross stained caulk from around the bottom of my shower and re-caulking it. That project was a success and kept me distracted for most of a day! 

The other good news is that I just got off the phone with my RE's office about starting IVF. We had decided this was our last IUI cycle, so I had already talked to my RE a little bit about this. I was thinking I would have some more tests to get done and it would be a couple of months before we could start, but from the sound of the nurse on the phone, I've already had all the tests they will require. I thought I needed a saline sonogram (my RE mentioned this last time), but the nurse said since I've had an HSG recently that was normal and don't have a suspicion for any uterine problems, I can skip that. I am signed up for their required IVF class in a week and a half, and that's the last hurdle other than signing consent forms which they are going to email me this afternoon.

Once question I needed to ask and forgot over the phone was about suppression.

I'm new here and hoping somebody can offer me advice, or a link to a similar post and I can read up on that =)

I've been off BC for 2 years, my husband and I were married last summer and have been TTC every month since.  We started seeing an infertility doc a few months ago, did all the bloodwork, sperm count, HSG.  Everything totally normal.  I started Letrozole this month.  

I haven't told our families or friends about our struggle.  At first I thought it would be something simple and we would figure it out right away, so we just didn't want to divulge such personal problems.
2 months ago my sister got pregnant after her first try, and I was so selfishly depressed and sad for a week there after.  And really, still very sad and depressed but I'm not crying every morning now  I don't want to tell my mom or sister about my struggle because it would just take away from their happiness of the first grandchild.  I didn't realize I would have such a horrible reaction until it happened.   I hate myself for being so weak that I'm unable to be truly happy for my sister when I love her so much.

Now everywhere I turn my friends are popping up pregnant and calling with their news, and then asking me when I'm going to start trying.  I tell them all soon, and after we go on a big trip, in the fall, etc.  Then I cry and think about how it's a possibility it might not happen for us.

Now I have some more info and I need advice from some experienced ivf-ers about the next steps in the process. So here was my first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4e9a7d/hi_im_new_here/

I am 31- almost 32- my husband and I are a year into this process - had our first appt with the RE a couple weeks ago. 6 mo ago my OB/GYN did some blood work and my FSH was at 51. A couple weeks ago the RE did some additional blood work and my FSH was 31, AMH 0.052. My thyroid was slightly under active so I am on meds for that, plus the RE prescribed me estrogen b/c apparently these numbers indicate I am menopausal. This makes me feel very geriatric, but honestly after taking these the last week and a half I feel human again, so I'm not complaining. The  RE also did chromosome testing and all came back normal. All signs point to using donor eggs. 

When the nurse called me to tell me my results from the chromosome test, I asked... ok, what is the next step? I'm not sure if she was really prepared to answer that question or maybe I caught her on an off day but I feel a little confused about what is next? Do I meet with the doctor again now and ask all of my 1 million questions, or are there other tests that we might as well get out of the way before paying for another consultation appt (I have only had the blood work at this point)? Any tests that are inevitable and may inform the RE's recommendation? For example, I am worried I will schedule this appt and ask her what our odds are only to have her say, well I need to see these 3 tests first, then come back and we'll meet again. So I was hoping those that have gone through this - donor egg ivf or regular ivf - might be able to tell me some common tests required before starting? 

I did ask the RE about my husband going ahead with an SA (this is still an unknown) and she said he can do that anytime, but if we are looking at waiting for the procedure at all, we should wait on the SA b/c if it is over a year out, he will have to do another one. We don't want to wait - we are ready yesterday - but I believe there is a wait for donor eggs through this clinic and I'm not sure how long that wait is. 

tl;dr : donor eggs are my first and best option, what tests should I ask about scheduling for myself or my husband before having another consult with the RE?

I really have no idea how to explain this. I'm on my first cycle of Femara 2.5mg for infertility. This is day 2 of Femara, day 4 of my cycle. And this is the weirdest thing, I feel normal. 


And you have to understand, not just non-peroid normal but like before I had periods normal. TMI, ahead but you have to understand how amazing this is for me. I got my period at 11. Aunt Flo is a vicious vampire and I bleed to her altar like a stabbed pig. All of the women in my family tree have suffered the same way.


My cycles are painful. So painful that walking on a badly sprained ankle 5 miles a day for 9 days at Disney with a brace that rubbed a cellutis wound into my leg didn't feel all that bad. And the cellutis? Eh, I didn't bother to go in until the red streaks made it to my knee. I've been in so much pain since age 11 that nerve deep pain is still better. 


Add to my pain the amount of blood (a Diva cups worth every 15 minutes on the worse days) and anxiety that I never had before I had my period and I suffer about 2 weeks of every month. But not in the past two days. I'm taking the Femara at night and it makes me drowsy but during the day I feel like the little kid I was before Aunt Flo took a knife to her gut. I'm still cramping and bleeding but these are baby cramps compared to my usual fare. But I have energy! I'm not moody! My husband doesn't deserve to be murdered and buried in the backyard for tiny offenses! I can feel sad and not turn into a ball of tears! Not everything hurts!


And my PMS/regular anxiety, that just two days ago was crippling? Gone. 


My /r/infertility sisters (and brothers), I don't know what the f*** is going on. Maybe my body is gearing up to kill me and just giving me a few nice days to enjoy before the main event. If I don't post in a few days, someone may want to check on me. I am deeply suspicious of any kindness my body gives after 20 years of monthly torture. 


In the meantime, this is great! Did anyone else have this startling reaction to Femara? I feel like I really need to talk to my RE. I wonder if we stumbled into a clue about my infertility.

Maybe my body is gearing up to kill me and just giving me a few nice days to enjoy before the main event. If I don&#39;t post in a few days, someone may want to check on me. I am deeply suspicious of any kindness my body gives after 20 years of monthly torture. </p>

<p>In the meantime, this is great! Did anyone else have this startling reaction to Femara? I feel like I really need to talk to my RE. I wonder if we stumbled into a clue about my infertility. </p>

And my company is only about 25 people so we get no paid maternity leave.

I don't know if every doctor does it but my doctor does a Saline Infused Sonogam before fertility treatments to check for any abnormalities. I scheduled mine for May 9th and will be making a day trip down (to San Diego from Portland). 

The main stipulation as far as my cycle is that I just can't be on my period, I *shouldn't* be based on a normal cycle, but stress has been known to mess with mine, and this is definitely stressful. 

Here is my question, they want me to take birth control starting cycle day 2 until the test. When I took this test for my IVF they said it was to make absolutely sure you weren't pregnant for the test. But this time the nurse mentioned something about getting my lining ready. 

Depending on when my period starts I might only be on the pill for a couple days so I can't see it ""preparing"" anything. Being out of state and playing phone tag (and trying not to bother anyone) some questions fall through the cracks. 

If taking the pill is just to make sure I'm not pregnant then I'd rather just not have sex for that short time, but if it's actually doing something (even if it's just a few days) then I'll take it gladly. Do any of you know which it is?

However this new clinic seemed to take a much more personalized view of my IVF protocol and the first clinic just had one option. But there are some pros and cons to each clinic so I thought I'd lost them out here to get everyone's input on what they think.

Original clinic:
1) tubal ligation - current RE will perform the surgery
2) full IVF cycle, fresh transfer (50/50 ICSI split) after recovered from surgery. Freeze extra embryos included. $13,000 +$700ish for meds.
3) FET cycles are $4,600ish

New clinic:
1) freeze all cycle regardless of if I chose to do tubal ligation first or not. This is because of my polycystic ovaries increases my risk of OHSS. They also had a different protocol, not ""minimal"", but less than first clinic on dosage and or aggressiveness of stims. $16,000 + $5,000ish meds. (100% ICSI) Plus another couple hundred bucks for the first FET. 
2) Additional FETs are just under $5,000
3) tubal ligation. Don't care if I do freeze all cycle first or surgery, but they would refer me to a surgeon who would do the actual surgery.

I definitely prefer the second clinic to the first, but it's a huge cost difference and I'm not a fan that a yet to be determined dr will do the ligation. However, the second clinic does have a better lab and embryologist. 

Oh also, we are going to the Bahamas in 2 weeks and the second clinic suggests that my husband freeze his sperm before we go! Apparently they are more concerned with the man contracting Zika and his sperm being compromised than women's eggs being compromised. But dr said its all still so unknown, but it's only about $300 total to freeze and thaw the sperm, so better safe than sorry.

Firstly, [I had a lap and they found stage 3 or 4 endo](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4cikx7/trifecta_trollop_endo_update_and_my_fb_outing/). My left ovary and fallopian tube were twisted and essentially non-functioning. I had that surgery 2 weeks before our house closing.

Despite pretty kitchen pictures, this moving shit has been a fucking nightmare. Between packing, our closing being fucked up twice and getting delayed, finally moving, pretty much every appliance in our house having issues that required service, plus a million other deliveries and workers coming in and out of our house every day, even being unable to unlock our mailbox (seriously - three trips to the post office to get that worked out), *tax fraud on my husband's social security number that we found out about last weekend*, **a car wreck on Sunday while going I was going to pick up tax docs because of said fraud**, arguments with my husband over eeeee'rthing, and, you know, working 40 hours a week.... I wasn't very hopeful about this cycle. I got my freaking IUI *the day* we were moving. Well, I went in for a beta today (11DPIUI) and it's negative.

My mindset has been that it is a stepping stone to IVF. Now being in my own bullshit world of PCOS & endometriosis, with a dollop of thyroid problems and shitty morphology, I just don't have much faith that IUIs will do it for us. I've felt perfectly normal during this LP and just knew I was waiting around for the negative results.

Yet here I am. Disappointed. Drinking wine straight out of the bottle. Cheers to my fellow infertiles.

I talked to my nurse about potentially bumping up to injectables+IUI cycle and she corresponded with my RE for me - RE wants us to either do one more femara+IUI since my endo was so bad and this was only my first post-lap cycle, *or* jump to IVF. My insurance is amazing and does cover a lot of IVF (thank you technology industry job), but it requires me to do 6 medicated cycles before IVF.

I did 1 clomid before with my OBGYN, 2 femara+TI, and 2 femara+IUI. So I'm hopeful that will be 5. The clomid and TI cycles were all before I had insurance coverage, so my hope would be that they count towards the 6 required pre-IVF cycles, but I don't know for sure yet. The clinic is double checking if this past cycle was officially medicated cycle #5 *and* they're checking if my new endometriosis diagnosis doesn't change the rules for me.

I appreciate all of you here. I appreciate that I can call my mom and she immediately asks, ""ok how are we going to fix this? what do we do next?"" I appreciate that my husband still has optimism but now knows to just hug me and let me be sad. I appreciate that I will be able to move to IVF *soon* one way or another and it won't all be out of pocket. 

But right now I'm sad and broken and officially getting drunk.

TL;DR - another failed cycle - the first one post-endo where I have 2 supposedly functioning ovaries; insurance won't let me jump to IVF; RE doesn't want me to move to injectables yet; if you need to find me, I'll be at the bottom of this bottle of malbec.

*Edit to add*: and on my list of stressful shit from this month I forgot to add that two days after we moved in, [one of my closest friends told me she was pregnant](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4effah/tuesday_off_topic_thread/d1znxj5) immediately after starting to try.

An HSA (which is what I'm asking about) is where the money goes into the account with every paycheck (typically) and you only have access to what is in the account at that time, not the total amount you hope to for the year.  It also never expires, it can roll over and keep accumulating year after year.

Do I have to wait to the end of the year to take the money out to pay myself back (in part) for the IVF costs?

And do I claim the total is $17k, or whatever amount I've got left (and am trying to take out)?

59,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I fully expected to be on here every day during the stimulation phase of my 2nd IVF. Last time around, I was obsessed with learning every single thing the internet had to tell me about every single thing about IVF. We had good results on retrieval day (17 eggs, 13 fertilized), no attrition from day 1 to day 5 (but no blasts), then on day six we had 4 blasts.  A week later we learned we had nothing to transfer because they were all abnormal.

This time around, I didn't want to be on the internet at all (but I thought I would want to and joined reddit just a few weeks before the start of my stimulation phase in anticipation of all the internetting I was going to be doing). So I didn't post my progress reports, didn't read obsessively about how many follicles other redditors had on day 10, didn't try to analyze whether menopur was bad for egg quality (I was on 2 vials of menopur a day), didn't google my protocol to see whether it was typical or not. For the first time in about 2 years, I didn't think much about my infertility, even though I was getting daily scans and injections in the belly.

On retrieval day, I had 16 eggs - pretty close to last time. But this time, only 6 fertilized (used ICSI). On day 5, we had 2 blasts, which we sent for PGS testing. I had fully prepared myself for the report to come back ""all abnormal"", like last time.

We have 2 PGS- tested normal embryos.

Last time around, I was obsessed with learning every single thing the internet had to tell me about every single thing about IVF. We had good results on retrieval day (17 eggs, 13 fertilized), no attrition from day 1 to day 5 (but no blasts), then on day six we had 4 blasts.  A week later we learned we had nothing to transfer because they were all abnormal.</p>

<p>This time around, I didn&#39;t want to be on the internet at all (but I thought I would want to and joined reddit just a few weeks before the start of my stimulation phase in anticipation of all the internetting I was going to be doing). So I didn&#39;t post my progress reports, didn&#39;t read obsessively about how many follicles other redditors had on day 10, didn&#39;t try to analyze whether menopur was bad for egg quality (I was on 2 vials of menopur a day), didn&#39;t google my protocol to see whether it was typical or not. For the first time in about 2 years, I didn&#39;t think much about my infertility, even though I was getting daily scans and injections in the belly.</p>

<p>On retrieval day, I had 16 eggs - pretty close to last time. But this time, only 6 fertilized (used ICSI). On day 5, we had 2 blasts, which we sent for PGS testing. I had fully prepared myself for the report to come back &quot;all abnormal&quot;, like last time.</p>

<p>We have 2 PGS- tested normal embryos. </p>

Episona, a molecular diagnostics company based in Los Angeles, is pleased to announce a newly developed method of diagnosing male fertility by measuring epigenetic changes in sperm DNA. This study was published in the peer-reviewed journal, Fertility & Sterility (http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)01865-8/abstract). 




**WHO IS DR. HORSAGER AND DR. TUREK?**


Dr. Alan Horsager is currently the President & CEO of Episona, a molecular diagnostics company focused in men’s reproductive health. Most recently, he was a Founder and Chief Science Officer of Eos Neuroscience, a company that continues to engineer optogenetic gene therapies for blindness and chronic pain. Prior to Eos and while at the University of Southern California, he worked closely with Second Sight Medical Products to produce the first ever treatment of neurological blindness, a medical device that is now approved by the FDA for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa. Alan received his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Southern California where he currently is a visiting Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Ophthalmology. He has numerous scientific publications and issued patents, and has received several career awards including the Burroughs Wellcome Fund CASI award.



Dr. Paul Turek is an internationally known thought leader in men’s reproductive and sexual health care and research. Paul is a fellowship trained, board-certified physician by the American Board of Urology (ABU), he has received numerous honors and awards for his work and is an active member in professional associations worldwide. Dr. Turek graduated from Yale College with highest honors (summa cum laude), Phi Beta Kappa, and then attended medical school at Stanford University, where he also took top research honors. He completed his residency in urology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. 




**AMA FOCUS OF DISCUSSION**


Measuring a man’s fertility has relied on the semen analysis for over 50 years. Is this enough today? Or do the incredible advances in epigenomic medicine offer us a better way to predict male fertility potential? We encourage participation from anyone wanting to know more about epigenetics and how it can help us better understand and diagnose male infertility. We look forward to discussing how this can help you and your doctor decide on the best fertility treatments. We also welcome discussion about how environmental factors and lifestyle (smoking, etc.) can affect your sperm epigenome. You can visit this link for an overview of epigenetics: https://www.episona.com/learn/epigenetics/ 

Episona is currently conducting the validation study on a large population with world renowned fertility clinics like: SCRC, RMANJ, CCRM, CCRMT, FCSA, MINN…etc.




**PARTICIPATION IN THE AMA** 


We encourage anyone with interest in the epigenetics testing used to understand and diagnose male infertility to come along on Tuesday, April 26th and participate. If you can't make it, please reply to this post with your question or message the mods and we will make sure it's included in the AMA. If you see a question you would like to see answered please upvote it.

The relationship was ultimately doomed (he sealed that by hitting her) but it sparked a longing to be a mother. Unfortunately she found out she had PCOS and endometriosis.

My Backstory which she knows: I was diagnosed with PCOS as a teenager and told that mine was pretty bad so I will likely have problems getting pregnant.

Story: She has been overly possesive of my pregnancy. I and my husband have talked to her about it. Afterwards she will seem fine for a week or two then have a meltdown. She won't stop calling my baby ""Her adoptive/surrogate baby"", tell me she needs it be a boy because she always wanted a boy, intrude on my husband feeling the baby by running over and simply pushing him out of the way.

She tells me that I don't understand because I am not infertile. Although I honestly thought I was and it took years to have this baby. Is there something I should understand?

edit: should mention that after another one of her friends had her baby she called me crying thinking of leaving work because she couldn't calm down.

<p>Story: She has been overly possesive of my pregnancy. I and my husband have talked to her about it. Afterwards she will seem fine for a week or two then have a meltdown. She won&#39;t stop calling my baby &quot;Her adoptive/surrogate baby&quot;, tell me she needs it be a boy because she always wanted a boy, intrude on my husband feeling the baby by running over and simply pushing him out of the way. She admitted recently that she needs therapy and should go but for some reason won&#39;t. I am too the point that if she doesn&#39;t go I don&#39;t want her around my baby for her sake and the baby. She tells me that I don&#39;t understand because I am not infertile. Although I honestly thought I was and it took years to have this baby. Is there something I should understand?</p>

<p>edit: should mention that after another one of her friends had her baby she called me crying thinking of leaving work because she couldn&#39;t calm down. Then went home and drank an entire bottle of wine by herself. Also couldn&#39;t understand why she shouldn&#39;t be the one to write my baby shower thank you cards. Got angry that my Aunt was throwing my baby shower (instead of her). </p>

I saw a specialist in male infertility at a top notch medical center in my area and figured out what was going on. While the earlier urologist thought I had issues due to a varicocele and testicular atrophy, this doctor didn't think those were causing my problems. While he didn't run another SA (I've only had one that showed a count of 200k), they did run a panel for genetic issues. Lo and behold, it came back as a AZFc microdeletion on my Y Chromosome. That pretty much dashes my hopes of any treatments or surgery improving my SA numbers.

I've done some searching on this subreddit and could only find a couple of mentions about it, and the only things I can find online are research papers I'm not crazy about trying to interpret.

97,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi. I've been skittering around the edges of this community for a little while as my wife and I have been on this journey. I have azoospermia, confirmed by two SAs, my OBGYN says it's non-obstructive as all my other tests have come back normal. We were given the option to do a testicular biopsy or go straight to a mTESA. We decided to try the biopsy first though OBGYN says it's unlikely to find anything.

So basically I'm at the point right now where I'm hoping and praying there will be some sperm to extract and I'm trying to come to terms with the possibility that I might not be able to have kids that are my own. Yeah, I know, the real father is the one that's there to bandage scraped knees and give hugs, yada yada but... It's just not the same. It's a really hard thing to come to terms with. I really really want to, and my wife seems to be ok with it now, but I don't know if I can do it. I'm just waiting to hear back from the psychologist from our fertility clinic to see when she can schedule me in.

How can I describe how I'm feeling? I feel angry that we're going through this. I'm angry that the right to have children has been taken from me. It's painful to watch all our friends have kids. I'm stressed about costs, especially if we end up doing IVF. We're living comfortably right now but IVF will change that in a hurry. And even if we can do IVF, how many kids will we be able to afford going that route? One? Maybe two? We had always expected to have a large family, like 3 or 4. And this is particularly important to my wife as that was the experience she had growing up.

I feel nauseous, numb, and empty, in shock at my diagnosis. But the thing I think that is causing me the most pain is when I think about using donor sperm to create my kids. Every time it comes to my mind (and how could I think about anything else?) it's like somebody kicked me in the stomach, and the nauseous and angry feelings start all over again until I push it out of my mind and just feel numb.

Are there any other cryo-dads out there who can share with me their experience or words of wisdom? I did read [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/42rlvr/what_to_expect_with_tese/) by /u/nojustice about TESEs. I've also been reading [this blog](http://di-dad.blogspot.ca/) about life as a dad with donor inseminated kids. How did you feel about using donor sperm? Did you ever get over the fact that they're not related to you? How did your kids take it when they found out? The general impression I get is it's best to tell kids when they're young so they just know it and it's not a big deal. Did your kids show interest in contacting the donor? I should probably feel thankful toward sperm donors but instead, for some reason, I feel resentful.

You know what really seems to be bothering me about donor sperm? It's the idea that the kids might want to reach out and make contact, as if there was any sort of emotional connection whatsoever. They're just some guy that got paid to jack off into a cup. That's it. I absolutely respect that it's the kid's right to try to reach out if they want to, and honestly if I were in their situation I would probably be curious. But it's really painful for me to think about that. And it's painful to think that maybe once they find out they will fantasize and romanticize about what life would be like with ""other daddy"".

Here's another thing that stresses me out. God forbid if our marriage should fall apart. It's pretty strong and I love my wife with all of my heart but going through stuff like infertility is really hard on couples. Imagining that that happens, then I no longer have my kids with my wife, I have someone else's kids with my ex. I know that's not actually what it would be like but right now that's how it feels - I would be responsible for these kids who are wholly unrelated to me. That's a pretty stupid thought, but it's one of the things that have been going through my head.

You might play the market for just one day and end up making a killing, but that is extremely unlikely. A better strategy would be to enter it with a long-term vision, make slow and steady gains, and exit with success.

I am writing a play that involves a couple (husband and wife) that can not conceive. in the first scene, the man meets a male and female infertility specialist because his wife can not make it. He tells the man to ejaculate in a cup for sperm treatment (this is still in the first scene) so that he can send it for analysis. He refers his wife to another lab to get tests done for herself. 

In the next scene, the specialist (who is named Dr. Castillo) informs the man that he is infertile, and offers a medication that can help him. The doctor also inform him that his wife has unhealthy eggs and this is making it harder to conceive. He writes a prescription for a special medication for his wife as well. 

In the last scene, the man and wife together come back and tell the doctor that it is still not working, so the doctor tells them to try harder and prescribes different medication. There is more, but that is the gist of the infertility part. 

I was hoping to check here and see if anything mentioned above is incorrect or not how it actually is in real life. Any corrections are welcomed.

EDIT: After hearing all the feedback, I think I will change Dr. Castillo from an RE to a urologist and have only the man confer with him. Perhaps (after mentioning multiple sperm analyses in the past) the man will be diagnosed with azoospermia and be prescribed Clomid to help. Does this sound better?

 I did not even know what a urologist was before this, so thank you all!

EDIT 2: I realize I have bitten off more than I can chew. I do not know how to simulate authentic, professional conversation between Dr. Castillo and the man. I will remove Dr. Castillo entirely, and just have the man mention that he has seen a urologist, was diagnosed with oligospermia (not azoospermia!), and is taking Clomid as a treatment.

I had my first fertility evaluation at 34 years old everything looked good plumbing and hormonewise except I only had 7 antral follicles and AMH was 0.5 (US scale). My RE thought I would be a good candidate for a letrozole IUI which I tried and had two mature follicles one in each ovary but that 1st cycle failed. I then tried 3 more at home inseminations which were way more convenient and better for bonding with my wife. I knew my chances were lower with the low AFC and low AMH but I was really optimistic back then and didn't know as much as I know now about fertility. We had to take a pause mid to late last year because of my new job so my wife tried for a few months while I focused on my new job. She is in a much better camp than I am because her fertility work up showed normal everything with normal AMH and follicle count. Naturally I was both relieved at the thought that at least she didn't come back with any problems and we might be able to have a family of our own but at the same time jealous that she didn't have any problems. 
Fast forward to this past January and I'm ready to start trying again. Actually my wife and I both tried that month but failed. At this point I started taking temps and looking at cervical mucus and position and LH strips seriously. It looked like my cycles were getting shorter 28 to 26 then 24 days and I was surging early around day 8 to 10. I started taking CoQ10, vitamin D and DHEA but had two really crampy awful headache periods after trying in Jan and Feb. I asked my wife if she wanted to try in March to keep the baby ball rolling and so I could take a month off and she casually agreed both of us not thinking much of it. Welp she had a perfect cycle and is now 7 weeks pregnant.  First ultrasound looked great and the morning sickness is severe.  At first I was relieved and excited that finally all that temping and fertility tracking worked and we were finally on the road to parenthood but I also tailspinned for the past three weeks into a spiral of anxiety, sadness and twinge of jealousy that the baby baton I willingly gave to my wife is now off somewhere on some amazing journey and I don't know when I'll see it again. When I think back about the decision to ask her to try, I just didn't want to feel guilty for using up all of the vials and money and time on myself and then my wife have issues years from now. I worried that she might someday be in the position that I'm in now and i didnt want that for her. I've tried to be as supportive as I can and I'm giddy about thoughts of a little one that I can watch cartoons with and that will be just as goofy as my wife but I've noticed that there are things that trigger my sadness like when I found her first ultrasound report and saw the measurements of the embryo and pictures of the positive pregnancy strips. The comments from you guys about how you have a hard time when you hear that a friend is pregnant and complaining about morning sickness, I feel the same way! Shit, I feel like I'm a fucking ass hole every day because on the one hand my wife needs a lot of help with her two solid weeks of nausea (so far) but I also need some space to feel my sadness and also look at my options for getting pregnant some day. In one of my ugly cries I admitted that it is so hard for me to give up trying for now when my window might be closing even though it would be difficult for both of us to be pregnant at the same time and have two little ones back to back. She admitted that she wishes I would wait until she's had the baby and was disappointed that I couldn't be happier for her. Obviously she can sense my mixed feelings about the pregnancy but I can't help that. I'm worried that I may have waited too long and wasn't agressive enough with treatments. I worry about money and now timing.  I'm worried about taking away funds from our little Blobert to pursue infertility treatments and I'm worried that I won't stop feeling terrible about myself.
I decided that talking about my anxieties and options with her probably isn't going to work well which is why I'm hoping this forum can be a place to turn to when I need to express my feels.  

I'm not ready to give up on trying to get pregnant. I called and scheduled a restart of my fertility workup. So far the only thing that looks off is the AFC which actually went up slightly to 10-11. Maybe it was the DHEA?  I'm waiting for my AMH results which I expect will also be low. My doctor thinks it would be best to try IVF with PGS given my age, low AMH, and shortened cycles.  My wife thinks that we should save money and continue at home inseminations later this year or who knows, when I'm pushing 37?  It's really stressful and each time I talk about it with her I feel awful.

First, has anyone had an ectopic and had this procedure that can shed light on pain? Also, has anyone had an ectopic, had the HSG done and can shed some light on tube blockage? I am totally rambling, but I guess I just want insight whether good or bad to mentally prepare myself for this.</p>

Brand new here.  I made a new username because I want privacy while still being able reaching out to those internet strangers that can help by being someone to listen to my thoughts and rants.  Thanks in advance for that.

As far as I know, I am a healthy fertile female (confirmed by a preconception doctors appointment), with almost textbook cycles for the past 20 years, and one successful pregnancy + subsequently healthy child, 12 years ago.  I have never had a miscarriage or abortion.

I am now with a different partner, but his semen analysis was bad.  At the time of the phonecall from the clinic, the nurse explained all the numbers, but I had no context or real idea of what she meant.  I need to get a copy of the report, because I can't recall it all.  I know she said that there was low motility, low count, and that many sperm were swimming in circles, some had two heads or two tails .... as she wrapped up the phonecall, she said we would probably not be able to conceive naturally.

I know that one bad SA means that a follow up one is needed to really verify the first one.  I know there are a lot of things that can be done to improve sperm naturally with proper diet, proper medications/vitamins, abstaining from certain vices, etc.

Right now I'm left with ""Now what?""

Well, we have a follow up appointment with a urologist who specializes in infertility.  I now need to gather all the info I can on specific lifestyle changes my partner and I can do now to help improve sperm quality - any links or advice would be appreciated.

I've always wanted a boy, and my husband is the last of his family with his last name, so I know everyone was hoping we'd have at least one son.

But some backstory...

We had our first appointment with a new clinic last Thursday. I was super nervous about it because I had already started suppression for a first egg retrieval, and really wanted to continue with the cycle I was on without wasting a lot of time. I was also worried they'd put me through a bunch more testing. Luckily, they had enough information from the old clinic to proceed without further testing on my end. They did want to test my husband for Y chromosome microdeletion, and they let us know up front that if he was positive, then they would recommend against implanting any male embryos. Since we have no explanation for my husbands very low count, I expected the worst. We got the result back today, and it was negative! Assuming we have male embryos, we can implant them without going against doctor's recommendation. We can have boys without needing to start an IVF/ICSI fund for them in addition to a college fund. It worries me a little that the old clinic didn't test for this or even mention it, but I'm glad we know now and don't have to worry about it.

As for me and the new clinic, the biggest difference in this clinic is that they have BMI restrictions that the other clinic didn't. I think my weight wasn't mentioned at all at the first place. This place would prefer I lost about 30 lbs. They can proceed without the weight loss, but the schedule is very different because I need to be booked through a separate calendar than their ""normal"" patients. On top of that, since we're planning to bank embryos until we have enough for our whole family, they recommended PGS to be sure the embryos are viable (and we aren't objecting to the cost). Scheduling time in the lab for PGS pushed us out a couple of weeks for the first round as well. As a result, retrieval #1 won't be until early June (instead of mid-may). This seems worse than the first clinic, but then we looked at scheduling retrieval #2...  It'll happen at least 2 weeks earlier than it would have at the first clinic. Yay! I've jumped onto losing weight with calorie tracking and almost nightly exercise, and I've already started seeing results, so I should be ""normal"" by retrieval #2 according to my tracking app, even though I'm already scheduled as a big gal.

At this point we had already decided to move to this clinic, but then as a final bonus we had our financial consult about IVF. It's going to be cheaper here!

I'm a 31 year old female who has wanted nothing more than to become a mom for as long as I can remember.

Back in October 2013 (feels like ages ago), my husband and I decided it was time and I went off BC.  I knew it could take awhile to regulate my cycles, but instead of getting shorter/more normal, my cycles got longer and longer.  After a 60+ day cycle happened to coincide with my annual check up, I got a referral to an OB who found a 10 cm dermoid cyst that he anticipated was messing with my cycle.  It was surgically removed in May of 2014, and it took until the fall of 2014 to have normal cycles.

I got pregnant after two real cycles of trying (though my cycles are still longish around 40 days).  I had my first dating ultrasound around 6w, and was told baby had a weak heartbeat.  MCd two days later and was, to say the least, devastated.

Got pregnant again in October of 2015, and miscarried again before ever making it to my dating ultrasound.

Started seeing a specialist.  She ran a smattering of tests - genetics, SA, hormone levels - the whole 9 yards.  Everything came back normal.  Got pregnant again in March of 2016, was taking progesterone, had such high hopes.....but alas, it was not to be either.  Ended up as a MMC and my doc recommended having a D&E to test the fetal tissue for genetic abnormalities.  

So, the next step is IVF.  Doc wants us to commit do doing genetic testing, since our issue isn't getting pregnant but rather having a healthy embryo to implant.  

Emotionally, this has been a long, draining journey.  I'm not even mildly excited to start IVF - I just want to skip to the part where I can be confident that I'll get to bring a baby home with me. 

I'm happy to have an outlet to share this with others who understand, but am so very sorry that this is what we all have in common.  Best of luck to all, can't wait to get to know you.

<p>So, the next step is IVF.  Doc wants us to commit do doing genetic testing, since our issue isn&#39;t getting pregnant but rather having a healthy embryo to implant.  </p>

<p>Emotionally, this has been a long, draining journey.  I&#39;m not even mildly excited to start IVF - I just want to skip to the part where I can be confident that I&#39;ll get to bring a baby home with me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to have an outlet to share this with others who understand, but am so very sorry that this is what we all have in common.  Best of luck to all, can&#39;t wait to get to know you.  </p>

(But feel free to throw 'em at me just for funsies!) My concern is mostly about how to find the RIGHT professionals to guide me through this process. I will certainly consider any specialists my doctor recommends - but from experience, I've learned this isn't always the best way to choose a provider. 

**Here's a little about my situation:**


•We started trying in August, got pregnant right away, but it ended with a miscarriage between 6-7 weeks. 

•I'm currently going through a chemical pregnancy, which I believe is our 3rd early loss. This was our 2nd cycle trying again post-miscarriage, but we didn't get the timing right the month before. 

•I am 99% certain my FIRST miscarriage actually happened about 4 years ago. We weren't trying at the time and I was on birth control. I didn't even think to take a pregnancy test, but when my period arrived a couple of weeks late, I was pretty sure it was a miscarriage. After losing our first planned pregnancy this fall, I am now quite sure.

•I was diagnosed with PCOS around 10 years ago (when I was 21 - I'm now 31). After a couple of years on birth control and weight loss, my cycles have been pretty regular for the past 5-6 years. I'm definitely ovulating, although I suspect there are hormonal problems and/or other PCOS-related issues at play here. 

•I also have Raynaud's Disease - I have no idea if there's any connection to IF/RPL, but since it has to do with blood and circulation, a link between the two doesn't seem TOO improbable.

Also, can you try to save the chocolate for me? No? Ok, cool, had to ask."" 

NOTE: I know most doctors are brilliant professionals who put their patients first, it's just something that makes me nervous, especially since infertility is such a lucrative field with a precarious and emotional power dynamic between patients and providers.  I'm also not saying that IVF+PGD is out of the question for the future, it's just not where we'd want to start.


**I'm having a hard time finding anywhere that seems to specialize in recurrent pregnancy loss.  I'm especially interested in hearing from anyone in the Boston/New England area that may have similar experiences and/or recommendations.** 

The Center for Infertility and Reproductive Surgery at Brigham and Women's specifically mentions a ""recurrent pregnancy loss program"" - we've contacted them and hope to do a consult. That's really the only place I've found that advertises itself as addressing RPL specifically. Is there anyone local who has another suggestion? We can drive a couple hours in any direction for the right place.


If you aren't local, is there anyone who has similar experiences with RPL and has a suggestion on types of places to look for? Or advice on how to find the right clinic/questions to ask/things to look out for/etc.? Am I even looking at the right things? Infertility clinics? Reproductive endocrinologists? Private practices? Hospital centers? ""Recurrent pregnancy loss specialist/amazing human with medical degree"" is turning up a disappointing number of hits on google. 

It's all so overwhelming. Thanks for reading my novel. Having a place to pose these long-winded, nebulous questions, makes it all a little easier - so thank you. :)

(But feel free to throw &#39;em at me just for funsies!) My concern is mostly about how to find the RIGHT professionals to guide me through this process. I will certainly consider any specialists my doctor recommends - but from experience, I&#39;ve learned this isn&#39;t always the best way to choose a provider. </p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s a little about my situation:</strong></p>

<p>•We started trying in August, got pregnant right away, but it ended with a miscarriage between 6-7 weeks. </p>

<p>•I&#39;m currently going through a chemical pregnancy, which I believe is our 3rd early loss. This was our 2nd cycle trying again post-miscarriage, but we didn&#39;t get the timing right the month before. </p>

<p>•I am 99% certain my FIRST miscarriage actually happened about 4 years ago. We weren&#39;t trying at the time and I was on birth control. I didn&#39;t even think to take a pregnancy test, but when my period arrived a couple of weeks late, I was pretty sure it was a miscarriage. After losing our first planned pregnancy this fall, I am now quite sure.</p>

<p>•I was diagnosed with PCOS around 10 years ago (when I was 21 - I&#39;m now 31). After a couple of years on birth control and weight loss, my cycles have been pretty regular for the past 5-6 years. I&#39;m definitely ovulating, although I suspect there are hormonal problems and/or other PCOS-related issues at play here. </p>

<p>•I also have Raynaud&#39;s Disease - I have no idea if there&#39;s any connection to IF/RPL, but since it has to do with blood and circulation, a link between the two doesn&#39;t seem TOO improbable. </p>

<p>On one hand, I&#39;m happy that we seem to be able to get pregnant on our own easily.

I had my HSG on 3/7 that officially diagnosed me as bilateral tubal disease with left hydrosalpinx. Prognosis=IVF only option for biological children. On 3/31 I had an US that showed the hydrosalpinx, clear as day, so I have to have it removed/clipped/taken care of before IVF. This means surgery and a 3 month wait there after before we can begin.

I know that we have practically 0 chance to conceive naturally, but I also know:
1) there is an increase in conception after an HSG
2) I ovulated (spontaneously, for the first time since TTC) out of my shittiest tube last cycle (3DPO US confirmed). So better chance of ovulating out of the other one this time?

Hubby and I started trying in November of 2014. We were hopeful I somehow got pregnant towards the last of my Depo shot round. Fast forward to now, still no pregnancies.

I whole-heartedly regret the decision to start Depo in the first place because I nearly blame it for all the trouble I've had conceiving. While I started my period fairly quickly after stopping Depo, it has been a rollercoaster of hell since then. Ranging from 20 day cycles to 40 day cycles, to huge blood clots, to severe pain, to not ovulating, to many many more things. 

Right now I have gotten to the point where I am not trying any supplements because I feel like they didn't help but am thinking of adding different things to my regime. I'm currently exercising daily (whether it's a walk or a jog or a hike) and am trying to eat better (it's hard!) and getting 8 hours of sleep. My husband isn't doing anything aside from trying to remain stress free and getting enough sleep. He smokes occasionally and we both drink about 2-3 times a week (nothing more than 4 beers at a time). He is willing to do a SA which I think will be our next step right now.

Went last Tuesday 4-5, for CD 12 follicle scan.  Big fat nothing! No mature follicles at all.  So IUI #3 went down the tube in a hurry.  Looks like IVF is our only option going forward.<br/>
Next Sunday is my birthday! Yay right?!  Nope.  Also happens to be the 5 year anniversary of my last miscarriage at 13 weeks.  So dealing with that as well which fucking sucks.  I mean, my birthday has sucked ass since it happened but there is something about the fact that it has been 5 years that just makes it extra shitty this year.

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and PCOS at 16 and 17 years of age, currently 31. I've been on metformin and synthroid since with some hormonal birth control thrown in for good measure along the way. Most recently, I had an IUD, otherwise I haven't been on the pill since an awesome bout of colitis in 2010.

Anyway, by some miracle I conceived my nearly three year old very quickly and had a pretty unremarkable pregnancy up until the end when preeclampsia showed up. At any rate, the current research seems to show that I should have been treated as high risk, but I was not.

My most recent pregnancy ended in a missed abortion in February. I'm now basically a disaster with thinking that the MC was caused by the PCOS or my thyroid or something. I'm now wondering if I should have consulted with a RE in addition to my OBGYN who seems to blow off all of my concerns with PCOS. I seem to have relatively regular cycles, but they are pretty long and I ovulate three weeks into them, resulting in a pretty short luteal phase.

At any rate, am I overreacting by wanting to be seen by a RE? Is this even worth a consultation or do I just need to calm down?

The bad news is the obvious question...why didn't we know that?  Turns out no one has ever seen my left ovary.  In scans they always have trouble finding it, but they usually conclude it's super tiny and hiding behind other stuff.  Today the nurse decided that my estrogen was really high, and it was weird I only had the 2 follicles, so she wanted to get a good look at the left one.

So now we're faced with the decision of whether to just keep trying the old fashioned way, or try Clomid+IUI.

Got my OPK surge alert yesterday, looked at hubby and was like, ""Let's take this cycle off and just go into the IVF with a good energy."" So we did.

And it feels GREAT. Two extra weeks of not having to to ""tone down"" workouts. Of being able to use the sauna and take hot baths. Most importantly, of not having at least five moments per day with that slight nagging ""What if..."" and then three-four days of full blown ""checking my underwear hourly just in case"" while I wonder if this will be the month my period comes and/or if it's yet another chemical.

I'm absolutely sure we made the right call because I'll just be in a better mind space for this IVF cycle. More importantly, it got me more fired up about donor eggs if this cycle fails (I know DE aren't a sure solution but our only issue is egg quality/quantity and our selected donor has given others a successful pregnancy before, so I feel pretty confident) because I am ready to get off this train.

Got my OPK surge alert yesterday, looked at hubby and was like, &quot;Let&#39;s take this cycle off and just go into the IVF with a good energy.&quot; So we did.</p>

<p>And it feels GREAT. Two extra weeks of not having to to &quot;tone down&quot; workouts. Of being able to use the sauna and take hot baths. Most importantly, of not having at least five moments per day with that slight nagging &quot;What if...&quot; and then three-four days of full blown &quot;checking my underwear hourly just in case&quot; while I wonder if this will be the month my period comes and/or if it&#39;s yet another chemical.</p>

<p>I&#39;m absolutely sure we made the right call because I&#39;ll just be in a better mind space for this IVF cycle. More importantly, it got me more fired up about donor eggs if this cycle fails (I know DE aren&#39;t a sure solution but our only issue is egg quality/quantity and our selected donor has given others a successful pregnancy before, so I feel pretty confident) because I am ready to get off this train. I want to just <em>be in my life.</em> Not visit my life while my brain is somewhere else.</p>

Our conversation was around a new job that he has, that may offer the possibility of working overseas for a time. We previously lived and worked overseas for 2 years years prior to our ttc history. At the time I loved the adventure and didn't miss my friends or family and wasn't fussed when I got back, I did see people ect, but I wasn't homesick and desperate to see people the second we got home.

What support do they give us in our struggles that we would miss? And I realised that it is only a feeling of obligatory sadness that I would have, that you are 'supposed' to miss these people when you aren't around them.

It then made me sad to realise that 5 years into infertility I have no friends in my life that reach out to me in anyway that I would miss if I moved.

It would literally take 15 minutes. Today I&#39;m having another IUI, but since it&#39;s a Saturday and my OB is closed, we are having my RE do the IUI for the first time. I got here at 8am, they checked me in, and then they said it would be 30 minutes to an hour to &quot;prepare the sperm&quot;. What are they doing, and it is necessary? Did my OB skip a step that prevented my IUIs from being successful? I did get pregnant once from my OB&#39;s IUI, but it was a blighted ovum. Now I&#39;m freaking out that I could have wasted time and money on 6 IUIs if she missed doing something! Or is there really nothing to do since the sperm I bought is already washed? Help! Anybody know anything about this?</p>

So quick (?) recap.

* Prescription submitted by my nurse to CVS on 3/9
* I call CVS on 3/11 to make sure they got the prescription, person I talk to says yes
* I call CVS on 3/16 to just check in (I'm in no rush because I don't start IVF until April so I'm trying not to be pushy) - they say that it's being processed through Benefits, I say great
* I call CVS on 3/24 to check in again, this time I'm told wow, looks like this prescription was never assigned to anyone, it's just been sitting there.  No account manager, no benefits.  I've been lied to repeatedly.  They assign it right away.
* My CVS account manager calls me on 3/25, very apologetic, they're all over it.  BUT it has to go to benefits, who need a prior authorization from my dr.  They've faxed the forms to my dr.  I call my nurse, let her know as a head's up, she says no prob, she'll tell her medical coordinator to look out for them.
* 3/30 AM my nurse tells me the medical coordinator took care of the prior authorization form on Tuesday (3/29).  3/30 afternoon I get a call from CVS that Menopur and Gonal-F were denied because according to the prior authorization form, I have completed ZERO cycles of Clomid.  Which isn't true, I've completed 3 cycles - 2 with them, 1 with my OB/GYN.  I also had completed 3 cycles of Letrozole.  Med coordinator is a moron and actually wrote ""0.""  So now I have to appeal.
* 3/31 I ask my nurse to submit the appeal stating that I've done these cycles.  She says she'll have the medical coordinator do it.
* 4/1 I check in to make sure it was submitted, and nurse says that medical coordinator can't submit cycles done anywhere other than there (referring to the 1 Clomid cycle) and tells me that insurance doesn't accept Letrozole, only Clomid, because that's what the rejection says.  I call CVS and they tell me they'll totally accept Letrozole, in fact I only need to prove 1 failed cycle of Letrozole in lieu of 3 failed Clomid.  I call my nurse back, tell her this, and she begrudgingly agrees to tell the medical coordinator to just list all of my completed Clomid AND Letrozole cycles so we can just be done with it all.
* 4/4 I call nurse again, to make sure the appeal was submitted.  She says she thinks the medical coordinator might be out today, and she's out tomorrow, so I should call back Wednesday.
* 4/5 I call CVS to see if they've gotten anything re: an appeal, nope.
* 4/6 I try to call my nurse and apparently she took Wednesday off too.  I basically demand an appointment with my nurse the next day so we can just work this all out.  I'm told they can, but also that the medical coordinator apparently did submit an appeal on 4/4, and CVS is still saying they haven't gotten any appeal.
* 4/7 I meet with my nurse, get a copy of the ""appeal"" that was sent, and it seriously is 100% wrong.  It doesn't mention Menopur or Gonal-F, it actually says I WILL BE taking Clomid, and I WILL BE taking Letrozole, and these drugs need to be approved.  I sit there in my nurse's office while she goes back and forth with the medical coordinator (who I still haven't met or talked to, they keep her behind some magical curtain which is probably a good thing because I may punch her at this point).  Finally after 3 new drafts, the letter accurately reflects 2 Clomid cycles, 3 Letrozole cycles.  I go straight to UPS Store at about 3:30pm and fax that letter along with my own cover page citing the right account info, appeal #, and a letter explaining the error.  I pay $1.50 PER PAGE to fax this shit because UPS Store sucks.  I write URGENT all over the front.  
* 4/8 (today) I got a call from CVS at 11:30am already telling me the appeal was accepted and I'm FINALLY approved!  I've got to say, I was pretty surprised by the fast turnaround there.  Less than 24 hours!

So after all that, frankly, CVS only dropped the ball in the beginning with getting my prescription assigned.  Since that point, all issues have been with the medical coordinator at my clinic who is dumb as shit.  I can't believe this is her actual job.

Anyway, as of this moment, I have officially paid for my meds and they are set to be delivered on Tuesday!  FINALLY!  As hellish and frustrating as it was to deal with all this shit, I at least know it was worth it because I was able to get all my meds for less than $600 total.  But the hours I spent on the phone and the anxiety it gave me were not a nice price to pay for those savings.  If only my clinic had filled out the prior authorization form correctly from the get-go, we would have avoided all of this.

I call my nurse back, tell her this, and she begrudgingly agrees to tell the medical coordinator to just list all of my completed Clomid AND Letrozole cycles so we can just be done with it all.</li>
<li>4/4 I call nurse again, to make sure the appeal was submitted.  She says she thinks the medical coordinator might be out today, and she&#39;s out tomorrow, so I should call back Wednesday.</li>
<li>4/5 I call CVS to see if they&#39;ve gotten anything re: an appeal, nope.</li>
<li>4/6 I try to call my nurse and apparently she took Wednesday off too.  I basically demand an appointment with my nurse the next day so we can just work this all out.  I&#39;m told they can, but also that the medical coordinator apparently did submit an appeal on 4/4, and CVS is still saying they haven&#39;t gotten any appeal.</li>
<li>4/7 I meet with my nurse, get a copy of the &quot;appeal&quot; that was sent, and it seriously is 100% wrong.  It doesn&#39;t mention Menopur or Gonal-F, it actually says I WILL BE taking Clomid, and I WILL BE taking Letrozole, and these drugs need to be approved.  I sit there in my nurse&#39;s office while she goes back and forth with the medical coordinator (who I still haven&#39;t met or talked to, they keep her behind some magical curtain which is probably a good thing because I may punch her at this point).  Finally after 3 new drafts, the letter accurately reflects 2 Clomid cycles, 3 Letrozole cycles.  I go straight to UPS Store at about 3:30pm and fax that letter along with my own cover page citing the right account info, appeal #, and a letter explaining the error.  I pay $1.50 PER PAGE to fax this shit because UPS Store sucks.  I write URGENT all over the front.<br/></li>
<li>4/8 (today) I got a call from CVS at 11:30am already telling me the appeal was accepted and I&#39;m FINALLY approved!  I&#39;ve got to say, I was pretty surprised by the fast turnaround there.  Less than 24 hours!</li>
</ul>

<p>So after all that, frankly, CVS only dropped the ball in the beginning with getting my prescription assigned.  Since that point, all issues have been with the medical coordinator at my clinic who is dumb as shit.  I can&#39;t believe this is her actual job.</p>

<p>Anyway, as of this moment, I have officially paid for my meds and they are set to be delivered on Tuesday!  FINALLY!  As hellish and frustrating as it was to deal with all this shit, I at least know it was worth it because I was able to get all my meds for less than $600 total.  But the hours I spent on the phone and the anxiety it gave me were not a nice price to pay for those savings.  If only my clinic had filled out the prior authorization form correctly from the get-go, we would have avoided all of this.</p>

<p>Happy weekend to you all!</p>

*************************************************************************************

(Last two paragraphs have questions for the sub... the remainder is just random info/ranting).  

After a few years of TTC #1 naturally, then 3-4 months of letrozole, then 3 failed IUIs, my husband (31) and I (35) finally pulled the trigger today on our first round of IVF.  We apparently are ""excellent"" candidates - unexplained infertility, good on egg counts, ""A+++++ sperm"" etc.  We were also ""excellent"" candidates for IUI - and that didn't work out so great.  So we'll see.

Treatment will be at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.  We live in the Twin Cities, so it will be a bit of a haul to get there for all the monitoring appointments, but I really like my doctor and the staff there (aside from the evil nurse with the gigantic speculum).  

Mayo doesn't publish pricing for IVF on their website, so I was only able to get it in person today.  For those that our curious, here is the breakdown - 

$9,900 package which includes the orientation visit, induction, ultrasounds, retrieval, anesthesia, embryo culture, and embryo transfer.  It doesn't include embryo cryopreservation ($690), oocyte cryopreservation ($1,565), IVF lab services - ($330 for sperm prep), medications (varies), or embryo storage ($400/year).  

We have a $7000 per person lifetime fertility benefit through our health insurance.  Unfortunately most of the expenses are on my side, and apparently we can't have the husband billed for anything but the sperm collection/transfer.  That said, after the IUIs we've done, I have about $4,000 left of my benefit, and he has $6,100 remaining.  So that's good.

Medications are a bitch.  We have a $3,500 lifetime fertility prescription benefit, but it's administered through CVS / Caremark.  What a complete nightmare that has been today -- just trying to get basic questions answered.  Apparently I need to do the following - 

1) Get the prescriptions, and have them faxed to Caremark.

2) Call Caremark, give them all the information that was on the prescriptions.

3) Wait for Caremark to complete a pre-authorization form for each medication, which they send to the physician.

4) Physician completes their pre-authorization form and sends it back.

5) Caremark reviews with a team and decides if they want to approve coverage.

6) If approved, I call to set up a profile with the profile team.

7) The profile team sends me to the pre-authorization team to confirm the medications.

8) The pre-authorization team then sends me to the pharmacy team to discuss the medications and arrange for delivery.  

9) Medications apparently are delivered.  

I have no idea why this many steps are necessary.  It's ridiculous. 

Anyways -- In reviewing medication options it looks like the FSH will be the most expensive.  I'm asking my doctor about Brevelle - which was recalled and I'm not sure if it's back on the market, as it's over $1,000 cheaper than Gonal-F, and almost $2,000 cheaper than Follistim.  Any comments on this would be appreciated.  

Any advice from the group on anything related to IVF... ""things I wish I'd known before I started"" sort of thing would be greatly appreciated.  I feel like I'm in good hands with my doctor, but I've lurked on here long enough to appreciate the great comments coming from the community.

So my husband and I went through IUI #1 last fall. It ended in a presumed ectopic. With the interim three month wait, we decided to travel to Italy as a consolation prize. Then we would start again. Right? Right. Except I loved traveling. I want to do more of it. Non-baby friendly stuff like Africa and Morocco, take the train through Europe, etc. 

But I also really want a baby, I think. I furiously scroll past FB pictures and announcements of friends who are mostly on their second or third kid. A coworker brought her 2 month old in to work for a visit and I had to excuse myself to have a good cry in the bathroom. (Her work baby shower coincided with my initial beta drop, lots of feels there.) 

Then my thoughts circle around and I'm wanting to travel again. And feeling like an awful person for crying and whinging over babies and infertility because I know some people who literally want nothing more than to have a baby, and I want so many different things at different times with differing levels of desire. And then the desire to travel gets muddied with some of my fears about the painful IUI process, worries about having a baby that will turn into a healthy adult (my husband and I both have some issues)...

And I just feel so lost. For various reasons, I feel like I've wasted the last decade of my life and am now trying to play catch-up.

I'm starting to have tender/tingly boobs, and I cannot drink enough water (seriously - feeling dehydrated/thirsty just...all the time), which also means I'm peeing like a madwoman. The bloat is also beginning, and I'm starting to just feel generally achy/crampy/full in my lower abdomen.  I have lots of follicles growing and they're all at an appropriate size right now (I have one 13mm, a handful of 9-10-11's, and some small stuff) I think most of my aches and pains are definitely a result of being over-tired.  

So my big question is this.  I took the day off work on Friday because OMG VICTORY PARADE IN PHILLY!  This will be stim day 10 - so ideally we'll be right in the home stretch and I will be at the height of my hormone-induced misery.  We're going to try to carefully plan it so that I'm never too far from a bathroom, and the parade itself should only involve an hour or two of standing out on the street before we can clear out of the area and settle down someplace to eat lunch.

I&#39;m starting to have tender/tingly boobs, and I cannot drink enough water (seriously - feeling dehydrated/thirsty just...all the time), which also means I&#39;m peeing like a madwoman. The bloat is also beginning, and I&#39;m starting to just feel generally achy/crampy/full in my lower abdomen.  I have lots of follicles growing and they&#39;re all at an appropriate size right now (I have one 13mm, a handful of 9-10-11&#39;s, and some small stuff) I think most of my aches and pains are definitely a result of being over-tired.  </p>

<p>So my big question is this.  I took the day off work on Friday because OMG VICTORY PARADE IN PHILLY!  This will be stim day 10 - so ideally we&#39;ll be right in the home stretch and I will be at the height of my hormone-induced misery.  We&#39;re going to try to carefully plan it so that I&#39;m never too far from a bathroom, and the parade itself should only involve an hour or two of standing out on the street before we can clear out of the area and settle down someplace to eat lunch.

We got the results of our beta test this morning on nine days past a five day transfer. 

Zero. 

We decided to jump right back on the  damned (IF) horse that threw us and we were able to bump up our April 20 WTF appointment to Tuesday. 

One frozen embryo remains. We are considering a natural-cycle FET. Drugs just don't do well in my Tylenol-free temple (...naturopath, here).

Just ripped off my estrogen patches and about to get down with a whiskey sour on my day off (naturopath who needs a damned drink, here). 

Someone else had mentioned sangria so that might be dinner...I might even throw an entire pineapple off the bridge near my house, and slingshot Brazil nuts from my rooftop deck. 

Then we will take care of ourselves tomorrow and try again. But seriously -- f*ck you, infertility. We did all the right things. Of course. 

And screw people who look at ""us lesbians"" like we don't have the same struggles as straight folk. Waltzing into the clinic and putting the feet up and coming out with a baby hasn't happened...eight times now. Not that any of you pass judgment or at least I hope you don't... Yes we have two uteruses (uterii??) but no we don't have double the odds. Wife would get preg ONLY to make me happy -- but she would prefer to get tossed off the deck with the Brazil nuts than be heavy with child. 
I couldn't ever ask that of her. I wouldn't/won't.

However every time my husband gives me shots (we did sub-q HCG for our IUIs), somehow my nerves and the complete absurdity of the situation overwhelm me and I start laughing and cannot stop. 

It’s extremely annoying because of course my belly jiggles all over the place and he can’t do the shot until I stop, which takes seriously 5-10 minutes. I cannot imagine going through this every night for every stim cycle. I need help.

Some points to consider:

* 1)	Yes I could do the shots myself and this would probably solve the problem. However I like giving him a job and having him involved. I think I might get resentful if I feel like I have to do everything by myself, so I’d like to try to make this work first.

* 2)	I am a very experienced meditator and all my training to be still and listen to my breath and be in the moment etc etc has not so far helped me for shit. I do zazen which is pretty stripped down – if anyone is familiar with a method that has more bells and whistles (visualizations or even something guided on youtube) that might help.

* 3)	We do the shots in my stomach with me laying in bed. I think laying down makes things worse because I can feel myself laughing and it feeds the response. All our shots are going to be sub-q – is there some other position or body part (and not an inherently funny one like my ass) I could try?

* 4)	I would love to know that this has happened to someone else.

Husband is 8 years younger than me, but had a varicocele which we knew could impair his fertility too.  I wanted him to get his sperm counts checked, but his *doctor* resisted running the tests for awhile because he was so certain the problem just *had* to be with my age (apparently husband's doctor found his medical license in the back of a cab, but I digress.)  When tests were finally run on H it was determined (surprise, surprise) that he had very poor sperm count due to several varicoceles (a few were hiding I guess).  So we schedule surgery on H and then wait to see if it works (it did, mostly, but that wasted us another 7-8 months).

So we start trying again and bupkis.  Next stop, IVF--with donor eggs, because I refuse to drop thousands of dollars coaxing H's borderline sperm into my ancient gametes.

Because impatience. 

One embryo remains on ice but was ""slow"" to develop and not sure at day5 if it would be viable. 

Clinic has 37% live birth rate with FET frozen donor embryo (we are doing reciprocal) and 56% fresh DE. 

Prepared to get the ""it's too early"" speech from coordinator. I'd be less mad if someone gave it to me, here.

After the first 9 months she insisted we both get ourselves checked out. Come to find out that I had literally no sperm count. Had a testicular biopsy after taking clomid for several weeks and the doc said that its a lack of production issue. 

We are not a family of means that could afford IVF, so we decided to go with a sperm donor. Instead often anonymous one, she opted to use a childhood friend who lives 100 miles away. We did 2 rounds of IUI to no avail. The clinic was required to freeze his sample and then thaw it prior to use which I think made it unusable. So, for the last few months she's been going to see him when she's ovulating and doing a home insemination. 

I tagged along on the last time since she has been asking me to go with her. It was super awkward. He went into the restroom and put his sample into a specimen cup she provided and she puts it in a soft cup thing and inside her. 

I can't help but feel completely left behind in some ways and inadequate. I know there's other guys who go through this kind of thing, but y'know us guys aren't exactly encouraged to discuss our feelings. She has a tremendous support group of girls she's met online, but I'm really introverted and I guess I just don't know how to talk about these kinds of things. 

I feel like the best thing in our relationship would be for her to get pregnant and for us to have a tiny human to focus on instead of what we haven't been able to do. What's most important to me is her happiness. Mine will come when I'm being super silly with the kid. I have a feeling I'll be just fine when I get to be a daddy even though I'm not a father.
