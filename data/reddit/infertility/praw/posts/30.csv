I basically just wanted to check in with people in a similar situation as me to see if I'm being overly sensitive about a situation. I just don't know... A part of me is really hurt but a part of me thinks I'm overreacting. Sorry if I ramble.

I was on Facebook and saw a post from my aunt. Apparently there is now one of those online tests that will tell you which one of your friends will be pregnant next. So, my aunt did this test and her result was my cousin (her daughter), who just had a baby in January. When I went to the comments, it was all my aunt, cousin and sister joking around about getting pregnant. My sister said she was glad it wasn't her and my cousin said she'd ""take one for the team"". My cousin did the test and commented her answer, which was my aunt. They all had a good laugh at the idea of my aunt having a baby. 

I just burst into tears after reading it. I couldn't help but think I wish I could ""take one for the team"" or wonder what would they have thought if I was the result.

I find I'm pretty thick skinned when it comes to my infertility and don't often get hurt by things. But something about this just really hurt me. I just expected them to be a bit more considerate. I by no means expect them to tip toe around me but it just felt so.. I don't know.

Since we technically already paid for it, the clinic is 10 min away from home and this is a new step for us, we have decided to just...do it and see if we are successful this way! We are an unexplained infertility case and my husband usually has good quality sperms so we&#39;ll hope cleaning them for the top ones will help a bit my case! Also, since my LH is already quite high, my insemination will be tomorrow instead of Sunday so I&#39;ve took my Ovidrel around noon and my IUI will be tomorrow at 11:30 am. </p>

22,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Well, I'm triggering tonight and sitting here in tears after my final monitoring appointment. It looks like we have maximum 8 follicles ready for retrieval. Which means if it's anything like last round, half will fertilize and half of those again will be gone by day 3. Meaning with maybe 1 or 2 on day 3 this round and the 2 frozen on day 3 last time, it won't be worth doing PGS yet. (Plan is day 3 PGS with transfer on day 5.) Unless some miracle occurs.

I just don't get why things are so different compared to the first two rounds I did just 6/7 months ago.


I had 13 retrieved and all fertilized on round #1.(failed fresh transfer- of 3 on day 3. None frozen)


I had 15 retrieved and 10 fertilize on round 2. (Fresh transfer of 3 blasts ended in mc. None frozen)


Then I switched clinics and decided to do PGS.


I had 9 retrieved and 5 fertilize for round 3. ( no transfer, froze 2 on day 3)


And now round 4, I might get 8 retrieved if I'm lucky and fuck knows how many will last. RE said the main issue is embryo quality due to the MFI so he strongly recommends not skipping PGS


The difference between the two clinics is two things. The first clinic did a biopsy and used sperm from that. Second used fresh samples.


And the meds are different. First clinic had me stim daily with Gonal plus some luveris mixed in. 

Second clinic is menopur daily plus Gonal only on the first 3 days of stims.


My RE said we can try the old protocol if we want next time, but that the meds ""all do the same thing"".  .

But results show that I did better on Gonal/luveris . I don't know what to think. 


For this round, I guess we should just plan to freeze all and not do a transfer. (Which breaks my fucking heart because I thought I'd get to transfer). If by some miracle we have enough for PGS, I guess I could always do a FET next month.


And then he said prob December for next stim round to give my ovaries a break. That will be IVF/ ER #5, a number which makes me want to vomit. Ugh. I guess I could switch back to the Gonal protocol for that one and also maybe see if we can get my hubs frozen biopsy transferred to the new clinic and use that sperm.

What would your game plan be?

It's hard because some part of me thought that if I could be pregnant before my due date in December then that would somehow make it better. I should be having my baby in December, not doing round fucking 5 of IVF.

My RE today did say he realized how stressful and disappointing this must be and that a break would be good. And that it's important to get stress levels down. It's nice to have that recognized. 

I guess my decision now is do I want to take progesterone on Saturday after ER just in case? Or force my hand to wait by not taking it?

Fuck, this massively sucks, you guys. I'm so fucking sick of this shit. 

***edit***

We are doing ICSI and have done for all rounds. 

The clinic can biopsy on day 3 and have PGS results in 36-48 hours. So they can actually fresh transfer a PGS tested embryo on day 5. 
For the ones frozen on day 3, they will thaw, biopsy and let grow to day 5 . Then transfer or refreeze if they are extra normals. This is because we have never had our blasts make it to freeze. So you still can have a fresh transfer option even with PGS.

It looks like we have maximum 8 follicles ready for retrieval. Which means if it&#39;s anything like last round, half will fertilize and half of those again will be gone by day 3. Meaning with maybe 1 or 2 on day 3 this round and the 2 frozen on day 3 last time, it won&#39;t be worth doing PGS yet. (Plan is day 3 PGS with transfer on day 5.) Unless some miracle occurs.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get why things are so different compared to the first two rounds I did just 6/7 months ago.</p>

<p>I had 13 retrieved and all fertilized on round #1.(failed fresh transfer- of 3 on day 3. None frozen)</p>

<p>I had 15 retrieved and 10 fertilize on round 2. (Fresh transfer of 3 blasts ended in mc. None frozen)</p>

<p>Then I switched clinics and decided to do PGS.</p>

<p>I had 9 retrieved and 5 fertilize for round 3. ( no transfer, froze 2 on day 3)</p>

<p>And now round 4, I might get 8 retrieved if I&#39;m lucky and fuck knows how many will last. RE said the main issue is embryo quality due to the MFI so he strongly recommends not skipping PGS</p>

<p>The difference between the two clinics is two things. The first clinic did a biopsy and used sperm from that. Second used fresh samples.</p>

<p>And the meds are different. First clinic had me stim daily with Gonal plus some luveris mixed in. </p>

<p>Second clinic is menopur daily plus Gonal only on the first 3 days of stims.</p>

<p>My RE said we can try the old protocol if we want next time, but that the meds &quot;all do the same thing&quot;.  .</p>

<p>But results show that I did better on Gonal/luveris . I don&#39;t know what to think. </p>

<p>For this round, I guess we should just plan to freeze all and not do a transfer. (Which breaks my fucking heart because I thought I&#39;d get to transfer). If by some miracle we have enough for PGS, I guess I could always do a FET next month.</p>

<p>And then he said prob December for next stim round to give my ovaries a break. That will be IVF/ ER #5, a number which makes me want to vomit. Ugh. I guess I could switch back to the Gonal protocol for that one and also maybe see if we can get my hubs frozen biopsy transferred to the new clinic and use that sperm.</p>

<p>What would your game plan be?</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard because some part of me thought that if I could be pregnant before my due date in December then that would somehow make it better. I should be having my baby in December, not doing round fucking 5 of IVF.</p>

Been lurking a while and just want to throw out a big appreciation to all of you who speak about the real, ugly, raw and trauma of this whole thing. It’s refreshing to see discussions without spending half my time trying to figure out what the hell people mean with the alphabet soup of acronyms and nausea inducing names for things.

Anyway, I’m the male half of our infertility bullshit (I’m actually much more than half of the issue…my damn sperm suck at their jobs). It does seem to mostly women here, so I hope it is ok for me to jump in the fray. My wife and I met little later in our lives and I am 40 and she is 38, but in the last few years of hoping for just one swimmer to find his way, the doc is now starting to get worried about egg reserve.

All that said, we are about 98% of the way there to deciding to do an IVF cycle that would start in a few weeks and continue to go through big swings of emotions, anger, second thoughts, etc. New questions keep coming up as well, but the most prevalent right now that I thought this group could help us with are about meds and pharmacies.

*Our clinic says that don’t trust overseas pharmacies because “the meds all come from the eastern bloc”, and they don’t think quality control is there. We are paying the whole thing out of pocket and meds at places like IVFprescription.com and others are about half the price of the places they want us to go. What is the wisdom of this group on that?

*Also, in our proposed calendar, my job has me needing to be out of town for 3 days during the stim cycle. How much is my wife going to be cursing my name as she is being a pincushion without me there?
Thanks, and sorry about the wall of text!

For whatever reason they came from the pharmacy with 18, 22, and 25 ga (1-1/2"") needles.  My doctor friend was giving me the shot tonight because my husband is working.  Luckily, I took everything over to her house, even an extra vial of PIO because I wanted to use up the last of an old vial first.

So we finally get settled in her big half bath.  Her two year old daughter is standing on the toilet because she was being sweet and just wanted to watch, so ok, whatever.  We loaded the syringe with the 18 ga which was much better than the 20 ga loading ones they gave me last time!

I pulled out the shot needle options, and my friend thought that 25 ga should be ok and hurt less.  She's given these to me before and remembered that the oil is pretty thick, but we figured we'd try it and see.  

I gasped a little as it went in.  Little girl starts crying a little but not too bad.  I hear my friend say something like ""Wow, this is going to be really slow.""  And then SNAP!  The syringe broke completely off the needle!  Progesterone went flying!  Got in my friend's face and eyes!  On little girl's face!  

I was ok.  The thin needle didn't really hurt.  It came out easily.  I took care of wiping off little girl's face with the gauze I'd been holding.  It was luckily just a tiny spot.  My friend had to wash her whole face, and she said it was lucky she had contacts in to protect her eyes.  We laughed that if she wants to try for baby #3, she'd have plenty of progesterone support now.  (Of course she's probably already knocked up cause she told me last spring they are thinking about it for the Fall, and she's a one cycle wonder.  Of course)

So we loaded up another syringe and went with the 22 ga like we should have started with.  Much better!  I gasped a little again though, and little girl cried a little again.  She was over it once she saw that I got a fun band-aid though.

Now I'm home on the couch.  Feeling the burn from the two sticks a little, but it's not bad.  One down.  Hopefully 89 to go!  Ha!

Problem solved! Right?

No, absolutely not. Here's why that is so completely wrong:



First, as a woman:

1. Hearing a lawmaker basically say that I shouldn't get access to infertility treatment and should ""just adopt,"" and that a woman with an unwanted pregnancy should ""just"" carry to term and give the baby to an infertile person like me is absolutely infuriating, because it means Mike Pence believes that NEITHER of us us should have access to healthcare and treatment that we want and need. War on women? Playing out right inside Mike Pence's tiny brain, folks.

2. Women should get to choose IF they grow their families at all, and HOW they grow their families. How our uteruses are used (or not) is something male lawmakers should really just GTFO of.



As a human being:

1. Nowhere in his argument did Mike Pence say he'd support legislation that would make it easier for women who do keep children from unplanned pregnancies, such as welfare and medical aid. Apparently, women who carry unwanted pregnancies to term should give them to wealthier families or rot in poverty.

2. One thing very few people talk about is the fact that adoption, even at birth, can cause a trauma for a child (here's an article about that: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-adopted-my-child-birth-what-do-you-mean-trauma-alex-stavros). So Mike Pence is advocating FORCING that trauma on mothers and babies with unplanned pregnancies the mother didn't want and would have ended if she'd had a choice.



And as an infertile person:

1. It's my choice how I build my family. Plain and simple. Just because I can't conceive naturally, I'm not suddenly responsible for adopting.

2. Just because I'm infertile, I'm also not suddenly responsible for adopting older children or fostering. Just because I need medical intervention, I'm not required to take a path that isn't asked of a fertile person.

3. Infertility is a range of needing a cheap pill to needing corrective surgeries and IVF. And you know what? It's often still cheaper than adoption. I think we've spent $6k on procedures this year, and that includes one round of IVF, with the drugs (with insurance, thanks to infertility coverage from my employer). My next treatment is slated to be $3k. Adoption is $30-70k and often on a sliding scale based on income. And really, even if I wanted to spend $100k on multiple IVF cycles, however delusional that may be, it's MY CHOICE how I grow my family. 
And how can you even define ""can't have children?"" Most people I know can have kids after they pursue some treatment, and most of it is cheaper than adoption (and most people I know who pursue adoption, do it after failed treatment, so nearly no one I know is adopting as Plan A).

4. **I have never, ever seen the abortion debate as, ""if only that woman who aborted could have had her baby so I could have adopted it."" Just because my arms are empty, I am not for making someone's uterus remain full when they don't want it to be, just so that I can have a child. To paint infertile people as basically willing to take a baby from anywhere, so much so that they'd be for a woman being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term is inaccurate and insulting. I don't want to be part of that pro-life narrative. Leave me out of it.**

I will NOT get pregnant on my own. 

As I am now single, my only option is to freeze my eggs. BUT...I'm going to need 2-3 cycles. And because the AMH is so low, he can't guarantee that any will be viable.

Yes, he said low quantity = low quality. Its a genetic defect thing.

On that note, he was the first to demand genetic testing. 7 fucking vials of blood. It was the first time in my life I nearly passed out from a blood draw.

The cost of freezing though is insane. I don't know how you all do it with out of pocket IVF. Over 10k just for the process and meds, not counting storage and whatever processes will be needed to get pregnant down the road.

So I have that. And it's sad and tragic because it's pretty much off the table. 

So I tell a few friends, and they said it's worth trying, and to go to other doctors and see what they think. As if they want a magical answer that I'm actually normal and fine.

What's funny is after my last visit and got a green light, I posted about it on FB and got almost 100 ""likes"" because I COULD get pregnant. My previous post about the infertility dx got maybe 3 reactions.

Is this just something that people can't wrap their head around? So many of my friends are moms, pregnant or TTC. I can see it as projected feelings, but where is the compassion, instead of aggression and insistence I keep going to more doctors as if I can find a cure?

She only said, ""I want you to have your best chance to get pregnant."" I immediately switched my case to her.

* She didn't realize until she went through my files that I'd already had 2 HSGs with slow spill. She recommended a lap, which I tentatively scheduled.  If there is anything, it'll be removed then.

* I went for a 2nd opinion at my old clinic (that I would still be with if they had embryos available right now). My doctor walked me through my HSG. My tube never dilated.

She said she'd be very surprised if something was found, but that ultimately if there was, it'd be fixed and I'd have increased odds. She said she would never have cleared me for IVF if she thought I had a hydrosalpinx, and that she thinks the tube is just injured but not in a way that would ever risk a cycle-- in her opinion, it's absolutely not a hydrosalpinx, and the fact it's not dilated when filled with fluid makes that pretty evident.

I was wondering if there is any interest (and if the mods are willing to create it) in having a single sticky thread that would be for success stories?

I feel sometimes like we never get to see the success of a take home baby. People get pregnant and move on, which I understand. 

My idea is that it would be a thread where people could post their stories, after their babies are born. I think it would be s nice touch for people to round out there journeys but also it could give us some hope. That people who jumped over the moon for infertility do great to take home babies.

I'm 34 and my husband and I have been trying to conceive since our wedding night nearly 3 years ago. After about a year we had a SA done for him with low numbers and were referred to an RE. We went for an initial consult where she made a few lifestyle change recommendations and we chose to keep trying on our own for a while, using BBT/FAM and OPK's. 

This was our choice, the RE recommended we start testing me right away, we just weren't ready and needed time to get insurance things lined up/etc. Also, I've been pregnant twice in my life (both when I was very young, both ended in very early abortions) and had an episode shortly before this where I had more than one egg erupt in a cycle, causing me some pain (or that's what the ob/gyn said after a wand sono). My BBT and OPK's all indicated things were good most of the time - the few off times I chalked up to bad testing on my part. We naively assumed the only problem was my husband's sperm count. After nearly a year of continued trying we went back to the RE. 

Initial initial tests were all promising, my HSG was clear, no signs of PCOS, hormone levels were all good, etc etc. But later initial testing showed I had a thin lining, was anovulatory, and had poop progesterone. 

Since we knew I was ovulating sometimes, the RE started me on a very low dose of clomid (half a pill) and estrace for my lining the first medicated cycle. I didn't produce large enough follicles for IUI that month so the next she bumped me up to a whole pill of clomid.

I had two promising follicles on Fri and had the best lining we've seen since we started all this, it was practically normal. I used Ovidrel on Sat and we did an IUI both Sun and Mon (cd 14 and 15). I was so nervous about the shot and not sure if I did it correctly despite having the nurse show me how twice and reading like 100 how to's online, still not sure I did it correctly but it wasn't as painful as I imagined so there's that at least. Our sperm counts pre and post wash weren't great, Sun was 8, Mon was 4, they don't really recommend them if the count is below 5 and prefer it to be above 10. She said Mon we could skip it but I was already there, it had already been washed, why not try right? I don't know if I would have gone through with it if they'd called me with the sperm count before the wash, I'm going to request this in the future if possible. We did a cervical mucus/sperm slide after the second IUI and it showed poor compatibility. I start progesterone Thurs and go in for a blood draw either Fri or Mon, then just sit back and wait til either a period or a positive is in my life in two weeks. 

While I'm not overly optimistic about this IUI being successful, I am so very relieved to finally be doing a round! I told my husband I was thinking of this round as a trial run, now I know what the drill is on IUI day and know what to expect exactly, we know drive times to the second, and I think we figured out the best way to keep his sample cup sufficiently warm during our car trip. I am unsure of what we'll do next month (already assuming it won't be a happy ending this month). My RE said we can either stay the course with clomid or move on to injectables while we see if the clomid helps my husband's sperm count OR we can just take a break for 3 months while we wait. 

Injectables sound like no fun to me; while I am totally committed to doing them if they're needed I'm feeling like if clomid is working why bother but I'm also wondering what the point of IUI is with such low sperm counts. Our RE wanted to wait til after this next blood test to make a recommendation but even then she'll just tell us stats and let us decide, which I always appreciate. Our RE says she's seen couples have success with sperm counts around 8. I'm worried about the bounce between Sun and Mon, thinking if his counts are still low next time around we'll only do one IUI for the cycle. The 8 was after 3 days of not ejaculating, we're pretty sure the 4 is because it wasn't enough time to recharge. 

Not sure what I wrote this all for, just needed to get it all down in one place I think. Thanks for listening and any advice or commiseration is certainly appreciated.

Infertility is unfair and cruel. I thought I had a handle on things. I thought I had learned to deal with the shitty empty feeling I have most days. I thought I learned to be happy and excited for my friends as they added beautiful little lives to their families. I thought being the best aunt/godmother ever was enough some days.

Everything came crashing down on me this weekend, leading me here, a fucking mess.

Last month my best friend had a baby. Since she lives in a different state, her whole pregnancy was almost daily texts of checking on her and getting updates. I guess since I didn't SEE her, this new little life was an exciting thought. I bought gifts and made a promise to visit when the baby was born, plane tickets were purchased. When she gave birth I was one of the first to know and get a picture. 

Downward spiral began. 

One night I drank too much and spent it crying on the couch while my husband (and dogs) were asleep in bed. That was the same day another friend was having a baby shower (I had RSVPd no to it very last minute). All I kept thinking about as I cried was why not me?! When will it be me? Woke up the next day with a wicked hangover and a more zen attitude about the whole thing. I brushed it off and told myself it was cathartic and to go back to the happy, positive thoughts of dealing with things.

However I spent the month until my visit in a zombie state. I sat on the couch instead of working. I dreaded getting on that plane, but I did. I met the baby. As I held the baby for the first time I fell in love while my heart completely shattered.

I should never have gone. I shouldn't have spent a week doting on and holding this little baby. I tell myself I shouldn't feel this way, but I do. 

I really thought I had moved past this almost grief-like phase of infertility. I guess it just sneaks up on you sometimes. 

In a few weeks I get to meet another friends baby. I'll try to be a little more reserved and less hands-on. Put on the smile and hide the pain.

To add total insult-to-injury, I found out my shitty ex is married and expecting a baby. Same guy who said he could never find happiness in marriage and would rather die than bring another life into this world. He's an emotionally abusive asshole and I never regret leaving him, but still. 

My WONDERFUL, loving, awesome husband deserves to be a father! 

It's unfair. All of it.

Sorry for the rant. I am a total shit show right now.

67,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey guys, I wanted to piggyback on u/LadyLatitude's post from yesterday about what to expect if you have gyn surgery (ex. oophorectomy, tubal ligation, lap fibroid surgery, exploratory laparotomy for endometriosis, etc.), but I'm creating a separate thread so that it can be easily searched for newbies/lurkers. :) I could see that this experience might be kind of traumatic if you don't know what to expect. Egg retrieval is more of a minor procedure and I will describe that below. 

When surgeons consent a patient for a procedure, they tell them about the procedure, the likely risks and benefits, and any alternative options. However, most of the time they don't often tell them the nuts and bolts of what surgery day will be like, since for them it's so routine they just sort of forget about it. For them it's not a big deal, but if you have never had surgery, you should be prepared for who all you will meet and what will happen. The most surprising thing for patients is that there will be A LOT of people involved in your surgery. 

After you check in, you will be taken to a PACU (pre/post anesthesia care unit) where you will change into a gown, get an IV, and have your vital signs taken. They may give you IV fluids and/or antibiotics. Then a bunch of people will come by to talk to you over the next hour or so to introduce themselves and get your consent. You'll see your doctor and also get consented by the anesthesiologist. A PACU nurse will be taking care of you. Once the OR room is ready and all consents have been signed, they'll wheel you back, or sometimes you might walk yourself back. You'll get on the operating table, and pretty soon thereafter they will give you some oxygen and start giving you drugs to make you go to sleep. Your physician will be there too, making sure everything goes OK with anesthesia before they start. They might put compression stockings or boots on you to help prevent blood clots. There will be other people milling about doing their jobs. After you go to sleep, they will put your legs in these heavy duty moveable stirrup things that look like boots, but they don't generally do this while the patient is awake. Yes, several of these people will see you naked but to be honest with you, doctors and nurses are generally pretty interested in patient privacy and will keep you covered up as much as possible. They also cover you with a drape for sterility purposes. Here is what the staff would be for a typical laparoscopic gynecology procedure: 

Attending surgeon- your main doctor. They will be the director of the the team and do the main part of the surgery. 

First assist- another doctor who will be assisting in the surgery. 
Laparoscopic surgery requires 4 hands so there MUST be an assistant to help hold things, move things out of the way, etc. If you're at an academic practice, this will most likely be the fellow, but could be a resident, or at a private practice may be another doctor or advanced practice nurse or physician assistant. 

Another doctor will be required to stabilize the cervix from below for most surgeries. They are basically just a pair of hands. 

Anesthesiologist - doctor in charge of anesthesia and the rest of your general health (vital signs, etc). Many places might also have a nurse anesthetist involved. 

Scrub tech - person who hands the doctor the instruments. 

OR nurse - helps keep the patient safe, gives meds, etc. 

Runner - person who fetches things from cabinets or from other rooms, answers pages as necessary, phones, etc. 

If you're at an academic practice, there might also be a med student or resident involved in your case. They might just watch, or they might help out by holding instruments or something. It is perfectly OK to politely ask your doctor or anyone you meet what their role in your case is going to be. There might also be another runner or nurse helping out, and it's possible that the anesthesia team could have a med student or resident with them too. 

When you wake up, you will be back in the PACU and your nurse will be there to take care of you. Ask them for pain or nausea meds if you need it. In general, they want you to pee on your own before they let you leave as well as eat a little something, and also make sure you are feeling decent before you go b/c you don't want to be in terrible pain or nausea b/c that won't lead to anything good. Your doctor may or may not swing by to see you before you go. 

For a ""minor procedure"" like egg retrieval, this is generally done in an outpatient surgical center, and the people involved will be your doctor, an assistant doctor b/c they need someone to hold things, an anesthesiologist, a nurse, and a tech. Still a lot of people, but less so than for a more major procedure. 

I hope this helps people get an idea of what it's like to have surgery, b/c it's not like on TV where it's just the patient, one doctor, and maybe a nurse. Surgery requires a whole production team to keep the patient safe, and everyone has an important job. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you think we should edit this post to be more helpful. :)

<p>If you&#39;re at an academic practice, there might also be a med student or resident involved in your case. They might just watch, or they might help out by holding instruments or something. It is perfectly OK to politely ask your doctor or anyone you meet what their role in your case is going to be. There might also be another runner or nurse helping out, and it&#39;s possible that the anesthesia team could have a med student or resident with them too. </p>

<p>When you wake up, you will be back in the PACU and your nurse will be there to take care of you. Ask them for pain or nausea meds if you need it. In general, they want you to pee on your own before they let you leave as well as eat a little something, and also make sure you are feeling decent before you go b/c you don&#39;t want to be in terrible pain or nausea b/c that won&#39;t lead to anything good. Your doctor may or may not swing by to see you before you go. </p>

<p>For a &quot;minor procedure&quot; like egg retrieval, this is generally done in an outpatient surgical center, and the people involved will be your doctor, an assistant doctor b/c they need someone to hold things, an anesthesiologist, a nurse, and a tech. Still a lot of people, but less so than for a more major procedure. </p>

<p>I hope this helps people get an idea of what it&#39;s like to have surgery, b/c it&#39;s not like on TV where it&#39;s just the patient, one doctor, and maybe a nurse. Surgery requires a whole production team to keep the patient safe, and everyone has an important job. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you think we should edit this post to be more helpful. :)</p>

I've been really quiet since my 6th miscarriage that happened in July but now that I'm officially going through my 1st IUI cycle, I guess I'm mentally ready for whatever is going to happen!
I'm presently day 8 on my IUI cycle, so I finished taking my Femara last night and I'm waiting for my ultrasound on day 12 to see if it's a go for the insemination on day 14. Right now, I feel like I have fucked the whole thing completely! 


Let me explain: I began my Femara one day before flying to meet my friend and the rest of her bridal party to shop the whole weekend for her wedding dress so it was definitely a busy and emotional weekend. I was a bit anxious to start this treatment while being away from home but I thought: ""I'm not going to stop living my life for this! I'll take it and still fly out to see my friends!""
So I went. When I got the ""OK"" to start my Femara by my RE, I told her that I had lots of migraines while doing a Clomid treatment so I was wondering if I could take one of my typical migraine medication (Zomig, or Naproxen or Tylenol with codeine) if it happened this time, but unfortunately, she didn't recommended any of them and told me to just take Tylenol! (For a migraine sufferer, Tylenol is pretty much the equivalent of candies). Unfortunately I got one on Saturday.  Since I wasn't home and felt like my left side of my head was going to explode, I had to take something or I'm pretty sure I would have needed to go to the hospital. I feel horrible that I have possibly screwed up my whole IUI but it was so intolerable that I took a chance and I hope this won't affect too much. So this was my first ""shit, I've possibly screwed my cycle"". 

I got back at 1am this morning from my trip and woke up and had sex with my husband, but then, we realized that I was at my day 8 and on my IUI calendar, it was noted: ""No sexual intercourse after day 7 until IUI"". I had completely forgot about that. Argh.

Just wanting to introduce myself and say, ""sucks to be here."" I'm hoping this place is full of so much awesomeness that it really makes being here that much easier. 

I'm pretty new to all of this but to sum it up I've spent the last 17 months over on the ""Trying to Conceive"" boards and today I started my first round of Clomid. 

I'll be 32 on October 18th (two days before what should have been my due date...a date I'm REALLY excited to get beyond) and my husband and I started trying to get knocked up in May 2015. I know it is naive and something that the majority of us have all said before, but I honestly had no clue getting pregnant would be this hard. The entirety of my family fall into one of two camps :

* 1) The cousin/sister/aunt who gets pregnant simply by having drunken first date sex with a random they met at a bar which subsequently results in pregnancy.
* 2) The cousin/sister/aunt who plans their pregnancy, stops their birth control pill, and within one cycle falls pregnant and exclaims, ""Wow! That was easy!!""

And then there is me - the person who stopped asking relatives a long time ago how long it took them to get pregnant. My sister is 43 and has two teenagers...a couple of weeks ago she actually sent me a magazine article that discussed how planning the days you have sex can actually help you in getting pregnant!!! Who knew?! I texted her when I got it and said, ""That explains it! We'd been doing it in the butt this whole time!!!""

She didn't laugh the same way I did. Or roll her eyes, I'm sure. I just wanted to punch her! I mean, we've been trying this long to get pregnant and the thought that we skipped over something as basic as, ""when to have sex"" seriously entered her brain.

Anyways, I did get pregnant back in February but at 10 weeks I had a Missed Miscarriage (I hate that -- ""missed"". Like, what did it miss? What did I miss?) and then had a D&C the following day. I met with my OB the other week and she thought it'd be a good idea to start trying to nudge our way into the right direction because our odds are real shit right now. So, today is Cycle Day 3 and I'm on Clomid today until the 7th. Then I switch over to Estradiol from the 8th-12th and have an Ultrasound on the 12th. I'll then jump onto the Progesterone Suppository (heh heh - jump onto) on the 17th. 

Thus far, my Clomid side effect is this weird ""rash"" on my stomach. It isn't a rash though - it almost looks like writing - a giant ""W"" to be precise. I've always had such fair skin that as a child I could use my finger nail to ""write"" on my arms. Within a few seconds of doing so the letters would start to appear in red on my skin. It is looking like that on my stomach. No itch, no raised little bumps -- just strange marks. My husband said it looked like something was trying to write from the inside of me. Which is just enough funny and creepy to make me feel better about the whole thing.

Like I said, I just hope y'all kick so much ass that being here isn't as shitty as it feels right now.

87,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Fellow Barren Bitches, I need a break from this sub. 

I feel like I'm changing. I feel like I don't quite fit in here anymore. I'm a veteran here, (or so I feel I am with all of the new usernames) and I just don't feel the way I used to about my infertility. This is a wonderful space for those who need support,. I believe I've contributed a lot here; I've opened my soul here, but I'm just not up for that anymore. 

Infertility has been one shit-filled bag of a journey after another. Currently, my husband is waiting on security clearances for his new job that offers IF coverage. We will do one more IVF cycle as soon as we can. If it fails, I strongly feel that we'll be done, maybe we'll do a third, it depends. I know I've said it before, but I'm running out of gas quickly (and eggs, DOR is fun y'all). 

More and more my husband and I talk about our life childfree, starting a business, living abroad for a few years, retiring early, living on a boat, or in a tiny condo, etc. Especially now, he's about to start a job where he will travel Mon-Thurs. Also, we planned for me to stay home with the baby, but now that we live in California ($$$) we can't afford that. I'm sure we could figure it all out if we got lucky, but for now, our life no longer seems to lean towards the traditional nuclear family anymore. When we think about this upcoming IVF cycle, we agree we're not doing it because we think or even hope it will work, but so that we can always know we gave it our very, very, very best try. Adulting is hard; it's especially heartbreaking when you learn dreams don't always come true. 

But my infertility will not ruin my life. I no longer wish to prioritize treatment in my life. There, I said it. (I feel better).

One last thing, I've mentioned this vaguely a few times, but I was sexually abused by my older brother when I was a pre-teen and early teen. I was adopted, and he was my parents oldest (biological) son. He was 16 years older than me. My parents were emotionally abusive to all of their children, and so he was never encouraged to leave the nest. He never moved out, and I couldn't escape him. Many times I would wake up naked feeling groggy. I know he drugged me. I don't think he ever raped me, but I'll never know for sure. He died of a drug over-dose (irony?) when I was in high school, so what is there to be done now? Not much. 

It's so hard to fight the anger that wells up inside of me because I know this experience I had, these issues I thought I had dealt with, are affecting my ability to continue treatment. For example, I was *HORRIFIED* to learn everything that was done to my unconscious body during my lap. Do you know they scrub your vagina and leave you to air dry? They shave you and my RE *let his intern perform a pelvic on me with a speculum* when I was drugged and unable to say fuck no. They insert devices into your uterus through your vagina, and there are half a dozen people in the room. I was so angry that I was only told about the camera in the navel and the two tiny incisions on your lower abdomen. I was lied to and dismissed. You all likely were. I know what you're thinking, I should have told my RE about the abuse. But no, I shouldn't have to wear a label of abuse for my fucking doctor to respect my body conscious or unconscious. Then again, at my egg retrieval, I knew exactly what would happen, and I was so nervous. I was shaking and crying and my (pregnant) anesthesiologist literally asked me ""what's my problem"". Over sedation is common in American medical practice, and I'm sick of it. But, I suppose this is really another topic of conversation. The thing is, all of this may not be a big deal to you, and I envy you that, but it's huge to me. Huge. But the abuse affected me even before IF treatment when we were still doing timed intercourse. 

It's time for me to stop ignoring these feelings. I need to take back my body and my life. I need to move forward. This sub is full of so many people I've grown to care so much about. But, it represents a certain place in my life, a place I'm thinking about leaving. 

Infertility will always be a thing. Sad, but true. So, this sub will always have a revolving population (be nice to the newbies, newbies, read the rules). We come, we cry, we get poked and prodded, we give all of our dollars, we get our baby or we don't and we move on. Everyone's journey is different, and everyone's stay varies in length. I know I'm not ""graduating"" in the sense we talk about here, but maybe we should also call those who choose to stop infertility treatments as graduates as well?

I'm not going to disappear though. I'll check in on my girls (and guys!). Once our IVF get's put on a calendar, I'll be more active, I'm sure. I'm a new mod over at r/CFCrafting, so check me out there. Also, if you live in SoCal, I *am* still planning a meet-up (send me your email!) because I need friends in my new city.

Thank you to everyone who was here for me when I needed it. Thank you for holding my hand and giving me support. I hope that I offered as much support in return. I wish so much for all of your dreams to come true, but because we don't always get what we dream of, I also wish you lasting peace and happiness. What we give each other here can never be repaid. I love you all so much. <3

**UPDATE:** You guys have brought me to tears with your love and warmth!!! I just cannot thank everyone here enough for this endless support and love. This break, while definitely needed, is so bittersweet because y'all are absolutely amazingly wonderful and beautiful people, inside out. I will miss this sisterhood. Thank you, thank you so much!!!!! <3",t2_kl9je,False,,0,False,"Taking a break, talk of abuse & CF life.

<p>I feel like I&#39;m changing. I feel like I don&#39;t quite fit in here anymore. I&#39;m a veteran here, (or so I feel I am with all of the new usernames) and I just don&#39;t feel the way I used to about my infertility. This is a wonderful space for those who need support,. I believe I&#39;ve contributed a lot here; I&#39;ve opened my soul here, but I&#39;m just not up for that anymore. </p>

<p>Infertility has been one shit-filled bag of a journey after another. Currently, my husband is waiting on security clearances for his new job that offers IF coverage. We will do one more IVF cycle as soon as we can. If it fails, I strongly feel that we&#39;ll be done, maybe we&#39;ll do a third, it depends. I know I&#39;ve said it before, but I&#39;m running out of gas quickly (and eggs, DOR is fun y&#39;all). </p>

<p>More and more my husband and I talk about our life childfree, starting a business, living abroad for a few years, retiring early, living on a boat, or in a tiny condo, etc. Especially now, he&#39;s about to start a job where he will travel Mon-Thurs. Also, we planned for me to stay home with the baby, but now that we live in California ($$$) we can&#39;t afford that. I&#39;m sure we could figure it all out if we got lucky, but for now, our life no longer seems to lean towards the traditional nuclear family anymore. When we think about this upcoming IVF cycle, we agree we&#39;re not doing it because we think or even hope it will work, but so that we can always know we gave it our very, very, very best try. Adulting is hard; it&#39;s especially heartbreaking when you learn dreams don&#39;t always come true. </p>

<p>But my infertility will not ruin my life. I no longer wish to prioritize treatment in my life. There, I said it. (I feel better).</p>

<p>One last thing, I&#39;ve mentioned this vaguely a few times, but I was sexually abused by my older brother when I was a pre-teen and early teen. I was adopted, and he was my parents oldest (biological) son. He was 16 years older than me. My parents were emotionally abusive to all of their children, and so he was never encouraged to leave the nest. He never moved out, and I couldn&#39;t escape him. Many times I would wake up naked feeling groggy. I know he drugged me. I don&#39;t think he ever raped me, but I&#39;ll never know for sure. He died of a drug over-dose (irony?) when I was in high school, so what is there to be done now? Not much. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so hard to fight the anger that wells up inside of me because I know this experience I had, these issues I thought I had dealt with, are affecting my ability to continue treatment. For example, I was <em>HORRIFIED</em> to learn everything that was done to my unconscious body during my lap. Do you know they scrub your vagina and leave you to air dry? They shave you and my RE <em>let his intern perform a pelvic on me with a speculum</em> when I was drugged and unable to say fuck no. They insert devices into your uterus through your vagina, and there are half a dozen people in the room. I was so angry that I was only told about the camera in the navel and the two tiny incisions on your lower abdomen. I was lied to and dismissed. You all likely were. I know what you&#39;re thinking, I should have told my RE about the abuse. But no, I shouldn&#39;t have to wear a label of abuse for my fucking doctor to respect my body conscious or unconscious. Then again, at my egg retrieval, I knew exactly what would happen, and I was so nervous. I was shaking and crying and my (pregnant) anesthesiologist literally asked me &quot;what&#39;s my problem&quot;. Over sedation is common in American medical practice, and I&#39;m sick of it. But, I suppose this is really another topic of conversation. The thing is, all of this may not be a big deal to you, and I envy you that, but it&#39;s huge to me. Huge. But the abuse affected me even before IF treatment when we were still doing timed intercourse. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time for me to stop ignoring these feelings. I need to take back my body and my life. I need to move forward. This sub is full of so many people I&#39;ve grown to care so much about. But, it represents a certain place in my life, a place I&#39;m thinking about leaving. </p>

When my husband and I began the IVF journey in May, I didn't realize how much it would consume my life. I love fall. I love orange, pumpkins, acorns, the smell of soggy leaves in misty foggy mornings. I wait in anticipation generally in August for the autumn months to greet me. But, this year, IVF consumed my summer. My sweetheart and I have been trying to have children for over five, long, grueling, exhausting years. We've tried it all, clomid, IUIs, diets, etc. By far, of all the time spent waiting,  this summer, has been the longest. We had our first appointment in May and discovered after an ultrasound that I needed an MRI to rule out cancer on an ovary. Thank goodness, no cancer. But, I had to have surgery to remove two lumps in my uterus. I have been diagnosed with endometriosis. So, after all those invasive procedures, we got the all clear from our expert medical team that we could begin IVF. So sure were the doctors on our team that we would become pregnant that I let myself get hopeful and excited all over again. I was elated, happy, even though I was completely consumed by shots, ultrasounds, blood draws, exhaustion, and hormonal crazy nonsense. Sadly, the cycle was cancelled after the egg retrieval because my eggs and my sweatheart's sperm don't communicate. That's correct, after over ten years of marriage, countless romps in many locations, our cells don't know what to do. His sperm on one side of the dish, my eggs on the other. After rescue ICSI, none of our embryos made it to the blastocyst stage. Round 2 IVF began shortly after, harvested several eggs which quite a few made it to blastocyst with a B+ to A+ rating. However, after the long, long, long, arduous two week wait, I received the cold cold call from the RN that my beta result was negative. Numb, I hung up the phone, shaking and scared. I took a breath. Only one tear fell. I had no words for the vast majority of the rest of my day. Only when my husband took me out for a milkshake did I realize fall was here. I looked out the window and the first words I spoke after the phone call were ""Oh my god...the leaves are changing color"". 

In the midst of our battle, we have had little to no support from family or friends. We have lost many of our closest friends due to their incredible fertility. (someone on another post called it the land of unicorns and rainbows...i was thankful for this and seriously laughed out loud). They, often cruelly, tell us we ""don't get it"" or ""don't understand"" or even worse things that I can't recall at the present moment. Certain family members have been incredibly crude, cold, treat us like we are ignorant, and demand great expectations in terms of our contributions to other siblings fortunes when it comes to their families. 

Its odd, isn't it? Finding ourselves in a world we never imagined. Lonely, disheartened, isolated, fearful, sad. Life goes on for the rest of the world, but for us, we are here...still here in the same place. Our care team is confident the technology we work for us eventually, so, in a week or two, we will be attempting a FET cycle. Bewildered, I came to reddit simply to share my story with friends I knew would understand the depths to which this journey takes us all. I am frightened and could use some encouragement from folks who, like me, understand how the changing of seasons can go unnoticed, how days can turn into weeks, and weeks can turn into months, and suddenly, its been several years.

I was just thinking how lucky I was to make it to the end of my infertility journey without experiencing a close friend getting pregnant. Our FET is this week and we'll know whether or not we're pregnant in just two short weeks. 

If positive: Hallelujah! Let's spend the next day, week, month, months freaking out over every little thing hoping that it lasts. 

If negative: We take a long break, continue living life, and figure out our next steps. But, we live normally knowing we won't be doing IVF ever again. Donor Eggs or Adoption will be something we'll look into in the far future.

I've been so excited about getting to the end of this journey. I'm so ready for it to be over. And I'm so ready to just know if we'll be childless or if we'll be parents. 

I currently have 5 friends trying to get pregnant. They all started trying in Spring/Summer. My one request to them all (only because the timeline works out) was to just wait until my IVF treatment was over. I knew that if any of them succeeded, they would be about 12 weeks along when we were finished. So, I just asked that they don't tell me until we've reached the end. 

And then, it happened. Today I found out that one of my closest friends is 11 weeks. Her wedding was in April. I was in the midst of the 2 week wait for my final IUI before moving onto IVF and I was 5 days late. I spent the entire wedding weekend trying to focus on being a good bridesmaid but also being careful, just in case I was pregnant. I ran to the bathroom to check for a period every hour. I stayed sober. I did a lot of sitting so that I didn't wear myself out. As soon as I got home from the wedding weekend, I started. The IUI had officially failed. And now she's pregnant. Before me. She's the one planning a gender reveal, preparing a nursery, and thinking of possible names. She got pregnant 3 months after getting married. And I'm still trying to hold on to every ounce of hope I have left.

I'm sorting through my feelings. I'm jealous. So extremely jealous. I'm also happy for them. She has always talked about how we'd all be mommies together and dreamed of the days when she'd have her own child. She's so lucky that she didn't have any problems getting pregnant. And it makes my stomach turn. I want to barf. 

Honestly, I just wish it could have waited 2 weeks. Maybe that's selfish but, fuck. I get to be selfish and whiny because infertility fucking sucks. I'm so close to being finished. I've been taking such good care of myself in preparation for this FET. I'm having an amazing weekend treating myself to all things that make me happy. Then this news just comes along and punches me right in the gut. Apparently, it couldn't wait just two weeks because she's ready to announce on Facebook and is trying to plan her gender reveal for October.   

My husband is the one who told me, thanks to the most amazing best friend in the world. The pregnant friend called this friend (Courtney) to tell her the news first. Courtney has been my rock through this whole ordeal. She tried to talk preggo friend into waiting 2 weeks to announce, but couldn't. So, Courtney called my husband, crying out of hurt and concern for me, to let him know what was going on. She wanted him to tell me so that it wasn't a shock and I'd have time to process. Courtney is beyond amazing for thinking of this idea. I'd much rather have my husband tell me at home than to be blindsided when preggo calls to tell me. She's supposed to text tomorrow with the news. I wonder how she'll word it? Thank goodness I'm prepared!

Right now, I'm thankful for awesome friends like Courtney who know exactly what to do. I'm thankful for an amazing husband who allowed me to vent my anger and loved on me when I needed it. And, I'm thankful that my friend didn't have to experience infertility. But, I'm also hurting. 

My first PIO injection was tonight. It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought. Mr. Merman set me up with a heating pad and blanket on the couch afterwards and declared that he'd make a great doctor. :) 

I've been feeling at peace about this upcoming FET. And now I've got this pregnancy announcement looming over my head, taking over my thoughts. How much harder will it be if this fails and I have to continue going through each milestone of her pregnancy? I just wish she could have waited 2 more weeks.

I&#39;m already feeling nervous enough that the test is going to be negative--2+ years of trying both naturally and with meds and TI breeds a lot of apathy and disappointment in negative tests--but it would definitely help emotionally to KNOW either way.  </p>

So I took a bit of a break, it's been a really hard few weeks. 
For fear of boring everyone I'll try and keep it super short. 

So transfer of 2 high quality embryos on August 22nd.Positive HPT on 11dpt, we were beyond excited. it had been a VERY long road to even get to transfer. For those that aren't familiar, my egg retrieval was in Nov 2015, and I suffered sever OHSS. Obviously fresh transfer cancelled. 4 transfers cancelled after that for uterine issues. Had an ERA in June that said I did it deed have a receptive uterus! yay!!

After the HPT our hcgs started out a little low, but we were assured as long as they doubled don't worry. the second a little less then doubled after 48hrs, so I insisted on a 3rd.... 4 days later didn't even come close to doubling. Told pregnancy likely not viable. We played the hcg game for another week and a half before they gave me the go ahead to stop meds. the hcgs continued to very slowly rise. 

Skip through to 1.5 weeks later, it's been confirmed I'm not ectopic, I've had some bleeding but fairy light, and hcgs continue to slowly rise. First medical intervention failed, and I'm still waiting for things to happen. I'm trying a couple other things this weekend, but if it doesn't resolve I will have a D&C on Monday. ( sorry I'm trying to be sensitive, not sure how much I can say, while still being sensitive).

We are devestated yet so numb at the same time. We just want it to be over. It seems cruel that it's dragging out like this. However I've been so thankful for the OB I found to deal with this part, as my RE doesn't follow through with this stuff. 

Looks like it'll be December before we can try again, and that's IF things go as they should. Meanwhile I'm freaked out about the quality of our leftover embryos since this is what happened after transferring 2 of high quality. Definitely have some questions to ask the RE.

I finally made an account the other day to reply to the question regarding IVF abroad and thought I'd introduce myself/share my story. I've been lurking for a while but would love to become part of this community if you'll have me! My husband and I have been trying for about two years and have experienced four losses. This first was at 14 weeks (triploidy), followed by two 5-week miscarriages, then most recently a missed miscarriage found at 12-weeks during the NT scan (trisomy 13). We were both 33 when we started, now 35. So while we're not 'young' we have definitely been shocked by all this. After this last loss we decided that IVF with PGS would be our next step, as I don't trust my body's eggs or ability to sort out viable pregnancies.

And this leads me to the Czech Republic! After getting a RIDICULOUS quote from our very-well-regarded local clinic I got crazy with research and that led me to Brno. From reading through posts it seems like a few of you are also considering this for donor eggs- so I thought it might help to tell my story. I spent three weeks in Brno (with ReproGenesis) and came out with 10 eggs, 2-pgs tested blastocysts currently frozen. I'll go back in a few weeks to transfer one embryo. Because of my history and AMH (1.15), we were thinking this was out last effort with OE and then move on to  Czech donor eggs, depending on what happened. Obviously we can't say if we were successful yet...but I can say that if this cycle doesn't work we would feel confident going back to try again! And I would absolutely recommend the DE option. 

So here's the info/advice I would give to someone considering IVF in CZ:


-In the US we are used to a lot of hand-holding, receiving every bit of info...don't expect to to be given the same amount of info as you would here
-the twandings are a bit different. If you are used to going to a dimly lit room and laying down, that may not be the case in CZ. I sat on this weird chair with stirrups in a BRIGHT room. My knee was basically in the doctors arm pit. It was awkward.
-not as strict; they told me limited coffee and alcohol are OK (during stims) and they don't do bedrest after FETs
-they stim you a lot less aggressively, aim for 10-15 eggs.
-less monitoring

Overall, I feel like if I would've cycled here I might've felt a lot of anxiety and pressure given our history and amount of money spent. At least by going over there I felt like I was at least getting a vacation-type experience! Being pumped full of hormones isn't the ideal way to spend a vacation, but if this cycle is unsuccessful, at least we saw a different part of the world and have some interesting memories. We went to Prague and Vienna also- it wasn't hard to navigate or find our way around. I have a ton more info and can get real specific but this is already getting long- so please ask me anything or feel free to message me!!

PS- I have to say I am SO GLAD to have found a community where all the shitty-glitter-cutesy acronyms are forbidden.

We were expecting to spend upwards of $3500 to have those two embryos tested, then our doctor at MGH told us they've started using a new vendor based out of Cambridge, MA called Good Start Genetics. They price their testing on a per embryo basis and it's super reasonable. 

I figured I'd share in case anyone wants to get PGS testing done but is afraid of the cost. For 1-2 embryos it was $350 plus a $150 flat fee for overnight shipping a frozen biopsy sample. For 3-4 embryos it was $700 plus the $150 shipping. I think it maxed out at $1500 and that was for (I think) 11+ embryos tested. If you want the actual pricing sheet they gave me, send a PM and I'll take a picture of it when I'm home because it's not on their website.

They are a newer vendor for PGS testing, but my doctor said they've been very pleased with their testing methods and results. Hope this helps someone out there!

The psy eval fuck-ups : we finally meet the senior psy of the clinic last sunday. She was very nice (and she was sorry for all the mess, which was not her fault). So... all was suppose to be well, right?

Left a message on tuesday, to check that the Coordination had the report, and all was well. 

Had to go to the office yesterday, and when came back, there was two messages from the clinic. First one : yes, all is well. Second one : hum, well, sorry about that, there are some blood test results that have not been signed, so call us back in a week to check.

.... I knew what bloody tests, we discuss them with the RE (the glucose thingy and general hormones).... Left a message, saying the doc had saw them....

Anyways.... got a call today, saying that the RE say the results and she wants me to go a repeat control of prolactin, as it was a bit high, and the TSH, to be sure. And that we are bench until we have the results. 

And of course, I had my day 1 today. I ask why the feck did no one did the follow up on that, as we say the RE on September 15, and there was all the fuck-up with the psy?

Anyways..... went to a private clinic to get the blood test, clinic should get the results in 24 to 48 hrs, so... if results are normal, we might be able to have a IUI in october (cycle was 32 day for some reason, but as i'm around 30 days, could start femara on day 5).

And i guess, if results are abnormal, good things it is being check before (donor sperm is expensive).

But FFS. So, so tired of all the fuck-ups. 2 years of waiting by the phone and multiple fucks-up is........ a long time.

I had my WTF with my RE today, and we're doing one more Clomid IUI, and then he's moving me to injectibles for the next cycle if this one doesn't work.  Next cycle will still be IUI, just with injectibles (are these the ""stims"" of which y'all speak?).

He said I should go ahead and order in the next week or so, in order for them to be here on time.

He gave me my choice on this.  I can go HMG intramuscular (cheapest option), Menopur, Gonal F, or Follistim (more expensive).  He said any of these would be fine for our purposes.

He gave me an order form for ivfmeds.com and they're charging $18/vial for generic HMG, and he said I'll need 30-35 of them.

I'm just checking to see if any of y'all have a better hookup.  He said sometimes ordering from overseas can be better, and he's happy to fax the script/order anywhere I choose.  I just want to make sure I don't get shafted.  (I'm secretly hoping I get pregnant this cycle and have the ""problem"" of paid-for, unneeded medications.)

Also; I posted this on /offmychest

Just need to get this off my chest. My boyfriend and I have been trying to conceive a child for two years now, having sex almost every single day at least once. We started trying for a baby when I was 19, and he was 23. Yes I realize this is usually considered very young but we are financially able to raise a child, we're in love, our relationship is healthy and I've always wanted to bring children into this world early. Well, two years later and still no baby. I'd go see a fertility doctor but because our situation is so unconventional compared to the usual social standards I know a doctor will not take my infertility seriously. Being only 21 and unmarried leaves me worried that I'll have to wait a couple more years to get medical advice/help to conceive. On top of that stress, my very conservative mother is constantly telling me I look or am acting pregnant, pestering me about when I had my period last, and advising me to get back on some birth control to be precautionary and avoid an ""unwanted child"". I always tell her we use condoms and that under no circumstances am I pregnant. Little does she know I've been trying to get pregnant for years.... Little does she know how much it hurts me when she says I've gained a little pooch, and she's SOOO concerned I'm pregnant. She's even bought me pregnancy tests and left them at my doorstep because she was THAT concerned, demanded I take them and let her know the results so she can ""relieve her stress"". 

I know that compared to many couples fertility struggles and problems this is hardly the tip of the iceberg compared to how my situation could be... But I still feel so sad about it.

<p>Also; I posted this on /offmychest</p>

<p>Just need to get this off my chest. My boyfriend and I have been trying to conceive a child for two years now, having sex almost every single day at least once. We started trying for a baby when I was 19, and he was 23. Yes I realize this is usually considered very young but we are financially able to raise a child, we&#39;re in love, our relationship is healthy and I&#39;ve always wanted to bring children into this world early. Well, two years later and still no baby. I&#39;d go see a fertility doctor but because our situation is so unconventional compared to the usual social standards I know a doctor will not take my infertility seriously. Being only 21 and unmarried leaves me worried that I&#39;ll have to wait a couple more years to get medical advice/help to conceive. On top of that stress, my very conservative mother is constantly telling me I look or am acting pregnant, pestering me about when I had my period last, and advising me to get back on some birth control to be precautionary and avoid an &quot;unwanted child&quot;. I always tell her we use condoms and that under no circumstances am I pregnant. Little does she know I&#39;ve been trying to get pregnant for years.... Little does she know how much it hurts me when she says I&#39;ve gained a little pooch, and she&#39;s SOOO concerned I&#39;m pregnant. She&#39;s even bought me pregnancy tests and left them at my doorstep because she was THAT concerned, demanded I take them and let her know the results so she can &quot;relieve her stress&quot;. </p>

<p>I know that compared to many couples fertility struggles and problems this is hardly the tip of the iceberg compared to how my situation could be... But I still feel so sad about it.</p>

I’m a bit disappointed with 3 but also recognize that this is still good and I’m so grateful for that.

My cd3 monitoring appt (for IVF/ICSI) was Wednesday. When I got there, there was another patient there with her son. He was probably a year old or so, only word he knew was mommy and he was in a stroller. The tech did my u/s while another one did the other patients bloodwork in another room. The tech finished with me first so I went back to the waiting room to wait my turn for bloodwork. They finish with the other patient and she brings the stroller back out to the waiting room.

So they do my blood and As I'm walking up the hallway back to the waiting room I can hear this kid wailing for mommy. The receptionists chair is behind a corner so she couldn't see me coming but she could hear me and she goes ""here she comes"" to the kid and he's staring at me and I just said ""nope"" And the receptionist starts laughing and goes ""wrong mommy!""

Sorry in advance for the novel. My husband and I just had our follow-up appt with our RE (we've been trying for 2 years but a total of about 12 cycles). We went over all of our testing we've had the last few months. Here are the results:

HSG/SIS - all clear, AFC - 8+10 or 18 total follicles, AMH - 11.2 (he joked ""you didn't tell me you were actually 19"" or something along those lines. he said over 3 is good ovarian reserve). I didn't ask specifically about FSH or the other hormones from CD3 bloodwork I had done. Assuming all is good. TSH/thyroid - under control at 0.52.

Semen Analysis has been variable and is a bit unpredictable. Most recently:

Total count - 48.8 million (20.1 million in Aug, 68 million in April)

Progressive motility - 19% (9% in April)

Total motility - 26% (18% in April)

Morphology - 3%

Sperm antibodies are POSITIVE (ugh)... I need to read up on this because I don't know enough. Please feel free to share experiences. My husband has now been taking CoQ10, l-carnitine, zinc, selenium, and vit c since our initial consult appt in July. Scrotal ultrasound is negative for varicocele and he doesn't feel it's necessary to see a Urologist right now even with the antibodies.

Our RE is happy enough with the numbers to try IUI. We discussed clomid vs. femara. It's a bit of a blur but I think he said for women who have low ovarian reserve, femara is better. His drug of choice would be clomid for me. BUT he also said that with our sperm the way it is, his first choice (if it were free) would be IVF because your chances of success are so much higher. However, it is a lot more invasive. He figures that IUI is worth a shot though with approx. 8 million motile sperm. His bottom line is 3 million and he won't usually do IUI less than that.

I told him I was slightly concerned about the bad things I've read about clomid (mostly the emotional side effects). He said that injectables have less side effects that way, and although they are more expensive, it's a more controlled cycle. He said that if I'm not too concerned about the impact on my work life (monitoring appointments every 2 days, etc), that injectables was a good option for us. He seemed to prefer the injectables IUI route. 

He quoted us about a 10% chance with clomid IUI and a 20% chance with injectables IUI. 

I just wanted to get some experienced opinions on this plan. Do you see any red flags? Any comments? Any suggestions or advice? Will also cross-post to r/infertilitybabies as well. Thanks in advance.

His drug of choice would be clomid for me. BUT he also said that with our sperm the way it is, his first choice (if it were free) would be IVF because your chances of success are so much higher. However, it is a lot more invasive. He figures that IUI is worth a shot though with approx. 8 million motile sperm. His bottom line is 3 million and he won&#39;t usually do IUI less than that.</p>

<p>I told him I was slightly concerned about the bad things I&#39;ve read about clomid (mostly the emotional side effects). He said that injectables have less side effects that way, and although they are more expensive, it&#39;s a more controlled cycle. He said that if I&#39;m not too concerned about the impact on my work life (monitoring appointments every 2 days, etc), that injectables was a good option for us. He seemed to prefer the injectables IUI route. </p>

<p>He quoted us about a 10% chance with clomid IUI and a 20% chance with injectables IUI. </p>

<p>I just wanted to get some experienced opinions on this plan. Do you see any red flags? Any comments? Any suggestions or advice? Will also cross-post to <a href=""/r/infertilitybabies"">r/infertilitybabies</a> as well. Thanks in advance.</p>

Period has begun about 5 days before expected so Yesterday was my CD1 and I call the RE and got a startup appointment today at 10 am.

So going through all the questionnaires that needs done on the startup date. She then ask ""Do you have hairgrowth up to your bellybutton?"". My mind just froze because I know what she is angling for and I have had this discussion with multiple doctors who all gave me the conclusion that I did not have PCOS. husband ended up answering that I had a lot and all the other typical PCO places, face, chin ect.

Doctor: ""oh well then you have PCOS without being annovulatory""

Me: ""No I have had this tested since I was 17. I have always been told that I did not have PCOS. I have pressed this issue many times due to my symptoms and the simmilarities to PCOS""

Doctor: ""It is a grey area and they keep redefining the boundaries but I have seen many like you and you do have PCOS. They have all been tested and never diagnosed""

Me: ""So I'm a borderline case?""(the exact thing I have been trying to tell my normal doctors for 6 years)

Doctor: ""Yes. You have many eggs and are ovulating so we need to be careful not to overstimmulate your ovaries.""


Background story from when I was 17 til now:

Having excessive hair-growth and being overweight was the reason I was tested at 17, but everything came back negative even though I had a doctor who was adamant that I had PCO. She actually sounded disappointed when the scan for cysts came back negative, and then when my bloodtest was negative as well. Then she  did a sugar absorption test which I passed with flying colours.

She used to say ""You may not have it now but you will get it!"" (""Mark my words!"" was unspoken).

This statement has haunted me since and is the reason I have kept coming back to the doctors to get checked for PCO(especially when my weight increased). 

in 2011 I was tested because I had read that you just had to fit 2 out of 5 criterias(which I did) but the doctor just did the bloodtest and said ""you do not have PCO"" so I pressed about diet and help loosing weight because surely there was something not working when I ate healthy and didn't loose weight. He asked me if I was trying to get pregnant which the answer at that point was no. ""Well until you are trying to get pregnant there is no reason to mess with a complicated diet like KISS or to send you to a PCOS expert. You are on birthcontrol and that is fine"".

After that I just couldn't be bothered anymore. Clearly I was on my own even though someone with PCO often need help stabilizing the blood sugar. I guess this is a even bigger reason to continue with Keto and avoid all carbs.

Here you have the option of posting the outcome of your cycle (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community.

For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.

For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on /r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, /r/InfertilityBabies. Of course, you are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences (and continue to support other community members) here on /r/infertility.

Gearing up now for an anticipated FET on Oct 19th and doctor had me repeat blood work. Doctor's office called yesteray asking me to repeat CBC as platelets were low again and they want to make sure they're not dropping.

I just got my labs back from CD3 (its a redo of earlier ones in Jan since my cycle has been out of whack since my last D&C).  My doctor isnt available to really interpret these for me for a few days and I am kind of going crazy since my cycle has been so nuts.

The estradiol is 183 which the nurse said indicates I was in follicular phase...but I was on day 3 of my cycle (really light cycle but 8 days long)

She said FSH was normal, didnt mention the levels
&nbsp;

256,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone. 

I just want to say that if I don't belong in this particular group, please let me know. I haven't been ""officially"" diagnosed with infertility, but I have been having a hell of a time trying to get pregnant. I've only been trying since May -- I'm at the end of my 5th cycle -- so I'm aware it's early. 

But the things that are going on with my body leave me very few people who I can talk to, and I don't know anyone else in my situation, so I thought, maybe here. Again, if this isn't the place, let me know.

I first went in to.my doctor in August, after my period came a week early and lasted 9 days. Looking back, I should have gone in a lot earlier. My periods had always lasted way too long (10 or 11 days even) and my cycles were pretty irregular. I just didn't notice or care until I was trying to get pregnant. 

My doctor has been a freaking blessing. She didn't care that I hadn't been trying for long, she gave me an ultrasound to check for physical issues, a blood panel, and prescribed me progesterone right off the bat before my blood work had even come back. Ultrasound didn't show any issues, thank goodness, and my blood panel came back fine except for elevated blood sugar. So I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes. I cut out sugar from my diet, and took the progesterone pills and thought maybe this month. 

When my next cycle started, I was temping and taking OPKs every day and doing everything my doctor said to do to time sex. She had said ""as soon as the OPK is positive, have sex that night."" But it never got positive. It stayed at exactly the same level of not positive for three weeks, and my temps didn't show anything either, so I went back in. 

She gave me another ultrasound, confirmed I hadn't ovulated, and prescribed Metformin to help with my blood sugar levels and get my to ovulate next month. 

So now I'm just waiting for my period to come, knowing there hasn't been even a chance of a baby for who knows how long, and there might not be next month either. I hope the Metformin works, but I'm terrified that it won't. She said if it doesn't, we can start Clomid in November, so at least there is a plan. 

It just seems like everyone who started trying around the same time as me is already pregnant. And the few who aren't are at least ovulating regularly and have pretty charts that prove their body is working. 

I am so angry at my body for not doing what it's supposed to, and so angry at myself for not recognizing it sooner. I'm trying to hold out hope for the next cycle but it is so hard to not just give up.

Ultrasound didn&#39;t show any issues, thank goodness, and my blood panel came back fine except for elevated blood sugar. So I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes. I cut out sugar from my diet, and took the progesterone pills and thought maybe this month. </p>

<p>When my next cycle started, I was temping and taking OPKs every day and doing everything my doctor said to do to time sex. She had said &quot;as soon as the OPK is positive, have sex that night.&quot; But it never got positive. It stayed at exactly the same level of not positive for three weeks, and my temps didn&#39;t show anything either, so I went back in. </p>

<p>She gave me another ultrasound, confirmed I hadn&#39;t ovulated, and prescribed Metformin to help with my blood sugar levels and get my to ovulate next month. </p>

<p>So now I&#39;m just waiting for my period to come, knowing there hasn&#39;t been even a chance of a baby for who knows how long, and there might not be next month either. I hope the Metformin works, but I&#39;m terrified that it won&#39;t. She said if it doesn&#39;t, we can start Clomid in November, so at least there is a plan. </p>

<p>It just seems like everyone who started trying around the same time as me is already pregnant. And the few who aren&#39;t are at least ovulating regularly and have pretty charts that prove their body is working. </p>

<p>I am so angry at my body for not doing what it&#39;s supposed to, and so angry at myself for not recognizing it sooner. I&#39;m trying to hold out hope for the next cycle but it is so hard to not just give up. </p>

<p>Sorry for the novel... again, let me know if this isn&#39;t the right sub for me.</p>

In early 2014 my gyno did a bunch of tests to see why I wasn't getting pregnant and she found out that I had a couple polyps in my uterus. She told me this could be the reason why I wasn't getting pregnant so I ended up getting a hysteroscopy in September 2014 to remove them. Luckily the polyps came back benign so my husband and I thought we would get pregnant shortly after that surgery. 

Fast forward to a couple months ago and I thought that since I still wasn't getting pregnant I should see a RE at a fertility clinic near my home. He told me he wanted to do another HSG and a bunch of bloodwork. I was devastated when he told me that my uterus looked like it had been scarred from my surgery 2 years ago, and that it was tiny and misshapen. He told me I could get another surgery where they would remove the scar tissue and place a balloon in my uterus for about 10 days to hopefully prevent more scarring. 

I decided to think about it over the weekend and my husband and I both felt that we wanted to talk to some good friends of ours and ask if she would be willing to be a surrogate for us. Amazingly she said yes instantly and said she had even been thinking about it for the  last couple years! We have been ecstatic and we plan to tell our RE that we want to go ahead with IVF because we have a surrogate already who is willing and able to do it. (My surrogate is 29, has had 5 successful and easy pregnancies, no complications, and she had her tubes tied last year because she knew she was done having her own children).

So I guess my question is, I was wondering if my results from my Ovarian Assessment Report look ok or even good (hopefully) for us to have a successful IVF and surrogacy. Also, any additional info someone may have regarding surrogacy would be awesome. Thanks guys and I appreciate your help because I don't fully understand what each of the tests should be if they were 'optimal' for someone my age.

Switched clinics, I had an unsuccessful IUI and my 3rd round of IVF was cancelled, because I fell down a flight of stairs in April.

I've done my best, but I've had two major obstacles on top of my normal levels of stress (which, I'll be honest, are not the lowest lately). 

We are in our first IVF cycle and we did a FET because we needed genetic testing due to a genetic condition. We did both PGD and PGS, so we had a few conversations with out doctor about whether we would want to know the sex and/or pick the sex of the embryo [side note: I still find it amazing that they can do genetic testing and know this much about embryos so early]. My husband and I discussed it and decided that we didn't want to know the sex until after we knew whether or not this cycle worked (after the blood test on day 12) at least. That way, we wouldn't get our hopes up. I wanted to soften the blow for us as much as possible if it doesn't work, and I felt that knowing the sex would make the picture in my head too vivid and make the whole thing harder in the end potentially.

So on Thursday, the transfer was complete, and I was laying on the table having to pee like crazy and waiting for the 10 minute clock to be over so I could go pee. The doctor said he was leaving, but the embryologist would be in to talk to me. So a minute later she comes in, and she said that they transferred one embryo (due to having done PGS, they only transfer one), and it was an unaffected male....

MALE? It took me a minute to realize it, but she just told me the sex. I mumbled something about not wanting to know that and she said something else and left. 

...I was in shock. I was uncomfortable, on this table with my legs up, without my husband, and I just found out the sex before I even know whether this worked. I felt like that moment of finding out has been taken away from us forever if this cycle works. If it doesn't, then it's a wash, but of course I'm hoping for this cycle to work. 
I don't know what to do...but I just know that it was not the smoothest way to start the 2ww. 

After that, I quickly told a nurse what just happened, and left very unceremoniously. When I got home, I sent my doctor a message on the portal that he no longer needed to hide it from us, but haven't heard back yet. 


The second thing stressing me out is that my family just got into a huge blow up. Luckily, I am not a part of the actual blow up, but everyone is miserable, and I am getting some of the residual anger. I know I have to remove myself from the situation for the sake of my potential future family, but I'm worried that will make things worse. This is the most important thing to me right now, but how do I turn my brain off and tell it to stop worrying about all of this?

First of all, let me preface this by saying that the new doctor is a breath of fresh air. When we got to the clinic (which is attached to a hospital), we only had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get in. The doctor took us into his office and spent nearly 45 minutes going over our histories, asking, questions, and giving us his thoughts. He spent more time with us in that visit than our old doctor did for the entire 4 months we were his patients. After he spoke with us and went over our options (which I'll talk about in a minute), he sent us to a small conference room and the nurse came to go over tests and other things with us that we would be having done in the coming weeks. Then the financial/benefits consultant came in and went over our benefits with us (we have none) and discussed what our options were and how much each would cost. After that we went to the lab to have some blood drawn and then paid our copay and left. All told, we were at the clinic for about 2 hours, but it was probably the most productive two hours I've ever spent at a doctor's office. I feel like we now have all the information we need and we can make informed, educated decisions about how to proceed.

So onto to diagnosis. Previously we were told that my husband's sperm count and motility were low and he was put on several different kinds of medicine to correct this. THe new doctor does not think that this was/is the case at all. My husband's SA was in March and apparently the lab that did the test has a terrible reputation for inaccurate test results. The doctor said he would trust that lab to tell if there was sperm in the sample and that was about it. We delayed any treatment of me for 2 months because of that lab's SA results and my husband was put on clomid, bromocriptine, and L-carnitine based on those results. He had a repeat SA done in June which came back significantly improved. The new doctor said April (when the meds started) to June was not enough time to see the improvements in the SA that we did (9million to 88million and 10% motility to 47%). So he doesn't think my husband ever had a MFI problem. And after doing some research about sperm production and all of that, I agree. I am just floored that our old RE didn't double check the SA to begin with.

Now to me. He thinks I have PCOS, which I already knew, but he was appalled that I never had a baseline ultrasound done or an HSG or any kind of hormone panels other than Day 3 labs. My thyroid had never been checked and neither had my testosterone levels or anything else. He said those were our first steps to accurately diagnose my PCOS and to make sure that there weren't other factors causing issues with my fertility. He reviewed the treatments we had tried (one clomid cycle, one letrozole cycle) and he thought that for me clomid was probably the way to do go. We'll make a final decision next week at our follow-up once all the test results are in, but he thinks given my poor response to letrozole, clomid is the way to go. He gave us four options, Clomid with ultrasound monitoring and IUI ($1300), clomid with ultrasound monitoring and timed intercourse ($700), clomid with OPK monitoring and IUI ($400), and clomid with opk monitoring and time intercourse (cost of the clomid). We chose to do OPK moitoring and IUI. If that doesn't work, we'll do ultrasound and IUI the next month. He was very, very encouraging about our chances of conceiving this way. Our old doctor was ready to put us on injectables even though I know I ovulate with clomid. He never even gave us that option.

So anyway, overall, I'm very relieved that we switched doctors. The stress that our old doctor was putting us under just wasn't worth it and since switching we've encountered numerous other couples who had issues with our original RE. We have so much more hope than we did a few weeks ago and I really feel like this new doctor truly wants to help us and will do whatever needs to be done to help us get pregnant. And the big plus is that his practice is run out of a women's hospital, which is one of the best in the entire region.

I have a cramp in my calf that I noticed about a week ago. Went away & noticed it again today. It's mildly uncomfortable & seems to be worse when I don't have my leg extended. 

A few days ago I was reading the insert that came w my PIO & noticed that it said if you have a cramp in your calf, notify your doctor immediately due to risk of blood clot. Since my calf cramp went away, I didn't think much of it. But now that it's back, I'm worried. 

My clinic doesn't have a 24hr line so I'm going to call first thing & see what they say. 

I've been on PIO since last Saturday (.5cc every other day) & 2 endometrin suppositories per day since Sept 9. FET was Sept 14. Been on aspirin for several weeks as well. 

My mom suggested I could be low on magnesium so I'm eating a 1/3 cup of pumpkin seeds while I write this. 

Has anyone experienced a blood clot or a blood clot scare? As stated, I'm calling the clinic first thing but in the meantime I have nothing to do but freak out a little.
