I'm 29 F. My husband is a transman so we've always known our methods of reproducing would have challenges. We've wanted kids for a while but finally felt ready to start trying last fall. My ultrasounds, bloodwork and overall health is really good! My periods are regular and I always seem to ovulate when we check. I respond to OPKs (when they work, lol).

Yet, I'm not pregnant. We've spent the last 10 months doing IUIs and have never had success. 8 of those months I've been on Clomid and responded well (2-3 eggs each time). After a couple tries the fertility doctor suggested IVF, but we were stubborn (or stupid) and kept hoping it would work. The fertility doctor suggested I may have endo but I...personally don't know if I buy it. After all, my only symptom is not being pregnant yet, but there's no other explanation at the moment. I don't know if I want to do a scope yet. 

It's taken a great toll on both my mental/emotional wellbeing and our finances. We're taking a break for the next two months to give my body a break and sit down and consider some things, so here I am talking to ya'll.

If we went with IVF, I have two major concerns; obviously the price ($30,000 not including sperm; I live in the US) and our emotional wellbeing if it doesn't work. They pegged my numbers and said I had a 67% chance of success. I don't know if those are good or bad odds but it's a lot to stake money that would take us several years to obtain. I'm really scared if we do it and it doesn't work I....just don't know how I would cope. I don't know how you all have. I admire you all. 

Could you tell me your thoughts? What would you do in my shoes? I realize I'm early in my journey compared to many of you and I apologize if I come across as naive or offensive. I'm very scared and upset because there's so many unknowns right now. My husband is very caring and supportive, but he's known his whole life he'd never have biological children and I'm facing that potential reality right now and it scares the crap out of me. 

I've read a lot of your posts and it's comforting to know that I'm not actually alone. Thank you for reading.

(Also, I'm a PACU nurse and work with a lot of miscarriages, endo scopes and pregnant meth heads ((always fun)) and it's tough to wake up and go to work each day and deal with it by myself.

We initially had to do ivf/ icsi due to MFI- my husband had total blockage due to bilateral hernia repair. But as the time has gone by, I believe my egg quality has declined and become an issue as well.

Mentions- our first retrieval cycle resulted in 4 pgs normal embryos. Our first FET was successful and Pregnancy was uneventful. End mentions.

My question is- I feel like I need to see a new clinic- at least a consultation. But what questions do I ask?? Our issue at this point seems to be implantation or receptivity.

A brief review of my reproductive history (*****IVF success and pregnancy loss mentioned.*****)

Tried to conceive the first time for 2.5 years.  Diagnosed MFI and PCOS.  No success with clomid or IUIs.  Tried IUI with injectables, over-responded and converted fo IVF. 

IVF #1 (5/2015) - Live birth after fresh 3DT of single embryo.  5 blasts frozen, later thawed for PGS testing.  3 euploid, 1 abnormal, 1 no result.  

FET #1 (6/2018) - 1 6AA, PGS normal blast transferred.  Successful transfer, strong heartbeat on US, Subchorionic bleed during 1st trimester that resolved by 8 weeks.  Fetal demise at 14 weeks.  No obvious cause detected.  D&E complicated by major hemorrhage, blood transfusion required.

FET #2 (2/2019) - 1 PGS normal blast transferred.  Faint lines on HPTs during 2WW, but faded over time and negative on beta day.  Chemical pregnancy.

FET #3 (4/2019) - 1 PGS normal and 1 no result blast transferred together.  Beta positive but rose slowly and started to decline at 6 weeks.  No gestational sac on US.  Chemical pregnancy.  At this point we’re out of embryos so we took some time off to decide how we wanted to proceed.

IVF #2 (2/2020) - 25 retrieved, 17 fertilized, 12 blasts.  We didn’t PGS test this time because it didn’t do us any good last time and because it was too expensive for so many embryos.  Freeze all due to mild OHSS.  Then delayed due to Covid.

FET #4 (6/2020) - Transferred 1 5AA blast.  Beta 4.2 at 11dp5dt.  Chemical pregnancy.

After my 2nd tri loss, I had the following testing:

TSH - normal
APS testing - normal 
Karotyping (my husband too) - normal
Hysteroscopy - performed several times because my RE likes to do one before every transfer - always normal, except a couple small polyps removed.
Clotting panel - basic stuff (PTT, PT/INR, CBC) all normal, but my RE didn’t want to do the more advanced stuff.  Instead he just put me on Lovenox and baby aspirin for all the transfers after my second tri loss.  

With every transfer my hormone levels have been perfect and my lining has been adequate.  I just can’t figure out why my body was able to stay pregnant once but has failed every time since, especially with PGS normal embryos.

I have my WTF appointment coming up and I plan to ask about further clotting studies, as well as immune testing.  Is there anything else that should be on my list of questions?  I also have a second opinion consult scheduled.",t2_6zr4qlq6,False,,0,False,4 consecutive pregnancy losses...where would you go from here?,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_hdeiqg,False,dark,0.74,,public,7,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},TW: Mention of Children,False,7,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1592802321.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone.

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”.

If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

<p>I was wondering if anyone had any experiences with trying to do remote monitoring out on Long Island. I am concerned that many places won’t allow us to do remote monitoring because of COVID and we might have to drive back and forth which will just add to the stress.</p>

I have been doing IVF for the last \~ 2 years.  I've have had a string of bad luck.  I was first diagnosed with DOM and problematic fibroids that needed to be removed.   I had open surgery to remove 17 fibroids.  Ever since the surgery, my uterus has had a bit of fluid.  My RE wasn't concerned so we pushed forward with a stim in early 2019 when my uterus was healed. The stim produced 10 eggs, 8 of which developed into blasts.  We did a fresh transfer with 2 embryos and nothing.  PGS testing of the remaining 6 embryos revealed that they were chromosomally abnormal.   The RE said there was nothing to be done about the quality and to just repeat. I wasn't satisfied so I ended up switching clinics, my new RE had a plan for egg quality that seemed to work.  I ended up with 4 eggs retrieved and 3 blasts which were chromosomally normal.  So we tried to transfer, but the transfer was canceled because of this persistent fluid and the presents of new fibroids.  So I had to undergo another surgery to remove fibroids and the one tube that was blocked and assumed to be the source of the fluid (Dec 2019 at this point).  While in there the surgeon found a ""smidge"" endometriosis. Once healed, we started another transfer cycle (non-med) but the fluid persisted, so the cycle was canceled again (Feb 2020). Enter the devil of IVF meds, Depot Lupron.  I was put on a 2-month protocol of depot lupron that was extended to 3 months b/c of COVID (1 month DL, Birth control, then back on DL). The fluid finally disappeared, a beautiful 4AB embryo was transferred (58% live birth rate). The embryo didn't take.  If felt like my soul was snatched out of my body and like I just can't win. 

The struggle here is that I just don't know if there is something wrong with my uterus or me that I am missing.  Soon I will have the RPL panel, my RE indicated that there is correlation between RPL and failed transfers.  Is there anything else I should get tested for??

So I'm fairly new to fertility treatment. I've been dealing with secondary infertility for about 9 months now, (I'm 36 next month) and in April, I started fertility treatment at a fairly busy clinic. I say busy because a) I feel like all the staff is constantly rushing me/makes a TON of mistakes; and b) I have legit waited for 3+ hours for *scheduled* appointments. Anywho. This past cycle, I has about a 5 minute consult with my RE, who said that he wanted to start me on letrozole and progesterone. I've always suspected a short luteal phase, so I was quite excited about this. Without going into too much detail, I had said that I wanted this cycle to simply be one with timed intercourse, but I felt the doc was pushing for me to try IUI (this was only my 3rd cycle with the clinic, so I really felt jumping to letrozole, progesterone AND IUI was a little premature). I found it strange that every time I met with the doc, he kept questioning me about why I wasn't doing IUI, and I kept telling him the same thing - that I wanted to wait and see what would happen with just the drugs. Finally, he offered to give me a pretty generous discount for the IUI (like, more than 50% off), and I thought, maybe this is an opportunity I should go for, and my husband and I decided to go ahead with it.

After that, everything happened really quickly, without really any discussion/consultation. Here's where the real question starts. I already have a fairly  short cycle (average of 24-26 days), and because of the letrozole/IUI combo, it was discovered that I had 2 good follicles on day 9 of my cycle, and I was given a trigger shot on day 10, with my IUI performed on days 11 and 12. I presume that I ovulated in the evening on day 11. I usually ovulate on day 14-15. With my calculations, with being on progesterone this month, my cycle will be 24, maybe 25 days this month. So my question is: is it normal for ovulation to happen this early on letrozole? Clearly everything was planned for me, and maybe my follicles were big enough to be triggered ""early"", but it did feel a bit rushed. I'm just trying to assess if I should be going to this clinic after this cycle. I think I already have my answer, but I wanted to know if the way they handled this cycle was questionable or not.

I had one 8 week loss a few years ago and 3 losses in the last 9 months, all before 8 weeks. The latest was definitely what you&#39;d call a chemical. I&#39;ve seen an RE and had full RPL testing - blood clotting disorders, thyroid, MTHFR, karyotyping, HSG, etc. They found nothing wrong. My TSH was just barely over 2.5 so they put me on levothyroxine and it&#39;s been under 1 since. This cycle I tried 100mg progesterone 2x/day from 3 dpo + baby aspirin every day, and unfortunately that ended in another loss. I also have been taking 300mg CoQ10, prenatals (folate), Vitamin C, D and zinc daily for 4 months. My RE doesn&#39;t seem to think anything else can be tried or done.

I have tried searching Reddit for some answers but haven't quite found what I was looking for (or maybe I just need to wait for more info from my OB tomorrow?)

I had my HSG test day. It was painful and horrible. My left tube is open and fine. My right tube is partially obstructed by adhesions I believe and I also have a small polyp or fibroid (or are they the same thing?) in my uterus. This is what the OB nurse told me today after the doctor reviewed my xrays.

I don't believe I have endo but then again I'm not quite sure what the symptoms are. Sometimes the first day of my period is pretty painful but I can usually power through it with some whining, ice cream and Tylenol. That being said, I don't know what could have caused adhesions - no surgeries and no known history of STIs.

I have a detailed phone call with my OBGYN tomorrow to go over my results in depth and probably see what next steps are.

Do you have suggestions of what I should ask her about my results, or what to ask of what possible next steps are? I want to make sure I make the most of this phone call and be as informed as possible so I can try to make the next step sooner rather than later but not rush into something.

I understand a lap surgery is an option to remove adhesions but from what I am hearing it can lower my ovarian reserve? Maybe it's not worth it? I have not tested my ovarian reserve.

Not really sure why I’m posting this I guess it would be nice if anyone’s who been through this before would drop any tips?

Edit: a couple edits, thank you all so much for your kind words and amazing advice.🥺💗 just to clarify the reason he told me over the phone was because him and I live about 2 hours away from each other, so I truly don’t get to see him that much 😩 

And as far as his parents go... they are strict immigrant parents haha. They are from Africa and they brought him here when he was little. So it could be a cultural thing with the whole kids issue.

I know this can be a lot for people and I didn’t want to make him go through anything that he wasn’t ready for.

**Anyone have similar experiences with a found solution? In a perfect world I’d like to have normal length cycles including ovulation (so no BC), but would settle for a logical reason why this is happening.**

Full story:
Been trying to conceive since January 2018. Started seeing gynecologist since April 2018, found severe hypothyroidism right away and then took over a year to find I have PCOS. Went to Endocrinologist who also found hyperinsulemia, but helped me get my thyroid and insulin numbers back to normal by end of 2019.

Took letrozole/Femara 5mg for 2 “cycles” (June-September 2019), did nothing. Took 7.5mg for 3 months (September-December 2019) which worked but I still had longer than normal cycles (average 33 days).

Went to fertility clinic and did timed intercourse rounds January-March 2020. Used letrozole, gonal-f, and trigger shot every month. Could only do 2 cycles because of COVID-19, insurance changing, and finances. We stopped intentionally trying to conceive but haven’t been using any prevention (seriously, what’s the point?).

Since my late March period, my cycles have been barely more than 2 weeks long, meaning I’m not ovulating and/or my luteal phase is not long enough and/or my hormones are still not producing correctly. Checked my thyroid and insulin levels again and everything is normal so Endocrinologist referred me back to gynecologist.

Gynecologist said yesterday that my only option is birth control. I’ve never had a successful experience with BC and don’t want to keep myself from ovulating intentionally, so I asked about letrozole again. She can not prescribe because she was only supposed to give it to me for 3 months and already gave it to me for longer.

To reiterate the question, I’d love to hear a solution that includes ovulation. I’m not looking for sympathy, but similar stories with something successful or a hard-to-find diagnosis would be great. It doesn’t make any sense to me that I have my numbers under control yet my body cannot produce the correct hormones to do what it’s supposed to do...

Already tried lots of “natural” PCOS solutions like vitex and similar, none worked and just felt like I was throwing money away. Here are my cycles for reference.

16 days (March 27-April 11)
15 days (April 12-26)
14 days (April 27-May 10)
16 days (May 11-26)
17 days (May 27-June 12)

If you read this far, I really appreciate it even if you don’t have an answer or similar experience. Feels like my body is out of control and won’t do what it was biologically made to do...

IUI and IVF would not have been covered under either insurance and we were surprised in January that my husband’s company was closing in April (then got pushed earlier with COVID), so we were not willing to risk our cushion in the bank.

69,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello, so last month my cycle was cancelled and I am still pretty confused about what happened. I had a small cyst at the beginning of my cycle but the doctor said that it should be fine. My AFC was 14 but my body didn't respond well to the stimulants so we had to cancel the cycle which seems pretty straight forward but on day 8 they said that my progesterone had risen. The nurse said that I must have ovulated shortly after my bleeding ended. I had been on birth control before starting the IVF so that ovulation was suppose to be suppressed. The doctor denied that I ovulated stating that the small cyst somehow activated and was causing the progesterone rise. Has anyone ever heard of a cyst getting activated mid cycle? I got my period very quickly after stopping the stimulants. It was a 13 day cycle from when I had my period after stopping birth control, but a fairly normal cycle if you take out the bleeding after stopping the birth control and assume that the birth control did not prevent ovulation. The nurse again told me I had ovulated, but the doctor still hasn't said I ovulated. I am worried/annoyed about getting the conflicted messages from the same clinic. 

I took my birth control every morning, but I was not paying close attention to the time each morning. I have never been on birth control before and with all these more intense meds I just did not think it was a big deal. I did not even look up instructions on how to take it so fuck me if I messed the whole thing up. If I did ovulate would that have screwed up the rest of the cohort development?

Anyhow, the reason I am so concerned about the whether or not I ovulated is because my doctor is now recommending mini IVF. At first I felt encouraged but the more I have read about it the less good I feel. She is saying I may have a low ovarian reserve but she is basing it off of the poor response to stimulants. My other numbers have all been in the normal range. It just seems to me like there are a lot of other extraneous factors i.e. cyst and possible ovulation which might be preventable in another cycle. Does any one have or know of experiences of people responding differently to stimulants one time vs another?  I have an appointment with the doctor in a week so I wanted to reach out to this community and see if they have any suggestions on what to ask my doctor and see what people think about her recommending mini IVF so quickly. This was my first attempted round of IVF.

I had a small cyst at the beginning of my cycle but the doctor said that it should be fine. My AFC was 14 but my body didn&#39;t respond well to the stimulants so we had to cancel the cycle which seems pretty straight forward but on day 8 they said that my progesterone had risen. The nurse said that I must have ovulated shortly after my bleeding ended. I had been on birth control before starting the IVF so that ovulation was suppose to be suppressed. The doctor denied that I ovulated stating that the small cyst somehow activated and was causing the progesterone rise. Has anyone ever heard of a cyst getting activated mid cycle? I got my period very quickly after stopping the stimulants. It was a 13 day cycle from when I had my period after stopping birth control, but a fairly normal cycle if you take out the bleeding after stopping the birth control and assume that the birth control did not prevent ovulation. The nurse again told me I had ovulated, but the doctor still hasn&#39;t said I ovulated. I am worried/annoyed about getting the conflicted messages from the same clinic. </p>

Been a lurker of this subreddit for a while now and posting for the first time as we are planning to start our IVF journey soon. We are in located in Canada so our first round of IVF is funded by the government (other than the drugs), we’ve been on the waiting list for almost a year and our scheduled IVF cycle is coming up in July. I’m wondering if it is worth it to try a cycle of medicated IUI in June or just rest up to prepare for IVF? 

The reason why I’m asking is because our doctor mentioned that these medicated IUI cycles can give him more information on how my body reacts to the fertility drugs and hence adjust our IVF protocol accordingly. I’ve only had one natural cycle IUI done before and that ended in an early CP. I originally wanted to do the medicated IUI cycle earlier on so I have some rest time in between but our clinic was closed due to COVID. Now with only one cycle in between before IVF, I’m just not sure if it will be worth it to try the medicated IUI (to get some additional information since I’ve already accepted that chance of IUI working is low) or just let my body rest up to prepare for IVF. 

My husband (29) has MFI (low count and motility) and I (31) have polycystic ovaries (but no PCOS symptoms) and my hormone levels looked fine from our natural IUI cycles. 

The IUI protocol I was given is 2.5mg of letrozole for 5 days and then Oviderel to trigger.

We are trying donor embryos one more time. This is the last time we can afford to do this- both financially and emotionally. 

My RE gave us 4 options:
1.) birth control 2 weeks, then Claritin, Pepcid, baby aspirin, progesterone and transfer (the protocol we’ve been doing) 
2.) birth control for 2 months, add heprin (sp?) plus Claritin, Pepcid, baby aspirin, progesterone and transfer
3.)  Lupron for 3 months while on birth control plus Claritin, Pepcid, baby aspirin, progesterone and transfer
4.) surgery to remove endo, lupron while on birth control for 3 months plus Claritin, Pepcid, baby aspirin, progesterone and transfer

Since we are using donor embryos I guess the DOR really doesn’t play much into this so the endometriosis is the only factor affecting our choice.

<p>We are trying donor embryos one more time. This is the last time we can afford to do this- both financially and emotionally. </p>

<p>My RE gave us 4 options:
1.) birth control 2 weeks, then Claritin, Pepcid, baby aspirin, progesterone and transfer (the protocol we’ve been doing) 
2.) birth control for 2 months, add heprin (sp?) plus Claritin, Pepcid, baby aspirin, progesterone and transfer
3.)  Lupron for 3 months while on birth control plus Claritin, Pepcid, baby aspirin, progesterone and transfer
4.) surgery to remove endo, lupron while on birth control for 3 months plus Claritin, Pepcid, baby aspirin, progesterone and transfer</p>

<p>Since we are using donor embryos I guess the DOR really doesn’t play much into this so the endometriosis is the only factor affecting our choice. </p>

<p>Honestly I don’t even know what my question is. I guess I’m trying to decide what to do. Has anyone had positive experiences with any of the protocols above? Pros/cons? Any advice would be appreciated just so I have a better understanding.</p>

I am wondering whether I should move to IVF or continue with IUIs and whether there is anything more we can check at this point as RE says there is nothing else we should be tested for.

Here is a little context to my question. My husband and I have decided to have kids around 3 years ago, but actively trying around 2 years.
1 year ago I got referral to RE and have done all the tests: hormones (normal), AMH (normal), VIT D (below range, but got a prescription of 10.000 dose for 2 months, and resume taking since 2 months ago of 5000UI), HSG (no issues), husband SA (normal), genetic testing (Husband unlikely carrier, and I am a carrier of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency (AR), but we were not told this may impact getting pregnant).

Without RE’s advice, we decided to go to urologist and test my husband’s hormones. His testosterone and FSH came back lower than normal, which we were surprised given that SA and IUI’s numbers were great. He was also VIt D deficient. Can this impact our chances when SA is within normal range? The urologist has also recommended to do Tunel sperm analysis (not covered by insurance), but we haven’t done that and not sure how critical is this, but we’ll eventually do this if needed.

At this point I am taking prenatal, Ubiqinoul, (100mg), aspirin (81mg), folic acid (800mg every other day), D3 (5000), iron, DHEA, if relevant.

I would really appreciate if anyone can share any relevant experience with unexplained diagnosis and found some answers later or have any other advice.

102,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, I found out today that my fourth transfer was a chemical. Beta of 76 on 9dpt dropped to 25 today. I am seeking any advice or suggestions on what to try next.

My story:

Age 31, 29 when we started trying, in great shape, no other health conditions. HSG revealed hydrosalpinx, surgery to remove the tubes revealed stage IV endometriosis. Never had any pain or symptoms, periods were always like clockwork. Husband's SA is fine.

We then did two retrievals, which yielded a total of 6 PGS normal embryos. Did three transfers, all beta of 0. Tried natural as well as medicated transfers. Lining was always ""perfect"" with medicated transfers, nearly perfect with natural transfers.

Transfers were ""difficult,"" with the third one taking an hour. My endo scarring was so bad that RE had trouble getting through the cervix.

After the third failure, we took two months off to treat endo with Depot Lupron/Letrozole. Other changes included transfer under sedation, transferred 2 embryos at a time, hysteroscopy/""scratch""/putting in a stitch to make transfer easier (which did help, she said), added Lovenox, added Crinone, baby aspirin, extra 24 hours of progesterone.

I pushed for ERA, but my RE said 1. ERA studies exclude endo patients; 2. doing the ERA would undo some of the effects of the Lupron before transfer, because the estrogen inflames the endo; and 3. she wasn't sure she could physically do it on me because of my weird cervix. So instead of ERA, we just did an extra day of progesterone.

One thing seems clear to me at this point: Although my RE and clinic have been great, they haven't gotten me pregnant. It's time for a second opinion and probably switch to a new clinic. I'm in a fairly large city with a few other clinics. One normal embryo and two mosaics left.

Other questions:

Is it meaningful/hopeful that we finally achieved implantation this time, even if it was only for a couple days?

Is surgery to excise endo worth considering?

Should we try the Lupron/Letrozole again? Maybe this was our first real shot, since it was our first time using that drug to quiet the endo, and just need to give it another chance.

Is reproductive immunology (Kwak-Kim, etc) a fringe field that preys on desperate people, or is it worth  pursuing?

Fresh transfer with untested embryos, just to try something else?

Or is it time to move to surrogacy? I've seen a few, albeit not many, people online who had success on transfer 5 or 6. At 31, after one full year of treatment, I feel very exhausted and depressed, but I also feel there is still time to keep trying. However, I only want to keep trying if there's still a reasonable shot at success.

Thank you. Feeling absolutely gutted and cannot believe this is my reality.

Here's my history, I'm currently SMBC (trying to be), so no partner, using Donor Sperm.

At 38.5, my AFC was 13 and my AMH was 1.66 and FSH 9.39

At 40.5 my AFC was 4 and my AMH was .62 and FSH 9.94

\--Did two retrievals at age 39. Froze four and six eggs respectively.  (Did not attempt to create embryos - just froze eggs.)

\--Did a retrieval in Feb at 40. Retrieved seven eggs, five mature, two embryos froze Day 3, both graded poor quality,  one 4 cells, one 5 cells.

\--Did a retrieval in early May at 40. Retrieved four eggs, three mature, two fertilized, two embryos frozen Day 3, one graded poor quality and 4 cells, one graded good quality and 5 cells.

All of the above were antagonist protocol, 300 GonalF/150 Menopur and Lupron/HCG dual trigger. The most recent retrieval I did I primed with low dose HGH for 8 weeks beforehand. I’ve been on the usual supplements the last 6 months - CoQ10, Vitamins, etc.

I have responded well to stims all cycles but then either number of eggs or number of fertilized ends very low at retrieval. My last retrieval, day of trigger my follicles were measuring 20mm, 19mm, 17mm, 17mm, 16mm, 15mm, 15mm, 15mm, 13mm, 13mm,  13mm, 12mm. But only 3 mature eggs.

I’m not optimistic about my chances of success with the embryos I've been able to freeze so far. Only one is good quality, and none of them are where they should be for cell count on Day 3. I haven’t moved to transfers yet. I just turned 41 and am planning on doing one more retrieval cycle before trying transfers. I also still have my ten frozen eggs to try to make embryos with. If none of the transfers work I am happy to move on to Donor Eggs/Embryos, but want to give it my all with OEs first. If this was you, what questions would you be asking RE?

Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Infertility includes: primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.

We are down to our last of seven embryos (from four rounds of IVF, none were genetically tested) and I’m wanting to try everything and the kitchen sink with this last embryo. 

Brief, or as brief as I can make it, background:

Each of our transfers followed the same protocol: 
Estradiol 2mg 2X/day starting about 17 days before transfer. 

Progesterone in oil 1.5mL daily starting about 5 days before transfer. 

Lining never an issue, one thing that has been consistently great. 

Transfer 1: AA embryo, implanted, had a healthy and easy pregnancy, but at 38w our son passed away in-utero due to an umbilical cord accident. 

Transfer 2: AB embryo, didn’t implant. 

Transfer 3: BA embryo, implanted, first beta 210, but then didn’t increase at the appropriate rate and eventually started decreasing.

Transfer 4: BB embryo (had thawing issues) and AB embryo, neither implanted. 

Transfer 5: BA embryo, implanted, first beta 72, five days later decreased to 9. 

So here we are. Transfer #6. Embryo #7, an AA. 

We don’t want the same protocol and will be switching doctors to get a fresh perspective. 
Up until now, our doctor has felt confident that it is all about finding the right embryo again. Because first transfer was a healthy pregnancy, she has felt confident my body is capable of pregnancy and that the protocol we were on worked so she wanted to keep repeating that protocol. And because we didn’t test the embryos, she has attributed our unsuccessful transfers to unhealthy embryos. 

It took me a long time to wrap my head around it because up until this most recent transfer, there wasn’t an evident trend (+, -, mc, -). But now I am questioning if perhaps it was the embryo or perhaps something has changed in my body since the first transfer, pregnancy, and traumatic birth to where maybe the embryos that did implant and had good first betas, somehow got rejected my body.

We have a consult with a doctor who specilizes in immune issues and even though I don’t think I have any, I’m wanting to explore anything and everything. I have researched various tests and treatment options to ask during the consult. 

So to bring it all together, have you had a last resort transfer where you threw the kitchen sink at it and changed things up? I’d love to hear what your kitchen sink was and ultimately if you think it made a difference.

142,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey everyone! :) 

I'm gearing up for my second round of IVF! My first round protocol was: 21 days priming with HBC, then starting stims after my CD1. I was on L-thyroxine each morning, and then Gonal-F 300, Menopur 150 and Dexamethasone each evening. I took cetrotide to keep from ovulating, and triggered after 13 days of stims with Lupron and HGC (pregnyl) duel trigger. They saw 11 or so follicles when I triggered, they got 6 and 5 were mature, 4 fertilized. They looked great on day 3, then most arrested by day 5-6, so I only ended up with 1 hatched 6BB blast that didn't stick. 

We have since found out there's a slight DNA frag problem on my husband's part, but the lab has a solution for that to separate the healthy sperm as much as possible, and we are trying to correct the issue as much as we can with diet and supplements on top of that.

SO, this time around my protocol is this: I was on HBC (initially 21 days, but turns into 12 weeks because of COVID), my CD1 we did a baseline test. I'm on thyroid meds again (my TSH was strangely higher, 4.3, at Christmas it was 1.6). But this cycle we are starting with 20 units of microdose Lupron on 7DPO. I'll continue the Lupron until my next CD1, which will be the stim cycle. I'll continue the Lupron, but it'll move down to 10 units. I'll be on Gonal-f 300 and menopur 150 again, + letrozole 5mg daily, plus the thyroid medication (I assume). Obviously I'm hoping for a better response this time!   


Anyone have a protocol similar to this? Is there anything else you took for supplements, did you stop supplements when you started stims or keep taking them? I plan on taking melatonin, because of the studies with egg quality. I've been trying to eat well and exercise often to have the best body I can going into this.  I've been trying to get more greens, so I started using this [Cytogreens](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1055/4732/products/cytogreens-Nutrition-Facts_c37efee3-8bae-4737-9ade-99fa56a975b9_1024x1024.png) powder in my smoothies most days. I take Acai berry, ubiquinol, probiotics, and omega 3-6-9s, Vit D, along with a prenatal, and I have for like.. a year now lol.

<p>I&#39;m gearing up for my second round of IVF! My first round protocol was: 21 days priming with HBC, then starting stims after my CD1. I was on L-thyroxine each morning, and then Gonal-F 300, Menopur 150 and Dexamethasone each evening. I took cetrotide to keep from ovulating, and triggered after 13 days of stims with Lupron and HGC (pregnyl) duel trigger. They saw 11 or so follicles when I triggered, they got 6 and 5 were mature, 4 fertilized. They looked great on day 3, then most arrested by day 5-6, so I only ended up with 1 hatched 6BB blast that didn&#39;t stick. </p>

<p>We have since found out there&#39;s a slight DNA frag problem on my husband&#39;s part, but the lab has a solution for that to separate the healthy sperm as much as possible, and we are trying to correct the issue as much as we can with diet and supplements on top of that.</p>

Focused on couples experiencing MFI, but of value to all of us (so I posted standalone!)

Something that especially resonated with me - sometimes I feel like my partner and I are coworkers assigned to this project of fertility and I’m the admin & PM (like I am with other aspects of running our household...). I struggle to not nag him about supplements and diet and when he should get another SA.

Husband (27) and I have been ttc for over 2 years. Never been on birth control (barrier method), never gotten a positive pregnancy test. Last fall we did blood tests and SA, all normal. At that time I did a medicated cycle with letrozole and hcg trigger. We also did an HSG which was painful on par with my worst cramps but only during the procedure. She got dye to spill. I had a lap done in January by my RE which confirmed stage 2 endometriosis. She did a mixture of excision and ablation. The chromopertubation made my tubes balloon up and she had to use a lot of pressure but got the dye to go through. 
It seems my tubes closed up a pretty good amount from Sept. to Jan., but RE didn't seem concerned. My pain (thankfully mostly contained to the first few cycle days) came back with next cycle and didn't improve after healing. The 2nd cycle after surgery a cyst prevented us from treatment, and then covid hit. I just finished my first (medicated) IUI which wasn't successful, and I'm trying to decide what's next. As far as I can tell from the cycles (mine are very consistent and predictable) where I chart carefully, I ovulate normally and usually around cd16. That's great news but also means I have had plenty of failed chances which is frustrating. I could do a second IUI. I think my husband is all in for IVF whenever I'm ready. I also think I need another surgery at some point for pain and have consulted with a nook dr. who is willing to operate.

Should also mention we're going to be moving next month and so surgery would have to wait until after we're settled. IUI in the meantime? Nix surgery altogether for now? How long does process of egg retrieval prep/procedure take?

I read up and now I&#39;m worried about egg quality even though my AMH was pretty high last year. Is there any other testing I should ask about, like uterus inflammation? </p>

<p>Should also mention we&#39;re going to be moving next month and so surgery would have to wait until after we&#39;re settled. IUI in the meantime? Nix surgery altogether for now? How long does process of egg retrieval prep/procedure take?</p>

<p>Any advice welcome!</p>

165,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"TL;DR: low amh, high fsh, first ivf attempt only had one follicle with an aggressive stim, switched to duo-stim in luteal phase with a lighter stim and retrieved two eggs which are now frozen in day 3 with good to excellent grades.

I wanted to share the journey for my IUI, IVF attempt, and the conversion to a Duo-Stim protocol for informational reasons.  I was diagnosed with low AMH, ranging from .25 to .7, and DOR, and my husband with low morphology.    We decided to try 2-3 rounds of IUI and at most 2 rounds of IVF for financial and emotional reasons, especially as we are not in a state that covers insurance.  The two rounds of IUI were performed at a local clinic, RMA of Michigan, while IVF and Duo-Stim were performed at CNY in Syracuse.  This is also a mini rant on RMA, which I've shared my experienced previously.

I typically have a 25 day cycle and am otherwise in great health.  I have abnormal pain during ultrasound, even with numbing, and especially as my right ovary apparently likes to hide during ovulation.  It's always weird to have the doctor say, ""good girl, you're doing great!"" during an ultrasound.

First round of IUI Oct 21, 2019 (third day of cycle): 100mg clomid and 1.2mg bromocriptine.  I was also placed on synthroid 50mcg because my TSH was weirdly high for this month only.  Had two mature follicles and triggered with Ovidrel.  This is when my issues began - for about 3 weeks, I was in pain and cramping.  I could not move without a sharp stabbing pain in my middle and peeing was difficult.  I believe I had OHSS, but every time I mentioned it to a nurse at my local clinic, each of them responded that some pain was normal and it was simply mittelschmerz.  I did not believe I was in danger as I could still pee, yet I spent the majority of the 3 weeks in bed or heavily reclined.  HCG tests are taken about the 2nd day of my shortened cycle and was negative.

Second round of IUI Nov 16, 2019: exact same protocol, but no synthroid. Had unusually high FSH (jumped from around 9 for the past 2 years to 17).  I asked the doctor if the intense pain and issues I had the previous round could have caused it and he vehemently denied.  Had only one mature follicle, but triggered with Ovidrel again.  Did not have any pain this round, only minor bloating.  HCG tests were negative once again.  

(Rant Portion): Was advised by the doctor that our only option now because of my suddenly high FSH was to proceed with IVF.  I mentioned that CNY was a cheaper option and asked if I could use the clinic for local monitoring; he assured me that RMA did that all the time.  I decided to take a break for the holiday season and started researching cheaper medications; I eventually ordered from IVFmeds, which I believe ships from Israel.  I called in early January to ask RMA of the protocols to schedule the  Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) and  Saline Sonogram (SHG) that CNY required and was told that it would simply be a phone call on the first day of my cycle, similar to a monitoring round and to email or fax the lab orders, which I promptly did.  When my cycle arrived, I called again and scheduled.  The nurse penned me in but said they had never received my lab orders, to which I replied was emailed. I do not believe they check their emails, and the nurse confirmed that they had received the orders.  I called again on a weekend to schedule and was then told for the first time that RMA does not do monitoring for other clinics, and that if I called the number on a weekend again, I would be charged a $25 fee as I was no longer a local patient.  The tests need to be performed on a certain day of my cycle, so this cancellation on a weekend meant that I could not complete the tests before my first round of IVF, thus delaying it another month.  I completed the tests in February, and in March, we drove out to CNY for hopefully my first cycle.  The next day I received a call from CNY stating that they had to close due to COVID, so I am so much more extremely angered by RMA's mismanagement.

First round of IVF May 6, 2020: I was placed on a high dosage stim protocol: Gonal-f 450 + menopur 150 iu from 5/7 to 5/14. I was also prescribed a z pak, 5mg prednisone 2x a day, and LDN 4.5mg 1x a day.  I started cetrotide .25mg on 5/12 until 5/14.  Unfortunately, only one follicle was mature, and I triggered with a HCG compound and it was at this point that I learned about duo-stim.  Dr. Kiltz said that usually it was done in for two rounds of IVF to minimize time spent and that there might be some benefits to doing a stim protocol during the luteal phase for poor responders.  I didn't want to waste the one mature follicle I had and asked if it was possible to do an IUI with a duo stim, especially since he stated that he would want to try luteal phase with me anyway for the next IVF round, and he said it was certainly possible since my nature FSH level was so high regardless that the medications shouldn't affect a possible pregnancy.  We decided to go for it.   (As a side note, I started developing a rash over my back on May 19 that we now believe is from a chemical in the compounded HCG trigger.  As I continued with a mini hcg-LH compound for the duo-stim, the rash spread and grew terribly).

Second round of IVF May 23, 2020 luteal phase duo-stim: When we returned to the clinic for the first day of monitoring 5/27, none of the nurses knew I was on duo-stim.  Most of them had not heard of it and they had to keep consulting the doctors.  My protocol this time was letrozole 10mg 5/23-5/27, Gonal-f 200 + hcg-LH 100 iu/ml 5/23 - 6/3.  Cetrotide .25mg 5/31- 6/3. Still the same LDN and prednisone from previous, no z-pack. There were five possible follicles, 3 on left and 2 on the right, in the early days, but then my right ovary went hiding and the nurses were not able to see it with vaginal or topical ultrasound, so we decided to proceed with the three mature follicles that could be seen. I triggered 6/4 at 8pm with Novidrel and went in for egg retrieval at 6:30am on 6/6.  (Second side note, the rash is now being controlled by hydroxyzine 75mg/day and prednisone 60mg/day and while the nurse believed that it was because of a substance in the HCG compound and that the Novidrel trigger should be fine, she stated that I could take a lupron trigger if I wished.  CNY nurses monitored the situation and called me several times during the day to prepare for this trigger - I was extremely grateful for this kind of care). For the egg retrieval, it was very odd because the nurses and even the doctor performing the procedure asked me if I was doing a fresh transfer, to which I replied, ""I can't possibly do a fresh transfer, since this is a duo stim and the timing would be completely off, right?""  They had not realized this was a duo stim protocol and placed it in my record.  I was still asked the question after the egg retrieval and was actually assigned progesterone priming instructions for the next few days. This was disconcerting. 2 mature eggs were retrieved, 1 from the left and 1 from the hiding right ovary. Due to CNY policy, if less than 4 eggs are retrieved, then they are frozen on day 3.  

My next step is to wait for my cycle to start - I am told that it will be approximately a week after the trigger, so possibly tomorrow, and to call with the first day of the cycle.  Then I will start priming and undergoing local monitoring with hopefully a transfer.  As of today, I am still having minor pain in my stomach area, especially after bending at the waist.

For cost reasons, we went with CNY as it was far cheaper even with hotel costs than to perform IVF at any of the local clinics.  The first time we stayed at Maplewood Suites, but the second time we stayed at the Hilton, which I preferred.  We were able to work remotely at both hotels, which was the only boon from this lockdown period.  

I hope this long-winded post was helpful.

Three years ago we had one cycle finally get to retrieval utilizing a natural start, clomid combined with a typical (but high dose) antagonist protocol. We ended up with two embryos at day 5. Fresh transfer resulted in live birth. 2nd transfer this year resulted in a CP. We were trying to do another cycle to bank before the transfer but my ovaries are being quite uncooperative. So, we've been attempting another IVF cycle for a year now. 

Current stats: 36, AMH ~0.4 (I think, not in my portal and I can't remember anymore). AFC has generally been around 2-4. FSH started last year at ~12 and then just keeps rapidly rising. We were attempting to do estrogen priming and got a dominant follicle and then another time a cyst. Tried again adding a month of testosterone patches and FSH had risen to 18 and my RE didn't want to start with that high of FSH so we scrubbed that. 

Intermission of cycling when my gallbladder decided to spit out a stone and land me in the hospital for 4 days with pancreatitis. Got that bugger out and then after the all clear from the surgeon transferred our frozen embryo resulting in a CP. 

Next FSH baseline was up to 36. At this point my RE is saying we are probably near out of options for IVF. We did Dr. Sher's Agonist/Antagonist Conversion Protocol. 

* We primed for 10 days with OCP, overlapped for 3 days with 10 units of lupron, then just the lupron until my period started. 

* 1/2 dose of ganirelix started (and continued until day of trigger) along with 2 mg oral estrace. 

* after 7 days we started stims with 225 units of menopur and 225 units of gonal/follistim. I also did 5 days of HGH. I stimmed for 10 days with the gonal/follistim increasing in the last couple of days.

* 3 follicles within the 16-21 window and I triggered with a single Ovidrel. 3 eggs retrieved, all 3 eggs were immature, nothing to fertilize. 

My RE is willing to give this another shot. We're priming with OCP and lupron, then ganirelix and estrace all the same. Plan is to start gonal/folistim at 450 and menopur at 150 this time, and add dexamethasone and 5 days of letrozole. She also wants to use the IM hCG trigger instead of Ovidrel. I wonder if that Ovidrel last cycle is why the eggs didn't mature, she said she didn't think it would be the cause of it though I've seen Dr. Sher's posts about using the 10,000 units of hCG or double Ovidrel in order to mature the eggs fully. 

I really want to make sure we're doing all we can for a good cycle here. I'm starting to spot from my last retrieval, so we're likely starting the OCP for priming in the next day or two and then on with this cycle. Anyone else have any input on this type of cycle? What's worked? What hasn't? I'm looking for any arm-chair quarterbacking (doctoring) at this point.

We were attempting to do estrogen priming and got a dominant follicle and then another time a cyst. Tried again adding a month of testosterone patches and FSH had risen to 18 and my RE didn&#39;t want to start with that high of FSH so we scrubbed that. </p>

<p>Intermission of cycling when my gallbladder decided to spit out a stone and land me in the hospital for 4 days with pancreatitis. Got that bugger out and then after the all clear from the surgeon transferred our frozen embryo resulting in a CP. </p>

<p>Next FSH baseline was up to 36. At this point my RE is saying we are probably near out of options for IVF. We did Dr. Sher&#39;s Agonist/Antagonist Conversion Protocol. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>We primed for 10 days with OCP, overlapped for 3 days with 10 units of lupron, then just the lupron until my period started. </p></li>
<li><p>1/2 dose of ganirelix started (and continued until day of trigger) along with 2 mg oral estrace. </p></li>
<li><p>after 7 days we started stims with 225 units of menopur and 225 units of gonal/follistim. I also did 5 days of HGH. I stimmed for 10 days with the gonal/follistim increasing in the last couple of days.</p></li>
<li><p>3 follicles within the 16-21 window and I triggered with a single Ovidrel. 3 eggs retrieved, all 3 eggs were immature, nothing to fertilize. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>My RE is willing to give this another shot. We&#39;re priming with OCP and lupron, then ganirelix and estrace all the same. Plan is to start gonal/folistim at 450 and menopur at 150 this time, and add dexamethasone and 5 days of letrozole. She also wants to use the IM hCG trigger instead of Ovidrel. I wonder if that Ovidrel last cycle is why the eggs didn&#39;t mature, she said she didn&#39;t think it would be the cause of it though I&#39;ve seen Dr. Sher&#39;s posts about using the 10,000 units of hCG or double Ovidrel in order to mature the eggs fully. </p>

<p>I really want to make sure we&#39;re doing all we can for a good cycle here. I&#39;m starting to spot from my last retrieval, so we&#39;re likely starting the OCP for priming in the next day or two and then on with this cycle. Anyone else have any input on this type of cycle? What&#39;s worked? What hasn&#39;t? I&#39;m looking for any arm-chair quarterbacking (doctoring) at this point. Thanks for reading this novel!</p>

My situation is a bit different. I was put on the cancer protocol for the Egg Freezing treatment because I'm considered high risk for breast cancer. The reason is that I had Atypical ductual hyperplasia (adh) in my breast 3 years ago.

My AMH: 2.25
AGE: 35
AFC: 19 at baseline US

The RE had me on: 
stims day 1-3: Gonal F 375 UN, 5mg letrozole (femara)
Day 4-10: Gonal F 300 UN, .25mg cetrotide, 75 UN menopur, 5mg letrozole (femara)
Day 11: .25 mg cetrotide, 40mg lupron trigger

RESULT: 10 eggs retrieved, 5 matured.

My RE suggested that since I'm high risk she wanted me to take letrozole almost everyday before the trigger and to resume it after the retrieval to keep the estrogen low. 
Also during stims: she wanted and kept my E2 level below <500.

Has anyone experienced with letrozole with results like this? I guess I'm a bit disappointed with the #'s overall and I wonder is it because of my high risk case protocol it reduced my eggs retrieval and maturity? Since the E2 was kept so low, <500.  I'm fortunate that I don't have cancer but yet I'm high risk for it.

We are both healthy, have been tested and nothing is wrong, and now I’m on clomid and seeing a fertility doctor. I finished my 2nd round and I have a feeling I might be getting my period very soon 😔. My question is: if IVF is one of our next alternatives (after IUI I’d hope) do we have to pay for every IVF round or do you pay once until it works? I live in Canada and IVF is nearly 20k!

Would it be 60k??? To me that is INSANE and heartbreaking. It is hard enough not being able to get pregnant despite having tried literally everything (I’ve taken every supplement possible, done every silly thing to improve my chances).

197,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, all,

This is my first standalone post in this forum, so I hope I'm following the guidelines correctly. I apologize in advance for the length. 

Background: I'm a relatively healthy 31yo female. My husband has had hypogonadism his entire life and cannot produce sperm, so we are using a donor (his brother). We have known about his condition throughout our entire relationship but only formally met with a very young RE last fall to begin this journey and learn about our options.

Since I am fortunate to have always had normal menstrual cycles and I am under 35, my RE suggested we start with a few (3-6) rounds of IUI. My husband and I both liked the idea of starting more ""naturally"" as we knew he was the infertile partner and we want to avoid having multiples. As part of routine testing, in December I had a BAF performed by a different RE in my clinic who counted 11 follicles (6 on one side, 5 on the other). He said this was on the low end of normal but I heard nothing further from my own RE. My Vitamin D was deficient (which has been a problem for me in the past) so I started supplementing in addition to taking a prenatal. My thyroid, lipids, etc. all came back in healthy ranges.

After meeting with genetic and fertility counselors over the winter, we asked my brother-in-law to be our sperm donor and he kindly agreed. At my clinic, the 6-month waiting period for donor sperm can be reduced to a 1-week wait for certain directed donors, so long as they have an exam by a urologist and routine semen testing for all donations made within a 7-day period. \[I'm probably forgetting some details here, but it's legal and we feel *very* lucky we have this option.\] In summary, this means if we fly my BIL in for a week-long visit, he can theoretically provide 3 samples (spaced a couple of days apart). Assuming they pass muster, a week or so later, they can be thawed for my use.

We were planning to fly my BIL here in March so that I could possibly have my first IUI in April. In February, I started following this forum more closely and read post after post about the low success rate of IUI, especially with frozen sperm and no medications. This prompted me to ask my RE about using clomid or another drug to up my chances of success. I also brought up the BAF result from 3 months prior which prompted my RE to have my AMH tested. On the same week that I found out our clinic was closing for COVID-19 (cancelling my brother-in-law's trip and first donation window), my RE called to let me know that my AMH was low at 0.68 ng/ml. She was very kind about it, but it obviously wasn't pleasant to learn. She didn't mention that it could be tied to my recent Vitamin D deficiency, so, thank you forum for lifting my spirits on that. She also said that AMH does not mean bad quality eggs or that I am running out fast of my reserve. She said it is one marker but that it's not the ""end-all-be-all"" that it once was thought to be. 

Even with this news, she still recommends we start IUI unmedicated to avoid having multiples, though she suggested I have a HSG during the same cycle I plan to start IUI. She also gave me a list of supplements to take (the same ones recommended in ""It Starts with the Egg""). She agreed to let me use clomid on my first IUI with monitoring, though, if that's the route I feel more comfortable with. She wasn't pressuring me one way or the other.

Given this information, **what would you do in my situation?** Start IUI unmedicated or start with clomid to increase success rate? 

I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but to say I hear my biological clock ticking is an understatement and the delays caused by COVID closing our clinic have only given me more anxiety. My BIL is finally scheduled to visit later this month, so I may be able to have my first IUI in July if his samples pass and are high enough quality. It's unclear how many vials we will be able to use from his visit, but we're hoping for at least 2. (He can only stay for a long weekend given his work schedule.) Once we run out of vials, we have to repeat the process. He can use a sperm bank in his state, but then we will have to wait 6 months for those samples to be cleared before we can use them. This is the route we plan to use long term, assuming we have a successful IUI.

At our first meeting, my RE explained the various risks of multiples with the different drugs and methods. If I recall correctly, there was about a 10% chance of twins with clomid. She also explained I would need to be monitored while taking it, and if there were a certain number of mature follicles present, they would cancel the IUI and adjust the dosage. I have also read on these forums that many successful pregnancies start as twins early on but quickly transition to singleton pregnancies. I personally feel that the risk is low enough that I would be willing to try IUI with clomid before making the more expensive and invasive jump to IVF. But I also recognize that having twins+ is dangerous and it is not how we envisioned starting our family (though whoever envisioned having infertility?). But given the high expense (money + time) of transporting our donor to our clinic and my new DOR status, I don't want to chance a cycle or two on my OPK and my clinic's timing. 

I welcome all feedback and appreciate your perspectives. I'm really struggling with this decision (my husband supports either option) and there's no one with whom I can personally discuss my situation who has this level of understanding.

<p>I know I&#39;m preaching to the choir here, but to say I hear my biological clock ticking is an understatement and the delays caused by COVID closing our clinic have only given me more anxiety. My BIL is finally scheduled to visit later this month, so I may be able to have my first IUI in July if his samples pass and are high enough quality. It&#39;s unclear how many vials we will be able to use from his visit, but we&#39;re hoping for at least 2. (He can only stay for a long weekend given his work schedule.) Once we run out of vials, we have to repeat the process. He can use a sperm bank in his state, but then we will have to wait 6 months for those samples to be cleared before we can use them. This is the route we plan to use long term, assuming we have a successful IUI.</p>

<p>At our first meeting, my RE explained the various risks of multiples with the different drugs and methods. If I recall correctly, there was about a 10% chance of twins with clomid. She also explained I would need to be monitored while taking it, and if there were a certain number of mature follicles present, they would cancel the IUI and adjust the dosage. I have also read on these forums that many successful pregnancies start as twins early on but quickly transition to singleton pregnancies. I personally feel that the risk is low enough that I would be willing to try IUI with clomid before making the more expensive and invasive jump to IVF. But I also recognize that having twins+ is dangerous and it is not how we envisioned starting our family (though whoever envisioned having infertility?). But given the high expense (money + time) of transporting our donor to our clinic and my new DOR status, I don&#39;t want to chance a cycle or two on my OPK and my clinic&#39;s timing. </p>

<p>I welcome all feedback and appreciate your perspectives. I&#39;m really struggling with this decision (my husband supports either option) and there&#39;s no one with whom I can personally discuss my situation who has this level of understanding. Thank you!</p>

Let me provide some context before I ask my questions:

1. We decided to do IVF ICSI because of issues with my husband and me. We are both in mid-to-late 30s.
2. Egg Retrieval 1: I took Gonal F 225, Menopur 225 and Letrozole (treatment for 11 days). We got 17 eggs out of which 9 were mature. We ended with 3 embryos which we froze.
3. Egg retrieval 2: I did a similar protocol with Gonal F 225 (increased to 300 for last 3 days), Menopur 225 (increased to 300 for last 3 days) and Letrozole (treatment for 13 days). We got 14 eggs out of which 9 were mature. We froze 6 embryos.
4. After pausing for 2 months due to COVID, we did chromosomal testing and 2 out of 9 tested positive. I think it's interesting and weird that all of the embryos ended up being male. 
5. We implanted both embryos (the doctor did explain that they were both growing slower)
6. I got pregnant with low beta HCG in my first test, but the numbers grew quickly so we were more confident: 8dp5dt - 19.14; 10dp5dt - 68.12 and 12dp5dt - 115.80.
7. I noticed some spotting and cramping so I did another beta hcg test. The level was quite low at 17dp5dt - 159.6.
8. I went to see the doctor and he checked to make sure it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy, which it isn't. He then warned me that I'm likely having an early miscarriage. When we asked why this could be happening, he mentioned that the embryos might have slow mitochondria, but didn't really explain what that means beyond ""it's like having a slow battery"".
9. It's been a few days now and it's clearly an early miscarriage (though I will do another beta hcg test tomorrow and follow-up with the doctor). It's obviously really upsetting to feel so close and yet be so far from having a baby. Even though I read up on miscarriages, I'm also shocked at how painful it is, how long it's lasting (already been a few days) and how much stuff is coming out of me (I told my husband that I'll be a few pounds lighter by the time this is done).   

But I have so many questions...What do I do now? I know I want to try again, but should I start an egg retrieval cycle with my next period or should I wait a few cycles?  I'm feeling motivated like I should just get on with it, but my husband thinks we should take some time to regroup and let my body rest. What did you do and why after a miscarriage? What should I do to make sure my miscarriage is ""done""? How long did it take you before getting your period? Have you heard about slow mitochondria? Do you think changing my protocol will help for the next round? I've been reading about taking HGH (which I don't know much about yet) and trying to improve my egg quality, but would love to read other ideas. Also, have you ever heard of all the embryos being male (or female)?

213,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello everyone! I posted this is r/queerception and it was suggested that I try this group instead :)

I'm a 27yo lesbian TTC using frozen donor sperm (my wife is 32yo). I have no known fertility issues and a very high AMH. However, we unsuccessfully attempted 6 rounds of IUI using the same donor each time, so we have now decided to move to IVF with a different frozen donor as the next step.

I started BC on 5/15. Went in for my first ultrasound on 5/28 which showed one stubborn follicle that was large (20mm), so they had me continue taking the pill. Went in for another ultrasound on 6/5 which showed that the follicle got even bigger (25mm) despite the BC. My doc said this one follicle will sabotage my entire cycle if we proceed, so I'm now forced to choose between continuing on BC for an unknown amount of time (could be weeks) or having a last minute ""cyst aspiration"" this Monday on 6/8. I haven't found much info on this, so I would love people's thoughts! Sounds like it's essentially the same procedure as an egg retrieval, but it's aspirating one follicle instead of multiple.

Another question I have is if others using frozen donor sperm have needed ICSI? From what I've read, that's typically only necessary for sperm with low counts, poor motility, etc. My clinic said I basically have to if I'm using frozen sperm... assuming this is relatively common? It's an additional $1610, so we wanted to make sure it was a major necessity considering the price. Although I know that's not much given the total cost of IVF, and any increased chance is ideal!

Last question: Because of my high AMH, shape/BMI and age, my doc has already said we will not be doing a fresh IVF cycle because she is convinced I will be pretty miserable, I'm relatively high risk for OHSS and that I would potentially need fluid tapped off of my abdomen if we were to go that route. She is very optimistic about how high of an egg yield I will have (although we have not started stim meds or anything) and that my best bet is to wait for a frozen cycle. She had mentioned that frozen cycles have slightly higher success rates nowadays, which has me hopeful. Just curious what experience anyone has with waiting a cycle after the retrieval and starting with FET?

Backstory: husband and I had secondary fertility issues (repeat losses). TW: finally had recent success. The journey was really hard but I know many have it so much worse. 

My younger sister (early 30s) just got engaged. Her wedding was postponed by a year because of covid19, and she is absolutely freaking out about her fertility as this means a delay in trying to conceive (although this paranoia started months ago, before the pandemic/postponement). 

I have tried to be sympathetic - I guess my losses affected her more than I realized? - but I'm losing my patience. She talks about her \*potential\* infertility nonstop (almost every phone conversation with me) and I find myself growing more and more frustrated with her. She has no reason (besides having a sister that struggled) to think she will have trouble conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term. I mean, neither did I, but I guess my attitude is why be anxious about a problem you don't yet know you have? Even in my most challenging moments during this  process, I did my best not to let it consume every conversation - and I was actually going through it!

I've tried telling her all this and she yeses me, and then...brings it up again a week later. Her poor fiance is so exhausted by her fears that he told her to freeze her eggs if she's that worried about her fertility, which I don't find helpful though I'm sympathetic with his frustration.

237,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"It's well known that I like data and since there were questions about the AM/PM thread distinction I did another data analysis.  Unfortunately the data has to be mined manually so this is only for the past month.

(1) Overall # of comments

1. The Treatment threads combined saw a total of 5,859 comments and an average of 195.3 per day.
2. The Chat threads combined saw a total of 3,933 comments and an average of 131.1 per day.
3. For every 1 comment in the Treatment threads there are 0.74 in the Chat threads.

(2) Splitting the comments based on AM/PM

1. The PM threads combined saw a total of 5,445 comments (Avg: 182).
2. The AM threads combined saw a total of 4,347 comments (Avg: 145).
3. On average the difference between AM combined threads and PM combined threads is 36.6 more comments in the PM threads.

(3) Here's where it gets interesting... Deltas and Skew *(Edit I had an error in one of my formulas!!  Updated my comments.)*

1. The Treatment threads skews to the PM.  The delta is on average 16.1 more comments in Treatment PM.  As noted above, the Treatment threads see more comments overall though (1.1).
2. The Chat threads skews to the PM.  The delta is on average 20.5 more comments in the Chat PM.  As noted above, the Chat threads see less comments overall though (1.2).
3. The skew\* for Treatment is an average of 0.05 to PM, but the skew to Chat is an average of 0.12 to PM.
4. This means the Chat threads skew more heavily to the PM, and the Treatment thread skews less heavily to the PM.
5. If you count threads as just ""were there more in AM or PM?""  The Treatment threads sees 62% ""PM  days"" and the Chat thread sees 68% ""PM days""

\*Skew is the days delta (difference between AM/PM) divided by the total number of comments for the day.  My intent was to consider not just the total variance, but the variance in relation to the overall volume.  9 more comments in one thread on a day that saw 10 comments total is significant (0.9).  9 more comments in one thread on a day that saw 1000 comments total is not significant (0.009).

(4) Other trends and tidbits...

* Treatment sees a distinct Mon-Fri trend.  The lowest volume week days are Sat/Sun (pretty even) and then Thursday which is only slightly lower than the rest of the week.  Tuesday is the peak day of the week on average.
* The Saturday Treatment thread skews to the AM dramatically compared to the rest of the week.
* Chat has a less distinct trend.  The lowest volume week days are Sun, Fri, and Sat which are all pretty even.  The peak day of the week on average is Thursday.
* Overall the participation in all threads is increasing over the last month and the most recent 7 days saw an 86% increase over the first 7 days (not entirely surprising).

If you like tables, graphs, and lots of colors, there is a screenshot of my sheet [here](https://imgur.com/a/J1gFDDY).

Summary:

My original analysis that there were skewing different is wrong!  I actually love this!  This is why I like data.  They both skew to the PM so I need to adjust the times (that part is not a science).

We still have a challenge on whether to split up another time chunk (in addition to AM/PM) which I commented below.  We have historically looked to split up threads that gather more than 200 comments.  It's not scientific, just a rough guidelines when threads start to become unwieldy.  The treatment thread is hitting that ceiling.

I'm open to thoughts or feedback on the data, but I can't promise that it will result in a dramatic change to the current routine with out further discussion among the mods.

*Edited: trying to fix markup*

*Edited2: The mods are talking about options to address the feedback received and what we can determine from the data.  Those conversations will take time, and may still not result in change.

Unfortunately the data has to be mined manually so this is only for the past month.</p>

<p>(1) Overall # of comments</p>

<ol>
<li>The Treatment threads combined saw a total of 5,859 comments and an average of 195.3 per day.</li>
<li>The Chat threads combined saw a total of 3,933 comments and an average of 131.1 per day.</li>
<li>For every 1 comment in the Treatment threads there are 0.74 in the Chat threads.</li>
</ol>

<p>(2) Splitting the comments based on AM/PM</p>

<ol>
<li>The PM threads combined saw a total of 5,445 comments (Avg: 182).</li>
<li>The AM threads combined saw a total of 4,347 comments (Avg: 145).</li>
<li>On average the difference between AM combined threads and PM combined threads is 36.6 more comments in the PM threads.</li>
</ol>

<p>(3) Here&#39;s where it gets interesting... Deltas and Skew <em>(Edit I had an error in one of my formulas!!  Updated my comments.)</em></p>

<ol>
<li>The Treatment threads skews to the PM.  The delta is on average 16.1 more comments in Treatment PM.  As noted above, the Treatment threads see more comments overall though (1.1).</li>
<li>The Chat threads skews to the PM.  The delta is on average 20.5 more comments in the Chat PM.  As noted above, the Chat threads see less comments overall though (1.2).</li>
<li>The skew* for Treatment is an average of 0.05 to PM, but the skew to Chat is an average of 0.12 to PM.</li>
<li>This means the Chat threads skew more heavily to the PM, and the Treatment thread skews less heavily to the PM.</li>
<li>If you count threads as just &quot;were there more in AM or PM?&quot;  The Treatment threads sees 62% &quot;PM  days&quot; and the Chat thread sees 68% &quot;PM days&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>*Skew is the days delta (difference between AM/PM) divided by the total number of comments for the day.  My intent was to consider not just the total variance, but the variance in relation to the overall volume.  9 more comments in one thread on a day that saw 10 comments total is significant (0.9).  9 more comments in one thread on a day that saw 1000 comments total is not significant (0.009).</p>

<p>(4) Other trends and tidbits...</p>

<ul>
<li>Treatment sees a distinct Mon-Fri trend.  The lowest volume week days are Sat/Sun (pretty even) and then Thursday which is only slightly lower than the rest of the week.  Tuesday is the peak day of the week on average.</li>
<li>The Saturday Treatment thread skews to the AM dramatically compared to the rest of the week.</li>
<li>Chat has a less distinct trend.  The lowest volume week days are Sun, Fri, and Sat which are all pretty even.  The peak day of the week on average is Thursday.</li>
<li>Overall the participation in all threads is increasing over the last month and the most recent 7 days saw an 86% increase over the first 7 days (not entirely surprising).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you like tables, graphs, and lots of colors, there is a screenshot of my sheet <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/J1gFDDY"">here</a>.</p>

I am a black woman who has been an infertility patient since 2013. I’ve had 3 different REs and 1 NaPro GYN. I’ve had two cycles of timed intercourse, 3 IUIs, 4 ICSI cycles and 4 FETs. Finally, I’ve an 1 ectopic pregnancy, 2 chemical pregnancies, 2 miscarriages, a missed miscarriage that resulted in a D&C, and most painful of all, the birth and death of my micropreemie son due to cervical insuffiency. I have a clean RPL panel and my only diagnosis (beyond the recent IC and even more recent Ashermans Syndrome because my sons placenta wouldn’t detach) is endometriosis.

I strongly believe that a cornerstone of all of this failure is racism. I’ll never forget one IUI I had was two hours late because a woman and her 4 kids came in after me, but was called back before me. Before anyone asks, no she did not have an appointment because I heard them clearly tell her she was at the wrong branch, but they took her back anyways. Or the time when I miscarried my PGS normal embryo right after seeing the heartbeat, and my RE came in shrieking “what did you do?!” The worst case of all of course was my baby boy. I self referred to a high risk clinic, knowing that with my extensive loss and infertility history, things were going to be an uphill battle. My MFM actively saw my cervix change and did NOTHING, even when Iisted off and begged for several common interventions for IC (cerclage, 17p, progesterone suppositories). She smirked at me and told me to come back in 2 weeks, my son was born less than a week later. 

So many of the experiences I have suffered through are backed up by evidence and are experienced by other black women. For instance, on average, [black women tend to have their AMH decline faster than their nonblack counterparts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3857838/). The RE who told me I was young and had time vastly overestimated the time I had; since I’ve started treatments my AMH is less than half the value it was when I did my first cycle of IVF in 2016. Or IC, it’s [well documented](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301211517305481) that black women are at an increased risk for incompetent cervix but my perinatologist didn’t think to explore the adjusted average of occurrence amongst black pregnant women, instead she went with the overall average. Lastly, [black women have the lowest rates of ART success and the highest rates of miscarriage and preterm birth when they do conceive](https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12958-017-0262-5). Even amongst fertile black women, the [maternal and infant mortality rate disparity is an acknowledged health epidemic in the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html).

Has any other patients of color experienced biases or disparities in treatment due to race/ethnicity?

This is mentioned in a bunch of places, but we are seeing an influx of users and more confusion than usual.  **We have two daily threads: treatment and chat**.

We love all of you and we know that holding these sub-paces can be a little bit tricky to navigate, but we are a very large and multi-faceted group of people on our own unique journeys.  The sub-spaces allow you to find others that are in the same mental space as you with similar needs and expectations while protecting those that are not in the same mental space, and have different needs at the moment.  We tremendously appreciate when folks receive guiding feedback without the assumption of attack or malice.

**The chat thread is intended for things that are NOT related to treatment**.  Infertility is not forbidden in this thread, but the space is intended to not be directly about treatment, diagnosis, etc.  We carve out this space because many members have made enduring friendships here, but we know not everyone is in the same mental space at any given time.  The chat is intended to be a ""treatment free zone"" for folks to bond and discuss things not related to treatment.  Are you coping with your TWW or COVID wait by taking up a new craft (including infertility cross stitch or coloring)?  Are you overwhelmed with current events and the idea of bringing a child in to it?  Did your idiotic coworker manage to mention their kids YET AGAIN during your weekly team meeting?  Are you moving and trying to decide if you should splurge on that extra bedroom?  Are you frustrated that all the corporate conversations on how to cope during quarantine are focused on ""how to balance your kids and work?"" (It can't be just me)

<p>This is mentioned in a bunch of places, but we are seeing an influx of users and more confusion than usual.  <strong>We have two daily threads: treatment and chat</strong>.</p>

<p>We love all of you and we know that holding these sub-paces can be a little bit tricky to navigate, but we are a very large and multi-faceted group of people on our own unique journeys.  The sub-spaces allow you to find others that are in the same mental space as you with similar needs and expectations while protecting those that are not in the same mental space, and have different needs at the moment.  We tremendously appreciate when folks receive guiding feedback without the assumption of attack or malice.</p>

<p><strong>The chat thread is intended for things that are NOT related to treatment</strong>.  Infertility is not forbidden in this thread, but the space is intended to not be directly about treatment, diagnosis, etc.  We carve out this space because many members have made enduring friendships here, but we know not everyone is in the same mental space at any given time.  The chat is intended to be a &quot;treatment free zone&quot; for folks to bond and discuss things not related to treatment.  Are you coping with your TWW or COVID wait by taking up a new craft (including infertility cross stitch or coloring)?  Are you overwhelmed with current events and the idea of bringing a child in to it?  Did your idiotic coworker manage to mention their kids YET AGAIN during your weekly team meeting?  Are you moving and trying to decide if you should splurge on that extra bedroom?  Are you frustrated that all the corporate conversations on how to cope during quarantine are focused on &quot;how to balance your kids and work?&quot; (It can&#39;t be just me)</p>
