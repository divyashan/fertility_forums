Those of you who did or didn't get it, do you regret your decision? If you feel comfortable do you also mind sharing what you paid for the plan and how much your costs still were outside of the plan?

My gut reaction is to accept the plan for 2 cycles with unlimited FET, no refund, for ~20k. This would pay for itself if we had to do 3 FET on the first cycle. It gives me peace of mind to know we would have two full cycles to get results. In order to get the 50% refund it would be an additional 3k.

<p>Any other useful advise would be greatly appreciated. This whole process has been soul-crushing to say the least, and we’re trying our hardest to keep our heads up.</p>

We've been trying for over a year and it's becoming clear that two cones that I had in the past left bad scars on my cervix: so, no CM, narrow entrance to my uterus and probably a complicated pregnancy in case it ever happens. In February I lost my dad: I spent six months in the hospital with him, watching him going from complication to complication and eventually being defeated. This left me not only grieving, but terrified by medical procedures. Right after his death I continued trying to conceive naturally: I really craved for life, and I wasn't thinking too much. But after my diagnosis two weeks ago everything changed. Now I'm facing a very medicalized journey: shots, catheters, egg retrievals, cerclage, all the possible issues related to pregnancy and delivery. I'm scared of getting pregnant and of not getting pregnant. I'm 35, if I stop the process now I will have even lower chances in the future. Is it kind of normal to be this terrified? At the moment I feel completely paralyzed by my anxiety. Help?

32,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Sorry for the stand-alone post, but this felt too long to put in the daily chat threads.  I just need to vent and lay out my thoughts and feelings a bit.

My husband and I had an argument last night about what our next steps would be if IVF doesn’t work. We haven’t made a decision about how many cycles we would be willing to do.  Our second cycle will start after my next period in July. I think we would try at least one more ER if that cycle is also a bust. So, we’re still a ways off from having to figure out what would be our next steps, but I figured we should at least discuss what options would even be on the table.

My husband’s preference would be to ask my sister if she would be an egg donor.  He prefers this because then we could still have a child who is biologically related to both of us.  I am reluctant to do this for many reasons.  

First of all, we can’t even be sure that the issue is my eggs.  Per my RE, I likely have “borderline ovarian reserve”, because my FSH is on the high end of normal for my age (9.3 on CD 2), though my AMH (3.8) and AFC (consistently >14) are reassuring.  We probably wouldn’t put a ton of stock in my FSH with the other studies being normal, but in my first cycle I needed the max doses of stims to get the follicles to grow.  I ended up getting 21 eggs, but they were poor quality and despite having 13 fertilized, there was a lot of early fragmentation and only one made it to blast, and the quality was poor (3CB-).  My RE does not think that poor egg quality is confirmed by this, because we had to make such a large increase in the doses (Follistim 150–>450; Menopur 75–>150) during the cycle that she thinks it could have affected the egg quality.  We will start at the high doses for the next cycle and we are also changing the protocol from antagonist to agonist in the next cycle. She is optimistic that we will have better luck with that.


My husband has had two normal SAs.  Counts were 23.5 x10^6 and 26.5 x10^6 and motility was 60% both times.  Morphology was 7% in the first one an 5% in the second.  The rest of the workup has been unremarkable.  Diagnostic lap found no endo.  HSG and sonohysterogram were both normal.

So, the only thing we have to go on is my “borderline ovarian reserve” and one cycle with poor egg quality that isn’t necessarily diagnostic, given how much troubleshooting we had to do in the cycle.  Without even knowing if it’s really my eggs that are the problem, I don’t know if an egg donor would be the automatic next step.

In addition to that, I don’t even know if I’m comfortable using an egg donor.  I definitely don’t want a donor who is not related to me, because I just don’t think I can handle the emotional impact of having a child who looks like my husband, but doesn’t look like me.  Using my sister’s eggs would at least result in a baby who is related to (and looks like) both of us, but I still don’t know if I can mentally/emotionally handle knowing that I am biologically the child’s aunt, instead of the biological mother. M

To add on even more to that, I also haven’t even broached the idea with my sister, so I don’t know if she would be comfortable with it anyway.

Another options would of course be sperm donation (if we end up having reason to think that his sperm is the issue), but I don’t think I could be comfortable with that for the same reason I don’t think I could do an egg donation from a person not related to me (my husband doesn’t have any brothers).

Then there is adoption.  I honestly don’t know if that would even be possible, because I have a long history of depression and anxiety, and I had two short inpatient psych stays when I was a teenager for suicide ideation (those instances were largely fueled by a sexual assault).  My depression and anxiety have been mostly controlled since then (though infertility has led me to start seeing a therapist regularly again), but from what I’ve read, it seems like any inpatient psych stay will probably disqualify me.

Even if I could be a candidate for adoption, my husband doesn’t feel like he could handle the stress that comes with it.  The money, the waiting, the hoping/praying that we’re picked, the anxiety that the birth parents will change their minds at the last second, etc.  

Then there are the issues that come up if we adopt a child of a different race.  We’re white.  I would not want to have any preference on race if we adopt, and I know that if we did want to adopt a white baby, it would take a lot longer.  My husband is reluctant to adopt a child of a different race.  He is not at all biased in terms of who he wants to be his child, but he is worried about how society (particularly in the south) would react to us having a child who is a different race than us.  For example, I have friends who are white and their daughter is black; they once had the police called on them because they were carrying their daughter out of a store while she was throwing a tantrum, and bystanders thought that they were kidnapping her. While I don’t want to downplay or discount the way our family would be treated if we had children who were a different race than us, I also feel like the pain from that can’t possibly be worse than remaining childfree-not-by-choice.  Still, my husband is reluctant to go down that route.

I wish someone would have told me this years ago, but I’ve come to it on my own anyway. So for those of you that this applies to, now or in the future, you’re not alone. Here you go: 

This week is infertility week. Most of the posts you will see this week are about the pain infertile individuals and couples experience. Please read these posts and articles carefully and learn how to not say insensitive things to your friends and loved ones experiencing infertility. 

Many of the posts will talk about infertility from the perspective of those who have experienced some type of “happy ending” whether through lifestyle changes, infertility treatments, or adoption. Often times you’ll hear these individuals say they would tell their younger selves not to give up. 

Although I respect everyone’s experiences and desires, I’m breaking my silence to tell a different narrative and to offer some hard-won advice and perspective for anyone out there that may be experiencing infertility: 

You can “give up.”

In fact, you may want to seriously consider GIVING THE FUCK UP. 

You don’t have to make huge sacrifices in the areas of physical health, mental health, lifestyle, sex life, relationship quality, and/or finances, especially when you may be facing odds of success that range from 20-50% (my personal odds for infertility and adoption included in this estimate). I can’t think of a single other circumstance in which people find themselves so compelled to make such astronomical sacrifices in the face of such terrible odds. 

While learning to live without the children you dreamed of is an indescribable loss, you don’t actually have to have children in order to have a happy and fulfilling life.

Believe me, I know. 

It’s not selfish to “give up.” 

If you choose to “give up,” you are not disrespecting anyone else’s choice. 

Remember, when you say no to something important, you’re saying yes to something even more important. 

One last note: people change all the time. I’m choosing to “give up” right now. It doesn’t mean I will continue to feel this way in the future.

Hello all! I wanted to get some perspective from people who maybe have been through this.

Brief history: 3 early losses in a 7 month period, one of which was confirmed ectopic (treated with methotrexate). All basic fertility tests now done. HSG was excruciating and showed a blocked right tube which is where the ectopic was.

I have been told my options are a laparoscopy to do chromopertubation and attempt to clear the tube if possible, or straight to IVF. I had thought I would definitely go for the lap, but now I think straight to IVF after my doctor said:

- may not be able to unblock the tube

- you could continue to try naturally with one tube but you have 3 losses in 18 months since you started trying, if you go another 6 months without a successful pregnancy then you're v v unlikely to conceive naturally

- even if the tube is unblocked, it could close up again

- continuing to try naturally has a v high risk of ectopic (potentially the other two losses could have been ectopic too - we don't know)

I really don't want to go through another ectopic. I understand there's still a risk with IVF but it sounds like much lower than my risk of continuing to try naturally, with or without laparoscopy. He said it doesn't look like hydrosalpinx so removal isn't necessary.

Does straight to IVF sound like the best choice? Is there anything else important a lap could tell me? I'm 33 if that makes a difference.

If you would like to check my intro story, here is the link to my original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bmkhom/cornual_ectopic_rupture_on_tubeless_side_anyone/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share.

Otherwise I'll keep this short-ish. I have 1 month before my next appt. with my ob/gyn. The purpose of this appt. is to decide what to do next and when. It's been 8 months since my cornual ectopic rupture, and 6 months since my last follow up where they found more polyps in my uterine lining via ultrasound.
In my mind, the next step would be surgery to remove the polyps, then waiting a cycle, then either trying on our own for a few months or going right to IUI (at this time, being 1 year after my rupture).
I want to be as prepared as possible with questions for my doctor and I just don't know where to start. (Such as, what are the chances of this happening again? Is there anything I can do to decrease those chances? Does IUI affect those chances vs us conceiving on our own? Is there a such thing as uterine mesh and is it something that I should consider given how fragile my uterus is now post-op?) I started this journey very naive with a doctor that did not inform me of things I should've been informed of.

Isn’t totally irritating and unbelievable, but last night I started bleeding. Not a proper period as I don’t get those due to PCOS. I wasn’t expecting a bleed at all because I had one 2 weeks ago, but PCOS is unpredictable!! 

So is it totally acceptable for me to go for a vaginal ultrasound whilst bleeding or will they think I’m gross and should’ve rearranged? I can’t rearrange now as the time is too short.

I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll just have to file this under &quot;every cycle is different after a loss&quot;, but I&#39;m curious if this has happened to anyone else before.</p>

Been trying for over two years for a baby. Just over a year ago, I saw a nurse midwife to see if there's anything that can be done to help. They ran some tests and referred my husband to an andrology clinic. My tests were inconclusive, and his VA primary care doctor didn't know how to read the andrology results, so we have no idea about his fertility at the moment.

The nurse midwife basically told me that normally they'd start clomid treatment for me, but because I have a 39 BMI, they won't help me. It's my understanding that they don't want to be held liable for potential complications that arise from an obese pregnancy.

Shouldn't that be my decision, what risks I'm willing to take? Should I get a second opinion, or are all doctors going to refuse to help us because of my weight? I'm 32 years old, 240 lbs, 5'6"". Been overweight/obese my entire life, but I'm healthy in every other aspect. I eat healthy and I'm active. I'm not putting on weight, so I only eat as much as I burn. My mom was the same her whole life and she had trouble getting pregnant with her first, but her doc gave her clomid. She had zero complications (unless you count that both her babies were born with the umbilical cord around the neck, but we both survived).

**For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.**  Any concerns about an uncomfirmed or potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

You can post the outcome of your cycle here, positive or negative.  Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need. This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive result. Discussions of positive beta and/or HPT results, beta hell, beta limbo, or very early pregnancy concerns are to take place in this thread.   Beta and HPT results are allowed, however do not post images of tests. An appropriate place to share photos of tests is /r/TFABlineporn.

* Infertility includes:  primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** 

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

I know that it isn't that much time, but we did all the testing and found out everything is normal except I have a unicornuate uterus. Still my RE says this doesn't explain why I can't get pregnant, it just brings up concerns about staying pregnant if it ever happens. He also scared the crap out of me by saying ectopic pregnancy is a serious concern so if I ever do get a positive I should make an appointment right away so they can check things out. He said assume ectopic until proven otherwise.

Overall I've lost a lot of hope. I don't know if I can get pregnant. If I do get a positive I can't be excited because the appropriate response is supposed to be caution and concern. If I get past the ectopic thing, my uterus is small so I'm not out of the woods until very late stages of the pregnancy. I've stopped fantasizing about positives because they make me fearful. I've stopped fantasizing about pregnancy and baby showers, because a live birth is less likely and I need to be cautious. 

The desired result seems so far away, so unattainable, and the only way to get there is down this dark path of fear and worry and waiting and bated breath. Honestly I've stopped hoping, because all the steps to get there are not marked with milestones for excitement or joy. I didn't even feel jealousy when my friend had her baby last week. I was just like, oh good for you. 

Maybe my brain is just protecting itself, but I miss being able to be excited about the possibilities even though that came with some sadness too. Now I just feel detached.

Still my RE says this doesn&#39;t explain why I can&#39;t get pregnant, it just brings up concerns about staying pregnant if it ever happens. He also scared the crap out of me by saying ectopic pregnancy is a serious concern so if I ever do get a positive I should make an appointment right away so they can check things out. He said assume ectopic until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;ve lost a lot of hope. I don&#39;t know if I can get pregnant. If I do get a positive I can&#39;t be excited because the appropriate response is supposed to be caution and concern. If I get past the ectopic thing, my uterus is small so I&#39;m not out of the woods until very late stages of the pregnancy. I&#39;ve stopped fantasizing about positives because they make me fearful. I&#39;ve stopped fantasizing about pregnancy and baby showers, because a live birth is less likely and I need to be cautious. </p>

<p>The desired result seems so far away, so unattainable, and the only way to get there is down this dark path of fear and worry and waiting and bated breath. Honestly I&#39;ve stopped hoping, because all the steps to get there are not marked with milestones for excitement or joy. I didn&#39;t even feel jealousy when my friend had her baby last week. I was just like, oh good for you. </p>

<p>Maybe my brain is just protecting itself, but I miss being able to be excited about the possibilities even though that came with some sadness too. Now I just feel detached. Has anyone gone through this and been able to get back to hope?</p>

I know these kind of stories are probably a dime a dozen here, but I don’t know anyone who is needing to pursue IF treatment, there are 37 yr olds getting pregnant easily all around me, no one can relate, and my social life needs life support as it were.

My SO and I have been trying to conceive for about 2.5 years now. I no longer go out, drink alcohol or even coffee.  I gave up a lifetime of vegetarianism to follow a strict AIP paleo diet, thinking a lack of animal protein was somehow the key to what was wrong with me. So I basically don’t eat out or even eat food that other people prepare.. where I’m going with this is that when you’re not eating or drinking what everyone else is, the few social outlets I have access to in my zen-like existence is QT with my closest friends and family, many of whom are not even privy to what we are going through.

One of my best friends since childhood announced to me recently that she was pregnant in the most shitty and insensitive way. She told me while we were standing around at a fucking parade, surrounded by our closest friends and family. This also happened to be two days after our first IUI. I tried to act happy for her, but it was like she kicked me in the gut. She knew about my struggle, had seen me cry over it, seen all the ways I’ve changed because of it, and yet she thought it was a good idea to casually tell me her good news while standing next to her partner in the middle of a crowd, on what up to that point had been a pretty great day. 

It was especially gut wrenching because although I’ve tried to confide in her about my infertility over these years, she has not been very understanding or supportive. I can remember the look on her face when I told her the first time, about 9 or 10 months in, that we were trying but I was anxious that nothing was happening, and rather than smiling or acting excited for me/us, her face just fell and she said “really??” And then proceeded to talk about how her and her SO (of mere months) were already talking about having kids. Ok. From there on out it seemed that any time she would ask me ‘how everything was going’, she would use it as an opportunity to tell me their impending plans to start trying themselves. She one time told me the names they had already picked out for a possible boy or girl (barf) while she still had an IUD. It almost felt like it was a competition to her. This made me so uncomfortable that I decidedly stopped telling her details of all I was doing. It became clear that she was not really rooting for me, and made me feel like I was crazy and obsessive for giving up gluten or getting acupuncture.

When she told me last fall that she had her IUD taken out because she was ‘worried about copper toxicity’ I kinda knew what was really going on. She later told me, before going on a short trip, that they pulled out the last time they had sex because she ‘didn’t want to worry about being pregnant’ on the trip. I said, well do you know when you ovulated? And she just kinda stared at me blankly and said no. 

I never would wish infertility upon another person, but in some way I was a little bit comforted by the idea that she possibly would take a while to conceive...like me. We are the same exact age (37), became vegetarians together at the age of 11 (so maybe she also is malnourished 🤷🏼‍♀️), she’s been a smoker her whole life, she takes medication for migraine headaches.. I started imagining myself giving her pointers on charting, her asking me endless questions that I had all the answers to, she would start her own crazy routine and finally ‘get’ all the reasons we do what we do, and we would bond over this.

But nope. She just “got an app” she said.  After a couple months she got an app that “told her when she was ovulating” and she just got lucky. I immediately blurted out “well those apps never work”, but she just smiled smugly as if to say ‘yes they do, it worked for me so I don’t know why it wouldn’t work for anyone else’.. she never took her temp, or read TCOYF cover to cover, used up 100 opks, or spent endless hours researching FSH, TSH, LH etc. Shes known her father to be about as long as we’ve been trying. it’s ridiculous, and I’m furious. 

This all happened a month ago, I haven’t seen or spoken to her since. She knows that I’m upset, she texted me later that day to say she had been nervous about telling me.. I’m convinced that she did it that way to protect herself from having to have a difficult conversation with me me one on one. I am like haunted by that day. I keep reimagining it in my head, and it ends with me slapping her or her dude’s dumb face. The thought of seeing her or talking to her or seeing her once she’s showing is extremely triggering to me and I’m not sure how to move on from this. I avoid walking by her house when I go for walks (yeah she lives like a block away too). I’ve avoided, and plan to avoid, group get togethers with our close knit group of friends cause I know it’s going to be all pregnancy talk and excitement. It’s just so frustrating cause she’s there, I’m not, and she’s probably soliciting sympathy from everyone else over how I’m handling the situation. I really haven’t opened up much to everyone about my infertility, but I’m sure they know now, secondhand, and I’m sure they will say I’m ‘overreacting’, and should ‘just be happy’ for my friend.

Am I overreacting tho? I want to just be happy for my friend but the whole thing feels so fucking rotten. She texted me today for the first time and I decided to write this instead of answer her.. I think I’m going to just tell her I need some more time away from her. I know if I take time to ‘catch up’ with her all she’s gonna want to do is talk about her pregnancy. I just can’t. I know there’s going to be a baby shower and everything and I need to figure out a plan to navigate this. If circumstances were different I would probably be the one planning it..this is just not how I imagined this stage of our lives looking like.

Oh and ps our IUI didn’t work. The day I found out it didn’t work was also the day my niece was born. It also happened to be the day I found this page. I actually declined a facetime call from my SIL while I was engrossed in perusing other people’s stories. I didn’t call them back to congratulate them for two days. It seems like other people’s joy always coincides perfectly with my bad news, and I’m always running away from social events and hiding my sorrow. 

I feel like people think I’m a bitch. I feel like I’ve kind of become a bitch. I don’t want to push people out of my life. I know I need to focus on my own sanity and well being as I approach our next round of treatment, but I’m afraid that looks like me by myself in my backyard, in silence, turning into a hermit.",t2_3vzhebos,False,,0,False,How are you doing at maintaining relationships with the ignorant fertiles in your life?,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_by6fk6,False,dark,0.86,,public,46,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,46,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1560016553.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>TW: easily pregnant people.</p>

Wouldn&#39;t both parties need to meet with a psych as well? She knows nothing about IVF or this stuff so he said I could give her any advice. I don&#39;t know anything about own egg surrogacy though, anyone here have some words of warning or helpful advice I could offer?</p>

I recently have been trying to be more open and talk about my infertility with close friends and family which has been helping me a lot. They do try to understand and be supportive but at the same time, they just don't understand and can't relate. Infertility and problems with conceiving is so much more common than you think - but it seems like no one talks about it! No one talks about the struggle to get pregnant. My husband and I decided about four years ago that we wanted to start trying - it was more of a ""when it happens it happens but we aren't trying to prevent it"". A little over a year into that, we were still with no luck. I started going to my OBGYN for testing and everything continued to come back positive/neutral/natural/good/all the terms you want to hear. After they did a few tests on my end, my husband got did the sperm analysis - again came back normal/positive. That was probably the most frustrating part - being diagnosed with the term ""unexplained infertility"". We then did the HSG procedure with iodine to check for blocked Fallopian tubes. HSG test came back normal, my Fallopian tubes weren't the problem. The doctor did though let me know that I have an abnormal uterus and told me that it won't affect trying to get pregnant but can affect the baby going to full term. So there's that in the back of my head now. If there was something specifically wrong with either him or I - we would at least know what the problem was. I did some of the basic tests to start - clomid while having intercourse the all natural way. Three cycles in a row, uping the dose of clomid and all three failed. That is when I started going to CNY Fertility. We started with IUI. The first cycle was 2.5MG letrozole and I went in twice a week for blood work and ultrasounds. The follicles in my ovaries weren't getting big enough (to the size they needed to be). They uped my dosage to 5mg and I went back the following week. Blood work showed I missed my ovulating point and we weren't able to actually do the IUI procedure. First cycle was a wash. (I do Fertility Yoga every saturday morning which is really nice - look into it if you haven't already, very helpful with stress). The last couple cycles that I have done with IUI, have been at 7.5mg letrozole daily and I am currently in the middle of a cycle right now. I went in on Wednesday for my usual blood work and ultrasound and my follicles were ""at perfect size"" WOOT WOOT I was glowing! Any kind of positive news and I take that as a win! Ya no, it's the little things :). She wanted me schedule the IUI right away and have me come in the next day (thursday) to do the procedure. BAM I'm DOWN! After I got home I had to do the trigger shot and then just relaxed that night. My husband went in at 7:30am and gave his sample. I went in a 9am and his sperm was washed and ready to go! Our nurse Anna was hilarious. Talking my husband up, ""you better tell him, he killed it! His sample was 71 million and after washing, we are able to use 68 million!""

However, this is a rare opportunity to have the chance for a private adoption. But 6 weeks is so soon! And what if we are finally successful with our own transfer? Soooo confused. Any thoughts?

Edit: found out some more information (through the coworker): girl has had a troubled past, convicted of selling drugs and currently in jail/psych center.

I'm 34. Two months ago, my RE performed surgery to remove one of my ovaries and a fallopian tube that turned out to be cancerous. I've apparently been harboring this rare form of slow-growing ovarian cancer my entire life and the massive amounts of hormones it secreted were responsible for 20 years of anovulatory PCOS and a 10-year infertility struggle. With the tumor removed, my hormone levels are normal, my one remaining ovary is no longer showing any sign of being polycystic, and my RE tells me he thinks I can get pregnant naturally.

But, I was having all the symptoms of menopause, so I was sure that my ovary wasn't working. I saw my gynecologist yesterday (she works with my RE) for an ultrasound that thankfully showed my ovary IS working; in fact, it has a dominant follicle and it looks like I will ovulate in a day or two. But this extremely exciting news is overshadowed by the bad news...

My gynecologist says that my brain had adapted to a lifetime of extremely elevated hormones. Even though I am still producing estrogen, my brain is experiencing the loss of all that EXTRA estrogen and believes I am going through menopause. There's nothing I can take that won't interfere with conception/pregnancy, affect my tentative hormonal balance, cause serious side effects (SSRI's for example), or potentially feed any remaining microscopic cancer cells, causing a recurrence. So I am stuck, actively menstruating, actively trying to conceive, and ALSO going through full-blown, severe menopause.

I have hot flashes, excessive/constant sweating, severe night sweats that cause me to soak through multiple changes of clothing and bedding; dry skin, eyes, and ears; a painfully dry vagina (she says it's atrophy!); anorgasmia (devastating); difficulty becoming aroused at all; mood swings and sudden, agonizing depression.

157,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Tonight I need some advice on where to go from here from all of you wonderful people. 

I’ll give you a brief background. 

I’m 22 years old and from the UK. I’ve been trying for a baby with my husband for 3 years now. Everyone told me I was too young and it was a stupid move, but now I know what I know, I don’t regret it at all. My husband is 10 years older than me. 

1 year in, I got a diagnosis of PCOS. Standard told to lose weight. Did 2 rounds of clomid at a private clinic and these didn’t work and I didn’t ovulate. We didn’t want to pay any more money for further failed attempts as at the time our money was limited. 

2 years in. I’ve now lost a stone at this point in weight and my periods have not returned still. I am still not ovulating. 
Was getting pretty drained at this stage so went and saw our NHS family doctor who referred me to an NHS funded fertility clinic. 

At this clinic they did my AMH, which came back as 29.50 pmol (I was told this was fine) and my husband sperm analysis was done.

His sperm analysis did not come back good at all. He has no fast progressive sperm, 31% of his sperm swims slowly and the rest just stands around.  His ‘count’ is ok, but not fantastic. It’s on the lower side of normal. He is a fit, healthy none smoker. Not overweight and owns his own gym so it was sadly ironic when the NHS doctors told him to lose weight too.

The NHS clinic (if you’re American, NHS means free healthcare and not privately funded) told me to go away and lose weight again, despite the fact my husbands sperm was clearly poor. 

I lost a further stone, now we are into year 3 of trying. The weight loss still has not brought my periods on. I have ovulated three times in three years. And even if I was ovulating every month- my husband has NO sperm that swims progressively fast so I still feel we would be out of luck.

So last month we sat down and decided we were going to opt for private treatment and pay for it ourselves because all the NHS can throw out at me is ‘LOSE WEIGHT OR WE WONT HELP!!’ It’s been 3 years now. This is not a game anymore. This is serious. 

We’ve got a moderate amount of savings thankfully, and the clinic I have arranged a consultation at offers something called an ‘IVF REFUND PROGRAM’ where women under the age of 35 with a good AMH can pay £9,000 (not including medication) for 3 cycles of IVF and if these cycles fail, you’re given a refund. 

My worry here is, I’m terrified the private consultant we are due to see in 2 weeks won’t take us seriously again and will brush us off and tell us to lose weight again. We are paying a lot of money to see this consultant, £250 for one hour, and it’d break my heart if we had no resolution or plan in place still. 

Another issue we have got, I was told by the receptionist on the phone that the consultant will discuss our treatment options with us. 
Do we have a say in this matter? 
We ideally do not want to pay for costly medicated IUIs that provide us with a 15% chance of pregnancy. One natural round of IUI at our clinic is £900, but of course I don’t ovulate naturally so I’d need a medicated IUI cycle - the cost of this jumps to £1,300. This is not money we want to throw out for a 15% chance of pregnancy, if that. 

We are working with a limited amount of savings and we want the most bang for our buck, so to say. If IVF gives us a better success rate, and hopefully
Frozen embryos left over afterward for further children we would rather do this. Our worry is that we will throw money at IUIs and other drugs and then be told we do indeed need IVF so then we won’t have the savings left to pay for the IVF.
The success rate for a live birth following one embryo transfer is 40% at our chosen clinic if you are under 35.

The problem with that is, we’ve been messed around so much and forced into having treatments we did not want and were not going to work. 

It’s been 3 years. IVF should probably be our ‘go to’ now, am I right in saying this? 2 years ago, IVF was my
Worst fear, but now my worst fear is never becoming a mother.

My insurance is playing games with me and I’m getting so frustrated! First call was on Thursday of last week when I asked the medical benefits coordinator if I had fertility coverage and they said I did and ran down a list of everything and emailed me the pages from my handbook that states my coverage. I then called the pharmacy line and ran down the list of medicine I needed and they said everything is covered but some need prior authorization. I called my doctors office and spoke to someone there who sent over the authorizations. Within an hour, I got a call from my doctors office who said ALL of my medicine was denied. I could have accepted it but I was confused because 2 people from my insurance company had told me my medicine would be covered. So, I called my insurances pharmacy line again and spoke with a man who said my medication is covered under my plan and that the authorizations were closed in error. He told me that he would reopen them and get them approved. I got a call from CVS specialty(the pharmacy filling my medication) who said that my insurance was rejecting all the medication, even the ones not needing preauthoization. I then called back and spoke to a woman from my insurance who stated that CVS can’t fill my medication because they’re not my designated speciality pharmacy but that all my medication is covered and approved and that I just need to call my doctor to send the prescriptions over the alliancerx(my insurances speciality pharmacy). I called my doctor and sent everything over to alliance. Alliance called and said everything but Gonal-f, Cetrotide, menopur, and endometrin is covered because there is no preauthorizations in the system. I call back(my insurance) and spoke to a gentleman who states there is no preauth for the Gonal, the Cetrotide, and the endometrin in the system but the menopur was denied. He also stayed “i’m not sure why it was denied, your insurance will cover these meds”. I called my doctor immediately and they said they sent the authorizations over and they were all denied and they had denial letters for each medication. I called the pharmacy line again and a woman said “oh yeah everything’s in here but it was denied. Not sure why”. I was fed up at this point and finally asked to speak to a supervisor. Finally a supervisor got on the phone and she said that my medication should be covered and she’s very sorry for the run around and that she will call back today, Monday. She did call back today and did a 3 way conversation with my medical benefits department and as soon as she came back on the line, from initiating the 3-way phone call, she said “it appears you don’t have any fertility benefits actually” and I actually laughed cause I had called a medical benefits coordinator this morning who reiterated what I had and I had an expert from my medical handbook in front of me. The medical benefits coordinator said “yes, I’m sorry you have no coverage” and I explained my policy that I had in front of me and what the medical coordinator said to me just a few hours ago and the medical rep got nervous and was like “ let me put you on hold” and she came back and was like “you’re actually right” and the pharmacy department supervisor said she’d call the clinical team to try and approve my medication.

I then called back and spoke to a woman from my insurance who stated that CVS can’t fill my medication because they’re not my designated speciality pharmacy but that all my medication is covered and approved and that I just need to call my doctor to send the prescriptions over the alliancerx(my insurances speciality pharmacy). I called my doctor and sent everything over to alliance. Alliance called and said everything but Gonal-f, Cetrotide, menopur, and endometrin is covered because there is no preauthorizations in the system. I call back(my insurance) and spoke to a gentleman who states there is no preauth for the Gonal, the Cetrotide, and the endometrin in the system but the menopur was denied. He also stayed “i’m not sure why it was denied, your insurance will cover these meds”. I called my doctor immediately and they said they sent the authorizations over and they were all denied and they had denial letters for each medication. I called the pharmacy line again and a woman said “oh yeah everything’s in here but it was denied. Not sure why”. I was fed up at this point and finally asked to speak to a supervisor. Finally a supervisor got on the phone and she said that my medication should be covered and she’s very sorry for the run around and that she will call back today, Monday. She did call back today and did a 3 way conversation with my medical benefits department and as soon as she came back on the line, from initiating the 3-way phone call, she said “it appears you don’t have any fertility benefits actually” and I actually laughed cause I had called a medical benefits coordinator this morning who reiterated what I had and I had an expert from my medical handbook in front of me. The medical benefits coordinator said “yes, I’m sorry you have no coverage” and I explained my policy that I had in front of me and what the medical coordinator said to me just a few hours ago and the medical rep got nervous and was like “ let me put you on hold” and she came back and was like “you’re actually right” and the pharmacy department supervisor said she’d call the clinical team to try and approve my medication. Another long hold and she said they’re going to review this for me and she’ll call me in 48 hours!! I’m getting so frustrated. I feel like I’m being pushed around over this!</p>

178,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

Long time lurker, first time poster here. It's been a rollercoaster ride (as I'm sure you all know) and I thought I'd share our experience and see if we can give and get some thoughts on these subjects.

&#x200B;

**Background**: We're both 38 and thought we have not tried for long (started about a year ago and had maybe 6 months of effective tries - with regular sex around the ovulation window). We were a little anxious because ideally we'll have 2 - though of course we'll be more than happy with 1. So we visited a few doctors.  


**Me**: I had a varicocele and my TMSC (total motile sperm count) was very low at around 1.5mil. I had a surgery and changed a lot of habits and was able to get TMSC to about 50mil (high concentration and volume but still somewhat low motility at 18%). I've been taking multivitamins plus some vitamin C and zinc somewhat regularly since then.

&#x200B;

**The wife**: she had a small polyp which was removed, and seems to have endometriosis foci which are not visible in exams. She had a hysterosalpingography and it showed good flow on both sides.

&#x200B;

Her polypectomy was last January so, with us both roughly in order, the advice was for us to keep trying for another 6 months. We were not sure. After talks with a doctor we decided to alternate IVF rounds (freezing blastocysts) on one cycle with natural tries on another and see what kind of results we'd get. So we tried in February, did the 1st IVF round in March, tried in April and did the second IVF round in the end of May.

&#x200B;

**1st IVF cycle**: she took 300IU and then 225IU of Menopur every 24h, and Microflare 20IU every 12h. Then 2 amps Choriomon 2 days before retrieval. Etradyoil went up to 5820 on retrieval day, so a little bit of overstimulation there. She had 16 follicles, 10 retrieved eggs, 5 mature eggs, 3 fertilized, 1 of which was in good shape on D3 and none developed into blastocysts by D6.  


We tried naturally on the next cycle but apparently all the treatment delayed her ovulation by about 5 days (she's usually pretty regular) so we probably missed the window (we will of course spread out the natural tries on the next cycle - and we'll use an ovulation kit this time).

&#x200B;

**2nd IVF cycle**: she started on daily rubs of 25mg of Androgel after the first cycle. About 2 weeks before the cycle she started taking CoQ10 (maybe too close to the cycle?). And the doctor tried a different approach to try and reduce overstimulation. 2 amps of Pergoveris daily, 1 Duphaston (oral) every 12h, 3 syringes of Gonapeptyl 2 days before retrieval. Estradyol went actually up to a little over 8200 on retrieval day. Numbers were a little better but not very different: again about 16 follicles (1 of which was too enlarged beforehand and the doctor said we'd let this one ""go ahead"" before retrieval), 10 retrieved eggs, 6 mature eggs, 6 fertilized, 4 embryos on D3 of which 1 was in good shape (I'm assuming they mean 8 cells), and today is D5 and no blastocysts yet.

&#x200B;

We thought the first cycle was an outlier with no blastocysts, but 2nd cycle is looking very similar. So now we're facing a few decisions. We'll probably consult with a different doctor just to get a different view of things. Maybe try D3 transfers and see if the embryos fare better inside the uterus? Try different stimulation drugs or dosages to avoid overstimulation? Check if there's a chance her endometriosis has anything to do with it? Any reason to try ICSI/IMSI over IVF? Given the poor performance after fertilization, is it a good idea in the future to have the blastocysts genetically tested before implantation?

&#x200B;

We're glad to answer any questions and thankful if anyone can get us any kind of insight.

&#x200B;

I am not super comfortable with the idea of surrogacy (and would have to afford the $19k for retrieval again + surrogacy expenses) and my husband isn't super comfortable with adoption (and the money/time it would take).

197,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"TL;DR: Newbie with MFI, not coping well and feeling dumb about it

(Also, I know intros are supposed to be in the Welcome Wednesday but I felt like this post was too long and also I didn’t want to wait until Wednesday. I’m really sorry if making a separate post was inappropriate.)

Hi, I’ve been lurking here a few weeks and feel so grateful for all I’ve learned and for the privilege of watching you amazing ladies support each other. Never been a Redditor, but I decided to make an account and see if participating in here might help me get through the next few months (and whatever comes after).

My infertility story in a nutshell: My husband (35) and I started trying a little over a year ago, and after about six cycles stress and anxiety began to set in, at which point I stopped menstruating regularly. After three crazy long cycles in a row, Kaiser Los Angeles referred me to an outside RE and helpfully informed me that I have zero infertility coverage. We decided to start with an SA since it was the cheapest diagnostic test, and that’s when we discovered my husband’s azoospermia. Long story short, he has no vas deferens due to carrying two cystic fibrosis variants; luckily I’m not a carrier; we’re working with a geneticist and getting his parents tested to make sure we don’t need PGD.

When we met with the RE to discuss IVF, she gave us very good odds since I’m relatively young and and have no known issues. Even when she decided I “probably have some component of PCOS” (due to high testosterone, abundant follicles, and the aforementioned irregular periods), she told us this can be a good thing for IVF patients because I might get more eggs per retrieval. Basically, she’s been all sunshine and rainbows (which is fine, I really like her) and my husband is convinced we are going to get a dozen perfect embryos from our first retrieval, transfer one of each gender over the next couple years, have two perfect pregnancies, and be on our merry way.

I felt this way too, at first, but as I read more stories here and elsewhere and learned more about IVF, I realized a lot can go wrong, and even if everything goes right I’m definitely going to be a basket case during the hunger games, TWW, and basically the entire process. Actually, I’ve already been a basket case for weeks. My husband and mom (who I’m very close with) think I’m fixating and freaking myself out for no reason, and I need to just relax, get off the internet, and stop thinking about the whole thing since it’s definitely going to work on the first try (they think) and even if it doesn’t, what will happen will happen and stressing about it isn’t going to change anything.

None of this is helped by the fact that I have ADHD, have been off my meds since starting TTC, and am self-employed and work from home—i.e. I have the motive, means, and opportunity to spend sixteen hours a day obsessing about IF, and that’s pretty much what I’m doing at the moment. My work is suffering, which I’m not happy about, but I’m not sure to what extent I can/should just get over myself and be a fucking adult, or to what extent this is just a shitty and stressful situation and my work is going to suffer for a little while and if that’s what needs to happen that’s okay.

I also feel pretty stupid about coping so poorly given that nothing really bad has happened to me yet. I’ve only been TTC for a year, I’ve never had a miscarriage or anything, and I haven’t even been diagnosed with anything serious. I feel 100% that our infertility is ours, but I also feel like I should be the one supporting my husband since he’s the one with the gut-wrenching diagnosis. Yet somehow here I am wallowing and fixating and fighting depression while he seemed to pretty much accept his condition and immediately look forward to the next step. Maybe there’s some processing going on under the surface that he hasn’t talked to me about, but it’s definitely not affecting his daily life.

When I think about what all of you have gone through and yet still manage to keep it together day to day, I feel like I’m being a total baby. Am I?

203,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"First time poster here, hopefully I'm not breaking any rules. I'm seeing a Reproductive Endocrinologist next week and wanted to get a sense of what I'm in for. The research that I've done online seems to indicate there's a series of tests I need to do at different points of the cycle, and then my insurance requires 3 rounds of IUI prior to IVF.

My estimation is that I should be able to get all the testing done in June, especially since I work next to the hospital I will be using. In theory, it means that I should be able to do IUI in July and Aug as rounds 1 & 2.

Here are the questions maybe someone with IUI experience can help with:

* I'm traveling on family vacations sans husband during part or all of my fertile window for June, July, and Aug. From what I've read online, the usual tactic is to do an insemination when the person gets a positive OPK. Do doctors allow you to inseminate on, for example,  CD 11 when you think you'll be ovulating on CD 14 and will be out of town?
* Obviously my family doesn't know we're TTC and I'm not ok with sharing that with them. Is it likely that I'll need to take injectable fertility meds while on vacation or is it more likely the doctor will prescribe a pill? Pills I can hide, injections are obviously going to be pretty difficult to hide because I don't have confidence I could inject myself. Also, I've heard emotional side effects can be bad with the meds, so do you need to take them once you ovulate? It seems like they would only be taken up to CD 14 or insemination, but I'm not sure.

I'm not interested in waiting longer, I'm 38.5 and dawdling extra months isn't a good idea, so I want to know what I can push for at the doctor's office. Also revenant, this is covered by insurance because I live in a US state that mandates IUI and IVF coverage.  I'm pretty interested in doing IVF so I want to do the 3 rounds of IUI and then IVF if IUI doesn't work.

Logged onto Cvs Caremark, saw my preauthorization was approved, the only thing holding it up was that it has to be filled by CVS Specialty by mail.

So I call CVS Specialty and have to register with them.... I don’t quite understand how already having a CVS as my pharmacy, their Caremark as my prescription coverage, yet CVS Specialty made a few comments like they would have to call my provider to confirm my medication even after explaining my pharmacist told me she called them and transferred the prescription, and then they have to do a benefits verification.... didn’t Cvs Caremark already determine that by approving the preauthorization? The representative I spoke to said they had the preauthorization on file but they still had to “determine the amount I’d be responsible to pay.”

The benefits verification part made me nervous, Cvs Caremarks website shows it approved and  only issue mentioned is it has to be filled by CVS Specialty, all I can think is CVS Specialty will do something and all of a sudden I’m going to get denied coverage for it.

Another concern is I had to call them twice and the second person had no record of the prior rep registering me. The first call the rep made no mention of the medication being infertility related and didn’t ask me if I was doing IUI or IVF, the second representative did. On a plus side she understood that I need this processed ASAP and marked it as urgent as she was doing fertility treatment herself, when the prior rep didn’t understand my stress when I said I had to have it by Friday at the absolute latest and he kept saying it could take 3 business days to confirm my prescription before they would mail it out.

I was fully ready to pay out of pocket elsewhere, my local hospitals pharmacy quoted me $91 out of pocket and they could get it ordered overnight.

I don’t quite understand how already having a CVS as my pharmacy, their Caremark as my prescription coverage, yet CVS Specialty made a few comments like they would have to call my provider to confirm my medication even after explaining my pharmacist told me she called them and transferred the prescription, and then they have to do a benefits verification.... didn’t Cvs Caremark already determine that by approving the preauthorization? The representative I spoke to said they had the preauthorization on file but they still had to “determine the amount I’d be responsible to pay.”</p>

<p>The benefits verification part made me nervous, Cvs Caremarks website shows it approved and  only issue mentioned is it has to be filled by CVS Specialty, all I can think is CVS Specialty will do something and all of a sudden I’m going to get denied coverage for it.</p>

<p>Another concern is I had to call them twice and the second person had no record of the prior rep registering me. The first call the rep made no mention of the medication being infertility related and didn’t ask me if I was doing IUI or IVF, the second representative did. On a plus side she understood that I need this processed ASAP and marked it as urgent as she was doing fertility treatment herself, when the prior rep didn’t understand my stress when I said I had to have it by Friday at the absolute latest and he kept saying it could take 3 business days to confirm my prescription before they would mail it out.</p>

<p>I was fully ready to pay out of pocket elsewhere, my local hospitals pharmacy quoted me $91 out of pocket and they could get it ordered overnight. </p>

<p>Anyone with no infertility treatment coverage also able to get infertility medication covered through their prescription coverage?</p>

<p>It feels too good to be true and I just got a knot in my stomach until I know when I call Monday/Tuesday what’s going on.</p>

Maybe this is common knowledge but over my last 6 IVF cycles I never knew about this so I thought maybe sharing this would be helpful to some. 

I was on a long lupron protocol and stimmed CD3-13 with 225 menopur and 375 gonal-F (increased from 225 CD 2-5). The day of trigger my E2 was about 3350 and P4 was 1.81 ng/mL. My clinic called to tell me while they were going to proceed with ER, the cycle would be freeze-all due to P4 levels being above the clinic's 1.5 threshold. They explained premature rise in progesterone can potentially affect endometrial receptivity and lower implantation rates. In my research it seems like this is because higher P4 before/on day of trigger can mature/advance your lining so it is out of synch with embryos for fresh transfer. Since then I've done a lot of research on this. And found lots of conflicting data. It seems like P4 can have an impact on overall implantation and pregnancy rates in fresh cycles (and my RE stated that since they started implementing this threshold their success rates have increased dramatically) but does not affect Frozen transfer success rates. However, it seems like the threshold for a negative impact on implantation/pregnancy may be higher for high responders (20+ oocytes retrieved, P4 threshold of 2.0 before/day of trigger) and lower for low responders (<8 oocytes retrieved, can't remember exactly but is included in the study). 

The below link seems to have aggregated a lot of research on the topic. I have chosen to proceed with a fresh transfer based on my ER results and what I have learned (21 oocytes, 18 mature, 12 fertilized) but thought it was relevant for consideration by others- whether your clinic follows a set protocol based on their chosen P4 threshold or if your RE is not monitoring your P4 and requesting that they do so could allow you to make a more informed decision on what type of transfer to pursue and hopefully contribute to more success.

I'm new to the infertility sub, and it was like an easter egg moment when I discovered a random post written by a physician in training... it's such a unique, ridiculous (and don't forget ironic) situation that I wanted to see what other peoples' thoughts are - as I think there are quite a few people here with medical backgrounds. I just NEED to understand how other people are doing this. We put off our entire lives through residency and fellowship to get to this point, and then seem to still have no time to deal with the ramifications it has on our lives and fertility.

My background: a neonatology fellow in a level IV with very heavy service/call obligations that are often just brutal. There is no time for anything, as we all know. I've had a couple of my co-fellows go through infertility treatment and difficult pregnancies and it is just effing terrible. One was on service, couldn't move things around, was covering the L&D and trying to sneak in monitoring ultrasounds while doing her IVF cycle simultaneously during the day. She was so traumatized by it because she also has a very sensitive medical history and didn't need half the unit up in her business - considering we all have access to the L&D boards and are pretty much obligated to know what's on it, especially when she was admitted for prolonged monitoring due to complications and her entire history was out there in her H&P section. But we also must use our hospital for care due to insurance and we also get all the high risk referrals. WHAT GIVES?

Infertility background: 30yo with mild PCOS, husband is 32 and also a physician, our hospitals are not located close together. Getting a semen analysis done was practically an act of god as he is OR based and has absolutely no flex time or ability to just duck out for an hour or two even to go to the next building over. Most of his calls are late calls rather than overnights with a post call day, so that doesn't really help. We weren't sure that it was actually going to happen until he physically left the hospital to walk across the street to do it, and quite honestly, he would have stopped halfway through had his pager gone off while there if one of his residents was trying to reach him. He will always put his patients first. I at least have the benefit of post call days because I have so many calls. Double edged sword.

We are gearing up for IUI due to mild PCOS symptoms (mildly but not horribly off LH/FSH/testosterone, incredibly irregular cycles and ovulation maybe a couple times a year). The semen analysis wasn't perfect (kind of lowish morphology and 2+/3+ progressive motility) but with high enough counts that we think there's enough good sperm in there %age wise. I, obviously, need to ovulate.

IUI question: How did you and your RE truly weigh the pros and cons of Clomid cycles vs gonadotropin cycles to absolutely maximize your chances of success?  I know for some people, the deciding factor is that they don't want to spend money on gonadotropins for IUI when IVF generally has a much better chance of working, and I would love to hear some perspectives on how people made this decision. All of the above said - I just can't see how it would be even remotely possible to fit in all the monitoring appointments IVF would require. With relatively mild PCOS symptoms and a not great but still <30 BMI, my feeling is that with the right protocol IUI actually probably has a pretty good chance of working, but we need to do it aggressively and not view it as a stopgap to getting to IVF... but I also don't want high risk quads either, you know?

I&#39;m wondering if we even stand a chance this cycle now and if it means that letrozole won&#39;t work for me in additional cycles too. Has anyone experienced this? Also, what&#39;s the general consensus on late ovulation? I was concerned about it, but mainly started meds due to a short luteal phase. Thanks.</p>

ORIGINAL POST:
My husband and I waited 4 months to have our phone call consultation with CNY fertility. We submitted all of our records and completed all ""portal"" information back in March.  Because they stress the importance of getting records and information in, 10 days prior to the phone call, one would would assume the reason would be so the doctor has an opportunity to review and develop a plan to present to you based upon your specific case and individual needs.  

Our call was scheduled at 11 and my husband was going to meet me in my work's parking lot so we could be together during the appointment.  The doctor called at 10:15, saying she was running early and understood when I kindly asked that she call back around 11 so my husband could be present.  

The first question she asked was when my last period was. Okay,  cool, that's important information. 

Then she asked ""and the sperm count/morphology was good?"" 

Pause. 

""Um, no, that's one of our concerns... I'm sorry,  did you not receive the records we sent in? I called a month ago to double check that they made it there."" 

""Yes, I have them.  Any cancer in the family?"" 

""Yes,  my mother blah blah blah... it should all be in the portal and records, so I'm just going off of my memory with dates."" 

She then asked if I had any surgeries, if my paps were normal and if we had any previous treatments.

I explained that we had two failed IUIs with meds and that's why we were considering IVF. All test results should be in the portal and records.

""Yes, we got the results but our computer system is cumbersome so it helps when the patient can supplement the information"". 

She then asked if I was familiar with IVF to which I responded yes, and she proceeded to explain to me what the process for IVF is and what the schedule looks like...all information I could glean from their website.  It felt like she was literally reading from their website. Then she told me to start taking a vitamin I could find on Amazon.  She then asked if I had any questions. I was so angry I said no. 

""You don't have ANY questions?"" 

(Very politely, I may add)
""To be honest,  I'm a little disappointed in this phone call,  we've waited 4 months and sent in all of our paperwork and anticipated hearing a plan specific to our needs, and it seems that information hasn't been reviewed in depth to present us with our next steps, tailored to our specific case.""

""...Wow."" 

She apologized that we felt disappointed and said if we had any questions we could reach out.  

When we hung up I immediately burst into anger- tears.  

That was it. The phone call from start to finish was 11 minutes. My husband and I took off of work for this?! Their computer system is cumbersome?! You guys are making babies with the miracles of modern science but you can't figure out your damn computer system?! There is no way she reviewed any of our records. She could've at least skimmed through them between the first time she called and the second phone call!  We've put things on hold for 4 months waiting for this phone call. And on top of everything, when she said ""...wow"", she said it like I was being rude.  I asked my husband (who, trust me,  wouldn't lie about this) if I had at all been rude or disrespectful and he assured me I had not.  

I'm so angry. I know there is a waiting list until March 2020 for these consultation calls and I sincerely hope our phone call was the exception; hopefully not all consultation calls are like ours was.  If you are on the waiting list,  I highly recommend not putting your life on hold or anticipating a grand game plan based upon your reproductive needs.

IVF in China

We live in a 2nd tier city in China, and my husband and I both work here. We went through the IVF process at a major public hospital in our city. It’s a women and children’s hospital (top in the city; it’s a research hospital. If you want the name send me a PM).  

Initially, the biggest barrier was finding information, since I’m hardly conversational in Mandarin and didn’t want to let friends/colleagues know what we were up to, so had to avoid direct questions. I eventually found a private, English-speaking clinic that provided translators for procedures at Chinese hospitals. The translator was able to get me A LOT more information,  as well as set up appointments and such. Her quoted price for the entire procedure, from initial consult to embryo transfer, was 1,000 RMB (just under $150 USD) and honestly I would’ve paid her more cause she did so much work for us.

The first appointment was overwhelming. All in one afternoon, I did: pap smear, transvaginal ultrasound, breast ultrasound, chest x-ray, and ECG. Most of the results were ready either immediately or an hour or two after the procedure, and could be printed from a machine in the hallway.  A couple days later I did some fasting bloodwork. I was entered in a clinical trial where they measured my oxidative stress at a couple points in my IVF cycle. I haven’t seen any results on that. But they also tested hormones, blood type, karyotyping, and various STIs. My husband did some blood work as well that included some of those same tests. Once all the results came in (which took over a month), we had an apt for the Dr to look over the results, and once approved, everything (including proof of identity and marriage) had to be scanned and uploaded to a government website for approval. Then we had to make hospital files  that contained scans of our passport and marriage license, and had to be under a Chinese name (so we made something up). The file making process took about all day. Though I was impressed that my husband’s file was made by a male fertility specialist, who went over his SA and did an exam to check for varicosity. No need for a referral to another clinic to get his side of things checked out.

One thing you have to understand about a Chinese public hospital: waiting in line for over an hour is normal, and waiting for three hours happens from time to time. These hospitals have adopted methods to deal with the massive population, and that involves taking a number, waiting for ages, and having little privacy (HIPPAA isn’t a thing here). Once you get called back, say for a monitoring ultrasound, you go to the room, wait in line there for a bit, and when you finally cram inside with 10-15 other patients in the same tiny room, you hand your paperwork to the assistant at the desk, avert your eyes from where other women are getting undressed for their ultrasound, and when it’s your turn you just strip down and climb on the table, pretending no one can see you. Most women will wear a dress or long shirt for a little additional privacy. There’s no paper sheet covering your lap, just one on the table under your butt that you throw in the trash when you’re done to make room for the next person. Sound scary? You’ll get used to it.

My baseline for stims was on March 1st, and we were good to go! I got a prescription for enough gonal f to cover the first 6 days, and went to the injection room for my first shot and training on how to do it. A lot of women just went to the clinic every day rather than do the shots themselves. But I found that inconvenient. The first week, things were chugging along. I was given a new prescription for meds when I went in for monitoring rather than buying everything at once. By the second week, though, I was going in every day, which meant I was only buying one day’s meds at a time. It also meant I was there basically 3 hours every day, which sucked schedule-wise since I was still working. My job is semi-flexible, but I started to get complaints from students about classes being moved constantly, which added to my stress.  

I finally got a date for the trigger shot: Wednesday the 13th! Because my egg retrieval would be at 8:45 am on Friday, I had to go in to the hospital at 8:45 at night to get this done (they didn’t allow IM shots in the butt to be done at home – it’s actually illegal for me to have access to that kind of needle). The hospital was dark and creepy, but I went to an inpatient ward and a nurse who spoke English gave it to me at the right time. The next day, I checked into the hospital at 2pm for my inpatient procedure.  I paid 250 RMB ($37 USD) for a bed in a double room rather than triple room (no single room available) and my roommate was super sweet. She and her husband spoke a little English and they ordered some food for me, and wouldn’t let me pay them back.

Next day was egg retrieval. I was woken at 6:45 by a nurse taking my temperature. Then a phlebotomy cart came by to take my blood. Soon, it was time to go to the waiting room for the procedure. A big group of us walked there together. I was the fourth to be called from that group (an unlucky number in China, but hey, it's high on the list!): the nurse called me back by calling “the foreigner” rather than my name (she probably couldn’t pronounce it). Everyone in the waiting room chuckled. The first thing we had to do was remove our shoes and socks and put on slippers provided for us, so no special socks for the procedure. Then we were split up.

A nurse handed me hospital clothes and motioned getting undressed, so I did that. She tied my hospital clothes for me, tucked my hair into a cap, and pointed at a toilet. I got the picture. A minute later, I was sitting on a bench with three other women, two of whom had IVs and one who was getting one. One woman said she recognized me from the outpatient department a few days before. I had gotten fed up with waiting for the injection room, and I sat right down and did my own injection in the hallway. They said they thought I was brave.  I wasn’t able to communicate that no, I wasn’t brave, I was just hormonal, impatient, and a little pissed off.

I got my IV, waited, and was taken down the hallway to wait some more. I could see a long hallway with multiple ORs on either side. Every now and then a stretcher with a groggy looking woman would be wheeled out. Soon, I was taken to an OR.

The OR was… chaos. It was dark, but there were a LOT of people inside, and the first thing I saw was the naked lower body of another women on the bed in stirrups in front of me. I averted my eyes, but there were at least 5 other beds with 5 other naked women, and several Drs/techs per patient. There was constant movement and noise around me and I was in a bit of shock. Then the woman in front of me got up (she didn’t seem sedated) and I was instructed to take off my pants and lie down.  There was a giant spotlight shining at my naked crotch.  The male Dr sitting there asked me where I was from, and said “It’s a very beautiful city.” I thought: this is an odd thing to be talking about while naked. Then I was out.

I was comfortably tucked in a bed being moved somewhere. I wondered if this meant the procedure was finished. I asked, “finish ma?” Someone said, “yes, finish”.  

After a brief time in a recovery room, I was taken back to my room and had some lunch delivered.  Later the Dr came by and said because they got 27 eggs I was at risk for OHSS, so I was to stay inpatient over the weekend to try to prevent it. Luckily, a single room had become available so I moved there. Over the weekend I received IV fluids every day, and was instructed to “eat LOTS and LOTS of shrimp” (for the protein) and “drink hot watermelon juice, cold won’t do.” The staff was also unhappy that my husband went home to sleep at night, but honestly I think we both slept better that way.

Come Sunday afternoon, sure enough my belly had inflated and was painful, so I was kept for a few more days.  Cue more class rescheduling for me and less time at the hospital for my husband since \*gasp\* he had to work! We got our embryo report on Monday, though, which we both had to be physically present for. Out of 27 eggs retrieved, 21 were mature, 19 had fertilized, and 9 made it to day 3. We were informed that four embryos had already been frozen at this stage, two per straw, and five more were being cultured to blastocyst. And after a couple more days of IV fluids and meds, I was finally released on Wednesday. Come day 5, we were told we had 1 blastocyst and two still growing, and by day 6 we had one more. Of course, both of these reports required us to take time off work and come to the clinic in person. Plus, I was told to spend the next two months resting and recovering, and we’d do a frozen embryo transfer in May.

Fast forward two long months…. My period started on my 29th birthday. I went in for a baseline ultrasound the next day and got a prescription for estrogen. At first lining check, they said “everything looks normal, your lining is 4.5.” I was worried but thought maybe it was supposed to grow more… but come the next lining check, it was exactly the same. Apparently they only measure half the lining! In American terms, my lining was 8.9. Then it was PIO for 5 days until transfer.

Transfer was interesting. My husband was required to be there to sign papers, but he wasn’t allowed to go back with me. I was changed into hospital garb (just like for retrieval), my hair covered and given a hospital wristband. Then I was taken back to a room labeled “Embryo Ransfer of Room 2” where upon entering, I saw two women lying very spread eagle in stirrups while several other patients and workers stood around waiting/watching. There was a little glass door leading to (I assumed) the lab and every now and then a long plastic tube would be passed through. Several doctors/nurses were making small talk with me, very curious about details of my life, surprised to see a foreigner. Finally it was my turn. I stripped in front of everyone, and in went speculum and then embryo without ceremony (and no picture of it, or ultrasound of it going in either). Then I was immediately instructed to get up and dress, and I was taken to a recovery room by wheelchair where I laid in bed for 30 minutes while someone gave further instructions in Chinese (but my translator wasn’t allowed in for this part). Then I left! I was given two weeks worth of progesterone and estrogen and instructed to come in 14 days for a blood test. According to my translator, I was to resume normal activity, but rest more, keep my belly warm, drink only hot water (nothing cold) and avoid spicy food. I’m not sure how much of this was from the doctor and how much was from the translator.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I kept a detailed record of expenses throughout the egg retrieval cycle (all in all we spent around $4,000 USD for the stim cycle including meds, diagnostics, and hospitalization) but I slacked off during the FET cycle. I’ve kept all the receipts (I think) and one of these days I’ll go through them and add everything to the spreadsheet, which I’m happy to share if anyone wants.

Sorry this was so long! There were so many weird details I wanted to include! But the big question may be, would I recommend China for IVF tourism? Honestly no… if you already live here, it’s great! But because of how much plane tickets cost, how much the government restricts it (have to prove you’re legally married, and donor gametes/surrogacy are illegal) I think there are several options that are better.

Most of the results were ready either immediately or an hour or two after the procedure, and could be printed from a machine in the hallway.  A couple days later I did some fasting bloodwork. I was entered in a clinical trial where they measured my oxidative stress at a couple points in my IVF cycle. I haven’t seen any results on that. But they also tested hormones, blood type, karyotyping, and various STIs. My husband did some blood work as well that included some of those same tests. Once all the results came in (which took over a month), we had an apt for the Dr to look over the results, and once approved, everything (including proof of identity and marriage) had to be scanned and uploaded to a government website for approval. Then we had to make hospital files  that contained scans of our passport and marriage license, and had to be under a Chinese name (so we made something up). The file making process took about all day. Though I was impressed that my husband’s file was made by a male fertility specialist, who went over his SA and did an exam to check for varicosity. No need for a referral to another clinic to get his side of things checked out.</p>

<p>One thing you have to understand about a Chinese public hospital: waiting in line for over an hour is normal, and waiting for three hours happens from time to time. These hospitals have adopted methods to deal with the massive population, and that involves taking a number, waiting for ages, and having little privacy (HIPPAA isn’t a thing here). Once you get called back, say for a monitoring ultrasound, you go to the room, wait in line there for a bit, and when you finally cram inside with 10-15 other patients in the same tiny room, you hand your paperwork to the assistant at the desk, avert your eyes from where other women are getting undressed for their ultrasound, and when it’s your turn you just strip down and climb on the table, pretending no one can see you. Most women will wear a dress or long shirt for a little additional privacy. There’s no paper sheet covering your lap, just one on the table under your butt that you throw in the trash when you’re done to make room for the next person. Sound scary? You’ll get used to it.</p>

<p>My baseline for stims was on March 1st, and we were good to go! I got a prescription for enough gonal f to cover the first 6 days, and went to the injection room for my first shot and training on how to do it. A lot of women just went to the clinic every day rather than do the shots themselves. But I found that inconvenient. The first week, things were chugging along. I was given a new prescription for meds when I went in for monitoring rather than buying everything at once. By the second week, though, I was going in every day, which meant I was only buying one day’s meds at a time. It also meant I was there basically 3 hours every day, which sucked schedule-wise since I was still working. My job is semi-flexible, but I started to get complaints from students about classes being moved constantly, which added to my stress.  </p>

<p>I finally got a date for the trigger shot: Wednesday the 13th! Because my egg retrieval would be at 8:45 am on Friday, I had to go in to the hospital at 8:45 at night to get this done (they didn’t allow IM shots in the butt to be done at home – it’s actually illegal for me to have access to that kind of needle). The hospital was dark and creepy, but I went to an inpatient ward and a nurse who spoke English gave it to me at the right time. The next day, I checked into the hospital at 2pm for my inpatient procedure.  I paid 250 RMB ($37 USD) for a bed in a double room rather than triple room (no single room available) and my roommate was super sweet. She and her husband spoke a little English and they ordered some food for me, and wouldn’t let me pay them back.</p>

<p>Next day was egg retrieval. I was woken at 6:45 by a nurse taking my temperature. Then a phlebotomy cart came by to take my blood. Soon, it was time to go to the waiting room for the procedure. A big group of us walked there together. I was the fourth to be called from that group (an unlucky number in China, but hey, it&#39;s high on the list!): the nurse called me back by calling “the foreigner” rather than my name (she probably couldn’t pronounce it). Everyone in the waiting room chuckled. The first thing we had to do was remove our shoes and socks and put on slippers provided for us, so no special socks for the procedure. Then we were split up.</p>

<p>A nurse handed me hospital clothes and motioned getting undressed, so I did that. She tied my hospital clothes for me, tucked my hair into a cap, and pointed at a toilet. I got the picture. A minute later, I was sitting on a bench with three other women, two of whom had IVs and one who was getting one. One woman said she recognized me from the outpatient department a few days before. I had gotten fed up with waiting for the injection room, and I sat right down and did my own injection in the hallway. They said they thought I was brave.  I wasn’t able to communicate that no, I wasn’t brave, I was just hormonal, impatient, and a little pissed off.</p>

<p>I got my IV, waited, and was taken down the hallway to wait some more. I could see a long hallway with multiple ORs on either side. Every now and then a stretcher with a groggy looking woman would be wheeled out. Soon, I was taken to an OR.</p>

<p>The OR was… chaos. It was dark, but there were a LOT of people inside, and the first thing I saw was the naked lower body of another women on the bed in stirrups in front of me. I averted my eyes, but there were at least 5 other beds with 5 other naked women, and several Drs/techs per patient. There was constant movement and noise around me and I was in a bit of shock. Then the woman in front of me got up (she didn’t seem sedated) and I was instructed to take off my pants and lie down.  There was a giant spotlight shining at my naked crotch.  The male Dr sitting there asked me where I was from, and said “It’s a very beautiful city.” I thought: this is an odd thing to be talking about while naked. Then I was out.</p>

<p>I was comfortably tucked in a bed being moved somewhere. I wondered if this meant the procedure was finished. I asked, “finish ma?” Someone said, “yes, finish”.  </p>

<p>After a brief time in a recovery room, I was taken back to my room and had some lunch delivered.  Later the Dr came by and said because they got 27 eggs I was at risk for OHSS, so I was to stay inpatient over the weekend to try to prevent it. Luckily, a single room had become available so I moved there. Over the weekend I received IV fluids every day, and was instructed to “eat LOTS and LOTS of shrimp” (for the protein) and “drink hot watermelon juice, cold won’t do.” The staff was also unhappy that my husband went home to sleep at night, but honestly I think we both slept better that way.</p>

<p>Come Sunday afternoon, sure enough my belly had inflated and was painful, so I was kept for a few more days.  Cue more class rescheduling for me and less time at the hospital for my husband since *gasp* he had to work! We got our embryo report on Monday, though, which we both had to be physically present for. Out of 27 eggs retrieved, 21 were mature, 19 had fertilized, and 9 made it to day 3. We were informed that four embryos had already been frozen at this stage, two per straw, and five more were being cultured to blastocyst. And after a couple more days of IV fluids and meds, I was finally released on Wednesday. Come day 5, we were told we had 1 blastocyst and two still growing, and by day 6 we had one more. Of course, both of these reports required us to take time off work and come to the clinic in person. Plus, I was told to spend the next two months resting and recovering, and we’d do a frozen embryo transfer in May.</p>

<p>Fast forward two long months…. My period started on my 29th birthday. I went in for a baseline ultrasound the next day and got a prescription for estrogen. At first lining check, they said “everything looks normal, your lining is 4.5.” I was worried but thought maybe it was supposed to grow more… but come the next lining check, it was exactly the same. Apparently they only measure half the lining! In American terms, my lining was 8.9. Then it was PIO for 5 days until transfer.</p>

<p>Transfer was interesting. My husband was required to be there to sign papers, but he wasn’t allowed to go back with me. I was changed into hospital garb (just like for retrieval), my hair covered and given a hospital wristband. Then I was taken back to a room labeled “Embryo Ransfer of Room 2” where upon entering, I saw two women lying very spread eagle in stirrups while several other patients and workers stood around waiting/watching. There was a little glass door leading to (I assumed) the lab and every now and then a long plastic tube would be passed through. Several doctors/nurses were making small talk with me, very curious about details of my life, surprised to see a foreigner. Finally it was my turn. I stripped in front of everyone, and in went speculum and then embryo without ceremony (and no picture of it, or ultrasound of it going in either). Then I was immediately instructed to get up and dress, and I was taken to a recovery room by wheelchair where I laid in bed for 30 minutes while someone gave further instructions in Chinese (but my translator wasn’t allowed in for this part). Then I left! I was given two weeks worth of progesterone and estrogen and instructed to come in 14 days for a blood test. According to my translator, I was to resume normal activity, but rest more, keep my belly warm, drink only hot water (nothing cold) and avoid spicy food. I’m not sure how much of this was from the doctor and how much was from the translator.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I kept a detailed record of expenses throughout the egg retrieval cycle (all in all we spent around $4,000 USD for the stim cycle including meds, diagnostics, and hospitalization) but I slacked off during the FET cycle. I’ve kept all the receipts (I think) and one of these days I’ll go through them and add everything to the spreadsheet, which I’m happy to share if anyone wants.</p>

<p>Sorry this was so long! There were so many weird details I wanted to include! But the big question may be, would I recommend China for IVF tourism? Honestly no… if you already live here, it’s great! But because of how much plane tickets cost, how much the government restricts it (have to prove you’re legally married, and donor gametes/surrogacy are illegal) I think there are several options that are better.  But overall, my experience has been positive.</p>

248,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone! I was really trying to wait to make this post until my IVF consult next Wednesday, but I'm having a really hard time with the unknown and not being able to find much information on our scenario. Holy moly this is so long, bless the poor souls that actually read this, but I've been needing to get this off my chest to someone that understands. 

**Background** \- Husband and I have been together 12 years, probably been off birth control 6 years of that time. Not one single positive, ever. My mother had endometriosis and infertility, had a lap and excision and continued to conceive without difficulty. I suspected I had endo as well after realizing not everyone's periods were this bad, had cramping that would take my breath away, cause me to double over, 7+ day periods, painful sex, IBS like symptoms, bladder symptoms, 7-day premenstrual spotting, etc. I eventually take continuous birth control pills, this helps dull some of the symptoms, I normalize all of this as does my OB/Gyn. 

**Starting TTC -** We ""don't prevent"" for about 2 years, then get more serious in summer 2017 since we are really ready at this point, I do OPKs ""just to check"" and I was ovulating exactly when I thought. April 2018 I see my OB, tell her my concerns about endo as symptoms have escalated during this time, including severe back and leg pain. She tells me surgery will only hurt my ovarian reserve and make this even more difficult, I look into this and she is up to date on recommendations. She does kind of blow me off (I suspect partially because I'm 28 at the time) tells me to relax, not do OPKs, only have intercourse once every 2-3 days, tells me I'll probably be fine because I'm young. I'm expecting a RE consult from this appt, she instead recommends I take Clomid for three months with 21-day progesterone labs and see what happens. Against my better judgment, I try it because I do know a lot of people that were successful with just Clomid. No surprise, I ovulate just fine and we are unsuccessful.

**Starting with RE** **-** Jump ahead I take the first available appointment with my RE in January 2019. He gives us new found hope and is ready to immediately do an IUI because it's CD5 and then squeeze testing in around this. We do my first transvaginal ultrasound at this appointment, he finds a 4cm cyst on my left ovary so we can't do the IUI this month, but will do labs, HyCoSy, semen analysis, etc. instead and IUI next cycle. Does AFC, never got an exact number but he counted 12+ on one ovary alone, very positive about it. He tells me my uterus is extremely retroverted and is very surprised this has never been mentioned to me before. He asks about pain, etc. and says I most likely have endo but he ""doesn't get too excited about that"".

**Results:**

AMH - 4.55 ng/ML

TSH - 4.37

HyCoSy all clear

*Semen Analysis* (Reference Values)

Volume - 2.0 mL (>1.5mL)

Viscosity - high (normal)

Sperm Concentration - 103.5/mL (>15million/mL)

Total Motility - 36% (>40%)

Progressive Motility - 25% (>32%)

Total Sperm Count - 207 (>39 million)

Total Motile Count - 74.5 (>9 million) 

Normal Morphology Strict Kruger - 4.5 

I start 25 mcg levothyroxine daily for the elevated TSH and we discuss the reduced motility briefly, doesn't seem to be a huge deal, alludes to ICSI for IVF if needed. Then we get to IUI attempt #1, baseline appt cyst is still there, estradiol to make sure it isn't estrogen producing, it isn't so we proceed. I take 2.5 mg letrozole CD3-7 and have first monitoring appt CD 13, as he expects me to ovulate CD 14-15 based on AMH. At CD 13 appt I've already ovulated, I tell him I think I may have ovulated the day before, he's very befuddled by this. 

**This is where things get weird -** Next IUI attempt is monitoring day 12, I'm already ovulating because he sees free fluid, states if I ovulate earlier we're going to have even bigger problems, the largest of two follicles is a whopping 35mm already. IUI is unsuccessful. IUI #2 baseline appointment he tells me he ""Doesn't want (me) to freak out"" but it looks like I have diminished ovarian reserve, except my labs are fine. He pretty dramatically goes back and forth about how my labs look fine, but a 35 mm follicle is huge, but I'm only 29, producing two follicles on such a low dose, etc, etc.  At the time DOR was not on my radar because of my AMH result and I knew almost no specifics. I ask what this all means, asked several other questions and he tells me honestly he just doesn't know. He seemed so shocked himself that he really couldn't explain anything at all to me. Annoying, but he seems like he genuinely cares and he was trying to figure it out. 

Wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar. I \*think\* this may mean I have high FSH but I haven't had it tested to know for sure, and I'm really just trying to piece this together. At a later appointment, he did say he does think IVF \*can\* work for us, but we just haven't gone into all the details yet. He brought me in even earlier for IUI #3 and increased letrozole dose to try for 3 follicles, at day 11 the largest follicle was already 26mm with no positive OPK yet. Again, said I make large follicles really fast but I just need more understanding and I want to be more prepared for my consult. My cycles before this were 29-32 days (two outlier cycles were 27 days in the last 5 years), everything I read said this was reassuring. Since taking letrozole and levothyroxine they have been 26 & 27 days long with a short follicular phase which I understand is not reassuring. I'm kind of wondering if the subclinical hypothyroid was causing my cycles to be longer and covering this up? I see short cycles mentioned with endometriosis, but with long follicular phases. Also, DOR seems to go along with endometriosis. Has endo damaged my ovaries? Is it possible despite my AMH I will be a poor responder during IVF? Will it be very unpredictable?  I know a lot of people that have had to do varying levels of infertility treatments, but I do not know anyone that has gone this far, for this long, without ever having a single positive, especially at peak fertility ages.

A little worried that I've gone so far in the other direction... I used to be obsessed with getting pregnant and now I feel like I almost don't care.  I know deep down that I do and this is likely a defense mechanism... but at this moment,  I'm numb.  It's been three years of disappointment after disappointment and so much money has already been spent on fruitless treatments.  

The idea that we could be spending tens of thousands of dollars on yet another treatment that might not work (please spare me the ""just be positive!"" speech) is really stressing me out.  We're already stressed about money and can't do the things we'd like to do because of all the money that's been spent on procedures so far. My husband and I have a very strong relationship but I feel like life has been put on such a hold...it's hard to find ways to have fun. Thank goodness the weather is warming up so we can do things outside, but in the middle of the winter,  you can only watch so much TV. There's not a lot to do, that doesn't cost money.  I'm mad.  I'm so mad that we work so hard and can't afford to have any fun because of this God forsaken situation.  It's not fair to see people having babies for FREE and taking vacations with said babies.  I know I don't know anyone's situation but my own and I'm making a lot of judgments but it's frustrating when it seems like everyone else gets to have their cake and eat it too.

Okay, turns out I do have feelings about the situation... but this phone call is another story. I'm not excited,  I'm not anxious, nervous, worried,  etc. I'm kind of just ""blah"". 

I feel guilty for feeling this way because I know there are so many others that would stop at nothing to get pregnant and have a lot of additional barriers that I don't have, who wouldn't dream of having such a callous response to another opportunity to achieve that goal. #runonsentence 

I just don't know if I have it in me anymore.  My hope- account has dried up, along with my bank account. 

At the same time,  after 3 years,  I know these emotions cycle and I might have a much different mindset next week. Who knows.

I know I don&#39;t know anyone&#39;s situation but my own and I&#39;m making a lot of judgments but it&#39;s frustrating when it seems like everyone else gets to have their cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>Okay, turns out I do have feelings about the situation... but this phone call is another story. I&#39;m not excited,  I&#39;m not anxious, nervous, worried,  etc. I&#39;m kind of just &quot;blah&quot;. </p>

<p>I feel guilty for feeling this way because I know there are so many others that would stop at nothing to get pregnant and have a lot of additional barriers that I don&#39;t have, who wouldn&#39;t dream of having such a callous response to another opportunity to achieve that goal. #runonsentence </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know if I have it in me anymore.  My hope- account has dried up, along with my bank account. </p>

<p>At the same time,  after 3 years,  I know these emotions cycle and I might have a much different mindset next week. Who knows.  </p>

<p>This is just where I&#39;m at right now.  </p>

<p>Thanks for listening to me bitch and ramble on, incoherently.   I really needed to get this out.</p>

My husband and I have been going to our RE since February. We really like him and he seems to know what he's doing. 
We've had a bunch of testing done over the 4 years we've been trying. Husband has azoospermia, and we'll be doing a TESE sometime in July to hopefully lead to IVF later this year that we paid for up front and out of pocket for.
Here's where the rant starts. I got a letter from my insurance over the weekend saying that our RE will not be in network at the end of JUNE. So I called the insurance people and they said that there was nothing they could do about it to continue my care, and that it's up to the doctor to renew his contract, etc. 
So I call the office and have to leave a voice mail at 9:30 in the morning. Was not super thrilled about this, but figured they'd call me back. I didn't here back from them by 12:00 so I left a message for the billing department though the office's patient portal. By 3:00 I still hadn't heard from them, so I called again. 
The whole of the billing department had already gone home for the day! WTF. The receptionist informed me that I was not the only person calling concerned about this, and that they were returning calls in the order they were received. How is it that I called at 9:30 in the morning and did not receive a phone call the same business day. 
I need to know if the money we already paid is going to cover everything else we have to do, if they are going to renew their contract with my insurance company, if I need to find a new doctor, if i can get a full refund of the money we already paid if we do have to find a new doctor, etc. Yet I can't get a phone call back the same day. 
Sorry, Rant over.



Update: The RE’s office called me at 7:30 this morning and said that as far as they know they are up to date on all their contracts.

We started trying to get pregnant years ago when we were both around 30 years old. After the first year of trying did all the usual tests and found out my husband has non obstructive azoospermia. Further genetics testing did not reveal anything that would have caused the azoo. All testing on me was fine. Hormones good and tubes open. 

We soul searched for a year after our diagnosis before committing to adoption. 

Fast forward 5 years. We always kept IVF in the back of our minds and we recently got the call that our Canadian funded IVF chance came up so we decided to go for it. The time between the call and the IVF has been short and I’m trying really hard to get caught up on all the lingo and protocols but I’m drowning and just hoping my RE is choosing a good protocol for us. 

We are starting an antagonist protocol at very high doses. My RE said my AFC wasn’t great at 12. I am 36. My AFC when I was 30 years old was more like 35 so I can see the crazy decline over those 5 years. 

I’ll be doing Gonal F 400 and Luveris 150 and then adding in Centrotide on stim day 6. I start my injections this Thursday and I’m SO nervous. 

Has anyone done a similar protocol? Any thoughts?

My husband will be doing micro-tese the same day they do an egg retrieval as our clinic believes that fresh everything works better with testicular sperm if they find any. 

So that’s us! I’m sure I’ll be asking some questions in the next few weeks because I feel totally lost!

I've been trying to get pregnant since May 2016, and started seeing an RE around July 2018. The RE diagnosed me with Stage IV Endometriosis due to the presence of two 3-4cm endometriomas on each ovary. I've gone through one failed IUI since then, on my doctor's recommendation. She's now very adamant that I get ablation surgery on the endo and excise the two endometriomas.

I'm a scientist, so I have access to much of the primary literature and regularly indulge myself in reading studies and reviews on every step of this process. From my research, it seems like there's decent evidence that removing endometriomas may be linked to diminished ovarian reserve and leads to no difference in pregnancy outcomes compared to women with endometriomas who do not get surgery before IVF. Further, surgery seems to be discouraged for fertility alone and only recommended to alleviate pain symptoms. While I have had extreme endo pain in the past, I've found I can greatly reduce flare-ups through changes to my diet, so pain isn't so much of an issue for me right now. To me, it seems clear based on the evidence that I shouldn't get surgery before IVF (especially ablation, given the absurdly high recurrence rates). 

I made the case to my doctor for trying IVF first (without really going full let's-discuss-current-literature on her, because I don't want to seem rude). She told me it was my decision, but she still recommends surgery and she disqualified me from the shared risk program, which is a huge financial blow. I feel that this is out-of-touch with current research, since pregnancy rates are statistically the same. Here are my questions: How far do I push the argument against surgery based on current research? I'm fully aware that I'm not that kind of doctor (lol) and respect her expertise, but I can't find good justification for her opinion in the research. I fear that she's just acquiescing to my demands and may subconsciously treat me differently if I go against her recommendation and go straight to IVF. It also makes me worry that my clinic is not up-to-date with scientific literature. Second, if I stay with her, can I make the argument that I should qualify for shared risk, or do I let it go? Is it time to find a new clinic? That thought gives me anxiety, because I just don't want to start over again.

If you haven't already, please read our sidebar and/or the sticky post listing our rules. If you're on mobile you can find this under ""About Community"" at the top of the page (look for the three dots in the upper right corner).

Mention of pregnancy or positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread. Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C""). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

Secondary infertility and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success.

292,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone. I am relatively new to reddit, and new to posting in communities in general, but I thought it can’t hurt to give it a try. This is my introductory post about my infertility journey.

My husband and I are now both 32, and we began trying to conceive in January of 2018. I have not taken any form of hormonal birth control since 2013, we just used condoms in the interim. I jumped in with both feet and started right away with temping, tracking, ovulation predictor tests, knowing my fertile window and my cycle length, timing intercourse precisely, the whole thing. I always appeared to ovulate (usually on CD11), my luteal phase appeared to be consistently 14 days, and my cycle seemed consistently about 25 or 26 depending on if ovulation was day 11 or day 12. Everything seemed great, except I would get heavy spotting for 6-8 days before my full menstrual flow would arrive, and then that would only last about 3 days. The spotting and short period were normal for me, they’d been happening since I came off the birth control in 2013. 

After 8 cycles of no success and increasing concern over my unexplained spotting I made an appointment with a gynecologist. Not for “infertility”, more for the abnormal bleeding which I never considered as being anything of interest until I was trying to conceive. She said my spotting was not “normal”, but also that she didn’t feel it was causing any delay in us conceiving. She did CD2 bloodwork, tested my thyroid, and checked progesterone on 7DPO and everything came back normal. She put me on oral Prometrium 100mg/day anyway to see if it would change the spotting. It did not. So the next cycle she upped it to 200mg/day, and that also did not have any effect on the spotting. She was discussing an endometrial biopsy when I got very ill suddenly with subacute thyroiditis. Without going into that whole story that illness took up a few months, my husband and I kept trying anyway unsuccessfully, and no biopsy was ever scheduled. By that time the gyn simply referred me to an RE.

My husband and I met with the RE this January 2019. He ordered another CD2 blood panel for me and SA for my husband. Just as before everything looked perfect in my numbers, and my husbands SA also showed great numbers in all stats. I had an SIS that showed nothing notable; the doctor was able to confirm that my left tube was open but unable to confirm or deny the status of my right tube at the time. They said it wasn’t anything to be concerned about.

The doctor suggested that we try Clomid even though I do ovulate to give us more follicles to work with. We did two cycles using 100mg Clomid from days 2-6 (due to my short cycle and early ovulation). Both times my ovulation was on CD13 instead of CD11 so the Clomid definitely changed something. I responded fairly well, showing many follicles at my mid cycle ultrasounds. The only thing is that they seemed to be getting really big prior to ovulation. Unfortunately I don’t remember the numbers from those first two cycles, but the follicles were growing big and quick before my body geared up to ovulate. We used natural ovulation and timed intercourse both times, as well as Endometrin 200mg/day. The Endometrin actually did put a stop to my spotting! That was exciting, even though we did not have a different outcome from those cycles. It’s nice to know that something can have an effect on whatever the root cause is.

We took one month off from intervention to try naturally again, and then went in for Clomid cycle number 3. Same as the first two, but this time we used Ovidrel to trigger ovulation about a day earlier than it would have happened naturally and had an IUI. That cycle on a CD9 ultrasound I one follicle already 30mm, and then 3 or 4 others that were not even 15mm yet. The doctor told me to wait until the night of CD10 and then trigger if I hadn’t surged on my own yet. We did the IUI on CD12, my husbands sperm count was great for it (32 million total motile post wash), but no success.

So now we have just started cycle 20 in this journey. We are going to repeat last cycle with a 4th round of Clomid, probably an Ovidrel trigger, and then an IUI. If this one doesn’t work the doctor has ominously said we will discuss “further options”. I am actually not the one in this partnership that is dying to have kids. My husband seems to have always imagined himself as having children, and I never did. As I am sort of ambivalent about it I agreed to give it a try and see what happened knowing that I would be fine either way. However, that was more like when I thought “trying” just meant having a lot of good sex at the right time and making a baby the fun and free way. This journey has turned into a bigger rabbit hole than I anticipated, and I am in the stage of wondering how many “further options” I am open to trying. They just get more invasive, expensive, and time consuming and it seems like a lot for me to go through when I don’t even have this drive to be a mother like some people do (and feel incredible guilt and shame about that). On the other hand, if I choose not to pursue “further options” I feel like I’m not allowed to be sad about my situation because I didn’t try every option available.

My hubby and I have known for approx 4 years that the only way for us to conceive was via IVF due to Male factor (retrograde, low sperm count, the list goes on). A family is something we have longed for and desired for so long.

About 2 years ago, hubby was diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease, then kidney failure and he is now on dialysis. He is 30 years old, I will be 35 next month. Unfortunately, his chronic conditions have ruled our life for the last several years. He has finally hit a plateau, per say, in his health, and we feel like now is a good time to pursue starting a family.  He's listed on a transplant list and the chances of getting something soonish (1-2 years) are really great.

I am 100% terrified. For the last 2 years, we have been through so much and I have spent a lot of time and energy taking care of him. He's tired, low energy, often doesn't feel well.  We have had numerous conversations about what I am about to go through, but I feel like it hasn't quite registered with him yet.

<p>Our starting appointment is on Tuesday, we will get our retrieval dates at that time. I&#39;m hoping once that appointment is over, I can just be excited. I am not sure how I will juggle my own hormones and emotions as well as a sick hubby. </p>

My wife and I (same sex couple - she is going to carry our first child) have been TTC since last fall. We’ve been working with a RE the entire time. Did 3 IUIs, with a chemical pregnancy on the 2nd try. Our doctor suggested moving to IVF after the 3rd IUI because he said that most people who can get pregnant with IUI will be pregnant by the 3rd or 4th round. Also, my wife’s insurance has a $10k lifetime maximum, which we would have hit after the first round of IVF if we did a 3rd IUI. Anyway, we had our first egg retrieval for IVF on May 8th. They got 9 mature eggs, 6 fertilized, and 3 developed into blastocysts (grades BA, BA, BB). Unfortunately, genetic screening results came back and none were genetically normal so we are back to square 1. We don’t get to see our doc again until June 5th but we know they are going to tell us to try another egg retrieval. It’s not out of the question but even with insurance it is SO expensive and my wife ended up with moderate OHSS from the first retrieval so we’re concerned about that again with a second. It’s also just so emotionally taxing it’s hard to imagine turning around and doing it all again. 

Anyway, just looking for any insight anyone might have on this situation. Anyone been through multiple retrievals? Anything in this history make you think that a second retrieval is likely/unlikely to have different results?

The pressure is really really sinking me deeper and deeper to depression.

But it escalated to the point that people asked me outright ""Why aren't you pregnant yet? Are you barren?"" And people would just laugh about it. 

My father in-law refuses to cut his hair until he has a grand kid. He looks like a homeless guy now and everytime people would ask him why his hair is like that he points at me and says ""because i don't have a grandkid yet"". 

I'm in such pressure. I have PCOS since 2014. I tried going to the doctor, had multiple cycles with clomid and metformin (on and off for metformin) and failed. I'm in another cycle of clomid and testing OPK since cycle day 10. There was quite a spike but it didn't really reach positive. 

My husband on the other hand doesn't seem like very interested. First he doesn't really have the sex drive. We would go on for trying just once in a month and it's not even a good day according to the calendar.

Just want to give context on how much this sucks, my in-law family is putting so much pressure and humiliation on me every family gathering they would ask me when will I have a baby which is fine. But it escalated to the point that people asked me outright &quot;Why aren&#39;t you pregnant yet? Are you barren?&quot; And people would just laugh about it. </p>

<p>My father in-law refuses to cut his hair until he has a grand kid. He looks like a homeless guy now and everytime people would ask him why his hair is like that he points at me and says &quot;because i don&#39;t have a grandkid yet&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in such pressure. I have PCOS since 2014. I tried going to the doctor, had multiple cycles with clomid and metformin (on and off for metformin) and failed. I&#39;m in another cycle of clomid and testing OPK since cycle day 10. There was quite a spike but it didn&#39;t really reach positive. </p>

<p>My husband on the other hand doesn&#39;t seem like very interested. First he doesn&#39;t really have the sex drive. We would go on for trying just once in a month and it&#39;s not even a good day according to the calendar. </p>

<p>I feel like crying and i just don&#39;t want to do this shit anymore. :( I have no one else to talk to too. My two best friends are now moms and one of them is giving birth on June and I don&#39;t want to spoil the fun. </p>

<p>I cannot do this anymore.</p>
