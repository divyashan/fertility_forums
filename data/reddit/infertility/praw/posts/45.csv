Anyway I told her I was ""super nervous"" about helping her select a house, mainly because I had a past experience helping an out-of-town friend find an apartment, and it ended not well at all. Current friend wanted to know why it didn't end well. It was a lot of things about criteria not matching up and also me not seeing bad things she had to live with, in the 10 minutes I took to look around. Friend replies ""that wouldn't be your responsibility."" I didn't reply, but thought it was just weird to not give me any responsibilities but also ask for my honest opinion.

The underlying reason is - WHY SHOULD I HELP YOU SHOP FOR YOUR FOREVER HOME FOR YOU AND YOUR BABY. She posts on facebook about how much she wants to find a house with a big yard so her kid can play. I had no desire to help her find these things.

She knows we've been trying with no luck. I never sat her down and told her to educate herself on IF, but I might have to. 

Because I refused to help her select a house, she is flying down next week with her BF to look in person. She did ask if she could stay with us while she looks for 4 days. Maybe in this time period I could have a talk with her.

I am so glad to find this community. I am 29, and have been trying for about 4 years. I've never been pregnant (to my knowledge). I did see an RE a few years ago but stopped after initial testing due to academic constraints. This time, my labwork has come back normal but I have irregular cycles. I am currently on letrazole and had my HSG today. There are a lot of stories about HSGs (often negative) so I figured I'd share my experience. I was especially worried because I had a LEEP 10 years ago, so was wondering if scar tissue would be a concern.

The worst part (as some others have said) was the anticipation. It felt like there were several steps and hours of waiting, although I was only there for about an hour total. They had my put on two gowns and socks, and stow my clothes in a locker. Then I had to wait again. Once I was called back, they had me step on the table (kind of nerve wracking, because it felt fairly high up). The RE explained the procedure briefly and then I laid back. She inserted the speculum (never much of an issue for me) and then engaged me in brief small talk while inserting the catheter, which didn't hurt at all. When the dye was going in, I felt a lot of pressure and crampiness, but it was over within seconds. I did not have any blockage and only feel very light cramps now. For what it's worth, my menstrual cramps are often very painful.

So I just had a saline ultrasound (aka sonohysterogram), trial transfer, and FemVue (blast of air through tubes) a few weeks ago and I wanted to share my experience. Before I had it done I was googling and I came across some horror stories. Here's my experience.

I was told to have a full bladder. 24-36 oz of water before the procedure were my specific instructions. I had an hour drive to get to my RE. I peed right before I left the house and sipped on about half of a 16 oz water bottle on the drive there. I had drank OJ and ate cereal before I left as well. Pulled in to the RE lot 45 minutes later and I had to pee! Bad! Haha. Good thing I didn't follow their instructions! I sat in the waiting room for maybe 10 minutes and got called back. I was early, so I expected the wait. First I had a normal ""wanda"" ultrasound. Then once that was over with the doctor came in for the trail transfer, SHG, and FemVue to check my tubes. Vaginal ultrasound was uncomfortable because I had to pee, trial transfer was fairly easy and painless.  Worst part was the speculum because I had a full bladder. By the way, my measley 8 or so oz of water was a nice, full bladder! 

Trial transfer was over and then came the saline. The doctor left the catheter in from the trial transfer. Something went wrong after they squirted the saline in and the catheter fell out. Yay! So we had to insert the speculum and a new catheter all over again! Very minimal cramping once the saline went in. Low key period cramps. Then came the air bubbles, again more cramping. Cramps weren't painful really. Just there. All in all the procedure was uncomfortable with an assortment of tools down there, but nothing painful. Tubes were clear (WHEW I was in shock! nothing for 4 years I surely expected blocked tubes), uterus looked good, and I was on my way to bathroom within 10 minutes and extremely relieved about the results. Took 3 Advil an hour before the procedure. Also took antibiotic before and again that night.

I had a 45 minute or so drive home. Had cramps maybe 15 minutes of that and by 20 minutes in I felt well enough to stop at the grocery store and shop. 

All and all it was simple and quick. However, what happened the following week was not what I expected. I felt extremely gassy for at least 4 days. Also the morning after the sonohysterogram I woke up and was light headed and ended up on the floor until I ate (possibly had no connection and it's happened after other medical procedures too) I am typically very regular and pooped right before I went for the SHG because I was nervous about my tubes being blocked. I didn't poop normally again for a week and a day. Why? I have no idea. Everything felt tight and gassy. It hurt to try and push. Similar to exaggerated ovulation pains for days. It was frustrating!

After 4 years of trying, I eventually started IVF. I've done three unsuccessful fresh rounds. I make terrible embryos. I've had a grand total of 1 blastocyst, even though I've retrieved 51 eggs. They just don't make it. 

But I specifically wanted to make a post about cramping and IVF. Every round I have had terrible cramping after I start the progesterone. It is worst after the transfer and then continues until I stop the progesterone and start my period. I took Valium last transfer and it gave temporary relief and then came right back. It is not associated with implantation. It's like my uterus is irritated.

Do you think this would prevent implantation? I realise they were probably bad embryos as well but I'm worried that if I get a good one that it won't have a hope. I can't keep doing this. It hurts too much (emotionally and physically). My RE doesn't seem to blink an eye when I mention it.

I don't even know who my new doc will be and if it will be an issue or not but it just drives me nuts that those using reproductive technology or adopting are held to a higher standard than those who just get knocked up, who have zero standards to meet.

Also I told her about my 10dpo progesterone level which was .91.  She said that's evidence that I didn't ovulate and it's probably my diet. I just feel like she dismissed us completely for being overweight. I'm 5'7 230lbs and my husband is 6'0 280lbs. So yes obviously we need to be healthier but I'm so pissed that this is all she wanted to talk about.

I had to bring up my husbands SA where he has borderline motility and my VERY short Luteul Phase (9days usually). We were also able to see the results of the HSG after I insisted that the results had been sent over and it turns out I don&#39;t have a Uterine Septum. So hooray no surgery. Also I told her about my 10dpo progesterone level which was .91.  She said that&#39;s evidence that I didn&#39;t ovulate and it&#39;s probably my diet. I just feel like she dismissed us completely for being overweight. I&#39;m 5&#39;7 230lbs and my husband is 6&#39;0 280lbs. So yes obviously we need to be healthier but I&#39;m so pissed that this is all she wanted to talk about.  I told her I wanted to be more aggressive and I wasn&#39;t content to go on a crash diet and keep trying for several more months.

I have been under the care of a functional medicine doctor for other issues, and between her tests and my OBGYN's, all looks good and normal on the hormone front. I use OPKs and temp and both indicate that I'm ovulating, with a normal luteal phase. 

With all my good test results, I was finally able to get my husband tested. He recently had 2 SAs about 2 weeks apart. The volume was too low on the first one - just .7ml - so they were unable to give us a count or motility. Volume was 2ml on the second one, and the results were worse. Semen viscosity was ""increased"" and liquefaction was ""abnormal"". As far as motility, the note says ""Unable to perform test. Too few sperm present. Rare motile sperm seen."" Appearance, volume, and pH were all normal. 

We got these results from his primary care doc on Friday, simply emailed with no follow-up notes - I couldn't believe it. How hard is it to make a phone call to deliver such bad news? When asked follow-up questions, the doctor punted and suggested two fertility clinics near us (neither of which has a urologist on staff, according to their websites). Since then, I have been vacillating from devastated to afraid to angry. 

ART is off the table for us, so I'm praying that there's something that can be done to improve his sperm health so we can conceive naturally. I am cautiously optimistic that that might be the case. My husband is a daily cannabis user and used to drink quite a bit - he has cut back on that in the past month or so. He hasn't smoked any weed since getting these results, and I think he finally understands that yes, he actually must make lifestyle changes.

My Dr told us last time he thinks immunological issues are a waste of time (killer cells, etc) as he is super fact based and says the research isn&#39;t there. I&#39;ve never had any reason to believe I have endo and my dr firmly believes that diagnostic laproscopy is not worth it as IVF should bypass endo. I&#39;ve come across a few things - ERA and Receptiva being the most interesting. What is everyone&#39;s experience? What are our other options? Are his opinions well accepted? Any advice much appreciated. </p>

Freezing embryos was strongly suggested. 


Thought I would let you lovely people know that you were bang on. 

SO and I have spent the past months getting tested. Waiting to get the results was somewhat stressful, but yesterday we were given the go ahead to start planning retrieval and embryo freezing. Which is great news for us :) 

Day-to-day life is no longer a choice between his health and our potential future family... I'm completely exhausted as years of tension and stress are dissolving away. I won't get my hopes up, nothing is certain, but thank you all for helping me to find hope again. It's easy to feel doomed when caring for your SO and I hadn't felt hope about our future in a long time. 

He's going through some treatment over the next months so our next appointment isn't until end of November. A little bit of light at the end of the 2017 to look forward to :) 

Thank you. 



And for those in Australia, we are using one of the new bulk billing IVF clinics ('bulk billing' is when medical fees are paid directly by Medicare, our national health insurance). I didn't know they existed and it has saved us many monies - for what seemed to my (IVF novice but biomedical scientist) eyes to be fairly comprehensive screening tests across my cycle, testing for SO, and our first two appointments (which are with specialist GPs), we are only out of pocket for my AMH blood work. The clinic is also very reasonably priced for retrieval and implantation cycles, and for freezing (only embryos though). It was made very clear that we were welcome to take the bulk billed test results somewhere fancier and more expensive for the next stage if we so wanted. If finances are a barrier for any other Aussies, these clinics might be worthwhile to consider for some/all of the process.

As with any bulk billing service though, the doctors have been a bit miss and hit (in that order). The first literally asked my SO if he had considered getting a job he enjoys as a way to improve his functioning, because ""once you're in the flow of doing something enjoyable then you have more energy""... such a slap in the face, but said with genuine empathy and the doc did their job of ordering all the tests we needed so we let it go. The second doctor was truly wonderful though - unexpectedly knowledgeable about SO's weird medical condition, generous with their time, and went out of their way to support us in terms of our individual circumstances.

A bit of background: trying for about 3 years with two pregnancies of unknown location (both suspected ectopic). HSG showed damaged tubes, so was diagnosed with tubal factor and headed to IVF. Before getting started, I miscarried a spontaneous and surprisingly uterine pregnancy this May at 6.5 weeks. We started IVF at the end of June.


I’ve had consistently solid results in testing (AMH 4.2, FSH 7.6, AFC ~20) so my RE was optimistic and set me on an antagonist protocol with freeze all for PGS testing. I responded poorly for my numbers, though. My AFC was 18 but estrogen was low on stims day 3 and my follicle count kept dropping. They cranked me up to what they said was max stims (2 vials menopur, 450 Gonal-F) and wound up retrieving 8 eggs, 7 mature, 6 fertilized, 4 still going on day 3, 2 made it to biopsy and freeze. I was feeling good about those numbers with my readjusted expectations, but then we got the PGS results on Monday: 1 aneuploid and 1 mosaic, FET cancelled.


We had our meeting with the RE yesterday and he said his next move would be a microdose lupron flare protocol starting with BCP. If I respond similarly poorly, he’d be inclined to recommend donor eggs or embryos after that point. At the very least, we’re going to take a few months off to regroup and get our finances together for another cycle (we’re entirely out of pocket). I’m going to go on CoQ10, clean up my diet, and throw in all of the acupuncture/yoga/whatever I can if this is our last shot with my eggs. I also may seek out some second opinions. I’m kind of swimming in all of this because it’s so unexpected. What could cause AMH and FSH to be good but actual ovarian reserve to be not so good? Does the microdose flare protocol seem like the way to go?

Had my first bloodwork and ultrasound done today after starting stimming. The nurse said my bloodwork looks good, my follicles are coming in, and the RE wants to up my Gonal-f to 225 IU from 150 IU. I feel normal. Had a horrible headache half the day today which was very unpleasant since I was at work. But I don't think that's cuz of these injections, probably just an off day. 

The injections aren't nearly as bad as my mind made them out to be (OF COURSE) and while they are a little uncomfortable going in, it's nothing to be worried about. First time I did the injection thought I felt really crummy afterward. I don't know if it was because I psyched myself out and I had all this nervous energy or what but I was a little clammy, nauseated, grumpy, etc. Only lasted about 30 mins. 


Anyways, that's my update. Hope everyone is doing well and that y'all are getting good news left and right!! 




**Original Post**

Hello everyone! I'm all anxious and have nobody to talk to about this so I wanted to come on here and share that I'll be starting my ""stimming"" today. This is my first cycle of IVF. I've had 3 failed Femara cycles and 2 failed Clomid cycles. All of them were timed intercourse and we did one IUI on the last try because I requested it. My husband and I have been TTC for about 3 years now. My RE seems pretty convinced this IVF is what will work for me and my husband so, fingers crossed. 


I'm 28 and my husband is 35. We'll both be turning a year older here in the next 2 months though. I went out last night to Michaels to buy a Latchmate tote thing to store all my medication/injections in. It helped to ease my anxieties a touch. I think it was someone on this subreddit that shared that tip about the Latchmate tote so, thank you! 


At this point I have unexplained infertility. It's a scary thought because at the start of all this the RE said I just had annovulatory PCOS. Anyone else starting or started stims recently??

It is not to be read as a manifesto or anything, but this is how I feel and I wanted to share it with you. I think that since this community is committed to supporting each other, this is the best place where to share. I will be happy to hear your views and receive your input on the matter.
Here we go:


""We are talking a lot about mental health and how you can help people cope when they are having a hard moment in life. However, when you find yourself in need of support you realise that most of the people really have no clue on how to be empathetic and supportive. Don't get me wrong, they probably think they are helping you, but really they are just causing you more pain and hurt when you are already extremely fragile. That's why most of the people struggling with depression and emotional pain (yes, guys it is a thing) detach from the rest of the world. It is not just in their head that they feel isolated and misunderstood. 

Then when something really bad happens, I often hear friends and family say: ""S/he should have called me"" or ""I always made time for listening to her/him"" or even ""I didn't know s/he was hurting so bad, s/he always seemed so happy and on top of everything!"". 

Well, guys maybe we decided to be isolated because we felt we needed to protect ourselves from you, from the feeling of having to deal with the additional pain that your lack of tact was causing us. 
That's why we keep the happy mask on, it is for our mutual benefit, you don't have to help and we don't have to cope with your inability to help.

And then, when two souls who are deeply hurting meet each other, they don't even have to say anything. They know, they understand, they feel the same. Hands are squeezed, glances and wobbly smiles are exchanged and the soothing feeling of healing ourselves and the other person begins. It is a closed community, that is a fact. Elective members only.

Mr Pops and I are both 33, living in Melbourne Australia, I've been off birth control since 2013, but we were using the fuckit method of conception (if it happens it happens) until we got married in June 2015 when I was so ready to start for reals but he wasn't prepared to actually TRY yet, so officially we've been trying since first Anniversary (June 2016). I'd been seeing a Gyn trying to sort out my cycles since 2015 and in November 2015 I had lap band surgery at her suggestion (and a whole lot of soul searching of my own) as I'm quite obese, at my first appointment with her she said 'I can get you pregnant but let's work on your weight first'. She diagnosed me with polycycstic ovaries, but probably not the syndrome and was always content to do a couple of blood tests and see me in another 6 months. I think I successfully ovulated once that I know of.
 In January this year, I had a bad visit with an endocrinologist who told me I was pre-diabetic with no other indicators except my weight, all my bloods were good, and then she tried to push a new to market injectable weight loss hormone thing on me, despite the fact I went to her for thyroid advice. Mu GP had played with my dose of thyroxine and it had messed with my cycle, my weight loss (which was going well, and I have since plateaued, gah) and given me other hyperthyroid symptoms.
Her advice was that what the GP said was fine and tried reeeeeeally hard to convince me to do the injections, with the added bonus of not being able to get pregnant until after treatment was over, callously saying 'you'd just have to use condoms' and finishing it by saying 'it's not safe for you to get pregnant anyway so what will this hurt?'
So I was venting to my aunt who was stuck in the local women's hospital waiting out the end of a successful IVF pregnancy (after 5+ years of failed attempts, and two miscarriages) who suggested I get referred to the reproductive clinic at this hospital so I would have to see a Gyn for one thing, a endo for another thing and my GP for the rest. In the mean time I'd been charting, doing OPKs which were always negative, timed intercourse and all the usual diy things, so I finally asked my GP for a referral to the clinic. 
I went for my first appointment in March with all my results and letters, I was assessed by an RE, because of my no ovulation and the fact that I was doing all I could to lose weight, I given a script for clomid and sent on my way. I got a massive period on day 19 so he got me to do the day 21 bloods as planned and said it failed and I needed to come in for an ultrasound. Again I was told to start clomid right then (maybe on day 9) and I got the same crazy period on day 19 so I still did the 21 day bloods with no ovulation again. They got me to come in for another ultrasound and I made my Mr Pops come this time because the waiting room is full of pregnant women or women with new babies and/or children running around and I needed support. At this appointment they say I need a hysteroscopy and d&c because my lining was really thick and book me in asap. I wasn't worried about anything because up until this point no one has been worried, just keep telling me it'll happen, just relax, wait it out... helpful.
I had had a General Anaesthetic in early May for a repair to my lap band, and then the d&c was booked for three weeks later and I seriously struggled with the second GA, it took me two weeks to get any energy back, and I got bonus antibiotics and pelvic ultrasound after a week because they were concerned my recovery was taking too long and I might have an infection.
So I called to ask for results, I was told they'd call me, but they wouldn't do them over the phone, and gave me an appointment for 8 weeks post procedure (!). But then I got a revised one for 4 weeks and I was still oblivious to where this was heading. Hubby had done an SA which came back mostly positive, and he's been given another to do, but hasn't done it yet.
I went in on June 21 with my hubby and felt nervous, but just assumed they would send me home with clomid again, I had a list of questions, which went out of the window when they told me I was been diagnosed with Endometrial Hyperplasia with Atypia. It's a pre-cancerous condition which is usually diagnosed in women after menopause and treatment is a hysterectomy. For younger women who want to 'preserve fertility' (lovely) the only option is Mirena IUD for 6 months and hope that it resolves itself in that time. The progesterone in the IUD should suppress any potential cancer that could be present (it can be missed at initial diagnosis). I have been all over the internet getting to understand the mechanics of what's gone wrong, and I'm here is where I landed.
So that's where I'm at, waiting until December to have the IUD removed and then waiting a cycle to let my body to its thing and I'll have another d&c to test if it's gone in January.
I have been suddenly thrown into Schrodinger's infertility, where depending on results in January I will be doing either IVF (recommended due to me never ovulating on my own), further treatment (IUD) again, stimulation to do egg retrieval in preparation for a hysterectomy, or straight to hysterectomy if it's really bad. Add to that Schrodinger's cancer, whereby if when they do the hysterectomy there's a 5-20% chance it's already in there. 
Wow, that's a long post (thanks for reading).
Is there anyone else here with a similar diagnosis? I'm really hoping to hear from people who have managed the hyperplasia side of things are have been able to proceed with treatment, at this point I am terrified that when I get my next results they'll say it's all over and my journey ends here.",t2_934wdi6,False,,0,False,My Intro -Endometrial Hyperplasia,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_6ragg6,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1501769954.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So I thought I should do my introduction, I found this subreddit about a week ago and I think I qualify.

My husband and I recently discovered after TTC for one year that I have diminished ovarian reserve. We just met with our RE today after failing to be able to try Fumera two months in a row due to cysts I developed. She is starting me on injectables this month and I think IUI. 

My AMH is 0.02. I am in my mid thirties. My husband and I always wanted children and are now trying to plan our uncertain future and deal with the stress and cost of IF treatment. In the past I have had problems with depression and anxiety, I tend to disconnect from others during those times, it can be very difficult for me to interact with people when I am depressed and I am older now so I manage the symptoms a bit better, lots of self care and funny movies, etc. 

I have a friend who I will call A. A is younger than I am and diagnosed as bipolar. She is intelligent and funny and a ball of energy. She tends to dominate conversations and has a lot of drama in her life at all times, usually this doesn't really bother me and I am able to see it as just the way she is. This past month, however, she was freaking out about some things and kept calling and I felt overwhelmed and didn't answer several calls in a row. I did continue to see her at work but I was honestly pretty quiet. I had tried talking to her about our issues and she was sympathetic but would cut me off or suddenly need to get off the phone (after spending twenty minuetes talkng about herself). I just decided she wasn't in a place to provide a ton of support and stopped answering her calls for a bit. Now she is very angry with me and has ended our friendship, I explained that I am sorry that I disconnected but that we have been very stressed with everything going on. She countered with all the things wrong in her life, mentioned that she is suicidal over how bad it all is and that she needed a friend and I was completely in the wrong. I know I tend to 'drop off' on people when I am going through depression, I feel bad about it but it feels like a survival instinct. I can only handle so much during those times and I am unable to take meds due the fact that we are still trying. Am I in the wrong here? Also, if I could repair this relationship, should I? She is very high maintenance and I feel selfish but maybe this is a good time to take a break. I don't think I can handle all of her stress as well as my own. I offered to take a walk once a week with her and chat about everything going on in both of our lives but she stated that she was ending our friendship. I don't know how to feel about it all and wanted an outside perspective from those dealing with this stuff. Thanks.

<p>My AMH is 0.02. I am in my mid thirties. My husband and I always wanted children and are now trying to plan our uncertain future and deal with the stress and cost of IF treatment. In the past I have had problems with depression and anxiety, I tend to disconnect from others during those times, it can be very difficult for me to interact with people when I am depressed and I am older now so I manage the symptoms a bit better, lots of self care and funny movies, etc. </p>

<p>I have a friend who I will call A. A is younger than I am and diagnosed as bipolar. She is intelligent and funny and a ball of energy. She tends to dominate conversations and has a lot of drama in her life at all times, usually this doesn&#39;t really bother me and I am able to see it as just the way she is. This past month, however, she was freaking out about some things and kept calling and I felt overwhelmed and didn&#39;t answer several calls in a row. I did continue to see her at work but I was honestly pretty quiet. I had tried talking to her about our issues and she was sympathetic but would cut me off or suddenly need to get off the phone (after spending twenty minuetes talkng about herself). I just decided she wasn&#39;t in a place to provide a ton of support and stopped answering her calls for a bit. Now she is very angry with me and has ended our friendship, I explained that I am sorry that I disconnected but that we have been very stressed with everything going on. She countered with all the things wrong in her life, mentioned that she is suicidal over how bad it all is and that she needed a friend and I was completely in the wrong. I know I tend to &#39;drop off&#39; on people when I am going through depression, I feel bad about it but it feels like a survival instinct. I can only handle so much during those times and I am unable to take meds due the fact that we are still trying. Am I in the wrong here? Also, if I could repair this relationship, should I? She is very high maintenance and I feel selfish but maybe this is a good time to take a break. I don&#39;t think I can handle all of her stress as well as my own. I offered to take a walk once a week with her and chat about everything going on in both of our lives but she stated that she was ending our friendship. I don&#39;t know how to feel about it all and wanted an outside perspective from those dealing with this stuff. Thanks. EDIT spelling</p>

Option one onviously has much longer suppression times- this is to align with the cycle batching the clinic does. To counter this, the doctor plans on prescribing more stims to negate the long suppression times.

This choice was largley presented in terms of costs: that I would have to pay for an approximate additional 150 units of FSH medication per day.

This means the cost for medications would go from being 4500$ to a potential  high of $5300.

It's been several years since I've had one rupture, so I'd forgotten that I've had these pains before! I'm about 90% sure that was exactly what it was. Things are feeling much better today. Still a little sore, but definitely getting better. 


**I know you're not doctors and can't diagnose me. I do plan to call my doctor in the morning if I'm still symptomatic**, I just want to see what others have experienced in the mean time...

Coming out of lurking on this sub to ask this: I took Ovidrel for the first time on Saturday (today is Monday) after a round of 7.5mg Letrozole. I had 2 mature follicles at the time of the trigger.

I woke up this morning feeling like there was a ton of pressure (almost like muscle spasms or swelling) around my bladder and uterus (basically my whole lower abdomen and pelvic region).  This afternoon I also have some mild lower back pain and slight muscle/joint fatigue/pain.

Some of these symptoms feel like a bladder infection is described, except for the lack of burning or feeling of urgency.  I know ""lower abdominal and pelvic pain"" is one of the common side effects, but it's such a vague description. 

Have any of you experienced bladder infection like symptoms after taking Ovidrel? How long did it take to go away? I just really really hate the idea of taking an antibiotic during my first real two week wait, but I know with the increased encounter with intercourse, there is also an increased risk for a BI or UTI. 

Thoughts or experiences with your own trigger shots?

Ok so since some of you guys and girls asked for updates on my situation, I had some good news : I went to the doctor the other day, where he checked all my exams and told me two cool things.

1/ It seems that I can reduce the tumor only with medication. I am going to take this hormonal treatment twice a week and in six months I will have to do all the exams again to see if the tumor reduced well. If it does, no surgery !

2/ I asked him again about the infertility stuff and he said that I didn't understand (language issues), that the chances of me getting pregnant someday were close to zero IF I DIDN'T TAKE ANY TREATMENT. With medication, though, the odds are getting better.

The bad news, now : he also told me that for my body to get back to normal it would take two to three years. Two to three years of hormones, regular check-ups, exams, non-regular periods and medication.

But well, seeing this sub and the hell some of you are going through, I think I can make it.
I will tell my family about it today if I can.
Thank you so much for the support people ! You really helped me the other time, I was in a very bad place.

297,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Back to this forum again! (*sarcastic yay*). Not sure if this is the right place for this question but it's a lot more active forum than /r/miscarriage (I mean who wants to hang out there, this is way better right) and I figure a lot of women here have gone through this before here, multiple times. 

I had over 2.5 years of infertility trying naturally but conceived recently from my 4th IUI, and have now found out it's inviable (no heartbeat and measuring 6w2d when I was 7w2d).  I have no sign of miscarrying naturally anytime soon - not a single drop of blood. I also conceived from my 1st IUI and that ended in a missed miscarriage at 12.5 weeks (growth stopped 8.5 weeks).  For that one, I was also offered both options but D&C was the obvious choice because (1) my husband was working outside the country at the time and I would be alone, and (2) I was just way too far along (the pregnancy kept developing long after fetal death and I was even showing) so it would undoubtedly be more on the horror story side of things, and (3) it was my first loss and I was beyond freaked out.

Now I'm very confused what to do, because my husband is here, I'm not as far gestated (will be 8w0d when I will make the decision, just waiting a bit and getting one final ultrasound to be extra sure later this week), and while I was scared about scarring mainly after I got the first one (they really downplayed the risk to me at the hospital), I now have legitimate reason to believe I will only have more losses, and would like to reserve the D&C for later losses where using misoprostol would be worse.

Pros with D&C:

- physically easy (I had zero pain and very little bleeding last time - and I enjoy general anesthesia. I'm pretty scared of going through labor on misoprostol based on the widely varying internet stories out there, and they are sure to not give me real pain meds here, just paracetamol)

- over with quickly

- could potentially have faster HCG drop and get back to normal quicker - I'm not getting any younger and time is of the essence, and I'll be waiting to start my first IVF cycle

Cons with D&C:

- risk of scarring, especially with the fact I now have to face that this will most likely not be my last miscarriage

I didn't seem to have much trouble conceiving by IUI after my first D&C, so I assume adhesions were not a factor (I think? Can they contribute to additional losses after conception?), but I don't know if having a second or third somehow compounds the risk of scarring over the first and second, etc. 

Any advice or suggestions as to what I should do?  I keep going back and forth in my head over it and maybe I just need to hear some reassuring stories about misoprostol.  I did actually take misoprostol (although I think a pretty low amount relative to what's taken for doing the full thing) before my D&C. Long story short, it was ridiculously effective at that point (and I only took it once I got to the hospital early) because I already started miscarrying naturally the morning of the procedure, and some very light contractions started but I went under for the D&C before anything really got going so didn't experience the rest.  Plus everything in me was suddenly ready to fall out by the time I took it, which won't be the case now.

UPDATE: Turns out I don't think I can even opt for a D&C when I'm at this gestation here, no choice but misoprostol! (unless I try it first and it fails). 8 week scan of course confirmed again that nothing has happened, my clinic gave me the pills - so I just took a first oral dose of 400 mg (I think this is just to soften things up since I have zero bleeding yet) and start on the vaginal pills tomorrow morning. Will update again what my experience ends up being.  Only have paracetamol and ibuprofen (I bought some OTC codeine in case I get desperate but the only thing available is 500 mg aspirin + 9.6 mg codeine which is like...nothing).  Male doctors are telling me I don't need anything except this...mhm we'll see.

We have our first RE appointment coming up on Tuesday and I'm wondering what to expect. Earlier this week we were given news that my husbands SA came with zero sperm and told we should see a urologist. We decided to move to a RE and are assuming we'll be told the same about the urologist but we're hoping to get a recommendation of one from the RE.

We've been trying for 7 months so literally the only testing we've done is the SA. I'm working on gathering all our medical records but they're pretty boring at this point - a few years worth of normal Pap results for me and just general check up's/physicals for my husband. I haven't been to a general physician in a few years as I didn't have a need. 

Has anyone seen an RE with barely any testing before? I'm not sure if we should expect just a lengthy conversation and a referral to a urologist or if I should mentally prepare for an ultrasound/blood work/etc. I hate needles so the sooner I can start calming myself about them the better 😜 

I have pretty regular periods and have been off birth control since November 2016. I plan to bring my printed Fertility Friend charts. According to OPK's and temping, I'm ovulating each month. I've never had any health issues but I'm assuming I'll have some testing at some point, right? 

The health history paperwork we have to fill out is so lengthy and we both have to have the awkward conversation with our parents about our situation this weekend. Both sets of parents knew we were casually trying but thought we were taking more of a ""if it happens, it happens"" approach. Im sure they'll both be caught off guard by hearing 1. We had a SA done and 2. Hubs may or may not have sperm 😑 We need answers from them about family health history so we'll have to break the news to them unfortunately. Hoping they don't continue to pry regularly because we both would prefer to keep this process pretty quiet for now. We're still unsure how open we're willing to be with friends/family, especially when we don't even know what's going to be our game plan.

 My brother married really young, like 18 years young, and within a couple of months, they got pregnant. The pregnancy was rocky and their marriage was worse. Fast forward 7 months and the vessel (I refuse to call her a mother) abandons her 7-month-old child and her husband. She stays gone for 10 months without any visit to her daughter. She moves out of state to be with her sister who is an escort and her brother who is in a gang and does drugs. She parties every night and calls my brother drunk off of her ass at 2 in the morning crying about how much she loves him and wants him back. My brother filed for custody and all of a sudden this bitch realizes that she has a daughter and decides to fight back. After months of visitation with the baby refusing to go with the bitch and having nightmares, we finally had court today. The baby turns two years old next month. My parents, brother, sisters, and I are all she knows. She knows who to go to if she wants a snack and which aunt gives the best bubble baths. She knows that whenever I visit I always have a treat for her, usually a sweet. She knows that grandpa is her ""papa"" and she knows that she has him wrapped around her pinky. She knows that she is the light that guides our lives. 
 After being gone for 15 months the vessel is fighting for joint custody. She cried in court today, claiming that my brother beat her and she feared for her life which was why she left. The question is why didn't she take the baby with her if her life was so scary? I have never seen my brother lay a hand on her. I've seen her slap him countless number of times because he did something she thought was stupid. I have seen her beat herself and claim that my brother did it to her. I've seen her mentally and emotionally abuse him yet today in court he was the monster. And guess what my friends. The judge believed her. Because the bitch knows how to tell a story and cry. She knows how to play the victim. She knows that because she is a ""mother"" the courts are going to be more sympathetic to her. 
Even after being gone for the last 15 months and even though her daughter doesn't recognize her as her mother, she is going to get daily visitation with overnights guaranteed in a month. 
HOW THE FUCK IS THIS FAIR?!!!!!!!!!
Forget about how I feel or how my family feels, how is that innocent baby going to feel. She can't sleep without my mother singing her a lullaby and she refuses to sleep without her ""papa"" playing with her hair. She's going to think that we just left her, that we just gave her to this monster who is nothing more than an egg donor. Her vessel bitch ass disgraceful excuse for a mother already abandoned her once, she is no doubt going to do it again. Why must that baby suffer so this disgusting excuse of a human being can play ""mother"" and just leave her again when she gets bored and decides that she ""wants to live her life without any restraints"". How is it fair that she was blessed with a miracle and countless women who actually deserve children cry themselves to sleep every night because they can't have kids. How is it fair that she leaves for 15 months and now gets joint custody? How is it fair that she wanted to have an abortion when she found out she was pregnant, yet I can't even get pregnant even after 16 months of trying? How is it that women who are willing to move heaven and earth in order to have a child are tortured when worthless scum like this BITCH are just handed everything on a silver platter?  How is it fair, that just because she gave birth to a child she is considered a mother? She has no maternal bone in her body. She is narcissistic, cruel, and evil. There is a special place in hell reserved for her and anyone that believed her garbage.  FUCK HER AND FUCK ALL WORTHLESS EXCUSES OF WOMEN WHO HAVE CHILDREN YET DON'T DESERVE THE HONOR OF BEING MOTHERS.

The End...not really because damn it hurts and it isn't fair. She best pray that she doesn't hurt that little angel or there will be hell to pay. Come hell or high water, that bitch will pay if she hurts a hair on that baby's head.

One mention of menopause in passing, and one comment about if the OP died. One sentence about congenital birth issues. I hope this covers everything that might upset anyone. If I need to add tags or anything, I will happily do so, or update the warning if anyone thinks I missed something.


I definitely don't want anyone to feel more upset, since if you are here, you probably have some feelings to begin with. Only one unspoken moment involving a pregnant family member, but I will not dwell on it or spell it out, aside from just saying it happened.    

So, the first thing is facts: I'm 31, my husband is 29. We're coming up on our 11th anniversary. We have been trying to get pregnant for more than a decade at this point. We both really wanted children more than almost anything.

Second thing, complications: we don't have health insurance. We live in the US, and we simply can't afford it. Even if we could it wouldn't cover any sort of treatment for IF. We don't have enough income to try expensive reproductive therapy or intervention. We don't have family or friends that are in any position to help us (the only living relatives we have contact with are on my husband's side and it's his 80+ grandmother who is filling for her like third bankruptcy next month) and we don't live in any state that offers any scholarship/treatment assistance/grant money. Our financial future is pretty much the same as it was when we got married and isn't going to change any time soon. We can't adopt. We are definitely not able to move or find better jobs. My husband has a history of congenital birth issues, which only increase in pregnancy rates after pregnancy at age 30-35.

This last part is just the venting.    

I am so utterly fed up. We really thought everything was going to just work out, like I'm sure most newlyweds do. At first. After the first year of actively trying, I scraped together $84 and went to the local women's clinic (sliding scale) and they did the normal pap smear and exam and said everything was fine from what they could see, and said if it hadn't happened in another year I could try to come back and they would check/test again. My husband went to try to donate sperm, to get a free count/motility consult (one of the things they offer at a place near us) and they couldn't find any issues. So we went back to trying.

We tried for the second and third years, nothing. Not even a missed period. My cycle was always super regular and I charted and temperatured like my life depended on it. We tried to make another Dr appointment, at the end of the third year, but they had changed their billing practices and we could no longer afford it. Then the unthinkable happened, his 15 year old cousin came home and had a great big announcement (you can guess I'm sure) and my heart just shattered. It felt like I was being mocked. By her, by the universe, just everything. She came back with a second announcement a year later, and at that point I just stopped speaking to that entire branch of the family. Like no contact, pretend they no longer exist, rendition-style excision.

We were in year 5 at that point, desperate and sad and I was just the lowest I've ever been in my life, up to that point. We couldn't even find out what was wrong (if anything) and whatever we were doing was not working. We are both really stubborn and decided that nothing else mattered, we were going to keep doing what everyone suggested, apps on our phones, charts, Xcel spreadsheets, diet changes, sleeping patterns, no alcohol/drugs/smoking/caffeine, etc. We talked about trying to just order sperm over the internet (and max out our only credit card) just to see if that would work! But in the end I couldn't picture not knowing who the father of my child was, or really even knowing it was anyone other than the person I had chosen to be my mate, if that makes sense. Having a baby was really, really important, but having a baby with my husband turned out to be even more vital to us than we would have thought.

We kept that brutal, rigid, almost monastic plan for 3 years. We were in hell. We fought about everything, we still loved each other an insanely huge amount and we both felt like complete failures. About three years ago (roughly married for 8 years at that point) we gave up on trying to kill ourselves, thinking maybe the stress was getting in the way. We stopped ""trying"" since that was yet another internet suggestion, ""it will happen when you give up!""

Which brings me to today. It still hasn't happened. About 3 months ago, there was a change. My period suddenly went from being clockwork to being weird and irregular, coming once every 2-3 months. My normal ovulation cycle, again clear obvious ovulation that you could set your watch by is now odd and random. I'm genuinely beginning to wonder if I'm entering early menopause or something because I'm a hormonal mess some days, hot flashes randomly, almost like PMS, but not linked into my cycle in any meaningful way that I can see. We still don't know if there's any actual problems, we still have no way to find out and I'm terrified and so full of rage and I just don't know what to do next.

I still love my husband, he still loves me, we are definitely still on the same team and we both cry now whenever we have to see some stupid social media post about someone getting everything so easily. It's impossible for us to deal with the outside world half the time. We have no contact with his extended family (again for previously stated reasons) and we have, like, ONE friend who doesn't have a wife or anything to cause us pain. We hate going to work and we never go to social events. We are kind of introverted, so that's not the end of the world. But my husband has hobbies that he wants to pursue, and I encourage that, but I make it clear I'm not going. I just won't risk it anymore. I don't want to be reminded. I don't want it rubbed in my face. I don't want to think about how this was not supposed to be my life and I would give almost anything to fix this one problem.

I am definitely sorry for the whining, it's so not normally me, but today has just been a bit more than I can handle and I started hunting places to feel like I wasn't alone and I found this sub.

I hate knowing that it will probably never get resolved and I've already started saying things to my husband like ""Well, maybe you should get a girlfriend, at least that way one of us might have a kid!"" or even worse ""I certainly hope if I die you prescreen future wife material in advance! She should have the resources to deal with any potential problems or at least great health insurance!""

We both laugh about it, but I know it's painful for him to hear something like that, and I try to fight it off, but that bitterness just sinks in, right down to my bones and it feels like this lead weight now. I want to be with my husband forever, a long and happy life, I just don't know how to have a happy life that doesn't include the family we both wanted. ""Wanted"" doesn't even do that feeling justice, you know? We couldn't imagine life any other way.    

This whole decade, I don't think either of us ever gave up. We were always the best support for the other person, and we still are. I could not have picked a better life partner and I know he feels the same way (I just asked him, he confirms it) and I'm just so sad that I won't get to see him be the amazing parent I know he would be. I honestly think that is such a big part of this whole horrible situation, I feel bad for essentially keeping my soulmate from his life dream (because of course I internalize and think this has to be a ""me"" problem).

I have no idea what to do next. Do we give up completely? I definitely have no interest in sex right now (for the last 2 months, at least) since it seems there is zero purpose for my stupid reproductive organs. My husband is starting to feel the same way, often now joking about it by yelling at his genitals. At least we can still sort of laugh about it together, but we both have that slightly crazed look, ""But no really, what's the point of having these things if they don't work?"" I don't want this to make us hate each other or ourselves, I just don't know how else to cope with the overwhelming terror that comes crashing in every time I think about saying, ""Ok that's it, it's never going to happen, just quit trying, learn to be happy some other way, you total wreck of a human woman.""

I don't know if I'm alone in my feels, since I've literally never tried to discuss this with anyone other than my husband in the last 9 years. I just don't know what to do anymore and I don't know if I can accept doing nothing for the rest of my life.",t2_16shrg,False,,0,False,"Ok, very long post warning: mostly a vent, but any comments are welcome",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_6psmv5,False,dark,0.88,,public,13,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,13,,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1501146970.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Ok, first thank you for saying it was ok to post.    </p>

Thank you to anyone who is reading this :)
I have severe endometriosis and must conceive through IVF because of my low egg reserve as a result of many surgeries. I am single so I will be using donor sperm with my eggs. I have looked and looked and looked through countless donor websites and found one donor that was ""the one"". He is perfect but he is CMV positive. He does not have the active infection but had it at some point in his life so it is dormant and highly unlikely it would pass to the fetus. I got tested and I am CMV negative and have never been exposed to the virus. 

Has anyone had to make the decision to take the small risk choosing a CMV+ donor while being CMV negative? My DR says the risk for passing the infection is highly unlikely but there still is one. Is finding the perfect donor worth that risk? Help and and opinions are most definitely welcomed as this has been giving me tons of anxiety in this process which I am going through alone.
