Thank you all for the love, well wishes, and support for our transfer. It's killing me that we aren't telling my mom (she's pretty much my best friend), so having all of you cheer us on means the world!!  

The transfer went fairly smooth, although I think I overdid it on the water this morning. I had to pee SO BAD when we got there, and they were running about a half hour behind, so the nurse let me ""empty my bladder a little"" then checked it on the ultrasound and said ""Woah it's still really full."" By the time my RE and embryologist came in, I was in pain from having to pee so bad again so they let me run out really quick and empty some off again.  

Then, the RE had the speculum in and was nearly ready to go, and says ""Your bladder is still so full that it's pushing on the speculum. Do you want to go again? You have to be so uncomfortable"" so I jumped up and peed a third time (they gave me a cup and said fill this three times). Apparently my bladder magically refills instantaneously. It was the best pee of my life.  

He had a little trouble getting the catheter in, and the RE asked if I had a tilted uterus. I was like ""um...no...you've never said that..."" Apparently my bladder was still so full it was pushing on my uterus or something, so one nurse had to hold the ultrasound thing and one had to hold the speculum and push on it to get my uterus to become less tilted.  

Anyway, the actual transfer was surreal and went smoothly. It stuck a little in the catheter, but ended up getting out and where they wanted it in the end. They gave us pictures of our little blastocyst, too, which I think is super cool. I'm actually feeling really grateful and in awe of science today and all they can do, and that people care enough to help all of us with infertility try to have babies.    

I wore [these socks](http://www.earthtooldcity.com/product/its-a-beautiful-day-dont-fuck-it-up-mens-socks/) and my RE (thankfully!) thought they were hilarious. All the nurses bust out laughing, too. My RE was cracking up and took pictures of them, then played U2's ""Beautiful Day"" during the transfer, which got me all emotional because I love that song and because this is the closest we've gotten and because right now, at this moment, there is a little embryo in me and I want it to work so terribly bad.  

I've never seen my husband look so excited about anything, either. It was adorable. We got some Wendy's on the way home (we hardly ever eat fast food but it just sounded good), then I napped on the couch for 3 hours while he played video games.

My job is as a nurse, and we have to plan our schedules very far in advance for my job. We typically schedule 6-12 weeks out, and it can be difficult to get coverage/change shifts after that time. 

We are going to move forward with IVF, most likely starting stims last week of July. 

My question is, how ""affected"" did you feel by your stims? I know I will be on the antagonist protocol, starting with BC suppression the middle 2 weeks of July before starting with Gonal-F and then Ganirelix. My doctor anticipates I'll need about 10-12 days of stims for the retrieval, as I've responded well to the FSH for IUI cycles. 

Am I going to be able to like...work my shifts? I know this probably sounds like a silly question. Did you feel nauseated, or dizzy, or exceptionally tired while stimming? Could you imagine working 12 hour shifts with no problem, or should I ask for permission from my boss to change to only 8-hour shifts, or a limited schedule? 

I know there is no way to predict when the retrieval will be, nor is there a way to guess whether OHSS would develop. But how much recovery did you need after your ER? Similarly, how long after the average ER could you imagine needing off before returning to work a 12 hour shift in a busy ER? 

I'm basically trying to plan for something that is very difficult to plan for, and trying to decide whether I need to clue my boss in at this point or if I can somehow make this work.

I'm 27 and my obgyn believes I have POI. My FSH levels are high, my estrogen is low, while my AMH is 0.03. I wanted to ask a few questions for anybody else who has gone through this process. 

I've had an irregular period since I was 16. When I was 25 I had my first Pap smear and was told it was ASCUS and that it was fine and to come back in 3 years. I was also put on Mononessa. At 26 I got another Pap smear due to my anxiety about not having a satisfactory one. That one came back inconclusive. At 26 and 27 I have had 4 more and my last doctor said I don't have enough to cells to get results and recommended I use a hormonal cream to increase the cells. I wasn't ok with that, as it seemed like a bandaid for a bigger issue. I got a second opinion about a month ago and am so glad I did. 

I have Medicaid and am having difficulty finding a doctor who will give me a definite diagnosis so I can move forward and start treatment. Although having children hasn't been a priority in my life, I am starting to think about it, as something I may have wanted, or may want when I'm older. It sucks having the option taken away. But I digress, the issue is, is that Medicaid does not cover anything fertility related and although I'm not actively trying to have children at the moment, getting this diagnosis and receiving treatment is considered fertility related and have been told I need to see a reproductive endocrinologist. 

As far as I can tell, there are no RE's in the city that take my insurance and my obgyn recommends I see a plain endocrinologist and see if there is one who can diagnose me. Is this possible? 

I currently am using a Mirena IUD, and have been on Mononessa in the past, masking the fact that I have menstruation issues. I am thinking I should have this removed as I don't need it as a contraceptive, but it is hormonal and I'm worried taking it out will adversely affect me and my already low estrogen levels. 

I've been feeling fatigued for a few years now, and have had every testunder the sun and even a sleep study to figure it out. I've read low estrogen can cause fatigue, has anybody else experienced this?

It seems like being proactive about this has been the best way to get the ball rolling, I'm wondering what else I should do? Any more tests or things I could do for my health?


Thanks for listening to my long-winded post, it feels nice to talk about this with those who have understanding.

12,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Ok, as much as I want to go on a tangent I'm going to try to keep this as concise as possible. Let me start with some history about my cycle.

I started my period when I was 8 years old. My periods were always a nightmare from day one. They were extremely irregular. I had pain that was so severe that I went to the ER on multiple occasions. When I was a teen the dr. At the ER told my mom that she NEEDS to speak with my primary because I can't just keep coming into the ER for narcotics. My mom and I had ONE conversation with my primary (not an obgyn) regarding my pain. My primary told my mom she should put me on birth control, my mom was 100% against having her teen on birth control (it was too taboo for her) so my mom insisted on putting me on pain killers instead. The doctor refused to put me on a monthly prescription of narcotics. Soooo that's how that ended. I never got help for my pain and I never went to a doctor again for my issues (as a child). When I had my cramps from hell, my mom would let me stay home from school where I spent a week+ lying on the bathroom floor crying, puking, and literally wanting to put a bullet through my head. I tried to express my pain to others, my mom, my dad, my grandma, the school nurse. Everyone told me the same thing. ""What you're going through is normal. You're young and sometimes periods are just bad when you're young."" (Aka ""get over it"") and I believed them.

Fast forward a few years: A few weeks after I turned 18 I went to an obgyn for the first time where I requested to be on birth control (I was sexually active with my boyfriend, now husband and we were trying not to get pregnant). That day, I never really explained my history of painful periods to the obgyn. I didn't think It was important because everyone told me what I was going through was ""normal"". I was put on implanon. 

I was on implanon for three years. During the three years on implanon, my periods went away (for the most part) and so did my pain (for the most part). So I was a happy camper. My husband and I got married when I was 21, a few months later we decided to start trying to conceive. I got my implanon taken out.

The first couple of months off implanon were ok. I had cramps but they were tolerable. Every month up until now, the cramps got worse and worse. Last month I ended up back in the ER because once again, my cramps were so bad I literally wanted to kill myself. The nurse in the ER told me that my symptoms sound like endometriosis and that I should follow up with my obgyn within 2 days.

My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 10 months. We have tried EVERYTHING we both quit smoking, started eating better, had sex regularly, we take prenatals, I keep my legs up after sex, we tried the conceive+ lube, we didn't have sex during the two week wait, etc.. We're still not pregnant. I was starting to wonder if maybe my ""inability"" to conceive was related to my period pain. I did some research on endometriosis and saw symptoms listed that I actually have (but never knew could be related to each other) i.e. Pain during sex, reoccurring bladder infections, incontinence, extreme fatigue, ""killer cramps"", IBS-like symptoms. I was shocked/relieved because for the first time in my life I was starting to discover (what I always suspected) that maybe my pain wasn't ""normal"". Maybe I wasn't just ""over reacting"".

During my follow up with my obgyn, I expressed my concerns. I told her about everything, my history of painful periods, ER visits, my difficulty trying to conceive, my endometriosis-like symptoms etc. She literally laughed at me. She said I was ""too young"" to be worrying about infertility. I broke down and started crying and said, ""but what about my pain?"" And she said, ""periods suck sometimes."" She sent me home with a script for ibuprofen.

I never felt so fucking patronized in my entire life. My pain isn't pain that just ""sucks sometimes."" It is hell. It feels like there are weights crushing and pulling down my insides. The pain radiates down my legs and through my back. The pain is literally debilitating. I got up out of bed to puke and I fell to my knees. I couldn't walk. I let out a constant stream of tears for hours. I literally felt like slamming my head into a wall until I passed out. I felt like I was dying. I couldn't function. Even when the pain subsided, I needed to lay in bed for a couple days to recoup. 

Since my obgyn appointment, I've expressed my pain to others. They all pretty much given me the same response that the obgyn did.... 

I'm just exhausted and idk what to do.

First she is like-- do you know you have a fibroid in your uterus?

(Heart drop)

Then she's like:

Okay now let's look at this ovaries.

I psyched myself up at out this morning. With DOR and a AMH of 0.07 me getting even one follicle would be a act of God according to everything I read.

But, I have 3. So, I can do treatment.

THEN she tells me that my husbands sperm count is low for a man of 33. He's supposed to have a count in the 100 mil and it's 21 mil? So she told me to take a picture of fertilaid and NP wants him on it and me on all the supplements especially co q 10 (600 mg). I told her what I've read says supplements don't really work and she looked at me and said/ I've got 20 plus patients that will prove that wrong.

So since I only have one shot she's prescribing not two vials ? Of Menopur? But 5 starting today.


There's no way this is gonna work, but her reasoning to me was ""if you bleed on your own and still produce follicles there's still a shot."" 

(She didn't add: in hell but that was just me).

Oh, and the fibroid is no where near my lining and is just sitting somewhere to the side of my lining like an asshole.

This isn't my first IUI, nor my first trigger shot. In the past it's taken 7/8 days for it to leave my system (yes, I'm that crazy person who tests every day to know when it's all done). 

Currently I'm 11dptrigger and still getting really faint lines on the cheap Wal-Mart tests. This trigger shot I think just a generic hcg shot, it wasn't ovidrel or pregnyl like the other times, it just said HCG 10,000.  

So for fun and to pass the time in this 2ww, how long did it take for the trigger shot to leave your system? Did it vary by brand? I'm assuming the half lives probably vary.

Add thst to the fact that I&#39;m 30 and all of the women in my family went into menopause in their late 30s. </p>

<p>All we want is to even be able to consider that slim possibility that we may, one day, even consider pregnancy. We&#39;ve already had to go through genetic counselling for something unrelated... </p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t seem fair at times. This is one of those times. </p>

<p>And end rant. </p>

If a pairing will not work for you due to one pen pal being secondary infertility or out of your country, for example, please let me know. We can always form a couple groups of 3 if needed.

Someone asked what the procedure should be if one pen pal becomes pregnant. I would suggest discussing with your pen pal how you would like to handle that up front.

I've got a fair bit of couch time ahead of me so I thought I'd share my TAC Surgery story just in case any of you were considering it. It's long and I'm a bit fuzzy from the drugs so please forgive my rambling.
Trans Abdominal Cerclage is one way to correct incompetent cervix. After losing my last pregnancy to IC I was desperate for a guarantee that it wouldn't happen again. My RE referred me to an MFM who said that if I could get pregnant again we would do progesterone shots the entire pregnancy as well as a vaginal cerclage at 12 weeks. This sounded like a plan I could live with until he said that the vaginal cerclage has a 75% success rate. Maybe it's because I'm a teacher, but my response to that was ""umm...that's a C"". Also, for that 75%, success is only defined as live birth meaning many of those included in the 75% still had preterm births with NICU stays and serious health issues and/or long term bed rest during the pregnancy. So I started looking for a better alternative. Thank goodness for the internet!
Through various internet communities I discovered the Trans Abdominal Cerclage. One of the names that came up continually was Dr. Haney who practices in Chicago. So I thought he would be difficult to reach and probably impossible to get an appointment with and also I live in Alabama which is no where near Chicago, but I figured, maybe he can tell me of someone in Alabama who can do the procedure. I set up a phone consultation through emails with his assistant. We talked on the phone for 90 minutes and he walked me through the history of the procedure, how it works and why. I have never talked to anyone like him. The most important thing he said was that this procedure had a 99% success rate. (That's an A+!) And that 99%  is full term without bed rest.  
So I started planning my trip to Chicago. I have good health insurance through BCBS , but I was shocked to learn I would only have to pay $150 for the whole procedure because Dr. Haney was in network. 
We flew to Chicago last Saturday (because hotdogs and pizza and museums oh my!)  My surgery was at 12pm Wednesday the Dr. Haney's office gave me a list of a few hotels near the surgical center. They have incredible special rates for people having surgery at the center. We stayed at the Whitehall Hotel so we could just walk right across the street to the surgical center. The surgical center was small, modern and clean. They were very prompt and I wasn't in the waiting room for more than 5 minutes. My surgery was at 12 I was under full anesthesia and when I woke up around 2:30 the nurse insisted I get up and walk down the hall to the restroom. It was a bit of a struggle, but it mostly felt like I had been to the gym the night before and was sore from doing too many sit ups. 
I was back at the hotel by 3:30 with my percocet prescription. I was fairly comfortable except for getting in and out of bed. I was taking the percocet every 3 hours then each day I would space it out a bit more. I am now 4 days out and taking them every 6 hours. I can walk around fine I just need to get up and sit down slowly. I couldn't possibly be back at work. Dr. Haney suggested a 10 day recovery. 
If I can get pregnant again I will still see a MFM for monitoring every 2 weeks for peace of mind and will have a c-section at 38 weeks. 
All in all, I'm very happy with my bionic cervix thus far.

Sorry I know I've posted quite a bit lately. But I'm at a loss on how to proceed...

We have a plan (hope) for trying to get pregnant with IUI as well as femara but some of my tests aren't coming back normal.

Like I said in my other two posts, my TSH in November was 3.59 and yesterday after a retest it came back as 0.04. My free T4 was 1.8.

As many of you suggested it could have been a lab mistake and recommended a retest. I messaged my doctor and asked him what is going on because he had sent me a message saying he thought I had hyperthyroidism now not hypothyroidism which showed up on my test in November.


I had mentioned to him that I felt more symptom wise of hypothyroidism so I was fearful of a lab error and asked if I should retest or if he thought they were correct. He replied this morning saying he thinks I have either Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves disease. But he will not be doing any further testing for another two months. Here's a short bit of what he said for more insight:

""With regard to the blood test for TSH, I suspect that you have Hahimoto's thyroiditis or Graves disease which can cause you to have some highs and lows in your thyroid levels in the short term.  There is no reason to repeat the test now, but we will follow up in two months to get a better sense of what is going on for you. 

I can refer you to a Endocrine specialist if you are interested to get more information.  Just let me know. ""


I'm even more confused. From a quick Googling those are opposite diseases one is hypothyroid related and the other one is hyperthyroid related. I think it's kind of weird to leave it alone for the next two months though, right? Especially since we're staying femara tomorrow! Or am I worrying too much? Should I request to see an endocrinologist or do you feel like that one help much? What would you do if you are in my situation because I'm seriously at a loss.

Thank you for reading 💜

I have done 2 rounds of Femara. My first round I had to get an HCG shot because I wouldn't ovulate on my own but on my 2nd cycle I did ovulate on my own. Obviously, neither of those cycles ended with a pregnancy. There is no Male infertility factor as my fiance's sample count was 10x the ""normal"" range and while he did have some morphology to consider the RE said it was inconsequential considering that his actual count was so high. 


My HSG was clear and I had a polyp removed in surgery and my RE said he did not feel IUI would serve me any better than just us having sex at home so that is what we did. Initially my fiance and I had discussed doing 3 rounds of Femara before moving on to IVF but I got a little nervous because he is getting surgery soon (ear surgery and a possible surgery on his lumbar spine due to disc herniation and it pressing on nerves) and he is also on summer vacation only until early August (he is a HS teacher.) 


I have great health insurance that covers IVF and I have a zero deductible. So cost is not the issue. Maybe I am getting cold feet but I just wanted to ask for opinions from stranger ladies on this sub who have gone through IVF or are hoping to go through IVF if you think I am making the right decision or if I should do one more round of Femara. My RE told me to take a day to think about it because I can call in tomorrow and get a prescription for Femara instead of filling my birth control prescription to start the IVF process.

My fiance says the decision is up to me because it is my body. He wants to have a baby with me and that is all he will say. 


Pretty much my RE said if I were going to get pregnant on Femara it would have happened in my first 2 cycles. He said my chances of pregnancy would go up significantly with IVF (duh). I told him I was nervous about IVF because of the at-home shots and the big needles, and he said there are no big needles just small ones the size of my eyelash. I watch a lot of youtube videos and he said I should not. 


I have no friends to talk to this about because everyone is either having no problems getting pregnant or have no desire to become pregnant at this stage in their lives. So I will defer to this online community instead. 


I really wanted the Femara to work. I felt that if I could get pregnant with just the help of pills I'd feel better somehow? Having to resort to IVF makes me feel bad about myself. The process itself is a lot more invasive. And then if IVF doesn't even work WTF is wrong with me? 


My fiance put some sperm on ice today just in case he won't be able to donate in the future and he also gave blood for his infectious diseases test. We opted out of genetic testing initially but now I'm thinking maybe we should do it? He feels we don't need to. Thoughts on that?

I finally found an RE that I really like at Kaiser - a reproductive surgeon who was finally able to successfully do my HSG.

But he DICTATES his emails, which would be hilarious if I wasn't invested in actually understanding them. 

This is relevant because he suggested in an email -I think- in garbled half sentences, that a hysteroscopy is an option I might want to consider because of ""possible polyps"" that he saw during my HSG. 

Well, as you can imagine, I was a bit put off continuing to communicate with him via email about something like this, and it takes weeks to get an actual in-person appointment with him, so I spoke to my regular NP at my baseline CD3 ultrasound today (she's the main person coordinating my care at the clinic). She said she'd recommend going ahead with another letrozole cycle this month and next month doing a 3D ultrasound with one of the REs to look for polyps instead of doing a hysteroscopy.

Am over this week like nothing else.  At 2am I decided that this sub reddit would be the place where people would get the frustration. 

[warning: rant ahead]

Yesterday I messaged my clinic.  I'm supposed to go in for an FET on Thursday, which also happens to be the worst day of the year for me to not be in the office.  I emailed them with a request to be scheduled as late as possible so that I could be sure to get there on time (I've got a long trip to get there and it's going to be raining).  

I got an email back that said ""Oh, has your doctor been in touch?  He's left the country unexpectedly and we don't know when he'll be back.  But he's got someone else to cover for him!  Go ahead for your blood test tomorrow, and we'll be in touch!""

...an email.  Two days before transfer.  I know I'm jumped up on stress and overreacting to everything (like when someone stole my lunch out of the fridge yesterday).  But.  But.  *An email?!*  It's also worth noting that we could have gone ahead a month ago with a transfer, but we opted to wait because my doctor was away. 

I actually have met the doctor who will be doing the transfer (he's the only other doctor I've met) - he did my partner's procedure.  He's supposed to be very good, and I liked his attitude.  I'm so mad right now, though.  

I know that a lot of people say ""switch it up if your doctor isn't working for you!""  But this probably isn't what they meant.

I know that doctors are people too, and I am sure that for a professional to leave so suddenly this has to be a very serious issue.  I hope he is okay.  But that doesn't mean I am not really really mad.

I'm 31, TTC for 2.5 years, 5 rounds of Clomid and TI, 4 rounds of Femara/Letrozole and IUI.  One MMC with Clomid.  Diagnosed with PCOS, but no insulin resistance, and mild Hypothyroid (take synthroid). HSG and the other one, HSY maybe?, looked fine but hurt like a motherfucker.  I cried - it was a bad scene. Husband's sperm is just lovely and fine (for baby-making, not consumption). Insurance covers unlimited IUI, but ZERO for IVF amd ZERO for meds.  When they're paying for 970th IUI, I'll be sure to give them a cost/benefit analysis.  Assholes.  

After our 4th (anticipated) failed IUI, my husband and I met with my RE today.  She advised (as expected) that doing more IUIs will likely have diminishing returns.  The fact that I turn into an unbearbly miserable shit stain of a human after every negative test seems to support her hypothesis.  Anyway, she have me 3 options:

1) Keep doing IUIs.  I seem to respond to the Femara but 4 IUIs indicate that either there's another issue or I'm super lucky.  She talked about injectables but said that since I already respond ok to Femara, it'd be expensive and probably not work.  Love it.

2) Straight to IVF.  Costs $9300 plus anesthesia ($500ish) and meds ($2-5k per cycle).  Fffffuuuuck.  In my age group, my clinic has 51% success, so it's  basically like dropping $12k+ on black at the roulette table.  Harumph.  I could make it happen with some beans and ramen.  If there's anything that I've learned here, it's to NOT COUNT ON SUCCESS - the idea of eating ramen and failing seems too much to bear.  I am not as strong as some of you ladies.

3) She gave us the option (but did not recommend) a diagnostic laparoscopy.  I have painful periods and some pain during sex (if enthusiastic), but the other tests and ultrasounds haven't indicated endo.  My insurance WOULD cover this, buut she still said that it may not be worth the risk and pain.

I've been obsessively googling all the things and read pretty much every post on this sub with ""laparoscopy"" in the title and I'm seeing a lot of mixed viewpoints.  On the one hand, doing it could maybe, possibly, not bigly, help fertility for a few months and potentially move us from unexplained to ""you're straight fucked, bust out the wallet"" category. Yay?  On the other, it's surgery  (even if minor), it apparently turns you into a painful bag of farts, and it's likely that IVF would be the next step anyway if they find funkiness.  

Also of note is that I have a diminishing amount of time off from work in which to get shit done.  I'm in the closet and plan to remain there as I work at a small company in a tint office chock full of busybodies).  So, taking large swaths of time off is a no.  

She also said that there are only two main brands of FSH and they both come in clicky pens.  I though I read on here that it can be cheaper to not use the pens, but I could be misremembering.  Cheaper is good.

Is there any chance that some of you amazing and knowledgeable ladies  (with great senses of humor in the face of fuck you in the ass circumstances) might be able to just chime in?  I'm lost and I feel like my head is exploding.  My husband is a ""whatever you think is best"" guy, which is great when I'm shopping, but less so with this kind of thing.

Suspected endo and male issues. We were told ivf was the best option. The initial news was a shock, we always say if it meant taking a pill we would do it, but nothing further. Great they said 1 round would be funded, but I always pictured 2 kids, then the news we may get one shot, but how I'd afford a second I dont know.

 I was feeling really good and positive, trying not to get hopes up, but also hard not to.

I went to a new RE today and he was wonderful, like amazingly wonderful! But the tests that I took for my OB that were considered normal are now high.

We talked about my AMH which is 1.86 and my FSH at 8.2 on CD3. We're moving forward to femara and an IUI planned once my husband's blood tests are cleared (his sperm looks good).

But then I got an email from him about 20 minutes after the appointment that says my TSH is also high, at 3.59. My mom has thyroid problems and I have a laundry list of fatigue and chronic pain issues that cannot directly be connected to my cerebral palsy. These tests were all CD3 tests.

I have to go back tomorrow to do another blood test for TSH. What does this all mean? I look on Google and all of my numbers are in the normal range but I am only 24 so I'm still trying to understand what this all means. Are they high for my age? Does this automatically mean that I have hypothyroidism?


Please help me not freak out anymore. I already sobbed like a baby earlier. I'm getting my period any day now and I'm overwhelmed trying to understand. I felt like I got it at the appointment but now I'm lost.

Mr. Goose came down with a cancer diagnosis 1 year in and we stored 9 vials of pre-chemo sperm and jumped straight to IVF. Fast forward 3 months and that resulted in 12 eggs, 5 mature, 0 fertilized with ICSI. They said my eggs were degenerating before they could even get to them basically - which they shouldn't do. They say with the protocol I was on, that was normally meant for someone 40+, I should have produced more eggs and especially mature ones. That was the first mention of donor eggs. We found a donor, but she isn't available until August. In the meantime I had Lap surgery to remove stage 2 endo and a hysteroscopy to remove 2 polyps. Then we tried IUI which just gave confirmation of failure 2 days ago. 

It's now time to start birth control pills to sync up with my donor for 2 months from now. When we first went into the donor egg thought process I was 100% ok with it because more than anything we just want a healthy baby. However, with this IUI it got my mind back on ""this could result in a kid of my own blood and genetics"" and I'm having trouble mentally getting back on the donor train. We COULD keep trying IUI with me or go for IVF again, but I've been to 2 clinics who both say my eggs are useless so it would be a waste and lead to lots of heartache. Mr. Goose says it's completely my decision because he is fine either way and knows that with the donor eggs it is me it will be ""leaving out"" so he supports whatever decision I'm comfortable with. 

I guess I am just looking for some women with experience in this. What was your thought process like? If you had success, what is life like now and how do you feel? What was the decision like? 

We don't have the option to keep trying naturally with him going through/finishing chemo and there are even no guarantees he will have usable sperm afterwards. So if we keep trying with me our only options are artificially (not like we had any luck the natural way anyway). This also means any IUI or IVF we do could possibly be using our only supply - which is now down to 6.

Any help or advice is appreciated! I know I bitch and whine on here a lot..it's just a lot to come to terms with and I know you all understand. This whole body failure journey has been made much easier having this place to come to, so thank you.

Mr. Goose came down with a cancer diagnosis 1 year in and we stored 9 vials of pre-chemo sperm and jumped straight to IVF. Fast forward 3 months and that resulted in 12 eggs, 5 mature, 0 fertilized with ICSI. They said my eggs were degenerating before they could even get to them basically - which they shouldn&#39;t do. They say with the protocol I was on, that was normally meant for someone 40+, I should have produced more eggs and especially mature ones. That was the first mention of donor eggs. We found a donor, but she isn&#39;t available until August. In the meantime I had Lap surgery to remove stage 2 endo and a hysteroscopy to remove 2 polyps. Then we tried IUI which just gave confirmation of failure 2 days ago. </p>

<p>It&#39;s now time to start birth control pills to sync up with my donor for 2 months from now. When we first went into the donor egg thought process I was 100% ok with it because more than anything we just want a healthy baby. However, with this IUI it got my mind back on &quot;this could result in a kid of my own blood and genetics&quot; and I&#39;m having trouble mentally getting back on the donor train. We COULD keep trying IUI with me or go for IVF again, but I&#39;ve been to 2 clinics who both say my eggs are useless so it would be a waste and lead to lots of heartache. Mr. Goose says it&#39;s completely my decision because he is fine either way and knows that with the donor eggs it is me it will be &quot;leaving out&quot; so he supports whatever decision I&#39;m comfortable with. </p>

<p>I guess I am just looking for some women with experience in this. What was your thought process like? If you had success, what is life like now and how do you feel? What was the decision like? </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have the option to keep trying naturally with him going through/finishing chemo and there are even no guarantees he will have usable sperm afterwards. So if we keep trying with me our only options are artificially (not like we had any luck the natural way anyway).

Looks like there was a piece left over that we just couldn't see on the ultrasound, so I'm happy that we did it even though I was hoping to avoid any sort of manipulation to my cervix and uterus. Sample was sent to pathology so maybe that will yield something interesting, although I'm not expecting anything. After this, once my HCG FINALLY gets down to 0, we'll be doing some testing on me and a follow up HSG. I'm still not expecting to find anything there, but I appreciate my doc wanting to avoid wasting another cycle/FET when there might be something fixable/explainable going on with me. I've never wanted there to be something (fixable) wrong with me more in my life LOL.

Now we just have to think about what to do after all of the diagnostics are done. We have cycles left with insurance which include a retrieval and transfer, however an FET is considered an attempt and we'd be unable to like..""bank"" the retrieval. 

My spouse really doesn't want to put me through another retrieval because of how miserable I was last time, and my doctor has made it clear that I'm at particularly high risk for OHSS. Spouse doesn't want to risk my long term health and thinks we should do an FET next, pending what the diagnostics find. He's willing to pay for the FET out of pocket to not waste the whole cycle with insurance which I think is stupid when we could use the cycles we have for their max worth and have embryos banked to do FET with after.

I personally want to do another whole cycle and see if we can bank another embryo. We currently have two on ice, PGS done. We'd want to do PGS again, but to do that we have to have $$$$ on hand to burn and we just don't have it right now and likely won't for quite some time. I imagine that we MIGHT be ready to do this again in about 6-8 months, which..depending on the timing of diagnostics and how soon my levels get back to normal and my cycle starts up again, might not even be such a long time. 

Another choice we have, again pending diagnostics and what the new HSG will reveal..is starting IUI again! My new insurance covers a LOT of IUI- like, when I called to ask questions about the coverage it didn't seem like there was a limit at all because they covered it under ""same day surgery"". Considering that it might take a long time to get our funds together to pay for PGS with the next cycle, I asked about the possibility of trying IUI again while we wait. My doctor gave me the  is concerned about my overall egg/embryo quality because of how many of my blasts were mosaic and noted that if we did get pregnant, I had a much higher chance of miscarriage. Has anyone tried this, gone ""backwards"", and had any sort of luck/good outcome?

This one was successful, though very painful. They had to manually dilate me to get the catheter in. At least he was honest. None of that ""might feel a little pressure"" shit. He said, ""okay, you're going to hate this, but it's the only way."" Which I actually appreciated. Turns out my uterus is almost totally on the left side of my body, so there's a hard right turn that has to be navigated to get in. 

My left tube spilled immediately, and my right tube spilled after some additional contrast was put in (ouch!). So I guess that's good news, though it still keeps me unexplained after almost a year and a half. 

I have a couple of questions for you all that I forgot to ask him because I was just sort of recovering from the pain as he was going over things. 

One is that he used the term ""cervical stenosis"" and asked if I had really painful periods. Not sure - I mean, I have a few days of pretty bad cramps, but I think that's probably normal. Advil mostly gets rid of them. Can cervical stenosis make it harder to get pregnant? I know sperm are tiny, but can a smaller opening still reduce your chances? Trying to decide whether a few cycles of IUIs might be in order rather than rushing to IVF from here. One doctor told me that IUIs would be too hard for me because of my anatomy to be worth the tiny increase in our odds, but the doctor who did my HSG today easily got an IUI catheter in me as a trial run before the HSG - so I think it was just the larger size of the HSG tube that was the problem. 

Second question is that he mentioned it looked like I might have a few small polyps. He didn't say anything else about it and I was too drugged and overwhelmed (I took a hefty benzo before the procedure) to ask more, but now I'm wondering if that could be an issue and it would be worth looking into getting them removed. Or are small polyps not a big deal? 

Last question is about the safety of birth control pills for us ladies over 35. I'm a little over a month in (had to take them while waiting to schedule the HSG with this particular doctor, who's very busy), and am thinking about taking them for another week because I've got a work trip that's going to fall right in my fertile window if I stop now and get my period tomorrow or the next day. However, I had my first ocular migraine in years last night (basically aura without pain), and I was reading that people with migraine with aura shouldn't take birth control because of heightened risk of stroke. I hadn't had one in over a decade (and haven't taken hormonal BC in 15 years), so it didn't really cross my mind when they prescribed a month of birth control. Any of you know anything about this? Are the BC risks like stroke more after long term use, or tend to happen when you first start? I'll obviously ask my doctor about all these things as well, but just wondering if you all have thoughts. 

Thanks everyone! It was a very unpleasant experience, not me at my most dignified (definitely made some sounds), but I'm so glad at least to have it over with and be un-benched!

Another semen analysis and meeting with his new urologist who specializes in male infertility. I'm bummed because the urologist actually said he was pessimistic about finding anything and that my husband's cancer treatments are without a doubt what are causing his infertility. He's been on Clomid now for a month and a half so we go back in a couple of months to do another semen analysis and then maybe wait another month for another if there's no sperm in the next one and then if THAT doesn't show any progress, we go back for surgery to see if they can biopsy anything to see if there's any chance at all. The doctor says Clomid takes at least three months to produce anything. 

The good news is that my husband has normal testosterone levels now and he is already feeling improvements, health wise. 

I'm just really starting to feel bummed and I don't want to. Tomorrow is his birthday and I want to be happy for him especially because he's a childhood cancer survivor. 

Part of me just wants to move onto adoption just to feel some progress and change. He wants to wait until surgery to even tell all of our friends and his family. This is tough y'all. (As I'm sure all of you can relate)

I got a clean bill of health and my end is good - reserves are good, timings good, tubes clear... all good. We still haven't decided definitively about what we will do after this all if nothing is discovered. I just keep seeing more and more babies and hearing, ""are you pregnant?"" I'm so, so tired of it. I'm doing poorly at work and got points taken off at my employee evaluation, I'm very moody at work and even sometimes at home. Even though all my coworkers know what's going on, I still feel like they don't always think that it affects me so deeply. I also don't want them to ask questions.

I just wish I could quit my job and putz around at home. 

To top it off, my husband and I saw a counselor who never called us back for a follow up appointment when she said she would. We got so busy that I never got a chance to call back during the ""free"" period of my employee benefit of five free counseling sessions. I'm getting so discouraged. Every time I call my EPB, I have to explain my whole story to them.

He&#39;s been on Clomid now for a month and a half so we go back in a couple of months to do another semen analysis and then maybe wait another month for another if there&#39;s no sperm in the next one and then if THAT doesn&#39;t show any progress, we go back for surgery to see if they can biopsy anything to see if there&#39;s any chance at all. The doctor says Clomid takes at least three months to produce anything. </p>

<p>The good news is that my husband has normal testosterone levels now and he is already feeling improvements, health wise. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just really starting to feel bummed and I don&#39;t want to. Tomorrow is his birthday and I want to be happy for him especially because he&#39;s a childhood cancer survivor. </p>

<p>Part of me just wants to move onto adoption just to feel some progress and change. He wants to wait until surgery to even tell all of our friends and his family. This is tough y&#39;all. (As I&#39;m sure all of you can relate)</p>

<p>I got a clean bill of health and my end is good - reserves are good, timings good, tubes clear... all good. We still haven&#39;t decided definitively about what we will do after this all if nothing is discovered. I just keep seeing more and more babies and hearing, &quot;are you pregnant?&quot; I&#39;m so, so tired of it. I&#39;m doing poorly at work and got points taken off at my employee evaluation, I&#39;m very moody at work and even sometimes at home. Even though all my coworkers know what&#39;s going on, I still feel like they don&#39;t always think that it affects me so deeply. I also don&#39;t want them to ask questions.</p>

<p>I just wish I could quit my job and putz around at home. </p>

<p>To top it off, my husband and I saw a counselor who never called us back for a follow up appointment when she said she would. We got so busy that I never got a chance to call back during the &quot;free&quot; period of my employee benefit of five free counseling sessions. I&#39;m getting so discouraged. Every time I call my EPB, I have to explain my whole story to them. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading if you&#39;ve gotten this far. I&#39;m always feeling exhausted and I used to feel upbeat most of the time. It sucks. </p>

Last year I started having irregular cycles. That along with not getting pregnant this whole time and my advancing age prompted me to finally get tested. I went to a fertility doctor and after monitoring 3 cycles, numerous blood work, and an ultrasound, he decided I needed to have a sonohystogram and hysterosalpingogram. During this process they found that my cervix/uterus is crooked? (I'm still not sure which one to be honest and if that's what they even meant by what they told me). They also found several masses. I had the laparoscopy procedure done to remove the masses. While having the laparoscopy done they found I had a prolapsed uterus and fixed that too. I also had scar tissue but no endometriosis.

I've tried literally like 6 or 7 protocols now. I had three retrievals and a bunch of cancelled cycles last year, did all manner of estrogen priming, lupron demi-halt (I think that's the same as micro-flare), other lupron priming protocols, mini IVF with just femara. No matter what we did or how many follicles were retrieved and fertilized, they would pretty much all die before day 3. My record was I think 5 retrieved, most fertilized nicely with PICSI and looked great, and then only one made it to day 3.

On all of these I was on pretty high doses of stims. My RE started to think that my eggs are ""sensitive"" and the high stim doses were damaging them, because the crazy drop off from day 1 to day 3 is not normal. It's indicative of bad egg quality, but we're not sure if this is inherent to my eggs or caused by blasting them with a fuckton of stims every time.

So this was supposed to be our last cycle before moving on to donor. My RE had a patient come from another clinic who had similar problems and had done [this nutty protocol](http://i.imgur.com/RmeFRh5.jpg) with clomid and femara, and then a low dose of stims every other day.

<p>I&#39;ve tried literally like 6 or 7 protocols now. I had three retrievals and a bunch of cancelled cycles last year, did all manner of estrogen priming, lupron demi-halt (I think that&#39;s the same as micro-flare), other lupron priming protocols, mini IVF with just femara. No matter what we did or how many follicles were retrieved and fertilized, they would pretty much all die before day 3. My record was I think 5 retrieved, most fertilized nicely with PICSI and looked great, and then only one made it to day 3.</p>

<p>On all of these I was on pretty high doses of stims. My RE started to think that my eggs are &quot;sensitive&quot; and the high stim doses were damaging them, because the crazy drop off from day 1 to day 3 is not normal. It&#39;s indicative of bad egg quality, but we&#39;re not sure if this is inherent to my eggs or caused by blasting them with a fuckton of stims every time.</p>

<p>So this was supposed to be our last cycle before moving on to donor. My RE had a patient come from another clinic who had similar problems and had done <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/RmeFRh5.jpg"">this nutty protocol</a> with clomid and femara, and then a low dose of stims every other day.

Bernice Yeung is a reporter for Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting who covers race and gender. She has covered topics ranging from sexual assault among low-wage immigrant  workers to human trafficking to the explosion of girls in the juvenile justice system. Her award-winning work has appeared in a variety of media outlets, including The New York Times, The Seattle Times, the Guardian US, the International Herald Tribune, KQED-FM and PBS Frontline. 


**WHO IS JONATHAN JONES?**


Jonathan Jones is a freelance investigative reporter based in San Francisco. Much of his work has focused on business, health and human rights. In 2013, Jones’s investigation into assisted living for ProPublica and PBS FRONTLINE exposed serious problems with Emeritus, then the largest assisted living corporation in the United States. His investigation into the relationship between Bridgestone/Firestone and the infamous Liberian warlord Charles Taylor won two Emmys, an RFK Journalism & Human Rights Award and the Investigative Reporters and Editors award for the best multi-platform project by large organizations.  


**Brief description of the story Bernice and Jonathan have been working on:**


For the millions of American women struggling to get pregnant, in-vitro fertilization is the medicine of miracles. But the price of the fertility treatment is steep, financially and emotionally. Failure can be especially devastating, and a round of IVF can cost upward of $20,000. Unsuccessful patients are often motivated to try again. And again. The only federal law that explicitly addresses IVF requires the government to publish fertility clinic success rates. But this antiquated measurement system, coupled with scant oversight, obscure the differences between the best doctors in the business and those who run troubled clinics and push a risky practice.

Monday, before bed, I had some bright red spotting. I figured this signaled the start of my period especially since I had been off BCPs for 4 days. I took the first estrace Tuesday morning. Since then though, I haven't really gotten a full flow. I worried I took the estrace too soon. I called the nurse today and she said it was fine, but I'm not certain I explained everything well enough. I did read an old post on here about someone going directly from BCPs to estrace without a withdrawal bleed, so maybe I am ok?

<p>In preparation for this FET, I was on birth control pills. The nurse made it very clear that I wasn&#39;t supposed to start the estrace until day 1 of my cycle. Monday, before bed, I had some bright red spotting. I figured this signaled the start of my period especially since I had been off BCPs for 4 days. I took the first estrace Tuesday morning. Since then though, I haven&#39;t really gotten a full flow. I worried I took the estrace too soon. I called the nurse today and she said it was fine, but I&#39;m not certain I explained everything well enough. I did read an old post on here about someone going directly from BCPs to estrace without a withdrawal bleed, so maybe I am ok?  </p>

We know at least part of the problem is my husband has very low motility and low testosterone. In Feb of this month I had my testosterone checked at my OBGYN with a blood test, my Testosterone, total was 30ng/dL and my free was 2.9 pg/mL. Obviously those are both great numbers. We were in the very beginning of the TEST EVERYTHING phase. I have hashimoto's thyroid disease so we knew my numbers might be wonky anyways, but they were great. 

Flash forward 
1) I am seeing a compound pharmacist who test my testosterone with a saliva test (on day 20 of my cycle) and I have gone up to 62 pg/mL. This number is still in the normal range but I am over weight (192lbs & 5' tall) and the compound pharmacist really thinks I have PCOS.

2) My husband is on clomid and his numbers have greatly improved. We just completed our second cycle of IUI. Because we are going to a fertility doctor I KNOW i have ovulated. Blood work & transvaginal ultrasound have confirmed that I have ovulated both months. Also both times I have gotten the IUI the doctor has blown away at how textbook my cervix looks and has commented that next time she would like to have students come and look at my amazing beautiful cervix. My FSH is 5.77 & my ANTI MULLERIAN is 3.30. My doctor's fully believe I have healthy eggs & I'm ovulating.

My question is do i have PCOS!?!?!!?!??!!? My testosterone has doubled in a little more than 3 months. Could this be from different collection methods (blood work vs. saliva collection)? My weight has stayed the same this whole time, but my synthroid dose has been increased (50-88mg). I do have other PCOS symptoms but they are also thyroid symptoms.

I feel like I used to have a little light on in my soul and that light is out. I am terrified that IVF won&#39;t work and that I won&#39;t be able to handle it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m strong enough for it. I&#39;m losing touch with my husband, I feel myself pulling away from him in sadness because I can&#39;t bear to see <em>him</em> be sad (how selfish am I?). I feel like a bad wife and a bad friend. I know part of these sad feelings are progesterone-induced, and they will pass. </p>

<p>You&#39;re the only lot who gets this. I&#39;m tired of trying to hold it together. I&#39;m tired of the complicated emotions of feeling sad, feeling guilty for feeling sad because &quot;look at all this other great stuff you have in your life like a family and a job and a husband some people don&#39;t even have that,&quot; and then suppressing all the feelings again (which is why I&#39;m finally here, crying them all out into my keyboard). </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. I just think I need to end this post with a shout at the fucking universe in anger and in despair: FUCK YOU, FUCK THIS, FUCK IT ALL. </p>

And I've searched the Internet looking for some advice (and maybe a wee bit of a reality check) for some time now but I'm not finding anything so I decided to post for myself . 

Anyway, I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome AND endometriosis around four years ago. So I exsperience a lot of pain on a regular basis but because I've always desperately wanted children I've always put up with it. 

3 years ago I met my fiancé. 

I went to the doctors for regular check ups and they would always say ""have you thought about having a baby?"" And I always said no not yet. Because I wasn't in the position to. I knew my ovaries were deteriorating, that there was a huge amount of scar tissue on them and there had been a discussion about the possible need to remove my left ovary if it got worse. 

But... at my last doctors appointment they didn't suggest getting pregnant. 

And it's amazing how a comment I used to get so angry about, hearing it so often, could break my heart when the doctor didn't say it. 

My ovaries are dying. 

And my god that's a hard sentence to type when I'm 23. It's a possibility I never considered. 

But as I said, I'm engaged, and I've been with my fiancé for three years. The doctors has said if I ever want to have children I need to start trying now, that it already might be too late but it's the final count down. My ovaries need to come out, the pain will get worse, they could become infected etc etc. 
And I thought that's what we'd do, we had always talked about having kids later on.
And no we're not in the greatest financial position, we don't have the best jobs, we still flat with our friends but...
We both want to have kids. 
But he doesn't want to now. Not yet. 

I don't have time to wait. I won't... I can't force him into it. I can't just get pregnant because I want to even tho he's not ready...
And won't be ready for ""5-10years"". I obviously, don't have that kind of time.

But my heart is breaking. 
Yes it may already be too late but...
How can we not even try? 
Can we even survive this? 

I feel like I'm sacrificing everything I've ever wanted (having kids) for him because he's not ready and I'm angry. Im selfish and I'm so angry. 

So I guess... I'm just looking for advice. 
How do I deal with the fact this has happened to me?
How can I let go of how angry I am?
And how can we move past this?

I just saw my re for the first time and he was a total douche. He wasn't interested in the sitting to my problems or anything and he rushed to the entire appointment.

But he said when he was looking at my test results that one of the ovarian test or a test was a 1.86 and they usually like to have it at 2.0. But, for the life of me I cannot figure out which test it is.


And although I told him the high risk pregnancy doctor told me last year that I could not take Clomid due to the higher risk of twins ( I know it's a small percentage but I have cerebral palsy and I would not be able to carry twins) he said not to worry about it and it's no big deal. There's nothing I can do about my diet exercise weight or anything except for take Clomid and hopefully that would work and if not then I have to be transferred to a different hospital to do IUI or IVF treatments.


Do you guys have any idea what that test he was talking about maybe? I looked online at my CD3 testing and I don't see one result that comes out as a 1.86. So I'm very confused. Do any of you know what that could be?


Thank you

PS. My best friend is about to give birth to her second whoopsie child (she isn't married, can't afford this or the other kid and her relationship is a mess..) My sister had an abortion in December and didn't even think twice about it. Totally had a it's whatever attitude although she knows I'm TTC. Plus she's older than me. And my co-worker brought in his few month old son which totally stabbed me in the heart. Oh, and I just remembered that I have seen that doctor before when I had an anovulatory cycle. I saw him instead of my normal OB and he presented himself as an OB so I'm very confused why he's the RE that I'm seeing.  I will switch soon

I already feel like IF has robbed me from being able to tell my husband we got pregnant in some cutesy way (if this ever works), and I don&#39;t want it to rob us from announcing it to our families, too.  </p>

<p>Sorry that was so long and rambly. I&#39;m feeling quite anxious and sad today. </p>

<p>Edit: Thank you, thank you, thank you for all your thoughtful answers/replies. I&#39;m reading all of them and really appreciate it. </p>

Last FET I was on del estrogen every 3 days to prep my lining. Prior to my lining check I had heavy break through bleeding, but it only lasted a couple of hours. At the lining check, my lining was too thin, so they had me add oral estrace twice a day. My lining did finally get thick enough for their liking and we were able to go ahead with the transfer (a week later than scheduled).

This time at my suggestion we added the estrace from the beginning, vaginally this time, still twice a day. Still doing del estrogen every 3 days. I went for my lining check Saturday and my lining was only at 5.2. I started spotting Saturday and Sunday and had basically a full flow for half a day today. I'm back to spotting now, tapering off, even.

They told me to come back in tomorrow to monitor again. I did not start the PIO yet. I called today when the flow was heavy to see if they wanted me to adjust any dosages but they say no, just come tomorrow to see what's going on.

My questions are:
1. Why is my lining insufficient to begin with? Do they just not have me on enough estrogen? Are there other meds that need to be added?
2. Why am I having breakthrough bleeding while on estrogen? This doesn't seem typical.
3. Why is my uterus a black hole where embryos go to die? (Kidding. Kind of.)

First, I wanted to say thank you for all of your incredibly supportive comments early last week when we got the [poor fertilization report](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6coykn/w_t_f/?st=j39d310r&sh=a4a98ba8). (I hope I did the link thing right...) I read all of your comments but didn't have any emotional energy to respond or even be on reddit until today, but wanted you all to know how much they were appreciated. You guys are my rock. Also I got less mad at husband within 3 hours and we talked and it was all fine. Had a really nice date night Thursday and great couch sex =) 

My update is shockingly some good news (background: 7 follicles, 6 eggs, 2 fertilized, poor grade on day 3, very very discouraged)- we got one blastocyst! Both embryos were not good looking at day 3 so we decided to grow out to day 5/6 so that on the off chance we still had something, we could be more confident in its chance to survive the freeze/thaw and maybe even take when transferred. And low and behold one survived and is a 2BB, so we're actually really happy with that! That gives us a total of four frozen embryos, the other three being day 3. Does that mean that our blast will have a better chance of ""taking"" than the day 3 embryos?

Regardless, really happy with that considering I thought we were not going to get anything at all!

So anyway. My brother in law is a year younger than me and has some learning disabilities. He had his first serious girlfriend last year, and they started having sex and the in-laws (understandably so) freaked out a bit worrying about him getting her pregnant. She has disabilities as well and couldn't remember to take the pill every day and has a shitty family that wouldn't support her more to try something like an IUD. So, after lots and lots and lots of strife and discussions between my MIL, FIL, and BIL, they came to the agreement that a vasectomy would be best because BIL may never be able to live alone, let alone care for a child.  

Enter present day: We are at the in laws helping them with stuff at their new house. MIL and I are talking and infertility comes up because it always does (we've been open with our families about it). Turns out the urologist that did BIL's vasectomy is a family friend of theirs who specializes in infertility and they offered to talk to us if we ever need it/want a second opinion, which was super sweet of them.  

So curiosity got the best of me and I asked if she knew if BIL's counts, etc. since they have to do pre and post vasectomy SAs. I've been wanting to know in case it's genetic but thought it was super awkward to ask about, and thought this was as good of a time as any. 

Her response was that his counts were extremely high and that it all looked good (which is good but so unfair and made me feel way more sad than I was anticipating). Then she goes on to say they considered offering us his semen to use. And THEN she says that FIL was with him for the actual procedure (because of his special needs) and that FIL said ""He's really well endowed!"" ew ew ew ew and then she responded with ""Wonder where he gets that from!"" EW EW EW. Things I did not want or need to know about!

For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, r/InfertilityBabies. Of course, you are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences (and continue to support other community members) here on r/infertility.

I am new to this forum--thanks for being here!  I have been trying for my first since August 2016, and have had 2 MCs and a CP during that time.

In the past couple months, I have started seeing an RE.  I like him a lot--he is personable, happy to answer questions, and has mostly very positive reviews.  So far, we have done lots of blood tests, an SHG, and an endometrial biopsy.  The first two didn't show anything of note, but the endometrial biopsy showed that the endometrium was out of phase with my menstrual cycle, which means I have a luteal phase defect.  This makes sense to me, because with both of my miscarriages my progesterone was low.  The RE prescribed femara for me to start next cycle, and I came away from the conversation feeling relieved to have a diagnosis and a plan.

However, when I began to research, I found many sites that said the endometrial biopsy is an outdated an ineffective way to diagnose luteal phase defect.  This is making me nervous that:
a) Maybe the diagnosis is incorrect and
b) Maybe I should not trust my RE if he is performing outdated procedures.

I was wondering if you all could share your experiences with endometrial biopsies.  Are they still commonly performed?  If you had one and were diagnosed with luteal phase defect, were you prescribed femara?  If so, what has your experience with femara been like?  Do you think this is a big red flag?

I was told my hospital terminated the partnership with the clinic that performs PGD tests, therefore, they can't start anyone's treatment at the present. 

They are trying to find another lab with equal good embryologists but due to the hospital not working on weekends and other peculiarities they are struggling to find one. 

As for me (and all their other patients) we are left in a limbo, where between 3 weeks and never they hope to find a solution. 

I have no means to move my referral to London (the only other centre that does this type of analysis) because my treatment was funded locally and they will not cover it anyway. 

I am at loss, I am beyond angry and beyond disappointment. 

I was referred to them after they double confirmed my genetic tests, suggesting that IVF+PGD was a better solution than just doing CVS if I ever got pregnant. 

As a woman, I looked at them as a Godsend, as they were offering me the opportunity to avoid having to wait 3 months before having the genetic test performed on the fetus if I ever got pregnant. I know you all can relate to the relief I felt when I was told all this. I dreaded this my whole life, and now they were offering me new hope. 

I jumped through the every hoop they asked me to, I lost weight, I waited 6 months for them to do the test development (where I also learned I had fertility issues), I waited another 4 months for my natural period to be strong and natural.

I listened when they told me not to be overly concerned because IVF was going to be my best option with my numbers. 

I believed them and I gave them one year and a half of my life, avoid trying to get pregnant, duly waiting for them to do their part. 

And now this happens. 

I am so angry and I am hurting so bad that I cannot even find the words to describe it. 

And I know it is not their fault, their team is pretty good, but fucking hell I would like to hit them all physically at the moment. 

I think I will need to take some time out from everything and decide what I want to do next.
