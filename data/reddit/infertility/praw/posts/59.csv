I'm hoping to start my first round of IVF in early July. I now have a few appointments coming up to get some outdated tests redone plus all of the regular doctor appointments and monitoring that will come with IVF itself. I also have an old injury acting up that I'll probably need to do physical therapy for for a couple months. 

With all of these appointments to plan around, I will have to give my employer a heads up about what is happening. I don't particularly care to talk to my boss about any of this. We don't have an easy relationship, some of his superiors might find out and they can be a little gossipy, and so on. I've decided to go directly to our HR department to talk to them. 

My game plan is basically to say I have multiple medical appointments coming up, in some cases these appointments will be difficult to plan more than a day or two in advance, that I need HR to handle any concerns my boss/department have about the scheduling flexibility I'm requesting, and that I can bring in documentation from my doctors if necessary. I'm not even sure I want to tell them this is IVF related if I don't absolutely have to. I err on the side of letting my employer know as little as possible about my personal life especially when it might make them want to find some reason to fire me.

We  both independently moved to the same large city to pursue our careers  and although we both sewed our wild oats so to speak and dated others  while we did the break up/make up thing many times in our early  twenties, we eventually realized that we kept coming back to each other  and that it was time to get serious and work on being a committed  couple. We worked through the little petty dating issues left over from  being young and immature and eventually moved in together.

After  a few years of living together we got engaged and a year after that we  were married. As nervous as I was about starting a family we started  trying soon after getting married. After a year of trying we ran into  some fertility red flags. We also decided to move out of the big city  and back to where we had grown up in order to have family support in  starting our own.

Within the first year  of living in the suburbs, both adjusting to life not in a booming  metropolis, my wife was diagnosed with stage 4 endometriosis, this is  after several trips to the ER, surgery, recovery, then fertility  treatment to get this pregnancy happening ASAP leading to multiple IUIs  and then IVF to then a pregnancy, but then a crushing miscarriage to  then another round of IVF  and then an internal infection where she was  in the hospital recovering for nearly a month. Needless to say, it’s  been an absolute nightmare of a year.

We’re  now almost a year after the month recovery in the hospital. She has  been feeling better physically but after going back to trying naturally  we still haven’t achieved conception yet. This coupled with the grief of  her miscarriage and a perceived perpetual monthly failure has really  pushed us to our relationship limit. Although what gets me through is  that I firmly believe that everything we’ve gotten through together has  made us stronger as a couple. She’s also handled herself and her own  anxiety/depression unbelievably gracefully.

There  is a side story here where also in this year from hell my sister in law  also became disabled and my wife has become her unofficial 2\-3 time a  week care giver because she is a selfless compassionate soul sometimes  to a fault.

If you’ve gotten this far,  thank you for sticking with me. Here’s where I could use some group  think crowd/peer review of our situation.

Naturally,  given the nature of my wife’s condition, sex is painful for her and is  now inextricably linked with mechanical regimented baby making sex. I’m  worried that she’ll never be enthusiastic about sex ever again. It’s  already been at least a few years since I’ve felt I was being heard and  that my needs were being met in the bedroom. But it never felt important  enough in comparison to other issues for me to have any room to  complain. Especially because I love her regardless. However, I’ve become  increasingly dissatisfied with the relationship as a whole. We’ve  become room mates, literally separate rooms, I feel like we can’t live  without each other but feel my happiness doesn’t really matter. All  that’s mattered our entire marriage is getting pregnant.

I’m  now extra worried that having a child won’t make this situation any  better. We’re now getting to the point of discussing an egg donor  scenario and I don’t think I can go through with it. It’s such a massive  financial undertaking only to potentially remain unhappy or worse.

43,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"TRIGGER WARNING: previous IVF success mentioned (relevant to the question)

We have done fresh IVF transfers twice and both were a success (with one infant loss that had nothing to do with IVF). We had embryos left over from our second IVF that were all A or B grade and PGS normal. We thawed one to do an FET, it failed, we thawed another, it failed, we thawed a third, it revived but turned into a chemical pregnancy. So basically, all of our success has been with fresh and our frozen stuff has been a failure. My clinic thawed another embryo from IVF 1 and it failed, too (which is why we had to move on to IVF 2). So we've had them thaw 4 embryos and 3 failed to thaw, then the last failed as a pregnancy.

We are doing our third IVF cycle with planned fresh transfer on Saturday. But what to do with the rest of the embryos? We have two options:

1) Have our current clinic biopsy the remaining embryos for PGS and freeze for the future or if this fresh transfer fails.

2) Forego the biopsy and freeze the eggs, then transfer them to a competing clinic. They will take the embryos (*as long as they haven't been biopsied*), thaw them, do their own in-house PGS testing, and refreeze. 

I met with the competing clinic today. They confirmed what I've been hearing: that my current clinic is better for fresh than frozen. Their lab is just not as strong. My current RE has even said that he doesn't advise that embryos get biopsied, he seemed uncomfortable that we wanted to do PGS. Maybe he doesn't trust his own lab? 

The new RE I met with today scared me further by saying that, sometimes, when you have such bad outcomes with several embryos from a single batch, there was likely a lab error that affected the whole group. And biopsy is the place where things most often go wrong. I don't believe she was motivated by wanting to earn my business--she didn't really want to take my embryos because she wouldn't have control over their origin. She reluctantly agreed. She said she's had a thaw rate of 98% and can count on one hand how many embryos have failed to thaw in three years. That's as many as I've lost personally!

My remaining 11-13 embryos will be ready on Saturday. I do not want to risk some lab error compromising all of them. We've had three frozen failures from IVF 2 and one from IVF 1. I've been working too hard to make these embryos, I don't want them in hands I don't trust. We didn't know better three years ago, when we started. 

On the other hand, freezing, transferring to the new clinic, thawing, biopsy, freezing, and thawing again for use...that's a lot of manipulation. That's the only way we'll be able to use them at the new clinic. Should I just stick to the old clinic and trust them to do a better job? Or should I take a risk and maybe improve our outcome with a clinic that's very lab-focused?

The only thing I need to decide right now is ""biopsy or not?"" If I biopsy them, I'll get PGS results very quickly. But I will be locked out of potentially moving to the new clinic down the line, and the biopsy could render the embryos useless, like it may have in the past.

TL:DR: In my experience, my clinic runs a lab/freezer of death. I've had terrible outcomes with frozen (3 out of 4 thawed embryos died, FET failed). Should I move my upcoming embryos to a competing clinic? They will be frozen on Saturday.

UPDATE: We have decided to freeze all of the embryos without biopsy. This will allow us to thaw them later at our clinic or thaw/biopsy/refreeze at the new clinic. I spoke to the embryologist this morning and she inadvertently gave me a good argument for doing it this way: ""If the embryos can survive the thaw/biopsy/refreeze/thaw process, they are going to be very hearty embryos."" Those are probably more likely to result in pregnancy. So this is a risk we want to take. For now, we are going to go as light as possible on manipulation of the embryos.

We are starting a pretty conservative treatment plan with my next cycle (well, cycle after that because we will be on vacation most likely when monitoring would occur). I just had some questions that I definitely should have asked my doctor but I was kind of overwhelmed.  

Background is that my husband and I are both 30. I had two early losses in a row, four months apart. We are both otherwise healthy.  

My husband's semen analysis showed a morphology of 2%, which I understand is low, but a count of 96 million. The RE said that he's not concerned about the morphology overall because the count and motility were good. My estrogen and FSH were low, although he didn't provide numbers. All of our other labs were normal. My HSG was great, apparently, and after undergoing the Counsyl genetic testing, there aren't any major genetic syndromes we need to worry about (for which they can test, that is).  

I explained that I'm worried that I've been having anovulatory cycles, as I track my ovulation. Sometimes I do catch a positive around day 18/19, but it's really hit or miss. The doctor suggested starting Clomid with my next cycle, which sounds like a good plan, because he doesn't think we need to jump into IUI or IVF immediately. Of course, the next time my cycle is supposed to happen, we are going to be several states away, but he did say to come in when we got back anyway to have an ultrasound to look at my follicles, I guess.  

So, does this sound too conservative? I'm OK with not jumping into anything more extreme yet and trying naturally for a few months with the Clomid. Also, I was wondering if there was a place I could post photos of ovulation tests and see if someone could maybe guess if I've ovulated or not?

After doing some reading it sounds like keto is actually very good for egg quality. Does anyone have any first hand experience with this by chance? Did you actually see a difference in egg quality? 

Hell, one post I read stated their fertility doctor won’t do a retrieval without the couple or person doing a low carb/keto diet for 90 days first.

I’m 36, we’ve been trying for a 1.5 years and I learned in December I wasn’t ovulating.  I started Clomid, then letrozol and had an iui last month.  My cycles vary in length and I never know when I am going to ovulate.  

My doctor has an accent.  I asked him last week if we could get a little more aggressive seeing as I dont have many eggs left.  He was running late for surgery and took me to the front desk.  He told the nurse to submit for a Prior Auth for IVF and for the injectibles (Gonal whatever)

He put me on Clomid again and bumped it to 100mg.  The nurse said that I have been ovulating earlier than expected so they’re having me come in on day 10 for an ultrasound (Friday) so that they can give me an injection to delay ovulation and allow my follicles more time to grow?

I don't want to upset anyone, I will be mentioning my losses

I'm 30 yrs old, have had 4 early losses before 10 weeks and now two ectopic pregnancies  (neither of which were confirmed in my tubes and the most recent was suspected to be an abdominal pregnancy)....this most recent one was after medicated donor IUI cycle with a trigger shot.

I just had my follow up with the doctor for the most recent ectopic, and after two double doses of methotrexate my numbers started to go down, but not as fast as they like to see so ill be the blood draw queen for the next few weeks with my fingers crossed that I reach 0 within 3 weeks because I don't even know what happens after that...

And the doctor has just diagnosed me with something about my tubes not functioning and he recommended removing both of my tubes because he thinks it's too dangerous for me to get pregnant again.

I've asked for a second opinion and to be seen and review my case with the doctor that did my HSG after my first ectopic who said everything looked fine.

<p>I just had my follow up with the doctor for the most recent ectopic, and after two double doses of methotrexate my numbers started to go down, but not as fast as they like to see so ill be the blood draw queen for the next few weeks with my fingers crossed that I reach 0 within 3 weeks because I don&#39;t even know what happens after that...</p>

<p>And the doctor has just diagnosed me with something about my tubes not functioning and he recommended removing both of my tubes because he thinks it&#39;s too dangerous for me to get pregnant again.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked for a second opinion and to be seen and review my case with the doctor that did my HSG after my first ectopic who said everything looked fine.</p>

114,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Long back story to how I got here.

I live in a mandated state so my insurance pays for 4 retrievals. My insurance is an HMO though so I have two options for clinics. One is a large, multi-clinic, multi-doctor one, and one is a small, single RE practice.

I started with the large clinic. The doctor was okay, but the staff--nursing, front desk, billing, medical records, etc--where completely incompetent. I felt so stressed out trying to baby sit them and what they were doing. We did 1 retrieval there which ended with us getting 23 eggs, 13 mature, 3 blasts in the end. Our DX is male factor, everything checking out fine with me. We had 2 CP from a fresh and then FET and started a 3rd cycle which got cancelled and we decided to take our last embryo to the new clinic and see if life was better there.

Initially, I was really happy with the other practice. The RE seems to really have a plan for ME, rather than just a set of plans they go down the line and try. We tried a new protocol for the 1st retrieval with him and it went okay. 7 mature eggs but only 1 blast although when we did PGS, that embryo was normal, the one we transferred was not.

So, we skipped one cycle and then did another cycle on the same protocol the first clinic did although he gave me monster doses of gonal f (150 start and 300 max before vs 600 start and 750 max now). My last monitoring was today and my right ovary appears to be unreachable because it's too high so they don't think they can get those eggs, and my left only has 4 follicles over 10. They admitted this cycle was not as good as the last and they think we should freeze all at day 2 and then do another retrieval with a brand new protocol. 

I told them I can't do another retrieval right now. First, I'm worn out. Second, we only have 1 shot left. I'm not ready to rush into that without more thought and consideration. I don't understand why I responded so poorly this cycle when I did so well on it the first time. I can't help but think it's his dosing and I don't understand WHY he dosed so high. This clinic has been so much easier to work with and more efficient, but if I'm not getting eggs and embryos it's not worth it. I just don't get how the numbers changed so much from one place to another. I don't think it's me. My AMH hasn't gone down and I did some other test out of pocket with my ovarian reserve and it came back as good for my age (31). With my husband's sperm issues we need as many eggs as possible and 4 just isn't going to cut it.

I'm not sure what to do. Stick with the competent clinic that gets no results one more time, switch back to the clinic that made me nuts but at least worked out numbers wise, or switch jobs to switch insurances to take a risk with my last cycle at a new clinic. None of the options seem very good right now. 

I also don't know if I should tell them to just grow these to blast and see what happens since I'm not sure what the future holds with the clinic.

Tech said I had 4 on my left ovary the size the RE would retrieve but my right ovary wasn’t visible. They did the external scan and it’s basically above my uterus which she said would make it very hard to get to for egg retrieval. My ovaries have always been hiders but they have never found them in the area it was today. She was scanning my abdomen essentially. Is there anything that can be really done to get this guy down? I’m not sure if trying to be more active today will help gravity bring it down or try to do a bowel prep or something? I don’t want to have gone through all this for possibly one or no embryos And I really do feel like physically and mentally I’m not sure another stim is in our future.

EDIT: well just got the call. They are triggering me tonight and just gonna go after the 4 unless the ovary move still on it’s own. They said this cycle wasn’t as good as the last (and that cycle wasn’t a as I’d as much  to old clinic so the debate of switching back is looming in my mind). They want to do a freeze all at day 2 and do another cycle before they PGS with a new protocol. Our plan was to transfer our 1 PGS afternoon this and I told them I am sticking to that.

It’d been years since we really talked but we fell back into the same friendship. Fast forward to my engagement, I chose her as my MOH. Turns out, she has never had a good relationship and she got super jealous and purposely wrecked my bachelorette weekend in a really ugly way. 

She apologized after and admitted that she did the things she did because she was jealous and wished she could go back and change things long story short. We’ve been on the mend but I’ve stayed guarded. She knew husband and I were trying on the honeymoon in July of last year and have been trying since. We went to the OBGYN in Dec and I was put back on BC to regulate my cycle then taken off and started Clomid last month. 

A month before starting Clomid she told me she would feel so left out and would be jealous if I got pregnant. I wasnt quite sure how to react but told her that’s the wrong reason to want a child and talked about how long my husband and I had been waiting until we could be in a position to get married and have a child.

Right when I started Clomid she came to me and told me that after that discussion she stopped taking her BC and the current guy she has been sleeping with didn’t know so he wasn’t being careful so now she is pregnant. She moved in with this random guy and talked about how he has been sleeping with these other girls since...

NOW, every day at work she is talking about cribs, gender reveal party ideas, Johnson & Johnson vs. Aveeno.. I feel like I am losing my mind trying to suppress this at work. EVERYBODY and their mom stops by her desk (right next to mine) to tell her congrats and what baby names is she thinking... our workplace is a smaller company though so “going to HR” isn’t really an option, switching jobs isn’t an option, and she seems to not understand when I blatantly tell her that I don’t want to talk or hear about baby stuff.

She keeps asking me “if you were pregnant, which would you do for your baby?” My reply: I don’t want to think about that. I am still trying and dealing with infertility issues. Then she offers words of encouragement. I genuinely don’t think she is trying to be malicious, I think she just can’t see past herself sometimes...? The crazy irrational me wants to believe this is her trying to one up me for getting married?

I feel like I am living my worst nightmare. I feel like I can’t trust my own logic because I am so disappointed and upset about my own fertility and fear of not having children. Any words of kind but honest advice?

Me: 38, diminished ovarian reserve \(DOR\). AMH=0.19, TSH=3.2 in February 2018; started 25mcg Levothyroxine to lower TSH to 1.43 at last draw; HSG indicated left tube blocked where it joins uterus, otherwise fine. Possible mild endo based on symptoms. No other labs.

Partner: 47, 3&#37; morphology, no other known issues.

We officially started trying to conceive via cycle charting and timing in July 2017; had not been preventing pregnancy for about 2 years before that. I've never been pregnant or had a positive pregnancy test.

**First Medicated Timed** **Intercourse \(TI\)** **Cycle**

Currently on CD 15 of a medicated TI cycle with 300 iu Follistim. Why the hell am I doing TI? My insurance is complete crap and that's all it will cover related to infertility. So I figured I'd make them pay for at least one cycle while we get an idea of my response to meds before forking over insane sums of money out of pocket for a trial and error project.

CD 2 Baseline—one 14mm ""cyst"" and no other follicles. No blood work. Cleared to start 300 iu Follistim on CD 3.

CD 8 Monitoring—one 24mm ""follicle"" \(formerly known as ""cyst""\) and no other follicles. Lining is tri\-laminar at 6mm. No blood work. Told to trigger that night with Ovidrel and start progesterone suppositories on CD 12.

**WTF?**

Has anyone else with DOR experienced a single 10\+mm follicle at baseline? What does that even mean? I've heard that with DOR sometimes the brain and ovaries are screaming at each other, so that's the only thing I can think of to explain it—maybe my ovaries are like, ""Hey, let's get this show on the road!"" before my brain even knows what's up, and by the time my period rolls around they've already taken off.

I've thought of a bunch of questions for my RE, but I'm not sure if I'm asking the right things. Can someone with more experience weigh in? What would you ask? And what kinds answers would you consider to be red flags or good signs?

This is what I have so far:

* Why wasn't any blood work done at baseline to measure hormone levels? How would we know if this was a cyst vs. a follicle?
* Based on this cycle, where it seemed that I had a cyst or dominant follicle at baseline, can you explain why this happens? What do you recommend as next steps?
* My lining was tri\-laminar but only 6mm at trigger. This seems less than ideal. What do you recommend for this?
* What  are your thoughts on DHEA? I've read several papers that indicate it  may be beneficial in cases of diminished ovarian reserve.
* If we consider IVF, what type of protocol do you  recommend for a more favorable result?",t2_1fg9c8xj,False,,0,False,What Would You Do—Next Steps after Injectable Cycle with DOR and Early Recruitment,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8lv64f,False,dark,1.0,,public,6,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice,False,6,,False,self,1527252345.0,,[],{},,True,,1527217042.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><strong>Background</strong></p>

The day before your transfer, we see if the embryos are ready for biopsy. We biopsy them and send the biopsied samples off on the same day. We receive the PGS results the next day, which is the same day as the transfer. The risks with this option is if the embryos are not ready when we check on them, then we have nothing to send to the PGS lab, and the transfer can still proceed without any PGS testing or the transfer is cancelled."", 'author_fullname': 't2_1fhf2zws', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': '[TX] An exotic animal truck hit the facility where our embryos were developing.', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/legaladvice', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_8ll9ae', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.93, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 417, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 417, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': 1527185861.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1527125626.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.legaladvice', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Location: Dallas, Texas</p>\n\n<p>My wife and I have been trying to have a child for the last year through a fertility clinic.

Has anyone had an ectopic that had slowly rising hcg that eventually deteriorated on its own? I just want it out of me so I can start gearing up for my next transfer!</p>

173,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Listened to this great interview today. 

Liz was a professional Australian netball player who parlayed her charisma and quick wit into a bit of a TV career. I’d listen to her talking about just about anything. 

Liz has written a guide to fertility treatment called ‘if at first you don’t conceive’, which gets 5/5 for its name. She was interviewed by Mia Freedman, a media mogul/journalist who owns Australia’s biggest women’s media company. 

The fertility stuff comes up about halfway through the interview, and it’s a really great frank and open discussion between two women who have both experienced treatment for secondary fertility, and miscarriages. Their conversation about the latter was really touching. The interview goes down many rabbit holes (incl talking with other people about fertility issues, dealing with the feeling that your body is letting you down, being successful in other areas of life but struggling with this, etc). It’s the kind of interview that I wish the Beat Infertility host could conduct—it’s not based on scripted questions, and follows its own course.

The book draws on Liz’s own ART/IVF treatment but seems to be based largely on interviews with lots of people who’ve had different experiences. She seems to have some really solid advice on a few issues that I don’t see set out clearly in many places — two things she says are super important to do upfront are talk about (edit) where the end point might be (when you’ll decide enough treatment is enough), and make plans for two potential futures (with and without success).

I also heard her interviewed on another podcast (Conversations) but this was better—im not usually a fan of Mia freedman but she really brought a lot to this one. I’m keen to read the book now.

Spoiler/CW: Liz’s second kiddo was conceived after they gave up on IVF, so there’s THAT. But it’s not at all one of those hyper-happy just relax kind of things.

I don't want to upset anyone so please pardon the discussion of a pregnancy, but I need some support.


3+ years trying, 4 early miscairrages, 1 ectopic pregnancy, a litany of tests all coming up that both my husband and I are perfectly healthy, and no explanation of why I couldn't seem to carry beyond 10 weeks lead us to try IUI in April with a sperm donor with the hopes that some fresh DNA might help the situation. 

We had success, but my numbers were extremely low given that we knew conception date due to using medicated IUI with a trigger shot and my husband and I were abstaining.

they continued to double every three days though so the doc was being hopeful.

When I finally got over 1,500 they couldn't see anything in my uterus my lining was only at 7mm and there was no sign of a pregnancy. they decided is was a second ectopic pregnancy and sent me for methotrexate. two days later my numbers went up again so I got a second dose. three days later my number went up again so they pulled me in for a visit.

at this point I was just over 4,000....the thing is they STILL couldn't find the pregnancy, not even in my tubes...no fluid, no bleeding, nothing visualized on an ultrasound and blood flow wasn't a help either...

I completely baffled the doctors and they said they can't surgically remove it until they can see it somehow to know where to cut. after a meeting of ALL of the office doctors and a call into a specialist im Boston, MA that deals exclusively with high risk and rare pregnancies, they have decided this has to be an abdominal pregnancy which is incredibly rare, and decided since I'm not in pain to give it two more days and test me again to see if my numbers stop going up and the drugs just needed more time to work, or otherwise send me for an MRI so they can plan a surgery. 

And the nurse practitioner warned me that I need to think about ""long term birth control options"" because with two pregnancies outside of my uterus I'm at a much higher risk of more and causing even more damage to my body. fuck her by the way.

I have no idea how common it is to have the methotrexate not work, or for it to take more than a week to start working, but I'm a freaking mess right now.

I have been walking around trying to deal with my 6th pregnancy loss, potential permenant infertility all with this pregnancy still inside me and I've been a wreck. And anyone I tell for support is pretty blinded by the curiosity of it that I'm left not only still sad, but unsupported and like a science experiment.

Ireland is holding a referendum this Friday on Repealing the 8th Amendment to our constitution which currently states that an unborn foetus has the same rights as the woman carrying it. Effectively this makes abortion illegal under ANY circumstances (including fatal abnormalities and pregnancy from rape) and has a penalty of up to 14 years in prison for any woman who attempts one on Irish soil. The vote on Friday is to repeal this, allowing the government to legalise abortion. Most medical doctors are in favour of Repeal and the UN and Amnesty has stated that current law is against human rights but needles to say this debate has got ugly. 

I want to stress I do not mean to push a political agenda here - and if this gets taken down, fine, but it is just so upsetting to have to see this while dealing with IF, and I really need to rant about it.

There are posters EVERYWHERE, there are people calling to my door, there are ads popping up even when I'm on fertility sites. What's so upsetting is some of the notices on the 'No' posters that give such insanely incorrect information. Like 'at 9wks a baby can kick and suck it's thumb' or 'a heartbeat can be detected at 22days'. DAYS!!!!
I've been suffering from IF for ~6years, had a loss at 9wks last year after ivf and am now trying ivf again but this crap in my face is just so unbelievably upsetting. I can't walk my dog or go online or even sit peacefully in my house without having it shoved in my face.

197,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello pals, 

I'm having a really hard day today and I find sharing with you all to be soothing. So I'm just going to go off. If you have anything to co-vent about, I'd love to hear it! 

1. I very recently (April) left my old company and started with a new company because of lack of advancement opportunities, despite putting in countless hours and literally doing the work of 2 people (a girl quit about 6 months prior and I took over her duties). Today I got a text from a friend/old coworker that she was given a huge promotion and a subordinate, even though I had been there longer, worked more hours and had a bigger project load. This job didn't even exist, it was tailor-made for her. She's 23 years old, lives with her parents, is on her parents' insurance, doesn't pay for groceries, etc etc. I know none of those details have anything to do with her job performance, but it certainly makes it sting more. 

2. Last week I was back to eating nice&clean and was excited to hop on the scale on Saturday, to see ive gained half a pound. I understand that can be water weight, bloat, nothing at all, but if any of you have pcos I'm sure you can understand how frustrating weight loss is. All the Lose It threads just spout CICO and say people blaming hormone problems are just fat people in denial that don't want to change. I can honest-to-God tell you that I can go weeks eating 1200 calories and heavy cardio and either gain weight, or remain the same weight. Last year I did an 8 week boot camp course with a gal from work who had about 20 pounds to lose. I have about 40 pounds to lose. She lost 15 pounds and I gained 1. It is honestly infuriating to do the exact same workouts as a relatively skinny girl, have as good as or better diet, and be blown out of the water by their weight loss. 

3. Infertility + PCOS is just a fucking roller coaster and I hate it. I can't give my perfectly healthy husband any children naturally. If I want a chance, I'll have to go through IVF who knows how many more times (already did 1 and it completely faied) and then it still may fail. Unless you've experienced it, you don't know the frustration and shame of taking a shower and looking down and realizing you need to shave your chest, again this week. 

4. I feel like I may be teetering with depression but don't know how to address it. I've always had emotional issues because I had a very rough childhood with an abusive mother, but I can usually keep it relatively in check. But taking all of these fucking supplements and vitamins and medications to try to have a baby, coupled with the life long struggle with my weight, coupled with feeling inadequate job wise is just so much. It feels like I'll never be enough and there's no point in attempting to be.

They sent it to the pharmacy yesterday. I took it at 4:30 today & it kicked in just in time. I went into the room with a raised table & a big circular X-ray machine centered over the table. I was given the standard 'sheet"". The nurse came in after I positioned myself on the table & strapped my legs into these stirrups with padded edges. Then she explain the entire procedure, step by step. My doctor came in & greeted me, and made a few jokes. I asked him some questions & he reassured me that I would feel fine tomorrow even if my tubes were blocked. My doctor inserted a speculum & cleaned my cervix with a q-tip. Then he sprayed numbing gel in there. It STUNG BAD. Just imagine alcohol pad on a skinned knee. Then it completely subsided 30 seconds at most. He asked me to cough hard & when he did, he injected more numbing medicine into my cervix. I felt it, it pinched, then it was over. 

Then he told me he was going to inject the dye. I asked the nurse if I could hold her hand. I was TERRIFIED. He asked me to cough hard again & inserted the catheter. Then he pushed the dye. It was AWFUL. I'm not gonna lie to you. Imagine getting kicked in the uterus on the worst day of your period. I let loose a ton of expletives. He took a ton of photos & I could feel it penetrating my entire abdomen. He asked me to turn on my right side because the dye wasn't coming out of my right tube. It felt like I laid on a pile of sharp HOT rocks. Then it was over. He removed the speculum, and let the dye run out & the pressure stopped.

It took all of 15 minutes. My tubes are CLEAR! I was crying with relief. He showed the X-RAYS to me & said that the dye came immediately out of my left tube, but started to pool on my right due to scar tissue. Once he had me turn on my side it all came out! I have no fibroids either! 

It's now 5 hours after my exam. I still have bad period type cramps on my front abdomen & lower back & a little bleeding. Spotting really. I have taken 800mg of ibuprofen & a muscle relaxer. 

If you're scared, don't be! You're allowed to be anxious, due to the fear of the 'unknown'. Trust me, I was shaking & crying & I was even on valium. But I promise you, good or bad results the stress of not knowing will go away!!

I was in some kind of shock so I didn't know what to ask and didn't absorb info. Recovery has been super easy, although I've been trying to relax and take care of myself. Honestly, the experience was not as traumatic as it would have been because I have great doctors. D &C around week 8, although I think pregnancy ended around week 6. 

Here are my questions-
1) when will I get my period now? Is the D & C like day 1 of my cycle? I assume I will likely ovulate late, won't I? I usually ovulate around day 14- I'm assuming it could be a few extra weeks. I guess I still have HCG in my system so this could take a while, no? I had a laparoscopy a few years ago and that really delayed my ovulation significantly- obviously your body is dealing w/ a lot.

2) Can I resume regular activity now? I feel fine. I really want to get back in shape and start to run a bit. I will start with walking because  it is going to help me deal with this situation.

3) It seems safest to stop trying for this cycle but doctor did mention we could get back into the game next cycle. I'll check back with my RE beginning of next cycle and I'll have my follow up then w/ doctor who did D & C before then too to make sure, just wanted to hear about how this usually goes.

On top of my infertility struggles, I also have ongoing struggles with my father and his mental health issues.  Course...seems like all of us don't get to just deal with infertility...many of us all have other major shit going on in our lives as well.

You ever just get to a point where you just would rather stay home?  Invites to happy hours or other social events (even those with no kids) just seem like something you would rather not go to?  Find yourself making excuses to your friends about why you can't go?  

That is where I'm at...at least for this weekend, maybe longer.  After a crappy week full of stress from both the infertility side and from my dad...I just want to stay home this weekend.  Went to a brunch yesterday with 2 girlfriends and felt like I needed a nap when I got home I was so exhausted from trying to fake being happy.  One girl is so pregnant she is about to pop and was of course talking about that, the other talking about all the places her and her husband are traveling to this summer. Felt like a huge debbie downer when the conversation steered towards me cause it was basically ""Yep, my life still sucks at the moment"".  

Hopefully this is just temporary and my mind's way of telling me I just need some time to myself to just decompress and relax. Hopefully my group of friends can understand and don't take it personally if I don't want to meet up with them for our usual happy hours(most of them are late 30s/40s and single with no children and don't ever want them). Anyone else can relate? What helped you to come around?

<p>Anyways....my nurse calls me Thursday telling me that my TSH is too high. It is 3.083 and they want it to be 2.5 or less to do IVF. So I had to scramble around to get an appointment with my PCP&#39;s office Friday and get started on levothyroxine 12.5 mcg every OTHER day(took first dose this am). They don&#39;t want to over correct me is what my PCP told me. </p>

<p>From what the fertility nurse and my PCP tell me...sounds like no way in hell will I be able to start my IVF cycle as planned (was supposed to start meds June 2 if my saline sonogram was ok).</p>

<p>Those that had something similar happen....how long did this set you back?  I mean...I&#39;m only doing one cycle of IVF so whatever I need to do to increase the odds of success I will.  It just sucks waiting longer to start. Especially at my age. </p>

Backstory
Did my first IVF round last fall (I was 39.  All good labs and sperm except I have DOR/ low AMH) that I paid for entirely out of pocket (while husband is a full time law school student).  I did mini stim. Had 3 eggs -2 embryos fertilized.  We transferred 2 at day 3 and one took.  I had an early MC due to poor egg quality with 3 diff chromosomal abnormalities.  I was laid off about 2 months later right before Christmas (second layoff for me in 2017).  2017 was stellar.  I got a new job in March ‘18 with IF coverage.  My coverage is unlimited as my company is in Massachusetts (having paid for the first cycle myself I am SO grateful).  Since I’m 40, Aetna just needs day 3 FSH under 19.  Mine was under 10 last week.  So... just waiting on my prior auth right now.
 
Issue/ Question
I learned yesterday from Aetna that if I end up with 5 or more day 3 embryos OR 3 or more day 5 embryos, I MUST do a transfer in order to do another IVF round.  I know I didn’t even get 5 day 3 embryos before (on mini stim), but since I have coverage, we’re doubling Gonal-F to 300 iu a day, 150 Menopur and adding in microdose Lupron 2x a day in hopes of better numbers (and quality).

Originally, I was hoping to do a few retrievals, PGS test (paying out of my own pocket) and then transfer only if I get normals, to avoid another heartbreaking miscarriage.  I’d even be willing to share PGS results with Aetna... in the end, it would cost them even more with all the D&C’s than letting me transfer normal embryos (I know normals aren’t a guarantee).

Now.... with this new news... I'm not sure how to proceed.  No idea if this has to be a fresh transfer...

Has anyone had luck appealing this requirement? given my history of miscarriage... it's only been one... plus my age... I’m sure I have WAY more abnormals than normals at this point.  

Why would anyone transfer an abnormal embryo if they didn’t have to?  

Just when I thought I was close to trying again.... grateful for the coverage but really don’t understand the rationale...

Sorry for the novel.  And thanks for any feedback, advice, whatever.

For those following along at home (or reading my stand-alone post history), you might recall that the nurses and office staff at my clinic are well-meaning but completely disorganized, and that my first RE's inattention to detail benched us for a cycle when she miscalculated my ovulation date. At that point, we got a second opinion from a DOR expert at another clinic - who said that she wouldn't necessarily diagnose DOR until she saw how I responded to stims. We ultimately decided to go ahead with IVF at our original clinic, but switched to a second RE there (whom we absolutely loved for his bedside manner).

Fast-forward through our complete failure of an IVF cycle that definitively confirmed my DOR diagnosis, and we have decided to pull the trigger and switch to the DOR expert (clinic #2, RE #3).

We had a consult with her yesterday that gave us back a very very tiny bit of hope. 

In reviewing the records from our failed cycle, and RE #2's suggestion that we next try metformin (despite my GI disorder, and the fact that I don't have PCOS) along with microdose lupron, she said, ""it's not exactly medical malpractice... but I think that's a terrible idea."" Instead, she suggested the following:

1. Stick with DHEA, CoQ10, and an estrogen-primed antagonist protocol (which she considers to be more aggressive than microdose lupron) -  but lower the stim dose. She thinks I over-stimmed on my last cycle, and essentially wasted money (and possibly hurt egg quality).

2. Add clomid and letrozole, to stimulate my ovaries in multiple ways all at once (this sounds fun 😳). She said that this is a protocol developed by a researcher at NYU particularly for women with stats similar to mine, and that both clinics have seen good results with it. 

3. She said I would be a prime candidate for HGH, given my okayish AFC and decent response to stims, but terrible egg quality. (This was her strongest recommendation, but is something my first clinic wouldn't even consider when I asked about it!)

4. Use a dual trigger to help the smaller follicles to mature.

5. She agreed with my decision to switch from folic acid to methylfolate on account of my compound heterozygous MTHFR mutation (which I discovered myself through 23andMe and Genetic Genie, and which my first two REs admitted they know nothing about). 

6. She also agreed with my decision to start vitamin E. It's recommended by *It Starts with an Egg* for egg quality, but is also a blood thinner - so makes sense for me, given the MTHFR mutation and the fact that I can't take baby aspirin on account of my IBD.

7. We're going to do the Episona Sperm Test on my husband. Even though his counts look good, we're worried there could be a problem on his end because his only two uncles are infertile (but are too private to be willing to share details). We want to be absolutely certain that there's nothing wrong with his sperm DNA before we spend any more time, energy, and money on my eggs.

All of that is the good news - basically, we feel that switching doctors, protocols, and labs means that we're trying absolutely everything we can. We're hoping that we get better results, but even if we don't, it will hopefully give us the sense of closure we'll need in order to move forward with Plan B.

The bad news is that the new clinic's lab shuts down for cleaning for the entire month of June, so we'll have to wait two cycles instead of one before we can get started. My husband is really sad about another month of waiting, and I'm kind of bummed about the prospect of being bloated and chained to a fertility clinic during prime vacation/beach season. However, I'm trying to look on the bright side - this gives us a bit of extra time for my new supplements to hopefully do something, and I can enjoy my body being back to normal for 6 weeks before starting stims again (today I am *7 pounds lighter* than I was 16 days ago!).",t2_dfo13,False,,0,False,Update - We're switching clinics!,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8km2i4,False,dark,0.94,,public,16,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,16,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1526773757.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>We&#39;re switching clinics!</p>

A bit of a heads up, I'm trans, if you're not cool with that then I guess don't read on.

So, I've been battling with being trans since puberty and at age 26 I finally built up the courage to take the plunge and transition. I'm now a year into HRT and it was the best decision I ever made. For context, I was born male and am transitioning to female. 

However the more I realise this is who I'm supposed to be and become more comfortable as a woman, the more I'm reminded that I can never be a biological mother. I have great difficulty trying to deal with this and I honestly don't know how to overcome it. I am frequently brought to tears by the thought of motherhood and I feel like I'm sinking back into depression because of this.

Any advice or if you can at least point me in the right direction would be great, thanks.

I have never been a smoker, but much literature seems to study the length of time it takes men's sperm to improve after quitting smoking (a figure cited seems to often be 1-2 years), but I haven't been able to find equivalent information for women.

What I have not been able to find is if the changes in gene expression (such as BAD) and all of the other biological changes (follicular, etc.) are permanent or whether they are reversed/improved after quitting smoking. And if those negative changes can be reversed, how long the process might typically take after quitting. I'm probably looking for the impossible: the equivalent of the data that is available for men (the 1-2 year example).

My wife is 38 and smoked for 15 years (3-5 per day) and has been 100% tobacco free for about 18 months (since marrying me). In a previous marriage, she had one child naturally at age 20 (before she ever smoked), but since then has not been able to have children.

These were all with her former spouse.

At this point we're wondering if there is any realistic chance that she would be able to get pregnant and carry to term, whether naturally or through IVF. I realize that smoking is only one of MANY factors impacting fertility (but a very significant one), and I also realize that her age is now going to play a very significant factor as well.

But my main question is that if hypothetically we assumed (and this is a HUGELY oversimplified assumption) that her fertility problems were caused/related to smoking (after having a child before smoking without any problems), would the damage to her reproductive system be permanent after many years of smoking, despite being completely tobacco free for 18 months?

I was wondering if any of you had some experience with a high number of abnormally fertilized eggs. My wife just completed her second cycle and out of 23 mature eggs, only 13 were fertilized successfully. While that is a good number to started out with, I am concerned about the high number of unfertilized eggs. 3 arrested and 7 were abnormally fertilized with both 1 pronuclei and 3 pronuclei. My understanding is that the 3 pronuclei abnormal embryos are due to an error in meiotic division.

We're both 27 and have been friends for about 15 years; I care about her very deeply.  I got a long series of texts from her this morning because she was having an especially hard time, basically stating that she wanted me to be her ""dump person"" who she can vent and rant to since I've been supportive in the past and have stuck by her, even when she's being consumed by her IF struggle, as well as listen to and validate her feelings/thoughts.

She's been going through fertility treatments and actively trying to conceive for about six years, with a break for the past year due to success with treatment.  Last month was her first back on the treatments, and she is spotting already. She described it as her personally ""failing again"".  I think another reason she wants me to be there for her during all this is that she said most people say to her ""Well at least you have one"" and then dismiss it, and I have never and would never say that to her.  I responded that her sadness over this is entirely separate from her previous success, which took five years.  She's had four or five miscarriages, one after she had announced at 16 weeks, and one other at about 14, the others were around 12 or 13.

My friend has extra stress about her infertility from her job; she works at a womens' center dealing with pregnancy.

277,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello. We're undergoing treatment for unexplained ""but you're old and that's probably why"" infertility, Clomid 100mg/LH shot + IUI. First cycle was negative result, second cycle went totally sideways. Had 2 prime follicles of the same size at time of IUI, warned of possibility of twins. Beta last week was negative, period never showed up and I am regular as clockwork - or /was/ - but my uterus has been acting like I'm in constant ovulation for the last week. Called clinic last week to say something was wrong, felt very dismissed, was told the beta was negative, to wait and period would probably show up in a few days. Called this week, they ran a progesterone on the sample from last week, it was very low and I was told I hadn't ovulated. Went in today for a diagnostic ultrasound, where they found a corpus luteum that has just started to collapse, and a developing follicle. Endometrium at 4mm. So either one of the follicles from the IUI ultrasound ovulated very late, or I somehow grew another follicle to maturity in a week, but when I asked how any of this could happen, they shrugged. The problem was definitely not ""oh you just didn't ovulate"". I was told not to expect a period this month and we could just ""try it ourselves"" this month and if I regulate after it, we'll go back to the IUI schedule. I asked whether I needed to have any hormone therapy to regulate - due to the low progesterone at the beta - and was told no. 

The doctor keeps insisting this is diminished ovarian reserve at play, and is pushing IVF very hard, and wants to do donor eggs. I am 43, so I realize that my age is a big issue. I'm not tied to my genome and eventually if we have to go IVF, that's my preferred method. My issue is that after researching diminished ovarian reserve, I can find nothing that indicates that multiple ovulation or short cycles are a thing. This was also just our second cycle, my insurance covers up to six, and I'd like to exhaust those before going on to IVF - which we would have to pay out of pocket. 

I'm just.. I'm very annoyed that multiple calls to the clinic with ""Hey my period is still missing and I feel like I've been ovulating for a week."" were met with complete dismissal, I had to push them to do a diagnostic ultrasound, we found weirdness that the doctor either can't or wouldn't explain, yet was still harping on diminishing ovarian reserve. Am I wrong to feel that if my ovaries were really in as diminished as I keep getting told they MUST BE due to my age, that they wouldn't be pitching so many follicles? 

It's been a super emotional day today, my apologies if I sound unhinged.

We&#39;re undergoing treatment for unexplained &quot;but you&#39;re old and that&#39;s probably why&quot; infertility, Clomid 100mg/LH shot + IUI. First cycle was negative result, second cycle went totally sideways. Had 2 prime follicles of the same size at time of IUI, warned of possibility of twins. Beta last week was negative, period never showed up and I am regular as clockwork - or /was/ - but my uterus has been acting like I&#39;m in constant ovulation for the last week. Called clinic last week to say something was wrong, felt very dismissed, was told the beta was negative, to wait and period would probably show up in a few days. Called this week, they ran a progesterone on the sample from last week, it was very low and I was told I hadn&#39;t ovulated. Went in today for a diagnostic ultrasound, where they found a corpus luteum that has just started to collapse, and a developing follicle. Endometrium at 4mm. So either one of the follicles from the IUI ultrasound ovulated very late, or I somehow grew another follicle to maturity in a week, but when I asked how any of this could happen, they shrugged. The problem was definitely not &quot;oh you just didn&#39;t ovulate&quot;. I was told not to expect a period this month and we could just &quot;try it ourselves&quot; this month and if I regulate after it, we&#39;ll go back to the IUI schedule. I asked whether I needed to have any hormone therapy to regulate - due to the low progesterone at the beta - and was told no. </p>

<p>The doctor keeps insisting this is diminished ovarian reserve at play, and is pushing IVF very hard, and wants to do donor eggs. I am 43, so I realize that my age is a big issue. I&#39;m not tied to my genome and eventually if we have to go IVF, that&#39;s my preferred method. My issue is that after researching diminished ovarian reserve, I can find nothing that indicates that multiple ovulation or short cycles are a thing. This was also just our second cycle, my insurance covers up to six, and I&#39;d like to exhaust those before going on to IVF - which we would have to pay out of pocket. </p>

301,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"You guys.  Baby shower season is here (what the fuck even is ""Baby Shower Season"") and if you're like me you are RSVP-ing no to invitations left and right.  

Our standard advice around here is to skip the shower and send a nice gift but holy shit there's nothing like scrolling through some fertile asshole's registry to *completely* ruin your weekend.  

I've picked up a few tricks to make this as painless as possible, so here's my guide to buying a shower gift without crying yourself to sleep (hopefully):


Step 1. Set a budget. You're going to need to be a little flexible here, but decide on a target amount to spend. You'll be paying for gift wrap and possibly shipping, so set your budget $10-$15 lower than the top end of this window.


Step 2. Find out where they're registered. If you're given the choice between, say, Babies R Us and Target go with Target. We're trying to get this done while seeing as few pictures of happy baby bullshit as possible. If you're really lucky, they might even be registered with Amazon. 


Step 3. Wait for a day when you're feeling strong and ready to knock out your to-do list. If you're already in tears, today is not that date.  


Step 4. Begin humming the Mission Impossible theme song (I am not joking) and navigate yourself to their registry. **You want to get in and get out as quickly as possible, so pretend you're being timed.**

Baby shower season is here (what the fuck even is &quot;Baby Shower Season&quot;) and if you&#39;re like me you are RSVP-ing no to invitations left and right.  </p>

<p>Our standard advice around here is to skip the shower and send a nice gift but holy shit there&#39;s nothing like scrolling through some fertile asshole&#39;s registry to <em>completely</em> ruin your weekend.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve picked up a few tricks to make this as painless as possible, so here&#39;s my guide to buying a shower gift without crying yourself to sleep (hopefully):</p>

<p>Step 1. Set a budget. You&#39;re going to need to be a little flexible here, but decide on a target amount to spend. You&#39;ll be paying for gift wrap and possibly shipping, so set your budget $10-$15 lower than the top end of this window.</p>

<p>Step 2. Find out where they&#39;re registered. If you&#39;re given the choice between, say, Babies R Us and Target go with Target. We&#39;re trying to get this done while seeing as few pictures of happy baby bullshit as possible. If you&#39;re really lucky, they might even be registered with Amazon. </p>

<p>Step 3. Wait for a day when you&#39;re feeling strong and ready to knock out your to-do list. If you&#39;re already in tears, today is not that date.  </p>

<p>Step 4. Begin humming the Mission Impossible theme song (I am not joking) and navigate yourself to their registry. <strong>You want to get in and get out as quickly as possible, so pretend you&#39;re being timed.</strong></p>

<p>Step 5. Click Sort by: Price Low to High.</p>

<p>Step 6. Looking only at the price column, scroll down until you hit the first line item that&#39;s roughly the budget you set. Click &quot;Add to Cart.&quot; If it&#39;s nipple butter, she&#39;s getting nipple butter. Whatever. She registered for it so you know she wanted it. And you don&#39;t have to be there to watch her open it, so who gives a flying fuck? </p>

<p>Step 7. Resist the temptation to look at anything else on the registry. The last thing you need is for a baby rubber duckie inflatable bath chair to send you over the edge (been there, done that).</p>

<p>Step 8. Proceed to checkout, pay for the gift wrap, and have it delivered directly to their home. Here&#39;s sample text for the card: &quot;Congratulations, I am so thrilled for you guys!

318,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello All, 

I started a new job the first week of the year, and in February i found out that i had severe PCOS(Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). My husband and i had been trying to get pregnant for a few months, with no luck. I had already been diagnosed & treated for endometriosis in the past, and i assumed i had PCOS due to several cysts bursting over the past 2 years as well as an absence of my period. I was given a blood test & they confirmed i had PCOS. 

We started Fertility Treatments on March 28th. I spoke with my boss and i let him know i may need additional time off for the appointments as well as a few days off due to possible adverse medication side effects. He said that was OK, i would just need to submit a time off request whenever i needed to go in. I made several copies of the time off request form and submitted them as soon as possible before an appointment. 

In April we went through our first round of Femara. I ended up going to the doctor a lot more than i had anticipated. During this time, i apologized to my bosses and asked if it was still OK. They said i had to do what i had to do, and to continue turning in time off forms. They were all approved. The first round ended up being a failure. 

On May 1st i was diagnosed with Flu Strain B. I'm assuming i contracted it through visiting the doctor many times. I was given a doctor's note & faxed it into the office that allowed me to come back in to work on the 4th. They texted me & told me to stay home. On May 11th my employment was terminated. They said it was due to ""Poor Performance"". I was never given any verbal or written warnings that my performance was lacking. There was never any indication that my absences were causing an issue, or causing my job performance to suffer. Even though i knew they must be. I tried to work harder and longer hours to make up for time missed. 

My question is- How do you deal with Infertility and Working? I have an interview for a new job on Wednesday and i'm wondering IF i should bring it up and when? I understand how this may pose a problem- becoming pregnant right after starting a job and then having to leave to start a family. But in all honesty, i just want to get my insulin resistance and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome side effects under control. (I.e excessive hair growth, hormonal acne, ovarian cysts). Obviously starting a family is the end goal. I am meeting with my RE tomorrow morning to discuss the possibility of after hour visits or the least amount of visits as possible. We are doing one more round of Femara, this time with an HSG test and my husband had a semen analysis and i had a blood panel done. We have decided if this round doesn't work to give it a break for a while, and perhaps start back up when i am more cemented in my job. 

Any advice is welcome. For reference, i live in Texas. It's an at will employment state. Job i was terminated from had Zero benefits.

The fertility clinic is concerned there just isn&#39;t enough time before the trip and that if we do decide to do it we would need to forgo the birth control/suppression phase and go into the stimulation phase right after my period. Is it worth it? Is birth control/suppression phase that critical to the success of IVF?</p>

<p>Thank you for any insight. </p>
