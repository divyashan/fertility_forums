I so appreciate your input to a post I made a few weeks back about our (in particular my wife's) IVF loss:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/czucii/request_care_packagegift_for_wife_suffering_ivf/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

We have made it through another few weeks, with some hours still spent in dark holes and some moments spent laughing and joyful.

We have decided for the time being (and at wifey's insistence) to start TTC with me as the carrier. Starting from scratch with home insems and hopefully IUIs. I'm in the data gathering portion of this to figure out what my fertility journey could possibly look like, while also holding space for our enormous grief around the loss of all our embryos.

Of course I fear the worst, and we all know that pregnancy is not merit based, so anything could happen. I'm just very aware of how different our experience will be starting this journey with a different body, but not a clean slate. We both know the risks of hope and optimism and excitement and want to avoid that ""toxic positivity"" while still deciding to believe it could work.

*Any words of pragmatic encouragement* or advice on how to continue caring for my sweet wife while also trying to feel some level of excitement *are welcome!*

I have so many of you in my thoughts after lurking here and seeing pain and resilience... Xx

30,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi there, I appreciate any advice.  All of our treatments are out of pocket and not covered by insurance.  We are dealing with primary infertility.

I am the female and am 33.  My husband is 36.  We had been trying for over 2 years before seeking input from RE and urologist.  My husband was born with hypospadias, which he had surgery for as a toddler.  He has seen a urologist to fix the prior surgery, but the specialist does not believe it will yield better sperm.  The procedure would cost of $8k out of pocket due to deductibles.  Due to this, we opted to address his surgery after we do IVF.   
 He states that in his early 20s, he is aware of two girlfriends that got pregnant with him.  I have never been pregnant (that I know of).

In April 2019, when 32, I had an AMH of 1.92, FSH of 8.85 and 8 antral follicles.  I also have hypothyroidism (likely Hashimotos).

In June 2019, we started a microdose flare protocol cycle.  I was on microdose Lupron for approximately 11 days.  On day three of the microdose, we started Gonal F 400 and Menopur 2 powders.  After four days of that, I had an ultrasound that showed I was overresponding and my follicles were different sizes (side note: I took the ""overresponding"" comment as a positive.  In hindsight I know it is not).  My follicles ranged from 6mm to 21mm.  At this point I had 15 follicles and my estradiol was 1164.  They lowered by Gonal F to 300 and instructed me to take 2 Menopurs that evening, then drop it to one the following evening.  I was then told to come back in for labs and scans on Day 7 instead of Day 8.  At this scan I had 15 follicles ranging from 4mm to 30mm.  They lowered my Gonal F to 250 and kept me at 1 Menopur, then instructed me to lower Gonal F on Day 8 to 225, then down to 200 on Day 9.  My estradiol on Day 7 was 1974.  On Day 10, I had 17 follicles ranging from 10mm to 39mm.  My estradiol was 5862.  We took no stims that night and triggered with one ovidrel.  On Day 12, we did our egg retrieval, which resulted in 13 eggs, 6 mature, 3 fertilized, and 1 Day 6 frozen BC embyro.

After discussing with the Doctor, he wanted to try a different protocol for our second banking embryo cycle.  He believed I need to be suppressed longer and to add a growth hormone to maybe help the quality of the eggs.

In late August 2019, we started our second retrieval cycle.  It was a long lupron with omnitrope protocol.  I did 10 days of full dose Lupron before starting stims.  On Day 1 of stims, we started with Gonal F 300, 1 Menopur, and Omnitrope .3.  Continuing that each night, I then had my Day 5 labs and ultrasound.  They counted 16 follicles ranging from 5mm to 15mm.  Overall, this seemed better than cycle one as the follicles were closer in size.  My estradiol was 596, also better than first cycle.  I went back on Day 7, and had 18 follicles between 6mm and 22mm, and my estradiol was 1357.  They then brought me back in for two more days.  Day 8 I had 19 follicles between 10mm and 23mm, then Day 9 I had 19 follicles between 10mm and 26mm.  Again, all of this seemed better than our first cycle.  We stopped stims on Day 8 and triggered a day earlier than planned.  We had our retrieval on Day 11, which which resulted in 17 eggs, 10 mature, 5 fertilized, and 1 Day 6 embryo (I don't know the grade yet).

What we have been told thus far is it is both a very poor egg quality and sperm morphology issue.  They are performing ICSI.  Does anyone know of a similar above situation and have insight on how to get better embryo results out of decent egg retrieval counts?  A protocol that worked for you or someone you know?  I'm also seeking input on what you would do next with the above results.  We could probably scrape together for one more full cost IVF cycle with a new doctor, but that terrifies me because if it doesn't work we would be out of money.  We could do another retrieval with the same doctor for less money, but I'm losing confidence given the above two resulting cycles.  We could just be grateful we have two embryos and transfer them.  We could PGS test ($6k which we already paid for, but could get back some of if we opt not to test) the two we have.

We are nearly three years into this struggle and I am so scared at the possibility of losing my remaining tube. We can’t afford IVF right now, and may not be able to for quite a few more years. Most of my friends and family don’t understand how fucking hard this has been or why I am scared. They all say, well there is always IVF. IVF is financially, physically, and emotionally draining (anyone going through or has gone through IVF - you are warriors). So, I’m scared. I am terrified by what tomorrow may bring. I scared of hearing the words, “we couldn’t save your tube”. Waking up after the emergency surgery to learn that I lost the tube and my other one wasn’t viable after losing the pregnancy ( I found out I was pregnant, it was ectopic, and it ruptured all in the same day) was horrific. I’ve never felt anguish like that before; I’m terrified of feeling it again. Has anyone else been through something similar?</p>

The last one was caused by trisomy 21. I don’t know what caused the other ones. I actually got pregnant 3 out of the 5 months we officially tried, it just didn’t stick. I signed up for my husband’s health insurance so I would have insurance for IVF. We are now getting divorced and I just turned 36. The insurance also provides coverage for egg freezing, and so I thought if I wanted a chance at having my own children, I would do two egg freezing cycles before we got divorced. I still have to pay for the meds out of pocket (which is very expensive) but the doctor stuff is all covered, which is the only reason the procedure is financially accessible to me at all. 

Well, I just finished my first cycle (21 days on BC before 11 days of 450 iu Follistim, 20 miniHCG daily, Ganerilix starting on day 5, an HCG trigger on day 11). 7 eggs were retrieved and only 2 were mature. I’m really disappointed. The doctor is saying that I should do another cycle with some changes (shorter time on BC, take Clomid during the first 5 days of cycle, otherwise the same meds) and I honestly don’t know if it’s worth it. The drugs cost $5000 and going through a divorce and the emotional rollercoaster of egg retrieval at the same time is really hard. But I would like chance to have own children someday and I would like to know that I’ve done everything I reasonably can do to have that. I would appreciate any and all perspectives, even if the advice is hard to hear. If the advice is “save your money to get a donor egg in a few years” I could accept that.

I’ve only just found the strength to post on here again so sorry for my absence and not replying to people.

Brief background- I’m 23 with PCOS. My partner has very slight MFI.

Our first IVF cycle was disastrous. 
I was put on 150 menopur for 3 days. This didn’t make my follicles grow at all. My dose was increase to 225 on day 4. Went back for a scan on day 6 and still minimal growth. I was then put on 300 of menopur (note, only menopur, no other drug added!) and literally 4 days later had my egg retrieval. I don’t know how or why the clinic thought this was a good idea. I’m no expert but my eggs clearly hadn’t been given enough time to mature. 

19 eggs were retrieved. We jumped for joy. 

5 eggs fertilised ‘normally’ - I wasn’t told how many of my eggs were matured and to be honest I’ve been too distraught to ask. 

Out of those 5 embryos, we only got 1 blastocyst. All of the others perished. It was a top grade blast and ended in a chemical.

I’m going to look at starting our second cycle in December time when I feel a little stronger. We have already prepaid for numerous cycles. 

My question is-
Is my next cycle likely to be as horrifically bad as my first? I can’t understand why we only managed to get 1 blastocyst when I’m 23 and in relatively good health. The only infertility issue I’ve got is PCOS. Everyone told me PCOS ladies tend to respond amazingly to IVF, especially young ones. I definitely did not respond well and my cycle was very nearly cancelled due to me not responding (I wish they had just cancelled it now and saved one of our three prepaid cycles!)
It has lead me to believe we will need to use egg donors due to how poorly I did in my first cycle. Egg donation isn’t an option for me, unfortunately and is not something I’d want to pursue.

I understand I’m jumping the gun here, but it’s been a horrible few months for me and I’ve only just gotten out of a mental health hospital as I admitted myself due to feeling very low over this. I’ve also had an evil kidney infection that my doctor thinks was brought on by stress as for the past 2 weeks I’ve been unable to eat or drink properly. So I was hospitalised for that too. Isn’t infertility a fun journey?

Any advice is welcome. Is there anything I should put across to my RE? I hope he tweaks my next protocol and makes it a better one. I’m unsure whether it was the poor protocol that lead us to a failed cycle, or just my useless body and eggs. I’ve browsed the hunger games posts and numerous other threads and very few people have only ended up with one blastocyst from their cycles. It’s making me feel as though I’m some kind of freak :-( I have relatives who have done IVF and they all had at least 2-3 left over to freeze.

Hi everyone! It's been a few months since I last posted. I temporarily made it over to the grads sub, on my 4th transfer, before everything came crashing down at 14 weeks. Still not ready to talk about that. 

I was fortunate to have 4 embryos on ice when I miscarried in June, and last week I transferred two of them - unsuccessfully.

My question is: since the hycosy is carried out before ovulation, is it possible to have the FET in the same cycle? I should mention that my last FET, and this one, are unmedicated until trigger. I react terribly to estrogen.

After much research I picked an RE and my partner and I went to have tests run. His came back normal. Mine (age 35) were mostly normal, no blocked tubes, ovaries looked fine, and a pelvic MRI confirmed I actually did not have a uterine septum, there was a slight curve and no endometrial mass was seen. It also confirmed I had 3 fibroids between 1 - 1.6 cm dimension. There were 2 test that revealed some concerning information; my AMH level (0.93ng/ml) and FSH level (9.3 mlU/mL).  

My RE recommended I undergo a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy; I also have heavy cycles that last 7-8 days. She indicated given those low levels, I would need to move quickly if pregnancy was still a goal. She recommended I complete those procedures and immediately start the IVF process. I asked if these procedures would increase my odds of getting pregnant without IVF, she said they could but due to my low count and poor egg quality, I should move forward with IVF after the procedures. 

This was pretty surprising to hear, so I think I spent the rest of the appointment trying to digest the information while my partner asked questions and I tried to remember my questions. 

Here's what leads me to writing this post. I scheduled my appointment and received my pre-op instructions. In those documents it indicates the procedures  are a laparoscopy, possible ablation of endometriosis, hysteroscopy, polypectomy,  D&C.  

In researching endometrial ablations, I came across some information that said endometrial ablations are not recommended for someone that will want to get pregnant. Now I am concerned and unsure what to do to to ensure I am taking the right treatment path. I was going to contact another RE for a second opinion. I've been combing information online but not knowing if I am going down the right path is getting to be a bit overwhelming again.

78,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I’m kind of going through an IVF financing mini crisis. We have our first nurse consult for the cycle next Thursday, and we are supposed to make the big down payment that day. My insurance will only cover a percentage of monitoring and meds, while IVF procedures are considered out of network and so payed for entirely OOP. 

At the suggestion of many here, last week I applied for a 0% APR credit card. My plan was to use it mainly for meds, PGS/cryo, acupuncture, and other misc. things as they come up, and then take out a loan for the main IVF payment after I knew what the limit would be on the card. 

My clinic uses LendingClub, so the other night I was lounging on my couch and just perusing their website to compare their rates to other personal loan offers on creditkarma.

Without turning this into some kind of humble brag, I’d just like to preface this by saying I have excellent credit. My score is in the high 700s, my report is squeaky clean, I check up on it regularly with all 3 credit bureaus so I know there’s no issues with fraud or whatever. I’ve always thought the payback for all my financial diligence over the years was that I could easily borrow money if and when I really needed to. Like now.

So I fill out LendingClub’s little “check your rates” form that does just a soft pull on your credit report, and within a few seconds of hitting submit I get an email saying my application was denied. I’m dumbfounded. It says, “we’re sorry but we cannot approve your application at this time, you will get a letter in the mail within 30 days explaining our decision.  You can have another person apply in your behalf using their credit information.” The fuck?? First of all I didn’t realize I was actually applying for anything. I thought for sure this was a mistake or a glitch.

The next day I called and the rep I spoke to did not have access to the details of why I was denied, but told me I just have to wait for the letter to arrive within 30 days. Her manager told me the same. Unfucking believable. There is apparently no live person that I can speak with who can tell me why I was flat out denied.

All I can think of is, did I screw myself by applying for a new credit card just one week before trying to check my rates with LendingClub? Is it flat out denial-worthy to have a hard inquiry on my report that recently? The other thing is I just got the card in the mail and I haven’t activated it yet, so maybe seeing a hard inquiry without a new credit line showing up yet looks fishy? But obviously they use some kind of algorithm to approve it cause I got the denial message in less than a minute.

I’m just kind of paralyzed in indecision about what to do now. I’m scared that wherever I go next for financing might deny me, after another hard inquiry which would be worse.

I’m wondering if I should:

1. Active my new card and then ask for a higher credit limit (thinking that won’t happen)

2. Apply for another 0% credit card and hopefully between the two I can cover everything. (How many cards are people using who are going this route? Are you getting them all at once or waiting a few months in between?)

3. Go to my credit union and try to get either a personal loan or line of credit. There I can at least sit down with someone and explain everything. Might do this tmrw morning.

4. Cancel my nurse consult and wait til next cycle to get all of this sorted (really don’t want to have to do this). I did call to ask if I could push it out another week, and they said to keep the appt but they are ok with me paying up later, as long as it’s by the time of my baseline. 

5. Ask my parents to help me with the payment (really don’t want to have to go this route either. I’m planning on telling them pretty soon for the very first time that we’ve even been TTC, all that’s happened along the way and that we’re starting IVF... I really didn’t want all that to also include an ASK...maybe for round 2 or 3!) 

6. Liquidate my savings.

We have our first nurse consult for the cycle next Thursday, and we are supposed to make the big down payment that day. My insurance will only cover a percentage of monitoring and meds, while IVF procedures are considered out of network and so payed for entirely OOP. </p>

<p>At the suggestion of many here, last week I applied for a 0% APR credit card. My plan was to use it mainly for meds, PGS/cryo, acupuncture, and other misc. things as they come up, and then take out a loan for the main IVF payment after I knew what the limit would be on the card. </p>

<p>My clinic uses LendingClub, so the other night I was lounging on my couch and just perusing their website to compare their rates to other personal loan offers on creditkarma.</p>

<p>Without turning this into some kind of humble brag, I’d just like to preface this by saying I have excellent credit. My score is in the high 700s, my report is squeaky clean, I check up on it regularly with all 3 credit bureaus so I know there’s no issues with fraud or whatever. I’ve always thought the payback for all my financial diligence over the years was that I could easily borrow money if and when I really needed to. Like now.</p>

<p>So I fill out LendingClub’s little “check your rates” form that does just a soft pull on your credit report, and within a few seconds of hitting submit I get an email saying my application was denied. I’m dumbfounded. It says, “we’re sorry but we cannot approve your application at this time, you will get a letter in the mail within 30 days explaining our decision.  You can have another person apply in your behalf using their credit information.” The fuck?? First of all I didn’t realize I was actually applying for anything. I thought for sure this was a mistake or a glitch.</p>

Just trying to see what people going through similar journeys would do if y’all were in my shoes:

Our summary is that we’ve been trying for almost 4 years, 3 failed IUIs, and have never gotten pregnant. Husband has low morphology and high DNA frag, I have elevated NK cells. These tests were from almost 2 years ago. Since then, we’ve been on hold for treatments because we’re 100% paying out of pocket and I’m not ready for something as invasive as IVF (2nd opinion put that as our next step). Husband is working with a urologist now and it’s another waiting game. 

With period pains, I suspect endo. We both weren’t really wanting for me to go through a lap, but the more I read about it, the more it seems like endo is a big possibility. 

Is it worth it to go back for another consultation (which we paid ~$300 for speaking to either RE)? Did your OBs do your laps? Is a lap worth going through? 

There’s just so many unknowns and so little answers that we have right now! 😔

To answer /u/ModusOperandiAlpha, 
-	I don’t have the paperwork for my recent lab work nor do I remember numbers. :( All was normal except lower Vit D which I now take daily supplements for. 
-	I did a Sono and both tubes were open. 
-	With my elevated NK cells and husband’s high DNA frag, the 1st RE suggested a 7 day ejaculation regimen and steroids for me that cycle if we were to try IUI again. 2nd RE didn’t take this diagnosis into account and suggested IVF with ICSI. 
-	I haven’t heard of the ReceptivaDx biopsy test until today when I chanced upon the endo thread. Definitely something I wanna look into!
-	Yes, reproductive urologist ruled out varicocele very quickly from an exam. 
-	Actual diagnosis is pretty much Unexplained.

I just turned 34; my husband is 44. We have been trying for 9 months which I recognize is just a drop in the bucket compared to many couples. But I’m just so tired and everything is just so hard and I feel like I can’t stand it anymore. Due to our ages and some existing medication issues (both take antidepressants; I take meds for unexplained high prolactin;my husband takes testosterone and Clomid to offset the impact of the testosterone on his sperm) we started working with doctors pretty early as a precaution. I wasn’t ovulating regularly so my OBGYN referred us to a fertility specialist after just 3 months. We did 3 months of Clomid & timed intercourse; and have had one failed IUI. Dr prescribed a higher dose of Clomid for this cycle to try & stimulate more eggs (I only had 1 for our first IUI). I went for my ultrasound yesterday to check follicle growth to schedule another IUI round for this cycle only to find out that there were no follicles.  At all. Either I ovulated super early and the egg had already released or the higher Clomid dose had the opposite effect in me and I didn’t produce any eggs. But regardless of the reason why here we are with yet another month of no progress. We didn’t even get to TRY this month. I’m so over it. I’m so angry. Like deep, screaming rage angry. I completely melted down yesterday...multiple times. And this morning I don’t even want to get off my couch. I know I’m depressed. I was depressed before we even started this - that’s why I take fucking antidepressants. My husband keeps assuring me we well keep trying and everything will be okay and that I need to calm down because all the stress and cortisol could be hurting our chances (he says it more comforting than that but that’s the message - if I don’t calm down it’s only hurting our chances more). But how in the  holy fuck am I supposed to calm down when every day it feels like I’m getting further & further away from any hope of success? I can’t “just relax.” I’m too angry! I have no idea what to do with this rage I feel at everyone and everything. I’m doing everything you’re supposed to do already. I talk to a therapist. I take antidepressants. I exercise. I take walks in nature. I talk to friends about how I’m feeling. None of it makes me feel any better. Nothing makes me feel better. We’re getting older every day, every month and nothing can stop that. I’m worried about how we’re going to afford IVF if that’s the route I’m almost positive we’ll have to go. I’m worried that my husband’s sperm is the issue (he’s getting a retest semen analysis this month due to a borderline result last test). I’m worried about having to manage his emotions and feelings and depression if his sperm turns out to be the main roadblock and keep on managing my own.

100,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi friends! I used to be pretty active, but have taken a Reddit break for the past few months while doing IVF. We went into treatment knowing I was DOR (age 35, AMH .7, FSH 12-14, AFC 7-8) and it would probably take a few cycles, but things have gone so much worse than anyone anticipated. Here's my quick and dirty history: 

Dec 2017: IUD out

August 2018: CD3 tests and follow ups confirm DOR and mild MFI (1% morphology), plan to start IVF after the 1 year mark.  Add DHEA, CoQ10, DHA, Vitamin D supplements.

January 2019: natural conception while estrace priming (EP) for IVF #1. Blighted ovum.

March 2019: ANOTHER natural conception immediately after HCG = 0. CP.

May 2019: Finally IVF cycle 1. EP, HGH, 300 IU Gonal-F, 150 IU Menopur, start surging through the Cetrotide, so retrieval is moved up a day. Triggered on day 9 with Ovidrel. 5 eggs retrieved, 4 mature and fertilized,  3 excellent grade day 3's, 2 morulas on day 5, nothing by day 7.  Planned to do PGT-A due to previous MC history.

June 2019: Cycle 2. EP, Lupron flare with HGH and dexamethasone. Only one follicle developed so that was converted to an IUI. Triggered on day 10 with Ovidrel again.

August 2019: Cycle 3. EP, letrozole and 225 units of Gonal-F, 3 eggs retrieved and fertilized, 2 excellent grades transferred on day 3, last one arrested on day 4.  Started surging through the Cetrotide again, so triggered with HCG 10,000 on day 8.

After this cycle, RE says our odds with more IVF are under 10% and IUIs are 6-8% per cycle, so advised switching to FSH IUIs going forward.

September 2019: IUI with 225 units Gonal-F. What they thought was a collapsing cyst left over from the IVF cycle was actually a 16 mm follicle at baseline (CD 2). CD 7 my LH was over 60, so we rushed and did an IUI. In the TWW, but you know, not holding my breath. 

I have a second opinion consult at Shady Grove (Dr. Widra) in October. Mostly I want to get confirmation that we've tried everything we can try and there's no magic solution to my crap response and apparently hideous egg quality (besides DE of course). My current RE said she strongly advises against DNA frag tests and additional RPL testing because it seems pretty clear my egg quality is the cause of our issues and she doesn't want to go down a rabbit hole if it's not indicated. 

What am I forgetting about? Anything worth trying or asking about? I don't have it in me to do a bunch of embryo banking cycles, but would do probably one more retrieval if there was some missing piece of the puzzle that could give me a fighting chance again.

#How progesterone is “supposed” to work in the ovaries/uterus:

Good overviews here:  https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/progesterone/

**Where does the progesterone come from?  How is it generated within the body?**

Human eggs lay dormant and tiny inside follicles within ovaries until they are prompted by FSH to grow larger/ develop, and then are triggered by LH to undergo Meiosis II and ovulate by erupting/ bursting out of the follicle.  Sometimes this hurts a bit (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mittelschmerz/symptoms-causes/syc-20375122).  

If all goes well, the resulting burst follicle forms/morphs into what’s called a “corpus luteum”, and begins to generate progesterone (also estrogen, but progesterone is the focus of this post).  https://www.britannica.com/science/corpus-luteum

If there is no ovulation (for example, in women with anovulatory PCOS; or in a medicated FET cycle where the first step is suppression with oral BCP, Lupron, etc.), then as far as I can tell the female body pretty much won’t make any of its own progesterone.  

If the corpus luteum doesn’t generate much/ enough progesterone, this can lead to hormonal imbalances like “estrogen dominance” which can cause heavy/ long/ painful periods, among other things. Fun times! (Menorrhagia:  https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352829  , https://www.cemcor.ubc.ca/resources/healthcare-providers-managing-menorrhagia-without-surgery)

How long the corpus luteum continues to generate progesterone after ovulation, determines how long your luteal phase lasts.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4436586/#!po=61.4583)

If you don’t become pregnant, eventually the corpus luteum will run out of steam/ degenerate, and stop making progesterone, which means that there isn’t enough progesterone to maintain the uterine lining, and that prompts menstruation (some further discussion below).

Or, if you do become pregnant, the resulting HCG temporarily allows the corpus luteum to continue generating progesterone; and if things go well, at around 7-9 weeks eventually the placenta will become developed enough to take over the task of generating progesterone to support the ongoing pregnancy. 

**What does progesterone do?**

When the cells in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) are exposed to progesterone, progesterone causes these uterine cells to become receptive to / help enable the implantation of a potential embryo in roughly the blastocyst stage. Progesterone does this by triggering the cells of the endometrium to change chemically and morphologically -  prompts necessary glands to grow on the surface of the endometrium, etc. This process is called decidualization.  More on decidialization here:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidualization , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3443857/

I have not been able to find any research that quantifies how much progesterone the uterine lining cells must be exposed to in order to successfully undergo the decidualization change.  [[[ *If anybody knows of any such research, please share.* ]]]  All I have been able to find is that “some” progesterone exposure is necessary and sufficient to prompt those changes. 

Without progesterone, there’s no decidualization, and without decidualization there can be no embryo implantation - no matter how thick your uterine lining might be.  This is why, for example, “natural”/ unmedicated FETs must confirm the date/timing of the patient’s ovulation (and therefore the timing of the creation of the corpus luteum and the timing of the start of biological/ “endogenous” progesterone production), so that the transfer date and time can be accurately scheduled roughly 120 hours later; why some mostly unmedicated FETs use trigger shots to control the timing of the patient’s ovulation (and therefore the timing of the creation of the corpus luteum and the timing of the start of biological/ “endogenous” progesterone production), so as to be able to accurately schedule the transfer for approximately 120 hours thereafter; and why fully medicated FET cycles are so specific about when to start exogenous progesterone supplementation (e.g., 120 hours-ish before the scheduled transfer).  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653859/#__ffn_sectitle)   *Discussion of the synchronization of the completion of the decidualization process (“implantation window”) with the blastocyst’s or cleavage-stage embryo’s embryonic development, the hatching and implantation of embryos, etc. are already discussed elsewhere in the wiki of this subreddit under headings/links regarding transfers - SPECIFICALLY, “How a FET works”.*

**Progesterone is the maintenance crew of the decidualized lining of the uterus.** In the absence of *sufficient* progesterone, the uterine lining begins to break down, and eventually slough off through the cervix.  This can happen, for example, when a woman doesn’t become pregnant in a particular cycle (the corpus luteum stops making progesterone at the end of the regular luteal phase, which eventually results in menstruation); or in chemical pregnancies or early miscarriages (stalling/ falling HCG means less fuel for the corpus luteum, therefore disintegration of the uterine lining, bleeding and potential passing of miscarriage  tissues - uterine lining, embryo/fetus, and other “products of conception”). 

**How is supplemental progesterone usually delivered for a FET?**

This is discussed at length elsewhere in this subReddit, but generally speaking there are three modes of delivering supplemental progesterone:

Orally (from what I can tell, this is not commonly used);

By injection (e.g., progesterone in oil / PIO); and 

By topical/interior application (e.g., gels or creams applied into the vagina; or suppositories inserted vaginally or anally).

[Edit: If you *really* want a deep dive into the details of how progesterone administration via different routes is processed by the body, check this out: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics_of_progesterone ]

There has been a fair amount of research on what methods of delivery and dosages of progesterone have the best pregnancy outcomes and are best tolerated by women IVF patients. 

Relatively recent research out of the Shady Grove clinics found that daily PIO *or* daily vaginal suppositories plus PIO every 3 days, worked equally well; but vaginal suppositories on their own - I.e., without PIO - worked significantly less well. (https://www.shadygrovefertility.com/blog/treatments-and-success/asrm-2017-new-progesterone-study/) [Edit: here’s the link to the actual research paper:  https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)32047-2/abstract)

However, every body is different, and your mileage may vary - you may respond better to PIO, you may hate needles; you may respond better to vaginal suppositories but hate the “crotch spackle.”  As always, advocate for yourself and ask questions. 

**How is the presence and amount of progesterone in the body usually measured?**

Progesterone is usually measured in one of two types of units (ng/ml or nmol/L). Here’s a handy conversion tool: http://www.endmemo.com/medical/unitconvert/Progesterone.php

Progesterone can be measured with a blood test: this is referred to as the level of “serum progesterone.” (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=167&amp;amp;ContentID=progesterone) 

That’s fine and dandy, but there are a few challenges with that.  First, not all labs run progesterone tests in the same way - there are several assays/ methods of testing serum progesterone, so there can be variation in results.  

Second, research has shown that the amount of progesterone in the blood (serum progesterone) is not necessarily reflective of the amount of progesterone in/around the uterine lining (which is where we want it to be for fertility purposes). This is especially so when test subjects (e.g., women who are human beings undergoing frozen embryo transfer) are receiving progesterone supplementation by vaginal delivery such as progesterone suppositories. (http://hormonebalance.org/images/documents/Tavaniotou%2000%20Vag%20prog%20sup%20to%20oral%20LPS%20HR.pdf)  

Whereas progesterone supplementation that’s delivered by injection (PIO) has to circulate through the body’s other tissues/ vessels before it reaches its goal in the uterus; apparently progesterone supplementation that’s delivered vaginally causes some of the progesterone to be absorbed almost directly into the uterine lining via osmosis or some similar mechanism (vagina/cervix &amp;gt; uterus) without circulating through the body in the bloodstream.  (*Ibid.*) My RE called this “blasting” the uterus with vaginal progesterone... thanks for the visual buddy.

Moral of the story:  If you’re receiving progesterone supplementation vaginally only, or vaginally in addition to injection (PIO), the amount of progesterone actually reaching your uterine lining may be *more* than the amount of progesterone reflected in your serum progesterone blood test.  How much more? Who the heck knows? That’s an area for future research. 

The amount of progesterone present in the uterine lining could also technically be tested histologically, by uterine biopsy.  But that’s way expensive, invasive, painful (ouch!!!), and as a practical matter it’s not realistic to do a uterine biopsy in the same cycle as an embryo transfer. 

**How much progesterone is “sufficient” to maintain the lining of the uterus: for example, how much progesterone is enough to sustain the lining of the uterus during pregnancy until the placenta takes over?  How much progesterone is enough on the day of frozen embryo transfer?**

As noted above, in the absence of *sufficient* progesterone, the uterine lining begins to break down, and eventually slough off through the cervix. 

Also as noted above, measuring how much progesterone is actually present at/ near the lining of the uterus (where it needs to be for our fertility purposes) is difficult. 

As you might imagine, these factors make it difficult to study how much uterine progesterone is “sufficient” to maintain a pregnancy in women in general, and in a specific patient in particular. Keeping that in mind...

In a 2018 study of 161 patients undergoing FET and using *only vaginal progesterone*, the range of serum progesterone on the day of transfer in the study population was between 12.65-35.78 ng/ml (by my calculation using simple addition/ subtraction, this is the widest range of standard deviations reported), and the researchers found that “there was no association between serum progesterone level on the day of transfer and pregnancy occurrence”. (http://eprints.lums.ac.ir/1417/)  

Conversely, in  a 2018 study involving FET of 244 PGS/PGT-A normal embryos, using *only vaginal progesterone*, the researchers concluded that “A low serum P level (≤ 10.64 ng/ml) one day before FET is associated with a lower pregnancy and LBR following FET of euploid embryos”, and patients whose serum progesterone was ≤ 8.06 ng/ml one day before transfer “had a significantly higher miscarriage rate and significantly lower live birth rate” than those with  serum values above 10.64 ng/ml. (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09513590.2018.1534952)

In a 2015 study of 213  women transferring single PGS/PGT-A normal embryos, and using *only intramuscular progesterone* supplementation, it was determined that the highest ongoing pregnancy rate (70%) and lowest pregnancy loss rate (7%) were found in women whose serum progesterone on the day of embryo transfer was between 10–15 ng/ml. Serum progesterone of above 40 ng/ml was associated with the lowest ongoing pregnancy rate (33%), and so on: 15-20 ng/ml (62%),  20-30 ng/ml (52%), 30-40 ng/ml (50%). (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4595397/)

In a large (n= 4582 women) 2017 retrospective study, researchers found that “Increased live birth rates for frozen embryo transfer with hormone replacement therapy were seen with day 16 serum progesterone concentrations > 50 nmol/L (26.4% vs 11.3% for &amp;lt;50 nmol/L).”  Presumably “day 16” refers to the day before transfer or day of transfer.  Note that 50 nmol/L = 15.7 ng/ml. Pregnancy loss rates for the group with serum progesterone greater than 15.7 ng/ml (&amp;gt;50 nmol/L) were roughly half the rate of the pregnancy loss rates of folks with lower serum progesterone than that.  The full text article is behind a pay wall, and it’s unclear what type of progesterone supplementation was used for this study. (https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajo.12757)

Note that 50 nmol/L = 15.7 ng/ml. Pregnancy loss rates for the group with serum progesterone greater than 15.7 ng/ml (&amp;gt;50 nmol/L) were roughly half the rate of the pregnancy loss rates of folks with lower serum progesterone than that.  The full text article is behind a pay wall, and it’s unclear what type of progesterone supplementation was used for this study.

The deets:

I'm 37, my husband and I have been married 18 months now & trying to conceive with no success. I'm not super surprised by this--I've had a history of large cysts and have had 2 laparoscopic surgeries to remove them, and now only have one ovary left. Ok.

We just recently met with a fertility Dr. and he ordered some tests for me. Regular levels on everything EXCEPT:

FSH is 17.7 mIU/mL (which is elevated I guess, but after internet research, some women have it way higher than that)

Egg Supply Score (ESS) is 1.

On Friday we had a follow up consultation, where he basically told us to give up, we have a less than 1% chance of getting pregnant so it wasn't going to happen. He encouraged us to use an egg donor. I found myself feeling brushed off, after all it's only been one blood test. I mean, give us a chance, man. He grudgingly agreed to let us do fertility pills + injection because I pushed, but he was skeptical about the whole thing. He said it would only raise our chances to 1.5%.

What do you guys think? We are just beginning the infertility journey so I have a lot to learn, but my gut is telling me he's not giving us a fair shake. I know a lot of people in this group have done a lot of research and can give me their opinion. (I've gone down the internet conspiracy rabbit hole (hurr hurr) where they say fertility Drs push you to do an egg donor because it gives their clinics a higher success rate. I do feel like he jumped to that solution awfully quick, TBH.)

To complicate matters, when they tested me, they did a vaginal ultrasound and found 3 large cysts. (4-6 centimeters each or something.) They are not causing me much pain so I'm not going to worry about them right now, but I sense that like before, they will need surgery eventually to be removed. The fertility Dr. said that would cause even more trauma to the ovarian tissue and make my chances even worse. So I'm just going to let them lie for now. (I'm aware that ovarian-stimulating pills and injections will make them larger.)

Hi everyone I’ve been in here for a while but desperate for some help. Im an American that lives in Germany and I’m having a very hard time navigating the infertility world here. I’ve had multiple surgeries for ovarian cysts both here and in the states. I’ve never been pregnant and my husband and I are currently trying unsuccessfully. It was suggested we have start seeing an infertility doctor. Unfortunately, due to being lost in translation a lot of things aren’t communicated to me and I am mostly in the dark. No one understands me so please help. 

Two years ago I began four rounds of a German hormone named Esmeya to shrink my cysts and then had a c-section to remove them. After that ordeal I was told to wait to try to get pregnant for a full year. However, I didn’t get my period after and when I finally got one period which was like a biblical flood they asked me to try four months early. Of course after the flood and one fascinatingly normal period later everything stopped again. Then I was told trying was futile because as it turns out my tubes decided to become blocked. So they sent us to multiple fertility clinics to ask questions I didn’t know to ask. The reception was rude as this is Germany and after multiple attempts at getting into a clinic we found one willing to start the IVF process considering my uterus is beautiful now, I’m 38 and he’s 45. We have been going there for over six months with them putting me on a shitton of drugs to start the real drugs to begin the hormonal process of stimming. They asked me to beef up my vitamin D, folic acid and iodine. They asked that I lose weight. They put me on a thyroid pill. They asked that I keep losing weight while waiting for a period. 

Well I got a period and the problem is IT WILL NOT STOP!!!! Now my husband and I are still being encouraged to try but this is putting a damper on the natural AND assisted process. They can’t start the hormones until I’m regulated and I can’t continue bleeding out of my eyes. At this point not them or me can see a normal cycle to be monitored. I don’t know what day I’m on as I’m just miserable all the time. I’ve been like this for now 3 months and I was told my body is catching up?! Has anyone experienced this? Is there some way I can stop it or regulate it? Seriously how am I supposed to count days and track ovulation if all I do is bleed 24/7 going all summer. I would like to start stimming and be apart of this community (actually know wtf I’m talking about and be aware of goals leading to a pregnancy) but I feel hopeless and toxic after what I consider a pointless surgery and now over a year and no baby - please help?!

TLDR - I have had no cycle to monitor and start the IVF process as my period has been non stop for three months straight.

-35F, DOR
-PGD needed b/c husband and I are cystic fibrosis carriers.
-First retrieval gave us THREE PGS & PGD normals, two failed to implant, one was blighted ovum.
-ERA done after fails and results show I am late receptive
-Our second and last retrieval yielded only ONE pgs and pgd normal embryo. So that's it, this is our last chance.

After having 3 PGS normals fail last year, I pushed to have an RPL panel done, even though I didn't meet the testing criteria. Through this testing, it was discovered that I had a positive result for APS antibodies. This was back in June. I have since gone for a follow up appointment and lab work (they recommend to retest in 12 weeks), which again showed a high positive result for APS antibodies.

I just got back from an appointment with a hematologist, who suggests I don't have APS since I've never had a blood clot or miscarriage over 10 weeks. He suggested that I likely don't have APS because with all the hormone injections and treatments I've undergone the last couple of years, I would have likely had a experienced a blood clot.

Are my lab results something we should just ignore? I meet lab criteria for APS but not clinical.

I'm scared to ignore these findings, especially since we only have one precious embryo left to work with... do we move forward with the FET as normal or try and suggest to my doc that we change my protocol or add blood thinner? All 3 previous protocols I was on BC pills for 3 weeks, then estrace for a few, then POI shots before FET.

Should I push to repeat the ERA if we change the protocol?

However, our PGS testing results are still not back (they were sent out last Monday so it’s been almost 2 weeks now) so the clinic told me we needed to reschedule. The RE is out of town the next two weeks and the next available appointment isn’t until October 4th. Delays are so stressful when it feels like my eggs are just disappearing and getting worse by the second. 

I ran into an old friend outside of work today who I immaturely and selfishly ghosted a couple years ago. She was so kind and asked how I was doing and my response was to start bawling uncontrollably. Poor thing was saying “is it me? Are you crying because of me?” I told her no but holy fuck did I look unhinges in that moment. She just had a baby as a 40year old single woman - I shouldn’t have bad feelings towards her because she really struggled too, but well, here we are. 

I’ve gained so much weight from hormones and depression - probably 25lbs since April. I feel so awful about myself and like I don’t even recognize who I see in the mirror - like I’m inhabiting a stranger’s body. Nothing fits. I feel like shit. 

Aside from the awkward crying spells I’m usually a cheery person, which has served as a good defense mechanism for not getting too vulnerable around others. The downside to this is nobody knows how fucking hard this all is. When they ask me, I always smile and say “it’s tough but I’m fine!” in way too cheerful of a voice. The truth is, I’m really not fine. This all just fucking sucks. 

I know I need to go to therapy. I want to go to therapy. But the thought of missing any more work for appointments, dealing with anymore medical bills or insurance claims, interacting with yet another new person, exhausts and terrifies me. The last time I brought up my infertility in therapy was when we were just in the diagnostic stage, and I told her how hard and overwhelming and depressing it all was. Her response was “well, I guess that’s just how parenting is.” I wouldn’t fucking know because I’m not a fucking parent...I didn’t realize it at the time but boy did her statement minimize my experience and make it sound like I just needed to stop whining. 

I feel so burnt out at work, just showing up is a struggle. But I can’t slow down or take more time to rest because we’re broke. IVF has drained our finances and if I don’t work, how do we continue with treatment? So I show up and barely get through my days. I work in child welfare and we receive a lot of training about burnout and secondary trauma, which are both so REAL to me right now. Despite this, I feel like I can’t (or...won’t?) do anything about it right now.

So basically in the “Not great, but not enough to be considered DOR.” I’ve just been referring to it as “below average for my age.” There’s nothing wrong with my Vitamin D levels. However this is surprising because women in my family go through menopause extremely late.

This is two questions, one of etiquette, in the first place, and the other how to respond as an infertile person, on the other.

The situation is that my younger brother's wife is about to have a baby in December. He and his wife bingoed me on Mother's Day with their pregnancy announcement while I was alone  living in another country I had just recently moved to while my husband stayed in the US (where my family is from) for work. It was one of the most emotionally bruising things I have gone through, for reasons which I love that I don't have to explain here. My best friend is also due at the same time. She and her partner had to do IVF and though their IVF experience was relatively easy, the kinship of having to struggle and the fact that it's my best friend makes me feel all warm and gooey about their about-to-be-kid. I feel like I will be warm and gooey about my brother's kid, at some point, but I am not feeling at all gooey towards him and his wife rn. It will be the first child born to any of us four siblings.

I am currently still abroad, but I've moved countries to one that is further away and more expensive to return home from. I am not sure, given my currently salary and work conditions, if it is a financially or professionally good decision to come home in December for the newborns, but I want to bracket those concerns for now.

The etiquette question: I am someone with limited social awareness (like when my husband and I were dating, for instance, he'd be like 'what's the proper way to dress for X family occasion' and I'd always get the answer slightly wrong). I can be in my head a little bit. Do people fly across the country to see their siblings' newborns? Do they fly across the ocean?

The infertile person question: Do I have to fly home in December to see the babies shortly after birth (when I feel like my emotions will be even more raw)? Or can I wait a month or two?

Hoping this can help others with their WTF convos if they find themselves in a similar situation.


**Diagnosis:** Husband \- MFI, 0% morphology, low to normal motility and count. Me - Had small likely endometrioma that went away during 2 week birth control suppression, organs still ""fluid"", no lap to officially diagnose. Low AMH (0.9 ng/mL) but normal FSH (2.5 mIU/mL) and antral follicle count of 19. RE considers my ovarian reserve to be within the expected range for my age (32ish).

**Protocol**: Antagonist (gonal F, menopur) + ICSI

**Outcomes and** ***next steps***:

* Low egg retrieval rate and number - 6 eggs from 14+ follicles in right size range. Maturity rate of eggs retrieved was normal - 5 mature of 6 retrieved
   * *Doc confirmed this is unexpected and potentially a trigger issue. Changed my trigger from Ovidrel to 10K HCG trigger for next cycle.* 
   * *Increasing stim doses (menopur is x3 previous cycle) as if fertilization rate is a % gamble, more = more chances. RE believes this may also help with overall maturity issue, assuming the follicles with no eggs were due to immaturity*
   * *Also skipping birth control surpression to try to increase total retrieval #*
* Low fertilization rate: 1 of 5 mature fertilized. 
   * *Embryologist report did not indicate that the mature eggs retrieved had any ""fragility"" issues (based on appearance at retrieval and description of ones not fertilized)*
   * *No obvious reason for this low of fertilization, it could be either sperm or egg or both*
   * *Switching from ICSI to PICSI to optimize for better sperm quality*
* 1 3 day embryo (7 cell, medium grade) transferred resulting in chemical pregnancy at 5.5 weeks. I had multiple days of bleeding including what seemed like ""full flow"" throughout the process. *RE confirmed growth of 3 day embryo was normal, which means normal growth is feasible for us. Also took CP as a relatively good sign as it gives more info to work with. Unfortunately pregnancy ended too early to be able to tell if implantation issue or embryo issue.*
* Progesterone - apparently was lower than expected at my last blood draw to test out my CP. *RE switching me to PIO which can help keep progesterone at appropriate levels. May also help with bleeding issue mentioned in previous bullet*

**Other notes**:

* Husband started taking FertilAid supplement around July, so hopefully we see some improvement in sperm health for next cycle
* I'm starting to take Co-Q10 again to see if that helps. I had tried before but it gave me bad GI issues. I just bought a new brand.
* I asked about regular fertilization followed by rescue ICSI but RE didn't think the ICSI procedure itself was contributing to low fertilization rate based on the egg reports
* I asked about switching to other protocols but RE thought increasing here may be better as a first step
* RE not concerned about endo as cyst was small and went away, and most endo treatments overlap with IVF treatments. RE only recommends follow up on endo in case of multiple large cysts


Hope my essay helps someone. No idea what impact these changes will have on my cycle in reality, but am slightly more hopeful again. Ideally would have more than 1 transfer chance per retrieval but it's all a gamble anyways, so who knows.

**Edit in case someone is reading this later:** From my 2nd ER cycle (after the changes mentioned above), we had 16 retrieved, 9 fertilized. I didn't get a breakdown of mature vs. non-mature, but of the 9 fertilized, 2 were just ""regular"" IVF with non-mature eggs. The 2 were somehow fertilized without ICSI but both did not make it to day 5. In total, we ended up with 4 blasts (I think 2 day 5, 2 day 6).

Yesterday, my husband and I talked more about ending treatment for good. I don’t share most of my thoughts, emotions, dreams, and fears with people I know. But lately I’ve been opening up more to my husband. It’s good for our marriage regardless of whether kids come along, and I’ve been more comfortable doing that in large part because of this process. So I mentioned that instead of working another 10 years and retiring early, I could instead pursue some not super-lucrative ideas sooner since we wouldn’t be as concerned with saving for things like college funds. He gave me a skeptical look and asked for specifics. They involved writing, and he picked up on that because he knows I love it and I’ve tried (albeit half heartedly) to pursue it without success. Indeed, one is an intensely personal project that other family members are only now starting to show interest in. 

Then he said, “The time for chasing dreams has passed.”

I’ve always loved writing. I’ve always been good at writing. I’ve always wanted to be some kind of writer. I studied journalism, I interned in publishing, I became a lawyer. During the worst of my depression, my cousin suggested I write out my thoughts because, as she said, you like to write and you’re a good writer. A federal magistrate judge once told one of my supervisors that I had given the best closing argument he’d ever heard. Maybe he said that to others as well, but I knew - I KNEW - that my greatest strength was telling the jury a compelling story and keeping their attention the whole time. I can’t do much else in life, but I can string together some words and add impressive alliteration. I’ve made so many excuses over the years for why I can’t be a writer, or why I can’t make the time or effort. 

My partner in life, the one person who is supposed to have my back, just shit all over the one big dream I had left. And when this guy shits, you notice. 

And he does this. He does this all the time. Admittedly, sometimes it’s for the better. I have a lot of wild, naive ideas, and he’s a hardened, pessimistic realist. But he’s also depressed. And in spite of all I’ve experienced - so many life setbacks and my own depression - I still have so many ideas because I’m not just wild and naive. I’m optimistic. I can’t help myself. I look at everyone else who’s happy, people who deserve it, people who don’t deserve it, and like Mindy Kaling, I ask myself: “Why not me?”

I was driving to work from my ERA baseline this morning, and I realized that 9/11 happened 18 years ago. That means that 18 years ago, I was a college freshman in New York, ambitious and excited to become a foreign correspondent or documentary filmmaker or profile writer. Over 18 years - an entire childhood’s worth of time - I’ve scribbled down scenes and poems, hoarded interesting facts and observations and newspaper articles to weave into plots, taken notes after I wake up from a weird dream to turn it into a story, and made up character names without knowing where they would end up. Those notes are in academic planners stuffed in a large plastic box, and saved in Word documents, and scattered in my Apple Notes. The story drafts are written in pencil in spiral notebooks, the writing in places smudged so much that I involuntarily squint to make out the text. They are typed on 20-year-old printer paper in Courier New font, from a Dell desktop I both loved and despised. They play out like movie or TV scenes in my head. They have soundtracks I burned onto CDs in college or created with Pandora. They’re the voices in my head. 

I wanted to be a parent. I wanted to have those magical holiday moments around the Christmas tree, those backyard summer dinners after picking homegrown vegetables, those first days of school, those music recitals, those soccer games, those trips to the library. And yet those things never pressed on me for so many years like the urge to be a writer. Throughout this process, I’ve consoled myself, kept myself from drowning in grief, by reminding myself that even without kids, I still have something to do. Something to pursue. Something to look forward to when I wake up in the morning. It’s not video games or a new YouTube video. It’s not the work I do in my cubicle. It’s not an annual trip to a Disney World. It’s not watering my plants. It’s not renovating the house. If I take this other path, I need something to move towards in the future so that I don’t Michael Corleone back into treatment and despair. 

I’m meeting with a younger lawyer tonight to mentor her, and my husband is excited about it. He reminded me to be the mentor I always wanted. What am I supposed to tell her after last night?

I may not have kids, so that leaves me free to chase other dreams. But if the time for chasing dreams has passed, what remains? What else is there?

We put ourselves through this because we’re not supposed to give up on our dreams. But we can’t have another dream? Or we can’t Lazarus an old dream? I thought anything was possible. He said we were a power couple. He said we would conquer the world. I guess he meant just a video game world. 

The more I think about it, the more I want to tell him and anyone else who shits on my wild hopes: Fuck you. Fuck your pessimism. Fuck your depression. Fuck your lack of dreams. I have been through too fucking much to roll over and die like an old banana that will never be banana bread. If you don’t want to come with me while I chase this sparkle-hearted unicorn fantasy, then I will drop you like a bag of dirt. It’s been 18 fucking years. Half my life so far. My dream is now an adult and old enough to vote and buy porn. If I fall on my ass, that’s on me. But it’s my ass, and I’m tired of stabbing it with giant needles.

<p>What I read about (got recommendations also) is antioxidiants, like ferulic acid, altho found more about the skincare applications... What do you supplement the men with? Amazon is full with booster pills, but I don&#39;t dare to just randomly order stuff. Our diet is more or less healthy to begin with, we are avoiding processed foods and eat our veggies.</p>

226,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Please stick with me here. This may be pretty long but I feel horrendous. 

If you’ve read my previous posts, you’ll know I had an early miscarriage and lost our only blastocyst in the process. No baby. None on ice. Nothing to show for all the money spent on meds and the work I put in to grow all the eggs I had. 

I did not mention this in my previous post, but after we announced to very close family that I’d had a positive pregnancy test, my sister in laws who are lesbians decided to go and get a frozen embryo transfer the exact same week I got the positive test. They already have a little girl who they struggle to cope with and constantly complain about. The moment I got those two pink lines, they shot down to their fertility clinic and decided to get another one of their many high quality blastocysts put back in. I am fully under the impression they did this on purpose. Their child is 5 years old. They’ve had 5 years to use another blastocyst but only decided to do it when we got pregnant? Long story short, she got a positive pregnancy test today from that transfer. I’ve never screamed as loudly in my life as I did when I received the text saying this. Never. I’m devastated. I can’t move from my bed. I think I’m going to die. 
Their baby is due in June if all goes well with the pregnancy. Our baby was due May. I don’t even want to meet their stupid fucking baby. I don’t want anything to do with it. But in 8-9 months time I’ll put on a brave face and pretend I care.

I keep watching miscarriage experience videos over and over again on YouTube just to remind myself that I’m not alone, but these women aren’t the same as me. Mostly anyway.
90% of them aren’t infertile and never have been. 90% of them already have kids and this was their second or third pregnancy, sometimes even fourth. At least they have something left to live for after their miscarriages. What do I have? I’ve got to start a second IVF cycle when I feel mentally ready to do so. I have nothing left. 

I feel horribly offensive saying the above, because any miscarriage is devastating but I almost feel I have more reason to cry and complain than a woman who already has four kids and has had a miscarriage and no infertility issues. She has reason to get her ass out of bed every morning. I have nothing left now. I don’t know if I’ll ever be a mom. 

My life feels over. I’ve cried all day. I think my sister in laws news has really made it hit home to me that yes, I’ve lost our baby and only blastocyst. I feel I have no right to complain though because I was only 4 weeks pregnant. 

I feel so alone. Even if I’m not alone I feel alone. I’m honestly considering checking myself into a mental hospital as I’m definitely at risk of harming myself. My sister in laws can go fuck themselves. They had this perfect idea in their stupid heads that we’d both carry our babies at the same time and the kids would grow up close in age and it’d all be picture perfect. Even if this pregnancy fails for them, they have 5 grade 1 blastocysts on ice. I’ve got nothing. I’ve got nothing left. What do I do and where do I turn? 

My husbands reaction has been enough for me to consider packing my bags and leaving for a few weeks or months. I wanted him to scream and be angry too at his sister for getting an embryo transfer to try and catch up with us, but he was casual about it and basically just said it was annoying and ‘wrong’ of them but there’s nothing he can do. Yes he’s right but I so want someone to feel as fucking angry as I do. 

His response to the miscarriage has been just as lacklustre. He told me that when we move on to our second prepaid cycle he’s hopeful we will have more embryos to freeze and bank so maybe it’s a blessing this cycle didn’t work. We’re part of a prepaid 3 cycle shared risk program that ends when you have a ‘live birth’ so if that baby had survived we wouldn’t have gotten any refund element or had any further cycles to use up. 

If human life is so hard to create and so delicate, why are there so many of us? And I keep asking myself how the world is carrying on, when mine is breaking apart. I keep asking myself how my husband can sleep so soundly next to me at night, whilst I lay awake crying and typing things like this out. I keep asking myself, how he can walk about as normally.

In a few weeks time, maybe a few months, this man will hold my hand again and stroke my hair as I writher in pain in the egg retrieval room all over again, the horribly dull, deep ache of having your eggs pulled out of you whilst you’re not sedated at all, and beg for more gas and air. He’ll cheer me on each time they pull an egg and our brief optimism may restart. I’ll come out of the operating room but I won’t be as hopeful as I was the first time that I came out. I won’t crack as many jokes to my husband or nurses. I won’t care when they tell me how many eggs they got this time. My heart may not even bang as hard when I see the clinic are calling me to tell me how many have fertilised, because I’ll never expect anything good from IVF ever again after this cycle. After the realisation of what IVF really is. 

Through all this, I’m partially grateful I got to see my first ever positive pregnancy test. Even if it wasn’t a true positive. Because for just a day or so I believed I was having the love of my life’s baby. I got to clutch the test in my hand and marvel over the faint faint line. I got to think to myself “maybe it’s worked. This is amazing. How are we so lucky?” For nearly 3 years, I’ve never owned a positive pregnancy test. I’ve never even seen one. I got chance to see one this time. It was there. Something was there, albeit not to be. 


My first cycle ended as quickly as it began. I don’t know how much more I could go through this. I thought I was depressed before my first IVF cycle, but now I know what depression really is. Pure desperation and an inability to even get out of bed. I want to be held like a crying toddler, but at the same time I want to be left alone to mourn in peace.

235,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello all, 
I have posted a few times here but mostly lurked. I have a question I think this group would  be especially equipped to give opinions about. 

I lost a fallopian tube and a pregnancy about a year and a half ago. I have had my last 4 cycles monitored via ultrasound, and each time it was on the tubeless left side. I've done some checking around, and it seems fairly common to have a ""boss"" ovary, which unfortunately seems to be the one with a very low likelihood of getting my egg to my uterus. (The chances are somewhere from 15-30%).

The only treatment that doesn't involve crossing our fingers and waiting a few more years seems to be stimming to force the lazy ovary to make an egg/eggs in addition to the boss ovary.

My question is this: if I'm already paying for the meds, sticking myself daily, and going in for monitoring every day, should I just have ivf? It is a lot more expensive, but we could manage (but I don't think I could manage those appointments month after month). I have heard from a lot of women on Reddit that the retrieval and transfers aren't too terrible and I've heard a lot of horror stories about the drugs. I had an ultrasound mid follicular stage in my cycle last month and had around 9 competing folicules, so my uneducated guess is I would make a decent number of mature eggs on stims. Would it be silly to ""waste"" the eggs on the tubeless side by not having them retrieved?

I’m starting to believe that maybe I’m just not meant to be a mother, and it’s damn depressing. I’ve gone through the fertility clinics, I’ve taken all the medication, and I’ve done the IUI... unfortunately IVF is $10,000 per try, and insurance refuses to cover it. I’ve lost the weight, I’ve gotten healthier, and yet still no baby.

I wasn’t sure where to post exactly, so please excuse the standalone. I promise not to make a habit of it. 

Tw: loss. 

We had a miscarriage a few weeks ago from our first FET, but second transfer (first was fresh).  The FET was actually two embryos transferred but per my betas, likely one took. For up to six weeks, then nada. I had two massive bleeds, after the first one, a scan showed a gestational sack and egg yolk— but a few days after the second bleed, we had nothing via scan. 

During that last terrible scan, our RE seemed onboard with doing RPL even though it was our first miscarriage, mostly because my age, I already know I have MTHFR mutations (the bad one, I always forget what it’s called) and I suspect I have endo. My RE, god love her, seemed open but as always, skeptical. We said we’d think it over and I’d email her— so I did, a few days later, and asked for a bevy of blood tests for thyroid, clotting things, prolactin, etc. 

She wrote back and totally changed her tune. She’s like: sorry I talked to everyone here and we are just doing another transfer, thanks bye. 

So I asked to speak to her and that’s happening tomorrow, so that’s happening in the afternoon. I’m disappointed but I do understand we’re more likely to have had a genetically abnormal embryo fail— sure— but peace of mind for testing for me matters. 

I’m curious what you all would recommend or what tack you might try in a conversation in a similar situation. Any similar scenarios out there? Thanks guys.

Last May, when my husband and I still thought he could have biological children, I underwent an egg retrieval. The retrieval was relatively successful (10 eggs) but afterwards I experienced a significant uptick in uterine pain and endometriosis-like symptoms that I hadn't experienced in almost 10 years (I had VERY bad periods in high school, but after getting on the pill in college, things seemed to even out and from 27 on I didn't use the pill and didn't need to.) 

This May, we did our first of 3 rounds of medicated (Letrozole) IUI. My first round, I noticed some weird changes, like a sense of bladder urgency and pressure, as well as mood/emotion changes. The second round I didn't see much of that at all, and round 3 it was all back.

We tried to go for round 4 but discovered I have ovulated before the day 12 ultrasound. My doctor recommended doing an unmedicated IUI next since the medicated one was causing side effects and I still only ever had 1 follicle.

We had planned on jumping back in at the next cycle, but THAT cycle started about a week early, which I attributed to the early ovulation. It put us at needing to do IUI stuff during a time we had to travel, so we put it off to this month.

Well now I'm 18 days into this cycle and it looks like my period is starting AGAIN. My periods have historically been pretty long (30-32 days) so 2 months in a row of these shorter cycles has me freaked out. I'm wondering if I'm going through perimenopause; I'm wondering if the egg retrieval/Letrozole kicked off perimenopause, I'm wondering if the hormones from the egg retrieval and IUI are mimicking perimenopause but isn't actually perimenopause....

Basically, I'm panicking that my previously somewhat stable fertility is about to go completely down the tubes in a matter of months and that I did something to cause it. Does anyone know any science around this? Can fertility treatments cause or mimic these kinds of symptoms?

I'm really scared. Any advice would be appreciated.

I discussed the supplements that I was taking along with any changes to our protocol that could increase our chances. I listed off all the supplements I was taking and my RE said, *if you really want to take anything, I would recommend probiotics.* I asked her why and she said there was really interesting emerging science on the benefits of certain bacterial flora in the uterus and vagina, in relation to pregnancy outcomes.

**Hold the bus.** In my several years of being on this site, I don't recall probiotics being discussed regularly. Therefore, research time.

Here is what I came up with:

* [Relationship of Vaginal Bacteria and Inflammation With Conception and Early Pregnancy Loss Following In-Vitro Fertilization](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/idog/2003/545298/abs/) - small study from 2002 showing a positive relationship between lactobacillus and pregnancy rates/live births.

* [Examination of bacterial contamination at the time of embryo transfer, and its impact on the IVF/pregnancy outcome](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-007-9146-5) - study from 2007 showing decreased pregnancy rates in women who test positive for certain bacteria.

* [Microorganisms within Human Follicular Fluid: Effects on IVF](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059062) - study from 2013. Tons of info but my take away was Lactobacilli was associated with positive pregnancy rates.

* [Does intravaginal probiotic supplementation increase the pregnancy rate in IVF–embryo transfer cycles?](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648310613016) - study from 2005. Long story short, the findings are that no, supplementation vaginally with a probiotic after retrieval does not increase positive pregnancy outcomes. This study doesn't look at supplementation prior to retrieval.

These 2 were brought up by another member in the last thread:

* [Evidence that the endometrial microbiota has an effect on implantation success or failure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937816307827)

* [Igenomix is also currently sponsoring a study assessing uterine microbiome and receptivity from fluid](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03330444?cond=Uterine+microbiome&rank=1)

So? Thoughts? Has your RE ever mentioned this? As per always, talk to your RE if you are thinking about starting anything new.

We had a horrible first IVF cycle. I got 19 eggs that lead to only one blastocyst. 

Of course, they put the blastocyst back in. 5 days later I got a very faint positive pregnancy test. I’ve never seen a positive test before so honestly I just shrugged it off and didn’t believe it. 

2 days later I took another. Much darker this time. Still shrugged it off as I didn’t believe we were lucky enough. 

1 day later. Took a clear blue digital. It popped up with “pregnant! 2-3 weeks” 

I called my clinic who advised me to test again in a few days. They don’t do Betas to confirm pregnancy. Only a home pregnancy test and then a scan at 6 weeks.

At some point I then began noticing my pregnancy tests lines were not progressing. I think all infertile women are guilty of taking multiple tests and that’s what I was doing. I was reassured constantly that it was because I was doing them at different times of day. I’m not stupid. My urine wasn’t diluted at all. The lines were fading. 

This morning I began bleeding. I was luckily seeing my psychologist at the clinic anyway so I told the clinic. They told me I have to wait 3-4 months to start my second round of IVF for my HCG to go to zero. I’m pretty sure it’s already headed to Zero, you morons (sorry, I’m just heartbroken) pretty sure it won’t take 4 months though!! I don’t get ‘cycles’ anyways. I don’t ovulate or have periods.

About 2 days ago I had also noted that my cervix was low and open. I’m pretty sure that ain’t what cervix’s do when pregnant. I was destined to lose that embryo. I also had no pregnancy symptoms. All the fertile myrtles on my Facebook newsfeed with pregnancy symptoms at 2 days pregnant. Not me 

My psychologist wasn’t overly comforting. Her response to all this was “well at least it proves you can get pregnant!! That’s amazing!” What?? It proves nothing of the sort 😂😂😂

<p>About 2 days ago I had also noted that my cervix was low and open. I’m pretty sure that ain’t what cervix’s do when pregnant. I was destined to lose that embryo. I also had no pregnancy symptoms. All the fertile myrtles on my Facebook newsfeed with pregnancy symptoms at 2 days pregnant. Not me </p>

<p>My psychologist wasn’t overly comforting. Her response to all this was “well at least it proves you can get pregnant!! That’s amazing!” What?? It proves nothing of the sort 😂😂😂 </p>

<p>So thats it. My first IVF cycle has ended as quickly as it started. I feel so done. I’m so depressed right now.</p>

I wanted to know if anyone here has done the Acrosome reaction test/ dye test. I'm an American who lives in Switzerland and here they seem to still do the test, and from my research many other places including the US, do not do this test anymore. Has anyone done it?

Does the test prove anything? OR is it pointless? Research seems to be split...especially since we are not in the IVF stage, which this test seems to be mostly used for. 

My husband has morphology at 2% and progressive motility at about 32% \_/concentration at about 48 mill/ total count at 113 mill. So they think the acrosome enzyme is missing, which leads to the sperm's tail to coil which hinders its swimming ability.

I dont know what to think. I feel like this process has been a test for our patience. We started fertility testing Sept of 2018. We are a year in and still no answers, no one wiling to give us any options, and so many receptionists do not call back (currently waiting for a phone call for hours). I am drained, especially since so much money has been put on these tests with nothing to show...so if anyone can give me research, thoughts, knowledge I would appreciate it.

For some background. Unexplained IF is our ""diagnosis"". SO sperm is amazing. All my labs are perfect, except slightly elevated testosterone. We are a year in on TI with follistim and trigger.
