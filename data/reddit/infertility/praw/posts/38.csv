In the last 6 months,  I did one frozen and two fresh IVF cycles,  and had two early miscarriages. I'm wrecked. My clinic is 2 hours away,  so provided a referral to my wonderful local obgyn for a d&c which I had three weeks ago and went perfectly. They've been calling me every three days ever since to check in,  but due to depression,  the hugest business disaster my workplace has ever experienced, life in general,  I haven't been able to take their call. 


I was also mad at them,  as this was my 3rd MC.  I had asked them for more testing after my second and they didn't agree,  and instead I had the worst fuckup of an Ivf cycle yet. This last cycle was better but their management of it was not ideal. My obgyn has now referred me to an excellent doctor locally to do RPL testing because my obgyn knew of some tests but not all,  and really felt the new RE would be the best one to see. 


So I had my 12 or so vials of blood taken Monday and have to wait a few weeks to get those back.  Yesterday I finally decided to call my clinic so they'd stop calling me and to see what they had to say and offer.  The first nurse who answers apologised for the MC,  then launched straight into asking if I had my second ultrasound a month ago,  what date, where, we NEED this information for our records.  I was already clearly upset, but she persisted. I tried to explain that they already have these records,  and they were copied onto my referral for d&c, how about you find them?  But she just couldn't understand and it was suddenly the most important thing in her world.  She went away,  talked to doctor,  and said doctor would call me back in half an hour. 

I get the call ffromthe doctor, explain I had a d&c and the doctor launches into an attack on obgyns saying they often don't realise that karyotyping can grow mother cells bot baby cells and because it was XX it could just be me that was nornal,  not the embryo. This is totally not the case with my very experienced obgyn who explained this possibility to me in a much calmer manner.  Then clinic starts on about a frozen cycle,  I mentioned to clinic doc that I am seeing someone here to have RPL testing done and am not willing to do any more transfers until I know more about why this keeps happening.  She sounds confused and talks down to me a bit,  and then says ""this is your first miscarriage"". Excuse me?  No. This is my third.  All three have been under the care of this clinic.  She's apologetic and says she's reading the page of my file from my first cycle, a year and a half ago,  instead of my current one.  More apologies. I'm still depressed at this point and give one word answers and wrap up the call as soon as I can. There was a whole lot of other nonsense that doesn't really adds to the story. I get off the phone and the fury sets in. 

I have two embryos frozen.  FET with this clinic is 1000 out of pocket after insurance rebates,  and they claim these rebates directly and only charge me the gap.  Monitoring is remote and infrequent. This pricing goes up significantly after June.

FET with the clinic my new doctor works at is 4600 upfront, I claim the rebates myself, and end up 2.5k out of pocket. 


Discussing with the husband,  and pending the results of our testing,  I'm considering doing a frozen cycle with the shit clinic for one cycle,  under the care of new doctor.  I'd follow her instructions and literally just go to shit clinic for transfer. I wouldn't give them the results of the cycle and then arrange with new clinic to transfer remaining embryo to them. I'm also considering getting both the embryos the fuck out of there and storing at new clinic.  Option 3 is to thaw and biopsy the two embryos,  sacrificing them for further info.  I'm not sure I could handle that if they were normal.  I have very stupid high AMH so this is a possibility I can consider in this situation that I would never do if I was a DOR lady. 

So what I'd really like to know, is have you transferred frozen embryos (or eggs,  sperm, genetic material) from a clinic you're firing to a new one? What was your experience?  Cost? (I'm in Aus but appreciate experience from all over the world).

<p>So what I&#39;d really like to know, is have you transferred frozen embryos (or eggs,  sperm, genetic material) from a clinic you&#39;re firing to a new one? What was your experience?  Cost? (I&#39;m in Aus but appreciate experience from all over the world). </p>

<p>Sorry if it&#39;s all rambly.  I&#39;m still full of rage at the world.</p>

I started [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5ub2e7/angry_at_feminism/?ref=share&ref_source=link) on here recently to talk about why I'm angry at feminism for not being there for me, and a lot of people had similar feelings -- just wanted to give a little update that made me happy. 

I recently joined the feminist committee of my political organizing group, and at our very first meeting we started planning a pro-choice fundraiser at a bowling alley. People were immediately calling it the Abortion Bowl-a-thon and joking about abortion-themed team names. On one hand, I get it, we need to be unapologetic about reproductive rights, and it's fun and often useful to be transgressive about taboos.

On the other hand, dead babies aren't hilarious to everyone, and we should be a little strategic about who we might be alienating, particularly people like me who already feel abandoned and shit on by feminism. 

I tried to make this point calmly without sharing my experience, but of course I ended up crying and making it clear that I was talking about myself. I barely know a lot of these ladies so I felt like an idiot that I lost it in front of everyone. 

Today the person leading the committee sent out an email about our next meeting, which included this: 

>Access to abortion is a necessary and inalienable right. Discussing it can also be hard for people, for a wide number of reasons (to avoid making anyone feel subtly called out, I'll volunteer that as a trans woman and someone with a condition that some might want to screen a fetus for before deciding whether to carry to term, it is sometimes hard for me). It's important to remember that having such a reaction doesn't speak ill of one's politics or commitment to reproductive rights. Likewise, I will work to facilitate a mindful, conscientious meeting space that is supportive of those experiences, and I welcome anyone who needs it to take space or to gently call-in if someone's behavior is coming across as flippant. Especially if it's me.

Little background - 28yo, PCOS, been trying naturally for 3 years. Apologies in advance for format issues, I'm on mobile.



I'm an LPN student and we just started our class in obstetrics. I knew this would be a hard one for me, and thought I was prepared. First couple days were fine but today....Today just sucked. My class is mostly female, and over half are parents. Today was just chock full of ""I found out this way"" and ""I was doing this just before I found out"" and, my favorite, ""I did this wrong during my pregnancy/I wasn't even trying"" stories.

28,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So I had thought IVF was completely out of the picture for us financially, but had kind of a breakdown to my mom and she and my dad have somehow managed to come up with $10K to support us if that's the route we have to take. We're not quite there yet, but I'm trying to be realistic about our IUI odds and I'm a planner, so I'm thinking ahead. We could probably get another $5-10K out of our house (maybe), but we just bought it (exhausting our limited savings, maybe badly timed in retrospect) and don't have much equity, so I'd say $15-20K is probably our max total budget. 

I've been looking into international IVF, but I read all your stories on here about how many tries it often takes, and I know they stim gently there so potentially less embryos per cycle, and I'd use up all the vacation and sick time I'd been saving up (naively) for maternity leave. But, all that said, I could probably pull off IVF in the Czech Republic for $6K +2K or so for any follow up FETs. So that gives me potentially a least 2, maybe 3 retrievals (if we freeze his sperm so only I have to travel for follow-ups) and a couple of FETs potentially within our budget. Also, all the IVF ""extras"" are way cheaper there - ICSI, time lapse monitoring, PGS, etc). Most of my travel time could be paid, but his wouldn't be, and I'd have zero left for maternity leave if I ever actually get pregnant (though I do have 6 weeks partially paid because I'm in CA). The vacation together would be awesome, but who knows how sick I'd feel during it, and then whatever follow-ups would be me traveling alone, and potentially even stimming alone in a foreign country, so that sounds potentially pretty shitty, even in a cool place. 

Second option is Kaiser, which is my main provider and the clinic I've been going to so far, who have pretty good IVF success rates (best in my region as far as I can tell) and an average price of $10K plus meds ($5K-ish) per cycle. It's close to home, much less time off work, and may be more likely to give me more embryos in a single cycle due to more aggressive stimming. But we could really only afford one cycle plus a FET or two - it's unlikely we could afford two cycles of retrievals. If we wait until next January (my 37th birthday) I can switch insurance and look for non-Kaiser options. If I get the most expensive insurance my job offers (still not that expensive), I can even go anywhere in the country. No IVF coverage regardless, though, and if I do get pregnant it will make birth more expensive ($250 at Kaiser versus 20% co-pay anywhere else). 

Last option is embryo donation, and we live near California Conceptions with the $12K for 3 transfers shared risk program - success (to 12 weeks) or your money back. Plus $1K nonrefundable meds per cycle. But we really do want a bio kid if possible, and are currently unexplained, so no real info on how possible that might be makes this a hard option to consider first.  

What am I missing? If you had limited funds would you go for 1 cycle of close to home IVF or 2+ cycles on the other side of the world? I guess I'm not looking for advice on what to do (obviously all this is very personal) so much as advice on what I should be thinking about that I'm not. 

There's also the option of using donor eggs overseas, which we could do 1 or maybe 2 cycles of, but I'm not sure we could make that work financially after trying IVF first. And I understand IVF is kind of diagnostic as well, so I'm not sure if I could make a decision to go straight to donor egg without having any information about my egg quality. So far all my blood tests have been fine. 

Any thoughts welcome, sorry for the novel! 

EDIT: One other piece of the picture is that IUIs (we plan to start next cycle) are only $130 per cycle for me, so even though our odds aren't great (RE says 6%), we could keep doing that for a while. I know they say your odds go down after 3, but I do see people who get pregnant after 4 or 5 or 6, so that's a low cost option we could keep trying. So far I respond well to letrozole (2-3 follicles). I'm just nervous about our chances of success with IVF going down the longer we wait to pursue that option.

We&#39;re not quite there yet, but I&#39;m trying to be realistic about our IUI odds and I&#39;m a planner, so I&#39;m thinking ahead. We could probably get another $5-10K out of our house (maybe), but we just bought it (exhausting our limited savings, maybe badly timed in retrospect) and don&#39;t have much equity, so I&#39;d say $15-20K is probably our max total budget. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking into international IVF, but I read all your stories on here about how many tries it often takes, and I know they stim gently there so potentially less embryos per cycle, and I&#39;d use up all the vacation and sick time I&#39;d been saving up (naively) for maternity leave. But, all that said, I could probably pull off IVF in the Czech Republic for $6K +2K or so for any follow up FETs. So that gives me potentially a least 2, maybe 3 retrievals (if we freeze his sperm so only I have to travel for follow-ups) and a couple of FETs potentially within our budget. Also, all the IVF &quot;extras&quot; are way cheaper there - ICSI, time lapse monitoring, PGS, etc). Most of my travel time could be paid, but his wouldn&#39;t be, and I&#39;d have zero left for maternity leave if I ever actually get pregnant (though I do have 6 weeks partially paid because I&#39;m in CA). The vacation together would be awesome, but who knows how sick I&#39;d feel during it, and then whatever follow-ups would be me traveling alone, and potentially even stimming alone in a foreign country, so that sounds potentially pretty shitty, even in a cool place. </p>

<p>Second option is Kaiser, which is my main provider and the clinic I&#39;ve been going to so far, who have pretty good IVF success rates (best in my region as far as I can tell) and an average price of $10K plus meds ($5K-ish) per cycle. It&#39;s close to home, much less time off work, and may be more likely to give me more embryos in a single cycle due to more aggressive stimming. But we could really only afford one cycle plus a FET or two - it&#39;s unlikely we could afford two cycles of retrievals. If we wait until next January (my 37th birthday) I can switch insurance and look for non-Kaiser options. If I get the most expensive insurance my job offers (still not that expensive), I can even go anywhere in the country. No IVF coverage regardless, though, and if I do get pregnant it will make birth more expensive ($250 at Kaiser versus 20% co-pay anywhere else). </p>

<p>Last option is embryo donation, and we live near California Conceptions with the $12K for 3 transfers shared risk program - success (to 12 weeks) or your money back. Plus $1K nonrefundable meds per cycle. But we really do want a bio kid if possible, and are currently unexplained, so no real info on how possible that might be makes this a hard option to consider first.  </p>

<p>What am I missing? If you had limited funds would you go for 1 cycle of close to home IVF or 2+ cycles on the other side of the world? I guess I&#39;m not looking for advice on what to do (obviously all this is very personal) so much as advice on what I should be thinking about that I&#39;m not. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the option of using donor eggs overseas, which we could do 1 or maybe 2 cycles of, but I&#39;m not sure we could make that work financially after trying IVF first. And I understand IVF is kind of diagnostic as well, so I&#39;m not sure if I could make a decision to go straight to donor egg without having any information about my egg quality. So far all my blood tests have been fine. </p>

<p>Any thoughts welcome, sorry for the novel! </p>

<p>EDIT: One other piece of the picture is that IUIs (we plan to start next cycle) are only $130 per cycle for me, so even though our odds aren&#39;t great (RE says 6%), we could keep doing that for a while. I know they say your odds go down after 3, but I do see people who get pregnant after 4 or 5 or 6, so that&#39;s a low cost option we could keep trying. So far I respond well to letrozole (2-3 follicles). I&#39;m just nervous about our chances of success with IVF going down the longer we wait to pursue that option. </p>

I live in the UK and my husband (29) and I (28) have been trying to conceive for a year and half now. He went to his GP today for the results of a recent sperm test that he had and it's come back that everything's fine in that area. So it might very well be me that has a problem.

Since I came off the pill over a year and a half ago, my cycle has been all over the place: varying from 27 days to 44 days! Over the past 2 months I've been doing daily ovulation tests and have yet to have a positive result.

So, technically it's time for me to get myself checked out, but I have a worry. My BMI is 36.3 = Obese. I haven't needed to go to the GP for about 2 years and it's in that time that the weight's piled on (I suffer from depression and I don't want to be on medication for it while I'm trying to conceive, so my waistline has suffered for it as a coping mechanism), so as far as the GP knows, I'm still a sensible weight. I'm currently on a weight-loss journey and I started with a BMI of 40.7. I've still got a long way to go, I know.

Has anyone found that their weight has had an effect on what steps the GP will take to investigate the infertility? I'm worried that they'll turn around and tell me to lose weight first, then wait another year or so, then they'll investigate.

For those of you following the RESOLVE meeting story about the shit show the last meeting was..
The meeting last night was completely different! Totally worth what ended up being a 2 hour drive home. The peer leader was just as mindful and wonderful in person as she was in her emails prior. There were 8 of us there total; apparently the largest group since they began meeting in December. Everyone was 110% appropriate and supportive of each other. 
The leader began with a little mandatory blurb about how she's not a licensed psychologist or doc and that we should all expect confidentiality; what we share in the room would stay in the room. Less than 5 minutes and the meeting was already better than the other one I attended.
We then spent 2 hours sharing our stories, asking for advice and talking about how to navigate social and professional situations that focus on fertility/children etc. There was one woman who expressed that she wasn't ready to share her story and no one pressured her to speak. It seemed to be a comfortable environment for everyone. Some of us stayed an extra 20 minutes to chat about non IF stuff in the lobby. I plan to attend again. If this is how support meetings should be thru RESOLVE then I'm interested in helping start one closer to home. 
I drove home feeling relieved to have a group of folks IRL who 'get it'. 
And in an extra support win my best friend called to check in with how things have been going with treatment. She wanted to remind me that if I wanted to hang out with her minus her kid and husband and talk about non IF/kid stuff then she would be game. I feel like with all the non supportive stuff that's been thrown at me lately I want to do a little happy dance.

I'm on day two of stims. My husband and I did IVF a few years ago. I can't even believe we did that at that time because our life was a total clusterfuck. He is a recovering addict and I found his secret vodka the DAY OF the embryo transfer. I made the near-impossible decision and went ahead with the procedure because I felt like we had come so far and spent so much money and there was no way I was quitting the cycle on the day of the transfer. The whole thing was so dark.

Now, don't get me wrong, I made my choices in marrying an addict, but the relapse was not on my radar during the cycle, until it was. And, in hindsight, he was drunk for most of it. The whole cycle was a hot mess. I felt completely neglected and unsupported.

Now we're doing it again, and we are in a much better place, against any and all possible odds. He went to rehab. We did a lot of therapy. We sat down last week and he told me just how much he's looking forward to making this cycle different, supporting me, and celebrating how much things have changed.

He hasn't relapsed again. No. But something else has happened completely out of the blue that has hit this cycle like a freaking asteroid. My mother in law had a heart attack today, and she goes in for a quadruple bypass surgery on Wednesday.

I love this woman. My husband loves this woman. She could well die, the surgeon was very clear on how serious of a procedure this is. I am, of course, completely concerned about her and about supporting my husband as he grapples with some very difficult emotions.

But...

I want support, too. The first cycle, I felt like I was doing it completely alone. It was awful. I was really looking forward to having some of the attention and support. Not just because doing an IVF cycle sucks. But, I'll admit, to help me get over how shitty last time was. And here we have this complete fluke that has overshadowed everything. Just like the relapse did last time.

I'm empathizing, I'm supporting, I'm giving, I'm doing everything I should be and want to be doing for my husband and in-laws. But on the inside. God damn it, I just want a little bit of freaking support. I want to just do this IVF cycle and have an IVF cycle be enough drama for the week because it's intense in and of itself. I want to pout a little bit if I'm feeling moody. I want to talk about my feelings. And here I am, holding my sobbing husband. And I feel like a bad person for having these feelings... But god damn it.

56,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone who reads this! Lol 

I've been lurking for a few weeks? Maybe a month on this sub and I figure I'll finally make a post semi-introducing myself and semi-venting.

I'm 20, my husband is 23 and we have been TTC for over 2 years now. Please don't judge us by our age! My husband and I will have been married for 3 years in May and have been together 6 years in December. We have a beautiful relationship and would never thing about TTC unless we knew we were ready. He is Military (American) and we have our ducks in a row to be able to support a child if we should be able to finally conceive.

I found out a year ago this April that I have PCOS. That was after roughly 6 months prior to that having been misdiagnosed with well nothing. It took over a year before I finally was diagnosed. I was seeing an on base doctor, and unfortunately the base we are at is very small so they only have a clinic and can't do much. So I had to be referred out and this cased the process to take quite some time to get diagnosed. The first place said I had nothing wrong with me. And well we sat on that for a year. Yet I was still not having periods for months on end. No positive OPK's. My husband and I stopped trying. Then when we decided to try again I confronted my on base doctor and she sent me to a better facility. I say better because they were able to diagnose me with PCOS. 

I went on treatment after months of bloodwork to confirm I do not ovulate on my own. I started Femara 5mgs. I was calling my doctor multiple times a week for these past few months to tell her I've started my medication, I've started my period, etc. So when I started the Femara it was no different. I had been right in the middle of my first treatment (last October) when I found out my doctor was no longer at our clinic. I was waiting for them to call me about my blood results and needing to get my prescription for Provera filled so that I could have my period. No one called me. No one. I had called after waiting 2 weeks past when they were supposed to call me. I was crushed. I mean seriously? Whose doctor just vanishes in the middle of treatment. So I couldn't handle the stress and just needed a break to gather up my strength to fight my infertility once more. 

I went on birth control so that I could have my period. I was on it for 3 months and now am ready to start trying again. I'm going to be seeing an off base doctor now and am more hopeful for it even though all the RE's are an hour to an hour and a half away. Oh well. I'm hopeful and terrified. The amount of stress this stuff puts me through and how hormonally wacky I get isn't that fun either. Not to mention I don't have as solid a support system as I could hope for. 

It's incredibly true that people who haven't experienced infertility cannot understand your feelings. I have no female friends here at this base and that is not for a lack of trying. All of my friends are almost 2,000 miles from me and are in different spots in life that most of what I go through and deal with they can't really understand my feelings on it. My Mom (also as far) is supportive but not terribly well. If I feel like venting about say so and so's pregnancy announcement (even though I know that one person's fertility has nothing to do with mine) she tells me to stop being so judgmental, etc. In fact the night before I got my diagnoses I was having insomnia due to all the anxiety about what the results would be and called her to try and work through it. She told me that she thinks that I want something to be wrong with me. As if I want an excuse for x y and z. 

I'm stressing out over that fact that I have no one other than my husband. He is the most amazing person in my life hands down and is the ultimate supporter of me and I could not ask for more out of him. Just I wish that I had the other people in my life to support me and that I didn't have to sit and watch other people end up pregnant. 

Just sucks that I, financially stable, in a great marrige, and desperately wanting a kid, can't concieve.

57,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Today I went to my friend's second child's christening. The actual event was ok. It was one of those Catholic christenings where they do four babies at the time. I have no trouble being legitimately happy for my friends, but I can't be happy for three other random families, that's too much to ask. I did manage to hold it together like a normal human during the service, so whatever.

Problem arises at the party afterwards. My friend asks what our status with treatments is (awaiting FET at the end of the month), which is totally fine, he knows what we've been dealing with and has been supportive. His choice of time/location to ask for an update was poor, though. There were other people right within earshot which makes me uncomfortable, even if they aren't listening, because we're a little more private about our infertility than that.

A little later my friend's wife asks for our status (fine) also with other people right there, literally as she's handing her child off to someone else (not fine). So we update her and it was ok until she starts to ask about feelings and everything goes rapidly downhill. It would have been ok if I were self aware enough to ask that we discuss this another time, but I always grossly overestimate my ability to keep my shit together.

So I'm standing there talking to her, tears streaming down my face, Mr. Waffles looking on helplessly, and OH YEAH we're in a room with 8-10 other people who I do not know and with whom I would not discuss my infertility with given a choice. 

I think my friend got to a point where she just couldn't go back. Like, she saw I was obviously upset but she couldn't unask what she was asking about without feeling insensitive? She also included several anecdotes (these especially did not go over well with Mr. Waffles) about her parents taking 9 years to get pregnant (not helpful), her co-worker's miscarriage (also not helpful), and her co-worker's subsequent loss at 29 weeks (definitely not helpful).

She truly is a lovely person and she truly was trying to be supportive so I'm really not mad, more like completely befuddled. Why couldn't we talk about my recent trip to San Francisco? I tried really hard to talk about that.

If you want the full details, which I am happy to share with you because I appreciate your sincere support, why not ask privately or call me sometime? She apologized as we were leaving but it was horrid. The very last thing I want is to inadvertently make a scene at your kid's christening party. I don't mind crying in front of a friend who is trying to help. I do mind crying in front of all of their family and friends. The whole thing was exhausting.

<p>So I&#39;m standing there talking to her, tears streaming down my face, Mr. Waffles looking on helplessly, and OH YEAH we&#39;re in a room with 8-10 other people who I do not know and with whom I would not discuss my infertility with given a choice. </p>

<p>I think my friend got to a point where she just couldn&#39;t go back. Like, she saw I was obviously upset but she couldn&#39;t unask what she was asking about without feeling insensitive? She also included several anecdotes (these especially did not go over well with Mr. Waffles) about her parents taking 9 years to get pregnant (not helpful), her co-worker&#39;s miscarriage (also not helpful), and her co-worker&#39;s subsequent loss at 29 weeks (definitely not helpful).</p>

<p>She truly is a lovely person and she truly was trying to be supportive so I&#39;m really not mad, more like completely befuddled. Why couldn&#39;t we talk about my recent trip to San Francisco? I tried really hard to talk about that.</p>

<p>If you want the full details, which I am happy to share with you because I appreciate your sincere support, why not ask privately or call me sometime? She apologized as we were leaving but it was horrid. The very last thing I want is to inadvertently make a scene at your kid&#39;s christening party. I don&#39;t mind crying in front of a friend who is trying to help. I do mind crying in front of all of their family and friends. The whole thing was exhausting. It&#39;s clearly much easier to stay here on my couch with my weenie dogs consuming too much sugar than to go anywhere. </p>

62,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all!

A little bit about me - I'm 31 and hubby is 34. I'm overweight but otherwise we're both healthy. My periods have always been like clockwork. During the last year they have started to become slightly abnormal for me, but nothing too drastic (29 day cycle 1 month and 31 the next instead of my normal 28.) Hormones have always messed with my system (birth control makes me freakin crazy! and makes me pass out) so I haven't been on birth control for the better part of 10 years, aside from a short stint with an IUD. I've also struggled with BV for the better part of 10 years but FINALLY managed to get that under control with the help of Mayan Abdominal Massage. I know it sounds a bit hinky, but it worked for me so I'm not going to knock it. 

I've gone through cycles of trying to conceive throughout the years, but the majority of it was spent with a not trying but not preventing mindset. My first husband and I tried from the time I was 19 to 23 and absolutely nothing. He went on to have a little one within a year of our split. Fast forward to my next major relationship...tried and tried and nothing. We both started getting tested just to see if it was even a possibility. Blood work, ultrasound, semen analysis, and HSG all looked great. Absolutely nothing to note other than I have a tilted uterus. That relationship ultimately ended and he too went on to have a child within a year of our split. 

So, now I am in the same spot with current hubby. We have never used protection. And...nothing. My current gynecologist did another blood workup and ultrasound and said that everything looks normal. He said he sees nothing that should be preventing me from getting pregnant. He said the next step is surgery to check out the uterus. While I'm not ruling that out in the long run, it's not something I'm ready to do just yet. 

Thankfully there is an RE about an hour away (does anyone have experience with Dr Bacchus in Northern Colorado?) I've called the office and gotten some preliminary information, but keep putting off making the appointment. Part of me keeps thinking maybe for the last decade maybe the timing wasn't right. Maybe my mind, my body, something needed me to be in a better place. Maybe now my body will just decide to cooperate. But then I realize it's been a decade and before I know it another decade will have gone by. 

So, that's me in a nutshell. I apologize if it was a bit rambling and unorganized. I've been on night shift for the last 6 months (we normally do night to day rotations every 3 months but I got the short end of the stick this time) and my brain is a bit frazzled. 

*Update - Thank you all for the support and information! We've decided to make an appointment with an RE (assuming I can actually get some days off at some point.) Even if we don't decide to begin treatment it will be good to know if/what the problem is.

My best friend in the world has seen me in good, bad, and everything in between. We both moved to a new neighborhood in the summer before 8th grade, bonded over being ""the new kids"", and have been thick as theives ever since. When we were younger and the whole world lay ahead of us so perfectly planned, we were going to stick together - we planned to buy houses near each other, make sure each other's guys were ""the one"", help each other plan our weddings, and eventually have families at the same time so our kids could grow up with built-in best friends like their moms.

The house part worked out according to plan. 

Then the married part worked out according to plan (or so we thought at the time). 

Then the other shoe dropped... her soldier husband got sent to an active war zone. We sat together and held hands while we watched every news report. We watched stupid movies to distract her. We sat on her sofa and cried together worried about him. 

Then, miraculously, he came home unscathed. He was home for about 4 minutes when he got orders that he'd have to go back in a few months...and that's where our plans began to unravel. 

It's now almost 6 years later, and they have two beautiful kids, a warm and inviting home, great jobs, and a strong future together. 

What do I have to show for the last 6 years? I get to go sit at their dinner table from time to time and love on her babies. That's what I spent the last 4 hours doing (because I refuse to let my health steal another single drop of joy from my life), and if that wasn't enough, the period tracker app my OBGYN asked me to install on my last visit (cuz, ya know, I try to ignore the glaring monthly reminder of what I don't have, and she says that's bad for my medical records) just sent me a push notification that says ""Your chances of pregnancy drop significantly tomorrow.""

78,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"It’s Thursday night, actually it’s ridiculously early Friday. It is 1:19am. 

I am currently playing a local Christian radio station in the background.

It’s been an emotional day. Let’s talk about that later. My husband made a comment today, that he thought that this year, 2017 was suppose to be a better year than last year.

Last year. The year 2016. What a crappy year. Okay, so it wasn’t completely crappy, but what happened during the beginning of the year held onto us and carried through the whole year. That is what made it crappy. Crappy is probably an understatement. 

Lately and for quite some time I have preached to friends and given encouragement to them when they are facing tough times and obstacles in life, that there is always a reason for what we go through. That God is shaping us into the person He wants us to be. That there is hope at the end of whatever it is that they are facing.

Yet, here I am feeling like there is less hope. I don’t understand God’s reason for what we are facing. I don’t like what we are going through. It has made me think of the 2 other major obstacles that I have faced through out life and wondered why the heck I was going through it.

I mourned a loss today. Or at least what I believe to be a loss, because I am preparing myself for the worst case scenario. 

My husband and I have been struggling with infertility for almost the past two years. We’ve been struggling with some help from doctors for the last 15 months. 

In January of 2016 we experienced more joy than we had ever felt and the most sadness and loss that we had ever felt. All in the span of a month. We lost our first baby. 

I’ve lost a grandparent who I was really close to and it broke my heart, but it was nothing compared to this. I got so consumed in my sadness that I had for a while forgotten to think of how my husband was feeling because he was doing such a great job being supportive of me and putting on a strong face because of me.

After trying with no success by ourselves again, I booked another appointment for the beginning of this year with my gynaecologist to start more testing. After spending so much money on pregnancy tests and wasting them because I thought maybe it happened again, over and over. Over and over I saw negatives. I prayed. I cried. I talked to my husband. I talked with my mom. I talked with friends. I am so thankful for the support I have.

In the past year I was able to encourage and was there to support a friend who experienced a miscarriage because I knew exactly how it felt. I came to the realization and thanked God for being able to support my friend the way I was able to. I finally saw some light and small reason why we had gone through what we did. 

Yesterday. Thursday. I went for a follow-up appointment with my gyno, to go over the blood work that I had done during my last cycle. By the way, the last blood work I had done, the lady poked me so hard that my arm was killing me all day… that’s besides the point. But clearly I need to mention it. So during my appointment my doctor was looking over the results. He commented on how he wished I had gone to the same Lab for both times. He then couldn’t find a test that he was looking for. He kept flipping the pages, over and over. He then found it. He commented on how it was high and he hoped that it was an error because if it wasn’t that it wasn’t a good thing when you are trying to become pregnant. My heart sunk. I didn’t know what to say. Here I was sitting on a table, undressed from the waist down dreading a pap test, and I was hit out of left field. He continued to say that my FSH levels were high. He pointed to them and they read a 12.6. He said that it should be below 10 and that 12.6 was high which meant that my egg reserve was low. He said he was going to send me to have it tested again. 

I had my regular exam. Uncomfortable. He wrote me a requisition to have the blood test done again and to come back after it.

So I’m choosing to believe that it was correct. All of my other levels were good. I turn 30 this year. This year…was suppose to be a better year. A year of hope. We needed hope. My husband lost hope last year and was so disappointed with how things turned out that now he’s indifferent to children. It’s reassuring that he’s happy and will be content if it’s just the two of us through-out our lives. He’s been so supportive through-out everything. I am so thankful that I have him.

Today I grieve a loss… of hope. I don’t know what to do. God knows that ever since I can remember all I’ve wanted to be when I grow up is a mom. I know that there is still a small possibility of that happening, but I’m not betting on it anymore. I don’t think I can. I get my hopes up all of the time and they always come crashing down. I can’t handle it anymore. 

I’ll keep praying.

It is 1:19am. </p>

<p>I am currently playing a local Christian radio station in the background.</p>

<p>It’s been an emotional day. Let’s talk about that later. My husband made a comment today, that he thought that this year, 2017 was suppose to be a better year than last year.</p>

<p>Last year. The year 2016. What a crappy year. Okay, so it wasn’t completely crappy, but what happened during the beginning of the year held onto us and carried through the whole year. That is what made it crappy. Crappy is probably an understatement. </p>

<p>Lately and for quite some time I have preached to friends and given encouragement to them when they are facing tough times and obstacles in life, that there is always a reason for what we go through. That God is shaping us into the person He wants us to be. That there is hope at the end of whatever it is that they are facing.</p>

<p>Yet, here I am feeling like there is less hope. I don’t understand God’s reason for what we are facing. I don’t like what we are going through. It has made me think of the 2 other major obstacles that I have faced through out life and wondered why the heck I was going through it.</p>

<p>I mourned a loss today. Or at least what I believe to be a loss, because I am preparing myself for the worst case scenario. </p>

<p>My husband and I have been struggling with infertility for almost the past two years. We’ve been struggling with some help from doctors for the last 15 months. </p>

<p>In January of 2016 we experienced more joy than we had ever felt and the most sadness and loss that we had ever felt. All in the span of a month. We lost our first baby. </p>

<p>I’ve lost a grandparent who I was really close to and it broke my heart, but it was nothing compared to this. I got so consumed in my sadness that I had for a while forgotten to think of how my husband was feeling because he was doing such a great job being supportive of me and putting on a strong face because of me.</p>

<p>After trying with no success by ourselves again, I booked another appointment for the beginning of this year with my gynaecologist to start more testing. After spending so much money on pregnancy tests and wasting them because I thought maybe it happened again, over and over. Over and over I saw negatives. I prayed. I cried. I talked to my husband. I talked with my mom. I talked with friends. I am so thankful for the support I have.</p>

<p>In the past year I was able to encourage and was there to support a friend who experienced a miscarriage because I knew exactly how it felt. I came to the realization and thanked God for being able to support my friend the way I was able to. I finally saw some light and small reason why we had gone through what we did. </p>

<p>Yesterday. Thursday. I went for a follow-up appointment with my gyno, to go over the blood work that I had done during my last cycle. By the way, the last blood work I had done, the lady poked me so hard that my arm was killing me all day… that’s besides the point. But clearly I need to mention it. So during my appointment my doctor was looking over the results. He commented on how he wished I had gone to the same Lab for both times. He then couldn’t find a test that he was looking for. He kept flipping the pages, over and over. He then found it. He commented on how it was high and he hoped that it was an error because if it wasn’t that it wasn’t a good thing when you are trying to become pregnant. My heart sunk. I didn’t know what to say. Here I was sitting on a table, undressed from the waist down dreading a pap test, and I was hit out of left field. He continued to say that my FSH levels were high. He pointed to them and they read a 12.6. He said that it should be below 10 and that 12.6 was high which meant that my egg reserve was low. He said he was going to send me to have it tested again. </p>

<p>I had my regular exam. Uncomfortable. He wrote me a requisition to have the blood test done again and to come back after it.</p>

I was pregnant for a few weeks. We've been TTC since late 2014 and drug our feet getting all the testing done. In Feb 2016, we were told we were straight to IVF-ICSI because of DOR and MFI. My first IVF (natural start antagonist) was converted to an IUI and despite low hopes for my second IVF (estrogen primed microdose lupron flare with human growth hormone), it went super duper well and I did a fresh transfer of 2 day 5 blastocysts (ended in a CP) and froze 4 day 6 blastocysts. 

My first FET was a single transfer of a 4AA from that round and it worked! Until it didn't. My first ultrasound was at 6 weeks + 4 days and saw a heartbeat, but it was a little slow and the embryo was measuring at 6w1d. Incidentally the heartbeat rate and size went together, but the RE was troubled because we knew within 12 hours when things happened. Follow up a week later (yesterday) scan showed the little thing had only grown for 2 more days and there was no heartbeat.

Now I'm waiting to see if D&C is an option at my clinic for Monday. If it is, awesome, I'm planning for that and will get the ""product"" tested. I should know by midday tomorrow if it is a go. If not, I'll try the cytotec at home and then go in for a scan to make sure everything has passed some time this upcoming week.

I cry because all my husband and I have ever wanted was a baby. Literally we were 18 and talking about eloping to Vegas and having a babies.

Well 10 years later and I've had kidney failure, cancer, drug addiction and no period for 3 years.

My doctors don't seem that concerned but I am. I can't get anyone to help me figure out why I'm not ovulating, i tracked my ovulation for 6 months using the home kits since my doctors didn't seem to care and nothing.

I'm taking some advice and trying to initiate a regular conversation with those of us who've been through the IF ringer but haven't been on this sub long enough to establish the enduring relationships that are the focus of the IFseniorclass sub. 

One reason I have felt uncomfortable posting here is because many of the folks seem to be early in their IF journey and I don't want to be that downer person who reminds everyone that its possible to go years and multiple rounds of IUIs, IVFs, donor eggs, etc. and still be trying. That said, its also a bit painful for me to see so many people on their 1st or 3rd IUI or first IVF because it reminds me of how much hope I had then and that I'm well past that point and still slogging along. 

I'm drawn to online community because IRL, the people I have relied on have not dealt with my experience all that well. Folks I riled up with excitement about how great my odds were deciding to use donor eggs now are nervous that even that isn't working. Even my mom has been hinting that we should give it up already even though we have two embryos left. Its true that my wife and I are depressed and nervous and that this process has left us with a form of PTSD but we are also still hopeful enough that we're following every single science-based and woo woo recommendation to get my body in the best possible shape to transfer the last two embryos (since we're out of money and can't do them separately). This is what we'll be doing for the next 2 to three months. After that, who the hell knows what comes? (Except for a vacation- we definitely need a vacation.)

What I would like most is a daily thread (maybe called the BTDT crew) to stay in touch regularly, on IF and non-IF issues. A daily reminder that we're not alone, there is hope, we are doing the best we can, and that there are funny and good things happening in our lives. I don't know that I could promise to post everyday but do know that I will look every day even if my work day is a hot mess. 

So, who are the ""sophomore"" or ""junior"" classes among us? What's your story? Would a daily whats up thread be something you'd look forward to? 

Thanks, hope every one is having a good Friday and St Paddy's.

The count will still be low but the quality better. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854097/ is a nice quick read.""

We have done 1 round of IVF/ICSI and are starting #2 next week. My RE said my egg quality was good but we only ended up with a 2BB and 2 morulas on day 5. My SO has severe MFI, with 0.1M total count at our last retrieval. His counts are due to a physical blockage, not a genetic issue. He has 3 teenagers.

I had to have a cyst drained to start cycle one to begin with after my clomid challenge the month before. I have rheumatoid arthritis which is complicating everything because I'm in pain, fatigued, and developing irreversible joint damage (especially in my jaw of all places- no more bjs for hubby any time soon!) since I cannot take my medication at all during any of this process, so not since October. 

My trigger shot was yesterday and I have retrieval tomorrow morning. I'm scared to death. I've been so calm for so long and now I'm just flipping out. 

Then this morning we realized our older puppy boy was not urinating. So I've spent all day at the vet waiting for him to be seen for a walk in only to be transferred to the ER because he has kidney stones and is going into renal failure and the very couldn't get the catheter in to clear the stone and start stabilizing him.

I'm 23 almost 24 me and my husband have been having unprotected sex for about 3 years now and as far as I know I haven't gotten pregnant once. My period is extremely irregular which makes it hard to actually try to get pregnant. I know my weight has a lot to do with it and I'm taking steps to get that under control.

I have been on my period for about 3 months now with a fairly heavy flow. It's getting to the point where I had to take 2 days off work because I was dizzy, nauseous, and thought I was going to pass out, which would be bad because I deliver pizzas. I've been looking for a fun gyno because of this but none of the ones that accept my insurance don't have any openings until June or July. So I'm going to the walk in clinic to see if they can prescribe something to at least stop the bleeding until I can see someone.

Anyway to the point of my post. I'm afraid to go to the doctor. I'm afraid they're going to tell me I'm sterile. That they're going to say I have pcos and it's so bad that my ovaries are basically one big cyst. Rationally I know that last one probably won't happen but I'm still terrified.

Ever since I was young I've wanted nothing more than to be a mom. My husband really wants to be a dad, and I'm terrified that I won't be able to make it happen.

We've already talked about adopting if we can't have kids of our own, but it's probably going to kill me if we get told that we can't have kids of our own.

Repeat tests I took already ( TSH, FSH pap?) mostly bloods? Some of the medical tests on the community info seem kinda involved for a first visit no? 


Update:

MD was a pleasant Guy with a straight talk type of demeanor. , he diagnosed me with ""unexplained"" because Mr Rocky has two kids and I (TRIGGER WARNING) I had conceived in my early 20s, confirmed by ultrasound, forced into a D/C by my mother (TRiGGER ENDS) but nothing since.

He asked if I had difficulty conceiving in a previous relationship, I said my last one we used condoms religiously. He asked me what I thought the problem was, and ruled out PCOS ( you have to miss more than one period and I've never missed one except if I didn't ovulate or I that time I conceived) he actually showed me a power point on PCOS he gave to resident this year and we went over it. 

Then I brought up endo, and he said we wouldn't know unless we went in surgically l.. He would rather start the tests first.

So thanks to you ladies, I knew what to ask and what everything meant. 

My insurance (Kaiser) will cover six cycles of IUI with Clomid or Menopur? For either me or Mr Rocky. It's a 50/50 shared cost so he said, if you have questions email me so I do t have to bill you. 

Mr Rocky has to do his thing in a cup and get STD tests, I have to do labs (FSH, AmH and one other one ) day three and that thing for your tubes day 1 (well call on day 1 and do it after my cycle is done).

He wasn't worried about spotting. He wasn't worried about missed period. He said baseline FSH was perfect. TSH WNL. Pap normal HPV normal.

He also said success rate in my age group was 14.7% percent, but also said that's based on the population size which is already full of barren bitches, and my success rate would be 25% if I had a living child.

He gave me the option of trying this or going straight to IVF, I told him I want to see what's wrong. And go from there.

TMI: Having some answers is better than nothing. Knowing that my PAP and HPV were negative was more of a relief than all of this, as I had bad paps after the D/C in my 20s. 

Also knowing it's not my thyroid or I'm going through menopause is a relief.

So, hopefully it's something I can work with. Better than batting donut, as my old man would say.

I just wish I had started years ago, but I didn't have insurance other than Medicare then, and my dads sudden death just put all the ""me shit"" on the back burner.

Not to mention Mr Rockys ex having CPS taking the kids and placing Mr Rockys kids with us, was expecting two teen boys in my house full time. Plus the endless barrage of CSWs, therapists, doc appointments..

My ""friend"", who knows of my struggles and is going through her own, is also applying to the job. Usually I would smile and wish her the best and actually mean it.

But not this time. I already did that the last time we competed for a job and look where the fuck it got me. I'm being petty and way too sensitive but I can't just smile and wish her luck. I feel like she is being greedy and power-hungry. She and I are working at the same place but she has a higher position than I do and she is already working 40 hrs. She was hired less then 4 months ago after transferring from a different branch in our network. The pay for the new job pays about the same as to what she is making now. It would be a HUGE step for me to get this job while for her it would be just another baby step. 

The straw me that broke that my back was this week.  
Without going into too much detail, I feel like she tried to sabotage me today. She turned down a tour request from our boss and when he rescheduled and asked me instead, she showed up to my tour. The only reason he asked her to begin with was because I was going to be busy during the original requested date. When she found out that he asked me she told me ""well there goes my chances of getting the new job"". Then she showed up today during my tour. To say I was shocked and stunned would be an understatement. 
Normally I would be all smiles and happy to have her with me. But I'm doubting her intentions and her character. I feel like she showed up today to save face for saying no in the first place.
For fuck's sake let me shine. Let me have that little joy in my sea of heartache and misery. Let me breathe and forget that I'm broken. Let me focus on my future without obsessing about the what ifs. 

I am questioning our friendship. As God is my witness, if the roles were reversed I would not have even applied. I am not asking her to back out. It's her right to apply to whichever job she feels would move her forward in her career. No I want her to be moral and have some dignity. I want to be reminded as to why she is my friend. I am hurt by her actions and her lack of respect to my struggles and needs. I don't only want this job, I need it.

<p>For what it&#39;s worth,  this appears to be a light case of the shingles- uncomfortable and wardrobe restricting (no underwire bras for me!) but not requiring narcotics or driving me completely bonkers.</p>

<p>Thank you for any insight! </p>

I'm not sure how well ""spouse wholly unable to parent due to severe chronic illness"" fits within the ""having trouble conceiving"" space of this sub, so please let me know if this post is not appropriate here. I just needed to talk to people who understand. 

I've been lurking for a while because I'm having trouble with not being able to (try to) conceive. I'm coming up on 35, my biological clock is ringing at full volume, life is full of pregnant friends and friends with babies (there were 10 born within a 3 month period last year - it's ridiculous), a very close friend is currently in labour (which is probably why I can't sleep and am posting), and it all hurts. I want a family so desperately but my spouse, who was my best friend for a decade before we got together, developed a severe and untreatable chronic illness five years ago and is still very incapacitated - there are days when he doesn't have the strength to sit up or open his eyes so there is no way he can parent, the sleep disruption alone could hospitalise him. And he is my heart, so there is no way I can conceive of parenting without him. The doctors say that he will probably get better with (a completely unquantifiable amount of) time, and he is making gradual gains, but there is a very real chance that my eggs will be hard boiled by the time that he's well enough to be a dad. 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?

<p>I&#39;m not sure how well &quot;spouse wholly unable to parent due to severe chronic illness&quot; fits within the &quot;having trouble conceiving&quot; space of this sub, so please let me know if this post is not appropriate here. I just needed to talk to people who understand. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been lurking for a while because I&#39;m having trouble with not being able to (try to) conceive. I&#39;m coming up on 35, my biological clock is ringing at full volume, life is full of pregnant friends and friends with babies (there were 10 born within a 3 month period last year - it&#39;s ridiculous), a very close friend is currently in labour (which is probably why I can&#39;t sleep and am posting), and it all hurts. I want a family so desperately but my spouse, who was my best friend for a decade before we got together, developed a severe and untreatable chronic illness five years ago and is still very incapacitated - there are days when he doesn&#39;t have the strength to sit up or open his eyes so there is no way he can parent, the sleep disruption alone could hospitalise him. And he is my heart, so there is no way I can conceive of parenting without him. The doctors say that he will probably get better with (a completely unquantifiable amount of) time, and he is making gradual gains, but there is a very real chance that my eggs will be hard boiled by the time that he&#39;s well enough to be a dad. 2 years? 5 years? 10 years? They&#39;re all equally possible. </p>

My wife and I have TTC for 8 cycles now without success (I wouldn't normally post in /r/infertility after only 8 cycles, but we have a documented issue).  Transvaginal ultrasound and bloodwork look great on my wife, and she is going for an HSG in a few weeks to confirm the tubes look good.  [Her cycle length](http://imgur.com/a/299s8) varies a little bit, but outside of one long cycle are mostly consistent.  We are pretty sure we just missed the testing window with OPKs on the couple months that are blank, but we can't be positive.  Regardless, we had sex around when we suspect O would occur for the missing months.  The last cycle was 36 days (not on the sheet), so the luteal phases we can track have all been consistent at 15 days.

However, [my SA came back](http://imgur.com/a/7rO5r) a while back, and it shows 3% morph, motility slightly low (but still within range), and good count.  Andrologist says it should be fine, but the RE isn't so sure.  Wife and I are in agreement that we want to try on our own until the end of the year then go into IVF/ICSI if we haven't had success by then.

We began a new round of IVF last night.  Hopefully the last one.

* [Flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_76RK_5bBs) Cycle #4 “This should be the last one”
* [Flashback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpUUa--sQG4) Cycle #3: “If we get another 3, we’re good to go!”
* [Flashback](https://youtu.be/HUGFJNrOJus?t=8s) Cycle #2: “Maybe the first cycle was just a fluke.  This time we’ll get much more and have all we need”
* [Flashback](https://youtu.be/3RBwETvI5IY?t=23s) Cycle #1: “Oh look honey, most girls get like 15 eggs, so this will be no problem. The doctor is being so weird to hint that we might need more than 1 cycle.  That’s crazy-talk.  One and done baby!”

We’ve been trying to get to at least 8 embryos before doing our PGD test for the Fragile X chromosome since you can test up to 12 and have to pay to test again.  “Buy 1 and get a 2nd test for twice the price!” We have 7 in the [freezer](http://www.tvfoodanddrink.com/pics_feb11/mg_eggs_in_freezer.jpg) so we technically only need 1 to reach our minimum threshold.  But of course we would love to amazingly get all the way to 12.  And simultaneously fear getting none.

The added bonus was my wife got to escape the [hormone fueled drug haze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OwsNqXm1b8) she’s been in for 6+ months.  She was normal again.

But now she is heading back into [The Drug Dungeon](https://youtu.be/dM69fGwQDy8?t=41s).  It was painful to watch last night.  I could see the dread as she did the shots and watched the exuberance seem to drain from her body.

What’s also getting difficult for me is that I am losing sight of the end-goal --- The Actual Baby TM.  Initially, the embryos felt exciting and held such promise.  “Can I get a [picture](http://www.advancedfertility.com/images/hatched-blastocyst.jpg) of them to show people?!”  Now they are just things in a lab somewhere.  These cycles have just become a part of our life.  Saving up money, shots, retrieval, result, repeat.  A thing we do with no major progress or change.  And still many more steps still to go.  So the thought of the baby feels so intangible now.  Something we talk about just like winning the lottery, but even less immediate since that could happen within a day.

</ul>

<p>We’ve been trying to get to at least 8 embryos before doing our PGD test for the Fragile X chromosome since you can test up to 12 and have to pay to test again.  “Buy 1 and get a 2nd test for twice the price!” We have 7 in the <a href=""http://www.tvfoodanddrink.com/pics_feb11/mg_eggs_in_freezer.jpg"">freezer</a> so we technically only need 1 to reach our minimum threshold.

I have been seeing an RE since august and have had two miscarriages - one conceived without assistance and the second was medicated and IUI.  I have been annoyed with my RE for a while now; it's a huge facility, I rarely speak to my doctor and the nurses seem to have no idea what is going on and I've been given wrong information in the past.  A little bit of background before I get to my question - the successful cycle that ended in miscarriage I was triggered on day nine with the IUI on day eleven.  I have asked that we move the ultrasound and bloodwork in my next cycles up a day to correspond with the successful cycle's timing and have had resistance from the nurse. We ended up doing two cycles with the normal timing that were unsuccessful.  This cycle I really pushed to be seen a day early on day nine and was excited to find out that I had two follicles that were large (16 and 22, lining was at 10.33) and the nurse told me I should trigger that night. This is where my distrust comes in - I get a call from a different nurse (this is normal) that afternoon with my bloodwork results and the nurse says not to trigger that night but the next.

After I hung up I started thinking about how not ok her reasoning was so I called her back and asked about the reasoning again to which she responded that my LH levels were at 3 so I wasn't surging which is the real reason to push the procedure back by a day.

I guess my story starts young - I was 18 when I played my ""v card"" against a guy who told me it was his first time too (spoiler alert: it wasn't!), but I didn't find out how much damage resulted from the STI he gave me until I was 21. Three 1st trimester MC later (because why wait til we're married and financially stable? We aren't getting any younger! Got the news of #1 on Mother's Day, and confirmations of #2 on Valentine's Day, and #3 on his BDay - how's that for a trifecta?) and still seeing the same OBGYN who didn't even tell me my STI tests came back + when I was 19, I went in for my well woman's check whilst still engaged to my ex-husband, and started what became a loooong series of abnormal paps. Flash forward, been married a year at this point, and go in for what seems like yet another in a long line of inconclusive testing, to be told that they think it's suddenly advanced stage cervical cancer and that the only treatment is burning away my cervix (result: 7 yrs of no babymaking), but wait! There's more! Some hormone testing showed seriously progressed early onset Menopause, so if I don't go through with cancer treatment I basically have a year or two max to have a family, that is if I put off cancer treatment that long. Then-Husband can't handle seeing me go through cancer treatment and can't see himself never getting to have biological kids of his own, so he bails. (To be fair, we were young and I really don't blame him for it. It was really freaking scary and he was never good at scary!) I transfer to a specialty hospital & oncology team and all that, go through another year of tests and monitoring where they decide that course of treatment is too severe, because it's not actually cancer yet - so now it's just the dread waiting game (interspersed with ridiculously painful biopsies every 8-12 weeks). While going through their other testing, however, they did find a degenerative nervous system condition (think MS, but without brain lesions) so testing wasn't a total loss. Treating the new condition, monitoring for cervical cancer, and going through a messy divorce left me a bit out in the cold so I changed my scenery for a while (literally! I moved to the mountains of CO from the TX coast hehe), and eventually back. 

In the present, I've been back home in TX for about 2.5 years now. Finally have a better OBGYN (hey, she even knows how to tell me what she's diagnosing me with and what test results mean! What a concept!), but now I've waited ""so long"" to start trying for kids that due to my other health conditions (that pesky thing where my nerves are slowly frying themselves), my body can (most likely) no longer take the physical toll of carrying a child to term (yay!). Oh, and the real kicker? I got test results back this past Thursday that I'm not in early menopause afterall! So, now single and 9-months out from turning 30, I have until my 30th birthday to have whatever family is going to be genetically related to me, because if I put off treatment for the nerve condition any longer than that (once I start treatment I can't stop, and can't get/be pregnant whilst undergoing treatment, it's a dangerous and unhealthy combo), it's effectiveness is significantly reduced. According to my new (kick-ass) Drs, with my history of loss and other medical factors, it's likely that I would require medical intervention to keep a pregnancy to term and carry my own child, which even if I could afford and was ready to do (RIGHT NOW TODAY OR NEVARRR!), would also take a significant toll on my health (like I might be confined to a wheelchair and unable to make a living before I'm 40 kind of toll).

So, if you're still reading - I am doing my level best to come to terms with the hardest decision I've ever faced. I truly felt alone in this world (Everybody. Fucking. Every. Damn. Where. Is. Pregnant! Gaaaaahddd!) until I found this place. My family is great, but they dont really get it (and I can't really deal with more crying from mom about the grand babies she'll never get to rock). You, Strangers of the Interwebz, have legitimately been my lifeboat the past few weeks, more than you'll ever know. I'm working on finding a therapist, but I'm having trouble with the insurance/EAP program at work, so I'm trying to keep my sense of humour and my head above water until I can get leveled out or get help.

TL;DR: I appreciate your very existence.

I just went this morning to my RE to check my follicles on CD 12 after having taken clomid 50mg from CD 5-10. She said I have 4 follicles that are each about 17 or 18 (I'm not sure what this means exactly other than that this is what they want). However she said these are too many to do the insemination bc of the risk for multiples. Last month I had 3 follicles on CD 10 and had the insemination that month which didn't work. 

I was wondering if it would be bad to try and conceive naturally with my SO on my ovulation day. 

For some background we have been trying for 15 months. Last month was my first clomid assisted IUI. I had 1 Pregnancy that ended in MC about 9 months ago...I would have been due in 2 weeks :( .....  I also have a hypothyroid that is being treated and has been a normal level for about 2 months now. 

I hate to allow this month to pass me by especially when I know the probability of getting pregnant is generally is only about 20-30% anyway.

I'm a 33 year old female and my husband and I have been trying for almost 2 years. We were diagnosed MF after our first year. We've done one round of IVF without transferring and froze the one embryo we ended up with. I just completed our second round where we ended up with two semi compacted embryos. The embryologist suggested to transfer the better of the two along with the frozen, so that's what we did. I'm now 6dp5pt. So this is my first transfer. 

I have read so many posts of men and women at this for years and years. I admire everyone's determination. I don't know how you guys are so strong. I've been walking around all morning crying because I have no self control and took a pregnancy test knowing it would be inaccurate and if came back negative. I understand it's way too early but I couldn't help myself and I wish I hadn't done it. 

Also, I suffer from depression and anxiety and it's been a real doozie this round. I'm unmedicated for obvious reasons and it has been such a struggle. If this doesn't work, I don't know how many times more I can do this - especially since my yields have not been great. I think after this if it doesn't work I will need a couple of months off, but I feel like I have a ticking time bomb and any time off is time wasted. At the same time, I can only do 2 cycles a year for insurance/financial reasons so maybe a few months off will do me good.

Just got the call today, another IUI that didn't take. My wife had been telling me for the last few days she knew, told me she would be able to tell and she was sure. I think in the back of my mind I knew too. I just kept telling myself she could be wrong, we've never had so much as a scare so maybe the first time would, I don't know, sneak up on us. I know that's silly, but it's how I stayed sane the last week. 

This was only our second IUI, most likely our last. We're going to sit down after my wife gets home from work and talk about it. IVF is really not an option for us, I'm military and the wife is a pre-k teacher. The money factor could be over come but the stress and heartache is the real hangup. 

I've been doing so much thinking the last few months, I just get caught up in all the details. My wife is great in that regard, she is so fluid it's almost a fault. I know she wants the kid as bad as I do, but she's been joking about how maybe we're just meant to raise our fur-boys, they don't want to lose the attention. I, on the other hand, am kind of crushed inside. We stopped using condoms about 2 years ago, we did the standard ""We're no trying but..."" thing. Nothing happened for about a year. Last year we started trying hard, tracking cycles and using ovulation sticks. My job made it tough, as I travel a lot but we stayed on top of it. After another year of not even a late period, we started talking about getting tested. I've always been kind of self-conscious about the amount of semen I produced but I never thought it was a problem until that point. 

We got tested, my numbers came back ""Normal"" (which was a big relief for me) and my wife was a superstar on the tests we did. All signs pointed towards us having no issues. We did a month with her taking vitamins and ovulation sticks, but sex was only every three days and no ejaculation in-between. Nope. Then the first IUI. Nothing. I still remember where I was when my wife called to tell me she had a voicemail and wanted to know if she should wait for me or listen to it. I was traveling, so I told her to listen and call me back. It was beautiful day that had surprised us between the rainy, windy days that filled that week. My heart was racing, I tried to let the gentle breeze calm me down. I was expecting the worst but hoping for good news. When my phone buzzed, it was a text not a call; ""Nope"" followed closely by ""No big deal, next time"". I know she was upset and I wasn't even there when she probably needed me. Or maybe it was me that needed her then.

We regrouped quickly, said we'd do it again but this IUI is the one that got me. I remember the doctor saying just before the insemination that my sample was ""Good, 39 million swimmers"". I looked it up, 39Mil is the cut off for low sperm count. All my fears have resurfaced, what if all this really is on me? I've already uprooted her from her parents and hometown when we moved across the country, I leave her alone when I travel, and now I can't even give her the family we wanted. Not a good head space to be in.

I know she's not going anywhere, no worries there. I'm just getting it off my chest. We just wanted this to work out so badly (as you can all relate). We have childfree friends (by choice), we're the only couple on our street without kids and we love to babysit. We've watched people we know move into the neighborhood at 18/19 years old and get pregnant. We watch the parents around us complain about being cash-strapped when they have two new cars, a big ass tv, new guns, tools, and eat out every night. We're driving older cars, one paid off and the other close. When we started trying we started a new savings account ""For something in the future"", we both knew it was for baby expenses but didn't want to get ahead of ourselves. We both have older siblings that haven't had children yet and were so excited to give our parents the grandchild they've all wanted (only friendly pressure, they have been really great about staying out of our baby business).

I guess I'm just trying to handle the idea that we may end up childfree. I see that sub, I can appreciate some people don't want kids, but I don't fit in over there. I'm not ready to throw out the 'Baby box' we have hidden in the garage. After three stressful years, I started to feel like I was in some weird void all by myself. There were the 'Parents' and 'CF by choice', like everyone else had a choice and I was being dealt a card.

 I'm sorry for rambling. I haven't been able to bring myself to talk to anyone about it except my wife. I just wanted to share my grief with people who understood. Thank you for reading.

I finally saw an actual RE, the guy who started the practice, instead of the 22-year-old (looking) NP I'd had before. Just my routine u/s before my second letrozole cycle, but I asked about odds of success and when it was time to move on to IUIs.

He told me that at 36 after more than a year of trying, my odds were 5-6% per cycle with letrozole, and maybe an additional 1% with IUI, but probably only if we have MFI (we don't, as fast as we know - SA was good). I asked what other options there were between what we're doing now and IVF, and he said in theory we could do ""superovulation"" with stronger drugs, but they cancel IUIs with more than 3 follicles and don't recommend TI either because of the risk of multiples. I'm already making 3 follicles on letrozole. 

So, basically, up to 6% chance per cycle, or IVF, which we can't afford and there's no one in our family who could help either. 

I just feel like I'm never going to have a baby and it seems too soon for me to be feeling that way with no diagnosis and only going into my second month of treatment, but 95% chance of not having a baby every month is pretty fucking grim. 

And I feel so stupid, because they told me these numbers at the beginning and I naively thought that was on top of a ""baseline"" of 20%-ish that gets thrown around, not my TOTAL monthly odds after this much trying. 

Is this really what we are faced with? Are the odds really this bad if IVF is not an option financially?

<p>See y&#39;all there at 1:00PM; PM me for my cell number. I&#39;m so excited to meet y&#39;all!!!</p>

We've never tried to prevent pregnancy (because I was told it'd be very hard for me to get pregnant anyway as I rarely had a period) and I never got pregnant. We ""officially"" started trying right after we got married in 2013, but we have yet to be successful. Early last year my best friend and my husbands best friends wife got pregnant within one month of each other. Although I was ecstatic for them, I was also sad that I hadn't been able to be pregnant with my best friend like we had talked about doing all these years ago. Now I play Aunt to the baby and love her to death, but it's still a little bitter sweet.


In 2014 my regular gyno had me try 3 rounds of Clomid. She had assured me when I first started going to her (before we really knew any of my reproductive issues) that she would in fact get me pregnant, eventually. She didn't want to go past 3 rounds of clomid because of my family history, my mother dying of uterine cancer in 2007 at age 52, and my increased risk, so we stopped at 3 rounds. I took time off from trying in 2015 because I gained custody of my great niece when she was 2 years old, so I had a ton of refocusing and adjustment to do. Finally after putting my reproduction issues aside for almost 2 years I decided to start seeing a reproductive endocrinologist back in July 2016.


My new dr ended up doing a uterine ultrasound as well as a uterine biopsy because my lining was over 3x thicker than that of a normal uterine lining. My mother passed away from uterine cancer in 2007, so my doctor was understandably concerned with how things were going for me so he put me on Provera 10mg for 6 months and told me to follow up with a gynecologist/oncologist to see if the provera worked and where to go from there. (we switched insurance carriers and I went back to my regular gyno instead of the gyno/onc at 6 months) She ended up doing a hysteroscopy and a D&C this morning, also removing a few polyps she found, and sent everything to pathology. Hopefully it'll be good news.


It's just all so frustrating I'm having such a hard time, as I know the ladies of this subreddit understand. So far, outside of the initial Clomid, the other things done have been to try to get my uterus in normal working order before even trying additional fertility things. My gyno informed me that once I'm able to have a child, she'd like to go ahead and seriously consider a hysterectomy so we didn't have to worry about things progressing to a dangerous place again in the future.


To add to my frustrations, my 23 year old niece just found out she's pregnant for a THIRD time. She had her first child taken away by CPS, who I'm now raising, her second child was also taken away and is in foster care, and she is now talking about how she wants an abortion but can't afford it. It's so disheartening to hear these things! Sometimes I wonder why it's so easy for someone like her to get pregnant, 23, addicted to drugs and a wild, party, carefree, no-job lifestyle, but for someone like myself, almost 32, responsible, college educated, hard working and loving husband who provides for our family, I don't even know if I'll be able to keep my uterus, much less have a child of my own.


I've already told my husband that if I can't have my own child, I'd love to adopt and help (another) child in the system, but a little piece of me would still be lost knowing I couldn't look down on the child I made and see little things where they resemble me or my husband. Now, I've had people say ""why don't you not worry about having your own and just adopt, there are so many kids out there that already need help."" When I hear that, I understand what they mean but I also want to punch them in the face because it's like they don't understand I shouldn't feel bad for wanting my OWN child. I'm already (happily) raising a child that would have been in the system had I not taken her. How many more do I need to ""rescue"" before people stop guilt tripping me about wanting my own instead of adopting?


Anyway, just kind of ranting and throwing everything out there.

192,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Warning: This post mentions a previous IVF success and deals with going back for a second IVF cycle.

My husband and I have a very specific fertility issue where the sperm don't penetrate the egg. So IVF+ICSI is our only answer to having children. We are very lucky that it worked well the first time. We did a fresh transfer with one embryo, which resulted in a positive outcome. We had two embryos to freeze.

We signed up for the Attain program the first time. Our clinic only offers the option to do 3 fresh and 3 frozen cycles at a cost of about $28k. If you don't take home a baby, you get a refund. (Drugs and PGS are not included, $28k is just for the monitoring and clinic procedures.)

We did this the first time because we didn't know what to expect. We have to pay for IVF completely out of pocket so we technically ""overpaid"" by about $16k. That wasn't great, obviously, but we got what we wanted, so how can you be mad?

We originally were hoping to do an FET for our second. That's where we ran into problems. We decided to thaw, biopsy, and PGS our remaining two embryos. One did not survive the thaw. The other was abnormal (trisomy 16). So we lost them both. Back to IVF+ICSI we go. I start stims later this month.

My question: Knowing that we do well with IVF, should we do the Attain program again or not? It's an emotional trap, right? IVF is so shitty all around that you want any kind of guarantee. But if you need anything less than two fresh cycles and one frozen (doing some rough math), the ""house"" wins and you overpay. But that guarantee is there.

If you pay for anything out of pocket and it fails, that money is just gone.

My husband thinks it's dumb to pay extra for Attain again, since we know that IVF works well for us. I agree with him on the one hand, but on the other, what if we hit more issues? We thought we had two embryos to count on, only to end up with zero. Because what happened there, I'm beginning to think our success was a fluke. It worked out a little TOO well. Are we going to hit more issues? Nobody knows. That's the hell of this process.

I'm flinging around these figures like it's easy for us to spend an extra $16k. It's not. It would be a big blow if we sprung for Attain but ended up only needing one fresh cycle again, that we could've spent $12k on instead of $28k. But if that cycle fails, that $12k a la carte payment disappears with nothing to show for it, too.

Attain was an easy decision the first time because we didn't know what to expect. Now that we do, should we spring for it again just so there's not so much pressure on this first fresh cycle? I know you guys aren't me and don't have the same circumstances, but I'm at the end of my freaking rope thinking about this. What would YOU do if faced with this situation? Is that guarantee worth the potential extra investment? TIA!

N00b here. I have been reading all your posts and first let me say, you are all so incredible and this is a wonderful community. I’d like some advice. My husband and I have been TTC for a year now. I decided to go the gynecologist for some help and advice. My story goes back to when I was in High School. When I was a sophomore I missed my period for a whole year so we went to get that checked out. Thinking that I might have PCOS they did an ultra sound and everything came back normal, no PCOS and no other diagnosis. They gave me birth control and sent me on my way. I took it for 3 months and then I decided I was too lazy to take it plus I wasn’t sexually active so whatever. My cycles were completely normal after that (28-33 day cycles). Then after I got married I got back on birth control, then off again a year later. After birth control my periods were very irregular.  I would get them every other month. Sometimes they would be heavy, sometimes I would just have spotting. Sometimes I would cramp, sometimes I would not. It was just all over the place. I was also reading “Taking Charge of your Fertility” and I knew that I was not ovulating. I went to the doctor, hearing from friends that it would be easy, I would just need the Doc to give me clomid. So I went in. That day I had started my period. They did bloodwork and said to come back in 2 weeks. I went back 2 weeks later and I was still bleeding. The doc put me on the Eat to Live diet because everything was all out of whack, I have high cholesterol, triglycerides were high, HDLs low, vitamin d low, prolactin levels high(54). So he said, do this diet and come back in 2 months. And I had to remind that I was still bleeding and I was concerned about that. He gave me progesterone to help stop the bleeding, a week later I was still bleeding, I was bleeding harder than I have ever bled in my entire life. I went through 2 super tampon boxes in 2 weeks. And the progesterone did nothing. After a month of HEAVY bleeding I finally stopped. The doctor was concerned that I didn’t respond at all to the progesterone and he ordered another prolactin test and ultra sound. The ultrasound had tiny follicles but he said that those might just go away with the diet I was on. The prolactin test which came back high again (61). Now they want me to get an MRI. An MRI that is easy for them to ask for but I have to fork over $2100 for it. What if they don’t find anything wrong me!? And I just spent $2100 for a nice portrait of my brain.

TLDR: prolactin levels are high (54-61) Doc wants an MRI, I'm skeptical and I don't have $2100 lying around. No PCOS, Nothing on my ultrasound that was concerning. 

So my question is have any of you been through any of this? What was your experience? Is there anything I can do to naturally lower my prolactin levels? Since I just started this Eat to Live diet would it be worth it for me to wait a little while to see if this Diet will help my Prolactin levels?

Also, has anyone ever experienced a change in body odor with birth control? Cause I swear my birth control made my armpits smell terrible, I couldn’t even use deodorant because it would make it ten times worse. I had to resort to a natural deodorant from Lush and even with that by the end of the work day I was in need of a shower!

202,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I don't have my official protocol yet, but i talked to the nurse for a few minutes yesterday about meds.  I wanted to get a handle on costs because we're totally OOP (and I have a high deductible health plan that doesn't pay for anything until I meet the deductible- so even meds that are covered like estrogen will be OOP until I spend another $800 then co-pays kick in depending on the tier of med) and we're seriously very tapped out financially after IVF.  So I was a little bummed to hear from the nurse that I might be looking at about $1,000 worth of meds.  Is this normal?  


Here is what she said I'd need:



* bcp - have them and they are free anyway w/ insurance for 3 weeks-- starting tomorrow.



* Lupron 2 week kit which she said is about $500.  Is this real/accurate?  I looked on GoodRx and found that you can get the kit at Walmart (appears the same dose/strength) for $185.  Has anyone done this and not gone through a specialty pharmacy?  I'm planning to (because I have to do this financially...) go to Walmart this weekend and ask them about availability/process for getting this med since it's somewhat specialty.  Just wanted to see if anyone has been there done that with a retail pharmacy.



* Vivelle dots- nurse said these were ""quite expensive"" and I don't know how many I need.  What's common?  First of all I see there is a generic available- is the generic just as good?  It does not appear to be a TON cheaper, but every bit helps.   For an 8 count of the dots, GoodRX says I can get this at Walgreens for $38 (again, any experience with a retail pharmacy having this product in stock or being able to get it for you? - that's the generic)  My insurance says 90 for generic (8 dots) and 120 for brand name.   Another question on the patches- where do you place these on your body?  The nurse also said that insurance will sometimes cover this, but not at the doses they require so it will be out of pocket.  So that makes me think 8 dots is not going to last me a cycle


* Estrace oral tablets - I have these ""in stock"" at home from previous cycles and I know they are cheap even if I need to buy more.


* prometrium tablets (used vaginally)- I have these ""in stock"" also from previous months/my recent loss.  If I need more, I know there is a GoodRx coupon to get me a discount as my insurance seems to treat this med like some high tier specialty thing-- even the generic version.


* Crinone gel- this was the big one I was not expecting. (why both crinone and prometrium tabs)  I assumed PIO which is expensive too, but cheaper I think- this is like $20 a day no?  I see a $150 off or $15 total copay coupon online that I will try my best to use with my insurance (with insurance it's supposed to be only $15 and it seems like my insurance will cover this-- any experience with insurance covering it when they don't cover any infertility stuff?)  And I suppose if I need to drop $500 on this stuff, it will at least go against my deductible if I can use a network pharmacy.   Any experience getting this one off the shelf/ordered through a local retail pharmacy or do you need to go mail order specialty?


* steroid, antibiotic, etc.  - insurance should cover this, but I know doxycycline is used and I was on that for sinus infection- that is not cheap (when you have the type of prescription plan I have-- I had to use a GoodRx coupon for that too)



Sorry for all the maybe lame/newbie questions.  With IVF meds (and I did injectables in the past), it was always straight forward -- had to get them at mail order places. Now it seems like I have more choice and I want to find the best cost savings I can.  The nurse took total control of my IVF scripts and I now have like $1,000 worth of meds sitting in my cabinet at home because she didn't account for overfill (I would have ordered less and assumed overfill...reordered if needed) and she gave me no chance to shop around for prices- now granted I had literally 2 days to order/get my meds but they did the same thing with my IUI meds and I had to ask them to NOT send things without allowing me to pick the pharmacy because I had First Steps/Compassionate Care discounts that some places did not take.",[],False,,0,False,FET Protocol/Meds Questions,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_5y9wt4,False,dark,0.8,,public,3,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,,False,False,,{},,False,3,,self,,1489000547.0,,{},,True,,1489029116.0,text,0,,,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I don&#39;t have my official protocol yet, but i talked to the nurse for a few minutes yesterday about meds.

I am 41 and have been struggling since age 36. We tried half assedly for a year and then seriously for another 8 months until a dr visit revealed a large mass on my ovary.  They thought it was the big c so immediately operated and it was a Dermoid and a big mess of endo (stage 4 endo). Healed from that and tried 3 months and straight to ivf where I did three cycles over the next year and failed all. Did not even make it to retrieval as I would barely respond to meds.  

Then we made the decision to do donor egg (husband has no issues) and waited a year for a donor to become available. (Big NYC clinic). This was actually not terrible as I was able to recover mentally and grieve the loss. By the time we got the donor I was ready! She is perfect and is very similar to me in appearance and some other traits.  We do the process and I end up failing that too. We have 7 embryos frozen so that's great - the donor was a rockstar and so was my husband. It's just me. First the lining wasn't triple striped then the dr saw little pockets or cysts in my lining so he cancelled me. Dr did try to aspirate but he still didn't like how it looked.  He says this just happens but I am wondering wtf because I had a mock cycle 8 months ago that was fine and a normal saline sonogram right at the beginning of the cycle. 

They are inducing a period and doing another saline sono after that and if that is okay we try again with me. It also always seemed my estrogen was never building up fast enough despite the patches. And towards the end my progesterone was low. And my thyroid is borderline at 2.5. All these issues I didn't know I had. 

I am very upset because I was sold on donor as a slam dunk and my stupid body failed the ""easy"" part. Has anyone had a bad lining and then was ok for the next cycle? I am worried this is something bad but my dr says it's not cancer etc.  

Could stress affect it? I have an ill family member and there was a lot of stress and sleepless nights around that. My nurse said there is nothing I did to cause this but I wonder.  I also had wine a few times. If I am allowed to proceed I will not do that and will eat better, do more yoga and accupuncture. Does anyone have any other suggestions for what I could do to help this along?

I give some background info below and I've tried poring through past posts because I don't doubt this has been asked before, BUT, basically what I'm wondering is: 

- Do you have info or research articles that speak about infertility bloodwork results that you can recommend? Cold Dr. Googling has certainly pointed me to a number of sites, but now I'm encountering so much conflicting information (I know already that ""assays"" or numbers are different so not just conflicting information about exact numbers of results). In other words, I'm looking to understand the results of my tests on my own to a degree, since I've read that different REs have different attitudes about these results. I have results for CD3 estradiol and FSH, AMH (I took it on CD3), and also 7DPO progesterone. 

- How did you decide on choosing an RE or infertility clinic? I may have one approved to me through my insurance, but I know my insurance only covers some things (and nothing to do with IVF) so I'm wondering if it isn't better to make a choice about the ""best"" in the area for us over the ""only one in my plan"" if much of what they do won't be covered anyway. 

My ob/gyn is a very lovely person but also very much in the ""just keep trying"" category and that time has passed frankly. The little I'm aware of IVF is that when I turn 38 I'm in a different statistical category. So she finally ordered bloodwork for me and offered to schedule a HSG. I've got the results for the first batch and just did the 7DPO today. Once these are complete she said depending on whatever they reveal she can refer me to a RE. 

I have no doubt these questions have been discussed before so I'll keep searching  by terms as well, but any links or thoughts are appreciated. 

I never used Reddit before going down this spiral that is ""TTC"" and my thanks and gratitude for its existence is huge. A full confession: two years ago I was that a**hole googling stuff about TTC and rolling my eyes at ""those women"" on sites like the Bump thinking ""I'll never be like that.""

218,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello my lovely barren bitches,

I'm not around here as much anymore for many reasons. Between work, nearing the end of our infertility treatment options, the end of our money and longing for the end of our heartache, I need to move on. Or, at least start weaning myself away. I've needed to start distancing myself from this place to focus on my future, my career and my marriage. No one can stay here forever, but not everyone moves on with a baby.

As I look to a likely child-free future, as I sit with all of that hurt and fear, I'm longing for perspective. We have one more IVF cycle planned, but today, for the 3rd month in a row, I've been benched for a cyst. 

I went of Facebook to wish my nephew a happy birthday, and I saw a post that angered me at the world. I have a cousin who is 42 and dying of pancreatic cancer. She's stopped chemo and is spending time with her family (she's my cousins wife, but in my family, that makes us primas). She's been fighting this disease for over 2 years, and she is out of options. She has a 12yo son and a husband along with siblings and parents and grandparents. 

Someone, I'm not sure who, posted on her wall about a juice people can make at home that cures cancer in 2 days. If the bingoes we receive about standing on our heads and eating pineapple feel like hand grenades, that post must have felt like a nuclear bomb. 

I'm not here to diminish your pain in anyway or to say ""at least we're not dying"" because I know the pain is real, and sometimes, death doesn't seem so bad. But can you imagine the pain my cousin and her family feel reading stupid things like this? She's facing her mortality and everyone is having to come to terms with loosing her knowing there's nothing that can be done and then some person posts the most hurtful and ignorant bullshit.

We all know the person who would do this. This person is ignorant, this person is insensitive, this person probably doesn't vaccinate, this person judges you and your non-organic cheddar cheese, this person has never felt the pain of infertility or death, this person distrusts modern medicine/science, this person has said you need to find organic IVF meds, this person said you need to be gluten free, this person told you to adopt one of those free and perfect needy babies they heard about someplace. This person is a virus degrading our humanity.

**EDIT** Whoa guys! I didn't think this post would be given so much attention, but it *is* a topic we deal with so often. I wish I didn't have this huge deadline at work, or I'd be more involved in the conversations going on here. You guys are all wise beyond your years.

But can you imagine the pain my cousin and her family feel reading stupid things like this? She&#39;s facing her mortality and everyone is having to come to terms with loosing her knowing there&#39;s nothing that can be done and then some person posts the most hurtful and ignorant bullshit.</p>

<p>We all know the person who would do this. This person is ignorant, this person is insensitive, this person probably doesn&#39;t vaccinate, this person judges you and your non-organic cheddar cheese, this person has never felt the pain of infertility or death, this person distrusts modern medicine/science, this person has said you need to find organic IVF meds, this person said you need to be gluten free, this person told you to adopt one of those free and perfect needy babies they heard about someplace. This person is a virus degrading our humanity.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Whoa guys! I didn&#39;t think this post would be given so much attention, but it <em>is</em> a topic we deal with so often. I wish I didn&#39;t have this huge deadline at work, or I&#39;d be more involved in the conversations going on here. You guys are all wise beyond your years. Thank you so much for the words of affirmation and comfort. Y&#39;all really are the best. <strong>ALSO</strong> my RE determined my cyst was so small that we could proceed with the cycle as planned! I started my stims last night!</p>

My story starts when I was 16 and got my first surgery and an emergency surgery to remove a massive cyst and got my PCOS diagnosis. Many cysts, ruptures, miscarriages, and years of hoping that maybe one day I'll be able to have my own child, I was able to conceive my daughter naturally. My pregnancy however was extremely complicated and I had tons of health complications and I ended up with an emergency c-section but my daughter and I were both happy and healthy. Like anyone else, I had my fair share of issues; family drama, financial strains - I basically had my own shit going on before. And then my daughter suddenly passed away and I wanted to die with her. My life turned upside down and hasn't turned right side up since. I couldn't fathom how a perfectly healthy, gorgeous 3 month baby girl just all the sudden was gone? Come to find out, my cesarean was botched, and I just had surgery to remove more cysts and adhesions, Endo. Remove my organs from each other and untangle my tubes. Only to prove how much of a miracle that she was, that is constantly so hard and I lost her? And 

Well, I started to learn a few things very fast. And I want to address these. 1. After going through other losses, like a miscarriage, I was able to survive those through the privacy of it. I was able to go about my day without feeling like the world viewed me as a failure. I learned the second that you lose a previously healthy, living child, everyone assumes the worst. And they are instantly unable to give you any support in your grieving process and they're unable to recognize the insensitivity in their curiosity. I have many co-workers or friends who have suffered other losses, like a miscarriage or still birth and I can't help but become enraged. Not at them directly, I should clarify. But at the support they receive, like they're more deserving because they're less likely to have been the cause? Suddenly everyone you know becomes a detective and wants to know every detail of your life. And the reality of it is, SIDS is so incomprehensible that I get it's easier to have a reason. But it's disgusting that they always assume the worst.
2. People always ask you to support others. This morning I lost it because a co-worker of mine who is recently pregnant contacted me about a charity that she is started for a friend of hers. (How sweet). Except her friend has PCOS and Endo and can't conceive. Well, I can relate. I feel for this girl. But honestly. I'm still paying my daughter's medical bills from her dying and I'm trying to have my own baby and will probably need to pay for my own IVF. WHY ARE PEOPLE BEGGING ME FOR MONEY? No one wanted to raise money for my daughter's medical expenses or my fertility treatment. But they think I'm the best person to message and ask for money?

It's these things I find you can't find an article on Google about to help you relate and feel like someone knows what you're going through. Or even on here. I've never felt so alone in my life. All I want is another child. Not even as a replacement. Just to prove to myself I can do it, my body can do it. And lightening won't strike twice so I don't live in fear. My husband says he isn't ready. And that upsets me because I want one like yesterday. It's so hard. 

Edit: I know this sub may not be the best one, but I was hoping I would find more people who would relate than posting in grief. I feel like I need to find more like-minded people, rather than bonding over death? I don't mean to sound insensitive if that's how I come off.

We haven't even started and I've resorted to the odd nicotine gum to prevent myself from re-taking up the horrible smoking addiction I kicked years ago, because in light of our fertility problems, the urge came back with vengeance. 

I want to go into this armed with life-pro tips on NOT letting the ruminating get to me. How have you guys managed to keep the anxiety beast at bay?

**EDIT:**
Thanks SO much everyone! The ideas are so great and helpful! I have brainstormed activities to force myself to engage in when I'm tempted to freak out:

- Rounded up Harry Potter books 1-7 – haven't read them in years and years and now is a good a time as any to revisit
- Signed up for salsa dancing lessons with my husband (we've always wanted to)
- Looking into a weekend trip to Prague to visit friends (though visiting the beer capital of the world without drinking is going to be a BIT of a challenge)
- Going to revisit my coloring books (love listening to podcasts while doing so)
- Definitely going to try and keep a tidy house – something I'm woefully bad at. Maybe give the maid a two week vacation

<p>Every month when my wife, approaching 40, gets her periods, she comes closer to menopause... And with that, the certainty that we will live this life without our own children.</p>

<p>It is a profound sadness and we have no idea what to do.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. Hoping for peace in your own lives.</p>

Tired of hoping and crying and praying and bargaining.
God...just so tired of everything.
We have been trying to conceive for a little over a year now and I swear I can just feel it in my bones that this is just the start. I have a horrible feeling about our infertility. I feel like this feeling is going to last forever. 

Everywhere around me people are pregnant and happy with their cute babies. Me... I smile while trying to beat the envious feelings inside of me. I'm so mad and so sad. 

I can feel my hope slowly dying and what a painful and gut wrenching death it is. 

On the 16th I have an appointment with my OB. I already know that I have hypothyroidism and I'm taking medication for that. But on the 16th my infertility testing starts. I am so scared of what the results are going to say. I am a mess waiting for the 16th and I'm a mess typing this up.

(1) Background: Medical interventions including assisted reproductive technologies have improved fertility outcomes for many sub-fertile couples. Increasing research interest has investigated the effect of low carbohydrate diets, with or without energy restriction. We aimed to systematically review the published literature to determine the extent to which low carbohydrate diets can affect fertility outcomes; 

(2) Methods: The review protocol was registered prospectively with Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (registration number CRD42016042669) and followed Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Infertile women were the population of interest, the intervention was low carbohydrate diets (less than 45% total energy from carbohydrates), compared to usual diet (with or without co-treatments). Four databases were searched from date of commencement until April 2016; a supplementary Google scholar search was also undertaken. Title and abstract, then full text review, were undertaken independently and in duplicate. Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were checked to ensure that all relevant studies were identified for inclusion. Quality assessment was undertaken independently by both authors using the Quality Criteria Checklist for Primary Research. Outcome measures were improved fertility outcomes defined by an improvement in reproductive hormones, ovulation rates and/or pregnancy rates;

 (3) Results: Seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the evidence synthesis. Interventions were diverse and included a combination of low carbohydrate diets with energy deficit or other co-treatments. Study quality was rated as positive for six studies, suggesting a low risk of bias, with one study rated as neutral. Of the six studies which reported changes in reproductive hormones, five reported significant improvements post intervention; 

(4) Conclusion: The findings of these studies suggest that low carbohydrate diets warrant further research to determine their effect. These randomised controlled trials should consider the effect of carbohydrates (with or without energy deficit) on hormonal and fertility outcomes.

I have undergone 1 IUI (only to be told afterwards by a specialist that IUI's rarely work), and 3 Ivf's - all failed. I have tried everything from specialists, witch doctors, religions (plural because I have visited several places of worship), visiting different countries, miracle cures, old wives tales, everything. I was once told that having a pet would ease any stress I had and that several people fall pregnant after owning animals. I bought a dog - he is fabulous and the love of our life, but he turns 3 in June. I was told that if I make myself busy with work and study that it would be too ""inconvenient"" for me to have a child and therefore the universe would allow me to be pregnant. I am now half way through my law degree, work full-time in a law firm and own a restaurant with my lovely husband. ""Go on a holiday, you will fall pregnant then"". I have been to 17 countries on holiday since I first started trying. Nothing seems to work.

I have ""unexplained infertility"", my husband has above average sperm count and is healthy, I have above average fertility and viable eggs. I do have PCOS but it is well managed with fertility treatment.

I don't have any questions, I just need to talk. 

I'm from a small regional town in Australia where it seems everyone is easily able to conceive. Although I don't have bitter feelings toward those that are lucky enough to have children first go, I am bitter that I have no one to relate to or that can understand my frustration. I do have an amazing husband, but as anyone who has been through this situation can understand, it isn't that productive to continuously burden the other person in the situation with how you feel when you are both supposed to be staying positive. 

For several years, when I try to discuss how I feel with others, I am constantly told ""don't stress you are so young"" or ""it's just not in God's plan right now"". What? I may have been young 4 years ago but look how fast that went. Will it ever be in his plan?

I have gone through my entire life with a fine tooth comb to try and see what I did wrong that could equate to me not being good enough to have children. I have only ever wanted to be a mother.

I just spent the last 7 months without fertility treatment trying to repair the damage done by my last 3 Ivf's. Next week I undergo a partial mastectomy of my right breast to remove a tumour that suddenly appeared a few months ago. I am slowly regaining my memory and am increasing my sleep at night. I just started losing some of the 18.5kgs I gained in the 3 months after ceasing treatment in August 2016 due to hormone changes.

I am struggling with this idea that maybe I'm not destined to have my own biological children, but then another mind says ""that's bs, you will be a mother"". I just wish someone could give me a definite answer so I know whether to keep pushing on with treatment (negatively impacting my physical/mental state) or to call it quits and invest in adoption. 

I looked into adoption recently, it is currently a 6 year wait. It's takes 2 years to be approved. I need to have stopped fertility treatment prior to this. 

But to me, stopping treatment is that same as giving up. And I can't give up in my children. I can't. 

I have a friend who suggested she would be happy to be a surrogate, but my state surrogate laws force that I sign a statutory declaration stating that I will cease trying to conceive and then a surrogate can come to play. I can't sign that. It would be a lie. 

What do I do? How do I move on? How do I stay sane? I'm scared. I'm scared of what last year's treatment did to me. But I'm even more scared of what not having children will do to me. My husband is a great guy, but every human has a limit on disappointment. What is in our future. I'm so scared.

I used the work employee assistance program (therapy) and met with a pretty good therapist about three times to work out my feelings about all of it. 

I mentioned my own struggle with IF in one of the sessions, but it was not a focal point. At my final session, the T wanted to discuss a little more about my IF with the possibility of meeting for more sessions in the future. I was game, although my husband and I have already resolved not to move forward with IVF. I expressed to the T that we continue to hope we may one day get pregnant without intervention, but if not, that's okay, too.

I told the T that obviously, it's a little sad not having kids and we don't wish to adopt at this point. I have some anxiety about how awful my own mother was, as well. At this point, the T took it upon herself to start pointing out ways I can ""practice"" mothering and work with kids. She suggested volunteering at a local home for young mothers with babies or coaching little league at a local park. 

Mind you, I used to teach and coach in public schools for ten years, and I TOLD her this. It's noble work to volunteer, but I'm tired of taking care of other people's kids. I wanted my own and I've been dealing with the probability it won't happen since my diagnosis, for almost a year now. 

I'm so sick of hearing and reading about people who think it's the job of those who are IF to volunteer and help the rest of the world all the time. Once you point out how hard it is to adopt, they say, ""Well you can just foster a kid"" without the understanding that the point of foster care is to reunite families. It's as though they think IF women have some pent up ""mothering energy"" and we're being just plain selfish for not using it on other people's kids.

Please understand, I know foster care is important for kids; my parents fostered a troubled teen for a time when I was young. I'm not knocking people who volunteer and I know it can be fulfilling because I have done it, myself, many times. But, it's not what I want to do at this moment and it has nothing to do alleviating my sadness about IF! I wish people would stop making this link!

I posted earlier about an abnormal semen analysis that only had issues with morphology. To update everyone - my urologist & my wife's OB both think it's no big deal because I had so much sperm that it should compensate for more abnormal forms. 

Anyways - now my wife went in to start her testing. She had normal hormones on her 3rd day of her period. But it was incidentally noted that she has lost 10 lbs in the last year and had hyperthyroidism.

She just did a thyroid scan and it shows likely Graves disease. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Her OB/endocrinologist seems to think this could be causing our difficulty conceiving (24 months). 

Just curious what avenue people took if they had a diagnosis of Graves while trying to conceive (radioactive iodine, vs medication, vs surgery) and how effective it was/wasn't.

I guess I'm feeling a little.....I dunno......not bummed because hopefully this'll be the help we need, but I guess slightly dejected maybe? More along the lines of feeling like I never knew this would be the path I'd have to take to get effing knocked up. 

If 16-year old me knew how hard this would be I would've been less terrified of that boy getting me pregnant because I used his bath towel after him. And what if he had semen on that towel (I didn't even imagine *how* said semen got there) and let me go ask my mother if you can get knocked up from dried sperm contact! 

We started trying in May 2015 after our wedding and I remember the first few months after that I was so optimistic. I was constantly in a state of, ""I am SO pregnant right now because I feel slightly nauseous. Way knocked up."" When we finally did get pregnant last February I was elated, obviously, and the thought that we'd have a miscarriage never occurred to me since I was under the illusion that it was way more rare than it actually is. I was the one on message boards and forums calming the nerves of the other panicky women...assuring them that they were fine and their baby would be fine. And then on our first ultrasound I became that panicky woman. 

I started Clomid back in October around my 32nd Birthday. The first month I had some decent follicles, but nothing worth writing home over. Month two was a dud. At my Day 12 Follicle check they just looked like little grapes. Month three and four weren't really notable aside from month fours addition of trigger shot + IUI. We took a break in January just because emotionally I'm so sick of getting amped to just feel let down over and over and over and over. 

On Monday I had my Day 3 FSH blood work done -- My Progesterone was <0.2. My Estradiol was 56.9 and my FSH was 7.9 -- all in the normal ranges for their perspective values. Wednesday we went back and I had an HSG done. Let me just say I'm slightly glad I didn't Google ahead of time for that one because holy shit balls was that the worst pain I've yet to experience in my life, and that comes from knowing the pain of a ruptured appendix, broken bones and having my skull sawed open (Mastoidectomy). That shit was real. But, results came back a-ok. 

Today was my Day 11 (I typically go on Day 12 but after my HSG and seeing I had some 14mm follicles they decided today was okay to check) and my first month on Femara. I seem to have a better response to this than the Clomid as I had one that was almost 20mm. Fingers crossed I suppose?

I guess what just keeps grating my gears is that I have no reason for any of this - and I know that falls under ""unexplained infertility"" but in my whole life nothing suggested I'd have a hard time. My mother? Psssshhh. Woman has had 15 surgeries for PCOS and just the worst gynecological history of anybody I know and she had my brother and me. I have no ""issues"" with my period and I haven't since I first got it when I was 12 years old. Clockwork. Everything runs the way it should....

So how did y'all get to the point of accepting that it is what it is? That you have no answers or reasons and that resonates as ""okay""?

I guess I&#39;m feeling a little.....I dunno......not bummed because hopefully this&#39;ll be the help we need, but I guess slightly dejected maybe? More along the lines of feeling like I never knew this would be the path I&#39;d have to take to get effing knocked up. </p>

<p>If 16-year old me knew how hard this would be I would&#39;ve been less terrified of that boy getting me pregnant because I used his bath towel after him. And what if he had semen on that towel (I didn&#39;t even imagine <em>how</em> said semen got there) and let me go ask my mother if you can get knocked up from dried sperm contact! </p>

<p>We started trying in May 2015 after our wedding and I remember the first few months after that I was so optimistic. I was constantly in a state of, &quot;I am SO pregnant right now because I feel slightly nauseous. Way knocked up.&quot; When we finally did get pregnant last February I was elated, obviously, and the thought that we&#39;d have a miscarriage never occurred to me since I was under the illusion that it was way more rare than it actually is. I was the one on message boards and forums calming the nerves of the other panicky women...assuring them that they were fine and their baby would be fine. And then on our first ultrasound I became that panicky woman. </p>

<p>I started Clomid back in October around my 32nd Birthday. The first month I had some decent follicles, but nothing worth writing home over. Month two was a dud. At my Day 12 Follicle check they just looked like little grapes. Month three and four weren&#39;t really notable aside from month fours addition of trigger shot + IUI. We took a break in January just because emotionally I&#39;m so sick of getting amped to just feel let down over and over and over and over. </p>

My wife and I have struggled with infertility, and as a way to support others who are also sharing that struggle, we've started working with a foundation that provides grants for infertility costs to people in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Missouri.

The Kevin J. Lederer Life foundation provides grants of up to $10,000 to individuals who need financial assistance to aid with services such as third party reproduction, adoption, or medical costs associated with IVF or other infertility procedures. They also directly donate IVF cycles from partner practices in Illinois.

**Last year they were able to award 14 grants valued at over $140,000.**

I'm not an official representative of the foundation. My wife and I donated to the foundation, and then reached out to them to see if they needed additional help, which is why I'm trying to spread the word. 

If you live in the four states mentioned and need financial assistance, whether or not you have insurance coverage, please check out their website and submit a grant application next month. Alternatively, if you have the desire to give back and support a good cause and want to donate time or money, they could use your help. All of the staff positions are unpaid as their focus is giving out as much of their donated funds to grant recipients as possible. I know they are looking for a volunteer social media person to assist them.

They also have a 2017 Run for Life 5k run/walk taking place in Glenview, IL in September for those in the Chicago area.

On **Tuesday, March 6 at 4 pm PT**, it is our privilege to host an **AMA with Dr. Alan Horsager from Episona and Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh** on using epigenetics while going through infertility treatment.


Episona, a molecular diagnostics company based in Los Angeles, is pleased to announce a newly developed method of diagnosing male fertility by measuring epigenetic changes in sperm DNA. This study was published in the peer-reviewed journal, Fertility & Sterility (http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)01865-8/abstract).

**WHO IS DR. HORSAGER AND DR. AIMEE EYVAZZADEH?**
Dr. Alan Horsager is currently the President & CEO of Episona, an epigenetic data company focused in men’s reproductive health. Most recently, he was a Founder and Chief Science Officer of Eos Neuroscience, a company that continues to engineer optogenetic gene therapies for blindness and chronic pain. Alan received his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Southern California where he currently is a visiting Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Ophthalmology. He has numerous scientific publications and issued patents, and has received several career awards including the Burroughs Wellcome Fund CASI award.

Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, also known as the “Egg Whisperer,"" is one of America’s most famous Fertility Doctors. Her success rate at baby-making gives future parents hope when nothing else has worked. She’s had a hand in creating thousands of happy healthy babies. Dr. Aimee is a Harvard-educated board certiﬁed OBGYN, specializing in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility; but she is best known for her Egg Freezing Parties. Her goal is to teach everyone about fertility awareness and how to #GetAheadOfInfertility. She has been featured in magazines like People and Marie Claire, and has been featured on the Today Show, Good Morning America, CBS Morning, and Fox Network.  In her off-time, Dr. Aimee is a Mom to four rambunctious young kids age 9 to 8 months.

*Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh has no role at Episona. She uses Episona’s Seed Fertility Test in her practice.



**AMA FOCUS OF DISCUSSION**
Measuring a man’s fertility has relied on the semen analysis for over 50 years. Is this enough today? Or do the incredible advances in epigenomic medicine offer us a better way to predict male fertility potential? We encourage participation from anyone wanting to know more about epigenetics and how it can help us better understand and diagnose male infertility. We look forward to discussing how this can help you and your doctor decide on the best fertility treatments. We also welcome discussion about how environmental factors and lifestyle (smoking, etc.) can affect your sperm epigenome. You can visit this link for an overview of epigenetics: https://www.episona.com/learn/


Episona is currently conducting the validation study on a large population with world renowned fertility clinics like: SCRC, RMANJ, CCRM, CCRMT, FCSA, MINN…etc.


**Dr. Horsager will share a sample test result on Monday and discuss it with us. We'll add that link in the edit here where it's ready.**



**PARTICIPATION IN THE AMA**
We encourage anyone with interest in the epigenetics testing used to understand and diagnose male infertility to come along on Monday, March 6th and participate. If you can't make it, please reply to this post with your question or message the mods and we will make sure it's included in the AMA. If you see a question you would like to see answered please upvote it.

She's probably ten years older but we have a lot in common; she has/had sever endo and had trouble falling pregnant with her daughter but ended up conceiving naturally and it came up in conversation that I'm going through my own stuff. Every time I go in she asks how it's going and what my treatments are like and I happily chat with her about it, because I don't meet many women who can relate and its kind of nice to share our experiences. I feel the need to mention this part because it might explain why she felt like we could speak as frankly as she did.

A couple months ago during my last appointment she was asking a bunch of questions about IVF. It came to the question about how many embryos I was going to implant vs. freeze and what my plans were for the remaining embryos which we would never end up using. Knowing she's full blown catholic, I delicately tried to explain to her that I wasn't religious and didn't believe that it was causing harm to my unborn embryos or their potential souls to be frozen indefinitely or destroyed. I said I absolutely don't want twins so I'll take the chance that the procedure doesn't work over the potential to resent the existence of one of my own children. 

The conversation deteriorates into her unleashing a diatribe about everything from religion to welfare to Donald Trump, abortion, adoption, you name it. Everything your mother always told you to avoid in mixed company, we're talking about it now. ALL OF THIS WHILE I'M ON MY KNEES WITH MY BARE ASS HANGING OUT AND HER RIPPING OUT MY PUBES!

Don't get me wrong, much of what she had to say I could understand and even agree with and I felt like I kept up with the conversation just fine. We have a lot of similar viewpoints about the state of affairs in the world, and she really is a nice lady. Now, I don't know if it was just my own perception or what, but it felt like she started getting aggro about the embryo thing specifically and I really felt judged. Her body language changed and I swear she started ripping out hair harder! I was nearly in tears by the time I left. Here I am, going through the most difficult time in my life, sitting in the most vulnerable physical position possible, and I feel like I'm being tortured and judged by a crazy lady! I felt myself shut down and go into zombie mode, I paid my bill and left. I'm not great at standing up for myself in the heat of the moment. I just go limp and try to extricate myself as quickly as possible. So, I drove home and bitched to my husband and all of my friends and thought that was the end of it. She was fired. I was done. Never going back. Not saying boo. Easy.

Then yesterday out of the blue she sends a smiley email saying she was thinking of me and asking how I'm doing. I was shocked! I really hoped to just forget about each other and go our separate ways, but apparently the exchange wasn't as aggressive as I perceived it to be. Half of me wants to continue to ignore the email. The other half feels like I owe her an explanation, even if its just to enlighten her on not being an asshole around her clients. The problem is, every time I start an email to her in my head it ends one of two ways. A. I roll over and show her my yellow belly, wind up apologizing for something I didn't do, end up scheduling my next appointment because I'm a pacifist or B. Unleash a tirade of frothing hormonal rage and end up threatening to burn her house down.

How do I kindly tell her how I feel without being mean but also stand up for myself and other women in my position.
