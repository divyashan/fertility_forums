I’m turning 26 in a few days. My wife and I have been married for a little over 6 years. We dated off and on high school, then a bit after, and I knew I couldn’t live without her. We talked about kids when we were engaged. We wanted to get some school out of the way first, but the plan was to have a kid last year. We stopped being careful about two years ago, then got serious last year. Turns out she probably has PCOS. There wasn’t an official diagnosis, but she has most/all the symptoms and poly cysts on her ovaries. We think she had an very early miscarriage a few months ago too. A late, unusually heavy period with some solid something in the mix. 

Being off birth control also has its downfalls. My wife gets terrible acne. Large, painful cysts, massive breakouts. The whole 9 yards. The best course of action at this point is a medication that requires a 6 month commitment and a signed disclosure to use 2 forms of birth control. 

I’m worried I might also have some infertility issues, but I don’t think I can handle getting tested. At least now I can just suspect everything’s fine. If I am infertile?

We can’t afford adoption, which I wouldn’t mind, but I don’t think my wife is really that enthusiastic about it anyway. IFV may be an option, but I’m not sure that’s financially feasible either. We have some money set aside in an HSA, and our health insurance is pretty decent as far as pregnancy goes. 

All in all, I’m not where I expected to be at this point in life. Work, school, family all seem to have taken detours I couldn’t expect. Some are my fault, others were beyond control. I just needed to tell someone who isn’t going to stress over it or try to “fix” it.

Update: In the last 13 months a lot has changed. I don’t know if anyone will see this, but I still thought an update was in order. I quit the job I hated, and started working a construction job for a guy who’s now one of my best friends. We took a break from trying while my wife took Acutane and it really cleared up the acne.

I’m not at risk of OHSS as I am getting better but by degrees.  I’m also having ups and downs (I.e., wake up feeling better, go to sleep feeling blech).

I knew I’d only do one egg retrieval and I honestly have no idea how so many of you have been through multiple.  I don’t see myself doing this again and the discomfort I’ve had since Wednesday isn’t making a good case for a second round.

I feel like my lower abdomen is distended (worse than bloated) and my stomach FEELS like it’s full of gas but it’s really not.  It’s just tightly uncomfortable.

It’s a relief to pee because it’s like I’m making more room.  

I talked to the embryologist today and he explained that when they poke each fibroid and suction the eggs out, they actually all fill back up with fluid and the whole area becomes swollen and agitated (yay me).  

Today was day 3 and out of 17 eggs, the 11 that fertilized normally (3 more looked abnormal), all were still hanging in there.  Of the three weirdos, one self destructed.  So, in total I have 13 but really, I’m only paying attention to the 11.

I find out Monday how many they’ll biopsy for PGS.

<p>I talked to the embryologist today and he explained that when they poke each fibroid and suction the eggs out, they actually all fill back up with fluid and the whole area becomes swollen and agitated (yay me).  </p>

<p>Today was day 3 and out of 17 eggs, the 11 that fertilized normally (3 more looked abnormal), all were still hanging in there.  Of the three weirdos, one self destructed.  So, in total I have 13 but really, I’m only paying attention to the 11.</p>

<p>I find out Monday how many they’ll biopsy for PGS.</p>

<p>I’m going to drink SOOOO many fluids tomorrow and I’m not leaving my couch.</p>

He said “don’t worry, it won’t hurt,” but I know from here that is not always true.

For reference, my IUD insertion was excruciating and my first HSG attempt failed because the radiologist couldn’t get through my cervical opening and the second time (with RE) required manual dilation. 

So, I’ve read that a lot of clinics give Valium or Ativan pre-transfer, but I guess mine doesn’t. But I do have some Klonopin that was prescribed for me for anxiety before my second HSG attempt. I’m wondering if it’s safe to take it, since it’s also a benzo. 

Anyone have experience with this? Obviously it would be ideal to have Valium or Ativan, because I know those are prescribed for this, but is Klonopin close enough?

Obviously I know none of you can give me an actual medical opinion, but I’d still like your thoughts / experience if you don’t mind. And if any of you have a general understanding of the difference between the benzos, that could be helpful, too.

Thanks!

Thanks for being awesome- I feel like I've gotten so much from this community already. We got a second opinion from a new clinic this morning and I can't seem to find good info about this approach... anyone else done an IVF cycle where you started BCP during the mid-luteal phase (5-6 days post ovulation), followed by an antagonist protocol? 

Some context and a brief history: me 33, husband 36, trying for two years. We both work in scientific / clinical fields and I've spent a lot of time trying to get as clinically savvy about IVF as I am for work- tougher than I thought it would be. Our primary diagnosis is MFI (low counts ~5M, low morphology) and to date, my tests have come back normal (AMH 2, FSH 6.8, clear HSG) though my AFC has generally been a bit low for what would be expected (10 - 14). Due to MFI we went straight to IVF + ICSI. 

IVF cycle #1 (Aug 2017) - long lupron, including BCP.  Was oversuppressed and had dominant follicles emerge- would have had a max of 5 eggs retrieved and our RE was convinced we could do better and recommended cancelling. We did. 

IVF cycle #2 (Nov 2017) - natural start, antagonist protocol (gonal-f 300 / menopur 150). Did much better but probably overstimulated. Already had a lead follicle at 16mm on CD6, but much better synchronization. 10 eggs retrieved, 6 mature, 3 fertilized, 1 8-cell on day 3 (transferred) and 2 4-cell that ultimately arrested. Negative beta. RE felt our results were due to sperm quality and recommended upping my dosages to retrieve more eggs to compensate for poor sperm quality. 

Flash forward to today- got a second opinion from a highly recommended clinic that just became in network for us. Turns out my prior RE trained under this one; small world. 

His opinion: the natural start and high doses on my last cycle overstimulated me. I probably had several over mature eggs at retrieval, and should have started on lower doses, and started the antagonist sooner. The 'mature' eggs may not have been fully mature, leading to early arrest in culture. So this cycle, he is starting me on mid-luteal BCPs for 10 days. No lupron. His theory is it will lead to better synchronization and we'll get better quality eggs as a consequence with a higher chance of getting to blasts.

 *Sub Rules and links to info and results threads below*

Welcome to r/infertility. **Please read our rules and our sidebar to familiarize yourself with the customs and guidelines of our subreddit before posting and participating here.**  
Please refer to the bottom of this post for the links to the Monthly Waiting and Weekly Results threads.

**SUB RULES**

Our sub has strict rules for participation. We ask that all members familiarize themselves with them in full, but here are the key points:

1. **All initial positive pregnancy test (beta & HPT) results should ONLY be mentioned in the weekly results thread.**

2. Discussions of beta results after the second test, including beta-hell / limbo, uncertain results, or early infertility pregnancy issues/fears should ONLY be discussed in the post-beta thread (stickied under this thread each week). This thread was specifically created for those who are having issues and need a place to be supported.

3. Mention of pregnancy or live children is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as we had success after x,y,z protocol). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed. Note that mentions of pregnancy loss are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area.

4. Infertility is not cute, therefore cutesy acronyms (BD, AF (when used as a Aunt Flo), DH, Embies, follies, etc) are banned. The full list of banned terms can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7t7092/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms_terms/).

5. Infertility is stressful and it is easier to step on people’s toes than you might think. Please consider the emotional state of others during discussion here. Venting, jealousy and bitterness is to be expected.
 
6. No linking our posts outside of the infertility family.

7. If you see a post that breaks any of our rules or is troublesome to you please **use the report button**. The mods are happy to assess and remove or address reported posts. Let's all help keep this a safe, supportive community.

**Guidelines**

* Use the dailies! There are AM & PM threads posted by the automod. The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to treatment. The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.

* Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. 

**Helpful Links**

Members of this sub can be here for a long time and certain posts can get repetitive. Please use the search function before posting questions that may be more common. A few helpful mega-threads and FAQ threads can be found at the links below:

For those who have been trying for a while or starting with infertility testing / treatment r/stilltrying has been a helpful transition sub for many before joining here.
For those who need support TTC after loss, r/TTCafterloss can provide unique support for this.

For those who have become pregnant after ART/IF treatment, or who have questions for people who have had success, r/infertilitybabies is for you.
For those transitioning to child free life after infertility r/IFchildfree is a safe space for this.

For those with children who are experiencing infertility trying for more, r/secondaryinfertility may be helpful and is a safe space to mention existing children while you explore your IF.


There is a sub just for male infertility as well if any of our male members would like to connect with others in their shoes. /r/maleinfertility

<p><em>Sub Rules and links to info and results threads below</em></p>

<p>Welcome to <a href=""/r/infertility"">r/infertility</a>. <strong>Please read our rules and our sidebar to familiarize yourself with the customs and guidelines of our subreddit before posting and participating here.</strong><br/>
Please refer to the bottom of this post for the links to the Monthly Waiting and Weekly Results threads.</p>

<p><strong>SUB RULES</strong></p>

<p>Our sub has strict rules for participation. We ask that all members familiarize themselves with them in full, but here are the key points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>All initial positive pregnancy test (beta &amp; HPT) results should ONLY be mentioned in the weekly results thread.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Discussions of beta results after the second test, including beta-hell / limbo, uncertain results, or early infertility pregnancy issues/fears should ONLY be discussed in the post-beta thread (stickied under this thread each week). This thread was specifically created for those who are having issues and need a place to be supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Mention of pregnancy or live children is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as we had success after x,y,z protocol). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed. Note that mentions of pregnancy loss are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area.</p></li>
<li><p>Infertility is not cute, therefore cutesy acronyms (BD, AF (when used as a Aunt Flo), DH, Embies, follies, etc) are banned. The full list of banned terms can be found <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7t7092/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms_terms/"">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Infertility is stressful and it is easier to step on people’s toes than you might think. Please consider the emotional state of others during discussion here. Venting, jealousy and bitterness is to be expected.</p></li>
<li><p>No linking our posts outside of the infertility family.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see a post that breaks any of our rules or is troublesome to you please <strong>use the report button</strong>. The mods are happy to assess and remove or address reported posts. Let&#39;s all help keep this a safe, supportive community.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Guidelines</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the dailies! There are AM &amp; PM threads posted by the automod. The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to treatment. The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Helpful Links</strong></p>

<p>Members of this sub can be here for a long time and certain posts can get repetitive. Please use the search function before posting questions that may be more common. A few helpful mega-threads and FAQ threads can be found at the links below:</p>

47,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My common-law husband and myself have been trying for a baby for over 2 years now.

We have only recently started ""coming out"" regarding it. 

While out for dinner with a very close friend,  I casually mentioned how I've decided to be more opened regarding our infertility.  (My husband's sperm count is too low for us to conceive naturally.) (To add context: IT IS NOT THE ONLY THING I DISCUSS! I forget how we got on the topic. 
 )

This woman at the table with us (my good friend's friend), suddenly butted him,  ""Oh no.  You're not infertile! You're just  not compatible!"" 

""Er,  what?"" 

""You're just not compatible.""

""That's... not the definition of infertility...""

Her: ""NOPE!My brother's a Doctor.  You are not infertile. "" 

Husband: ""Uh.  We can't conceive naturally.""

Her: ""But you can conceive with medical intervention!"" 

Now,  during this entire thing,  I was so shocked and surprised.  What the HECK was she arguing about? Why did she butt in or care? And what did she mean that we weren't ""compatible""? My husband has a low sperm count... he's not compatible with anyone,  then?

We know she's wrong.  We cannot conceive naturally.  We need IVF.  But what brought this up? Why fight us?

I didn't argue.  I wish I had. But I barely know her.  My other friends (husband and wife) remained quiet.  (They are suffering with infertility,  too. ) At the moment,  the server came to take our orders.  

To add insult to injury, she kept saying like; ""ALL my friends have went through it!"" Which I didn't really understand how that related to me.  

  Besides my one infertile friend,  everyone else I know got pregnant easily and NONE of them are getting IVF.  I feel so alone most of the time! Yet it earnestly felt like she was attempting to make it seem like it was no big deal. (Really,  it's mentally harming us. ) 

And this isn't the first time that this has occurred! When my other friend fell pregnant and I had to tell him I may need space from he and his wife,  he kept insisting;  ""You're not infertile!"" (He then proceeded to say some very hurtful things under the guise of us not ""actually"" being infertile. )

At the end of the dinner,  the other woman gives me a hug and says; ""You need to not think about it.  If you get stressed, it won't happen.  You need to not be stressed. ""

At the time,  I thought very little of it.  

But now,  a few hours later,  I feel angry and wish I had spoken up.  I wish I had google it.  What she said was insensitive! No amount of positive thinking will make my husband's few sperm make it to my egg?!

<p>We have only recently started &quot;coming out&quot; regarding it. </p>

<p>While out for dinner with a very close friend,  I casually mentioned how I&#39;ve decided to be more opened regarding our infertility.  (My husband&#39;s sperm count is too low for us to conceive naturally.) (To add context: IT IS NOT THE ONLY THING I DISCUSS! I forget how we got on the topic. 
 )</p>

<p>This woman at the table with us (my good friend&#39;s friend), suddenly butted him,  &quot;Oh no.  You&#39;re not infertile! You&#39;re just  not compatible!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Er,  what?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re just not compatible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s... not the definition of infertility...&quot;</p>

<p>Her: &quot;NOPE!My brother&#39;s a Doctor.  You are not infertile. &quot; </p>

<p>Husband: &quot;Uh.  We can&#39;t conceive naturally.&quot;</p>

<p>Her: &quot;But you can conceive with medical intervention!&quot; </p>

<p>Now,  during this entire thing,  I was so shocked and surprised.  What the HECK was she arguing about? Why did she butt in or care? And what did she mean that we weren&#39;t &quot;compatible&quot;? My husband has a low sperm count... he&#39;s not compatible with anyone,  then?</p>

<p>We know she&#39;s wrong.  We cannot conceive naturally.  We need IVF.  But what brought this up? Why fight us?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t argue.  I wish I had. But I barely know her.  My other friends (husband and wife) remained quiet.  (They are suffering with infertility,  too. ) At the moment,  the server came to take our orders.  </p>

<p>To add insult to injury, she kept saying like; &quot;ALL my friends have went through it!&quot; Which I didn&#39;t really understand how that related to me.  </p>

<p>Besides my one infertile friend,  everyone else I know got pregnant easily and NONE of them are getting IVF.  I feel so alone most of the time! Yet it earnestly felt like she was attempting to make it seem like it was no big deal. (Really,  it&#39;s mentally harming us. ) </p>

<p>And this isn&#39;t the first time that this has occurred! When my other friend fell pregnant and I had to tell him I may need space from he and his wife,  he kept insisting;  &quot;You&#39;re not infertile!&quot; (He then proceeded to say some very hurtful things under the guise of us not &quot;actually&quot; being infertile. )</p>

<p>At the end of the dinner,  the other woman gives me a hug and says; &quot;You need to not think about it.  If you get stressed, it won&#39;t happen.  You need to not be stressed. &quot;</p>

<p>She knows nothing pertaining to our situation.  </p>

<p>At the time,  I thought very little of it.  </p>

It’s IVF round #1, first everything for me.  Minimal physical side effects up until after ER.  Prior to that, just VERY hormonal.

I got there at 9:30am, had an IV in my arm by 10:15 (they were a little behind schedule).  The anesthesiologist gives me zofran and something else for nausea then brings a small cup of something I’m supposed to choke down that’s an acid neutralizer.

I can’t do shots.  I have never been able to gulp down liquid but for some idiotic reason, I go for it.  I proceed to choke and get some down the wrong pipe.  I’m now choking, gasping for air, coughing, belching, gagging and close to drooling.  I have completely burned my throat doing this.  

I completely start to sweat and instantly panic.  Every time I clear my throat, I choke again and it’s so bad, I can’t talk.  

They’re trying to figure out what to do to help me and what I need, either Pepcid chewables, can’t be given to me before surgery.

They offer to numb my throat with their version of chloraseptic which just scares the crap out of me and I realize my body’s own protective mechanisms are kicking in and the mucous production is working to coat my burning throat.

Fast forward 10 minutes and I’m WAY better but my throat is still easily agitated.  I get walked to the procedural room.

The table is t what I expected and the stirrups FINALLY make sense.  They aren’t stirrups, they’re more like indented knee rests.  

I sit on the edge on the table (not as close to the edge as a normal pelvic), sling my legs into the knee rests, which is actually comfy.  Then lie back.

And choke again.  

They were able to prop me up a tad and I just breathed out of my nose and tried not to swallow or clear my throat.  I remember the oxygen mask going on.

At some point I went under.

No memory of being walked back to the chair.  

Pain was a 3 out of 10.  No bleeding.

I went home, napped, felt good enough to go to dinner.

21 follicles, 17 eggs.  Got the call that they were doing ICHSE.

Pain is now a 6 but the discomfort from the bloating and pressure from my ever filling bladder is non stop.  There’s no comfortable position I can find and every movement is met with a twinge of pain.  It’s not excruciating but I’m super tired and can’t sleep.

Also, it hurts to stand up straight.  

I’m a little frustrated because I could have been drinking Gatorade and protein drinks today to help but no one mentioned it to me.  Not sure it would actually help but would have like to have known to try.

Im not doing the transfer until at least summer so have some time to recover unlike a few of the other posters.

If anyone has any tips, I’m all ears.

We just went through a round of Mini IVF.

My Wife is slightly over 39.  I am 45.

Rough story of this cycle:  
4 eggs retrieved.
3 Fertilized.
2 Went to Bioplast.
Both failed PGS.  (1 with Multiple abnormalities. 1 Aneuploid )

We are pretty happy with the clinic overall.
Nice enough people, responsive to questions, no problems with making appointments/phone calls/etc.

There were no reactions at all to the drugs ( Follistem / Ganirelix / Ovidrel).  I heard from other friends doing IVF that there would be mood swings/etc, but we couldn't see any side effects at all.  I don't know whether it is because the mini-ivf doses are low, or if the mood swings are for the ""implant drugs"" and not for the ""egg retrieval drugs"".

Overall, it has been pretty painless, except for the disappointment and hit in time/money.

There's one side that thinks:  compared to our friends who did regular IVF, It was far less stressful/painful.  We also had a far higher ratio of eggs/bioplasts.  

On the other hand, with the lower total # of eggs, and some bad luck, we ended up with nothing.

So my question is, do you think we should continue Mini ivf for a few more cycles?   Is her/my age high enough where should go for regular IVF?   When we asked this morning (before getting PGS results), the doctor said that regular IVF isn't necessarily better.  

We live in Manhattan, and are using New Hope Fertility (convenient by subway).

A bit confused at this point.  Any recommendations/suggestions are greatly appreciated.  ",t2_qnv5ib0,False,,0,False,Bad PGS results with Mini IVF.

But my main question is - What all have you guys tried/been recommended to try to increase your response to IVF meds?  Asked my re about a low carb diet and he said maybe...

I'm on coq10 and a few other supplements.  I've also gotten the 'no' for dhea from 3 REs now... Not sure what the deal is on that as it seems other people take it.  

I also went on the keto diet with my husband after my failed ivf and managed to completely skip a period so that was weird... Maybe too low carb?  Been just trying to ""eat healthy"" since then...  I'm probably a little overweight since I've put on 20 pounds since my first miscarriage, but my RE isn't worried about it.  

Background on me: 32 yo, trying for #1 for about 2 years.  Had 3 early losses, 1 confirmed chromosomal.  Found out I have diminished ovarian reserve, Amh tested at 0.6 and 0.9.  FSH 11.8.  went straight to ivf with PGS.  Microdose Lupron flare with HGH with BCP start.  4 follicles in 1 ovary, 1 5day blast, tested pgs abnormal. Left ovary did nothing.   Ended up switching clinics because I wanted to try without the bcp/batched cycles.  Did a second ivf- natural cycle start estrogen and antagonist primed, antagonist cycle.  Even response in both ovaries, stimmed for 14 days, only had 2 mature follicles.  Ovulated thru my cetrotide just before retrieval, got 1 egg at retrieval, immature..  

So, at the moment I'm back to trying naturally, considering another ivf in the next couple months.  Likely back to a Lupron cycle...

Hi Emily,

I recently read your book There is No Good Card for This, and, by and large, thought it was great (it was fun to see cards I recognized in it, too). Reflecting on my experiences, I found that the people I appreciated most during tough times were the best followers of your advice. I loved that I was able to identify my pitfalls and to have steps so I can grow from reading it. So, thank you.

One exception - you talk about ""hopeful stories: helpful, most of the time"" and offered a few things that would be helpful to say to someone going through infertility. I disagreed to the extent that I set down the book a few days and questioned everything else you had written. I contemplated throwing it in the fireplace. Then I realized that it’s a gas fireplace so I can’t actually do that (and a library book and I didn’t want to pay a fine). So, I stewed some more, and it occurred to me that you haven’t experienced infertility, so you probably have the same misconceptions about it as everyone else. And who better to teach than someone who’s been there? Here goes:

There’s a widespread myth that infertility is always treatable.

We only hear about success stories after they’ve become success stories. This is fair: for all kinds of reasons, which you discussed in your book, we don’t talk about it while we’re going through it. Unlike less taboo diseases, nobody hears about it in the midst of uncertainty. They find out that you’ve been struggling for x years and tried y times only after you’ve gotten pregnant. 

Furthermore, we don’t hear about people that go through treatment and don’t end up with kids. People stop for all kinds of reasons – saving remaining sanity, wanting their lives back, employer inflexibility with ridiculous and last-minute amounts of time off, running out of money, running out of time, etc. But they don’t talk about it. And why would they? The response they get is full of hope and lacking empathy and understanding – when they’ve finally come to terms (or not) with their decision (or lack of options); they’re told to keep trying. Only knowing about success means we assume that people without kids just don’t want to have kids. It makes a lack of success all the more isolating. 

When I tell someone about infertility, some of the last things I want to hear are “My friend got pregnant on her third try with IVF” or “My friend had three miscarriages, and her fourth pregnancy is now a walking toddler.” These being juxtaposed in your book with three other examples with qualifiers like “that’s my hope for you” or “every situation is unique,” but leaving them out on these specific examples, further perpetuates the myth that all infertility eventually ends in successful treatment. Breakups, cancer, and divorce are different for everyone, but when it comes to infertility, just hang in there and you will be successful. If only. 

If I want hope, I don’t care if it’s distant. My dad’s best friend’s wife getting pregnant at 42 from IVF doesn’t get me pregnant. Knowing that my mom's workout acquaintance's daughter had success after 10 tries does not guarantee that it will work if I try it another 7. Those stories got me equally hopeful and equally pregnant as jgreeneyes28 on babycenter 2012. The internet has enough hope. An anecdote can’t get me pregnant regardless of degrees of separation. 

If I’m seeking human contact it’s for someone to listen. And in some cases, it’s to find connections. My mom was able to connect me with a friend’s daughter who had experienced infertility. Ultimately, she was successful, which was great (for her, irrelevant to my experience), but she was able to give me practical information on clinics in our area, and gave me great advice to come to terms with the fact that it’s not a guarantee now – rather than figuring it out after failure. I also learned about family friends who had sought treatment, but ultimately were not successful and chose not to continue treatment. As much as I didn’t use them as a resource then, knowing that there are people who go on to live fulfilling lives without children was helpful. But it’s really being connected with people, rather than a success story, that meant the most to me.

I’d love that in a future version you rewrite the section on hopeful stories. Infertility examples aside, I’m not sold on it being good advice (but again, spot on with almost everything else in those 243 pages). I’d call it “Hopeful stories: who are these really about?” 

“Be really careful with ‘hopeful stories.’ If you feel tempted to share an anecdote, reflect on whether it’s really about you and your discomfort. Is this another way of you trying to fix things? If you determine it’s not about you, ask before sharing. You could say ‘do you find it helpful or encouraging to hear stories of others’ success?’ or go the route of human connection ‘I have a friend who experienced infertility – if she’s willing, would you be interested in me connecting you with her?’”

We’ve been experiencing infertility for 3 years now and I’ve been ready to share my story for a full year. The fear of the unwanted advice, anecdotes, pity, and questions has held me back. I think your book does a great job of addressing almost all of that, but I’d love to see an edit to make it perfect.

Thanks,

For my first and second cycles, I told my parents, immediate family, and close friends. It was around 20 people. We started with a urologist in June 2015, RE in July 2016, and first IVF was in September 2016. All this time has passed and all we have to show for it is failure - a 8 week miscarriage, 1 CP, and 1 complete failure of a cycle. We are just about $60,000 into this hell and no closer to a successful pregnancy. Like my flair says, *when you're going through hell, keep going.* 

My friends and family have basically stopped asking for updates and for the most part, I've stopped sharing. Last treatment was in April. Baseline for cycle #3 is Jan 11th and the only people who know are my parents and my best friend. I basically leave town for 2.5 weeks during stims so it's really hard to distract and disengage from my friends during this time. I live in a small town and due to my job, I basically have to announce to 150 people that I'm not going to be at work. I'm in a curling league and will have to make up stories for why I'm missing 3 weeks in a row. It just sucks that I can't hide from it all. I wish I lived closer to my RE. Fuck. I wish a lot of things. That wish is the bottom of the barrel.

The hardest part about failing so many times has been updating people on our failures. Part of me wants to tell 2 more friends so I have some support. But God damn do I loathe the idea of those looks of pity when we will inevitably fail again.

So those of you who keep failing but keep going, what do you tell your nearest and dearest? Is the support worth it in exchange for the pity?

Wondering if anyone can help me out, I don’t go back to the RE until January 30. 

I have lean PCOS.

I’ve been on metformin (2000mg a day)since January and have always ovulated between day 15-17.  My progesterone has been anywhere from 12-18 while on metformin ( usually at a 2 with no meds) 

A few months ago I added femara into the mix but it was giving me terrible headaches.

I’ve now done two clomid cycles at 50mg and 2000mg of metformin a day. The first month went perfectly, ovulation day 15 and progesterone was at a 30 . 

And now we are on month #2 and day 22 and nothing !  I was using ovulation sticks and got 5 days of “high fertility “ and then ran out of tests. I can tell when I ovulate though, and I definitely haven’t.

So I’m not sure what’s going on. 

I ovulate fine with just metformin and one month of clomid and then nothing ...

I have been lurking for a while and finally decided to post cause why the hell not. 

Wife is 32, I am 30. Been trying for 2 years. Earlier this year I went through a bilateral varicocelectomy and this resulting in my morphology increasing from 1% to 12%. We were excited and hopeful again. 

Her RE finally decided to test her after my morphology increased and she has low amh 0.5, highish FSH 10, AFC ~7. Was diagnosed with the fun ""diminished ovarian reserve"" 

We spent a year thinking I was the problem and now maybe she is, or is it both, who knows... Just pissed they didn't test her off the bat and we were wasting time. 

We did 2 IUI's since then, doctor wanted 3 but we decided we are wasting our time and money and are jumping into the deep end (IVF). 

Here is the kicker - we have consulted 2 RE's in the US + 1 overseas. All keep telling us we have a 45-50% chance of live birth. All the CDC and SART data I look at says bullshit and more like a 20-25% chance with her age and a diagnosis of DOR. Are all of these doctors pulling optimism out of their asses?

Both are younger and both have beautiful one-year-old children.  While they were both pregnant I underwent a double-mastectomy.  When they had their babies I began chemotherapy.  It KILLED me to watch them because I was so happy for them and so sad for me.   

Now my treatment is done and my husband and I are starting on our IVF journey.  We've also had a failed adoption but are actively waiting, just in case we meet an expectant mother/father who might want to choose us. 

I love these women dearly and they have supported me through everything, but I also feel as if I have nothing in common with them anymore.  Their world is consumed by their children and it's become the same for all the inlaws.  We went to visit for the holidays and all anyone talked about or focused on was the babies.  I love those kids and we spent hours together playing and having fun.  I loved every minute but that's ALL. WE. DID.  No one was even capable of talking about anything else.  I asked about their jobs, they answered briefly.  No one asked about mine.  I asked about their New Years plans.  They told me all about what they would be doing with the babies.  No one asked about mine.  At one point both my sister-in-laws, their husbands, and the babies all abandoned our dinner table to let the kids run around (which is fair since they are little kids at a fancy restaurant and shouldn't have to sit for hours).  I realized we were literally left alone at the table with no one talking to us. I cried. 

I began my doctoral program this summer as well as a new job.  I am so excited about both of them.  No one asked me about either and I was pretty crushed by this.  I even made a desperately pathetic bid to bring it up several times myself and no one asked a single thing or commented on it; just a nod and a smile.  And--irony of all ironies--my doctorate is in Early Childhood/Early Childhood Special Ed so it's *directly* related to their current focus of babies...and still no one asked.  

I am so upset over my own infertility that I cannot even tell if my hurt feelings are justified.  It was such a painful weekend and I don't know how to cope.  No one is deliberately trying to be hurtful but it was a terrible weekend all the same.  I can't even manage to get my mind wrapped around what I will do when we go back for another visit.  Also, as much as I want to be a mother, I will also always love my career, and I feel they are the opposite (a job just pays the bills but family is the real goal).  When none of us had children we were at least able to talk about other things but now I am clearly on the outside looking in.  Even if/when I become a parent I know I will always be highly career-driven, it's just who I am.  

I don't know how to let it go.  While I will always smile and grin for the sake of everyone else, I want to be able to cope better for my own mental well-being.  I just feel lost.

I'm 24 with PCOS and my husband is 25, healthy as a horse. We haven't used protection since May 2015 and have been actively seeking treatments for almost 2 years. 

First went to a fertility clinic for a year and did 2 cycles of Clomid (ovulated but hated the side effects) and 8 cycles of Femera (ovulated perfectly but never a pregnancy). Between the treatments I  also got a lap&HSG and everything was all clear. 

After Dr A couldn't help me anymore we moved onto IVF at the advice of Doctor B and were given an 80% positive outlook for cycle #1. Low and behold, we spent $20,000+ out of pocket for nothing. I had 41 follicles, 28 eggs retrived, 13 fertilized. Only 2 embryos made it to 6 day blasts and upon PGS testing both were abnormal. 

After going to our follow-up apt doc said his whole clinic was dumbfounded as to how this happened and it was just a fluke, and we should try again. 

My husband and I both want children SO badly, but this is a very expensive 2nd shot as we're 100% out of pocket. Is it worth it to spend all this money AGAIN on a chance for a child?

178,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi there, sorry this is so long. Firstly, I just want to say thank you to those of you who have been friendly to me and supportive, I really appreciate it. I’m kind of a cynical bitch so I love reading everyone’s rants because it makes me feel that I’m actually normal to feel bitter sometimes.

I’m really sad right now with the holidays. It gets to me badly. Last year I realized that I had said “next year we will have a baby and it will be so much fun!” for the last several years, and it still wasn’t true. And it crushed me. I used to love holiday decorating so much, but it died for me last year. This year we went through our first IVF retrieval. So next year, if we don’t have a baby/are pregnant we have agreed to “not do” Christmas and go in a trip, because I just can’t stand it anymore.

Today was the worst, talking on the phone with my husband’s grandmother gushing about how happy she was to hold her great-grandchild today. My husband is the oldest grandchild (he’s 37) and we were the first to get married (it’s been 6+ years now). His cousin is a year younger than me (I’m 32) and got pregnant the first month off of BC 🙄. It was torture hearing grandma talk about how “peaceful and beautiful” it was to hold her great-grandchild and how modern and lovely their nursery was. I wanted to die. I also feel so guilty for that because I love all of my in laws, they are such wonderful l people. But at this he same time, godammit, this particular cousin literally has everything go perfect in her life! I’m just glad I wasn’t there for the pregnancy announcement last Easter, not just for myself but for her own brother and sister-in-law who are in the same situation as us, because he is a stage 4 leukemia survivor who was expected to die 5 years ago (they were going to start trying the same month he was diagnosed)! I heard he had to leave the room when they announced it. Insensitive cow! 

Anyway, back to me. On Thursday I learned that only one embryo made it to freeze for our first IVF/ICSI and I’ve been pretty depressed since then.

Firstly, I just want to say thank you to those of you who have been friendly to me and supportive, I really appreciate it. I’m kind of a cynical bitch so I love reading everyone’s rants because it makes me feel that I’m actually normal to feel bitter sometimes.</p>

<p>I’m really sad right now with the holidays. It gets to me badly. Last year I realized that I had said “next year we will have a baby and it will be so much fun!” for the last several years, and it still wasn’t true. And it crushed me. I used to love holiday decorating so much, but it died for me last year. This year we went through our first IVF retrieval. So next year, if we don’t have a baby/are pregnant we have agreed to “not do” Christmas and go in a trip, because I just can’t stand it anymore.</p>

<p>Today was the worst, talking on the phone with my husband’s grandmother gushing about how happy she was to hold her great-grandchild today. My husband is the oldest grandchild (he’s 37) and we were the first to get married (it’s been 6+ years now). His cousin is a year younger than me (I’m 32) and got pregnant the first month off of BC 🙄. It was torture hearing grandma talk about how “peaceful and beautiful” it was to hold her great-grandchild and how modern and lovely their nursery was. I wanted to die. I also feel so guilty for that because I love all of my in laws, they are such wonderful l people. But at this he same time, godammit, this particular cousin literally has everything go perfect in her life! I’m just glad I wasn’t there for the pregnancy announcement last Easter, not just for myself but for her own brother and sister-in-law who are in the same situation as us, because he is a stage 4 leukemia survivor who was expected to die 5 years ago (they were going to start trying the same month he was diagnosed)! I heard he had to leave the room when they announced it. Insensitive cow! </p>

<p>Anyway, back to me. On Thursday I learned that only one embryo made it to freeze for our first IVF/ICSI and I’ve been pretty depressed since then. I know it’s better than zero.... but it’s not very good odds either. At the beginning of my cycle I only had 7 follicles, then I jumped to 14 on my day 11 appt.

I don't know if I would be stepping on toes posting here and understand that I'm not exactly in your shoes yet but not exactly the average TFAB poster either.  

My story:  I don't ovulate regularly on my own.  I've known that for a long time.  I stopped taking HBC when I was 20 and found that it had apparently masked my very irregular cycles.  When my cycles still had not regulated after 2.5 years I started testing to find out why, even before officially TTC.  I was referred to an RE who found I did not ovulate.  At that time, I had lots of antral follicles each month but none ever developed beyond that.  We did not find a cause for my anovulation as all my bloodwork was basically normal.   The RE at the time said my chances were going to be highest while I was still young and I did have success with Clomid 8.5 years ago.  I also had one MC at 8 weeks, and one CP. 

Both I and my RE thought I didn't ever ovulate on my own/unmedicated but I conceived on my own in 2011 so I did at least once.  We were not using protection (total about 20 months) and I was not getting periods.  Even my doctor was surprised.

For reasons unrelated to this, I got divorced in 2011.  I was separated before even knowing that I was pregnant again.  It was the best decision I've ever made and am now happily remarried.  I'd like to have a child with my now husband which brings me here.  I have moved so can no longer see the same RE but my current OB is fantastic, knows all my history, and still believes I don't ovulate on my own, as do I.  She thinks I should not wait to try naturally at all and should immediately start with Clomid and an RE.  I also got the ""at my age"" speech, (um lady, I'm 33!), but she's got a point; if it was not easy at 23 it didn't get easier at 33.  

So that's where I am now.  I had my Mirena removed on Oct 16 and am now on CD26 of my first post Mirena cycle, no O yet.  I had my first twanding of this go-round two days ago and have an order for CD3 bloodwork.  I'm waiting on the RE referral.  

And to get back to the original point of the post, where do I go for support?  I'm not quite fertile enough to feel totally comfortable in TFAB, although I have been posting there.  I'm just starting trying for this one, so stilltrying doesn't seem right either.  And maybe I'm a little too fertile to be here.  Like I said, I'm infertilish.  Where do I vent?

202,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'll just get right into this. So I have 4 sisters and one of them just announced to our family that her and her husband were expecting their first child due in May. We were thrilled for them as they had been married for 3-4 years and were finally expecting a baby. She even sent out darling announcements to family about a month and a half ago. 

A few weeks ago I was visiting her and another sister of mine who live in the same area. Well she told me that they had done genetic testing and were waiting to find out the results of if her baby was going to have Down Syndrome. I left home the next day and as we were getting off the airplane, she had emailed my dad that they had gotten the blood tests back and it was positive for her child having DS. 

My mother was terrified she would terminate the pregnancy and honestly so was I. She mentioned to us that if the amniocentesis was positive she would terminate. Well a week went by and she texted me about something else and we started talking about how she was feeling. I then mentioned to her that my husband and I would love to adopt her baby if she was open to that. She told me she had actually thought about it and would only adopt her baby to me, she knows I could provide for the baby and I want to be a SAHM, and I also live close to our parents who want to help out too. She said she liked that idea because then she could still have some involvement in the baby life.  I was thrilled, my parents were ecstatic, and we went along thinking that this would be something to discuss when she came home for christmas with her husband. 

My sister then chose to have an amniocentesis. The results take about a week and a half to get back so I kind of figured I wouldn't talk with her about adoption until she got here for christmas. However two days ago she texted me again about something else and I asked her if she had talked with her husband about adoption and how she was still feeling about it. 

She replied that she was no longer comfortable with it because it would be too devastating to her, she wants to terminate so she can quickly move along with starting her family, and that it was a really shitty situation and she likened it to what I have had to go through. 

OMG I wanted to kill her. I chose to reply only that I understood and I loved her. I literally couldn't even right at that moment. I was out shopping and dealing with crowds and couldn't deal with it all right then. Several hours later after I got home I started reading through her texts again and started getting irate. I was furious that she says adoption would be too devastating to her but I guess abortion wouldn't..wtf?!? Also, I'm furious that she as a 35 year old woman says she wants to quickly move on to 'start her family' when THAT IS WHAT SHE HAS ALREADY DONE! They made a conscious decision to get pregnant and start a family and I guess her little baby girl isn't exactly what she wants. 

I'm so sick about this. One of my sisters is so furious with her she called her the other night to talk about it and she hung up on her, now one of them has threatened to not come home. Its a huge mess. And the thing that makes me the most irate is that I have now gone through 4 IVF cycles with a GC and my sister KNOWS this and here she is telling me she would rather terminate then let me adopt her DS baby girl. I'm so sad about this and mad at my sister. 

Sorry I know this is a long rant post but as you can see this is a huge problem and my entire family is about to be here for several days and I feel like I have to get this off my chest in hopes of being able to stay calm at our family gatherings. Like I need to get my anger out here so its doesn't brew up inside me so I erupt when I am face to face with her. 

I don't even know what to say other than hang in there everyone this holiday season. :) Heaven knows we already have to deal with so much 

EDITED TO ADD: guys I have no problem with her making whatever choice she feels is best for her. I know it is her body and her and her husbands decision only.

<p>My sister then chose to have an amniocentesis. The results take about a week and a half to get back so I kind of figured I wouldn&#39;t talk with her about adoption until she got here for christmas. However two days ago she texted me again about something else and I asked her if she had talked with her husband about adoption and how she was still feeling about it. </p>

<p>She replied that she was no longer comfortable with it because it would be too devastating to her, she wants to terminate so she can quickly move along with starting her family, and that it was a really shitty situation and she likened it to what I have had to go through. </p>

<p>OMG I wanted to kill her. I chose to reply only that I understood and I loved her. I literally couldn&#39;t even right at that moment. I was out shopping and dealing with crowds and couldn&#39;t deal with it all right then. Several hours later after I got home I started reading through her texts again and started getting irate. I was furious that she says adoption would be too devastating to her but I guess abortion wouldn&#39;t..wtf?!? Also, I&#39;m furious that she as a 35 year old woman says she wants to quickly move on to &#39;start her family&#39; when THAT IS WHAT SHE HAS ALREADY DONE! They made a conscious decision to get pregnant and start a family and I guess her little baby girl isn&#39;t exactly what she wants. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so sick about this. One of my sisters is so furious with her she called her the other night to talk about it and she hung up on her, now one of them has threatened to not come home. Its a huge mess. And the thing that makes me the most irate is that I have now gone through 4 IVF cycles with a GC and my sister KNOWS this and here she is telling me she would rather terminate then let me adopt her DS baby girl. I&#39;m so sad about this and mad at my sister. </p>

<p>Sorry I know this is a long rant post but as you can see this is a huge problem and my entire family is about to be here for several days and I feel like I have to get this off my chest in hopes of being able to stay calm at our family gatherings. Like I need to get my anger out here so its doesn&#39;t brew up inside me so I erupt when I am face to face with her. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know what to say other than hang in there everyone this holiday season. :) Heaven knows we already have to deal with so much </p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD: guys I have no problem with her making whatever choice she feels is best for her. I know it is her body and her and her husbands decision only. I will always love her and nothing will change that. I am merely venting about my sadness about her telling me she wanted me to adopt her baby to telling me she changed her mind. I am going through that grieving process and that is what my rant is about. </p>

216,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,

I originally posted this over on tryingforababy, but I didn't know this sub existed and I think it fits better here.

Long story short, my husband and I have been TTC to since March of 2016. We tried 3 cycles of Clomid with my regular OBGYN earlier this year. I had terrible side effects (OMG, I felt like I was melting) and it messed up my cycles (it made them 14-17 days long) and still no ovulation.

I decided to go see an RE because I just knew something wasn't right, and she ordered a whole workup of tests to find out what was going on. After a month of testing and waiting we met with her yesterday and finally got some answers that I want to share with you guys because (1) I don't have a lot of people in my real life I can talk to about this - why is TTC a half-taboo subject!?) and (2) maybe someone else has been through this and can share some insight.

I did have an HSG and SHG and thankfully, neither was painful for me. However, my tubes are completely open so that might be why the HSG didn't hurt.

First - it turns out that my thyroid was low which can cause weight gain (check), dry skin (check), anovulatory cycles (check), so my RE put me on a low dose of levothyroxine that I will continue until the day I deliver. She also said that low thyroid function could potentially cause low IQ in baby.

Second - my uterus is full of polyps and I have mild endometriosis which she said can attribute to infertility and most likely explains my mid-cycle bleeding and painful periods. She said that since my Aunt had ovarian cancer (she passed away when I was 10), these polyps need to come out because while they are most-likely benign, there is a small chance they could be/become cancerous, in addition to them causing infertility.

So my next steps are that I will start taking the thyroid medicine now, and in January I'll have a minor surgery to remove the polyps and endometriosis. To remove the endometriosis, she'll make a small incision near my bellybutton and go in laparoscopically, and to remove the polyps she'll go in through my cervix. After I'm healed from the surgery and I've been taking the levothyroxine for a couple of months, she suggests that we go forward with IUI/clomid.

So, while I am not excited to have surgery (even though it's minor), I am relieved to have some answers and know more about what's going on. I had a feeling she was going to say ""Everything is normal! Thanks for the thousands of dollars you've just spent. Keep trying and relax, it will happen!""

Is anyone else here dealing with low thyroid function / endometriosis / polyps?

Did thyroid replacement help you, and how long until you started noticing any difference?

How long/painful is the recovery from the polyp removal surgery? I am a teacher and NOT excited about missing 4-5 days of school (it is so much work to have a sub), but it is what it is so I'll make it work.

She said that since my Aunt had ovarian cancer (she passed away when I was 10), these polyps need to come out because while they are most-likely benign, there is a small chance they could be/become cancerous, in addition to them causing infertility.</p>

<p>So my next steps are that I will start taking the thyroid medicine now, and in January I&#39;ll have a minor surgery to remove the polyps and endometriosis. To remove the endometriosis, she&#39;ll make a small incision near my bellybutton and go in laparoscopically, and to remove the polyps she&#39;ll go in through my cervix. After I&#39;m healed from the surgery and I&#39;ve been taking the levothyroxine for a couple of months, she suggests that we go forward with IUI/clomid.</p>

<p>So, while I am not excited to have surgery (even though it&#39;s minor), I am relieved to have some answers and know more about what&#39;s going on. I had a feeling she was going to say &quot;Everything is normal! Thanks for the thousands of dollars you&#39;ve just spent. Keep trying and relax, it will happen!&quot;</p>

<p>Is anyone else here dealing with low thyroid function / endometriosis / polyps?</p>

<p>Did thyroid replacement help you, and how long until you started noticing any difference?</p>

<p>How long/painful is the recovery from the polyp removal surgery? I am a teacher and NOT excited about missing 4-5 days of school (it is so much work to have a sub), but it is what it is so I&#39;ll make it work.</p>

<p>Thank you all!</p>

I have had a helluva day, with lots of new information and now I need to make some decisions about our next steps for getting us a baby. I made Mr Pops take the day off and spend it with me at the hospital for my appointments

As a bit of history, in June I got a diagnosis which benched us while I got treatment for endometrial hyperplasia (mirena iud which was removed today) and I made it a goal to lose weight while I waited, which has hopefully Improved my prognosis when I get retested in January. Also while I waited I saw worked on getting my thyroid sorted, and looked into an IVF clinic which would be mostly covered by universal health care, who gave me a goal weight to get to before they would do treatment. As of today, I’m about halfway there (35pounds down, 35 to go).

This morning I met with my regular endocrinologist who is helping with the weight loss and pregnancy preparation, she’s happy with my progress, but made it very clear that I mustn’t get pregnant while on these current drugs, so for the first time today I got reminded bout condoms like a teenager.

Then Mr Pops and I had lunch in the hospital canteen (a hot date if I ever had one). He was great company though, it’s a women’s hospital, so lots and lots of pregnant women, babies and small children everywhere, and I usually go by myself so it was great to have a buddy today.

After lunch, I had my appointment at the Reproductive Biology Unit with my fertility specialist. The main point was to have the mirena out, but as I hadn’t spoken with them for 6 months and I’d done lots of reading, visiting specialists and making plans, I wanted to hear her thoughts on what our next steps were. I already knew that I was in for a repeat hysteroscopy and D&C in January (likely 29th) and then wait for results before we get the go ahead, assuming they are all clear I thought that we would go straight to IVF, but she was thinking that I should be able to do TI with Clomid (again, that’s what made my diagnosis apparent in the first place, so I’m struggling a little with that thought, although I do know it wasn’t the cause, just the catalyst). As I left this appointment I was again reminded not to get pregnant, and to use condoms, it is so weird to hear when that is the exact opposite reason I am seeing you people! 


Things I need to consider:

- I am taking weight loss drugs, which, along with exercise and my gastric band, are actually working, but the drugs mean that I’m not allowed to get pregnant and with 35pounds to go before I’m even in the ‘overweight’ BMI category, I am reluctant to stop them yet. 

- But if I give myself the time to lose weight, I might give the hyperplasia time to grow back, so she wants me back on the mirena if I decide to go this route, she can do this at the same time as hysteroscopy, phew, that bugger hurt last time! I’m not allowed to do oral progesterone though.

- I don’t really want to wait any longer than I have to to get the ball rolling on ART

- I don’t want to put me/potential baby at risk because I don’t want to wait to lose weight

- I don’t want to go through needless medical procedures (IVF) if I can help it

- IVF is nearly free, but TI is literally only the cost of Clomid

- I don’t want to put off IVF if TI isn’t going to work anyway, hasn’t so far/Clomid was a shitshow already

- I don’t know what my ovary reserve is like, but I have taken an AMH test today, so I’ll get that result in January so that will help with decision making

- I’ve asked husband to do a second SA, because his first one was fairly good, but I don’t want that to be a barrier/false sense of security/if he needs to work on anything might as well do it while we’re waiting anyway


So the FS, husband and I went through a whole lot of dependencies and what if’s and maybes and have come up with the following scenarios:

1. I get a bad result in January, and I can’t even think about that yet because it could include the cancer-word.

2. I get a good result in January, and I get to roll the dice... then what...

I think I want to do the Mirena at the hysteroscopy, just so I don’t have to be awake for that again, but I still need to decide TI or IVF, with all the pros and cons of each. I’ve written it all out, I’m sure I need to sleep on it, and I’ve got time to make a decision.

I just wish someone could tell me what to do and which would be safest, get me my baby soonest and look into that crystal ball for me and tell me it will be okay. I am so scared I’m going to choose the wrong way. My husband is great, he first of all said it’s up to me, but I told him he needs to help me make these decisions because it’s both of us, both of our lives, and he is on board now, but I’m still going to be doing the hard yards I think.",t2_934wdi6,False,,0,False,Decisions decisions,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_7l01nx,False,dark,0.99,,public,5,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1513786132.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Sorry about the novella, mostly for me, but any advice is welcome!!</p>
