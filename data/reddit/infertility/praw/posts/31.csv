That attitude changed earlier this year, when a huge adenomyoma was discovered in my uterus. The adenomyoma was removed, I was told to wait 6 months on my transfer and hope for the best.

Well, here I am six months later. I'd psyched myself up for weeks, telling myself *this* transfer is finally going to work. The big adenomyoma is gone, I did my 3-month Lupron Depot shot to help shrink the rest of the adenomyosis. My estrogen levels have been perfect. All systems go.

Then yesterday I went in for my ultrasound to check my lining, which was nice and thick (yay) and the ultrasound lady started acting weird and stopped talking. At the end of the U/S, she just said ""Well, we'll have them look it over and see what they think."" Great. That didn't sound encouraging.

Then I get a serious sit-down with one nurse who says I have small ""pockets"" or something in my uterus. ""Well, I *do* have adenomyosis,"" I said. ""Could those be adenomyomas?"" She quickly said that was probably what it was and would need to consult my RE (he was in surgery.) She left the room.

My brother married his wife a few years ago and they hoped to start a family shortly thereafter. They have since pursued a few years' worth of medical interventions, like lots of procedures, tests, IVF cycles, and are continuing to struggle. They are not yet pregnant and are continuing to pursue IVF.

I can't really say I know what they're going through from my personal experience, as I'm childfree by choice with my husband of several years. I don't talk to my brother much about their struggle, as he's very reserved and private about this sort of thing. My SIL, however, is much more public about her grief and anguish, so I know things are hard with both of them. I want to be supportive in a way that helps both of them.

So, my questions for you all: what can friends and family do to help you, especially in cases when we can't fully empathize? Any big no-nos (besides the obvious ""why don't you just adopt?"")? I worry about prying when he/she doesn't want to talk about it, but I also don't want them to think that I don't care about what they're going through.

PS: with respect to my SIL, I'm not super close with her, I don't know her all that well (we live on opposite coasts), and, in light of that, I don't want to inadvertently do or say something to offend her. In other words, I don't want to say something in a caring spirit but accidentally cause offense, but I also just don't know 100% of what is going to be offensive or triggering. I imagine that's a common issue with loved ones generally - good intentions, accidental fallout?

Anyway, I thank you all for any advice you have.

Okay, I need to take a deep breath before going into this. Sorry, this is gonna be long.

Last night my sister in law came over just to ""hang out"" we do that sometimes, but I knew why this time. She's also been struggling with infertility, about 2 years, 1 not try not preventing, and 1 kind of actively trying. She says, ""I'm nervous to tell you this."" I knew. I got really excited for her, asked her how she told her husband, etc. She couldn't stop thanking me. Last month I have her vitex and inositol powder that I'd bought for myself, but decided against. She's says because of me they were able to get pregnant. That makes me uncomfortable, but whatever.

She's pregnant. She's so pregnant. It's early, they just found out a few days ago. I'm nervous for them, I want it to stick so bad. 

Our husband's came over to my house (they work together) we both go outside and I hug my bro-in law and congratulate him. He can't stop smiling, he's so excited. He was hesitant about even getting pregnant, sometimes avoiding my sister in law when she wanted sex. This is what they needed, he realized he can be a Dad, and he can provide. I hope it works out.

When they left, I collapsed into a puddle of emotions. My husband kept saying it was okay, his voice heavy himself. I cried all night, and when it was time to sleep we both ended up holding each other sobbing. Reassuring each other it would be okay, our time would come. We're still on the right track, we're not giving up yet.

All I can think about is when they tell my in-laws and how happy they'll be, and how shitty Christmas will be with them opening presents for the baby, and the glances and hushed comments I'll stumble into because it's even more obvious who's infertile now.

I've mentioned here before I've had 20 friends get pregnant in the time we've been trying, 17 months. Now it's 21, and anyone else to get pregnant won't compare to the pain this brings me. I'm so happy for them, but I've never felt more gutted in my life.

31,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So today was the second opinion after the failed first IVF and not really liking what my RE is throwing my way throughout my treatment. The TL;DR of my history is lowish AMH (0.95) and AFC (~8-10), highish FSH (highest at 14), 3 failed IUIs (no stim, clomid, injection due to converting IVF to IUI). Antagonist protocol with no suppression or priming resulting in a dominant follicle and convert to IUI. My Dr wanted to do the same thing again.

New RE took a lot of time to talk me through my previous labs and went through what she would do based on my failed antagonist cycle. She did say she may have started there too, but wouldn't do it again.

What she thinks she would go with next would be to start me on BCP (check, I started last Thursday to prep for another antagonist), then do a long Lupron cycle to prevent the dominant follicle and get a good cohort of follicles growing together. She also said we could do estrogen priming with antagonist, but she thought the long agonist was a little better.

Pros: I like her so much more than current RE, I feel like she listened to me and cared about my case. I could theoretically jump ship and switch clinics and just continue on this cycle with them and the long agonist protocol.

Con: I like the staff at the current clinic and I'm not sure what their nurses are going to be like. The SART stats are better for current clinic than new one.

Neutral: Both clinics are in my town, so monitoring is easy and close. Both take my insurance.

I'm nervous about the long agonist over-suppressing, she said she didn't think that would be an issue. She is going to ask the other REs there what they would do and see if there are other thoughts, which is comforting.

I am coming back here. I really, really don't want to. But I'm thankful that there's such a wonderful community to come back to in the first place.

Our double-embryo FET was successful (after a failed IVF), tested positive 9/4. It was twins. We were measuring behind from our very first ultrasound, so I didn't get a lot of chances to truly enjoy being pregnant. Instead I had weeks of worrying and anxiety with a few spurts of happiness in between.  

Found out about 2 weeks ago that neither baby had a heartbeat. This was expected for Baby B based on one of our ultrasounds, but Baby A had a heartbeat a few days earlier so there was hope.

I had a D&C a week ago today. 

It's been a very hard couple of weeks. The absolute hardest thing was telling those that knew we were pregnant that we had lost the babies. It was just so hard to say the words.

I ended up telling my Dad we were pregnant and now we're not. He didn't know we were going through IVF or anything, and that was very difficult to say out loud to him. However, he was more supportive and loving and kind than I ever could have hoped for. Honestly, all of our friends and family (who knew) have been. Thank God for that.

I know we'll try again. We have 4 frozen embryos. But for now, I'm just getting through the D&C recovery (still bleeding quite heavily) and trying to move on. I'm still so pissed sometimes - I don't get to do the cute Halloween costume ideas I had. Or the Thanksgiving reveal I wanted. Or the perfect Christmas-time baby belly. Or, most of all, a child. Or two.

I ordered a necklace with 2 emeralds on it as a memento (May birthstone) - it sounds a bit morbid, but a friend of mine recommended this as it really helped her cope with her loss.

We had nothing to freeze, which was devastating but I won't go into that now. Ever since the transfer I have had serious bloating (feels like a fully inflated basketball in my abdomen) and little appetite. I suspected OHSS and started eating salty foods and drinking Gatorade as many on this thread have suggested. Two days ago, the bloat & no appetite continues and I start having shortness of breath when going for a non-strenuous walk. Then last night I wake up in the middle of the night with shortness of breath and needed to sit upright to fall back asleep. I call the RE today, go in for a visit and they tell me that yes, I do have OHSS and the reason I can't breathe is that I have fluid in my lungs. They run a bunch of bloodwork to see if I can safely go home or if I have to be checked into the hospital to have the fluid drained. After waiting at the RE office 1.5 hours for the bloodwork to come back, they tell me I am cleared to go home, but need to start taking another medication (Dostinex) and come back for monitoring again tomorrow. 

So now, on top of feeling like shit everyday, I have to take yet another daily IVF-related medication (synthroid, pre-natal vitamin and now Dostinex) in addition to the nightly PIO shots in the ass, AND I have to get up ass early for OHSS monitoring appointments that are a 45 minute drive from my house. And all the while, I still don't know whether the transfer successfully got me pregnant, so all this misery could end up being for nothing. 

This fucking sucks.

We had nothing to freeze, which was devastating but I won&#39;t go into that now. Ever since the transfer I have had serious bloating (feels like a fully inflated basketball in my abdomen) and little appetite. I suspected OHSS and started eating salty foods and drinking Gatorade as many on this thread have suggested. Two days ago, the bloat &amp; no appetite continues and I start having shortness of breath when going for a non-strenuous walk. Then last night I wake up in the middle of the night with shortness of breath and needed to sit upright to fall back asleep. I call the RE today, go in for a visit and they tell me that yes, I do have OHSS and the reason I can&#39;t breathe is that I have fluid in my lungs. They run a bunch of bloodwork to see if I can safely go home or if I have to be checked into the hospital to have the fluid drained. After waiting at the RE office 1.5 hours for the bloodwork to come back, they tell me I am cleared to go home, but need to start taking another medication (Dostinex) and come back for monitoring again tomorrow. </p>

<p>So now, on top of feeling like shit everyday, I have to take yet another daily IVF-related medication (synthroid, pre-natal vitamin and now Dostinex) in addition to the nightly PIO shots in the ass, AND I have to get up ass early for OHSS monitoring appointments that are a 45 minute drive from my house. And all the while, I still don&#39;t know whether the transfer successfully got me pregnant, so all this misery could end up being for nothing. </p>

<p>This fucking sucks. </p>

What he found says $6k lifetime & these IUIs or whatever. We are a straight to IVF couple. 

So my question: can anyone advise on how we can get this information? I know it sounds stupid (just call BCBS!), but they said there is no coverage. My husband mentioned the SPD & now there is but he has to talk to his employer for details (cue the secret HR doc he can only view in person).

Also we want to know how our decision to do IVF uninsured comes into play if we have any coverage on his insurance at all. Will they force us to do IUIs even though we will have been through 2 retrievals already? Would we be able to use the coverage on FETs & meds?

56,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"4 years ago, shortly after we married, we decided we weren't going to ""try"". What I mean by that is that we **were** trying, we just didn't want to force anything.  It would just happen, one day, and be a lovely surprise. 

It wasn't until half a year later that we decided we were ""officially trying"", and another half a year later, when I noticed small changes in my body - a little more hair on my upper lip, more pain during menstruation, sudden acne and oily skin - that I had a sudden, sharp suspicion that something was wrong.

But, I didn't really know how to express it. I got scared, and spent a month hunting for answers online and trying to figure out if it was really time to seek help. I wanted to be sure I wasn't complaining for nothing. Finally, I decided, perhaps foolishly, the answer was PCOS. Thinking I knew the answer made me feel a bit better. I made an appointment with an OBGYN and told him. He may as well have laughed in my face. ""You've been trying for *how* long? And you think you have *what*?"" I was nervous and didn't clarify that in total, it had been over a year. He started quizzing me on symptoms and I froze up.

I'm a shy person and I don't know how to stand up for myself. When he then asked if my symptoms were REALLY so serious, I stared at him blankly because the question surprised me. Why would I be here if I didn't think so? To add to the insult, he seemed to doubt if I was old enough to be sure I really wanted a child (I was 26). It was clear he thought I was a waste of time. Humiliation.

I chastened myself for trying to self-diagnose and blamed the encounter on that.. 
But the idea that something was wrong wouldn't go away. There were also the subtle jabs from my memory - during the 4 years before we married we had never been very careful. And yet, we never got pregnant. Was that coincidence? I didn't feel I could explain this idea in a way that didn't sound crazy, and I didn't know how to bring it up. I say too little in stressful situations because I become obsessed with how to say something ""appropriately"" or ""correctly"", so it comes off well, ie. Like a normal person... Well, it's obviously a major failure. I know this.

After that appointment, I was so discouraged and worried no one would ever take me seriously, that it took another whole year and a half to finally go to a fertility clinic. By that time I had a whole notebook of ovulation dates, temperatures - you name it. (Totally insane, and embarrassing in retrospect, and I'm pretty sure no one even glanced at it.)
After several appointments, my husband and I were still confused by the process. Instead of doing a whole lot of testing (just blood work, hysterosalpingogram and semen analysis which were all ok) the doctor was urging us to jump right into treatment (IUI). Nobody told us about ""unexplained infertility"" (the idea that you should be treated even if no one is sure what's wrong with you) or talked about how weird we should expect to feel. We aren't very emotionally ""showy"" people, so we didn't know how to put into words, even to each other, the foreign feelings related to the experience of someone telling you to just go ahead and have ""sex via proxy"" (IUI), and not give any reasons for why this is necessary. 

We found ourselves a year later,  having ignored the clomid prescriptions and IUI order, finally realizing that we were just scared and awkward, and those feelings are normal. The doctors were surprised when we came back, and questioned whether we really wanted kids. Again it was hard for me to figure out what to say.  I didn't realize until much later the difficulty behind the question. As intensely private people, we very much wanted a baby. But we also very much didn't want help, or even want to discuss this desire with anyone. There had never been a need to justify or put words to this need for privacy. And of course, there was the constant nagging hope that we'd never have to do anything, and that our ""problem"" would just solve itself if we kept waiting to act, one more month. Just one more month. 

But we were more afraid this second time, so we forced ourselves to go through with any recommendations, despite the obvious desire not to. And even if we didn't always understand why. The doctor identified 2 small polyps in my uterus. As far as I could tell there wasn't much solid justification in medical literature for treating infertility by hysteroscopy with polypectomy (and who wants to go through such a procedure for nothing - but admittedly,  I was most worried about the anesthesia since the risks of the procedure are actually pretty small).

This was my lowest point. I realized I would do anything to shift the blame of not being able to conceive away from my conscience. If I didn't do this surgery, my doctors and my husband might always believe this was the reason we couldn't have a child. And even I would not be able to dispel all doubt.

I stopped reading papers. I stopped analyzing risk. I decided to just pray, close my eyes, and do it. No more caution. It didn't feel great because my personality was completely at odds with my decision. But it was also a relief to have made any kind of decision that would appear to move us forward.

Of course, after the procedure, which was 4 months ago, there was a recurrence of that ""magical"" and stupid hope that we could do it on our own now.
But we made it to IUI number 2, just today. And I think I'm ready to admit it's not ""just going to happen"".

My nervous, excited wish is that I would get to be pregnant for the first time with my good friend, M, who does not yet have children, but I know wants to start trying soon. I think, somehow, if she also gets pregnant without me, my problems will seem so much more real. (Most of the time I only half believe something is wrong. My surgery is already just a blurry dream that I think I tried so hard to put out of my mind, it feels like an alternate version of me, someone who isn't really me, experienced it many decades ago. When someone asks if I've had surgery I usually don't even think of it.)

A little over a year ago, my best friend asked me ""when do you think you're going to start trying"" and I was distant and vague, like I'd never considered the possibility. Then she immediately got pregnant, and now they have a wonderful daughter that we love to ""aunt and uncle"". It would have been so fun to share pregnancy with her. Now, I don't want to talk to her about our problems because I love her and her new little family so much. I don't want her to think it makes me sad to be around them with their beautiful daughter - and it's actually opposite: I still feel so hopeful every time I get to hold a real, live baby. It's like a soothing therapy. Babies really DO happen!

Our other friends that live close by, adopted 3 children. They've hosted evenings encouraging others to adopt. I've thought about opening up to them since I know they struggled with infertility before adpption. But it seems emotionally  threatening and might also hurt them. I was open to the idea of adoption before I ever realized we were struggling to conceive. But that doesn't change our desire to make a real little person. 

It's been hard not telling anyone. But the thought of having to answer questions about success after our procedures seems even more unbearable. And I have no adequate response to pity. So it's been 4 years since we got excited about the idea of growing a little person. And we still haven't shared one bit of this weird struggle with a single living being. Hello to all!

As well, I have read a few things on the internet about the HSG procedure making you super fertile, has anyone heard or experienced this? 

Thank you in advance! 

UPDATED: So I went to get my HSG this morning, and it was an interesting experience. There were 5 other women there with me all getting the test done at the same time. 

I was expecting there to be some discomfort but there was a lot of pain! Pain when the catheter was inserIted and more pain when the dye was injected. My uterus started going into spasms almost immediately as well, and the procedure was also stopped. They weren't able to get enough pressure in my uterus to make the dye flow through my right tube, but the dye did go through my left tube. The test ended up being inconclusive because the dye didn't flow through my right tube due to lack of pressure inside my uterus. 

I certainly was in a lot of pain, so I drove home and go reacquainted with my couch and heat bag. 

I did take a prescription pain pill before the procedure and I don't even know if it worked. I also took an Ativan before the test, but I still ended up crying before and after the procedure.

The session included a pretty heavy duty sales pitch for PGS, the Counsyl testing or whatever, because blasts can look normal but be genetically abnormal?  

I guess, do abnormal embryos usually just arrest, and not develop any further, usually?  Or are there genetically abnormal embryos that make it to blast stage and look normal, too?

I'm really struggling with whether to even go forward or just be happy with the child I have.  I don't think my husband or I could stomach the idea of potentially destroying embryos that are genetically abnormal (Down syndrome, for instance) so what would the solution be there?  Frozen indefinitely?  Can you donate embryos that test positive for a trisomy?

Saturday and Sunday were mostly just stabbing abdominal pains and nausea. The Dr. also gave me a pill that has to be administered vaginally which led to the discovery that MY SHIT IS ALL FUCKED, like why did NO ONE mention that I'd be shedding a bunch of grotesque tissue and... matter from there? I thought I pulled out a sad, shriveled ovary. I thought I was dying. So I barfed the first night and have just dreaded it every night since.

Monday was more stabby pain and surprise special guest, back cramps? Whatever. Monday was the first day I went for the Tylenol 3. We're BFFs now.

Yesterday I thought I felt well enough to go back to work, but I changed my mind around 2:30 and went home for a FOUR HOUR NAP. It was great, but when I woke up I felt out of breath. As the night wore on, it didn't get better. I knew that was one of the symptoms of a bad case of OHSS, so I tried to just pretend it wasn't happening. I'm so clever.

This morning I woke up feeling like I had fallen off a ladder and couldn't catch my breath. The stabbing pains were gone, at least! I called the nurse, because she told me to let her know if I started having those kinds of symptoms, but even then I tried to play it down. She urged me to come to the clinic, which is a 45-minute drive away. I told my husband I was going and he insisted on leaving work to drive me there. 

Meanwhile, I haven't eaten anything because it feels like I'm full of water balloons, and I also don't want to get myself even more out of breath. We get to the clinic and they do an ultrasound wherein I get busted for not having eaten anything (""Oh honey, I can see your gall bladder! Make sure he feeds you after this!"" -- Yeah, husband! Quit starving me!). The doctor tells me he can either do another needle and drain some fluid, or we can try to wait it out, but it will definitely get a little worse before it gets better.

He left the room to give us a chance to discuss, but I immediately started crying because emotions are just very high and I super did not want another needle in my snizz. So we opted to ride this bloated train all the way down. I felt bad that husband dropped everything to carry me all the way to the clinic for basically a gooey looksee and nothing else of note.

I've gained 12 lbs in the past week, I cry a lot (though that does not seem to be helping decrease the fluid in my guts), and I am tired of whining to my husband even though he's been fantastic through all of it. I just want to take full breaths and wear pants again.

Thanks for letting me whine.

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~

UPDATE 10/21: Still miserable. Gained another pound overnight, bringing the grand total poundage to 13 for the week (adios, pantalones). Embryologist called and we have a grand total of three viable blasts to send off for testing.

Three.

I feel excited but also disappointed. That's not a lot of room for error. I don't know what I'd do if I had to do another stim cycle. Were my hopes too high? We had 18 fertilized eggs on Sunday. I really thought we could get at least 4-6 for testing and that maybe 3 of those would be our kids. 

Does anyone have any advice or experience to share? What are the chances that all three of these embryos are going to pass testing? Am I asking the wrong question? I feel as emotionally deflated as I wish I physically was.

This was my 3rd month on Clomid and decided to try an IUI along with it. Had one 20mm follicle and one 18mm follicle along with several other 15mm. Lining looked good at 9mm according to RE. This was at an ultrasound Sunday at 930 am.  Brought my OPK which had just shown positive also that morning. He said they'd book the IUI for Monday.

About 12pm I stared getting pretty major cramping from what must have been ovulation. The LH surge was gone by 3pm when I took another OPK.

Clinic calls and says my IUI is set for 3pm the next day. I tell her I'm ovulating as we speak and won't that be too late since the egg only lasts 24hrs?  She says not to worry the my egg has a long journey down the tubes.

Next day at 3pm the RE comes in for the procedure and says I look scared. I tell him I'm just nervous we missed the window as its been about 28 hours since I ovulated. He brushes it off and says not to worry.

I've been thinking about it for the past 48 hrs and I'm pissed. Not only did I go through the side effects of clomid once again, i went to accupuncture and the $450 iui cost.  We are in it for about $600 this month. Not to mention I only have one clomid prescription left.

Am I just emotional or does anyone else think they totally fucked up the timing? I should have been moved to 9am after I told them I was ovulating right then. If there's one thing everyone seems to agree on its that the egg lasts a max of 25 hours right?

I've been a card carrying member of r/ttcafterloss since May 2015, when I had my first miscarriage. Since then I've had another MC and two CPs. And still no baby. Sigh. I have been a large contributor over there, but...I see new people come and go so often and so quickly. It's getting to be a bit much for me and I am likely taking a step back from the sub.

I have been seeing a RE for a few months and have had a complete Repeat Loss Panel done and they found next to nothing -- some low progesterone on some cycles, which likely caused my CPs. But no doctor thinks my 2 MCs were due to progesterone since they were later on.

Due to the low progesterone, and my early O'ing (cd12, consistently), the doctors do think I'm ovulating immature eggs. So I took my first round of Femara last cycle...and thats when I had my last CP. That cycle's CD21 testing showed a progesterone of 7.3 -- super low for even an unmedicated cycle, but the highest number I've seen! 

So I'm switching to Clomid in November...hoping for some great eggs and lots of progesterone and obviously a pregnancy. RE says if Clomid doesn't work, we'll start injections. So we'll see where all of this takes me. But I have little hope left and am feeling lost. I'm sick of the TTC ups and downs...of watching all my friends and family have babies while I just keep experiencing loss.

As for outside of TTC...I'm 32, been married for 3+ years (together for 7)...we love hiking, camping, cycling, and our pups. We're remodeling our house and its stressful and time consuming and I'm sick of it...but we're really getting close and our changes look amazing.

After struggling with infertility myself before getting pregnant last year with my now 7 month old baby girl.. my friend is now going thru TTC however after failed IUIs they are now looking into IVF. I want to be supportive but feel like I never say the right thing. I try to keep her positive while acknowledging the struggle and emotional difficulty in the whole process. 

What are some things you wish your friends would do/say to you to help you thru the difficult times and what are some of the worst things a friend with a child can say?

I've been trying for over 2 years, have been open about my ""journey"" to a group of online friends. I've only done TI and IUI, not IVF. 

About a year ago a friend decides she wants a baby, finds out that she has full IVF coverage (as if that isn't lucky enough) and goes for it. She's pregnant after her first round. 

So one of these online friends suggest we all throw her an online shower for her. I ask ""why her specifically"" as other people have had babies and didn't get a shower and even another girl did IVF and didn't get a shower. Why do it if it might make people feel left out or look like assholes if they don't want to participate (see where this is going?) 

She gives a decent answer, though I suspect part is because ""oh poor Her had to do IVF"". Then another girl chimes in with ""she's had such a long journey and has been so honest and open about it and I think it should be celebrated."" 

Well, fucking congrats to her! So she gets a baby, a party and apparently friends that care and I'm still just over here, like ""Oh, I guess my two year journey of weekly twat windings and blood draws and money down the drain and a ruined sex life and fights with my husband and NOT HAVING THE ONLY THING I EVER WANTED IN LIFE was just....made up? For fun? Or what?"" 

I GET that it's easier to celebrate success than it apparently is to mourn a loss, but fucking Christ! Like how can you be so brazen to say that TO THE PERSON THAT HAS FAILED. 

In all honesty, I want to flounce. I want to tell them all to fuck off and that I hope they never experience the pain of not having the ONLY THING THEY'VE EVER WANTED. 
But I'm also not sure I'm ready to not have them as friends. And it's not like I can fault the IVF girl. I mean, great for her, right? It's not a contest. This isn't about me.

I&#39;ve been trying for over 2 years, have been open about my &quot;journey&quot; to a group of online friends. I&#39;ve only done TI and IUI, not IVF. </p>

<p>About a year ago a friend decides she wants a baby, finds out that she has full IVF coverage (as if that isn&#39;t lucky enough) and goes for it. She&#39;s pregnant after her first round. </p>

<p>So one of these online friends suggest we all throw her an online shower for her. I ask &quot;why her specifically&quot; as other people have had babies and didn&#39;t get a shower and even another girl did IVF and didn&#39;t get a shower. Why do it if it might make people feel left out or look like assholes if they don&#39;t want to participate (see where this is going?) </p>

<p>She gives a decent answer, though I suspect part is because &quot;oh poor Her had to do IVF&quot;. Then another girl chimes in with &quot;she&#39;s had such a long journey and has been so honest and open about it and I think it should be celebrated.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, fucking congrats to her! So she gets a baby, a party and apparently friends that care and I&#39;m still just over here, like &quot;Oh, I guess my two year journey of weekly twat windings and blood draws and money down the drain and a ruined sex life and fights with my husband and NOT HAVING THE ONLY THING I EVER WANTED IN LIFE was just....made up? For fun? Or what?&quot; </p>

<p>I GET that it&#39;s easier to celebrate success than it apparently is to mourn a loss, but fucking Christ! Like how can you be so brazen to say that TO THE PERSON THAT HAS FAILED. </p>

<p>In all honesty, I want to flounce. I want to tell them all to fuck off and that I hope they never experience the pain of not having the ONLY THING THEY&#39;VE EVER WANTED. 
But I&#39;m also not sure I&#39;m ready to not have them as friends. And it&#39;s not like I can fault the IVF girl. I mean, great for her, right? It&#39;s not a contest. This isn&#39;t about me. </p>

<p>But, fuck. I&#39;m reeling right now.

She calls to tell me that my brother (he and SIL are expecting #1) just found out, 8 days ago, he has a 10-year old child from a previous relationship. Apparently, he always thought the child was his, but his attorney could never get confirmation because the child was in custody of the mother's parents and they always denied his requests. Or something, I'm not entirely sure. So, fun. I actually teared up with, I think, happy tears for him. He finally knows for sure. I'm also so sad for the decade he's missed. 

Then, my mom starts laying in about how my SIL won't let anyone post on facebook about the child yet. SIL is being a bitch; SIL is horrible to your brother, etc. Now, I don't know my brother that well because I was adopted out which was [NOT FUN](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/55owh4/taking_a_break_talk_of_abuse_cf_life_looooong/). So, I don't know SIL all that well. She's gorgeous and is always very nice. When they came over for dinner the other night because they were in-town, she didn't even talk about her pregnancy at all because she knows I'm a Barren Bitch. I thought that was nice. 

But, how the fuck would you feel about finding out your spouse has a 10-year-old, assuming you were not struggling with infertility, but were in-fact pregnant with your first? I'd be all over the place! Wouldn't you be angry, at least a little? Wouldn't you need *time to process this shit?!* Now, according to my mother (she's a real [piece of work](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4aysej/i_hate_my_biological_mother/)) my brother disclosed all of this before they got engaged. Only now is it official with the DNA results.

This is a hard situation I know because to everyone, it's great news. But to SIL this is horrible. I get that. But when I told my mom to give her some space, to give them time, she said that SIL wouldn't let brother be happy about it so he left to stay with her a few days. Ugh. So, now I'm the enemy ""blaming everything"" on my mom because my brother married a bitch and I can't see that. Sheesh. Marriage is hard enough with your MIL talking shit. She was just saying some really, really horrible shit about SIL. I mean, even if it is all true (which it's not because according to mom, brother is perfect and SIL a horrible wort-faced bitch to him, no one is perfect) it's NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS! BUTT THE FUCK OUT!

I also said it makes perfect sense to me they don't want anyone talking about it on facebook. It's HIS kid, he should be the one to tell the world. I would hope that he and his wife will figure out a way to tell people and how to make peace with all of this. But no, saying that was me siding with the bitch again because ""she just wants to share pictures of her grandbaby!"" Ugh, the whole grandparent thing really just irritates me. Mom went on to say ""my feelings don't matter, I'm just the grand parent"" NO YOUR FEELINGS DO MATTER BUT YOU ARE NOT THE FUCKING PARENT! YOU HAD 5 KIDS AND ONLY RAISED 2 OF THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE A SHITTY PERSON!

Then, she tells me brother and SIL are going to name the baby a name that was/is #2 on our list of girl names back when we thought about stupid things like names instead of twandings and follicles and AMH's and Menopur and cash down the fucking drain.

She tells me my FSH is high (14), my AFC is <10 (I never got that number from her), she also didn't ever tell me my E2 level today. She says since my AFC is low and FSH is high, RE doesn't want to do the BCP suppression because I'll be oversuppressed. So I'll just start stims again with my next period.

For reference, this is the exact same thing we did before the last IVF that converted to IUI because I had one dominant follicle after just 3 days of stims, I was only on CD6 total. I ovulate early every month, my FSH has been high, my AFC is almost always <10, they have 7 months of tests on me to verify all of this. I have DOR and dominant follicle is going to be a problem, whether my RE tells me this or not.

So I basically tell her that I'm not doing the same thing, that I've read and talked to other people (you lovely people) about doing priming, estrogen priming, micro-dose Lupron, pretty much anything besides a natural start to prevent this.

She said she go talk to the RE again about it and be sure he understands that I don't want to do this without some priming. I'm so frustrated. Perhaps it's time for the second opinion after all.

Edit to update: I heard back from my nurse this evening, the RE agreed to do low-dose BCP for 3 weeks before. I'll start that on Thursday to time my cycle where I won't need monitoring for a couple of days I'll be at a work meeting that I can't miss.

Today was the day a reproductive endocrinologist told me to TTC now, but we're not ready and we won't be for at least another 2 years. 

So, firstly I don't think this is exactly a case of ""I have PCOS so the doctor made generalizations about my (lack of) fertility so woe is me."" I have current labs indicating fertility problems. I had doctor confirmed infertility for 5 years because I had no period and awful hormonal imbalances, and for 2 of those years I stupidly always had unprotected sex (with a different SO). Now with some weight loss and metformin, I get my period and before I started the progesterone only pill to treat PMS, I had a few maybe positive OPKs. 

I'm 25 years old. I was diagnosed with significant polycystic ovary syndrome when I was 15. I have the hypoplastic breasts and carry most of my weight in my midsection. My sister is exactly the same. My mother had a history of PCOS-related infertility (5 miscarriages) but she never struggled much with her weight nor has hypoplastic breasts or the classic PCOS belly. I was diagnosed as likely either a carrier for non-classical adrenal hyperplasia or I have a more mild form of it based upon my ACTH test and other things such as developing significant pubic hair growth at the age of 5 and having a larger than average clitoris. My hormones were so fucked that the endocrinologist thought that I must have had a tumor on my adrenal gland or ovaries. (I didn't.)

I have a new endocrinologist who is also a RE endocrinologist. He strongly advised not waiting more than a year to start trying to conceive because I should have my first child by 30 for my own health reasons (and obvious fertility reasons). I told him our realistic timeline for TTC and he said, ""No, that's a problem. Preferably start now but no more than a year from now because things are likely going to get more difficult.""

My previous endocrinologist said the same. 

The problem is that my fiancé and I are in no position to start trying for a child. We're having bureaucratic problems (not of anyone's fault) impeding our marriage (and I don't mean we can't afford a lavish wedding, I mean we're struggling for a marriage license etc.) and financial security, but because my family loves him so dearly, they're attempting to help us financially through this bureaucratic nightmare. 

When it's all done and said, we'll be lucky to be in the position to (responsibly) TTC 2 years from now. My academic career fell through and now I'm stuck at home caring for my mentally infirm and physically fragile grandmother pretty much 24/7 who would otherwise be in a nursing home. I'm losing my health insurance next year because I'm legally unemployed and too old to use my mother's insurance. 

My fiancé and I have to pull ourselves together in so many ways before we can even start this journey together of trying for a child. We can't just start trying because on the off chance we conceive, we're not at all prepared to have a child. 

Also, not that adoption is at all a remedy for infertility, but I don't think we could ever take that journey given that I have a significant mental health history including many mandatory hospitalizations and a misdemeanor for aggravated disorderly conduct during a mental breakdown. 

The lab fucked up my blood work today and I (unintentionally) curtly dismissed the technicians and probably stormed out because the tears were starting as the woman standing next to me held her sobbing baby in my ear. I booked it to the bathroom to cry. Then, I spent too long crying in the car with the A/C on when I thought the engine was running but it wasn't, so my car battery was dead. 

I should get my shit together because I probably have a long road ahead. No more crying in the hospital bathroom, I guess. 

Also, would-have-been SIL (my age) died unexpectedly this spring and I'm marrying the oldest son (30 years old), so future MIL wants marriage and grandbabies yesterday. 
At least my fiancé knows exactly what's up and that's what matters, although I feel like an asshole for dragging the man I love through my shitty fertility problems.

 I hang around /r/pcos but they're really starting to annoy me. Mostly women complaining about the hair on their faces, drinking herbal teas, or that they were diagnosed that day. I'm over it. 

So, feeling pretty shitty. Not sure where to turn. My therapist/psychologist gets that I'm grieving over my feminine shortcomings, but he's a guy who in his early 40s married a woman in her late 30s and very quickly had 2 kids, so I feel like he doesn't completely get it. ",t2_127ays,False,,0,False,"I'm not sure if I officially belong here yet, but I'm struggling.",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_581ahy,False,dark,0.94,,public,14,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,14,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1476784378.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><strong>Firstly, posting from a throwaway for privacy reasons and because I don&#39;t want to be that insensitive asshole who posts in an infertility sub when she hasn&#39;t had infertility treatments yet.</strong> </p>

<p>Today was the day a reproductive endocrinologist told me to TTC now, but we&#39;re not ready and we won&#39;t be for at least another 2 years. </p>

<p>So, firstly I don&#39;t think this is exactly a case of &quot;I have PCOS so the doctor made generalizations about my (lack of) fertility so woe is me.&quot; I have current labs indicating fertility problems. I had doctor confirmed infertility for 5 years because I had no period and awful hormonal imbalances, and for 2 of those years I stupidly always had unprotected sex (with a different SO). Now with some weight loss and metformin, I get my period and before I started the progesterone only pill to treat PMS, I had a few maybe positive OPKs. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 25 years old. I was diagnosed with significant polycystic ovary syndrome when I was 15. I have the hypoplastic breasts and carry most of my weight in my midsection. My sister is exactly the same. My mother had a history of PCOS-related infertility (5 miscarriages) but she never struggled much with her weight nor has hypoplastic breasts or the classic PCOS belly. I was diagnosed as likely either a carrier for non-classical adrenal hyperplasia or I have a more mild form of it based upon my ACTH test and other things such as developing significant pubic hair growth at the age of 5 and having a larger than average clitoris. My hormones were so fucked that the endocrinologist thought that I must have had a tumor on my adrenal gland or ovaries. (I didn&#39;t.)</p>

<p>I have a new endocrinologist who is also a RE endocrinologist. He strongly advised not waiting more than a year to start trying to conceive because I should have my first child by 30 for my own health reasons (and obvious fertility reasons). I told him our realistic timeline for TTC and he said, &quot;No, that&#39;s a problem. Preferably start now but no more than a year from now because things are likely going to get more difficult.&quot;</p>

<p>My previous endocrinologist said the same. </p>

<p>The problem is that my fiancé and I are in no position to start trying for a child. We&#39;re having bureaucratic problems (not of anyone&#39;s fault) impeding our marriage (and I don&#39;t mean we can&#39;t afford a lavish wedding, I mean we&#39;re struggling for a marriage license etc.) and financial security, but because my family loves him so dearly, they&#39;re attempting to help us financially through this bureaucratic nightmare. </p>

<p>When it&#39;s all done and said, we&#39;ll be lucky to be in the position to (responsibly) TTC 2 years from now. My academic career fell through and now I&#39;m stuck at home caring for my mentally infirm and physically fragile grandmother pretty much 24/7 who would otherwise be in a nursing home. I&#39;m losing my health insurance next year because I&#39;m legally unemployed and too old to use my mother&#39;s insurance. </p>

<p>My fiancé and I have to pull ourselves together in so many ways before we can even start this journey together of trying for a child. We can&#39;t just start trying because on the off chance we conceive, we&#39;re not at all prepared to have a child. </p>

<p>Also, not that adoption is at all a remedy for infertility, but I don&#39;t think we could ever take that journey given that I have a significant mental health history including many mandatory hospitalizations and a misdemeanor for aggravated disorderly conduct during a mental breakdown. </p>

<p>The lab fucked up my blood work today and I (unintentionally) curtly dismissed the technicians and probably stormed out because the tears were starting as the woman standing next to me held her sobbing baby in my ear. I booked it to the bathroom to cry. Then, I spent too long crying in the car with the A/C on when I thought the engine was running but it wasn&#39;t, so my car battery was dead. </p>

<p>I should get my shit together because I probably have a long road ahead. No more crying in the hospital bathroom, I guess. </p>

<p>Also, would-have-been SIL (my age) died unexpectedly this spring and I&#39;m marrying the oldest son (30 years old), so future MIL wants marriage and grandbabies yesterday. 
At least my fiancé knows exactly what&#39;s up and that&#39;s what matters, although I feel like an asshole for dragging the man I love through my shitty fertility problems.</p>

<p>I hang around <a href=""/r/pcos"">/r/pcos</a> but they&#39;re really starting to annoy me. Mostly women complaining about the hair on their faces, drinking herbal teas, or that they were diagnosed that day. I&#39;m over it. </p>

<p>So, feeling pretty shitty. Not sure where to turn. My therapist/psychologist gets that I&#39;m grieving over my feminine shortcomings, but he&#39;s a guy who in his early 40s married a woman in her late 30s and very quickly had 2 kids, so I feel like he doesn&#39;t completely get it. </p>

This last cycle was somewhat of a marathon. The first two IUIs I was on 2.5mg of Letrozole and got a solo follicle each time with relative ease. I believe I had IUI on CD15 for #1 and CD18 for #2. This time, cycle 3, I didn't show any response to the same dosage of meds by CD15, so my RE had me ""re-do"" them starting that night with a higher dose, 5mg. So CD15-CD20 was another round of meds, and at CD29 I finally had a 22mm follicle, with IUI on CD31. 

When I got the call with the negative results this afternoon the nurse said ""Ok so just give me a call when you start your period and we can get your prescription called in and schedule your day 3 ultrasound"" .... 

I was fully expecting something like ""ok lets get you scheduled for a follow up appt with the Dr."" because I thought 3 was kind of the ""magic"" number for IUIs before you talk about moving on, or at least changing protocol? When I asked her again she said ""Well, we wouldn't do more then 6 IUIs... You take some time to think about it"" and that was it. 

She did say it would be 5mg from the start this time, which I guess is ok, but when I pressed she also offered that I could take a month off and come in and talk to the Doctor. I really don't want to take a month off. We have been actively trying since last July. I started clomid cycles unmonitored-ish with my OB in January, and IUIs with the RE in June. I was convinced I would be pregnant by Christmas, because at every turn we have been told that we should have soo much hope! We are so young (hes 27, I'm 28), my husband's numbers are fabulous, your main problem is anovulation & that is the easiest thing to correct, etc etc etc

So now I'm really starting to worry, and I guess I do want to move on to IVF sooner then later, but I don't know if I am skipping steps. The doctor seems unconcerned, so am I stressing out for no reason? Should I do another IUI and potentially waste $500 on it? I have PCOS and do not ovulate on my own, which is my only known fertility issue. Does 3 failed IUI mean I have an egg quality issue, or could it just be really bad luck? Would doing an IUI with injectables cycle lead to better odds? Am I getting resistant to the meds? If I take this month ""off"" and am able to get an appointment to discuss IVF sooner then later, is there any chance I can get the cycle completed before the end of the year? The arbitrary Christmas goal is one thing, but fertility treatment thankfully counts towards our out of pocket max for insurance so if we could get it done before the end of the year, it would only be about $2k vs $5k plus if we do it early next year.

 http://www.littlethings.com/dog-owners-are-not-parents/

This mombie is very upset that she has been ""earning her stripes"" as a REAL mother while pet owners dare to call their pets their ""babies"". 

Now, I'm not a huge fan of being overly cutesy about my pets and I don't refer to myself as their ""mommy"", but if someone else does, fine with me. I love my pets and they bring me a lot of joy.  

I can completely relate to an earlier post today about hopefully having a child to be BFFs with our 5-year-old lab. (Though I suspect the cat might not be impressed with a kid. He will get extra catnip to buy his love.) They make us happy and we make them happy. In fact, post-mc I went out and got my pup an expensive orthopedic memory foam mattress with cooling gel because it made me feel better, dammit.

This article is exactly what drives me crazy about some people I know with kids. They act as though we must all stop and take a moment to think about the horrendous struggle they have raising the children they CHOSE to have and give them a massive pat on the back! Because nobody has ever raised a child before! We just don't understaaaaaand!

<p>This mombie is very upset that she has been &quot;earning her stripes&quot; as a REAL mother while pet owners dare to call their pets their &quot;babies&quot;. </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not a huge fan of being overly cutesy about my pets and I don&#39;t refer to myself as their &quot;mommy&quot;, but if someone else does, fine with me. I love my pets and they bring me a lot of joy.  </p>

<p>I can completely relate to an earlier post today about hopefully having a child to be BFFs with our 5-year-old lab. (Though I suspect the cat might not be impressed with a kid. He will get extra catnip to buy his love.) They make us happy and we make them happy. In fact, post-mc I went out and got my pup an expensive orthopedic memory foam mattress with cooling gel because it made me feel better, dammit.</p>

<p>This article is exactly what drives me crazy about some people I know with kids. They act as though we must all stop and take a moment to think about the horrendous struggle they have raising the children they CHOSE to have and give them a massive pat on the back! Because nobody has ever raised a child before! We just don&#39;t understaaaaaand!</p>

164,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"This is what I posted this morning (replaced husband's name w/ SO):


Today's date, October 15th, holds a very new meaning for me this year. It is National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day, and although I rarely share anything personal on Facebook, I have decided that it's the perfect time to tell you all my story.

Today, after 3 years of battling infertility, I should have been 12 weeks pregnant. I was supposed to be planning a cutesy announcement to tell you all that SO and I were happily expecting a baby in April. But sadly, 12 very painful days ago, I found out that I had miscarried and that this journey would only be getting more difficult.

Some of you may already know this, but SO and I have been trying to conceive for nearly 3 years. In 2013 we built our house with plenty of space for a family, and were SO excited to start trying once we got settled in. It never really occurred to us that it would take more than a couple of months.

About 8 months after we started trying, I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, which makes it nearly impossible for me to ovulate. I started taking some medicine that was supposed to help, and we continued on. Several months and a few invasive tests later I was put on a fertility drug called Clomid, which gave me plenty of horrible side effects (intense hot-flashes, anyone?) but after 5 miserable cycles, I was still not pregnant. Last August, we finally decided to consult with a fertility specialist, who told us that we would likely never conceive without In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). We were devastated at the expense, but at least we knew that we had a plan. I was scared to go through all of the tests, the hormones, the daily injections, and the constant stream of doctors appointments, but we knew that it would all be worth it in the end. In February of this year I underwent a painful egg-retrieval procedure so that we could start the IVF process, and in May we transferred 2 frozen embryos. We were convinced that it would work...but it didn't. It was hard knowing that even this level of medical intervention could fail, but saw it as a sort of trial run for next time. We took a bit of time off this summer, but I started again with the injections, hormones, etc. in preparation for our 2nd frozen embryo transfer this past August. We just KNEW that our 2nd round would work, and I even did extra things such as acupuncture to boost my chances. At the end of August, we were elated to find out that the transfer had worked, and we were officially 4 weeks pregnant! After the crappy journey that had taken us here, we both knew we needed to be cautiously optimistic, but the fears died down after we heard a healthy heartbeat, and we began to really dream of the future for this child. I started thinking about a registry, was excitedly looking up nursery decor, and we even put a deposit down on a daycare. Everything was finally on track!

The morning of October 3rd, at a routine ultrasound, four words changed my world forever. ""There is no heartbeat."" Four words, and everything SO and I had dreamed of, everything we had gone through these past months, was all for nothing. At ten weeks, our baby had died. Sitting there in the doctors office, listening to options, and walking out into a waiting room full of blissfully pregnant women was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. I had a surgical procedure the next morning, and just like that, I was no longer pregnant.

I wanted to share this story with you all, not for pity or prayers, but so that you hold your babies a little closer tonight and think about what this horrible day represents. I want this story to make you thankful for the sleepless nights up with your kids, for the dirty diapers and the cancelled plans. Because there are people out there who would do anything to stay up late holding a crying baby, instead of staying up all night crying for the baby they will never get to hold.

I wanted to share this story so that you would think twice when you ask someone why they haven't had kids yet, or ask when they plan to start trying. It hurts when you ache to be a mother with your entire being and some stranger won't stop pestering you about your biological clock, or tells you how selfish it is to be childless. I want you to realize that a mother of a toddler may desperately WANT to give her child a sibling but simply cannot (secondary infertility exists too). I want you to realize that it's not always that easy. Trying to make a baby is not always fun. No amount of ""just relaxing"" will give an infertile woman a child when even miraculous medical intervention has failed. Even the most innocent questions can cause a tremendous amount of pain for someone struggling with losses or infertility.

Statistically, 1 in 4 pregnancies will end in a loss. For some reason, people tend to sweep these losses under the rug, hide their pain and their stories as if they were in some way taboo. But I want to break the silence and start a conversation. 1 in 8 women in the US suffer from infertility, and yet most of us never speak out about our condition, afraid that our stories might be viewed as shameful. Afraid of being perceived as flawed. But I personally believe that suffering in silence is unnecessary, and feel that the support I've gotten during my struggle has been priceless.

I know that our loss happened relatively early, and I'm sure it cannot compare in pain to stillbirth, infant death, or even later-term losses. But this baby was real to us, and so very loved and wanted. This journey has taught us both a great deal about ourselves, about our marriage, and about our respective internal strengths. SO has been an amazing support system throughout all of this, learning to give me shots, and helping me cope with the physical and emotional side effects of the process. His dedication and empathy have made me hope, more than ever, that he will finally get to become a father someday soon.

We will do another round of IVF in a while and hopefully it will all work out in the end...but I will always remember this pregnancy, and the baby that we never got to meet. I know that SO and I are young and healthy and that statistics are generally in our favor. But the journey sucks, and it's painful and overwhelming and outrageously expensive. I'm just hoping that sharing this will make things a little bit better...for myself, and for all the other couples out there struggling with this painful reality and the heartache it brings.

Late yesterday afternoon I had a bit of spotting.  I had been cramping for about 5 days, but I just figured it was gas pains and uterus growing.  At 6 weeks, 5 days, I went from spotting to heavy bleeding, to passing clots and tissue.  Off to the ER (it was after hours for my clinic, and they don't have any on call doctors outside of business hours).  After a really long uncomfortable pelvic exam and two ultrasounds, all signs of my pregnancy were gone.  It happened so quickly, I am still in shock and haven't really slept.

180,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband's friend (and one of his most trusted confidants in the whole IF journey) sent us a text yesterday that was meant to be supportive and I'm having a hard time sorting through my feelings about it. 

The text was a screenshot of a facebook post (already: oh boy here we go) that his sister made. His sister and her husband tried for kids for 5 years before deciding to see a doctor about it (sorry if that's any of you all but that's something I've never understood) and found out immediately that MFI was at play. They underwent one round of IVF, and from it successfully conceived and birthed a child. Our friend had shared his sister's story with us earlier this year, long before we had a DOR diagnosis or a failed IVF under our belt. Here was the post:

""Oct 11 2015 was egg retrieval and fertilization day. Exactly one year ago today the cells that have become my perfect, wiggly smiley baby were put together on a path where for me, the divine and the scientific intersected. I woke up from the anesthesia at about noon and as soon as I realized I was in the recovery area I had to let the tears out. I laid there in pain, with bruises and collapsed veins in my arms from all the blood they had taken from me the week leading up to that day, a tender abdomen with evidence of 20 or so needle pokes from the round of stimulation injections, once lime-sized ovaries that had quickly blown up to the size of grapefruits - creating a brutal fight for space in my lower back, an empty bank account, a mind filled with crippling fear and a heart full of nervous hope. 

Jimmy Fallon, who struggled with his wife for years to have children, said in a People magazine article about infertility, ""Do whatever you can. Don't quit. Whatever you can do, keep doing it. Because it's so worth it."" 

Thanks Jimmy. I wanted to quit. But thanks to those words in my head, a few loyal supporters and the most steadfast husband ever, I didn't. And you were right.""

The friend sent us this and said ""thought you guys would appreciate this post from my sister, but didn't want to tag you on FB""

My husband responded quickly with ""Definitely. Thanks for thinking of us. I had no idea about Jimmy Fallon, but I agree with his sentiment. One day, we will share our story.""

I, however, did not respond. My husband asks me in bed that night if I saw the text and why didn't I say anything. I was like, well fuck. Because I hated almost everything about this.

First, the things that I do like. I like that my husband's friend is thinking about us and shares things/stories that he finds comforting. I appreciate that she had to undergo IVF and that sucks.

Things I don't appreciate: 
The complaint about her swollen ovaries. Our friend knows that my body failed to respond whatsoever to stims and yielded only 1 non-viable egg. 
The talk about wanting to give up. You did one procedure and it worked the first fucking time. What are you even talking about.
The fact that everything you described as horrific is exactly what is supposed to happen. Horrific is when things don't go well and you don't wind up with any viable eggs, much less a live baby 9 months later.
The Jimmy Fallon quote. Dudes, I disagree with that completely. Some people do not need to do ""whatever you can do"" to get pregnant. Some people can't afford to financially or spiritually or emotionally. Not everyone will have success at the end of this journey, I don't need a fucking celebrity to tell me about how ""worth it"" it is to have a child.

I'm glad my husband is a sweet soul who completely missed all of this upon reading it and saw it simply as a token of support from his friend. But I could not and I think I did the best thing to just not respond to the text. If he only knew how much time I've spent being upset about this text he would probably feel terrible. I know he was just trying to help. I need you guys to remind me that my response isn't a crazy, shitty asshole response to have to this.

We finally found a place to do the HSG for $250 for a cash price! I was so excited when I found out since the fertility clinics in Seattle were charging almost 1,000 for it! I'm going in this afternoon to get my HSG, kind of nervous about the pain since I've heard mixed results on how bad it can be.  Going to take some Aleve before and brought some to take after.  Luckily I'm going in at 3pm so I can just go straight home afterwards and relax for awhile. 

We also have some other good news, I found a place about 30 minutes from us that does 2 IUI's for $2400 & the 3rd is free if the first 2 don't work.  The price covers everything (meds, ultrasounds, appts, etc) and is very reasonable.  Assuming our HSG comes back with no blocked tubes that is going to be our next step. I feel so much better to actually have a plan.  We're going to start saving money now and I'm hoping by January we'll have the money to pay for the 3 IUI's, so I really hope by early February we'll be getting our first IUI! If my tubes are blocked we've looked into a clinic in NYC (We're in Seattle) that does IVF for $3900 for a cycle.  This would still be cheaper if we got plane tickets, hotel, etc than the $18,000 most places are wanting around Seattle.  If tubes are blocked and IVF is our only choice then we will start saving for that I'm hoping next summer is when we could start IVF#1.  In the mean time I'm going to work on losing weight and will continue with medicated Femara cycles and timed intercourse and who knows, maybe we'll get an almost free baby in the mean time that doesn't miscarry, but I just feel really good to have an actual plan.

**EDIT: Here's what I just sent back to her:**

Hi! Wow, thank you so much the kind offer! That is incredibly sweet of you :) So… my infertility is because I’m basically running out of eggs. I have what’s called diminished ovarian reserve, or premature ovarian failure. It’s a genetic thing that somehow caused my ovaries to age faster than me, so my ovaries went through my egg supply too fast. My uterus is totally fine, though, so if I wanted to I can use donor eggs or embryos when I’m ready to have a baby (I’m hoping around 3-5 years from now, but there are 50 and 60 year old women who do this and are totally fine.) I rarely ovulate, and if I do, the doctors said the eggs would be so bad from being “old” that they won’t be viable to become an embryo. So that’s where I’m at. 

I did want to offer you some ideas though, if you are super into surrogacy - there’s some good info on this website (http://www.circlesurrogacy.com/surrogates/surrogates-requirements-faqs) about what surrogacy requires and all that comes with it. If you have questions, I can try and point you more in the right direction if you feel called to it!

We've been using an upstairs room as our office since we moved in with the plan that it will be the nursery any day.... About 2 weeks ago we moved the office downstairs to it's permanent room. I was in tears, I don't want this upstairs room, the nursery, sitting there empty everyday.

Today I was cleaning the last of the crap out of that room (I've been using it as a dumping ground). I've been thinking about what we do with this giant house if we don't end up having 3 kids/any kids. I decided as part of my plan b I want to ensure that each room still gets a use, gets decorated, cleaned, and lived in. I want to make sure that we still use this beautiful house even if it's not in the way I had originally dreamed about.

About 2 weeks ago we moved the office downstairs to it&#39;s permanent room. I was in tears, I don&#39;t want this upstairs room, the nursery, sitting there empty everyday.</p>

<p>Today I was cleaning the last of the crap out of that room (I&#39;ve been using it as a dumping ground). I&#39;ve been thinking about what we do with this giant house if we don&#39;t end up having 3 kids/any kids. I decided as part of my plan b I want to ensure that each room still gets a use, gets decorated, cleaned, and lived in. I want to make sure that we still use this beautiful house even if it&#39;s not in the way I had originally dreamed about.</p>

<p>Anyway, for me it helps working through some of this. The outcome I fear is a little less scary if I know what it might look like. I still hope I get to turn the upstair room into a nursery. But for now, it&#39;s a pretty sweet craft room with some killer views. And that&#39;s ok. </p>

If we still aren't getting numbers we need for PGS by Jan, we will be reevaluating if PGS is going to be a viable option any more and just take our chances without it, or if we just keep going for X more rounds before completely giving up on bio kids.

So, question. Has/did femara change the length of your luteal phase and/or did your luteal phase change every cycle while on it? 

My reason for asking is that before femara, i had varying luteal phase lenghts, as some of you who have seen my previous posts may know. My charted luteal phases have been 17 days, 8 days, 9 days, and 11 days. Every other cycle was anovulatory. This is now my third cycle of femara. Didn't ovulate the first time, next cycle I did. My luteal phase was 12 days. I'm now towards the end of 13 dpo. I have never, in my 16 years of menstruation, started my period at night. And i keep checking inside and I always get watery cervical mucus before my period. I have milky cm and no brown or red blood at all. I tested at 11 dpo-negative. I'm scared to test again.

Inspired by other redditors, and guided by the amazing u/PhillyGrrrl, my partner and I launched an advocacy campaign targeting our employer's insurance decision makers. We created some resources detailing why this insurance is so important, and detailed other competing universities who offered it. We mobilized our friends and alumni network to also target HR and the administration with this insurance ask. We met with HR several times and cleared up some misconceptions (our state does NOT have an infertility insurance mandate and this seems to confuse some people).  

I'm so fucking excited to share today that our employer will be officially including infertility coverage beginning Jan 1, 2017!!!! It's going to be a $15K lifetime max! Certainly not the best amount of coverage compared to other employers, but huge nonetheless for the over 20,000 employees who will be impacted :)

So fucking excited!!! And if anyone wants to try to get their employer to change insurance -- I can tell you that it was certainly much easier than I thought it would be. I mean, it took maybe 12 hours total of work? I'm happy to share resources with anyone who is interested in trying for this change at their employer!

<p>Inspired by other redditors, and guided by the amazing <a href=""/u/PhillyGrrrl"">u/PhillyGrrrl</a>, my partner and I launched an advocacy campaign targeting our employer&#39;s insurance decision makers. We created some resources detailing why this insurance is so important, and detailed other competing universities who offered it. We mobilized our friends and alumni network to also target HR and the administration with this insurance ask. We met with HR several times and cleared up some misconceptions (our state does NOT have an infertility insurance mandate and this seems to confuse some people).  </p>

1. Women With Four or More Kids 
A single child is understandable. Two is ok. Three is actually quite nice. But more than four is contributing to overpopulation.  What are you trying to do?  Show the world how fertile you are?

2. Pregnant Complainers
YOU CHOOSE THIS PATH-unless you are a rape victim.
Oh, you vomiting for hours on end?  You should have thought that through before you got pregnant.  Your feet are so swollen you can barely walk?  There are African tribal women who still carry water for miles and are pregnant and DON'T complain.  YOU - stop.  Not sleeping well? Well welcome to night shift life and crying each night because of your broken body.  And your other kid(s) is so demanding right now. And you look like you’re carrying triplets. I’m sure it sucks. Wanna trade? Here. Here’s my infertility. I’ll take your pregnancy complaints.

3. Unplanned “Oops”
You didn’t even try! No fair.  Don't complain to us.  Unless are you were raped.

4. The Pregnancy Expert
Each pregnant woman is different.  Just because it worked for you doesn't mean it will work for us.  And don't assume that we haven't considered everything possible.  We have.

5. The Woman Who Gets Pregnant Her First Try
I am so happy that your eggs and his sperm are super sperm and eggs.  Fine you are VERY fertile then.  Don't flaunt it.  

6. Teenage Moms
Honestly.  It is unfair that someone immature and unprepared can get pregnant so easily.  Be that as it may don't complain to us.  You should have had a solid birth control in place or else you are not ready to be having sexual relations yet.  I waiting until I had a stable job and marriage before I considered a child.  I could be a better mother than you ever could. 

7. Deadbeat Parents
Why did you have kids then.  You should know what you are getting yourself into.  I think pretty much everyone hates a deadbeat. But seriously, you don’t even deserve the title of parent. 

8. Women who claim they are infertile
When you ask how long they tried before they conceived, they reply with 3 months.  Seriously.  Have you been through pain for 4 plus years of trying, shots, negative tests, scans, blood draws, crying, and constant questions of when are you going to have kids?  

9. Baby Killers
Aside from the fact that you violated many laws any news or story of some heinous human being dumping their newborn in the dumpster, or flushing them down a drain, or throwing them out of a high-rise, don't deserve to reproduce.  If you have a baby that you don’t want, I WILL TAKE HIM/HER. No need for first degree murder, aggravated manslaughter, second degree murder, etc.

10. Yourself
Most of all you hate your own crappy body that doesn't work.  Even though you can be a tough non girly girl in real life, there is something about not being able to do the most basic feminine thing of creating life.  You begin to think that maybe your body won’t ever work. Or that maybe you’re just not meant to be a mother.
