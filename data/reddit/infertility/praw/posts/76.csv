Background: totally unexplained since I got my cycle back in 2016 after a year of post pill amenorrhea. This was my first clinical, and literally happened the cycle before we were signed up to begin stimming for IVF. 

It was Triploidy 70 and lab wasn’t able to discern whether it was Diandric (sperm) or Digynic (egg). Triploidy 69, XXX/XXY/XYY includes 3 copies of every chromosome and is represented in about 10% of all clinical losses or 1:1000 chance. She had an extra X chromosome on top of that. 

I had a hard time finding many mentions of triploidy in general on Reddit. The other things I learned (I think I read every research study mentioning it) are that it’s not related to maternal age in the same way Trisomy is. Also that a version with 70 is EXTREMELY rare, and not even really google-able, so like &lt;1:1000000. Of the largest triploidy study to date, with like 500+ cases, only one case had 70 chromosomes. 

My OB said she thinks it’s a fluke but due to the rarity and our history she recommends Karyotyping on us and probably IVF with PGS/PGD. Haven’t spoken to my RE yet but I know she wants me to start a cycle ASAP but
I told her I wanted to wait a month or two for my body to return to normal - still not down to 0 HCG and no cycle. The only other weird genetic thing I know I have is Homozygous MTHFR C677T which is often implicated in higher chance for losses but euploid / normal ones. 

Would love to hear from any others on this board who found out triploidy was the reason behind loss, please DM or reply.

I get that it's a different lab that doing it but to go from 1 million to 20 million is a big jump.  I also think 20 million is still low for trying naturally but seeing that gave me hope that maybe they would go up and we could. But then the latest one was 1 million again. I've attached them in date order.  

1st analysis at our initial IVF consult 3/2018 - we were shocked because he has a 13 year old son from his first marriage but then discovered he had a varicocele which I then discovered was very common in guys with secondary infertility. Had varicocele repair surgery 4/2018. 

Still no luck getting pregnant so 10/2018 we did the SA with swim up which is what they would do with IVF to see if we needed to do ICSI.  

SA from embryo fertilization 2/2019.  Then after 2 transfers failed we wanted to do one more SA before making sure we were going to do IVF again.  Last one 5/2019.  

About to start stims sunday but I just am so curious why the big difference in these numbers?!  I also wonder if his sperm might affect the number of embryos that make it to day 5/6 and quality?  Last time we had 7 eggs and 2 made it to transfer stage (one not the best quality). I was on a low med protocol because I was in a study - doctor's goal is 12-14 eggs this time.

Basically my husband and I have been trying to conceive for nearly 3 years. Along this journey, we’ve had a diagnosis of PCOS for me and slight MFI for him. We are meeting with a consultant at the end of this month to discuss IUI or IVF.

So anyway, with my PCOS I barely ovulate naturally at all. Without the help of clomid. 
I last ovulated in December of 2018. Fully confirmed with blood work and an ultrasound.

However, I’ve noticed that some months I will get what appears to be a period despite definitely not ovulating. 

4 days ago I started bleeding (definitely haven’t ovulated as usual) and id say the period is of a ‘normal’ consistency. It isn’t light or any different to how a regular ‘yes I’ve ovulated this month’ period would be. The only difference for me is that I don’t get cramps with these periods. I only get menstrual cramps following ovulation.

Is there any reason for this? Is this pretty standard/normal for a woman with PCOS?

Get him to agree to hormone treatment - estrogen and progesterone.

Get to the pharmacy, they have two faxed prescriptions for the same drugs with different timing and instructions from each Dr. I'm LIVID at this point.

Unexpained, but I have thin lining and haven't had fertile cervical mucus in years. We've tried estradiol and estrace, but both stop my follicles from growing. We tried high doses of leteozole, but I dont respond to it at all. 

My protocol has involved gonal f for the past 6ish cycles. Clomid, gonal, trigger, progestrone. My lining is usually around 5 at ovulation. I have never ever had more than 1 mature follicle (as in only one follicle bigger than 11mm per cycle). Up until last cycle. Last cycle I wasn't responding to my usual dose..100mg clomid 3-7, then 100iu gonal cd 8 up to trigger. My follicles were all very tiny. It appeared I was over-surpressed from doing 6 weeks of OCP due to cysts before this cycle. But then on CD like 17 they took off. I ended up with an 18mm, two 15mm, and two 14mm all on the same overy, and a 12mm on the other. Triggered a day and a half later. But my lining was only 4.9 and I cancled my IUI due to lining. I'm on CD 2 right now and I told my RE I wasnt doing anymore clomid because I had serious concerns about my lining. She agreed to a straight gonal f cycle but only wants me on 50iu a day. I feel like last cycle was a freak thing, especially since I had done the same protocol multiple times before always having an identical response up until last cycle. I haven't spoken directly to my RE (she's supposed to call me Monday) so everything has been through the nurses but they said she's concerned I'll over respond because of last cycle but it seems odd to cut my dose so much just because of how one cycle (after a month and a half on birth control) went. I just don't want to waste another cycle and all this money on nothing.

I scheduled an appointment with a new clinic (5.5 hours away) but the first appointment they have for new clients is in NOVEMBER. I can't mentally take taking six months off, so we're sticking with this RE until I switch clinics but it's just so frustrating. I don't want to just keep throwing money away on cycles when my lining just isn't thick enough. The thickest my lining has ever been in two years of treatments now is 7 at ovulation and that was once. The second thickest was 5.5. I'm sick of this. Physically sick of this. Now that I have this typed up I'm not even sure why I wrote it. I just wanted to get it out I guess. I just want ONE shot at getting pregnant with a normal lining.

An upvote says ""this is good advice,"" ""I'm entertained by what you said,"" ""this is good information that I've never heard before,"" etc.

Stand-alone posts *do* have their place here and don’t automatically warrant a downvote. A stand-alone post that creates discussion is always welcome (within our rules, obviously).

I will say this - I do not believe in banning abortion for situations related to rape, incest, or severe injury/death to the mother. But to all the pro-choice women claiming to be “ill-equipped” to parent - then why are you having sex in the first place? Beyond that, why not give the child up for an adoption to a family that perhaps has been trying desperately to do what you did “on accident”. The “mistake” you made. I promise you, someone like me would love and value that “mistake” more than you could ever know.
How wonderful it must be to be so confident in your conceiving abilities, that you can decide “meh, not this one”, and terminate. How wonderful.
Here sits a woman, exhausted and depressed, viewing her body as broken and defective. Wanting nothing more than to be a mother. To make her husband a father, her mother a grandmother, her sister and aunt... and the universe decided to disallow that dream for me, and give it to someone who sees a child as a burden. You’ll never know this pain. 
Please understand, I am fully aware of the entire abortion argument. I understand both sides... but I can never support pro-choice (barring reasons listed above). Choosing to terminate a life because it’s inconvenient for you - when I cannot even create one. I understand your choice, but do not agree, believe in, or respect it. 
Also, please do not deflect the argument to “look at all the poverty, unsupported kids, uneducated ones, etc... why don’t you focus on that?!?”. Don’t worry - I DO focus on that. I work everyday to make the world a better place for all. I’ve dedicate my entire education and life to it. But don’t try to minimize your choice by pointing out other worldly problems. That’s just a defense mechanism. You’re still choosing to end a life.  End of story. 
Feel free to comment, argue, whatever you want... Just know, I love and care for all humans - good, bad, broken, and unborn. We don’t all have to agree, and we don’t all have to impress our beliefs upon each other. My only point with this entire post is just to offer the perspective of those desperately longing to grow and hold their own child.

UPDATE: I’m not telling anyone what they CAN or CANNOT do. Please actually READ my post.

It fucking hurt. Trying not to burst into tears, I just said ""You shouldn't say things like that, you never know when someone might be having trouble getting pregnant and those kind of comments can really hurt."" His face just fell, and I could see he was aghast that he had said that. Later he came up to me and gave me a hug and just said ""I'm so sorry, I never thought about that. I will never joke about something like that again."" So I mean, he just didn't know. And he learned. And he was very compassionate after he realized what he did. He just wants a baby to love just like I do. It just flipping hurts and I need someone to understand and hug me while I sob my heart out.

Fairly new to reddit, brand new to this sub. 

Back story:
I married my wife, largely because I know she'll be a fantastic mother. She married me for the same reasons. We always knew we wanted children. We've been married about 4.5 years, and been trying to conceive for about 3. We have tried everything... monitoring cycles, eating better, supplements, cutting down on unhealthy and unnecessary foods and drinking, I quit smoking, etc. Within the last six months, we underwent four rounds of IUI, to the tune of about $3,000. Our insurance wouldn't cover more than that. I always felt like ""if/ when it's meant to happen it will happen"" but I slowly have watched my wife sink into depression and her mental state deteriorate as we try and fail over and over again. It has killed me to see her hurt so much. 

We discussed it, and decided that ""we are where we are"" and started considering IVF.

We started consulting with ORM in Portland, OR last month. The costs started rolling in quickly. We are set to do egg retrieval at the end of June, and of course have a long road ahead of us before that. The $18,722 was prepaid and just for the basics. There's still $5,000-$8,000 in meds, a couple grand for additional freezing, another couple grand if we opt for genetic testing of the embryos. 

We've always tried to be fiscally responsible, but we are preparing to drain our bank accounts and max out a couple credit cards to make this happen. 

I need reasurrance. Is this all worth it? Has anyone else gone through IVF? I just spent half an hour on the phone with my bank and ORM making this happen and there's so much more to come, not to mention the pains of procedures, needles, and testing. 

Im terrified. If we had been able to conceive naturally, I'd be elated... but now I am questioning everything. I love my wife, and know we would be great parents, and this all feels terribly unfair. 

Help me, reddit. 

Thanks for listening.

Edit: I don't want people to think I am asking ""is it worth it"" to have a kid... not really my intention. I know that if/when I have a little one in my arms finally that the journey won't matter.

I'm coming off a chemical pregnancy from FET #2, feeling heartbroken, but trying look forward. I've scoured /r/whatworkedforme, /r/infertilitybabies and read the ""Why my FET failed"" sticky.

Some background: IVF #1 resulted in 4 PGS normals.  Unexplained except for 1% morphology (normal other counts) and thin lining (6-7mm normally) noted since starting treatment. Had a hysteroscopy with a very small fibroid removal July 2018 before my 1st IUI, normal SIS afterwards. No autoimmune, clotting disorders, normal thyroid, normal PRL levels.  No family history of any of these conditions either.  Both blasts transferred so far were 5AA, hatching, of good quality, 95% post thaw.

FET #1 - medicated transfer, lining 6.8mm trilaminar, E2 ~2000s, negative

FET #2 (attempt 1) - delestrogen, lining got to 6.4mm trilaminar, E2 ~2000s, cancelled

FET #2 (attempt 2) - letrozole + FSH. Lining 6mm tri, Ended up overstimulating (17 follicles, E2 ~ 3000s), cancelled.

FET #2 (attempt 3) - letrozole + FSH, baby aspirin, lining 7.5mm, E2 ~500, transferred, and resulted in chemical pregnancy (initial beta 11dp5dt = 144). 

My RE's suggestion is to repeat the same protocol since I had implantation.  She's offered to check RPL labs and karyotype although she thinks it will all be normal.  The best my lining has been was during IUI #1 and stims (little over 8mm).  I can't do a fresh transfer as my e2 was in the 7000s during my retrieval. 

My questions:
1) I want to stick to natural FETs as that is the only time I have ever had a positive test.  I am hesistant to do an ERA because I'm not sure the results would be easily extrapolated for subsequent natural FETs. Has anyone done a natural ERA that showed displaced window?  

2) My hypothesis is that I need to keep working on improving my lining.  I can't help but think that might have added been a factor in FET #2 being a chemical. I had an ultrasound done yesterday to rule out an ectopic and the doctor commented that my lining was thin ~6.7mm which I'm not surprised by since progesterone compacts the lining. Has anyone had more success with a tamoxifen over letrozole with thickening the lining? 

3) Would a hysteroscopy + biopsy for endometritis be worthwhile before trying another transfer? This would likely put me out for a few months before another transfer attempt due to summer travel.

4) My RE's clinic won't allow her to try HGH or do any of the more specialized RI treatments.  

5) I asked about Receptiva test to check for silent endo but my RE is worried that if I need 2 months of Lupron that it would further thin my lining.  She recommended a lap if I really want to go done this road, but I am hesistant as it is surgery.

6) My transfer was slightly uncomfortable as the doctor had a little trouble getting the catheter to the right spot (I think it's a bit of a sharper turn), so I am going to ask for valium next time.  Could that contribute to a chemical?

7) My doctor is open to trying steroids and lovenox for the next transfer.  Should I insist on this or wait for RPL labs before deciding? Is it risky to take these meds if you don't need them?

I had an ultrasound done yesterday to rule out an ectopic and the doctor commented that my lining was thin ~6.7mm which I&#39;m not surprised by since progesterone compacts the lining. Has anyone had more success with a tamoxifen over letrozole with thickening the lining? </p>

<p>3) Would a hysteroscopy + biopsy for endometritis be worthwhile before trying another transfer? This would likely put me out for a few months before another transfer attempt due to summer travel.</p>

<p>4) My RE&#39;s clinic won&#39;t allow her to try HGH or do any of the more specialized RI treatments.  </p>

<p>5) I asked about Receptiva test to check for silent endo but my RE is worried that if I need 2 months of Lupron that it would further thin my lining.  She recommended a lap if I really want to go done this road, but I am hesistant as it is surgery.</p>

<p>6) My transfer was slightly uncomfortable as the doctor had a little trouble getting the catheter to the right spot (I think it&#39;s a bit of a sharper turn), so I am going to ask for valium next time.  Could that contribute to a chemical?</p>

<p>7) My doctor is open to trying steroids and lovenox for the next transfer.  Should I insist on this or wait for RPL labs before deciding? Is it risky to take these meds if you don&#39;t need them?</p>

<p>Apologies for the lengthy post but any insight or thoughts are greatly appreciated.</p>

After going through my ob/gyn for several years we decided 6 months ago to go to the specialist. I live in a rural area and have to travel 2 hours for specialist appointments. Between traveling there several times a month, paying for services out of pocket (I have the worst insurance), and all of the medications, we are pretty invested in this thing. Last month we completed our third round of IUI and I was feeling like everything would work out this time. I even thought I felt different so I began to convince myself that it had happened.

149,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello everyone, finally decided I was good and ready to introduce myself to the forum. I have been lurking for a few months and the information gleaned here has been so incredible helpful in this bumpy journey.

I am a newly minted 40 year old and my partner is 42, together for 5 1/2 years recently engaged. We started trying about a 1 ½ ago, and after a few months of perfectly timed/OPKs/temping etc I decided to get some cursory testing done. When we first started dating he mentioned an adolescent varicocele and the doctor told him at 14 he would be infertile if it wasn’t fixed. Due to his estranged parents fighting-ino surgery. At the time it meant nothing to me (ha!) On my end, clockwork 27-28 day cycles. Ovulation pain around day 12, moderate cramps. 

So I went to a new OB for some answers and he performed some test on me; first a trans vaginal ultrasound informed me my ovaries look good (no AFC told to me), tilted uterus (was aware)  and I had 2 fibroids that “shouldn’t impact fertility” (complete surprise) but he was more alarmed by a mass in my right breast that had previously been dismissed by every other OB I had seen (I was told I had cystic breast). Any talk of trying got shelved as I underwent testing since it appeared suspicious and then biopsied which came back as complicated benign mess of just about everything breast lump related. We then had a death in the family and last Nov I was able to get back in and get a cursory hormonal panel done. My AMH came back as 2.88 ng/ml, FSH was 5.6 miu/ml, LH was 4.8 miu/ml but my Estradiol was below 20.  I followed up with him regarding the E2 but he said that’s what it should look like but it concerned me. great numbers for just shy of 40 he said.  

I finally got my fiance to get his sperm tested and it came back dismal. His actual sperm count was ok…they all just appear to be DOA.  Sperm count was around 148 mill, but his morph was 2% and total motility was 4%. At this point is where I became panicked and start googling everything under the sun. I had no misgivings at attempting to start at family at 39, but I was the natural success of a 40 year old, who was the success of a 44 year old. Oh how woefully misinformed I was. I put my partner on a crap ton of vitamins and supplements and in the meantime started gathering my ducks together to dive straight into IVF to which I am incredible fortunate that I have covered via my insurance. On my end I started religiously taking my prenatal and COQ10.

2nd sperm analysis after being on supplements/vitamins 3 months or so (I figured the 3 month mark is a good snapshot of sperm production if the supplements work and if the first one was a fluke) Well the first SA wasn’t a fluke, but his numbers did improve slightly. Total sperm count was 316 mill, Morph was 3% and total motility was 38%  His is waiting to see a urologist as his primary care physician initially dismissed my push for a urologist (he didn’t even see the point of my fiancé doing a SA in the first place! Poo-pooed him and told him to just keep trying and stop eating meat. wtf)

We just had our initial consultation at one of the few centers approved by my insurance (center of excellence bs) and I came away with mixed feelings and a bit of anger. Angry because during the consultative trans-vaginal ultrasound the RE pointed out that I have a submucosal fibroid that would need to come out and was most likely impacting fertility AND the 2nd aforementioned fibroid is on the OUTSIDE of my uterus, potentially interfering with my right ovary. He gave me a rough draft AFC (I was actually about to start my period in 4 days) on CD 23- counted 5 on my left and 3 or 4 on my right, but he couldn’t tell because it was hard to see due to flipping fibroid.  Because this is through my insurance it also felt very informal and casual which kind of gave me room for pause. Pricing wasn’t discussed, it was just well you’re in. sign here. RE outlined a brief 6 mo. timeline that involved recoup time due to a hysteroscopic myomectomyto (which he believes is whats causing the tipped uterus since its right in the angle/fold) but no mention of the outside one. I also found out there that my insurance doesn’t allow embryos banking. So I would have to go thru egg retrieval then a FET. If it fails, start from go. Considering my age that is a concern. We left the office without signing anything official to talk it over.

Well we agreed to move forward, sooner rather than later (even with wedding/s etc coming up) had to call in to the clinic to get script sent so I could go get new blood work. I got my new results today and here is where my questions begin and I begin side-eying this clinic.  

My AMH came back as .952! 

I didn’t know it could plummet so quickly? It’s like I turned 40 and my ovaries were like ok we good?  I got the 1st test less than 6 months prior. My TSH came back elevated at 2.88 and from lurking here I am reading that is too high. My vitamin D was also low (20) everything else was fine.   Unfortunately, and this is where I am side eyeing this new clinic, the nurse I spoke with didn’t put in orders for FSH, LH. Estradiol etc. So I only have my new stand alone AMH test to stare at, and nothing to compare it to. I specifically busted ass to get to the lab on my CD3 for this blood test as well. So that irks a bit. 

So now here I am. Trying to figure out my next step. Do I call my clinic and ask why the secondary portion of the labs weren’t taken and retake the test next cycle? Which pushes the start date one month later? Or is the FSH etc just not nesc to start IVF? I am so confused. Sorry for this book. I haven't talked to anyone about this. 

TLDR: Just turned 40, turning to IVF for what I previously thought was just MFI, now appears to be DOR and uterine issues. Is it possible for AMH to drop rapidly under 6 months? Is one lab an outlier?  Confused on how to sort out issues to take ivf step.",[],False,,0,False,"Turned 40, AMH fell off a cliff in under 5 months.

We’re done with IVF for now so I restarted hormone replacement therapy a few months ago. I have read a lot about DOR sometimes being linked with a testosterone deficiency, so I asked my gyn to test my levels because my libido has been crap. I had to ask 3 different doctors and I finally found one who would test it. My level came back as ZERO. For a normal pre-menopause woman it should be 20-45ish and something like 350+ for a man. The doctor I found specializes in menopause treatment and told me that a lot of gyns aren’t up to date on management because 90% of their practice is OB. She started me on testosterone cream along with estrogen patches & vaginal progesterone. The testosterone really has made a big difference in terms of how often I think about sex and how physically enjoyable it is. It hasn’t fixed things completely, but I think that’s mostly due to the trauma of IVF. Testosterone therapy is recommended by the American Menopause Society if there are significant issues with libido.

I had also read that DOR patients should get a DEXA bone scan for osteoporosis when they are diagnosed and had to ask for that since none of my doctors suggested it. My test results came back as osteopenia or pre-osteoporosis at age 35. Osteoporosis is linked to low estrogen and this is one of the reasons estrogen replacement is important in the long term. 

My point is, make sure you educate yourself and advocate for yourself! There’s a good chance no one else will.

During these 7 years my husband and I have done an enormous amount of tests and procedures including: 3 hysteroscopies, hysterosalpingography, laproscopy surgery for ovarian torsion, Halosperm test, Karyotype test, 5 IUI cycles, IMSI sperm selection, PGS, 4 Egg retrievals, 2 fresh cycle transfers, 7 FETs.  A total of 15 embryos were transferred and all of them were of good or excellent quality. Most of them, blastocysts. 

&#x200B;

All these efforts have so far ended with 2 chemical pregnancies and 1 ectopic pregnancy. 

&#x200B;

All tests we have done came back normal. However, I'm almost certain that something is wrong with my uterus. 

5 years ago, I've been through my 1st hysteroscopic surgery due to light adhesions and a polyp (the reason for the adhesions remains unknown). An examination a month later showed the procedure was successful, and my uterus was back to normal. 

5 months later, I had to go through hysteroscopic surgery again, this time due to polypoid appearance of the uterine lining, and lack of any lining shedding even after progesterone treatment. The lining reached 17mm at the time. 

The diagnosis of the lining biopsy was ""simple hyperplasia without atypia"". After the surgery, I was treated with oral progesterone for 2 months. My menstrual bleeding has been lighter than usual, but relatively normal after that. However, 4 months later, I went through ovarian torsion. My ovary was saved, but my menstrual flow has been abnormal ever since (more than 3 years ago).

Now, the flow is mere dark or light brown minimal spotting that usually lasts 5-7 days. My uterine lining reaches good thickness of 8-11 mm. And after the spotting it's 3-4 mm. I've done a few diagnostic hysteroscopy examinations and everything appeared normal. My doctor also preformed pipelle and the result that came back was ""polipoid lining"", but nothing more than that. 

On ultrasound, the lining never appears to be triliminar, and most times it contains small cyst like structures. 

I should also mention, that after the chemical pregnancies and during the ectopic, the bleeding was very heavy. But, those were the only times it happened in the last 3 years. At all other times, the bleeding is barely noticeable. 

&#x200B;

I've had my last unsuccessful FET this month, which is 5 months after the ectopic pregnancy in which I lost my tube.

I'm 41 w/ day-three AFC of 12, AMH of 1.5, and FSH of 7.7.  No coffee, no alcohol, never smoked.  I eat very well, thyroid levels normal range.  Used to exercise regularly, but that has gotten harder to keep up over the IVF cycles.  I take CoQ10, omegas, zinc, D, E, folic acid, DHEA, etc.  

Husband is 51 w/ normal SA, and excellent results on a SCSA fragmentation test.  

And yet...  Multiple failed Day-2 freeze-all ICSI retrieval cycles.  (Just for completeness, adding that we chose EmbryoGen and time-lapse photography for all cycles.)  Not one fertilized embryo to show for the effort and money spent.  0% fertilization rate.  Literal goose eggs each time.  

This cycle, they tried a different stim protocol and had a pretty good response.  9 follicles on the left, 3 on the right, all in a fairly tight range.  E2 still soaring day of trigger, P4 less than 1, and E2:P4 greater than 1. 

I should feel happy (or at least hopeful), right?  But I don't.  Retrieval was yesterday, and fertilization results are today.  (Today!  Of all days!!  Sigh...)

However bloods were done and with the hospital being aware of ivf they tested for HCG. It was negative

I spent the weekend in hospital and came home on Monday and had my official beta on Tuesday which confirmed the negative result. I was so upset but work was busy and I barely noticed my feelings let alone Mother’s Day lead up all around me.

200,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Trigger - mention of living child

Hi all, I'm 38 and my husband is 37 and I'm waiting around for my period to start before beginning my first IVF cycle. The anxiety that I'm going to face going through fertility treatment and (hopefully) pregnancy is going go be intense, so the waiting around is a rough time. 

My appendix ruptured during the third trimester of a previous pregnancy. They removed the appendix, but ten days post-op I wound up in septic shock due to chorioamnionitis. I was in severe respiratory distress and had a fever of 105. I ended up having an ""acute change in mental status"" (aka psychotic break) - I thought I was dying, and tried to tear out my IVs and jump off the OR table, so they had to put me under immediately. I spent a week in the ICU after the delivery trying to fight off this out-of-control infection and re-learn to breathe. \[Trigger: our LC survived\].

Since then we've been trying to conceive for almost a year. I had an ectopic pregnancy last summer which didn't respond to medication, so I lost my left tube. It turns out my fallopian tubes got quite damaged due to the ruptured appendix + post-op complications, so a natural pregnancy would be next to impossible. Before starting IVF however, I had to get my remaining tube ligated, as it posed a risk for another ectopic pregnancy. 

The tubal ligation surgery ended up being more traumatic than my ectopic, oddly enough. I ended up having a PTSD attack on entering the operating room (why they didn't sedate me beforehand I can't comprehend!) and my anxiety didn't exactly dissipate during the surgery, so I woke up severely agitated, screaming obscenities (apparently - I have no memory of this) and had to be re-sedated. They seemed pretty pissed at me too, scolding me afterwards that I was ""disrupting"" the other patients. My body was in such a panicked state that for days I couldn't even pee without a catheter. It took a full three months for my heart to stop racing periodically, day and night. 

So I'm in a strange state of feeling like the past is behind me, but also like PTSD could decide to jump out at any point, especially given the crazy hormones I'll be taking for IVF. I also feel like my body ultimately has more control over me than my mind does. It decides whether I panic or stay calm. Hell, it even decides whether or not I can empty my own dang bladder! So if it can do that, maybe my late period (100% not due to pregnancy) is just my body's way of saying ""hell no, we're not getting on this train, you already almost killed me once - not again!"" 

I know these thoughts are silly, but it's where my mind is going. I'm not even two days late. I just want to get my period so I can start IVF, assuming I won't have ""time to think"" once the gears are in motion ... but I realize that's wishful thinking! Anyone have go to distraction methods when all you can do is think and agonize over every detail of what your body is / is not doing??

&#x200B;

I'm 30F, husband is 31M. Apart from three close friends and my sister, we have told no one about our struggles trying to conceive. Our friends and families still receive the ""we are undecided about children"" response. I will one day tell them all about this process, but for now, I just can't handle it. We are both introverted and private, so we prefer to not involve others at this time. It's hard enough dealing with my own emotions, I don't want to involve those of family and friends, nor unsolicited advice. This fact makes communities like this that much more important for me to not feel alone.

&#x200B;

 We began trying to conceive in February 2018. Experienced a miscarriage in January 2019 at around 7 weeks. Over the course of this time, noteworthy various lab tests and diagnostic testing have come back as:

* Borderline high FSH (10.8 with 10.8 being the upper boundary of normal)
* Borderline low AMH (0.75 with 0.7 being the lower boundary of normal)
* Normal/Low AFC (14 follicles in baseline)
* Potential misshaped uterus: ultrasound suggested bicornuate, MRI concluded arcuate, HSG showed normal

&#x200B;

Beginning our first IVF cycle now. I am currently priming (is that the right term?) for a freeze all cycle. We will be doing PGS. I placed my first estradiol patch this morning and have my first injection of cetrotide tomorrow. I know logically that we will make it through this process, regardless of the outcome. However, it is still very overwhelming. While I wish none of us had to experience this, I am grateful for this community and look forward to participating here.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the warm welcome. It is comforting to know that I'm not alone in this. I'm in a weird limbo w.r.t to DOR. My numbers point to DOR, but my Dr. says not quite. My understanding is that using AMH to qualify ovarian reserve and measuring AMH in and of itself is still somewhat new and sometimes considered unofficial (can't recall the right vocab term). Maybe I'm just trying to cling on to hope. Maybe I'm trying to trust my Dr. (I know self advocation is important too though). I don't know.

So lets start off by explaining that in February 2018 myself and another coworker (S) found out that we were pregnant at the exact same time. A couple months later, another already pregnant coworker (K) went on maternity leave. In April of 2018, after being in limbo for a few weeks, I was told that I would need to take medication to miscarry and I lost my baby as they stopped growing. When I got pregnant with this baby I had completed my 7th consecutive IUI so I was really ecstatic about it finally working after having tried non-medically for 4 years plus those additional 7 months. Then I was told that if I wanted to really have children of my own I would need to go through IVF as I was diagnosed with female infertility to begin with. Not sure why we could not try IUI again. So not only was I dealing with the stress, anxiety and depression of being told I was infertile, I lost a baby I so desperately had been trying for years to have. To then have the financial and emotional stress of having to go through IVF. 

My work environment is very supportive when it came to me trying to get pregnant; I shared the whole process with them until I miscarried. All of a sudden I lost my baby and every one of my coworkers acted like I did not exist. No one asked me how I was doing or checked in on me. Not only that, but S would talk about “baby this” and “baby that” all day, everyday while I sat in my open cubicle having to endure listening to someone talk about the baby they would eventually get to have as I grieved horribly for the loss of my own and the lack of acknowledgement from all of them. Given that no one acknowledged my loss or supported me as they once had, I decided that going through IVF I was not going to be sharing as I once did. 

I kept my egg retrieval to myself. All the medications and injections I had to administer sometimes 3 times daily, didn’t share at all. Having to shell out $18k in the matter of one month to pay for all of this was really stressful as well. And then still grieving and fearing that I was going to be replacing the baby I lost with a new one was hard to not think about.  

But what has me really puzzled is how S and K have gone to HR and let them know that they do not feel comfortable in the office because of me. Because I have made it aware that they should receive training to support women who have miscarriages given that we work with pregnant women and their children and if they cant support me, how can they support a client who it may happen to? I don’t care if they cannot support me as I have grown and do not need them now, but we get trainings all the time and I felt this was important. They do not feel comfortable because I do not share what is happening in my life with them anymore. And yes, sometimes I feel angry about whats happened to me (I don’t take it out on them, I just keep to myself and look angry). They have claimed that I am mad at them because they got to have their babies and not me. 

I still to this day hear them constantly asking each other how their things are going and checking in on each other, but no one has come up to me to ask me how its going or anything. So while they claim I am mad at them, I have gone through some major life adjustments and psychologically damaging experiences that will naturally cause me to have emotions.

<p>I still to this day hear them constantly asking each other how their things are going and checking in on each other, but no one has come up to me to ask me how its going or anything. So while they claim I am mad at them, I have gone through some major life adjustments and psychologically damaging experiences that will naturally cause me to have emotions. </p>

<p>I don’t know what to do or what to think, anyone have any theories as to what their problem is?</p>

We had all of our embryos fail to progress after day 3.

In line with this post is another that I'm working on about Happiness. Not in the sparkles and rainbows way that so many people who have found success feel we *should* have as we run the infernal gauntlet of infertility, but happiness in the sense that we understand where we are and how we can make incremental changes on the need to achieve success for us to be happy (as well as understanding that success isn't binary). But I digress...

&#x200B;

We all have friends, family, ahem, even people here, that tell us that positivity is the way through infertility. But the thing is that negatively identified emotions are going to occur on some level. It's how we acknowledge them and engage with our emotions that is the key to our emotional well-being. Note that I didn't say our emotional happiness/positivity/hope. No. I said *well-being*.

&#x200B;

Quoting the article and video, as it's spot on:

**Suppressing or turning away from our difficult emotions is not healthy or helpful, says David.** “What happens is, it undermines our ability to deal with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be,” she says. “This is associated with lower levels of resilience, lower levels of wellbeing, and higher levels of depression and anxiety. And it also impacts our relationships and our ability to achieve our goals.”

**So, what should we do instead?**

**“Instead of pushing it aside or forcing positivity, one critical way of dealing with a difficult emotion is to label it effectively.** In my work, so often people will use very black-and-white labels to describe how they’re feeling,” says David. “‘Stressed’ is one of the most common ones. But there’s a world of difference between the stress of true overwhelm, stress because you’re disappointed, or the stress of knowing you’re in the wrong job or the wrong relationship. When we can label our emotions more accurately, it helps us understand the cause of those emotions and activates what’s called a ‘readiness potential,’ your ability to set goals and to make real concrete changes.”

**Next, when you identify your emotion, “notice the emotion with compassion.** People frequently think that compassion is about being weak or lazy or lying to yourself,” says David. “Actually compassion allows you to create a safe space within yourself in which you are then able to take more risks. You’re able to explore the world, and you’re able to be more effective, because you know that if things don’t go right that you will still like yourself, you’ll still be kind to yourself. Compassion is associated with greater levels of effectiveness.”

**Finally, “try to notice the emotional story for what it is,” says David.** Create some space between you and what you’re feeling by acting as an observer and naming all the dimensions of your experience. Instead of simply saying “I’m sad,” she suggests, “say something like, ‘I’m noticing that I’m feeling sad, I’m noticing that I’m feeling undermined, I’m noticing the urge to leave the room.’ This allows you to bring other parts of yourself — such as your values and your intentions — forward.” Doing this also puts *you* in charge rather than the emotion. “What’s more important is not whether you have negative thoughts or emotions but whether you get hooked into them,” she says, “which is when those thoughts start to drive your behaviors and your interactions.”

222,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi Everyone,

&#x200B;

This might be lengthy, but I appreciate any help we can get. My wife (30F) and I (30M) are trying to conceive, and have been since September of last year.

&#x200B;

Our doctors and us suspect she has endometriosis, due in part to cysts found during a midcycle ultrasound. We're having another in the next few weeks to confirm this. This will be relevant later.

&#x200B;

After consulting a fertility specialist, we decided our first course of action would be a round of Letrozole (Femara), followed by a Pregnyl trigger shot to induce ovulation. This was in late January. She started taking the Letrozole, and several days (before the trigger shot) began experiencing intense pelvic pain. It was bad. She's generally very good with pain, but there were days where she almost couldn't function. This continued throughout her next cycle. When she did get her next period, it was almost unbearable for her, and really difficult to watch. I felt helpless and it was terrible for the both of us.

&#x200B;

The following cycle was still bad, but the pain was less frequent and intense. She just began menstruating yesterday, and now is pretty much back to baseline; there's still a rare flareup of pain, but these manageable and don't last long. Basically, it seems like the further away she got from taking Letrozole, the pain that seemed to be triggered by the drug became less and less.

&#x200B;

Here's where we're in a difficult spot. We've consulted two fertility specialists, both of whom are equally confused about her extreme reaction to the Letrozole. They can't explain it. We've done research (we realize using the internet for stuff like this can be just starting a brand new fire, but anyway) and the only possible theory we've come up with is that somehow the increased production of FSH and LH temporarily exacerbated her probable endometriosis.

&#x200B;

My questions are then, has anybody had a similar experience?

Can anyone explain why she had this reaction? 

We want to try another cycle of medication before IVF or any type of procedure for endometriosis. I know Clomid works differently, but achieves the same result of stimulating FSH and LH production. Is it likely she'll have the same reaction to Clomid then as well?

&#x200B;

TL;DR, wife had an awful reaction to Letrozole including months of intense pain. Why would this happen, and would it be safe for her to take Clomid?

Thank you all very much!",[],False,,0,False,Question about pain after taking Letrozole (Femara),[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_bmypas,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,False,2,,self,False,,{},,True,,1557525927.0,text,0,,,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi Everyone,</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>This might be lengthy, but I appreciate any help we can get. My wife (30F) and I (30M) are trying to conceive, and have been since September of last year.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Our doctors and us suspect she has endometriosis, due in part to cysts found during a midcycle ultrasound. We&#39;re having another in the next few weeks to confirm this. This will be relevant later.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>After consulting a fertility specialist, we decided our first course of action would be a round of Letrozole (Femara), followed by a Pregnyl trigger shot to induce ovulation. This was in late January. She started taking the Letrozole, and several days (before the trigger shot) began experiencing intense pelvic pain. It was bad. She&#39;s generally very good with pain, but there were days where she almost couldn&#39;t function. This continued throughout her next cycle. When she did get her next period, it was almost unbearable for her, and really difficult to watch. I felt helpless and it was terrible for the both of us.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The following cycle was still bad, but the pain was less frequent and intense. She just began menstruating yesterday, and now is pretty much back to baseline; there&#39;s still a rare flareup of pain, but these manageable and don&#39;t last long. Basically, it seems like the further away she got from taking Letrozole, the pain that seemed to be triggered by the drug became less and less.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where we&#39;re in a difficult spot. We&#39;ve consulted two fertility specialists, both of whom are equally confused about her extreme reaction to the Letrozole. They can&#39;t explain it. We&#39;ve done research (we realize using the internet for stuff like this can be just starting a brand new fire, but anyway) and the only possible theory we&#39;ve come up with is that somehow the increased production of FSH and LH temporarily exacerbated her probable endometriosis.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>My questions are then, has anybody had a similar experience?</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why she had this reaction? </p>

<p>We want to try another cycle of medication before IVF or any type of procedure for endometriosis. I know Clomid works differently, but achieves the same result of stimulating FSH and LH production. Is it likely she&#39;ll have the same reaction to Clomid then as well?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>TL;DR, wife had an awful reaction to Letrozole including months of intense pain. Why would this happen, and would it be safe for her to take Clomid?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Thank you all very much!</p>

The process was reasonably easy, given the level of shit we go through in this whole process.  It does help to speak some Spanish.  

I started by getting my signed Rx from my clinic on paper/pdf.  Last Friday 5/3 I called Fertifarma's Mexico City location to make my order.  I had to get through the robo-response menu in Spanish (hit 2 for service to Customers).  I explained I live in the U.S. and wanted to make an order to be shipped to UPS near the border (but still in Mexico).  I asked if anyone spoke English, and at first the response seemed to be no.  They asked if I had ever made an order with them, and when I said No, they transferred me to New Customer Intake where actually, the person spoke English (named Santiago, very nice guy).

It was very easy to explain to Santiago my order.  He only asked what Dr. and name of my clinic was prescribing, but never asked me to send a copy of the Rx.  After a couple minutes on hold, he told me that Pregnyl and Ganirelix are no longer available (possibly throughout Mexico), but that they recommend Choragon (which seems to be the same as Pregnyl) and Cetrotide as replacements.  He told me to ask my Dr. if it is ok to switch to these meds.  I called my clinic and they confirmed on Monday 5/6, that this was ok.  

I called again on Monday 5/6 and asked for Santiago.  He called me back that day and I confirmed the change in meds was ok.  He put together my order, told me the final price (which matched exactly the prices listed on the Fertifarma website).  Shipping was free, he said because the order was more than 5000 pesos.  I gave him my credit card number.  He put the order through and said it would ship the next day, Tuesday 5/7.

On Tuesday 5/7, I got an e-mail with my order receipt and a second e-mail with the UPS tracking number.  The package arrived Wednesday afternoon 5/8.  UPS called me that afternoon and (in English) asked if the package needed to be refrigerated.  I said, Yes, if possible, and they said they could refrigerate it.

This morning Thursday 5/9, my husband and I drove to the border and parked in a nearby shopping center on the U.S. side.  We walked about half a mile to the Pedestrian crossing area and went right through without a wait.  The walk there was well marked with signs.  The Mexican immigration lady just glanced at our passports without stamping or scanning.  She asked how long we would be in Mexico, and I said just that day.

Once we had made it out to the public street, we got an Uber to the UPS, which was just as easy to do as in the U.S.  It cost $3.  At the UPS, they spoke English and he asked my name and to see my ID to pick up the package.  The package was just a styrofoam cooler package taped up with packing tape and shipping labels, but seemed to have been treated with care. Then we got an Uber right back to the border crossing for Pedestrians (Peatonal).

Again, the walk up to the immigration area was well marked with signs showing where pedestrians go.  The line was about 15 people long in front of us (but shortly after we arrived we saw the line get longer behind us).  It took about 10-15 minutes to get to the front.

This was the most stressful part of the process.  The immigration officer asked what we were bringing in.  I said medication.  He asked for what.  I said it's fertility medication, for IVF.  He asked what amounts?  I was like, Do you want to see my prescription?  He asked if it was covered by my insurance.  I said No.  He asked where we live, which confused me because why does that matter?  I'm American.  I told him where (right across the border in the U.S.).  He asked how often we're bringing these medications through, and I said it was the first time.  He said, It was prescribed by a Mexican Dr.?  And I got confused again and really felt like he was trying to trick me, so I said I didn't understand and then just shoved my Prescriptions in his face.  He looked at them and then said it was Ok because they were prescribed by an American Dr.  He said if they were prescribed by a Mexican Dr. I would not be allowed to take it through.  This scared me because it doesn't seem right!  The meds are legal on both sides of the border!  I didn't say anything and just took my meds and continued on my way.  We put the box through the X-ray scanner (hope that was ok) and walked through back to the U.S.

When we got home, I unpacked the styrofoam box, which was very professionally packed and still quite cold.  Inside, the styrofoam was lined with a metallic bubble wrap insulation that was perfectly folded and taped up nicely.  I opened that layer of insulation and there were cold packs on top of and below the medication.  The medication itself was organized into a perfect cube inside of a clear plastic bag that was also taped up.  All looks well!

I got the following for $1516 (28,778 pesos):

- 3 Gonal F 300 pens

- 7 Menopur 75IU vials (called Merapur)

- 8 Cetrotide .25mg

- 2 Choragon 5000IU (alternative to Pregnyl 5000IU)

- 6 Saizen 6mg (18IU)

Hope this is helpful for some others and demystifies this process a little.

Edit:  In case not obvious, the reason to walk across the border is that the line to get back in a car can be many hours long.  My total time from home and back was 3 hours doing the walk, and that included 45 mins to get a coffee in Mexico because I didn’t have the UPS opening time right.",[],False,,0,False,My Fertifarma Experience - Getting Meds in Mexico,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_bmogel,False,dark,1.0,,public,34,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,False,34,,self,1557444313.0,,{},,True,,1557460809.0,text,0,,,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Others here have written a little about their experiences getting their IVF meds at Fertifarma in Mexico, but I thought I&#39;d share my experience.

238,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I suppose it all started July 2017. I went to the ER in excruciating pain thinking I had appendicitis. Turned out I had a ruptured cyst on my right ovary.  

I went to a follow up appointment a few weeks later in August as recommended, but really didn't like the OBGYN I went to see. I didn't know much about cysts and, as far as I knew, never had one before. He brushed of my questions and concerns without really ever answering them and made it all seem like no big deal. I am not particularly fond of going to drs for that very reason. So I never went for my follow up ultrasound. It was no big deal right?

I went to my annual physical with my PCP and brought her up to speed on what happened over the summer. She said she was more than happy to send me for a follow up ultrasound and we could go from there. I went to that one in January 2018. The results showed two cysts, one on my left ovary and one on my right. My PCP recommended we watch them and go for another ultrasound in 3 months.

April 2018 I went for the ultrasound. Although the ultrasound techs are not suppose to talk to you about what they see, she recommended I see a specialist since the cysts don't look like normal cysts.  I got a call from my Dr with the results a day or two later. She said that the cysts are still there and have not increased or decreased in size. She said she would be discussing the results with a colleague. A couple days later she referred me to an OBGYN.

In May I went to the appointment with the OBGYN. She explained to me the results of the ultrasound saying the results show endometriosis. She recommended I have surgery to remove the endometriosis because of the combo of the ultrasound results and the fact that intercourse was excruciatingly painful. 

My laparoscopy was scheduled for June 2018. I was both scared and excited. Scared to have surgery, but excited that intercourse would be pleasurable again and not a chore.

When I woke up, my OBGYN came over to me. She said she already spoke with my boyfriend, and she would go into more detail tomorrow, but they didn't take anything out. When she went in, she found it was not endometriosis, but what looked to her link cancer. She had an OBGYN oncologist on call for the two surgeries prior to mine, and called her in. She said that it's NOT cancer. It's called Borderline Tumors. Then she apologized. 

I was pretty groggy from anesthesia but my boyfriend explained it again to me. The surgery basically became in exploratory surgery. They took out a sample of the tumor to biopsy. 

The next day my Dr called me to see how I was doing and to explain again what was found. She said she is referring me over to the oncologist that saw me in the OR and asked if I wanted to come in to get the pics of the laparoscopy and she can explain to me what I'm looking at. I said yes.

I went two days later to her office where she showed me that the borderline tumors spread from my left ovary to my right ovary. My entire lower abdominal cavity was filled with stuff that looked like cauliflower. She showed me bits of whites spots on the surface of my liver and diaphragm and explained that is all the borderline tumors as well. Again... not cancer.

A few days later I went and saw the OBGYN oncologist. She said borderline tumors are somewhat rare but they are not cancer. They sort of act like cancer in that it looks like it and spreads. It does not spread nearly as fast as cancer does and does not invade lymph nodes like cancer.  She said it does not require chemo to treat. It is a surgery disease meaning you hace surgery to remove it and you sgould be ok. To be honest.... I still don't really know what it is. There's not much information on it.

I had to have another surgery. Except this surgery, I had no idea what I would be waking up to. The tumors were so bad, she wasn't sure if she would be able to save the ovaries until she got in there. She also needed to send me for an MRI to see if the tumors spread to my lungs. This would also determine how far she needed to cut me open. If it was on my lungs, she would need to cut me from chest to 6 inches below my belly button. If not, then just from my belly button. She said this would be a massive surgery and I would need to take 6 weeks off from work. 6 weeks? I've barely taken 6 days...

My surgery was scheduled in July 2018, 2 days after my birthday. I'd be 31. The day of my surgery came. God, I was so scared. I had no idea if I'd wake up with 1, 2 or 0 ovaries. When was terrified waiting to go in. Scared for how big of the surgery, scared what would happen, scared that is wake up and everything I've worked so hard for for my future, just gone, in the blink of an eye. 

I closed my eyes and when I opened them again, I was in the recovery room.  They wouldn't let my boyfriend come back. I just kept asking. Finally they had some escort him back but said he could only stay for a minute.

I knew they told him. He asked if I wanted to know. I said no, I just didn't want to be alone. Even if just for a minute.  I was finally put in my room where I would be for the next 4 days. I asked people not to visit me. I didn't know what mental state I would be in and didn't want to feel like I had to entertain anyone that came.  I asked my boyfriend before he left for the night what happened. He said surgery went well. The Dr said she got all of the tumors out. It hadn't spread anywhere further that what was seen in the laparoscopy. The left ovary had to be removed. It was too far overcome with the tumors. The right ovary she was able to salvage part of. She cleaned up the part that was still good tissue, and stitched it together.

I still had a chance. Possibility. Hope. Even if I only had half of one ovary to work with. The next few days were a bit of a blur because of the meds.

I was healing up great in the hospital and for the first week home. It wasn't until I had to have my staples removed where everything when down hill again. My incision wasn't healing properly. They had to rip it back open. They put me on a sponge vac until the wound healed. The sponge vac worked to remove necrotic tissue and allow the healthy tissue to grow.  Eventually my incision healed, but I was left with a worse scar than I would have had if my body just did what it was supposed to. 

Since I was able to keep part of my ovary, I wasn't cleared out of the woods yet. I still had an ovary..there was a chance that the tumors could come back. I'd need to be monitored.

In October, I went for a follow up ultrasound. My results showed two small cysts on my ovary. One of them normal. The other too small to tell but was concerning. My OBGYN oncologist referred me to a fertility Dr to get my eggs removed and frozen to preserve my fertility. Just in case that cyst is the tumors coming back.  She pulled out my IUD since my boyfriend and I decided we wouldn't push our luck and start trying to have a baby.

A few weeks later we saw the fertility Dr, but now we were just waiting on me getting my period.  

I had a follow up ultrasound December. It just so happens I got my period as well so fertility was able to get what they wanted to see from the ultrasound all well.  Fertility said everything looked good. Oncology said my cysts reduced in size. This was good news. If it were the tumors coming back, they wouldn't have reduced. My OBGYN oncologist said she'd see me in 6 months for the follow up ultrasound and results. That appointment is scheduled for June. 

In the meantime, I've been working with fertility. By the time January rolled around, I had two normal cycles. With the cycle I had in January,  fertilityhad me doing IVF to get my eggs out and preserved. I did 2 weeks of Gonal F at the highest dose. Nothing. Was. Happening. My ovary wasn't producing mature follicles. We had to cancel it. My body actually did worse with intervention than when I was producing on my own.

January 15th was my last normal period. We were waiting for my cycle to start again to see if I was ovulating, but nothing was happening. Estrogen was too low, progesterone, too low. They put me on provera for 10 days to force my period, and it worked.  

I've baffled my Dr.  We already knew I had a low reserve of eggs. She ruled out menopause, POCS... there is nothing else that could be causing me issues. It just very simply that there was just too much trauma to the ovary for it to function properly.

There was nothing else she could do for me. I asked the question I didn't want the answer to. ""In your opinion, is it possible I could get pregnant on my own?"" 

""It is very unlikely.""

My incision wasn&#39;t healing properly. They had to rip it back open. They put me on a sponge vac until the wound healed. The sponge vac worked to remove necrotic tissue and allow the healthy tissue to grow.  Eventually my incision healed, but I was left with a worse scar than I would have had if my body just did what it was supposed to. </p>

<p>Since I was able to keep part of my ovary, I wasn&#39;t cleared out of the woods yet. I still had an ovary..there was a chance that the tumors could come back. I&#39;d need to be monitored.</p>

<p>In October, I went for a follow up ultrasound. My results showed two small cysts on my ovary. One of them normal. The other too small to tell but was concerning. My OBGYN oncologist referred me to a fertility Dr to get my eggs removed and frozen to preserve my fertility. Just in case that cyst is the tumors coming back.  She pulled out my IUD since my boyfriend and I decided we wouldn&#39;t push our luck and start trying to have a baby.</p>

<p>A few weeks later we saw the fertility Dr, but now we were just waiting on me getting my period.  </p>

<p>I had a follow up ultrasound December. It just so happens I got my period as well so fertility was able to get what they wanted to see from the ultrasound all well.  Fertility said everything looked good. Oncology said my cysts reduced in size. This was good news. If it were the tumors coming back, they wouldn&#39;t have reduced. My OBGYN oncologist said she&#39;d see me in 6 months for the follow up ultrasound and results. That appointment is scheduled for June. </p>

<p>In the meantime, I&#39;ve been working with fertility. By the time January rolled around, I had two normal cycles. With the cycle I had in January,  fertilityhad me doing IVF to get my eggs out and preserved. I did 2 weeks of Gonal F at the highest dose. Nothing. Was. Happening. My ovary wasn&#39;t producing mature follicles. We had to cancel it. My body actually did worse with intervention than when I was producing on my own.</p>

<p>January 15th was my last normal period. We were waiting for my cycle to start again to see if I was ovulating, but nothing was happening. Estrogen was too low, progesterone, too low. They put me on provera for 10 days to force my period, and it worked.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve baffled my Dr.  We already knew I had a low reserve of eggs. She ruled out menopause, POCS... there is nothing else that could be causing me issues. It just very simply that there was just too much trauma to the ovary for it to function properly.</p>

<p>There was nothing else she could do for me. I asked the question I didn&#39;t want the answer to. &quot;In your opinion, is it possible I could get pregnant on my own?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It is very unlikely.&quot;</p>

<p>Now I wait to go in June to find out if my tumors are coming back, and if I have to remove the last bit of hope from my body.</p>

My story is: at 28 years old, my husband and I were TTC for over 1 year (naively just using an app) and in 2017 when I had an HSG done that diagnosed me with a right hydrosalplinx. Shortly after that I had surgery to have my right blocked fallopian tube removed.

We tried for another year on our own before deciding to do a round of clomid assisted IUI (found out he had lower count and low motility during this process). I went in for ultrasound to time the ovulation/trigger shot, and they found fibroids in my uterus. They told me I could still go forward with the IUI but it may decrease the chances. We decided to go through with it, and then have a the fibroids removed after if it did not take. After the failed IUI, I had the fibroids removed (August 2018).

We got pregnant on our own in September 2018. I called my Dr. and they gave me the usual schpeal and did not have me coming in until the 8 week mark (which I disagreed with, given my fertility issues/previous surgeries thus far, but regrettably didn't speak up). At 7 and a half weeks I was visiting family about 12 hours from home, when I ended up in the hospital for 4 days with a ruptured cornual ectopic on the right side that required emergency surgery and blood transfusion.

An ectopic pregnancy was never on my radar. No one ever mentioned it being a risk. I blame myself. But I also blame my old ob/gyn. I was so naive that while I was unknowingly bleeding out, and getting an ultrasound done to see what was happening, I asked if I could have the ultrasound printed because it was my first....

Now 31yrs old, I had multiple opinions and visits with different doctors post-op to decide what our next step was. I'll save you the tedious details on that but ultimately we decided to wait a year until we try again, to let my uterus heal as long as possible (this coming Oct. 2019). We also found new polyps in my uterine lining back in Dec. at one of my post op checks (my uterus just likes to grow everything other than a baby huh!?). We plan to schedule to have those removed closer to when we are ready to TTC again.

I was just seeing if anyone else has had anything similar happen. The ectopic was on the right side, which is where I DID NOT have a tube. They called it a cornual ectopic because technically it was in the uterus, but in the uppermost corner where the tube would have connected, and where I must have a lot of scar tissue, and now definitely have way more scar tissue.

Boy am I glad I found a support group on reddit for this.

I am a 22F who had a laprascopic surgery last week for suspected endometriosis. They found it, they found a lot of it. With this they also did a dye test and found one tube is totally blocked and the other one seems to be about 90%.

Ive had a hard week. The first couple of days were okay and now I'm just.. Devastated. I didn't think I would be, but I am.

My specialist/surgeon just said my chances of conceiving were 'very poor' and if I do, its a good chance it will be ectopic. But I don't know what this means. Am I infertile? What's the chance of ectopic? Is it worth even bothering to try naturally or am I just going to end up in surgery?!

The publically funded ivf wait list is roughly 2 1/2 years from first appointment to actual ivf treatment.

I know I'm an impatient person but this hurts the most. Knowing it's going to take me 3 years to have a baby. Ahhh.

246,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I've been lurking here for awhile now and finally bit the bullet and made an account. This is a great community and I feel supported just reading some of the posts. Let me introduce myself.

I'm almost 33. After 9 months of TTC we went to see an REI who ran all the basic tests. My husband's SA was fine, my AMH was 2.9, FSH \~4.3, and E2 was \~25. The AFC however was hard to come by (but I think showed a reasonable number of follicles), because the ultrasound showed what she thought was a gigantic fibroid blocking easy access to the ovaries. The mass was then confirmed by MRI to be a >9cm, pedunculated fibroid. A little while later I did the HSG test which, surprisingly (given no risk factors), revealed one blocked and one patent tube. A couple months later I had a laparoscopic myomectomy, during which the surgeon also did a chromopertubation test. This confirmed that I do indeed have one blocked tube and the other tube looks suspiciously like there might be beginnings of blockage in the symmetric site. No endometriosis was seen. This lead to a diagnosis of a congenital tubal factor. The tubes, at least as of the time of myomectomy, were not hydrosalpinges.

Post-myomectomy, we tried for a few more months before finally going back to see a different REI closer to home who our friend referred us to. He's supposed to be a ""hotshot"" REI, and, critically, his clinic has a well respected laboratory. He immediately agreed that the cause of infertility was tubal and suggested IVF. Two months later we decided to go for it, and signed up for the 3-round package, which gives 3 ERs and unlimited FETS until you either run out of embryos or take home a baby.

I showed up on day 2 of my cycle and my AFC was lower than it had ever been (9). The doctor said that I should not use birth control but rather wait until I ovulate and then do the estrogen priming protocol. He also suggested I retest FSH, AMH, and E2. I did, and the FSH and E2 didn't change, but my AMH had apparently plummeted to 0.89. Cue despair #1 of the process. Without getting into too many details, suffice it to say that despite the low AFC, I somehow ended up with 16 eggs which yielded 4 PGS-tested euploid blastocysts (2 day 5 and 2 day 6), and 2 low mosaics. We then waited a cycle and repeated exactly what we did, except this time my AFC was much higher (18) and they kept me on an even lower dose of gonadotropins. The second round produced 21 eggs which yielded 6 more PGS-tested euploid blastocysts (not sure about the day 5/day 6 breakdown because I haven't received the report yet) and 1 low mosaic. I don't know how to explain the discordance between the eggs retrieved/blastocysts developed and the AMH. Perhaps the AMH (and AFC) are not constant in me (though typically they only vary by <10%). Perhaps the myomectomy affected me. I haven't had it retested since then.

In between cycles I had a saline sonogram done by the surgeon who did the myomectomy which showed that I have an arcuate uterus. (He's probably the best doctor I've ever encountered). Amazingly, after I gave them this diagnosis, the REIs were also suddenly seeing the characteristic cat eyes of the arcuate uterus in ultrasound. (Confirmation bias much?) The response of my REIs was ""we should surgically resect the septum"" and ""we need to do a hysteroscopy to see how deep the septum is."" This struck me as odd since the REI was telling me that hysteroscopy is the gold standard for distinguishing arcuate and deeper septum, yet, my surgeon and research papers, etc., say that hysteroscopy doesn't tell you the depth all that well, and that MRI is much better at confirming the depth of a septum. More importantly, there really isn't evidence that resection of the dimple of the arcuate uterus does anything to improve live birth rates. Actually, all the evidence as a whole points to women with arcuate uteruses and normal uteruses having no difference in live birth rate whatsoever.

Moving on - I had another MRI, which confirmed arcuate uterus (less than 1cm septum which also matched the measurement from sonogram quite well). It also showed some surprises: an area of adenomyosis (not reported on my previous MRI but appears to have been present there too) and another tiny fibroid that was not present in the previous MRI. It also showed some cysts in my ovaries (probably because I'd only had the ER 2.5 weeks before) and a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac (apparently normal).

So, most excellent reddit form, what do I do now? I have 10 PGS-tested euploid blastocysts that are on ice. I recognize that this is a lot. If the REI had his way I'd probably be paying him another 7K+ to have the dimple resected, an ERA, and, if we were being really aggressive, taking an extended dose of Lupron or OCP to ""tame"" the adenomyosis, even though I don't think it's causing problems. Neither my surgeon nor the REI are concerned about the new fibroid. My surgeon said he of course can't be sure about the effect of the adenomyosis, but he doesn't think it's clinically relevant. The REI said he's skeptical of diagnosing me with adenomyosis only from MRI... Call me cynical if you like, but I'm just not convinced in the science behind the ERA, and as I said before, to my knowledge there really isn't evidence to back up operating on the arcuate uterus. I tried to get the REI to give me some probability of success from a PGS normal blastocyst, and he said 67-70%, and said ""subtract 10%"" for all of these new uterine findings. Honestly I'm not sure where he got that number from. I think he probably made it up. A few minutes later I asked him what he thought the source of infertility is, tubal or uterine (note that at least 15 months ago or so there was 1 patent tube, suspicious as it may have looked on chromopertubation), to which he replied ""tubal, I don't think there's a problem with your uterus"". At that point I just had to stop pulling teeth to try to get him to give the situation more than the most cursory thought.

The current plan is to try 2 FETS (since if 1 fails it's basically a coin toss and doesn't teach us much) using a ""natural"" protocol. According to my REI, there's no difference in pregnancy outcome between fully medicated and ""natural"" (which still involves triggering ovulation and progesterone supplementation) protocols, but the natural is more of a hassle as it requires more monitoring. (How surprising the REIs just automatically suggest medicated FETs!!) For some reason that's probably not entirely rational I really want to do a ""natural"" FET. I just intuitively feel better knowing I have a corpus leuteum making estrogen and progesterone. I also really hated taking the estrace and didn't want to have to take so much of it for weeks. The REI agreed to a ""natural"" FET.

If those 2 FETS fail we can go try all of these other tests (ERA, hysteroscopy), etc. We can also always do the 3rd egg retrieval to get more embryos if necessary (but I do not want to put that off too long since who knows how long my ovaries will behave).

But, this makes me feel so nervous, even with 10 blastocysts... there are still just so many unknowns. From the beginning I've always been a little doubtful of the tubal factor diagnosis, since one tube did spill. The REIs are so quick to talk about egg quality as the big problem, but luckily that did not turn out to be the issue. But maybe it really is my uterus. Maybe no embryos has ever been able to implant even if it's made it down the one open tube. Should I just do the 3rd ER now while we are likely to get more good embryos and then go for the FET?

&#x200B;

Sorry for writing a novel here, but if you've made it this far, I welcome any thoughts, opinions, advice. I can still change course! Thank you!!!

Edit: probably irrelevant but I forgot that from the first ER there were 2x 4AC blastocysts that didn’t get PGS tested but were frozen. The lab as a policy doesn’t test any blastocysts with C rated trophectoderms, and they also don’t keep BC or C.C. blasts. So I had 4x additional embryos thrown away for being poor quality. 


TLDR: 10 euploid blastocysts from 2x ER, 3x low mosaics, 2x untested 4AC blasts; probable tubal factor infertility; and new discoveries of arcuate uterus with likely adenomyosis. How to proceed? Another ER? All the tests? Try a couple of FETs and see what happens and then do another ER?

This is a great community and I feel supported just reading some of the posts. Let me introduce myself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost 33. After 9 months of TTC we went to see an REI who ran all the basic tests. My husband&#39;s SA was fine, my AMH was 2.9, FSH ~4.3, and E2 was ~25. The AFC however was hard to come by (but I think showed a reasonable number of follicles), because the ultrasound showed what she thought was a gigantic fibroid blocking easy access to the ovaries. The mass was then confirmed by MRI to be a &gt;9cm, pedunculated fibroid. A little while later I did the HSG test which, surprisingly (given no risk factors), revealed one blocked and one patent tube. A couple months later I had a laparoscopic myomectomy, during which the surgeon also did a chromopertubation test. This confirmed that I do indeed have one blocked tube and the other tube looks suspiciously like there might be beginnings of blockage in the symmetric site. No endometriosis was seen. This lead to a diagnosis of a congenital tubal factor. The tubes, at least as of the time of myomectomy, were not hydrosalpinges.</p>

<p>Post-myomectomy, we tried for a few more months before finally going back to see a different REI closer to home who our friend referred us to. He&#39;s supposed to be a &quot;hotshot&quot; REI, and, critically, his clinic has a well respected laboratory. He immediately agreed that the cause of infertility was tubal and suggested IVF. Two months later we decided to go for it, and signed up for the 3-round package, which gives 3 ERs and unlimited FETS until you either run out of embryos or take home a baby.</p>

<p>I showed up on day 2 of my cycle and my AFC was lower than it had ever been (9). The doctor said that I should not use birth control but rather wait until I ovulate and then do the estrogen priming protocol. He also suggested I retest FSH, AMH, and E2. I did, and the FSH and E2 didn&#39;t change, but my AMH had apparently plummeted to 0.89. Cue despair #1 of the process. Without getting into too many details, suffice it to say that despite the low AFC, I somehow ended up with 16 eggs which yielded 4 PGS-tested euploid blastocysts (2 day 5 and 2 day 6), and 2 low mosaics. We then waited a cycle and repeated exactly what we did, except this time my AFC was much higher (18) and they kept me on an even lower dose of gonadotropins. The second round produced 21 eggs which yielded 6 more PGS-tested euploid blastocysts (not sure about the day 5/day 6 breakdown because I haven&#39;t received the report yet) and 1 low mosaic. I don&#39;t know how to explain the discordance between the eggs retrieved/blastocysts developed and the AMH. Perhaps the AMH (and AFC) are not constant in me (though typically they only vary by &lt;10%). Perhaps the myomectomy affected me. I haven&#39;t had it retested since then.</p>

<p>In between cycles I had a saline sonogram done by the surgeon who did the myomectomy which showed that I have an arcuate uterus. (He&#39;s probably the best doctor I&#39;ve ever encountered). Amazingly, after I gave them this diagnosis, the REIs were also suddenly seeing the characteristic cat eyes of the arcuate uterus in ultrasound. (Confirmation bias much?) The response of my REIs was &quot;we should surgically resect the septum&quot; and &quot;we need to do a hysteroscopy to see how deep the septum is.&quot; This struck me as odd since the REI was telling me that hysteroscopy is the gold standard for distinguishing arcuate and deeper septum, yet, my surgeon and research papers, etc., say that hysteroscopy doesn&#39;t tell you the depth all that well, and that MRI is much better at confirming the depth of a septum. More importantly, there really isn&#39;t evidence that resection of the dimple of the arcuate uterus does anything to improve live birth rates. Actually, all the evidence as a whole points to women with arcuate uteruses and normal uteruses having no difference in live birth rate whatsoever.</p>

<p>Moving on - I had another MRI, which confirmed arcuate uterus (less than 1cm septum which also matched the measurement from sonogram quite well). It also showed some surprises: an area of adenomyosis (not reported on my previous MRI but appears to have been present there too) and another tiny fibroid that was not present in the previous MRI. It also showed some cysts in my ovaries (probably because I&#39;d only had the ER 2.5 weeks before) and a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac (apparently normal).</p>

<p>So, most excellent reddit form, what do I do now? I have 10 PGS-tested euploid blastocysts that are on ice. I recognize that this is a lot.

We had our first consultation with the IVF clinic and we were sure we wanted PICSI with PGS, but the consultant advised against both. He said that the possible improvement in odds wasn't worth the risk of damage to embryos from repeated freezing/thawing, or possible damage during biopsy.

He recommends short protocol with ICSI. We have a few weeks to decide. 

Has anyone else been advised against these treatment options?

Edit: thanks so much for all of your replies. I really appreciate it. I think I need to schedule a second consultation to clarify his advice before we decide.

Bullshit, I was 12 when you yeeted that child at me and left. And now after two more kids, jailtime, abuse, three rehabs, and 7 years of taking her then she throws a fit because you took her. You now have the state of mind to care for someone but yourself. 

This is why I have depression. And then to top it all off my body decides to tell me ""sorry but you cant have kids"". Oh and the people saying ""your too young to have a kid"" ""live your life first"" ""have fun! Your only young once!"".

As in shoves the bottle, shakes them too much, and dosen't provide neck support when caring for them.

I have my miracle dogs. They were premature and their mother didnt want them so I made it my duty to save them. I also have my cat, found her in the cold rain 2 months old infested with maggots. She took a ton of tlc. They're my furbabies and you could say Im a little over protective of them.

Sadly a furbaby... Isnt like a human baby...
No matter how much I trick myself...

Why cant I have both? Why can't I have ALL my babies?

Just can't... I even tried fornicating every other day for two months. An sense I have an irregular period and three diffrent pregnancy tests came up undefined I thought I was pregnant, hints why we have a room ready.

I've always had depression... Got better when I raised my niece. I could feel pride as I held her, taught her lifes basics, and when she called me mommy... Now she just calls me Katana... Sometimes slipping up and calling me mom... I can't have her, my sister is doing so well! No matter how much she asks everyone... She cant live with me.

People tell me I dont understand what its like to have my own kids... People tell me Im too young... People even judge and say Im not ready because of my depression... Depression doesnt define me, and yet to them it does. They think its fine until they look at my history of depression... Then another rejection. Im not an unhinged lunatic, Im just sad most of the time. 

After all the shit life puts me through, now that I found a partner, who loves and supports me. I cant even start a life with them... I cant even afford my fertility treatments... I still have to wait for the fucking district manager to accept me and schedule me for orientation!

I feel like garbage, I cant do anything right. I cant even do what comes naturally. I cant enjoy sex, I cant be happy. i cant even tear down my walls, instead I build a door and window.

I don't ovulate on oral medications.  My RE has me coming in for a hysterosonogram during my next cycle.  After that, we move onto injectibles.

At my appointment last week, he mentioned we were going to do ""low and slow,"" with the injections, which I am A-OK with.  He gave us the option of going the IUI route, but he didn't think that the benefits from it would be worth the trouble (I live a little over an hour away from him).  He also mentioned that we could skip forward to IVF if we wanted to, but he didn't think it was necessary yet.

My husband and I walked away, planning on doing the injectibles and trying naturally.  Now, I'm having second thoughts.

If we're going low and slow, it may be months before I ovulate, if I even do at all.  That's so much money thrown away. 

Our clinic has a shared risk pool for IVF.  For about $20k + meds, we'd get 6 IVF cycles and unlimited FET transfers.

IVF would, obviously cost way more than if we got lucky with injectibles, but I'm worried about being able to afford both if injectibles don't work on their own.

I'm also not sure how to bring this up with my husband right now.  IVF has always seemed so far away.  Now, suddenly, I want to move it up to just a couple cycles away.  He's been so supportive of me every step of the way, and I feel badly dropping this bomb on him.

Unfortunately our experience has not been as positive as many of the people who have posted here that have worked with this pharmacy. We ordered our meds and wired the money on April 18th.

Welcome to the Infertility Results thread and discussion! You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. 

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top ""Read This"" sticky on the main page.** For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, r/InfertilityBabies.

<p>***I&#39;m very new to this all. Any advice would be greatly appreciated</p>
