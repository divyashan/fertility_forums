9,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello all, 

I've posted here before. I had a couple of miscarriages due to failed IVFs.  The first one felt almost like a normal period, but the second one took 11+ weeks to pass. I had no idea it would take that long, so in the efforts of avoiding more procedures and going to the hospital, I opted to not have a D&C. The entire time I was depressed, and on some days would just collapse and sob uncontrollably. I had regular visits to a gynecologist during this miscarriage, and she discovered a 9mm cyst on my right ovary that was not there before. Both her and the RE said it was probably going to go away on its own, and just needs to be monitored. But to me it was yet another crushing blow. My body did not feel like my own, and I constantly felt it was attacking me.

During this entire period, I had to keep going back to the lab to monitor my blood levels, and deal with the bleeding, and this cyst. I nearly had a mental breakdown. The arguments between my husband and I intensified during this period, where he felt I needed to move on, because crying isn't going to make anything better, which I guess is true.  But I didn't know how to just stop being sad.

After the bleeding finally stopped, I went back to the RE to make sure everything was OK. The 9mm cyst disappeared as they predicted, but now there is a polyp in my uterus that again was not there before. RE recommended surgery, and I just wanted to kill myself at that point... I chose alternative medicine instead, and drastically changed my diet according to the alternative medicine clinic's directions. Luckily, the polyp went away after 3 months without surgery.  

I convinced my husband to go to the alternative medicine clinic as well in hopes to improve his sperm quality. During the first 3 months, he lost a lot of weight on the new diet they put him on. Due to the success I had with my polyp, we expected to see some improvement on his sperm as well. However, when he went to check his sperm, every aspect of it got worse. The doctors suspect it might be due to the weight loss, so we gave it 3 more months to try again. We are waiting the results of his latest analysis now.

Since all this started, my husband and I have argued on and off. At the root of every argument is that he wants me to deal with my emotions more positively, and accept that shit happens in life. I do still cry every time we talk about this, and understand his frustration. But the repeated shouting matches made me doubt everything I do because I accepted his criticism that I cannot face reality. I feel that ultimately I was the one that had to endure all the drugs and treatments of IVF, and the fallout after. I also felt completely alone in the process simply because of the biology of our genders. I cannot face another IVF, and am scared of doing even IUI and miscarrying again. I cannot go through yet another spout of crippling depression. 

I've asked my husband for a divorce, which he did not want to get. I love him, but it is becoming more apparent that he will not be happy without a child in his life. I am also a broken wreck after all this, and don't even feel like myself anymore. In a way I feel the only chance I have at rebuilding myself is either become pregnant right this minute, or leave him. I am chickenshit and know if I get a divorce on my own without his agreement, I will regret it for the rest of my life. What should I do?

**TL;DR:** Husband wants to continue treatment after 2 miscarriages. I can't face it. Divorce or go through with more treatment?

**UPDATE:** Thanks for all your kind words and advice. The results on his sperm came back. No improvement.

My body did not feel like my own, and I constantly felt it was attacking me.</p>

<p>During this entire period, I had to keep going back to the lab to monitor my blood levels, and deal with the bleeding, and this cyst. I nearly had a mental breakdown. The arguments between my husband and I intensified during this period, where he felt I needed to move on, because crying isn&#39;t going to make anything better, which I guess is true.  But I didn&#39;t know how to just stop being sad.</p>

<p>After the bleeding finally stopped, I went back to the RE to make sure everything was OK. The 9mm cyst disappeared as they predicted, but now there is a polyp in my uterus that again was not there before. RE recommended surgery, and I just wanted to kill myself at that point... I chose alternative medicine instead, and drastically changed my diet according to the alternative medicine clinic&#39;s directions. Luckily, the polyp went away after 3 months without surgery.  </p>

<p>I convinced my husband to go to the alternative medicine clinic as well in hopes to improve his sperm quality. During the first 3 months, he lost a lot of weight on the new diet they put him on. Due to the success I had with my polyp, we expected to see some improvement on his sperm as well. However, when he went to check his sperm, every aspect of it got worse. The doctors suspect it might be due to the weight loss, so we gave it 3 more months to try again. We are waiting the results of his latest analysis now.</p>

<p>Since all this started, my husband and I have argued on and off. At the root of every argument is that he wants me to deal with my emotions more positively, and accept that shit happens in life. I do still cry every time we talk about this, and understand his frustration. But the repeated shouting matches made me doubt everything I do because I accepted his criticism that I cannot face reality. I feel that ultimately I was the one that had to endure all the drugs and treatments of IVF, and the fallout after. I also felt completely alone in the process simply because of the biology of our genders. I cannot face another IVF, and am scared of doing even IUI and miscarrying again. I cannot go through yet another spout of crippling depression. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked my husband for a divorce, which he did not want to get. I love him, but it is becoming more apparent that he will not be happy without a child in his life. I am also a broken wreck after all this, and don&#39;t even feel like myself anymore. In a way I feel the only chance I have at rebuilding myself is either become pregnant right this minute, or leave him. I am chickenshit and know if I get a divorce on my own without his agreement, I will regret it for the rest of my life. What should I do?</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Husband wants to continue treatment after 2 miscarriages. I can&#39;t face it. Divorce or go through with more treatment?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks for all your kind words and advice. The results on his sperm came back. No improvement. A kick in the teeth is an understatement.</p>

Today was our WTF appt with the RE. There was nothing in the bloodwork or test results to explain why our IVF #1 failed. Lining was fine, hormone levels fine. I had good eggs, my husband had some good sperm amongst the not-so-good (we call them his 'mutant sperm'), so we made good embryos. Overall the RE was really happy with everything in the cycle excepting the negative beta. She thinks it was just an embryo that wasn't meant to take. So that's a relief in a way. We asked about further testing (PGD etc) but she said she'd prefer to wait on that. If the frozen transfers fail then she said we could look at those options. 

We're going to a FET with my next cycle (CD1 due 1/29) and she wants to keep it as natural as possible. No blood tests/scans until about CD9, then every few days until they can pinpoint ovulation (I might also need a boost of FSH depending on the results) & then a transfer 5 days later. Then progesterone pessaries until the beta. So much less invasive than last time, thank goodness. Also I have to increase my metformin dose to 1000mg to try and reduce the length of my cycle a bit more (current cycle is around 34 days). So potentially a *wonderful* few days of nausea and diarrhoea coming up :/

Last week we had a sudden and devastating death of a young person in my family. I had to scramble and go into the red on my vacation days to get back home for the funeral. I was there but I'm still not 100% convinced she's really gone. But sometimes I am 100% convinced she's really gone and then I feel so, so horrible. For me, for her family, for her. She was only 20. The shock of her death seemed to put IF grief on hold for a minute, but now (thanks to a couple of new babies and pregnancy announcements among friends) it's back and feels worse than before.

Failing 2 IUIs seemed like some kind of Rubicon, maybe from fucked to really fucked (with the knowledge that really, really fucked is next). I didn't schedule #3 for this month because I am too overwhelmed. I am taking the femara but I don't know if I can manage OPKs and TI or not. I mean, like it matters -- it's plainly not going to work. 

I'm worried about my poor husband. He is so good to me. He's had to be so good so many times in the last year. Now, after this death, I hold it together all day and just lose my shit when I get home, either crying and crying or just saying horrible dark things.

He said, ""we'll have a baby,"" and I just said, ""yeah I doubt it,"" really coldly and went back to reading my book. What a shitty exchange for him to have to participate in. I don't act that negative around anyone else. I want to go to couples therapy just so I can say how bad I feel about what I'm putting him through in front of an official witness.

It&#39;s not attached to me, to my pants, to my underwear...anything. It&#39;s the magical mystery pad! My underwear look like they were used to clean up a snuffcore film set, too, and I liked them. :( </p>

My husband and I are just approaching the one year mark of TTC, and just had a failed IUI cycle. We were able to start seeing an RE in October after 7/8 months of trying because my OB was unable or unwilling to help us deal with a luteal phase defect, and insisted I must be ""counting wrong.""  My ""CD21"" blood work said my progesterone was under 2. It was also the day before my period arrived because of the short luteal phase. 

The RE put me on clomid (50mg) and progesterone suppositories 2x day. I had two failed cycles with that protocol and then had an HSG (all clear) and hubs had an SA (also normal) and we moved onto 100mg of clomid, HCG trigger shot, and IUI. Which failed. All the monitoring looked good during the IUI (follicles, lining, etc). 

So now, we need to decide what to do next. We're moving to another state in February. Initially I didn't think we had time for another IUI (we'd be cutting it close) but my start date at the new job just got pushed back at least another week, which should give us enough time for another IUI cycle. 

Here's the thing- I know IUI has low success rates. Lower than the normal success for a ""normal"" fertile couple. If my husbands SA was normal, and there are no other ""problems"" besides my progesterone issues (presumably solved by the supplements), is an IUI worth it? It doesn't actually bring the chances down right?

70,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So with all the nausea and bloating I've been experiencing, I saw my doctor today (transfer would have been tomorrow). The ultrasound revealed that there is fluid building up in my abdominal cavity and that my ovaries are twice as large as normal. She said she'd call this a moderate case of OHSS.


She told me that she thinks we need to freeze my 5 embryos (that she said are still doing well as of today) and come back in a month for a frozen transfer.


I'm a tad disappointed because I'm just an impatient person, but I was very relieved to hear this would be a freeze-all cycle. OHSS only gets worse with pregnancy and I didn't want to feel much worse than I do now, much less risking anything with a baby.


My homework for today is to continue chugging the Gatorade (she knows how awful it is and I never want to see it again after this) and to eat salty things like potato chips, V8, broth, etc. I suppose I can deal with that.


I thought I'd be super disappointed if this happened, but I have a good feeling about it. Yesterday when I thought we were still on for tomorrow, I had a very bad gut feeling and thought about opting for a freeze-all cycle myself. But now that she thinks it's best, I'm happy with it.

The ultrasound revealed that there is fluid building up in my abdominal cavity and that my ovaries are twice as large as normal. She said she&#39;d call this a moderate case of OHSS.</p>

<p>She told me that she thinks we need to freeze my 5 embryos (that she said are still doing well as of today) and come back in a month for a frozen transfer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a tad disappointed because I&#39;m just an impatient person, but I was very relieved to hear this would be a freeze-all cycle. OHSS only gets worse with pregnancy and I didn&#39;t want to feel much worse than I do now, much less risking anything with a baby.</p>

<p>My homework for today is to continue chugging the Gatorade (she knows how awful it is and I never want to see it again after this) and to eat salty things like potato chips, V8, broth, etc. I suppose I can deal with that.</p>

<p>I thought I&#39;d be super disappointed if this happened, but I have a good feeling about it. Yesterday when I thought we were still on for tomorrow, I had a very bad gut feeling and thought about opting for a freeze-all cycle myself.

I suppose the TL;DR is that my oldest friend of 15 years has completely cut me out of her life (with no explanation) but I can only guess that it is because she is pregnant and I am not.

My friend B. and I have been friends for 15 years. The dynamic of our relationship has been me coming to her rescue and supporting her. There's really never been much room for my problems, but I accepted that because I loved her. She recently went through a horrendous break up with an abusive boyfriend that included a suicide attempt and even though we live on opposite sides of the country, I still did all  I could for her. I was going to have her live with my husband and I (rent free) to get a fresh start. She didn't decide to move here, but she was in therapy and doing better it seemed. A few months later, she started dating someone. Three months into that relationship - surprise pregnancy.

She never really wanted children of her own, but had been compassionate about my infertility (in her way) and told me how sorry she was for us. When she announced her pregnancy, I could feel her guilt, which made me think how much she cared. Hell, I appreciated her being honest and candid. But what came next, I didn't expect.

She began asking me questions about pregnancy, including how 'would she know if she was miscarrying' - presumably because she knew that I had been through it. I was there for her and answered everything I could for her. Then, the questions evolved to dietary restrictions, her symptoms, and etc. I honestly couldn't handle it. Every symptom of hers reminded me of everything I have lost. I communicated my feelings to her via an e-mail that took me over 3 hours to write because I was so afraid to hurt her feelings. She was actively hurting me and promised that she would try not to talk to me about those things but she's 'so used to telling me everything that she cant help it'. 

I have to say that things were good for a while. She maintained her boundaries. We started talking about other topics - I even asked for her to keep me updated about her ultrasounds and eventually the babies sex. We even had non-baby related conversations that were fun and silly like normal. Then one day, we were talking about work when she told me that her boyfriend sent her the nicest message. I was typing out ""Oh that's sweet of him"" but before I knew it, she had sent his message to her, to me. It read,  ""I think you're still just as beautiful as the day I met you, even more at times when I look at your belly and can see our baby and think about the nice little family we're starting.""

This is about where I had a major emotional breakdown. I lost my job of 8 years (and thus, the ability to save for our IVF) and then this treatment from her. She knew I had even been having intrusive thoughts, but didn't think twice about how I'd receive a message like that. I couldn't believe that she would bring that up. This is where my husband messaged her on Facebook to ask her to please stop and to respect my wishes because I just cant handle the pregnancy talk. He's never intervened on my behalf in 8 years, but he figured that if she wouldn't listen to me that maybe she'd listen to him. He got the same excuses about how she ""couldn't help it"" and that she was ""sorry"" and hadn't even ""announced her pregnancy because she was afraid of how it would hurt me"". 

After this, things were tense as first but they became okay for quite a while. We talked a lot, I started a new job in November, the holidays happened, and she even donated to our IVF fund on the 30th of December. Then, on January 8th I went to send her a funny message on Facebook when I saw that she was no longer in my friends list. I went to her page and saw that we were no longer friends. I told my Husband how weird that was, and we discovered that she has removed him as well. I sent her a message and text that asked her about why she unfriended us, and asked her if we needed to talk. She hasn't answered. 

I put up the boundaries I did in the beginning to protect myself. I've had almost the same boundaries set with several other pregnant friends and all have taken it perfectly. I dont think I need to say here (you guys know) that I have actively tried to be happy for her, but I'm also just so very sad for me. 

I said from the beginning that I understand how it must hurt her, and that I am sorry that I cant be there for her through her pregnancy. I can appreciate how hard it is to not share it with someone important to you. I did everything I could to consider her feelings - so where was the reciprocation there?

At this point, I'm not sure if anyone is even reading still - but if anyone can understand this I know you guys will. I had heard that this can happen, as almost an infertile vs fertile thing, but experiencing it has been hard.

That said, I had an HSG nine months ago and while I guess I could have physically driven myself home from that, I wound up achy, crampy, a little teary, and very, very glad that hubby came with.  Now I&#39;m doubting my tough-girl attitude.  </p>

<p>The RE&#39;s office is literally around the corner from my house, and hubby says that if I really feel like I need to get loopy on Ativan before the procedure to make it a little more tolerable to call and he&#39;ll pick me up.  My mom will also go with me in a heartbeat - all I need to do is ask.  But I&#39;ve hated being a burden and a downer to everyone in my life since October and I don&#39;t want to act like I need help and support when all that means is driving me down the street and twiddling your thumbs in a waiting room while I girt my teeth and say &quot;ow-ow-ow&quot; for 30 seconds and then we&#39;re done.  </p>

<p>Anyway, ramble over.  Just let me know whether I should be seeking support for this or whether I can go myself.  </p>

Here's our story. My husband has an autoimmune disorder that was treated with cyclophosphomide (an intense chemotherapy he took orally for a year). Now married 5 plus years, his sperm was tested and he is completely sterile. His FSH levels show he is most likely not producing sperm. Our only option is a TESE surgery in which they extract testicular tubules and scrape them out and search for sperm. If any are found,  they are frozen and given to me via IVF. 

Our chances of finding any are so low they actually discouraged the surgery but my husband is adamant. He won't move on to adoption unless he knows for sure, but I am afraid (and certain) that his grieving process will begin all over again if nothing is there. Anyone had a similar experience? 

I'm also dealing with my brother and sister in law telling me that they know how we feel because they might not be able to have kids either. This is NOT true. She was discouraged from trying while treating an illness with a particular medicine. Basically,  she has to wait a few months to begin trying. I clarified this with her. She covered by saying ""yeah but I'm in the same boat because I can't right now."" I'm not a violent person but holy geez it took so much not to slap her. Sigh. 

Rant over.

**Edit: 20 retrieved, 12 mature, only 5 fertilized. I'm crushed.**


I took my HCG (pregnancy hormone) trigger shot on Wednesday night, and felt too queasy to eat all day Thursday.

We left the house at about 8 and talked about anything but what we were headed off to do. We got there and waited for a total of 5 minutes before we were led into a room where I could change into a backless gown, a hair net, and some booties. Husband snapped a couple of pictures of me like this and got a little choked up, seeing that this big thing was really happening. I was too nervous at the moment to get choked up. Then they took him away to contribute to his half.

The nurses brought me into a little area with a nice recliner and took my vitals and double-checked I had no medicine allergies. I made idle chat with a couple of different ladies (I couldn't tell them apart because each one was dressed in scrubs, hair nets and a mask) and one of them hooked me up to an IV, which was truly the most painful part of this whole thing. My hand...ouch. They pumped some anti-nausea meds through and some form of advil and an antibiotic. 

My doctor came in and quickly summarized what they would be doing (I already knew) and told me she'd call me today (Saturday) to tell me how many eggs fertilized. Then the nurses all escorted me into the rather intimidating operating room and had me lay down on the table.

""Okay, we're going to put some anesthesia through now."" Someone said. The ceiling tiles and florescent lights began to spin. I asked if they were aware that that was happening, and that's the last thing I remember before someone was waking me up. I asked if they started yet and they said they were already done. This made me laugh pretty hysterically (apparently it's normal for women to be laughing or crying when they wake up). 

**Then someone told me I had 20 eggs retrieved!** I sat in the recovery chair and kind of drifted off again before they let me go get dressed. I met up with Bill and a nurse and they gave us some post-op instructions. My teeth wouldn't stop chattering, and they said it was from the anesthesia. 

I was also in no pain! I'm having a lot of the symptoms I read about....bloating and constipation most notably.

105,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Welp. After lurking around here for a while, I decided to just take the plunge and introduce myself. My husband and I will be 28 this year and we've been trying since May 2013. 

After six months of trying, I went to my OBGYN with concerns. I told her that I thought maybe I had an LP defect (I was charting at the time and it seemed I only got about 8-10 days every month.) She didn't want to hear that and ordered CD 3 testing on me...on the 10th day. When I raised concerns, she basically said I didn't know what I was talking about. She then ordered a SA on my husband. 

That night, I posted in Facebook that I wanted to another OBGYN because I wasn't happy with my current one. Well, when I went back to get my test results, she basically went off about how much it hurt her feelings because I wanted to find another doctor. UM WHAT? Anyway, she said I was fine but my husband was not and that we needed to see a urologist because she couldn't help me. 

Well, I looked up his results and...they seemed to be fine. I then made an appointment with an RE because this wackadoodle would not be any help. 

Fast forward a couple of months and we finally got into the RE's office. My husband's SA IS fine, so now we're looking at me. I've had an HSG--fine. My testing, though on the wrong day, didn't raise any alarms. I _am_ ovulating on my own, so that's go too. I'm just not getting pregnant.

We did one round of Femara + ovidrel. When I went in, I had a follicle that was  20mm, but my lining was only 5mm. So he immediately started me on estradoil. But I didn't even make it to my testing date. I started my period early. I was completely and totally devastated. That was back in July. For a while, I didn't want to try again. I had just given up. But in December, we went back to discuss what happened. My RE now thinks that there may be an issue with my estrogen levels because of my low BMI (18) which is making for a poor ovulation and lining. We were supposed to do another medicated cycle before Christmas, but I decided to wait because I just started a new teaching job and the stress would have been too much. 

Now, I just keep flopping between being hopeful (the RE will start me on estradoil sooner in the cycle, and he's splitting up the Femara instead of doing a massive dose like the first time) and becoming more and more concerned about never conceiving. We don't have a real reason. Everything is guess work. Even with spending $900 every medicated cycle, we only have a 20% chance of becoming pregnant. Time is ticking. We're getting older. I always wanted at least two children, and now I don't even know if I'll get one. 

Which brings me to the question I hate: ""So. Do you have children?"" 
""Nope."" 
""Oh, well, so do you WANT children?""

...why do people find this appropriate?! I just can't understand the constant bombardment of questions dealing with such a personal aspect of someone's life. And if people find out you can't get pregnant? Oh. Well, then they HAVE to tell you about this diet/this plan/this natural doctor/how one time their cousin's wife's cousin three times removed got pregnant when they gave up! 

Ugh. Basically this wall of text is because I'm feeling alone this morning and I just want to be in touch with people who understand.

109,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'm so weak. 

I got my official diagnosis in November that I don't ovulate at all. I handled it well. No breakdown or freak out. We had a game plan for Letrozole, Ovidrel, and progesterone suppositories and knowing that kept me feeling confident. We finally started treatment this month when my period finally decided to show up (40-75 cycle, never know what you're gonna get). 

Letrozole sucked.
Ovidrel sucked.
These suppositories suck.

So. Many. Fucking. Side effects. I was emotional, I had a headache for almost a week straight. Diarrhea. Hot flashes. Cramping. The list goes on with each new drug. I'm 12 days past my trigger and got a negative this morning. I'll test again tomorrow but honestly, it's probably still a negative...and I'm already fed up. I don't know how some of you do this long term and stay sane. I feel weak and insecure for feeling like ""why the fuck should I go on with this shit??"". I know it'll be worth it once you get that positive. But what if it never comes? All that stress. All those hormones. All those side effects from treatments. For how long? Months? Years? Until you lose your mind?

So I finally had my first cry about all of this since the diagnosis from the RE. I'm stressed and scared about the uncertainty of all of this. I like plans and this is all a shot in the dark. So, I've been having a nice long cry all night. My poor, poor husband. He has no idea what to tell me.

So, what do I do next? Take a couple months off to catch my breath and mentally prepare for doing this long term? But who has time to waste when your body fucking hates you and won't work? So do I move on with treatment again whenever my next cycle shows up and just learn to deal with this emotional roller coaster? 

Again, I see how long some of you go through this and I'm in awe. You are so strong. I'm can't believe I'm feeling so ""done"" with it so quickly. 

I guess it doesn't help that my career is that of a birth professional and so it all feels like a huge slap in the face every time I see my pregnant clients. Oh the irony of it all.

I guess I don't know what I'm even asking. Is this normal to feel after the first month? Overwhelmed. Stressed. Scared. Wanting to quit before you've barely even begun. 

Blegh. Word (paragraphs) vomit. Sorry. My husband is just speechless and says he'll support whatever I decide but he admits it's hard for him to understand/empathize with what I'm going through, which is why I'm reaching out to you all. I think he'd rather keep his mouth shut than say the wrong thing. Good man. He just holds my hand and let's me cry, and I'm okay with that for now. 

UPDATE:
Wow. I'm blown away.  Your responses have been so very helpful in my processing all of this.  Taking the time to respond with such kind words and genuine support is so unbelievably helpful right now as I really have no friends to talk to about all of this.  I think I needed this ""blow"" to force me to process this diagnoses and to acknowledge what it could really mean for me and my husband.  I am so, so thankful for your words and will be taking the next few days to process & decide what we'll do next.  I know I'm not ready to give up, I just don't know that I'm ready to move on so quickly.  Maybe a few months off is in order.  We shall see.

It means the world to me. Thank you.",t2_a3hy8,False,,0,False,One month meltdown,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_2rxbfi,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,self,1420911532.0,,[],{},,True,,1420885666.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so weak. </p>

<p>I got my official diagnosis in November that I don&#39;t ovulate at all. I handled it well. No breakdown or freak out. We had a game plan for Letrozole, Ovidrel, and progesterone suppositories and knowing that kept me feeling confident. We finally started treatment this month when my period finally decided to show up (40-75 cycle, never know what you&#39;re gonna get). </p>

<p>Letrozole sucked.
Ovidrel sucked.
These suppositories suck.</p>

<p>So. Many. Fucking. Side effects. I was emotional, I had a headache for almost a week straight. Diarrhea. Hot flashes. Cramping. The list goes on with each new drug. I&#39;m 12 days past my trigger and got a negative this morning. I&#39;ll test again tomorrow but honestly, it&#39;s probably still a negative...and I&#39;m already fed up. I don&#39;t know how some of you do this long term and stay sane. I feel weak and insecure for feeling like &quot;why the fuck should I go on with this shit??&quot;. I know it&#39;ll be worth it once you get that positive. But what if it never comes? All that stress. All those hormones. All those side effects from treatments. For how long? Months? Years? Until you lose your mind?</p>

<p>So I finally had my first cry about all of this since the diagnosis from the RE. I&#39;m stressed and scared about the uncertainty of all of this. I like plans and this is all a shot in the dark. So, I&#39;ve been having a nice long cry all night. My poor, poor husband. He has no idea what to tell me.</p>

<p>So, what do I do next? Take a couple months off to catch my breath and mentally prepare for doing this long term? But who has time to waste when your body fucking hates you and won&#39;t work? So do I move on with treatment again whenever my next cycle shows up and just learn to deal with this emotional roller coaster? </p>

<p>Again, I see how long some of you go through this and I&#39;m in awe. You are so strong. I&#39;m can&#39;t believe I&#39;m feeling so &quot;done&quot; with it so quickly. </p>

<p>I guess it doesn&#39;t help that my career is that of a birth professional and so it all feels like a huge slap in the face every time I see my pregnant clients. Oh the irony of it all.</p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m even asking. Is this normal to feel after the first month? Overwhelmed. Stressed. Scared. Wanting to quit before you&#39;ve barely even begun. </p>

<p>Blegh. Word (paragraphs) vomit. Sorry. My husband is just speechless and says he&#39;ll support whatever I decide but he admits it&#39;s hard for him to understand/empathize with what I&#39;m going through, which is why I&#39;m reaching out to you all. I think he&#39;d rather keep his mouth shut than say the wrong thing. Good man. He just holds my hand and let&#39;s me cry, and I&#39;m okay with that for now. </p>

I had my third and final monitoring appointment today because Monday my follicles were too small still.

Today, Day 10 of stimming, my follicles were as such: 

Right ovary(7 over 14mm): 19.5, 17, 15, 15, 14.5, 14, 13.5, 13, 14.8, 13, 12.5, 12.5, 12, 11.5, 11, 10, 10 (and a few littler ones)

Left ovary(7 over 14mm): 20, 17, 17, 16, 14.5, 14.5, 14, 13.5, 13, 12.5, 12, 10, 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8 (and a few littler ones)

My E2 today was 2371, and Monday (day 8) it was 1227, and Friday (day 5) it was 410.6.


So, not a whole heck of a lot of follicles but I need to remember...quality over quantity.


The nurse seemed pretty sure I was at risk for OHSS because of all the small to mid-sized follicles I have, and so they're giving me 5000mg of HCG for my trigger instead of the 10,000mg dose. No Lupron.

That, and they're giving me a drug called Dostinex to help ward off OHSS. The nurse said that if I were to get OHSS, I need to mentally prepare myself for a freeze-all cycle. She said to start downing the Gatorade now - Glacier Freeze is the flavor of the day because it's -25 windchill where I am. I've also started Colace early and it's helped a ton because there's not a lot of room down there for anything but ovaries. 

Trigger shot at 11 p.m. tonight and egg retrieval is scheduled for Friday at 9 a.m.

I've never been put under before so I'm pretty nervous. I'm also nervous about any nausea, OHSS itself, and cancelling the transfer (though it wouldn't be the end of the world). 


I've also been given the choice of 3 different types of Progesterone: Progesterone in Oil, which is about $4 per daily dose; Crinone gel 1x per day for about $14 per dose; and Endometrin suppository 2x per day at $6 per dose. Any preference, ladies? 

Also, any calming words would be so, so, so appreciated. This community has already given me so much support and knowledge and the nurses seem impressed with how much I know about the process. I thank all of you!

<p>My E2 today was 2371, and Monday (day 8) it was 1227, and Friday (day 5) it was 410.6.</p>

<p>So, not a whole heck of a lot of follicles but I need to remember...quality over quantity.</p>

<p>The nurse seemed pretty sure I was at risk for OHSS because of all the small to mid-sized follicles I have, and so they&#39;re giving me 5000mg of HCG for my trigger instead of the 10,000mg dose. No Lupron.</p>

<p>That, and they&#39;re giving me a drug called Dostinex to help ward off OHSS. The nurse said that if I were to get OHSS, I need to mentally prepare myself for a freeze-all cycle. She said to start downing the Gatorade now - Glacier Freeze is the flavor of the day because it&#39;s -25 windchill where I am. I&#39;ve also started Colace early and it&#39;s helped a ton because there&#39;s not a lot of room down there for anything but ovaries. </p>

<p>Trigger shot at 11 p.m. tonight and egg retrieval is scheduled for Friday at 9 a.m.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been put under before so I&#39;m pretty nervous. I&#39;m also nervous about any nausea, OHSS itself, and cancelling the transfer (though it wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been given the choice of 3 different types of Progesterone: Progesterone in Oil, which is about $4 per daily dose; Crinone gel 1x per day for about $14 per dose; and Endometrin suppository 2x per day at $6 per dose. Any preference, ladies? </p>

<p>Also, any calming words would be so, so, so appreciated. This community has already given me so much support and knowledge and the nurses seem impressed with how much I know about the process. I thank all of you!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks for all the comments, folks! It really has helped me calm down a little.</p>

I didn't think I'd get many answers on TFAB since most ladies there are new to all of this, and I also mod /r/ttcafterloss but we're not super active yet. I'm not officially dealing with infertility, but I was wondering if any of you are hypothyroid or been diagnosed with an abnormal uterine shape and could maybe give me more information on how these issues affect TTC, or your personal stories. 

For some background, I'm 28 and my husband is 32. I got pregnant in February 2014 after 4 months of actively trying (plus 2-3 of NTNP). Unfortunately, at our 20 week anatomy scan, we found out our son had kidney defects. It took 7 weeks of flying across the state to see specialists for us to get a clear diagnosis - he had urethral stenosis that led to complete kidney failure. At 27 weeks I had no amniotic fluid left and the doctors told me the prognosis was grave, most likely fatal. We chose to terminate the pregnancy this past August.

We're now starting our 5th month of TTC after the termination, with no luck so far. Every month since my loss, I've had pain during ovulation - which never occurred before I was pregnant. During my cycles in November and December, the pain lasted from ovulation until my period. It was like a fullness/pressure in my pelvis and sometimes my rectum. My doctor suspected cysts so I had a pelvic ultrasound last month. 

They didn't find any cysts, but the ultrasound showed that my uterus was abnormally shaped - word for word the report says ""there is central indentation of the fundal endometrial cavity representing arcuate or septate uterus - suspect arcuate or subseptate"". My OB said if I'm not pregnant by cycle 8 he would recommend an ultrasound where they inject saline into the uterus to get a better idea of the shape. I still don't know what the pain was from - I don't think abnormal uterine shape causes pain(?). He told me he thinks it was just ""normal ovulation pain"", but I think it's pretty weird that it lasted weeks. Thankfully it didn't happen again this past cycle. 

In addition to that, I have hypothyroidism - Hashimoto's. I've been diagnosed since I was 17. When I got pregnant last year, my levels were normal, but I had to increase my dose quite a bit during the pregnancy. After my loss we had a lot of trouble getting the dose back down to normal so I was technically hyperthyroid for the first 3 cycles of trying. My last blood draw was a couple weeks ago and my t4 was normal (1.5 or so) but my TSH was a bit low (0.4). My doctor decreased my Levothyroxine dose by a little bit and I'll get tested again in a few weeks. 

Anyway, I guess I'd like to know if anyone here has dealt with these problems, and if your doctors have told you if they affect fertility or not. I've read that hypothyroidism only affects fertility if your dosage is off - does anyone know if this is true? In that case - what about *overmedicated* hypothyroidism leading to hyperthyroidism? Also, I've read conflicting info on whether or not arcuate uteruses are a medical issue or a normal finding. I know that septate uteruses cause issues with implantation and early miscarriage - so I'm hoping that's not what I have. I know I was pregnant before - but I still worry that perhaps that was a lucky fluke and it'll be harder this time. 

Anyway thanks for any information you can provide and thanks for reading.

The ultrasound tech was someone I hadn't met before in all the times I'd been in the clinic. She was incredibly short with me and not at all comforting. I know her job isn't technically to make me feel comfortable, but a little compassion would have been nice. At one point she noted how my legs were shaking, and I told her it was because I was nervous. And she said ""well, I don't know why"" very curtly. Another moment, I winced in pain because my ovaries are gigantic and she pressed against my left one. She asked why I winced and I told her, ""my left ovary hurts."" So she said, ""well, I'm looking at your uterus [with the ultrasound probe], not your ovary.""


*Well, it still hurts when you rub up against it! I would have said something back, but you want to be nice to the people who have tools in you.*


I had only 12 follicles that look like they're growing. In order to take my trigger shot, which prepares my follicles for retrieval 36 hours later, I have to have at least a couple of follicles over 18mm and the rest need to be at least 14mm.


Today, most of them were about 12/13mm and the smaller ones were 9mm and above. I had a rogue follicle on my left ovary that was 16mm, so I guess it's more ""ready to go"" than the others.


I was told that I need to keep taking my medications and they'll see me again on Wednesday for a third monitoring appointment (bye, $460). I'm guessing they think this will be trigger day.


Speaking of appropriate - at least my hormone levels are appropriate for the 8th day of stimming, and she said that the reason my headaches are so persistent is because my estrogen has tripled from Friday - it's 1227, and on Friday it was 400-something. So, it's only going to get better from here. Ow. Oh, and Ibuprofen is not allowed. My LH and progesterone are low too, so it's a good sign.


And I gotta tell you - my ovaries are palpable from the inside. I feel like if I move too fast or lay at a weird angle, my ovaries complain. It kind of hurts in there, and the follicles need to grow by 5 or 6mm still. So, as with the estrogen headaches, it's only going to get better from here.


I'm a bit disappointed because I thought I would be triggering today to have my retrieval on Wednesday, but I have to wait two more days longer than I hoped. That's 4 more days of headaches, ovary pain, bloating, mood swings, fatigue, etc. Sorry to be a whiner but this isn't the most pleasant thing I've ever gone through...


I'm also disappointed because 12 follicles don't seem like a lot, especially when they're only 12/13mm. I have two days to get them up to 18mm? I have my doubts.



Edit: Also...I'm already having a hard time going to the bathroom, either #1 or #2. I feel like it's because my ovaries take up too much room.
