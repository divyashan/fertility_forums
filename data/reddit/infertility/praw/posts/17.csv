I kept taking hydrocodone and naproxen until it knocked me out and we arrived 6 hours later the pain wasn&#39;t gone but it was managed a few hours later. One of the worst parts about this is I got stuck with a 1K ambulance bill because I was out of network for my insurance. So I&#39;m sorry. I really wanted to donate again. But it&#39;s too hard. </p>

Up until now I've been seeing my urologist and there's been a lot of waiting to see if Clomid helped my sperm count (it did, significantly).

I'm very happy to finally be ""doing"" something by going to see a RE. I hope they don't find any problems on my wife's side and we can just proceed with IUIs.

The tricky part is, it is going to make it awfully hard to keep a secret from my parents. We live in Flagstaff AZ, which is small enough that there are no REs in town so we have to drive 2.5 hours to Phoenix. My parents, who normally live in the midwest, are currently renting a condo in Phoenix for the winter. So for the next few months, we are likely looking at multiple long drives down to Phoenix to see an RE, just miles from where my parents are staying. It would make things a whole lot easier to tell them and be able to crash at their condo so we could drive down at night for an AM appointment the next day. 

My parents will likely be pretty understanding, but my family has never been very good at talking about important things.

<p>Basically, my clinic&#39;s nurse didn&#39;t put enough saline in, which caused me to take the entire amount of HCG instead of the 1 mL they told me to take. How bad would this be for me, and will it mess up my ovulation? I really don&#39;t want to call the office because I&#39;m not going to have them cancel my cycle that I&#39;ve spent so much time and money  on. Google isn&#39;t providing me with anything. Any ideas for me? </p>

29,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I've always been a writer. Initially I wrote this to share but then realized how much better I felt from writing it. It seems relevant for this group:

Unexplained infertility. Have two words ever had so much power over a woman in her thirties? 

Since I hate the word infertility, I prefer to say I have UI and before you decide to turn the page because you don’t have this problem, realize there’s at least one person you know who does. According to the Center for Human Reproduction, unexplained infertility affects up to 30% of women. If you have at least 4 friends trying to start families, one of them is experiencing this. 

Why don’t you know it’s happening to someone you know? No one really talks about it. Those of us who have received the UI diagnosis are left lurking on internet forums or secretly hoping one of our other thirty-something, childless friends is experiencing the same struggles so that we have an ally; or just someone to talk to.

Don’t ask me why it’s so hush-hush; it seems to be a topic that hasn’t caught up with time; this idea of a woman who can’t get pregnant is taboo. Happy, salt-and-pepper haired men on bicycles promote erectile dysfunction drugs on television yet public discussion on UI in mainstream media is hard to come by.

It can’t be ignored anymore. We really need to be embraced instead of left struggling alone in the shadows. Yes, we struggle…a lot. We are pin cushions and every birth announcement, gender reveal and baby’s first-whatever photos we see on social media are pins. Little pricks in our side reminding us that we may never have those photos of our own.

We know that you are just celebrating your own major accomplishment and that you’re happy. We want to be happy for you, we truly do. And, in the early stages of our diagnosis, we try to force ourselves to not be jealous and to think of reasons why we’re really happy for you. The problem is, we know you too well and we feel like we’re being punished somehow. 

Self-loathing is just one emotion we feel from our UI diagnosis. The emotional range that comes with the diagnosis is quite impressive. If you ever decide to explore the dark corners of your mind, know that we’ve already lived there thanks to a lethal cocktail of hormones and overthinking. Unfortunately we can’t embrace our all-consuming diagnosis because we don’t know how. It is unlike any other medical ailment you experience in that without a cause, the outcome is entirely out of anyone’s control.

It starts out innocently enough; we decide to start trying to have kids. I, myself, never wanted a family until I got married. We decided a few months post-wedding we would start trying. This seemed like the easiest thing in the world; I had countless friends who got pregnant on their honeymoon or within a few months of being married. 

After about six months and stark white pregnancy test strips of all varieties, I decided to see my gynecologist for some preliminary discussions. Two specifically-timed blood tests later, I was told everything was “normal” and that we should test my husband’s semen before doing an invasive test on me.

I wanted the invasive test now. I wanted to be 100% certain there was nothing blocking me up. I’ve read about blocked tubes, endometriosis, scar tissue, etc – you name it, I imagined it and I almost hoped I had one of them. In my opinion, the devil you know is always better.

After a number of phone calls to my gynecologist, it was evident they refused to do the invasive test, an HSG test, without my husband first being tested. The horror. I really wanted to protect him because quite frankly I believed it was all me. I just believed I would put him through the emasculating task of sitting in a sterile room with some magazines to give a sample for no reason. We decided that instead we would keep trying for a few more months if 10 months passed and we still didn’t have any success, we would do the tests.

Of course ten months passed but we didn’t do the tests. I decided instead to go to a specialist; I felt more confident going through testing with someone whose entire medical focus is the lack of pregnancy. Seeing a gynecologist was quite painful anyway; the waiting rooms are filled with pregnant women. 

It took me two months to get an appointment with a man who is said to be the best reproductive endocrinologist in my state. If we were going to do this, we were going to see the best doctor.

After giving the new doctor a detailed history and my records from the gynecologist, he decided to do more blood work and schedule the HSG test. The blood work had the same results, “normal,” and my HSG test showed that my lady parts were “wide open.” I had no blockages. My husband did his duty and his swimmers could challenge Michael Phelps.

This meant we were part of that 30% of UI couples. It’s all downhill from there. Since that diagnosis, I’ve had enough blood taken that my right arm is no longer an option for blood work. I’ve used progesterone, a hormone that makes you sleep and contemplate suicide. I’ve done two cycles of Clomid; aka steroids for your ovaries (also increased risk of multiples). I’ve had two HCG shots and two IUIs. I’ve been to the doctor at least 16 times in three months and have already spent thousands of dollars.

Funny thing is, that’s nothing compared to many women with UI. These women have braved each morning for years. That’s right years. I’ve read about women who’ve tried to get pregnant for 6 or 8 years due to UI. This means, there is nothing medically preventing pregnancy, it’s just not happening for them.

Aside from the needles, spread eagle position, ultrasounds, catheters and waiting rooms; the real horror comes from your mental state. While I’ve never been an optimist, I’m no downer. But I can’t remember the last time I’ve felt this much self-doubt, stress, anxiety, insecurity and stints of false hope. Could I not get pregnant because I was too thin? Is it because I spent many years saying I didn’t want kids (the law of attraction)? Am I too old? Forget the physical effects hormones have, I won’t go into those. 

The false hope of at-home ways to boost fertility and the borderline-scams that exist. I have purchased tea for fertility, fertility vitamins, some sort of incense/spell for fertility, and a number of other “proven” things like: royal jelly, maca, B12, D3, selenium, baby aspirin, etc, etc. I’ve stopped drinking alcohol for the three weeks I don’t have my period every single month. And, you better believe the moment the witch (or AF, as she’s known in UI forums) arrives, I am at a liquor store with mascara soaked cheeks in record timing.

I can tell you all of the acronyms used on UI forums from CM (cervical mucus) to DPO (days post ovulation). Did I mention I wake up at the same time every day to take my temperature? Yeah BBT (basal body temperature) and charting are supposedly great ways to track ovulation. I’ve peed on every brand of pregnancy test out there. I’ve never seen a second pink line, a blue plus sign or digital screen that tells me how many weeks pregnant I am. I’ve spent so much money on pregnancy tests, I’ve resigned to ordering cheapies on the internet. 

And, I’m not alone. So why do I have to feel that way? Why do I have to lurk on forums? Why isn’t this topic discussed more? Why isn’t it accepted?

I don’t know. But I am sick of feeling shame and sick of hiding. What I ask of everyone reading this – from the women who can’t get pregnant to the women who want to share their pregnancy with the world – help this topic get out there. 

If you are a woman who can’t get pregnant, know that you aren’t alone in how you feel. When you’re ready to talk, talk to someone – talk to me if you want. If you’re a woman who has no fertility issues, talk to your friends or family about this article. Maybe they’ll talk to someone else about it who knows someone who can’t get pregnant. Maybe, just maybe, a discussion will start and maybe it will spread far enough to bring those with UI out of the shadows into a place where they feel accepted.

<p>I can tell you all of the acronyms used on UI forums from CM (cervical mucus) to DPO (days post ovulation). Did I mention I wake up at the same time every day to take my temperature? Yeah BBT (basal body temperature) and charting are supposedly great ways to track ovulation. I’ve peed on every brand of pregnancy test out there. I’ve never seen a second pink line, a blue plus sign or digital screen that tells me how many weeks pregnant I am. I’ve spent so much money on pregnancy tests, I’ve resigned to ordering cheapies on the internet. </p>

<p>And, I’m not alone. So why do I have to feel that way? Why do I have to lurk on forums? Why isn’t this topic discussed more? Why isn’t it accepted?</p>

<p>I don’t know. But I am sick of feeling shame and sick of hiding. What I ask of everyone reading this – from the women who can’t get pregnant to the women who want to share their pregnancy with the world – help this topic get out there. </p>

<p>If you are a woman who can’t get pregnant, know that you aren’t alone in how you feel. When you’re ready to talk, talk to someone – talk to me if you want. If you’re a woman who has no fertility issues, talk to your friends or family about this article. Maybe they’ll talk to someone else about it who knows someone who can’t get pregnant. Maybe, just maybe, a discussion will start and maybe it will spread far enough to bring those with UI out of the shadows into a place where they feel accepted. </p>

All of my hormones are normal, AMH was great. I did a natural monitored cycle since insurance covered it, and everything developed well. My hormones matched OPK's perfectly, and those match my post OV rise in BBT. 

My husband had his initial SA, 86M total, 22M motile, 1mL volume. The doctor at shady grove said, don't panic, his percentage motility wasn't great but the number was pretty good. They wanted us to do a repeat SA a couple of weeks later (he said it could have been the very strenuous race we did the weekend before the SA, a fluke, nervousness whatever) and include a diagnostic wash. He was very specific about making sure we asked for a ""diagnostic wash"" (I didn't think to ask if this is different type of wash compared to IUI or if it was just for insurance coding). 


The second SA came back with 110M total with something like 47M motile and 0.5 mL volume. It was still under 50% but the total was good. When I asked about the volume, they said ""could be nerves, we aren't worried.""  The post wash numbers were 4M. At the time, my husband who fielded this call, said he was reassured that everything was fine and there's nothing to worry about. 


Our treatment plan from the doctor after the monitored cycle was to try on our own for a couple of months, come see him in January or February to talk about IUI. 


But everywhere says a post wash 4M total is abysmal and you should skip straight to IVF. Repeatedly when we have met with the doctor, he has said we have nothing to worry about, that we likely will never need his services, and we are fine. But what I've been reading on IUI contradicts all of these reassurances. I haven't yet scheduled the February appointment because I wanted to try again naturally this month. I will definitely be asking what the discrepancy is, but I have heard nothing but great things about shady grove, their success rate is very high, and he seems so confident that we won't need to go up to IVF.

Regarding the name: I gave up coffee before we started trying, but I still miss it. Decaf is one of those stupid things. A daily reminder that I'm stuck in limbo.

I've been lurking for over a year. Now that IVF is the next step for me, I guess it's finally time to admit I belong here. 

I'm turning 32 soon. Never pregnant. Used the symptothermal method to avoid for a number of years (thanks universe for making me take my temperature for nothing). I've had 7 failed IUIs over the course of the past year and a half, and will be starting IVF hopefully next month. I switched insurance and RE's recently and have coverage for treatment for the first time.

My situation is a little different than the norm in that I'm exclusively using donor sperm as a ""choice"": my husband has an inherited medical issue (everyone else in that part of the family tree has died from similar problems, many as children) that we want to avoid passing on. After years of genetic testing and still finding no known gene mutation responsible, we shelved the idea that we could have my husband's biological children. PGD or prenatal screening aren't going to help us avoid it, so we aren't willing to roll the dice.

It can feel very isolating. I feel like I am constantly being asked to justify that I need treatment. And finally now that I've been through enough to qualify as ""unexplained"" despite numbers and tests looking fine, I still face the incredulous tone from people who don't understand that I would do this on purpose.  The insurance person who preauthorized my benefits just the other day: ""If you've never tried naturally, how do you know you're infertile?"" And once again I recount my history and hope it's enough.

At the NYE party the wife of my BF's friend announced they were starting IVF this year. 
Apparently they just finished all the tests and they are now going to start the medical procedures. 

She then went on explaining quite in detail their infertility issues (MFI) with the husband being in another room. I felt not at ease with this. I mean there were close but also not close friends in the room and I felt for him about her sharing such sensitive details.

I congratulated her about it, wishing them all the best while inside I felt like dying. And it was because they didn't know we are starting the preliminary tests this January and that I am on the hard journey to meet the physical requirements to access IVF. 
I was taken back by the way she was describing getting pregnant through IVF as ""only having a test tube baby"". Maybe she was trying to make the tone of the conversation lighter, but those words were like heart stabbings for me.

It would have been good to have a friend going through my same experience, to share and help through this process, but her stance made me realise she would use this experience as another excuse to increase the rivalry she feels against me.

<p>I congratulated her about it, wishing them all the best while inside I felt like dying. And it was because they didn&#39;t know we are starting the preliminary tests this January and that I am on the hard journey to meet the physical requirements to access IVF.

We are prepping for our third round of IVF.  I'm 38, hypothyroid, insulin-resistant, and recently diagnosed with extremely mild endometriosis.  I have been put on microgynon birth control pills for two months in preparation for IVF in the spring.

In our quest to get pregnant, I lost have 100 lb over the course of 2 years.  I recently lost the final 30 lb using a ketogenic diet, which  I am still obeying, but by eating more veg and more calories so that I maintain a steady weight.

The final bit of weight loss was very rapid and in addition to watching my carbohydrate intake, I also watched calories.

I've been on microgynon before, but this time, things are *radically* different.  I've been on it for about 10 days, and I have gone from an otherwise normal, intelligent, calm, sane person, to a complete raving lunatic and basket case.  

I'm incredibly anxious, shaky, dizzy, nervous.  The smallest thing (breaking a plate while doing dishes) causes me to fly into a full-blown panic attack.

I am wondering if, as a result of my rapid weight loss, I might be deficient in some vitamins or nutrients (B vitamins, Omega-3 or something) that could be causing this madness.  I know my thyroid needs to be adjusted, that will be addressed this week.

I had so many dreams, only to have them go up in smoke a few months later when we started to notice problems. 

We've been to an RE, the best one in our state. He's pricey, but well worth it because he is very proactive. He's just completed the testing phase. We're dealing with MFI (low count), PCOS, anemia, MTHFR deficiency homozygous, obesity, high AMH, and i had a uterine polyp (0.75cm) that my RE removed in November. He said our best option was losing weight, so we both joined keto and so far, ive lost 23 pounds and 14.25"" and hubbs has lost 19"". My RE said that if we want to conceive, immediately following polyp removal is the best time, because polyps grow due to excess estrogen, which can be caused by obesity, so the polyp can grow back. If it does, ill have to have another surgery before we can start treatment.

We are both working, full time steady jobs. After bills, expenses, and everything, we have $15k a year left over. I have $5k in debt with a low credit score. This month Im supposed to go back to my RE to start treatment, but me and hubby have discussed it and we arent sure its the right thing to do right now.

I want to get my debt paid, get my credit score up, and lose some more weight. Hubby wants that too, but he also wants to have a sizable amount in the bank before starting fertility treatments. Which i understand and agree with. And I am only 26, so we have time on our side.

However, if we do this, it puts us at trying to conceive again in 2017 at the earliest. This makes me feel like ive failed, like im giving up on my child. But im also rational enough to know that no matter how much we invest in this process, a child may never be in the cards for us. I can lose all the weight, get a big bank account, get a super high credit score, and still never get pregnant. So, i dont see the point of putting our life on hold to try for this child who may very well never be meant to exist. We may be meant for foster care, or adopting a child. Or we may be meant to live childless. 

So my rational side says to wait on children until we're stable and able to fully provide a good life for any children we may be able to make. But my maternal side says im getting closer and closer to that cutoff age, and waiting may be the kiss of death for us ever having children.

Im so confused. I want babies. I want them so bad it hurts. But looking at the facts, my body is fighting this tooth and nail and i cant help but feel like itll take severe intervention to get pregnant, if i ever do. Add my husband's issues, and it all feels so hopeless. But then again, i cant go through my life without children. My life will never feel complete without children. I feel like a failure, no matter how much my husband and family says that my husband shares the blame, i know its on me. He has sperm, even if they're lacking numbers, they're motile and normal. Its not him, its me. Im the one who cant give him a family, and it kills me inside to know that. I dont know what to do.

Literally three days after i had sex for the first time, we threw out the condoms. I had so many dreams, only to have them go up in smoke a few months later when we started to notice problems. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been to an RE, the best one in our state. He&#39;s pricey, but well worth it because he is very proactive. He&#39;s just completed the testing phase. We&#39;re dealing with MFI (low count), PCOS, anemia, MTHFR deficiency homozygous, obesity, high AMH, and i had a uterine polyp (0.75cm) that my RE removed in November. He said our best option was losing weight, so we both joined keto and so far, ive lost 23 pounds and 14.25&quot; and hubbs has lost 19&quot;. My RE said that if we want to conceive, immediately following polyp removal is the best time, because polyps grow due to excess estrogen, which can be caused by obesity, so the polyp can grow back. If it does, ill have to have another surgery before we can start treatment.</p>

<p>We are both working, full time steady jobs. After bills, expenses, and everything, we have $15k a year left over. I have $5k in debt with a low credit score. This month Im supposed to go back to my RE to start treatment, but me and hubby have discussed it and we arent sure its the right thing to do right now.</p>

<p>I want to get my debt paid, get my credit score up, and lose some more weight. Hubby wants that too, but he also wants to have a sizable amount in the bank before starting fertility treatments. Which i understand and agree with. And I am only 26, so we have time on our side.</p>

<p>However, if we do this, it puts us at trying to conceive again in 2017 at the earliest. This makes me feel like ive failed, like im giving up on my child. But im also rational enough to know that no matter how much we invest in this process, a child may never be in the cards for us. I can lose all the weight, get a big bank account, get a super high credit score, and still never get pregnant. So, i dont see the point of putting our life on hold to try for this child who may very well never be meant to exist. We may be meant for foster care, or adopting a child. Or we may be meant to live childless. </p>

<p>So my rational side says to wait on children until we&#39;re stable and able to fully provide a good life for any children we may be able to make. But my maternal side says im getting closer and closer to that cutoff age, and waiting may be the kiss of death for us ever having children.</p>

<p>Im so confused. I want babies. I want them so bad it hurts. But looking at the facts, my body is fighting this tooth and nail and i cant help but feel like itll take severe intervention to get pregnant, if i ever do. Add my husband&#39;s issues, and it all feels so hopeless. But then again, i cant go through my life without children. My life will never feel complete without children. I feel like a failure, no matter how much my husband and family says that my husband shares the blame, i know its on me. He has sperm, even if they&#39;re lacking numbers, they&#39;re motile and normal. Its not him, its me. Im the one who cant give him a family, and it kills me inside to know that. I dont know what to do.</p>

<p>TLDR: Im still young, we have debt and would like to get it paid off and save cash and lose weight, but im struggling with it because it means putting off kids for a year or so.</p>

------------

/u/FelixxFelicis: Waiting for IVF 3 in February

/u/nikipie: Getting our ducks in a row to prep for IVF #1

/u/Whisgo: Hsg scheduled jan 15th yay? :/

/u/elcagey2: Still waiting for our IVF cycle orientation where we will find out waiting list information for provincial funding

/u/bedjbaby: First appt with a new RE on the 7th

/u/mbm8377: Have to repeat hubby's SA in two weeks. Volume was too low & they couldn't do morphology. Other numbers also did not look good so he has to have some more bloodwork done as well.
As for myself, they want me to loose more wright so...meh. Working on that i suppose.

/u/mirandakate: WTF appt with RE to discuss FET #5 failure and also including prednisone & clexane into FET #6 protocol 19 Jan

/u/audpgh: Waiting on the call that embryos have been donated for us.

/u/jdyubergeek: IVF #2 cycle starts the last Saturday of January.

/u/Nerds_Wear_Glasses: Waiting for my period to start sometime around January 20th (give or take a few days) so I can start suppression for my first (and hopefully last) IVF cycle.

/u/Kronur: Had day 3 blood work, day 21 progesterone, HSG, husband's sperm analysis, and initial RE appt. Follow-up appt. on 1/14 to discuss results of everything + treatment options.

/u/centernova: Waiting to start Femara for what will hopefully be IUI #2.

/u/camelpose: Waiting for my appointment in March with a ridiculously popular reproductive immunologist that books out months in advance. So benched for the near future.

/u/allbustnoballs: I finally saw an RE last week (not just my regular OB--wish I wouldn't have waited so long to do this)! I'm having my first HSG this week, then doing another month of femara and IUI.

/u/LadyLatitude: Taking January off. Waiting to schedule a consult with a new RE (old one wasn't good) and figure out our options from there. 

/u/GIMME_ALL_THE_BABIES: Looks like barring any bizarre diagnostic results, I will be starting my first IVF late this month.

/u/treacheroushuevos:  Starting BC this month for IVF #2 in February.

/u/NeedANap1116: Waiting on another laparoscopy on January 12, then (hopefully?) getting a start date for IVF #1.

/u/kimmy9: 1st Egg retrieval early Dec, severe OHSS, unable to do fresh cycle. Hoping for 1st FET in late February early March!

/u/sarah_harvey: First visit to RE. Hsg complete and clear. Month 5 on Femara. Added monitoring and ovidrel this time. 4 20mm+ on left and 1 12mm on right with good lining. However, without baseline ultrasound on cd1-3, all, some or none of them could be empty. :

/u/oh-no-varies: Starting 10 weeks of birth control to give my body time to shrink my cysts, avoid producing any new ones and then will start new protocol of letrozole with trigger shot and TI in March/April (if all goes well)

/u/alphalimahotel: Waiting to get through our protocol to our FET on March 2!

/u/totesemoshamazeballs: In clinic in the morning for my pretreatment appointment for icsi. Will be shown how to use medication...dont really know what else to expect but I'm so excited! It's finally happening :)

/u/attemptingtobe: DOR lady here - just had my post ovulation baseline to start estrogen priming. We have 11 resting follicles! A new record (had 3 last may). 10 days of estrogen and then starting stims.

Added monitoring and ovidrel this time. 4 20mm+ on left and 1 12mm on right with good lining. However, without baseline ultrasound on cd1-3, all, some or none of them could be empty. :</p>

<p><a href=""/u/oh-no-varies"">/u/oh-no-varies</a>: Starting 10 weeks of birth control to give my body time to shrink my cysts, avoid producing any new ones and then will start new protocol of letrozole with trigger shot and TI in March/April (if all goes well)</p>

I was prepared for it to be uncomfortable and less than pleasant but I imagined that, at worst, it would be slightly more painful than a pap smear, but manageable.

The nurse actually started a timer at the beginning of the procedure.  The whole thing took 17.4 seconds, and it was quite possibly the most excruciating 17 seconds of my life.

I left shaking and traumatized, bleeding, nauseous, and in so much freaking pain that it brings tears to my eyes just to think about it today, and I'm not an easy crier - I haven't cried in probably a year.

I had a large ovarian cyst rupture last year that landed me in urgent care.

In my opinion, it is totally mindblowing that they would do this procedure without anesthetic. FWIW, my tubes were open and everything looked normal, with the exception of some scar tissue.

114,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"...or at least decide how badly we want that shit (baby) and try real hard to have it.

Now, I know what your thinking, but Lady, we're all trying really hard here. I have no doubt many of you are trying really hard. But I'm not, or at least I've had a moment of enlightenment/acceptance that makes me think I need to try harder. And by try harder, I mean bite the bullet and do the IVF. 

Let's review the facts: 

* I'm going to be 33 in February.

* When I had my CD3 tests done, I was 31. They weren't good then, and we know they don't get better.

* HSG clear

* AMH 0.998

* FSH 9.6

* Estradiol 71 (not sure if that's high enough to assume FSH suppression

* TSH 3.6 (on meds for this, test 2 months ago was 0.5)

* After 3 months of RE ""watching"" a cyst, I had a lap, removed an endometrioma that had engulfed my entire right ovary, removed endo from 6 places AND adhesions. More good news. Joy. 

* Husband has Olympic sperm. Seriously, almost 200 million, 120 million motile, and 20% morphology.


Now, lets have real talk. Am I wasting my time with IUIs?. I wasn't given a stage diagnosis for the endo, but it's got to be at least III, likely IV. We all know what that means. I can't remember what success rate our RE gave us for medicated IUI, but if y'all [remember](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3v7fbp/do_i_need_to_see_another_re_how_many_did_you_see/) he doesn't inspire confidence.

More real talk:

* I've read women on here 10 years older than me with higher AMH. This makes me bitter, WTF?! (sorry girls, I get the bitters, forgive me)

* From what I've read, depending how long I've had that endometrioma, this could be mostly to blame for my premature ovarian aging. 

* I'm running out of time. It sucks, but I am.

* I respond very well to the smallest dose of Clomid. I always make 2 plump follicles and 2 dumpy ones. This makes me think I'd be a good responder to stims. Right? That's good logic, right?


Our first IUI (which failed on Christmas Day, yay for us) I had 2 follicles and fifty-fucking-four million sperm. Nothing, not even a chemical. Y'all, the stars could not have been more aligned. If I can't get pregnant in that situation, y'all think it's time to move on?

I'm having to sit January out with no treatment while I switch RE's and wait for a new consult. We'll just have to weigh our odds. I mean, a 25% chance with IUI is good. I'd do that. But a 15% chance with IUI or a 50% chance with IVF (I'm just making up numbers here) then, I'd do the IVF. Right?

A few months ago, I sought out some advice/encouragement from IF babies. I ruffled some feathers over there, and a few of them ruffled mine. But, I did my best to apologize and take what was said to me to heart. The babies all come out the same. I complained about the probes and one lady said she was thankful for them, for the technology. Would you regret not choosing ART if you could? 

At the time, I think I wasn't ready to give up the dream of conceiving naturally. While I don't think I'm ready to give that up now, (I mean who is, but what choice do we have) I am ready to have a baby. I can get *really* caught up in how things are *supposed to be.* I need to stop letting this control my life and future.

Last night my husband confessed he'd like me to try the IVF if the IUIs don't work. He said he felt so guilty asking me to do it because he know's it'll be so hard on my physically. He said he knows it's not fair because I, as a woman, already bear the brunt of pregnancy, childbirth, a body forever changed (but so worth it!), and breast feeding. :( Tears y'all! How did *I* end up with such an amazing man?! The next generation needs more of his sweetness. We have to try harder. We have the money, we have everything we need, but I'm reluctant:

* I'm scared to keep trying. A part of me just wants to stop trying now. I can't function the way I could before. I don't know how many more months I can take. Call me weaksauce, but this hurt is debilitating my life.

* I'm scared we'll end up with more embryos than children we want. I'm not okay giving them away and I'm not okay throwing them away. Please don't judge me, but I wonder how God will guide our choices. We all handle these things as best we can.

* I'm scared to put all of our eggs in this basket and for it to fail. IVF is a last resort (we both agree we don't want to pursue donor gametes)

* I'm scared we'd have to do it many times. We could afford it, but I don't want to spend my ""youth"" in treatment. If we do IVF, where is the line? 

* I'm scared this could negatively impact our marriage. I have a communication/social disorder, so sometimes it's already tough.

So, as you can see, I'm scared.

I don't know what my point to all of this is. Perhaps I just needed to get it out there. What would you guys do? Thank you so much for reading. Big prayers and hugs for everyone this New Year.

For background, I have PCOS with a high AMH for being 35 years old and my husband has severely low count that requires ICSI. IVF #1 was a pretty standard protocol for someone with my labs: BCPs and Lupron, then Gonal 150 and Menopur 75 with an Ovidrel trigger.  I had a huge amount of measurable follicles, 31, but retrieval only yielded 10 eggs, 8 of which were mature. My E2 was pretty much immediately high and I only stimmed for 8 days.  All 8 eggs fertilized with ICSI but failed to impress anyone with their development. We did a D3 transfer that ultimately failed, and ended up on D6 with a poor blastocyst and a morula, both of which were of too poor quality to freeze.

My RE said that for IVF #2 that she would just power through on the stims, push me to OHSS, and freeze on D2. We'd then unfreeze for a FET, let them develop, and then transfer. Any remaining blasts would be frozen.

Firstly, how can knowingly pushing a patient into OHSS line up with ""do no harm""?  She seems to think that OHSS isn't a big deal.  Secondly, the freeze-unfreeze-freeze thing just feels like a way to ultimately charge me twice for freezing. That feels predatory to me.  Also, since we had poor embryo development last time, there's a risk that nothing will develop and we will have lost 4 months (waiting for the FET then waiting to stim again).  That is stressing me out. 

My insurance company has an independent IVF nurse resource that I can use, and she and I both agree that since I'm a high responder that a low-and-slow stim is far more appropriate and better for me physically, to reduce the chances of OHSS.  We would start at Gonal 150 and Menopure 75, and once my E2 started to spike drop down to Gonal 112.5 or 75 to hopefully allow more follicles to develop mature eggs over a 10-12 day stim vs. 8 days previously.

*So how to I convince my RE to do low-and-slow vs. powering through to OHSS? Can I force them to let the embryos develop to D5, then freeze any blasts right away, fully knowing that none may develop? In that sense, who owns and controls the embryos: me, the lab, or the RE?*  Switching REs now is not possible because I'm starting my Lupron for IVF #2 on Thursday.

I have taken a small break from r/infertility since we finished IVF in Oct, just wanting to try and forget about our infertility for a while until we decide when to do our FET. 

After Christmas has been so horrible the last two years (cancer diagnosis, surgery, then another tumor a year later, major surgery), I was really hoping this year would be the best ever. We went home to see our families, which was already a mistake because we were already both been dealing with cancer-related post traumatic stress this month. We went to my husband's big family gathering where right off the bat his (unmarried/younger) cousin announced her pregnancy. Some sad feelings came up but I really tried to keep them at bay, even saying to my husband ""well at least it wasn't your sister!"" Soon after, my husbands 96 year old grandpa asked him if we had kids, to which my husband replied no. Grandpa replied ""you still have time,"" which made my husband sad and emotional. It hurt so much to see him like that... 

I thought the hard parts were over and then at the smaller family gathering my sweet (younger) sister-in-law announced her pregnancy by gifting my MIL a framed ultrasound picture. It has been my dream to announce our pregnancy over Christmas, especially because I want to replace some horrific memories with beautiful ones for us... I feel so crushed. This should have been us too. We planned on trying naturally last fall before we knew my husband needed surgery last year (the surgery left him with retrograde ejaculation aka NO chance of conceiving naturally... i guess it doesn't make much of a difference since I don't fucking ovulate anyways), and instead we ended up doing IVF (with no transfer yet). 

I can't help but envy all of the people around me. They don't have a life of cancer hanging over them, they don't have to deal with infertility, and they have so many special moments like this as a result. I just feel like this has ripped out my heart (and made me a horrible person because I should only be happy that I get to be an aunt and that two people I love very much are going to be parents). We were hoping to be able to announce our pregnancy next Christmas, but now that just feels stupid. Feeling really sorry for myself right now. BTW- I have been saying for months that this would happen. At Thanksgiving I turned to my husband and said ""I think she is pregnant,"" which may have been before she even knew (she is 8 weeks now). I just knew it in my soul.

For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.

Negative results are also welcome here, though they need not be confined to this thread. Members with questionable results who want immediate support, and those who need their follow-up questions to be open to greater and faster readership are, as always, welcome to post freely on the main board.

I have 2-3 doses left, so if using the overage means not opening my second pen, that would be spectacular. Thanks!</p>

I'm a male (28) and my wife is 25. We decided to start a family and after 1.5 years of no luck we decided to go to the doc. My wife checked out completely normal. After my first semen analysis, which was a complete disaster for me mentally, it came back as azoospermic (sp?) or basically a zero reading of swimmers. They sent me to a specialist (male infertility specialist) and beforehand they tested my hormone levels. 

At the specialist  appointment, I was told that I was completely normal as far as hormones. Then the doc examined me. Things got weird. 

After 7-8 minutes of fondling and a bunch of numbers he was telling his assistant I was getting worried. He stops, says, ""okay everything just changed. As far as I can tell, you don't have a vas deferens. On either side. So IVF is our only option and that will be $15k while the sperm retrieval from you will be $2k.""

This hit me like a ton of bricks and I could mutter was ""well...fuck"". 

They diagnosed CBVDA which is basically like I was born with a vasectomy. No way for the sperm to come out of me. And apparently extremely rare. 

 I come from a religious culture where family is extremely important. Everyone has been very supportive but I can't help but feel... Inadequate.

This is not a common test yet, but it check for chromosomal anomalies across a small set of chromosomes that would be likely to cause problems.

I work in a NICU as a ward clerk and two days ago, I got a call from L&amp;D that a woman had given birth and didn't want the baby. Everyone was kind of surprised, because normally we know when there are adoptive babies being born. Since there is no newborn nursery here and babies just room in with the parents, adoptive babies hang out with us in the NICU. But we had no idea this one was coming. 

The mother apparently found out she was pregnant at 33 weeks when getting an MRI. She and her husband are separated, divorcing, already have two kids, and neither of them wanted this baby. She didn't make any attempts to contact an adoption agency and just assumed that ""the government"" would take the baby. 

She refused to look at, hold, or name the baby girl. She demanded to be discharged as soon as possible after giving birth so she ""wouldn't miss Christmas with her children."" 

Now it is well within her rights to give up her little girl if she doesn't want her. Better for the baby too, rather than be raised in an unloving, broken home. It's totally understandable.

But it just broke my heart to see the social worker take her away to go to foster care today. The woman who gave birth to her is at home celebrating with her family. From what the nurses who cared for her said about her attitude, she probably isn't giving a second thought to the baby she carried and gave birth to. But she might be, she might be suffering. Who knows. 

I went to the store last night and bought a Christmas patterned baby blanket and onesie with snowflakes and penguins for her - I couldn't bear to see her taken out of here in a regular hospital blanket and no clothes of her own on Christmas. 

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, just that it's a hard situation to witness and makes me so sad right now. 

UPDATE: We learned that the family our little baby is going to today is a long term foster family, so they likely are the ones who will end up adopting her!

<p>I went to the store last night and bought a Christmas patterned baby blanket and onesie with snowflakes and penguins for her - I couldn&#39;t bear to see her taken out of here in a regular hospital blanket and no clothes of her own on Christmas. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what the point of this post is, just that it&#39;s a hard situation to witness and makes me so sad right now. </p>

<p>UPDATE: We learned that the family our little baby is going to today is a long term foster family, so they likely are the ones who will end up adopting her! She was so adorable in her little red Christmas fleece so I&#39;m imagining a family welcoming her with open arms as their little Christmas gift! </p>

When we're faced with infertility treatments, it often means that should our treatment work, we end up with multiples. Twins, triplets, etc. If you've talked with an RE, you know that this is not what they want to achieve - they want healthy singletons. Twins are a bit more risky than multiples, with lower birth weights, earlier delivery dates, and higher risk for cerebral palsy and a bunch of other things. But it's not that much riskier. Triplets and more, however, is. The average triplet is born at 33 weeks and weighs 4 pounds. 

It's really, really tempting to think you're getting two for the price of one. All this treatment is expensive. But you want to know what's really expensive? Raising healthy twins. And sick twins, or triplets, is even moreso. I know how much it hurts to cancel a cycle, especially after you've spent so much money on procedures and medication, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of caring for multiples once they arrive.

Multiples are a major risk for IUI when you've got 3 or more follicles. Kate Gosselin had her sextuplets on an IUI cycle with only 4 follicles - and she actually had seven but one fetus failed to develop. They can't always see all the follicles on scans, after all. 

They're also a risk for IVF. We all know of Octomom, who transferred 12 embryos (assuming blasts) and got eight babies. Six implanted, and two of those split to form identicals. This is why so many REs push for Single Embryo Transfer. We can't stop the identicals from splitting, but we can avoid 3 or more by doing one at a time, even if it takes more cycles.

And when you show up at the 8 week scan and there are three, or four, heartbeats? What then? If you try to carry all of them, you might lose all of them. You can opt for selective reduction, which is a fancy name for aborting some, but not all, of the fetuses. For some people, this is ok. For others, it's not. I just really want all of you to think about it, and to make your choice about what you'll do now, before you're stuck with an ultrasound probe against your abdomen with emotions running high. 

If you decide now, with your partner, that you're absolutely not ok with selective reduction, then you can guide your own treatment to reduce the risk of multiples. Cancel IUI cycles with 4 or more follicles, or convert them to IVF if you've got a bunch. Stick to single embryo transfers, or at most two. If you decide that you're ok with selective reduction, you could be a bit more risky in your treatment options. 

Whatever you choose for yourself is the right choice. I don't want this to become an abortion debate, I just want you to think about this and make your choice now, with a clear head and heart, so that you're not blindsided should this happen.

- Looking at the top figure here: http://imgur.com/a/FEAqY , the orangey line shows success rates for each cycle in women <40.

I (M34) have a child from a previous relationship.  We/I think it would be great to have another child with my wife (F34).  We have been trying for the last 2 years. We have done IUI, medicated cycles and have been recommended to look into IVF.  It's expensive. We will have to fly to the clinic and even then the cost will be between $25,000 to $32,000(without airfare/lodging.etc.), depending on which plan we decide to select.    

I understand that she wants a child and I don't blame her for it, but how could I ever say no?  She may initially move past it, but what happens when we are older and she starts to resent me for not trying? Or maybe saying no now will drive us apart.

It's tough (I know all the cycles and medical is tough on her too and I'm not making light of it) on me because I'm the only one working.  We are paying her student loans, I'm not contributing to my retirement so that we can get her loans paid off, we are living with her parents and we had planned to pay off her loans and then save up to buy a new house.  

I understand that a lot of people couldn't even consider the costs of IVF and we are fortunate that we can, but we will still have to pay the money back - with or with out a child.

I think that maybe I'm just upset because I really have no choice in the matter.  I have to agree to at least try or else she could build a grudge now or in the future.

We don’t have the emotional strength or financial resources to continue trying for something that may never happen. And I need to focus on my physical and mental health, both of which have suffered greatly these past 5 years of trying to conceive.


The decision was both sudden and long-expected. A year ago, my husband and I decided that we would try a third and final IVF before stopping treatment and moving on with our lives. Our first two IVFs were unsuccessful and yielded poor quality embryos. A last attempt would be our insurance against regrets and a reasonable stopping point. The plan made sense to us. 


But that third attempt never happened. On top of my history of PCOS and endometrial hyperplasia, there were thyroid issues. Then a uterine polyp. We started to stim for an IVF attempt, only to have to cancel due to zero follicle growth. Then there was a troublesome cyst, resulting in a lap that also revealed endometriosis and scarring. More thyroid issues and especially concerning to my RE, an increased hbA1C and skyrocketing insulin levels despite being on Metformin. She strongly believes that high insulin levels affect egg quality. Given the history of our poor-quality embryos, she recommended we not proceed with another IVF at this time. When my husband and I considered all factors, including our ages of 39 and 44, we decided we didn’t want to wait. We wanted to stop. We could have insisted on trying a cycle now, or we could have waited until my numbers improved. We could get other opinions or switch clinics. But, we decided the universe has been telling us to stop and it was time.


I couldn’t live with the cycle of hope and devastation any longer. I know many people can balance infertility within the context of the rest of their life. I couldn’t. It consumed me. The chronic migraines, depression, and anxiety disorder that had been under control before we started trying have become debilitating. My career has imploded, my sense of confidence and self-worth shattered. I need to reclaim my life, focus on my health, and find a sense of purpose again. And I couldn’t do it while fighting my body with infertility treatment.


It’s been almost two months since we made the decision to stop. The first month was unbearable grief. I sobbed multiple times a day. I’m still devastated. I don’t how or when or if I’ll ever truly accept the reality of never having a baby. I think maybe I’m coping with a sort of numb denial at the moment, a state of shock. I have a list of therapists to contact for when I’m ready to face and talk about it.


And yet, I know I’ve made the right decision. The thought of restarting treatment is terrifying. I can’t do it again. I’ve started treating my health, taking the meds I need, without fear of what it might do to a potential fetus. Because of my history of hyperplasia, I will be on some form of progesterone or birth control for the rest of my life, making a surprise pregnancy literally impossible. It’s probably better for me psychologically to not have that thread of hope, however slight. And it lets me treat my health worry-free.


I don’t know what my life will look like in the future. But I know it will be better than the awful limbo of uncertainty of the past few years. I’m thankful for my husband and my parents and siblings who have been sources of absolute support. And while I’ve lost some friends through the years, I’ve made some wonderful new ones. I’ll have to figure out a new career path. I don’t want to return to the classroom. It would be too exhausting, too painful. But there are options out there. I’m trying to accept that life will simply be different from what I had imagined. Holidays and facebook and children everywhere out in the world will probably be painful for long a time. But I have to believe that there is happiness to be found.


The adoption question looms. I am on the fence. Some days I feel certain I want to experience motherhood by any means. Other days, I just don’t want to do it for a number of reasons.  There are a lot of feelings of guilt about it. My husband is open to the idea, though I think he’s enjoying the part-time nature of being uncle to our nephews. The emotions are too raw and too intense right now, and we decided we weren’t going to make any decisions about adoption one way or the other for at least 6 months, maybe a year.


I don’t know if I’ll live to regret this decision to stop treatment. I just know that the same way I knew I had to try, I now know that I have to stop.


I’ve already pulled back from this community greatly and though I miss it, I think to protect myself I’ll need to step away for a good long while, maybe permanently. But I am so very grateful for the love and support and advice and friendship that I’ve received here over the years. This is a truly special corner of the internet and I’m lucky to have been a part of it.


I wish you all happiness and peace of mind in whatever life may bring.

With love,
Dusty

But I also know that it is time. We don’t have the emotional strength or financial resources to continue trying for something that may never happen. And I need to focus on my physical and mental health, both of which have suffered greatly these past 5 years of trying to conceive.</p>

<p>The decision was both sudden and long-expected. A year ago, my husband and I decided that we would try a third and final IVF before stopping treatment and moving on with our lives. Our first two IVFs were unsuccessful and yielded poor quality embryos. A last attempt would be our insurance against regrets and a reasonable stopping point. The plan made sense to us. </p>

<p>But that third attempt never happened. On top of my history of PCOS and endometrial hyperplasia, there were thyroid issues. Then a uterine polyp. We started to stim for an IVF attempt, only to have to cancel due to zero follicle growth. Then there was a troublesome cyst, resulting in a lap that also revealed endometriosis and scarring. More thyroid issues and especially concerning to my RE, an increased hbA1C and skyrocketing insulin levels despite being on Metformin. She strongly believes that high insulin levels affect egg quality. Given the history of our poor-quality embryos, she recommended we not proceed with another IVF at this time. When my husband and I considered all factors, including our ages of 39 and 44, we decided we didn’t want to wait. We wanted to stop. We could have insisted on trying a cycle now, or we could have waited until my numbers improved. We could get other opinions or switch clinics.

I've gone through 5 early losses in the last three year and went through all the possible tests and what came out of this whole thing is: 

- My level of TSH was around 4.5 so they put me on Synthroid to lower it under 2.5. 

- My prolactine was higher than usual (around 30 when it's supposed to be less than 25 I think?) so they put me on Bromocriptine

- They found out that I have the mutation that doesn't absorb properly folic acid so I'm taking supplement to help out

That's it! I'm 30 yo, fairly healthy and yet, it seems like my body doesn't know how to stay pregnant. Beside my crazy psychologist who told me that my body just doesn't want to cary a child because I didn't get the chance to experience a normal childhood wasn't super helpful, so I would really appreciate to hear anyone who has gone through this roller coaster of miscarriages.

I do know my RE back then had no clue what she was doing and I am in way better hands this time, but I am not ready. I am scared that she is not going to let me continue on Femara for more cycles.</p>

We love this church very much and have been going since it started in our pastor's living room and have seen it grow to 2 services.  We serve on some ministries and are active in our community group (much like Bible study, we meet one night a week).

Yesterday,  our community group leaders, who happen to be good friends of ours as well, invited us over for lunch to talk about stuff.  I had a feeling that they didn't agree with our choices after our first talk with them when they kept asking if ""we had considered adoption"".    Well I felt steam rolled yesterday, they told us that we should pray to God to heal my husband's MFI and that we should ask the elders of the church to pray over us.  Do they not realize that we've been praying about this since last September????  They went on to talk about their concerns about the preservation of life and the questions that will arise when/if we have extra embryos.  Again, things that are also weighing on us heavily.  Mind you these friends are our age, and also had a baby 4 months ago.  Our church is full of young couples, I started crying in church again yesterday because 3 pregnant ladies walked by not to mention 2 very tiny newborns.  


None of this helps, not to mention we finally had our consultations with two separate clinics last week so we could make a decision on where we want to go.  I believe in God, I'm not angry at Him for our situation.  But I also don't believe that he's some magical genie that is going to solve our problem.  I don't want to go to church anymore and as much as I care about our community group leaders I don't want to be around them right now.  They also sent us [this](http://www.thevillagechurch.net/sermon/should-christians-use-contraceptive-methods-and-reproductive-technologies/) article explaining their position.  I'm just kind of floored about everything.  As if this isn't hard enough...

I don't know why I posted here but I guess I just needed some support from people who understand.  I'm tired, I'm sad, I'm scared and dammit I just want to be supported.....
