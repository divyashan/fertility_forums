I've been temping and using OPKs since I stopped BCP, my cycles have been ovulatory and regular, and our timing has been fairly good (1-2 times between O-3 and O-1). The doctor agreed that it was a good idea to start some basic tests. Results of my day 21 labs are unknown, I'll go in for my day 3 labs next week, and she ordered an SA for my husband.

The nurse called and said the SA results were in and that the doctor wants me to come in for a ""results evaluation"" visit after my day 3 lab results are in. I asked her for the results, and she said the lab suggested he repeat the SA, but that the doctor says there is no need to do so. The nurse said the doctor must have another plan, since she wants me to come in and discuss the results. I asked again for the results, and it took several tries before I could get actual numbers from her. Here they are, pretty much verbatim using the terms she used:

* Motility is good at 50% (normal is 40%) 
* Amount is 134 million (normal is 39 million)
* Morphology is 0.5% (normal is either 4% or 14% - I can't remember, because at this point my brain became super foggy after hearing that low morphology number)

I work in healthcare, and it was pretty frustrating that she didn't just read out the results to me. I had to specifically ask for the morphology results because she stopped at ""amount,"" and even then she wouldn't quantify them or give me a reference range until I asked. 

Anyway, I have to break the news to him tonight, and I will try to soften it so that he doesn't feel bad. He's a doctor, so there's only so much I can sugarcoat it. I emailed the nurse for the correct morphology reference range. I know 0.5% is terrible no matter what, but I'd feel better if they used the strict Kruger analysis and the normal was 4% instead of 14%. I also found [this reassuring info](https://www.asrm.org/FACTSHEET_Sperm_Shape_Morphology/) from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and I'll send it to him after I've given him the news. 

I really don't know what our options will be, and (fortunately) we're both patient enough to hear what the doctor has to say in a couple of weeks. I've searched this sub and come up with a list of questions for her, and I'm hoping that his other numbers somewhat compensate for the poor morphology.

** ETA: Sorry for the bad acronym! I fixed it in the body, but it's too late for the header.

Today I feel sad and angry.

Why why why why why is life so unfair.

I feel bitter. And sad. Hello depression.

Christmas just wasn’t the same, and I was hoping it would help. I was hoping for love and relaxation and fun.

Instead I got drama and grinches and petty crap. 

Why should anyone have such a meltdown fit over not getting Christmas morning when SHIT LIKE THIS happens. I don’t give a fuck about any of it. I had 2 babies DIE INSIDE OF ME. I don’t give a flying fuck about your problems. Fuck you.

And I don’t need snotty snide remarks about not being asked if you wanted a mimosa even though I plainly asked you 2 minutes before that. 

See? Stupid petty dramatic bullshit.

We spent $20,000 on IVF. 20 fucking thousand. Got eggs, didn’t get pregnant. Then paid another $6,000 and got twins, only to have them die inside of me. Lucky us - we get to spend another $6,000 to see if we get pregnant again. And then maybe again! And then we’re out of embryos. 

What happens if we reach that point? 

I’m going to Thailand and adopting 3 more dogs, that’s what.

And Hawaii. And Ireland. And Iceland. And to see the redwoods.

And then I bet we’d still try again. Sometimes I wonder if I even actually want a stupid baby anymore. Or am I just pissed off that I can’t get this to work? Is it competition with myself? No. Obviously I want a child. But all the fun has been ripped right from my heart. Now I feel like I’m fighting the battles for the sake of fighting the battles. Because I feel like a failure and I can’t handle that. I’ve never wanted or fought for something so hard in my life - I can’t fail now. Right? 

Whenever I get a baby, it better be REAL FUCKING CUTE. And sleep like a goddamn angel.

What if I finally get that baby and then I don’t love it? What if, after infertility and miscarriage, I end up having to deal with postpartum depression? Part of me is really scared of that. What if I get that baby and I’m so underwhelmed or maybe I just straight up don’t like it?? What if somehow I take out all of my pain and suffering on a child. What kind of horrible person would I be then. Fight so hard to get what I want, and then I hate it. Please God don’t let that happen.

I’m going to start birth control soon to get started with the next FET cycle. I wish I could close my eyes and skip to the end. I wish I didn’t ever have to step foot into that fertility clinic again - even though they are all so wonderful and lovely. What if deep down they’re just all sinister assholes extorting money from the sad and desperate? I really hope that’s not the case. But the pessimistic side of me feels that way sometimes.

I still feel like I want to hide from the world. I want to delete Facebook. I don’t ever want to take photos for clients ever again. 

Honestly, I feel pretty bitter with even my closest friends. My best friends. They don’t even ask me how I’m doing. Heck, they don’t say anything. The rational part of me understands that they have very very busy lives and I’m certain they think of me and wonder about me but are probably scared to ask and then all of a sudden it’s been weeks and they feel too guilty to ask now. But god dammit. My best best friend is in town and I don’t even want to SEE her. But I do actually, but the stupid grief makes me want to hide away and just be mad at everyone. 

Amie, Grandma, and Grandma - I hope you are taking care of my babies up there. I hope they’re safe and loved and have a better understanding of why they couldn’t be here with me instead - I’m still trying to work that one out myself. You can tell me when I see you again.

I think I am getting better and understanding that I need to just sit with my feelings right now and remember that it’s a normal part of grief. I’m going to start meditating and do more yoga / exercise and get myself up off the floor and move on. I hate when people say this, but fuck you 2016 - I fucking hate you (except our Florida vacation, I'll give you that one).

I guess I should know by now that I can’t predict the future, but I feel like 2017 is going to be better. Maybe not for the world (fuck you Trump). But I’m not going to focus on the world. Sorry not sorry. I’m going to focus on ME and my HUSBAND and making us a FAMILY. And making sure we’re a TEAM and we’re HAPPY and we’re HEALTHY.

The rational part of me understands that they have very very busy lives and I’m certain they think of me and wonder about me but are probably scared to ask and then all of a sudden it’s been weeks and they feel too guilty to ask now. But god dammit. My best best friend is in town and I don’t even want to SEE her. But I do actually, but the stupid grief makes me want to hide away and just be mad at everyone. </p>

<p>Amie, Grandma, and Grandma - I hope you are taking care of my babies up there. I hope they’re safe and loved and have a better understanding of why they couldn’t be here with me instead - I’m still trying to work that one out myself. You can tell me when I see you again.</p>

<p>I think I am getting better and understanding that I need to just sit with my feelings right now and remember that it’s a normal part of grief. I’m going to start meditating and do more yoga / exercise and get myself up off the floor and move on. I hate when people say this, but fuck you 2016 - I fucking hate you (except our Florida vacation, I&#39;ll give you that one).</p>

<p>I guess I should know by now that I can’t predict the future, but I feel like 2017 is going to be better. Maybe not for the world (fuck you Trump). But I’m not going to focus on the world. Sorry not sorry. I’m going to focus on ME and my HUSBAND and making us a FAMILY. And making sure we’re a TEAM and we’re HAPPY and we’re HEALTHY. </p>

<p>Amen. </p>

You should not require more praise and attention than your toddler. You're SUPPOSED to take care of your kids. That's why people who don't often go to jail. Please stop this mombie mentality. You are giving women a bad name.

To which I shrug and continue living my first world life.  The life that has been run by infertility for the past 12 years. Infertility has governed every decision I have made, and over-ruled the ones I attempted to make on my own, without her say.  

I have tried so hard to live a life of abundance that is good regardless of what she decides to give or take away on any given month.  But forcing myself to feel gratitude, joy and abundance in the face of repeated loss has nearly caused me to split in two.  I was always taught that joy could stamp out grief, so when grief began to be my constant companion (in conjunction with infertility), and I couldn’t “positive think” the grief away, I simply gave in to living life with a dual identity.  Real me, and the grief stricken me created by recurrent treatments.  Grief stricken me looks like a waify unkempt, abused little girl. She sits in the corner ready to lash out at the slightest offense.  Regular me looks like – regular me only a little pudgier and slower to smile.  

I absolutely hate treatments.  So on this, what I said would be my last treatment ever, I prepared myself for failure, as usual, but I expected it to be accompanied by an equally strong sense of relief that I never have to go through a treatment again.  I could finally let my wounds begin to heal. I could finally live life without planning around treatments, and due dates that never come to fruition.  I have been sadly surprised to feel no relief…yet.  Just deep, intense, sorrow.  Just tears for the three genetically tested “viable” embryos who existed as of January 1 this year, and no longer exist.  It hurts the most to admit how deeply I wanted them to become my children, and how much hope I had that one of them would. 

In our world, Big Fat Negatives are irritating and Big Fat Positives are intolerable.  But today, I can think of no better words to describe all the aspects of how I hurt inside.  The last call I will ever get from my clinic, with a short “I’m sorry, your test was negative”, felt despairingly big and fat.  The empty spot in my heart that I hoped would someday be filled with the love of my baby daughter feels big and fat. My rage that suffocates me in some moments feels big and fat.   The grief that lays heavy in every cell as I struggle to make all the daily motions my first-world life requires of me feels big and fat.  Indeed, there was nothing small about that final phone call except the sentence itself. 

If I have gained anything from battling with infertility for over a decade, it is the knowledge of what grief really is.  That it never fully goes away.  That you do in fact get better at living with it over time, and, it is a terrible, inevitable part of being human.  But on this, my last week of anxiety rewarded with big fat everything, the most important thing both sides of me have to offer is the knowledge that my grief was born out of hope and love. Big, fat, and worth it.  Of this I am positive.

Anyway...

After finding out yesterday that our beta test for IUI #6 came back negative and that it was back to the drawing board, my wife and I decided to go out for a bite to eat tonight and enjoy each other's company and mentally prepare for our next cycle of injectables. 

After dinner, we were walking to our car and my wife told me that she has a gift card to Meijer (like a Walmart for parts of the Midwest). 

""You know what we should get?"", she asks jokingly seductive with an eyebrow raised an a smile on her face.

""Condoms!"", I answer, also joking.

""That's definitely what I was thinking!"" She yells out loud while we begin laughing and laughing.

My husband and I are both 27 and have been trying to conceive for a little over 2 years. We started seeing our RE exactly a year ago and so far we know that my husband could probably sire an entire village while I have low FSH and super low progesterone. 

Our attempts so far are:

* 15 cycles the old fashioned way

* One cycle with just a trigger shot

* Three cycles of Clomid + trigger

* One cycle of Clomid + trigger + IUI

* One cycle of Follistim + trigger that resulted in a chemical pregnancy

By the evening, we decided to make the 5hr drive home so we could get him into a facility closer to home that could provide more detailed care. Max showed no improvement in 36hrs & we ran more tests, including a scan today that revealed his organs being overcome with cancer. 

Wednesday at 11am, a professional is coming to our home to put Max to sleep. My husband is going to pick him up from the animal hospital in the morning & take him on one last adventure. 

If it's not raining, he's going to take him down to the bayou where he can roam in the tall grass & be near the water. He picked up a cupcake, peanut butter balls & a pork chop for him today for his last meal. They will probably drink a Stella Artois together too. They're going to FaceTime me at some point before the doctor arrives. 

Before Max goes, my husband will make a paw impression using a kit a dear friend & neighbor so lovingly gave us when no local store he went to had one in stock. We will make an ornament out of the impression & remember Max most especially at this time of year. 

He will go in peace in his own bed, surrounded by his favorite octopus stuffed animal & with my husband by his side. I'm heartbroken I can't be there for both of them as I went forward with our planned trip to visit my parents in NC. Somehow I think it's better because my husband can have the space & privacy to grieve this. He brought Max into our relationship & while I've only had the pleasure of knowing the greatest dog in the world for 4.5 years, my husband rescued Max when he was 3. Max would have turned 13 in a few months. 

Max is a pure bred lab, meant to be an elite hunting dog for a corporate hunting outfit. He failed out & needed a home. My husband took him in & for the first time, Max saw cars & concrete. He lived outdoors for the first few years because he was so uneasy indoors. (Of course he eventually made his way into the house as he got more comfortable.)

My husband heard this song below for the first time in the radio today after visiting Max in the hospital. We think it's the perfect song for saying goodbye to our dear sweet dog.

Where Rainbows Never Die

I'm an old man now

I can't do nothing

Young folks don't pay me no mind

But in my day I sure was something

Before I felt the heavy hand of time

I'm an old man now

I'm bound for glory

Time to lay these burdens down

Had enough of this old world of worry

Gonna trade my troubles for a crown

I will make my way across the fields of cotton

And wade through muddy waters one last time

And in my dreams I come out clean

When I reach the other side

Waste away the sunsets

Where rainbows never die

I've got on last thing to do

One more mile before I'm through

Casting off these early chains

Going where theres no more pain

I will make my way across the fields of cotton

And wade through muddy waters one last time

And in my dreams I come out clean

When I reach the other side

Waste away the sunsets

I was hoping I would have a higher turnout but I am staying positive that I have any eggs or fertilization to begin with.

Other than a stupid head cold and gross bloating the side effects were not so terrible this month.  The IUI's with all the progesterone were much worse.  I guess that is what next month will be like with the progesterone shots- ugh.

There are so many new people here. I wish I could say I was happy about that. The love and support given and received here is indescribable. But, I wish you all didn't have to be here. But alas, here we are.

So, many of you might not recognize me, but [I'm kind of a big deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzx8KHjQD6c). I have many leather-bound infertility books and my apartment smells of rich Menopur.

Quick history: diagnosed with low AMH (0.998) by my OB, no MFI; everything else was normal (tubes clear, FSH, etc). I was sent right to the RE, do not pass go, do not collect $200. I had a persistent cyst that was keeping us from starting treatment. RE feared endo, had lap, confirmed endo, cystectomy, further reduced AMH (0.5) due to cystectomy, officially diagnosed DOR. Then, I changed REs, did an injectable intercourse cycle that failed even though I had a great response. Then, strait to IVF. First IVF was a long lupron protocol where I was over suppressed with BCPs and lupron. The plan was to freeze all and PGS. Well, we only got 6 eggs, 4 mature, 3 fertilized, 3 on day 3, 2 on day 5 but not blast yet, same on day 6, they arrested on day 7. It was a complete fucking fail. Then, we moved across the country. We got settled, found a new RE, did IVF #2. No priming aggressive antagonist cycle, plan was to do a day 3 fresh transfer. I responded better with 10 eggs, 8 mature, 6 fertilized, 4 on day 3. On day 3 we transferred 2 8-cell with 5% and 15% fragmentation, and we froze two 6-cell 5% fragmentation embryos. Betas were negative. Fuck me.

So, that's where we are. We had a WTF with our RE last Thursday to talk about what to do next. My husband wants to do an FET cycle with our 2 frozen embryos, but I want to do another retrieval first. I'm so scared that if we did the FET and didn't do another retrieval until later, my response wouldn't be as good. I mean, 10 eggs, however shitty, from a woman with DOR, AMH=0.5 (tested Jan 2016) is really good. I feel like we should capitalize on my ovaries being cooperative. Our RE agreed with me, sort of. She said that because my AMH is low due to endo and the cystectomy, and my FSH is only slightly higher than normal, she can't say for sure that my reserve is dwindling like she could say for an older woman with my same numbers but higher FSH (I'm 33, I certainly don't feel young). But, she did say that retrieving again now to bank as many embyos as we can was a good idea, just in case. 

When we started down the IVF path, my husband and I said we'd do 3 IVF cycles. We felt like 3 IVF cycles was a good effort to experiment with protocols, and it was also all of the money we are willing to invest in this before stopping treatment. So, that means, this next retrieval will be our last. I have all of the mixed feelings about this. I want this to work so much, but also so glad to see an end to this nightmare. 

The plan is to cycle again in 2 months and do another fresh transfer of 3 embryos. For the protocol, we asked about the micro-flare protocol, but we agreed to keep the same no-priming antagonist protocol as we did for IVF #2 and hope that we get the same response. I was kind of bummed we aren't switching it up, but I think that it's safer to go with what we know has produced a decent amount of eggs in the past. What do y'all think?

Also, regarding the two embryos we have on ice, I wasn't too hopeful for them, because they are 6-cell, but the RE swears they are good quality embryos because 4 to 8 cells is ideal on day 3 and they only have 5% fragmentation. I don't know, it's hard to know if she's being truthful or just hopeful for me. What do you guys think?

Lastly, this year can go fuck itself. So.Much.Bullshit. George Michael and now Carrie Fisher, and that's just *this week*. Fuck, this year cannot end soon enough.

My Wife and I made our first visit to the RE on the 23rd. The RE was very nice and reviewed all of our test results with us. He confirmed was we expected we are Unexplained Infernal. He said 10% of couple have trouble conceiving and 10% of those are unexplained. Yay...we are the 1% :(. 

He gave us the following options:

*  Laprascopy: likely won't find anything but if they could they might be able temporarily increase fertility
* IUI $1900 for 18% success rate
* IVF $15k plus medication for 60% success rate

We figured this would eventually be our conclusion. We still feel pretty defeated. The options are very expensive for a lot of uncertainty. We decided to give ourselves a month to think about our options.

This might be a sore subject here but we are also considering adoption. We live in a county that provides adoption services. We have conflicting feeling about this. It seems difficult to spend thousands on a chance to conceive when there are children already in this world that would love to be part of our family. But we are concerned about the special needs an adopted child may need. 

A few days after our appointment we talked to a friend that is a mutual friend of my Mom. I guess she confessed to them that She strongly wanted us to have our own biological kids. She told me told me the costs are small in the grand scheme of life. That is easier for her to say when we could spend the money and still not conceive. I know She would be a great Grandma no matter what we choose but it is frustrating to hear this indirectly. We obviously want this too. It is easy for Her to say when she has zero issues having children. 

It is difficult to envision growing old without having Children. It is especially hard around the holiday and seeing how great my Wife is with kids. She would be such an excellent Mother.

For those that do not follow the results thread, I got a ""free baby"" a little over 2 weeks ago...betas rose but progesterone, even on supplements was crap. RE suspected ectopic. We had an ultrasound yesterday..I was 5 weeks 5 days and his suspicions were right.  Sac in my left tube.  Surgery was yesterday afternoon.  All care providers were very sweet and helpful. It sucks having to answer ""no, never been pregnant before"". ""About 5.5 weeks along"" and various other pregnancy questions over and over, but it went ok.   


Then comes in the OR nurse... After repeating these questions she tells me ""my first pregnancy was ectopic too.  I know what you are going through"".  Wow I think, this is going to be really great to have someone who gets it..then she adds ""so get this out of the way and you will go on to have great pregnancies after.  Next thing you know you'll be like me with a couple little ones running around.""   I wanted to die.  I'm not going to have little ones lady... You don't know me and my situation.  My left tube is now gone and my right side doesn't seem to ovulate like ever!  I had a cyst in the right tube most of this year (removed in sept) and the RE is saying another pregnancy would be extremely high risk for ectopic.  I'm not even sure if we will attempt natural conception anymore.  We had already decided we could never pursue ivf due to the costs.   So OR nurse...

<p>For those that do not follow the results thread, I got a &quot;free baby&quot; a little over 2 weeks ago...betas rose but progesterone, even on supplements was crap. RE suspected ectopic. We had an ultrasound yesterday..I was 5 weeks 5 days and his suspicions were right.  Sac in my left tube.  Surgery was yesterday afternoon.  All care providers were very sweet and helpful. It sucks having to answer &quot;no, never been pregnant before&quot;. &quot;About 5.5 weeks along&quot; and various other pregnancy questions over and over, but it went ok.   </p>

<p>Then comes in the OR nurse... After repeating these questions she tells me &quot;my first pregnancy was ectopic too.  I know what you are going through&quot;.  Wow I think, this is going to be really great to have someone who gets it..then she adds &quot;so get this out of the way and you will go on to have great pregnancies after.  Next thing you know you&#39;ll be like me with a couple little ones running around.&quot;   I wanted to die.  I&#39;m not going to have little ones lady... You don&#39;t know me and my situation.  My left tube is now gone and my right side doesn&#39;t seem to ovulate like ever!  I had a cyst in the right tube most of this year (removed in sept) and the RE is saying another pregnancy would be extremely high risk for ectopic.  I&#39;m not even sure if we will attempt natural conception anymore.  We had already decided we could never pursue ivf due to the costs.   So OR nurse... Please don&#39;t just give patients a blanket &quot;fix it&quot; statement like this...it doesn&#39;t help your patient one bit.  </p>

They hung around, we didn't really think anything of it. Then we sit down and talk... they all of a sudden go sooooo with big smiles on their faces.... I knew instantly, my brother was over last week talking about how they were trying (we knew they would right away) and I warned him I wouldn't likely take a surprise pregnancy announcement from them well because it should be/been us and it makes it hard for me to be happy instantly. I think I handled it pretty well but I didn't jump for joy or act surprised either.  Oops. Inside I couldn't even feel happy because well you know why. I always wanted a Christmas announcement of our baby finally joining us but that seems like it's never going to happen at this point. 

But the real kicker is she has no clue about what you have to do for pregnancy. She isn't on prenatal, she was upset she can't have Red Bull, I told her about foods to avoid, what she needs to do like go to a doctor request a blood test, etc. How can you be so unprepared when you WANTED a baby! 

Anyway I was prepared for our friends to announce but not my brother and SIL. But they were very nice in telling us first I do appreciate that so much.

My husband and I often email back and forth during the work day, since we're both very busy and rarely have time to talk. I received a lovely email from him today saying he was, ""feeling down"" because of the ""difficulties we've had with getting pregnant"".

Some background: I have PCOS with a very unpredictable cycle. We've been trying for just about a year with no signs of success. I had a HSG test two months ago which came back normal and gave us a lot of hope. For some reason, the last two cycles since the HSG were normal for me, which never happens. I had a period all on my own the last two months. But this month, no go. I'm 4 days late and the last two tests I've taken have been negative (one on the day I was due and one two days later). So I started progesterone yesterday.

We've been trying really hard the last few months. I ovulate on my own, but my cycle is unpredictable. After hearing that a lot of people just happen to get pregnant a month or two after the HSG, we tried extra hard the last two months and we're both really bummed that it didn't work.

Anyway, to get to my point, what do you tell your husband (or partner) when he says he's down because you can't get pregnant?

Overall, she said my labs were good except for the high prolactin.
Prolactin: 45.6
TSH: 1.39
Estrogen: 41.1
FSH: 5.74

Ultrasound: 3 cysts that were clear, 2 on right ovary, 1 on left ovary, antral follicle count is 23.

If you can please help with the following questions, I would be MOST GRATEFUL. I am on the verge of tears sitting here alone. 

1. The nurse on the phone said my prolactin was very high and asked if I was fasting. I was technically fasting, because I woke up in the morning and went to the doc office before eating breakfast. She says that it is a high number, and that they will repeat the lab draw next week, and if it is still high, I have to get a brain MRI. That got me really, really, really scared. What does that mean? Why do I need an MRI? Is there a tumor or something I should be afraid of? Anyone else have experience with this?

2. Is my antral follicle count good? 

3. She said the cysts on my ovaries were clear. What does that mean?

Background

I'm 34f. 

About 12 years ago I was in an unhappy relationship (drug use by him) when I found out I was pregnant. I had a termination at 5 weeks. 

In my mid twenties I met and married a guy and we tried to conceive for about 12 months before the marriage broke down in part because of the stress of trying. He had known sperm issues and I had been pregnant before so in the back of my mind I wasn't too worried the issue was me. How naive. 

A few years later I met my current partner. TTC for 12 months. I was very worried at the 3 months and then 6 months point but we have had a LOT of family stress and it never seemed like the right time to investigate the issue. To give you an idea we've moved 5 times in 12 months. Dealt with deaths in the family, family mental health issues, deaths of friends. In summary life has in general been very shit. 

In October I finally decided to make an appointment with an RE and he ordered a bunch of tests. He described a not-so-positive picture that IVF was our only hope. I can't remember all my results but basically 5 follicles total, AMH of I think 2, and FSH of 19. I was told I was DOR and to expect early menopause. But that IVF was ""worth a go"". In retrospect i think the RE felt he had to at least offer us something. So we paid up and booked a cycle for November. 

At day 2 I went and did the blood test and was heading home on public transport to do my first injection, waiting to hear from the nurse what dose to use. The nurse called me to tell me that they were cancelling the cycle as my FSH was too high. I was crushed. Then the RE called me and said that I could try again next cycle but made it clear to me that there was a very strong chance that would be cancelled also as my FSH was unlikely to go down and given the rest of my picture there was only the tiniest of chances.

He said we should have a think about a donor as the only hope.

I went from making my first appointment to being told there was no chance in the space of 2 months. Do not pass go, do not collect $100. Straight to infertile. 

So my partner and I have been discussing what to do this last month. I am a mess. Seriously. I am taking extended leave from work as I'm in tears all day. 

My partner and I live with my sister so I told her, as I was obviously depressed. She is three years younger and has a casual partner. She was very had to talk to just yelling at me at some stage ""I don't understand!! Just use a donor!! Who cares how much it costs!!"".

I feel very alone and isolated. This past week my partner and I came to a preliminary decision to not try donor. It's too financially taxing for us. I'm not sure I'm okay with the decision but I am experiencing some sense of relief at having at least a ""decision"".

Then my sister comes home last night and tells me she is accidentally pregnant. She was worried about telling me but knew she had to. I know that and I'm happy for her. But... man. I have no words. I am in so much pain. 

Now I read your stories here and I feel lucky (that's not quite the right word but you know what I mean) that I didn't have to STIM, I haven't have the loss of miscarriage, I haven't spent my life savings, all to get to this point I know so many of us are at. But part of me feels i just went from oblivious to no hope so soon I'm so heartbroken I never ever got a chance. 

So now I have to move again. I can't live with my sister. It will destroy me. I've opted out of everything Christmas wise and will be househunting hopefully next week. I am only hanging on by the thinnest of threads and have to remind myself of the pain suicide causes to those left behind to get through the day.

Thanks for your ear. I just don't know where else to turn to.

You all may remember my post earlier about my e-tegrity test (http://www.etegritytest.com/) that showed that my lining was out of phase and that I had zero beta-3 integrin, a protein associated with implantation. This might be just because my endometrium is out of phase, but it also might be because of latent endometriosis. 

I got back my igenomix ERA results, and it also thinks I'm out of phase, specifically that my last FET was done when my endometrium was pre-receptive. This handy test does recommend a target embryo transfer date: 1 day later. More on this test: http://www.igenomix.com/tests/endometrial-receptivity-test-era/

So, we're going to do the next FET with 6 not 5 days of progesterone treatment which some places do as standard anyway. And to be sure that any potential latent endometriosis is gone, I'm going to do 2 months of Depot Lupron (not regular lupron) treatment. Has anyone else had this? Apparently the result is medically-induced menopause. What better way to ring in the new year... ;-)

I also pushed to get my thyroid tested and to get my prolactin retested. I want everything to be in tip-top shape for my next FET in a few months.

Thank you all for all of the support and advice. This is a great community.

I have been a lurker for a loooong time and even without posting have gotten so much support, information, and solidarity from this community! I'm coming out of lurking to request some thoughts, opinions, information, whatever you have!

Some context - I'm 30 (partner is 35) and we've been trying for like.... 18 cycles now?? We didn't see an RE right at the year mark because we were in the process of moving and didn't want to establish care somewhere only to move away and do it all over again. So, a couple months ago we got settled, saw an RE, and got the process started. All my bloodwork, egg count, etc., is great (or at least within normal limits), and husband's SA was great, and I had been tracking and temping so I  was relatively confident that I was ovulating and having pretty consistent 27-day cycles. Then I went in for a FemVue (like the HSG but supposed to be a little more comfortable, bubbles instead of dye) and it showed that both my tubes were totally blocked. Well, shit. 

At that point our RE laid out our options as: 1) HSG to confirm and potentially clear tubes if it was something minor blocking them; 2) laparoscopy surgery to confirm endometriosis and clear out tubes; or 3) IVF. We opted for HSG to confirm since apparently the Femvue has like a 30% false positive rate or something (!!!), and that is happening tomorrow. 

At this point I am expecting that the HSG tomorrow will confirm blocked tubes and not do anything to clear them out (I have suspected for a long time I might have endometriosis - a mostly irrational fear based on a few symptoms, but hey, maybe not that irrational after all!). What we are trying to decide at this point is whether it is worth it to attempt the surgery to clear the tubes, or better just to jump straight to IVF. 

On the one hand, our insurance does partially cover the surgery, and the chance at an actual fix is so appealing, even if it's not fixed for forever. Plus it would allow us to confirm the endometriosis and stage it, which would provide additional information. I guess the downsides of the surgery are that it doesn't have great success rates in the medical literature, and so the concern is that it might just turn out to be an unnecessary surgery, and obviously I'd like to avoid undergoing a surgery under general anesthesia if it's not going to be helpful. Also I understand there may be slightly higher risk of ectopic pregnancy post-surgery? I would love to hear from anyone else who's been in a similar position with regard to blocked tubes, and hear what you decided to do, why you made that decision, how it's working out for you, etc. 

Another factor, not related to the medical stuff/decision-making - my best friend since high school was also struggling with fertility issues - they had been trying for just 8 months, but she wasn't ovulating, so she did a round of Clomid, and just found out that she is pregnant. I am beyond thrilled for her, but we were each other's main support and outlet for the sucky TTC process, and so I'm feeling a little more alone now. Which probably also influenced why I'm coming out of lurking now - just looking for a little more support and a place to discuss, process, and most importantly hear about all of your journeys! So, hi! And I'd love to hear from you!

I'm a lower-20's male who dated a lower-20's female. We got fairly careless with sex as after dating for a year, she didn't get pregnant and said it'd be a miracle if she did as her doctors said that even though she gets her period, she had some sort of fertility issue - not sure which.

She ended up getting pregnant, and we made the decision to use misoprostol and mifepristone. We used proper dosage and administration and everything appeared to go fine.

Fast forward to ~7 months after the miscarriage occurred. She had been having her period but it suddenly stopped. Tonight, she contacted me and claimed that she went to 4 different doctors, saying that each time the first thing they did was ask if she ever had an abortion and saying that's why. She now holds the fact that she cannot have kids against me.

I'm very shocked by this news, as before we even got the pills we did extensive research into whether or not it would likely cause infertility. We found many sources saying it does not and absolutely none documenting medical abortion-induced infertility.

I feel horrible about the entire situation even though she says it isn't my fault. But most of all I am absolutely mindfucked... why would an abortion procedure deemed ""safe"" from causing infertility work like a charm, result in normal function for 7 months, then suddenly destroy the entire uterus? 

I NEED to know the truth. Whether it's what I want to hear (""She's lying, it doesn't cause infertility, the infertility was likely caused by the underlying problem"") or what I don't want to hear (""Yes, she would likely still be fertile were it not for the procedure."")

I assured them that I have been sitting on my couch all day waiting for this package and that a tag was never left and my doorbell only rang when UPS delivered. 
So my problem now is that it is 20 degrees outside and I have no idea if the package is somewhere too cold or too warm (it needs to be refrigerated and comes with an ice pack). I am so beyond upset at the thought that my medication will not be okay for my upcoming IUI. My New Year miracle may have just gone down in flames. Or ice. Anybody have experience with this? Should I just call the pharmacy in the morning? </p>

Mrs.benihanacumberbatch  and I (I'm the dude, as we share this account) are deep into IVF and have been for some time.  We moved to our current city in July of this year and don't have many friends out here.  

We were friendly in the early part of 2016 with our real estate agent who is a nice guy that helped us buy a place.  We've kept in touch on and off during the year.  He and his wife bought a house a few months ago and we suspected that they were trying for kids.

We just got an email from them to meet up where the husband announced they were expecting in May.  I guess since we were sort of expecting it there wasn't too much shock for us.  They would like to meet up for coffee and to chat.  We've never all actually met together in person funnily enough.

I guess we're just sort of looking for advice on how to handle things.  We're not close enough that they know about our situation, nor do we know how they'd react or if we should say anything.  We'd probably be more cagey about meeting up except for the fact that we actually would like to meet some new people (even pregnant ones).

We have some thoughts on what to do but since this is sort of new territory we'd appreciate any advice.

Since I began monitoring my cycles I have identified a pattern in that I'll get my period, followed by a positive OPK on CD14, then AF will arrive up to 12 days later, sometimes even as early as 9 DPO.

I have just finished two rounds of Clomid without success. The first round I took 25mg without monitoring, and I had a period followed by 4 days of spotting, and then never got a positive OPK and then started my period on CD23 while I was still waiting to see if I ovulated late. I was really frustrated as I did get positive OPKs before. The second round of Clomid I took 50mg and I had a longer period (around 8 days, but not as heavy) then I took OPK's from the day my period finished. I then began bleeding again at CD11 (just spotting for the first few days but it then turned into a period-type bleeding and lasted about 7 days in total). I called my fertility clinic and had a scan on CD13, where I was told I had already ovulated as she could see two follicles that had already ovulated and my lining wasn't three-layered as you'd expect before ovulation. I was really confused because I didn't get a positive OPK and I was doing them regularly, and also I was bleeding so if I ovulated then I must have begun bleeding straight away.

We're on a TI cycle with femara. I've taken it a couple of times before and I've only had an anovulatory cycle once in the last few years. Just trying to get me to ovulate sooner. 

This cycle I took 5mg femara day 4-8 and had a CD 13 and 15 check. When my follicles didn't change size and my lining shrank, they gave me another dose of 7.5 femara for 5 days and told me to come back in a week. Also to not have sex because they were concerned about HOM. I was worried I would ovulate before the next scan but grateful that they called me in a day earlier than anticipated.

Sure enough, I go to my scan after the second round of meds and the biggest follicle was12mm. I told them that the night before and the morning of the scan I was having ovulation pains and EWCM. They sent me off for a progesterone lab (1.8) and called me that afternoon to tell me that I didn't respond to the meds so would have to see the doc NEXT MONTH. So I would lose this cycle and the next.

I kept tracking my temps. 97.2 the morning of the last scan. Lo and behold it went up to above 98 by the next day and stayed that way for 3 more days. I called today to request a P4 redraw becuase I think I ovulated and they missed it and I don't want to talk to the doc about changing a protocol when this one obviously worked. 

They argued with us. Told us that P4 surges right at ovulation and that by now (3 days later) it possibly would have already gone down. I told them that if I had ovulated a mere few hours before the scan that there's a pretty good chance my P4 just didn't get high enough yet. That even if my labs were higher I should come in for a meeting with the RE and discuss what to do next. 

At this point we're pissed. It sure seems like they aren't handling things properly and aren't willing to look at all the puzzle pieces before making a decision on treatment protocol.

Sorry for the long rant. I needed to vent and hopefully get some assurance that they are the ones in the wrong and not us.  Thanks, guys.

I decided to join this group because since I got my IUD out last May, I have not ovulated yet, and I'm getting two periods a month.

I was referred to an OB/GYN who did a panel of bloodwork (all within the normal range), and a saline infusion sonohysterogram.

With the creation of /r/IFseniorclass, a lot of the regularly contributing members here have moved on to the new sub, especially for the daily thread. It's the right move for them but I'm feeling like I lost a connection to some people I've talked to for months now. I've been a regular member here since July 2016 so I definitely still have both feet firmly planted in /r/infertility. I'm noticing a flood of new users and I think it would be a great idea if you're planning to contribute regularly to the sub, if everyone could re-introduce themselves so we know some of your backstory. It would also be great if you could add a flare (see the sidebar). It helps to know where you are in your IF journey. Personally, I don't want to tell someone something they already know. It's a different conversation if you're just going to a RE for the first time or on IVF #3.

- The trophectoderm grade is given a letter a-d.  Stage 4 and before embryos don't have this grade.

The clinic only freezes or transfers 4 or later (for day 5 transfer), and they must have a grade that is B or better or b or better.  Embryos graded C, D, Cc, Cd, DC, or Dd are discarded.

We initially did 6 rounds of clomid and then went straight to IVF. I've done two fresh IVF, one frozen transfer. My most recent round this month was slow growth in stims, only two useful follicles, went ahead with retrieval anyway (I go to a lower cost clinic so worth a shot). As part of low cost, retrieval is done conscious, with fentanyl to make you ""floaty"" and a local anaesthetic to the ovary. I've powered through a 16 egg retrieval before, so expected to breeze through 2. The fentanyl stopped working after 1 minute. The left hand side local didn't work. The right side did. I was pretty upset from the experience,  but one out of two fertilised and I geared up for transfer. That part is always easy!

<p>We initially did 6 rounds of clomid and then went straight to IVF. I&#39;ve done two fresh IVF, one frozen transfer. My most recent round this month was slow growth in stims, only two useful follicles, went ahead with retrieval anyway (I go to a lower cost clinic so worth a shot). As part of low cost, retrieval is done conscious, with fentanyl to make you &quot;floaty&quot; and a local anaesthetic to the ovary. I&#39;ve powered through a 16 egg retrieval before, so expected to breeze through 2. The fentanyl stopped working after 1 minute. The left hand side local didn&#39;t work. The right side did. I was pretty upset from the experience,  but one out of two fertilised and I geared up for transfer. That part is always easy!</p>

167,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"In October, we saw the fertility clinic doctor and he was like 'yes! We should start IVF! Oh wait no, all your test results are two years old because we'be taken so long to get around to you, we need day 1 bloods, and to redo your AMH, and day 1 ultrasounds. Oh, and your husband should wank into a cup again even though it's only been six months. Here's some cyclogest to get your period started, come back on the 1st of December and we will get started with IVF.""

Three days later I got pregnant. When my period never started after the cyclogest, I took a test and nearly threw up in surprise. Eight rounds of clomid in the space of a year had obviously made me slightly more fertile than usual.

At five weeks, I started bleeding. They told me to take the cyclogest pessaries again. Two days later the bleeding got worse. They checked my hCG levels, and declared that 20,900 at less than six weeks pregnant was super-high, and the pregnancy was definitely viable. They started giving me PIO injections. The next day the bleeding got worse, and I went to hospital. A doctor announced that my cervix was closed and it wasn't *that* much blood.

Finally sent for an ultrasound at 5w6. I am still bleeding, and I know the baby is fucking gone. Naturally, in the maternity ultrasound suite where they do all the infertility and miscarriage scans, there are two heavily pregnant women! And wouldn't you know! They're both having twins! They coo conspiratorially about how much *better* having TWO ENTIRE BABIES is.

I barely manage to stutter out ""I'm actually having a miscarriage. Could we please talk about something else."" NATURALLY the response from one of the women is that probably I deserve it because I am SO MEAN and HATE JOY and am SO RUDE. Naturally, the staff wander in and out of the room while this woman is berating me, but choose not to do anything about it. I agree, I am mean and rude and hate JOY, please can we talk about anything else. (The answer is a resounding no, and I leave in tears when the topic turns back to 'they are SO WRIGGLY' and 'TWO ENTIRE BABIES'.)

Eventually they get round to scanning me without an extended wait in the Waiting Room Of Joy And So Many Babies. Empty sac. ""Maybe it's still too early!"" the Early Pregnancy Midwife cheerfully tells me. She takes a repeat hCG because no one else has, and the results are 13,000. ""It's still higher than expected, maybe you lost a twin!"" she tells me.

Repeat ultrasound a week later: still an empty sac, but it's grown! And my hCG is now 27,000! It's doubled in a week! It's not that bad! The midwife was so optimistic. So were all the fertility nurses, who were giving me my daily butt injections. Everyone kept telling me how soooo many women bleed in pregnancy, and asking what I'm gonna name the baby.

Around week six, I started getting nauseous. Really, really, really nauseous. ""Think of it as good news!"" three different nurses told me.

Third ultrasound: empty sac, which hadn't grown. Finally everyone stops cooing at me that everything is probably fine, and I stop having to have butt injections.

I go downstairs to the fertility clinic to tell them I don't need butt injections any more, and someone brings in a newborn baby to show off. I just fucking walk out. Naturally, there is a stall selling handknitted baby clothes right outside the fertility clinic.

Fourth ultrasound: suddenly they're all 'oh shit, maybe this is a molar pregnancy'. The Early Pregnancy Midwife is incredulous. She does another hCG test. It's 27,000. She rings me sounding panicked, makes an appointment for me to see an actual doctor at the hospital the next morning.

The doctor takes a lengthy history, puts his hand over mine and tells me that my pregnancy isn't progressing. *No fucking shit.* ""You must be six or seven weeks by now, and we can't see anything on the ultrasounds."" he explains. I'm nine fucking weeks pregnant. It annoys me that he doesn't know that. He recommends a D&C the next day, in case it is a molar pregnancy.

I am very reluctant. I had a D&C at 13weeks after a MMC in February, got a weirdly vague letter for a follow up six months later except they never answered their phone or returned my messages, so they haven't even checked that they didn't do any damage the first fucking time yet.

But I am Obediant, so I get up at 6 fucking am the next day to go to hospital to get my womb hoovered. The nurse seems surprised when I arrive. Twenty minutes later the nurse comes to find me, and takes me to an open ward.

I sit down on the bed and start crying. At this point I have been crying pretty much constantly for weeks. The woman in the bed next to me, separated only by a curtain that reaches to about knee level, laughs and whispers to her boyfriend. I just about fucking lost it.

My husband goes to find a nurse, and calmly explains to the nurse that I am here very reluctantly for extremely traumatic and upsetting surgery, and I need to be in a private room, like I was last time. The nurse comes to tell me ""emergencies come in, we can't guarantee a private room"". I managed to blurt ""well I can't guarantee you access to my vagina"" before leaving.

I have had e-fucking-nough. 

I knew at five weeks that this pregnancy wasn't fucking viable, and I have spent a whole month trying to persuade people of that fact. Now it's possibly cancerous - after they spent three weeks determinedly trying to make it grow with hormone injections! - and I am expected to submit to a hand up my vagina with a *fucking audience*.

I'm considering paying actual money to get the D&C done privately, though we can't really afford it. But honestly I'm mostly tempted to just... not doing anything. Is it completely irresponsible to just refuse to do anything, go anywhere, or talk to anyone? (Probably.) Should I consider a career in predicting the dismal future with horrifying accuracy while no one believes me? Is it unreasonable to just give the fuck up and assume that my eggs are made of fucking rocks?

170,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all. My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for two years with zero luck. Never pregnant and, until yesterday, we had no idea why. I found out yesterday that my ovulatory reserve is really low at .36. So basically, I have very few viable eggs left. I'm only 31 years old, so this is quite a blow for me. My FSH levels are normal. My doctor has put me on Femara, but I've been reading that women with low ovulatory reserve don't typically respond well to meds. Am I just out of luck? My husband and I decided to spend 2017 trying meds and monitoring, and then move on to adoption if it doesn't happen.

My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for two years with zero luck. Never pregnant and, until yesterday, we had no idea why. I found out yesterday that my ovulatory reserve is really low at .36. So basically, I have very few viable eggs left. I&#39;m only 31 years old, so this is quite a blow for me. My FSH levels are normal. My doctor has put me on Femara, but I&#39;ve been reading that women with low ovulatory reserve don&#39;t typically respond well to meds. Am I just out of luck? My husband and I decided to spend 2017 trying meds and monitoring, and then move on to adoption if it doesn&#39;t happen.

I feel like it might explain a little bit of my relief and fear (not that you all don't completely understand, because you totally know). 

""I will be stimulating you very aggressively, aiming not only to generate the most vigorous response possible, but also because if we are not able to generate a reasonable response we will be more confident about concluding that cannot be achieved. Because you are rather unlikely to have a great response to stimulation, it is then less likely that we can expect to generate more embryos of quality than we would be prepared to transfer and that could then be frozen.  A scenario wherein one cycle of stimulation will yield not only one or two quality embryos for fresh transfer BUT ALSO others in a number sufficient for not only ONE but TWO later frozen embryo transfers seems very, very unlikely to me.  It is perhaps more likely that IF we can generate the response needed to get to retrieval and ultimately to embryo transfer, we will not have extras for freezing, which, if you don't conceive from the fresh transfer and we judge the effort worthwhile, might then be more likely to result in a new stimulation. I'm not sure this is helpful and I do wish that I could provide you with more certainty, but I can't.  I can only advise you on what I honestly think is most likely to happen."" The TL;DR of this is, I don't expect you to have a good response to stims and if you don't, we'll have been as aggressive as possible, so it won't reasonably be worth trying again with your own eggs.

Now, back to now... it's trigger day! I did 11 days of stims. My E2 is 2029 pg/mL and my P4 is 1.01 ng/mL and I have 6 (**SIX**) mature follicles and 4 smaller ones (still measurable (ie over 10mm), but not over 15).  So far this has exceeded my low expectations which, in turn, just makes me scared of the fucking hope. Retrieval at 8:30 on Friday morning. I feel like I'm getting greedy...I don't want to be devastated on Friday at retrieval, but I'm so overwhelmed at how well I've responded (comparatively) and I'm all hopeful that I'll get more than the 3 eggs that I decided were enough on stim day 5. And then, you know, the hunger games, and, omg all the scareds.

My protocol for reference: Estrace priming, Microdose lupron flare (20 units 2x/day) started at the same time as other stims (which seems different from most, but this might be because of how my clinic batches cycles), Gonal F 375 IU, Menopur 75 IU, 20 units human growth hormone (omnitrope).

Incidentally, my amazing RE who did so much to get me here (and wrote that email above) and kept trying to start me in October and November and delaying me because of dumb cysts (telling me LIES that my ovaries are not working against me, lol). The last time I saw him, he prescribed provera for 7 days to fake a luteal phase to line up my start date right before thanksgiving. He promptly went on a cruise and has been gone the ENTIRE time from start to now, but apparently is attending tomorrow and doing my retrieval. I can't wait to see what he has to say and if he's pleased/excited/shocked/surprised/whatever. Is that weird?

Anyway, this is long so I decided not to put it in the daily, hope that's ok.  

ETA: Will I need the percocet that they prescribe... or perhaps more importantly, IF I need it, will I need it right after retrieval (and I should get it filled today) or it'll be ok if I get it filled after leaving retrieval?

I started this off as an update for the daily thread but it got too long. I barely slept last night. I don't know how fixable of a problem this is yet for my particular result.

Yesterday, I got back one of the results of my endometrial receptivity assay but I'm still waiting on the second part. 

As far as I can tell, it's close to the worst possible result I could get. It means I have little chance of having an embryo implant without treatment. This test is the e-tegrity test if you want to look it up. And it can also detect latent endometriosis.

I have literally zero beta-3 integrin in my endometrium. Until last night, I had never heard of that. This sub and IFbabies even have little info. Apparently this is a protein necessary for implantation. You have to have a level of at least 0.7 and I had literally zero. Not even 0.01. 

This protein is often missing in people with endometriosis. Wait, you say, you don't have Endo or its major symptom of painful periods! That was right, but maybe I do have latent endometriosis.

The treatment is a combination of letrozole and 1-3 months of lupron. That can help. But for someone who has literally zero... I'm not super optimistic.

Oh, and my lining, which always looks beautiful in ultrasounds, is also tested as ""out of phase"" for successful implantation.

Goodbye, January transfer. You were made out of butterflies and wishful thinking that this round of tests would come out OK. I guess my Teflon-coated uterus is a key part of the reason why I've never had a positive test.

And the second ERA test result is still yet to come. Then we'll make a plan with the RE for what to try. 

For those following the saga, here's what's on the infertility shitpile already:

* Clotting issues: MTHFR homozygous c677t, pai-1 4g/4g, heterozygous for factor XIII - to treat with lovenox
* Immune issues: elevated NK cells and cytokines to treat with intralipid
* One failed FET with a PGS normal embryo
* Egg quality issues (discovered through 3 egg retrievals)
* Luteal phase detect

The one thing making me happy right now is the bitter vindication of paranoia. My RE wanted to go ahead with more transfers. The failed FET only had a 50% chance of success. I wanted to do more testing. Haha, I was right?

At 27 I came in and heard, ""You're so young.  PCOS is no big deal.  My PCOS patients get pregnant all the time.  You're gonna see.""  I just turned 29, and after 8 cycles of clomid and femara, one unmedicated cycle, 2 IUIs, and an IVF retrieval that yielded 19 mature eggs (total of 6 frozen), I really thought I was finally getting close today on my first transfer day. I had a 3ab, I've been taking progesterone, and everything seemed good (minus a cold I've had, but they felt comfortable I could go forward in spite of it).  I'm always pessimistic because it never works out, but today I actually let myself feel hopeful.  I even got my photo of the embryo and I started crying happy tears.  It sounds stupid, but I let myself feel excited.

All the nurses I've talked to and everything I read pointed to it being a 10 minute procedure.  They worked on me for 5 hours and could not the catheter into my uterus.  An hour in, the doctor assured me that in her whole career she's never been unable to perform a transfer on a patient and that it was just a new challenge.  Four hours later, she finally got the narrow catheter in.  (Apparently, my cervix is twisted and too tight and a cyst that wasn't there a couple months ago was blocking the entrance to the uterus.)  So, they finally take out my beautiful embryo and for a moment I got to watch it on the big screen hatching, but when they went to put it in, they couldn't get the wider catheter in that contained the embryo and it got lost.  It might have ended up in my cervix, might have ended up caught in cervical mucus, but they couldn't find it and couldn't complete the transfer after what was essentially a 5 hour pap smear.   So, it's likely the embryo will disintegrate wherever it is.  

I feel terrible, but I almost feel worse for my doctor who was beside herself that it happened.  She was really nice about it and got on the phone to call colleagues at other practices to see if they'd ever experienced this.  Apparently, consensus was that several had had one case of this in their careers.  I've never had a desire to be special in any way and I never wanted my fertility (or lack thereof) to be what set me apart.  The truth is, I didn't even think this transfer would lead to a baby.

Tw: IVF and loss

Hi everyone. I did an IVF (in vitro fertilization) cycle this summer and had a loss subsequent to that. I'm 28 so they expected a large number of eggs but instead, only retrieved 9 and 4 fertilized. 4 made it to the 5 blastocyst stage but now there's 3 left. At first my RE (reproductive endocrinologist) didn't want to genetically test them but with the loss, she felt it would be better to do so and allow less anxiety for myself after our FET attempt in the next few months. 

Has anyone done PGS or PGD on 3 embryos and received good results? My fear is finding out all are not viable, which is better that I know now, but still- that would really suck.

I will continue that until Jan 7th.  On Jan 2nd, I'll add lupron 10 units.  On Jan 13th, I'll go in for monitoring and if everything is good to go, we'll drop lupron to 5 units, add Gonal-F (I assume 450, that's what we did last time) and Lo-dose HCG (I assume 20, and eventually raise to 50), with a retrieval planned for around the 25th if this cycle goes the way the last 2 did.  This is the same protocol as cycle 2.  Cycle 1 was a bust, and cycle 2 went better, so that's what we are sticking with.  Here are my 2 questions for those of you who have been here.

1) Last cycle I was on BCP for about a week, maybe a week and a half before starting Lupron.  This time I'll be on it for a month.  Is there a chance I can over suppress?  I don't have DOR or POF, but my egg count tends to be on the low side because we are basically working with 1 ovary.  Is 1 month too long, or will the time not really matter?

2) The past 2 cycles I've been on lo-dose HCG.  I hate that stuff..it makes me NUTS.  Last cycle I swear my hubby and our 2 100+ pound dogs hid for 2 straight days when they upped my dose from 20 to 50...I was just so angry all of the time.  When we had our WTF appointment with the RE, she said she'd consider switching me to menopur instead, and she wrote it down.  When I talked to my nurse this week, she said we were doing HCG.  I asked her to check with the RE, and she did, and they agree...HCG.  I don't know if RE forgot, or if something changed and she realized that the menopur was a no-go for me for whatever reason.  I can't decide if I want to push it or not.  For those of you who have taken menopur...any interesting side affects?  Anyone taken both?  Which is easier on moods.  I can handle physical symptoms much more than I can do the psychological ones.  I'd rather be in pain than be cranky and not be able to fix it.

I do not suffer from infertility myself but I have questions that have to do with it, so someone suggested me to post here. I hope it's not a problem if I do. (Also, I'm not an english native speaker, sorry if I make mistakes/am unclear)

First, a bit of context. I recently learned that it was legal to donate eggs in my country (France); I hadn't even heard of it before but got curious about it after reading stuff on reddit. I have some close friends who struggle with conceiving and it makes them very unhappy; I am very lucky to have healthy eggs, so now that I'm aware I can actually give them to other people I have begun the process to do so. (Not to my friends, they're not dealing with an egg problem, but I wanted to help with the general issue)

The ""problem"" I have with it is communication. From previous experience (I've been a volunteer in a clinical study for an experimental HIV vaccine), I know that when I tell people about a heavy, constraining and painful medical process I'm going through while not ""needing"" it, it pretty much always devolves in an annoying conversation about how it's risky and I probably shouldn't do it. Or they just don't understand why I bother doing something so obviously uncomfortable. I guess I could just avoid talking about it, but it's hard when there are constraints that people will likely notice, and anyway that's actually something I'd like to raise awareness about.

So here are my actual requests, if you don't mind answering. I would like to have:

1) Information about the whole process; the stimulation part is apparently the same one that women trying to have an IVF go through, so there are probably people on this sub who can tell me about it. I already had the point of view of my doctor but would like to hear about the experience of people who actually went through it. It could help me reassure people, explain them what's gonna happen to me, and also allow me to be better prepared.

2) Information/arguments about WHY donating eggs (and also sperm) is important. I was pretty shocked to realize that in France we basically know nothing about these kinds of donation and there's a very serious lack of donors, so I would really like to advertise this possibility and stress the need for it. In France it's anonymous (so it means helping complete strangers) and donors are not paid, so I guess it doesn't leave much incentive to do it... But if I have stories to tell, or statistics, or anything I couldn't think about by myself, maybe I'll manage to make a little difference! It doesn't matter if whatever info you could give me is not about the situation in France, it's an universal problem anyway. 

Another little question: is there a sub for egg donors? I couldn't find one. I have a few more questions that I don't think my doctor could answer, mostly about the feelings of everyone involved.

I graduated from a TFAB lurker and still-trying occasional poster (old account) pretty quickly.  The information on this sub was invaluable and motivated me to seek out a RE early and take a hard look at my results. 

My husband and I have been trying for less than a year (since March), but I was motivated to do some initial testing with a RE after six months. Our initial diagnosis was a poor, but not abysmal SA for my husband and low-normal AMH for me (1.7). Since my AMH was low for my age and I have had very long cycles (but no PCOS) my RE offered (3) rounds of medicated IUIs. I asked her if I needed to do a HSG before that and she said no since there were no risks in my history. And I have to say, I really have no regrets about that. It was a three month delay to know what I know now, but my results are seemingly so rare (1-5% of population on the uterine finding) the practice really wouldn't mandate a HSG before this option. Also neither finding 100% impacts pregnancy rates, but one would theoretically make me potentially high-risk in OB. 

I had a HSG last Tuesday as protocol before moving on to IVF. My results are what appears to be a partially dilated left tube (causes unknown - no history of PID, abdominal surgery, etc) as well as a subseptate uterine configuration. The size of the septum is unknown at this time, but it doesn't appear (at least today) to be a full septum or bicornuate. I'm waiting to hear back from their MFM doctor that does 3D ultrasounds. I've been working thru the stages of grief about these findings, but in my RE's own words 'the sooner I accept these findings, the better I will be.' I believe in her. 

My question is about the partially dilated tube. My RE is not completely convinced that it's 100% blocked, but there was no dye spill on the test. There's no apparent hydrosalpinx, but in the end it just might not be 'doing me any favors'. 

I'm going to meet with the RE after the 3D ultrasound to make a plan for next year. Basically do we do IVF before septum surgery and (hopefully) FET or vice-versa. And more importantly how do we decide to keep/remove the tube. It would mean a more invasive surgery (lap) and recovery time, but nothing crazy.

<p>For those that have come across any similar situation with HSG tubal findings I would appreciate your thoughts. And really just any thoughts in general are always awesome :) </p>

Has anyone else had something like this after a failed cycle?  This is actually my fourth failed/cancelled cycle (one ended in an m/c at 6 weeks).  Have all these failed cycles broken my uterus now too?  I keep googling Asherman's syndrome since I had a D&C after my m/c back in September.
