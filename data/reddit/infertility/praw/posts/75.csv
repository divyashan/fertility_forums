*quick point here, my insurance covered this semen analysis*

We finally get into seeing his Urologist and he explains how he wanted to rule out any hormone issues and repeat a semen analysis.

This was an in network doctor, and an in network lab we used, so this wasn’t the cause of the issue that followed.

I look through my insurance and ALL of my husbands Urology related have been denied.
I have not received the EOB yet, but I know it’s because the coding that was submitted.

My insurance has diagnostic coverage for infertility but not treatment.

These denied claims included the initial visit, the hormone panel, the semen analysis, and then the follow up appointment.

Without seeing a urologist and getting these tests done, how can we be denied for a diagnosis not covered? The whole point of seeing him and having these tests done was to see if it was in fact infertility or an underlying problem.

When I think of treatment, I think of what is done after a diagnosis is confirmed and any treatment that followed.

How do these claims not fall under diagnostic? Especially the blood tests? I am unable to comprehend how insurance could say that a blood test would be considered treatment.

So, now we are waiting for the practices billing department to get the denial back to see what exactly was denied about the coding and what could be changed.

To make things more stressful, my obgyn is having my bloodwork redone and that is because my old gynecologist did the blood work on the wrong day of my cycle. I want to say she did them a week after my period or so and my new obgyn stated that these should have been run on day 3.  And what does it say on my bloodwork paper? N97.9 (female infertility unspecified). So I spoke to the billing representative at the office after seeing this and explained my insurance will only cover diagnostic, it won’t cover treatment, and I even made sure to point out how my husbands bloodwork was just denied due to the diagnosis billed on the claim.
She told me to just run it through insurance anyways as she doesn’t see how the blood test wouldn’t be considered diagnostic and if it’s denied THEN she will speak to my obgyn on changing the coding.
I also have an ultrasound on the 14th to monitor this cycle of letrozole, and I’m dreading that getting denied too.... I’m honestly surprised when I picked up my prescription today that I didn’t have the technician just top it off that it wasn’t going to be covered due to the reason it was prescribed.

I’m at a loss, I feel like I’m being punished for trying to confirm in fact that there is true infertility issues that weren’t caused by underlying conditions. How could visits to rule out other factors just be billed as infertility treatment?

Its just kind of unfair that you seek help after a year of trying and since it’s been past that year mark you just get infertility put on record as a diagnosis automatically.

Our donors just got cleared for eligibility and just had a consultation to go over the process and finances. We are aiming for retrieval and transfer this summer.

Most of the people I know who have done IVF have done so with their own eggs so I'm having a hard time understanding if the estimates that we received are in the right range. Also, I'm not sure if we should go through with some of the tests (such as PGT). 

Here is a rough breakdown of the costs we were given (we are in California): 

IVF Cycle Fee: $14,000

Legal fees: $2,000

Sperm donor fee: $1,830 (screening tests, storage, etc).

Egg donor/recipient fees fees: $6,120 (screening tests, genetic counseling, etc).

Medications (donor + recipient): $5,800

Licensed Clinical Social Worker: $750

Pregnancy Monitoring: $590

Frozen Embryo Transfer: $1,750

PGT: $4,000

Total: $36,840 (without PGT $32,840) 

Does this sound about right? Is this the amount that other people paid for their donors?

&#x200B;

A few questions I have:

1. The egg donor is 36 with 2 kids. It's optional to do the PGT, since she's had kids and under 40, I'm not sure if we need to.  They were pretty aggressive about pushing PGT. Is PGT necessary?
2. For the egg donor and recipient, the clinic suggests we do a mammogram. We are both under 40 and I've been told that other places do not require this for people under 40. Is this necessary?
3. For the egg donor/recipient fee, they have $3,500 allocated to screening. The list includes, blood tests, hysteroscopy, mammogram. I think I can do this through my PCP so I can get it covered by my insurance. Anyone else do their hysteroscopy outside the fertility clinic? I have to check with my insurance to see if they will cover it. Also, the mammogram seems unnecessary (I hear that only people over 40 need a mammogram).

&#x200B;

I am still grieving our infertility but I feel like I need to start moving forward because our donors (family members) are in their mid-30's and we need to start the retrieval process soon.

13,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I decided to make a stand alone post because this seems a little long for the dailies.

Background: I'm on a forced break from medicated IUIs and perhaps this is giving me a little too much free time for research. I \[28F\] and my husband \[28M\] have been actively TTC for one year, before that we were not trying, not preventing for about a year. We are going to CCRM Denver. His SA came back normal, except for hyperviscous seminal fluid. Our RE was not super clear about whether that was conclusively the cause of our infertility and we are still officially unexplained. My tests have mostly come back normal. I have had a cyst on my right ovary every time I've had an ultrasound (Jan-April) that changes size. I do have the MTHFR gene mutation but my homocysteine levels are normal. Early bloodwork showed high estrogen but a later test showed normal estrogen and my first test was chalked up to a hormone-producing cyst.

In our first consultation our RE thought I might be a good candidate for endo because I have super heavy and painful periods, pain with intercourse, and painful BMs during my period. Because nothing showed up on my baseline ultrasound or my HSG he decided not to pursue the endo line of questioning. I have long suspected I had endo but no OBGYN has been particularly concerned with my symptoms. I am wondering if I should push for ReceptivaDX testing. On one hand, it is expensive and we are paying for everything out of pocket. But I would hate to do 2 more medicated IUIs and then move on to more unsuccessful IVFs if I do have endometriosis. What would you do in my position? Should I ask my RE for testing? Should I keep trying the medicated IUIs?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks so much for your input. Based on all your comments I reached out to my RE and asked to discuss my options with him. I also spoke with a family member who's in medical school who thought that the Receptiva wouldn't benefit me much and that I should just go ahead and ask for the surgery. I'll keep you all posted.

&#x200B;

Update: I saw my RE on Monday. He agrees that I probably do have endo but says that laparoscopic surgery is shown to only minimally increase chances of getting pregnant in women with mild or moderate endometriosis. He cited [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9227926). He said that if I had come to him 15 years ago he would have sent me to get the surgery right away, but now he likes to try IVF first (or in my case, 3 medicated IUIs, then IVF). Then after a failed round of IVF, he would look into it more. He said that laparoscopic surgery only really helps in cases where there is scarring that pulled the fallopian tube out of alignment with the ovary or when there is severe endometriosis. He did say that if I was interested in the surgery for pain management that was a totally different story, and I should pursue that. At this point my main concern is increasing my chances of getting pregnant, not pain management. 

Our RE said he very rarely uses Receptiva. He said that it's promising but the studies done on it have been too small. He said there were 15 people in the clinical trial. What I'm seeing [here](http://www.receptivadx.com/uploads/endometrial_bcl6.pdf) is 70 people, with 69 actually completing the trial. Despite this inconsistency, I'm inclined to agree with him. It is still an invasive procedure, it's expensive, and I would probably still need surgery if I did it. 

I went home and did some research and it seems that seems to disagree with my doctor's statements (links below). I'm conflicted because my RE has great success rates and seems very knowledgeable and competent. I love the clinic and all the nurses and technicians there. But he seems to really understate the benefits of the surgery in comparison to all the studies I have read (see links below). In the end, my husband and I have decided to try 2 more medicated IUIs and if those fail, we may go get a second opinion before moving on to IVF.

Cause, I have to imagine we've all had far far far more twandings than we could ever possibly want, and my experience today was a little......odd?

&#x200B;

For some reason it seemed most of the nurses weren't in the office yet at 6:30 this morning, and one of them had mentioned yesterday a ultrasound person (I'm assuming this lady was a traveling nurse?). Anyways, the typical scenario is I go into the room, they make sure my name and date of birth is correct on the monitor and then they leave. I undress waist down, hop into the chair made specifically for WNBA players (come on, nobody can be THAT tall!) and toss the paper napkin over myself. The nurse returns and usually places one hand on my thigh or knee and guides the twand within. If it is my doctor he always always says, ""would you like to insert it or should I?"" We joke, make conversation, laugh...whatever...while we both watch the screen and they point out anything of interest on the monitor. Once they're done, twand is removed, they pull the condom off and then say they'll see me up front. 

&#x200B;

Boom. Done.

&#x200B;

This morning was a bit....weird. The nurse called me back and it started out normal, and after a little jerky start with my name and dob she left and let me get my thang ready. She comes back, hits the button to lift the chair and then turns the monitor away from me. Then...and this is our concern, dude....she spread my labia with her fingers  before twanding. It totally caught me off guard because that has never ever happened before, and she definitely was NOT the kind of person I could've just said, ""Woah! Buy me lunch first!"" like I would to the other nurses, so I just kept quiet. After the complete silence she finishes but doesn't lower me....she says, ""I'm going to write up my report real quick"" and proceeds to take three minutes to type it up while I'm still three feet up and taking her picture.

They are not PGS tested and I’m a bit hesitant to do so. The eggs are from a 25 year old donor who had three biological children at the time of egg donation. My husband had an excellent SA. The doc also told me that during the previous miscarriage “all of my numbers were great.” </p>

<p>What would you guys recommend? And has anyone had an experience with AC embryos?</p>

Apologies in advance if I break any rules, I'm doing my best trying to wrap my head around the acronyms. 

I'm 43, 1 MC, just started IVF and I'm on my first cycle (I think?). I have ENDO (LAP 2x), Hashimoto's, Congenital FXI Deficiency, myomectomy scheduled in June for a baseball sized fibroid. The ER is supposed to be at the end of May so the CCS can be done during my recovery. I hope that somebody here can help me fill in some of the blanks because the lack of communication from my RE's office (CCRM) this early in the game has me really worried. Here's where I'm at:

We did the clomid challenge in February. In March the gave me a 3 month supply of BCP and said to start taking them on CD1, skipping the inactive pills. I've been bleeding ever since. I e-mailed my RE's office about it a couple of times and they said that breakthrough bleeding was normal when starting BCP. It's worse than breakthrough but OK, fine. Couple of weeks in, I get a call saying that the insurance company approved the cycle and that I needed to pay the $3500 for the CCS and then after that is paid then they will go ahead and figure out the calendar and drugs. OK, fine. I write a check. 

Couple more weeks go by and I'm still bleeding and I haven't heard anything from CCRM so I email the nurse and ask what's up with the drugs and what the overall process is (because up to now, we haven't even so much as gotten a pamphlet wth a basic outline of the steps invovled) and she says, well on CD1, give us a call and we'll put you on BCP for 14 days and... Hold. Up. I've been on them already for over a month? So she says, let me discuss with the doctor, you were supposed to call on CD1. I explain that I did, I'd been e-mailing about the bleeding for weeks and I explain this to her and remind her that she responded to some of the e-mails about it. She says she must have missed it in my file (along with the FXI). Back and forth for a couple more days and yesterday I finally get word that I should stop the BCP (today) and that in about 2 weeks I should get an OPK and let them know if I don't see a surge. I don't know what I'm supposed to do if I DO see one, but that's another issue.

Can anybody weigh in on this and tell me what they think is happening here? I feel like based on the blank calendar that they gave me, the timeline is off (she said 5 weeks from CD1 to ER). If today counts as CD1, then that places the ER on almost exactly the day of my surgery. Everybody seems so... indifferent. I'm the only one with any sense of urgency about all of this and unless I initiate the communication nothing is being done. Am I overreacting, or did somebody drop the ball here? I feel like we should have started the stims already.

This is my first post.  My wife and I are on our fertility treatment journey.  Last year we tried IVF but it didn’t work out.  The doctor suggested we try an egg donor due to my wife’s age and our limited budget.  At the time, my sperm analysis was all roses.  We proceeded to select and pay for an egg donor and today I went to the fertility clinic to provide my sperm.  *Plot twist*.  After that I visited my family doctor to discuss some medical results (which included a semen analysis and a testicular ultra sound) and he tells me that I have varicoceles and that this has significantly reduced my fertility.  I was very glad to hear that I was not dealing with something starting with ‘c’, but it has still thrown me for a bit of a loop.  I am not trying to diminish the varicoceles diagnosis, but a while back I was scared shitless that I was dealing with cancer.  So, now my semen will be heading out for ICSI implantation with the donor eggs (the fertility clinic has not suggested changes to this...yet).

Anyone here care to share their experiences?  Has the onset of varicoceles led some to use donor sperm?  Any ICSI successes?  From what I have read today, it seems like ICSI is a significant help/support to many with this diagnosis.  Anyway, I am a noob to this.  Any pro tips or knowledge drops are appreciated.

Is there anything you guys found helpful in the days leading up to retrieval?  My follicles currently are 15.8, 14, 12.3.  I’m told that anything between 18-22 mm is ideal. 

I’m on day 7 of stims and doctor said my ER might be as soon as Thursday.

I’m thinking about asking for a local anesthesia based on what I’ve read here , it seems like the recovery will be faster and with three follicles it won’t be painful?

As for recovery— from what I’ve read here it sounds like Gatorade, Netflix, and laxatives are helpful?

In case anyone is curious my protocol:

Day 1-7: 300 Gonal; 2 vials menopur

Hello, I just found this subreddit, and have never posted before, but was hoping to connect. I am hoping to hear others' experiences with POF. I was diagnosed with POF at age 22, a couple years ago, after a blood test with an FSH level of 109. I  had what I now know to be menopausal-like symptoms from the age of 17, but for years the doctors dismissed the irregular periods as a result of weight loss. I think they dismissed my concerns largely due to my age and the fact that I have anxiety - they didn't believe I was having hot flashes. To be fair, I also didn't advocate for myself the way I am now, and took them at their word when they said everything was fine.

They recently tested for egg viability to see if they could freeze any, but it was determined that there weren't enough/any good eggs left to be frozen.  It seems everyone my age takes the possibility of having kids for granted, and now I know for sure I won't be able to conceive. I am really heartbroken about it. I am close with my friends, but feel like I am suddenly hiding a huge piece of my life.  I go to university and pretend everything's fine, and my friends are talking about preventing pregnancies or thinking of a good age to have kids or thinking of how many kids they want. And I just stay quiet. It feels so hard to even bring it up to other people.

The doctors are saying my options are to adopt or have a surrogate that conceives and carries the baby with a future partner. For anyone with POF, do you see fertility treatments as a possibility for the future/present? I have been seeing a therapist to process it, but was hoping to connect with others who have POF/have had similar experiences with being diagnosed with infertility.

I know that this is kinda unrelated to infertility, but I was wondering if we could talk about treatments here too. What are others' experiences with hormone replacement therapy?

You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. 

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

The thing is, that is what he told me at my very first consultation. Before he had done anything more than look at my records. I made an appointment for a consultation when my OB/GYN offered me a Clomid prescription when there was little to no evidence to suggest I was having ovulation issues; I figured an RE would know more and at the very least I could get a second opinion, maybe even do more to reach a specific diagnosis. The OB/GYN had ordered an HSG. It was clear. We also did a semen analysis and everything looked OK. So after a year of peeing on strips to track ovulation, we knew what it wasn't. But the RE didn't seem concerned with finding out what it was. In fact, he specifically discouraged me from looking for an answer and acted like there just wasn't one to be found.

But I doubt that. Because then we went on to do an ultrasound where the guy makes comments on whether my uterine lining looks good. Oh, and then there was the progesterone test I did. And there's the mention he made that IUI could circumvent cervical mucus issues.

So that's at least three fucking things it could be, two of which there are definitely tests for. I thought we were doing science.

But, no. Let's just call it unexplained fertility. Shoulder shrugs are great coming from medical professionals who are draining your bank account of thousands of dollars.

I do realize that, at a certain point, knowing what's ""wrong"" doesn't help if it's not going to change the recommended course of treatment. I'm assuming that's where the doctor was coming from. Apparently, he was bound to get some of the aforementioned data as part of a monitored IUI anyway. If we're looking for expediency, it seems this was the way to go. 

But that priority, that perspective, does nothing to help me, the patient, in dealing with it. It does not make me feel heard to be indirectly told that my reason for seeking treatment is essentially misguided because it's not just about results. In fact, it makes me feel like the doctor assumes I'm too stupid to follow the treatment. It does not make me feel in control of or more comfortable with my body to essentially be asked to have blind hope with every treatment. It makes me feel like my doctor really has no interest in my specific case, and makes me suspect that he's more focused on his numbers or his income than his patients. 

And I can't help but think that if we had found something closer to a cause than ""unexplained infertility"" he would have had an especially angry woman on his hands. 

Also, on a loosely related note: what kind of idiot thinks the best decorations for the waiting room of a clinic completely dedicated to treating infertility are giant pictures of babies and quotes about the joy of motherhood? That isn't hopeful or uplifting or comforting; it's painfully prodding an emotional bruise for every single person who goes in there, because literally no one who isn't having difficulty would be there.

Hubby and I have been TTC for over 2 years now with not even a sniff of a positive. I've been very resistant to going for fertility tests as I suffer from bipolar and I have been met with varying opinions on whether or not people with bipolar should have children (a whole other rant I won't go into!!)

I finally decided enough was enough and I booked my first appointment to get the ball rolling yesterday. Unfortunately I work a job where my shifts are never the same each week so it took me and the receptionist a while to find an appointment that coincided with my days off. Appointment booked and confirmed for 9:50am on 8th May. Yay!!

I get my shifts emailed to me and this evening I saw an email so clicked on it. It was for a different store that I have done maybe 3 shifts at to help out in the 14 months I've worked for my company. It showed I was on the Rota for Wednesday 8th from 7:30am to 4pm!!!

Immediately texted my boss to say I can't work this shift due to doctors appointment and that I can work the afternoon part if they need me. Bare in mind that this is NOT my store, I am not obligated to work there as part of my contract and I was not asked to do this shift before being put on the Rota.

I swiftly got a message back telling me that I have other days off I can change my appointment to (nope, receptionist and I went through all days and this was the only one in the next few weeks) and that I need to speak to the boss of the other store but she probably can't change it either. Also my boss does not know when other boss is working so I can talk to her.

So it looks like I'm either going to have to fight my boss and the other boss for this day off or cancel my appointment until I can work out when I'm next free to see the specialist.

109,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey everyone.  I’m hoping this is the correct place for this, and makes sense... if not I apologize.
Here we go:
I just finished up my second cycle of gonal-f with IC and progesterone and got an hcg of only 5.9 three weeks ago. Then over 48hrs went down to 5.7, and 48hrs after that down to 5.0.   I then got a very heavy, painful period.. We figured chemical pregnancy/early miscarriage, and deemed not viable.   But then this Thursday hcg went up to 24 , which concerned the doctor... today it is down again at 18.  I have no symptoms of pregnancy or pain/bleeding otherwise.

My RE is concerned it could be an ectopic or just hormones messing around.  He wouldn’t lean in one direction 

My problem is that  in late March we had made the decision to take a break after all this miscarriage stuff...  and booked a trip to go to a family wedding in Mexico,  knowing we would discontinue fertility treatments for 3-6 months due to Zika.  The trip is booked and we are supposed to leave Monday morning at 5am.  
However, now RE is advising that unless hcg is 0, we should completely cancel the trip and continue being monitored until hcg is 0.  This seems rather drastic to me considering hcg is going down (slowly) and is very low in the first place

I guess my question is, knowing that hcg is super low, and going lower again after this blip... should I cancel and wait around to watch it go down (which can take months to get to 0, as I’ve experienced in the past) or just go to Mexico and return to be monitored in a week.  Or should I be cautious of the small chance of an ectopic and cancel the trip?  It’s such a low chance! I’m so confused!!!  Is the doctor advising this way just to cover himself and not be liable if something where to happen if I left? 

I should also note I had a previous ectopic (lost a tube) 2yrs ago, and it took over 3wks until it was confirmed and had the surgery, and my hcg was over 13000 at that point. Will one week of monitoring really make a difference if this is what’s happening again?  How likely is it that I am in danger here with hcg this low? Am I being completely stupid wanting to still go on vacation !?!? 

Also, I have a history of 3 chemical/early miscarriages, and an ectopic (lost a tube) over the past 2.5yrs.  

I am devastated. I am exhausted.  I just want to go on this vacation with my family and go to this important wedding. Any advise or support/information would be greatly appreciated. TIA

113,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I was just benched for a month and a half for cysts and put on birth control. This is my first cycle back. We're unexplained and OOP so I want to save our money for IVF instead of doing a ton of IUI cycles since our chances of concieving with both IUI and TI is about the same. We decided to give IUI at least one shot though, and it was supposed to be this cycle. 
I did clomid 100mg cd 3-7, then gonal f 100mg CD 8 onward. Then the plan was ovidril and then the IUI. 

Cd 10 I went for my first follicle scan I didn't have anything measurable (everything under 10). I usually have at least a 15mm by now. My antral follicle count was 20 which is my normal average, but my estrogen was only 11 on CD2 which is waaay lower than my usual. My re doesnt know why or seem concerned. I have concerns that I'm over-surpressed from the birth control. But RE wants me to do the same dose of gonal and then come back in in 3 days. CD 13 (today): scan showed a 10mm and 11mm on my right ovary, and a 13mm on my left. Lining was only 4mm and no pattern. 

My RE wants me to trigger the day after tomorrow, and then have the IUI with no more scans. We cant afford to throw away a couple thousand on a doomed IUI, and I want to make sure that the cycle we do the IUI on is a good one since we only want to try it once it twice. If I trigger on Monday, that means that the follicles will only be 14, 15, and 17 and that's only if they grow the Top average of 2mm per day. .my lining is also nowhere near ready. But they won't do another ultrasound. so I told them I don't want to do the IUI, and we'll proceed with just TI. I'm hesitant to trigger Monday. If I don't trigger, will I ovulate on my own? I'm supposed to continue the gonal f until I trigger. I know not triggering puts me at risk for cysts but to be honest Im probably going to have them whether I trigger or not because i usually do. If I wait until they're ready and ovulate on my own, at least I'll have a shot. If I trigger too early there's no chance of anything. I'm pissed because I feel like my doctor is half-assing this. Im willing to drive the hours to the hospital and pay their price for the ultrasound so what does it hurt them to just do another one?

This is my first cycle back. We&#39;re unexplained and OOP so I want to save our money for IVF instead of doing a ton of IUI cycles since our chances of concieving with both IUI and TI is about the same. We decided to give IUI at least one shot though, and it was supposed to be this cycle. 
I did clomid 100mg cd 3-7, then gonal f 100mg CD 8 onward. Then the plan was ovidril and then the IUI. </p>

<p>Cd 10 I went for my first follicle scan I didn&#39;t have anything measurable (everything under 10). I usually have at least a 15mm by now. My antral follicle count was 20 which is my normal average, but my estrogen was only 11 on CD2 which is waaay lower than my usual. My re doesnt know why or seem concerned. I have concerns that I&#39;m over-surpressed from the birth control. But RE wants me to do the same dose of gonal and then come back in in 3 days. CD 13 (today): scan showed a 10mm and 11mm on my right ovary, and a 13mm on my left. Lining was only 4mm and no pattern. </p>

<p>My RE wants me to trigger the day after tomorrow, and then have the IUI with no more scans. We cant afford to throw away a couple thousand on a doomed IUI, and I want to make sure that the cycle we do the IUI on is a good one since we only want to try it once it twice. If I trigger on Monday, that means that the follicles will only be 14, 15, and 17 and that&#39;s only if they grow the Top average of 2mm per day. .my lining is also nowhere near ready. But they won&#39;t do another ultrasound. so I told them I don&#39;t want to do the IUI, and we&#39;ll proceed with just TI. I&#39;m hesitant to trigger Monday. If I don&#39;t trigger, will I ovulate on my own? I&#39;m supposed to continue the gonal f until I trigger. I know not triggering puts me at risk for cysts but to be honest Im probably going to have them whether I trigger or not because i usually do. If I wait until they&#39;re ready and ovulate on my own, at least I&#39;ll have a shot. If I trigger too early there&#39;s no chance of anything. I&#39;m pissed because I feel like my doctor is half-assing this. Im willing to drive the hours to the hospital and pay their price for the ultrasound so what does it hurt them to just do another one? Trigger Monday feels way premature especially when we don&#39;t even know what is going on in there. Am I overreacting?</p>

*WARNING: Long Post*


Here’s my story from the beginning. After trying naturally for 9 months with failure, our first baby was conceived via our first round of IVF + ICSI + PGS 3 years ago. We had unexplained infertility at the time.   (Although husband had low morphology (2%) with normal motility and count, and I had a small polyp that wasn’t removed as RE said that shouldn’t affect fertility, normal FSH levels, AMH was only 1.3 which the RE said was borderline low for my age (33) at the time but again not definitive for cause of infertility.) I never felt right about my UI diagnosis so during this second round of trying for our second baby, I pushed for more testing. I finally had the polyp (2cm) removed. So far we’ve done 4 cycles of unmediated TI-failed with maybe 1 possible chemical. 2 cycles of letrozole + trigger+ IUI- worked both times but both early miscarriage (at 6 weeks) and a chemical. So far, normal HSG, saline sonogram, better AMH (2.4), normal FSH. Husband sperm now is normal count 21-25M/ml, 8% morphology, 40% motility, 9% DNA frag but he got tested with low testosterone and was put on clomid. We know we can get pregnant but for some reason can’t keep them without ART + PGS. I had one unmediated monitored cycle that showed poor follicle development (12mm follicle in CD 16 and ovulated on CD18). RPL panel + karyotypes  were normal. Miscarriage with D&C was not genetically tested as it was considered my first. Finally got a hit with a positive Receptiva test. BCL-6 score of 2.0.

No symptoms of endo, had some painful periods but were controlled with OTC meds, a few years of birth control (not intentionally for the pain), and in my 30s, it wasn’t bad with just a heating pad. We were blindsided as this being the cause of our difficulties. RE could not tell us how bad the endo may be relative to my score as he said most patients there just get the Lupron and continue treatment.

My name is Lauren Sundheimer. I am a Reproductive Endocrinologist and Infertility Physician in Los Angeles with Southern California Reproductive Center -- SCRC. I work in a solo office in Torrance, CA but have the backup of a large group with a great lab in Beverly Hills. I like to think I get to practice the best of both worlds: the small intimate feel of a small practice where I get to develop close relationships with my patients, but with a big, well-oiled lab which prides itself on having superb success rates.

I'm here with my husband, Marco Fossati-Bellani - u/RE_hubby \- who is an Emergency Department physician. He's mostly here to guide me through reddit :)

I have no conflicts of interests to disclose.

Our website is [https://www.scrcivf.com/](https://www.scrcivf.com/)

While I will do my best to answer specific questions about your path to fertility, please understand that it is difficult to give detailed answered without your complete medical/surgical history. That said, I do phone consultations as well, and I am happy to provide detailed guidance. If you would like to schedule with me in person or on the phone, please contact 424-299-4551.  You can always private message me on reddit as well and I can coordinate with you directly.

I am unexpectedly assisting in a surgery at 11am PDT, so I may not get to your questions right away and I will be absent for a chunk of the day, but I will be back this afternoon, evening, and weekend to make sure I get to everyone!

Edit: Oh, I forgot!!

Edit #2: I'm off to surgery! I'll take a look this evening. Thank you all for your questions. Feel free to reach out via reddit, insta, facebook, or scheduling a call or visit.

Edit #3: I'm all done for the evening. I hope I got to everyone! Fertility management is (as you all know) complex and personal, and it is should be a two way street with your doctor. If you feel like you aren't being heard - let your doctor know. And if that doesn't work, find someone who listens!

129,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"As you probably read in the news, the United States is experiencing a major measles outbreak. You should ask your provider if they tested your immunity to measles. Even if you got the vaccine as a child you may have lost your immunity to measles, mumps and/or rubella. This check is especially important if you were born before 1989. Before 1989 there was only one dose, not two, of the MMR vaccine, so your potential for lost immunity is higher. If you are on break from treatment or prepping for a FET or ER at a later point now is the ideal time to get MMR if you need it because you must wait 28 days after the vaccine before getting pregnant. 

I just got a MMR vaccine today. Athough I still had rubella and mumps immunity I had lost my immunity to measles. (All three things are given as one shot. You can't get them separately, so I definitely had the vaccine as a child.)

Obviously, it would be a nightmare if there was a measles outbreak in your RE's waiting room, so you may want to ask your clinic what they are doing to prevent that from happening. My clinic is testing everyone and requiring vaccines for those who test as not immune. 

And a heads up: If you need the vaccine you'll go to a regular doctor or a pharmacy to get the vaccine, and be prepared for some really upsetting questions. My nurse practitioner today almost didn't give me my shot because I hadn't had my period yet even though my beta Wednesday after a failed FET was negative. Then she wanted me to assure her I would be on birth control for 28 days. I'm starting an egg retrieval cycle next month with frozen transfer after that, placing me well outside the 28 day rule, but she continued to question me. She even asked if I could take a urine pregnancy test for her, which made me cry. I assured her my reproductive endocrinologist would not have suggested I get the vaccine now if it wasn't safe. Anyway, just be prepared for some insensitive questions from the person giving the vaccine. 

I hope this meets the standards for a stand-alone. It seemed like it would reach more people this way. But forgive me if I should have put this in the daily chat.

Since it has come up twice in the last week, and others have also asked for resources, I thought it might be helpful to have a post that had everything together.

I'll add a few disclaimers:

\-  I think that choosing to use donor gametes is intensely personal, so what has been helpful for me may not be helpful for you. I'm learning about the donor conception world more and more all the time.

\- I am a female, in a male/female couple, using donor sperm.  I tried to note how inclusive (or not) some of these resources are, and many are, but since this is my personal research for my circumstances, there is that bias in the readings.

\- Some of these resources are ""parenting"" books or childrens books, things that were immensely helpful in my personal experience at finding peace with the use of donor gametes, though there were also a lot of challenging emotions tied up in reading parenting books and childrens books. For us, the childrens books were helpful in understanding what language we could use, and thinking about how we could fit it in to our life. So just a warning both to maybe not read this post further if that may be upsetting to you in general, and to take care of yourself if you start reading these books as it can be emotionally heavy.

\- We haven't even started treatment yet, let alone had a baby, so the usefulness of these resources for anything other than preparing has not been tested...

&#x200B;

Books for intended parents:

\- Three Makes Baby (Jana Rupnow) - this book was a quick read and gave a great overview of how to think about planning for and raising a donor conceived child, it is applicable for egg/sperm/embryo/same sex couples/different sex couples/I believe they covered single parents by choice as well

\- Random Families (Rosanna Hertz & Margaret K Nelson) - about donor sibling networks, I have not read all of it and find it emotionally overwhelming, but it is well written and raises very interesting points

\- Your Future Family: The Essential Guide to Assisted Reproduction -this actually comes out next week and I preordered so I will update when I read it

Children's Books:

\- Hope & Will Have a  baby: The Gift of Sperm Donation (Irene Celcer) - they do have egg and I think embryo donation as well but all versions are specific to different sex couples, it was only available on kindle but I read it on my ipad and it was formatted well

\- You were Meant to be (Sherry Keen) - covers both sperm and egg donation, is specific to different sex couples- Families come in Many Forms (Bella Mei Wong) - covers many different types of families (single mom with sperm donor, step parents, two moms with donor sperm, grandparents, mom/dad/biological child, two dads with a surrogate, adoption, mom/dad/egg donor)

\- You were Made for me (Sheri Surniolo) - This is one of my favorites.  It covers egg and sperm donation (could also likely work for double donor/embryo donor), it is specific to different sex couples though- The Pea that Was Me (Kimberly Kluger- Bell) - I have the sperm donation story, and the pea that was me&me&me versions.  Love them both.  Also available in two mom sperm donation, single mom sperm donation, surrogacy (called the very kind koala), IVF (I'm assuming this is with intended parent gametes?), two dad's egg donation and surrogacy, and single mom's sperm and egg donation

\- Making Violet: A Sperm Donor Story (Erin Devore) - very specific to their individual story which includes the dad having cystic fibrosis, I did not love how they talked about known vs anonymous donors without room for open ID donors.

\- Your Family: A Donor Kid's Story (Wendy Kramer) - had some good language but emphasizes the importance of the donor in a way that I do not intend on doing (aka calls the donor a biological parent, personally I will not use that language, but I know that many people do)

\- We're Different, We're the Same (Bobbi Kates) - Not a donor conception book, but a nice book for showing that even though we have differences in appearance, there are a lot of similarities in us all.

&#x200B;

Podcasts:

\- The Fertility Podcast - episode 168 is with Jana Rupnow the author three makes baby

\- Beat Infertility - bonus episode 115 is about how to tell your child (and others) how they came in to your life

\- Soul Mind & Body - episode 39 is with Sarah Fain (from the Happier in Hollywood Podcast) who is a choice mom, and gives a great view of starting a family in a way different than you originally thought you would  
\- Half of Me Podcast - Podcast host is in her late 20's (I think) and just found out she was sperm donor conceived this winter, gives a really interesting viewpoint of the experience

I'd love to know what other resources people have found helpful as well.

 It's extraordinarily expensive and can take years and years. You have to be 30 to even get on a lot of waiting list. There are 36 couples for every baby in the United States and a lot of sad stories of foster children being returned to their biological families after bonding with their adoptive parents. International adoption requires huge amounts of money and resources. And politicians using children as pawns certainly haven't made things easier.

 The system desperately needs to change and adoption needs to be more accessible. If it were that easy I would have adopted by now. Adoption is it's own struggle of waiting and hoping. It is it's own journey and not some easy fall back. So shut the fuck up, you have no idea what you're talking about. And when I make the mistake of telling someone about my struggles with fertility they give me some holier-than-thou bullshit about how there are so many children in the world who are unwanted and they would want to help them instead. Well I would like to also.

 Do you think I'm some selfish asshole who doesn't care about orphans? Is insurance covering adoption? Are you going to pay for my lawyer? Do you have any fucking idea about what kind of difficult process it is?  

Mind you that I have never heard parents who have adopted talk about adoption as an easy choice. These parents have been through so much to be with their children and would never minimize adoption in that way. In my experience this has then my single friends who have no idea what the fuck they're talking about.

Excuse me for my tone but I just got my period and then received a baby announcement in the mail from my friend who told me my miscarriage "" happened for a reason. Because it wasn't the right time.""

&#x200B;

I'm 3 IUIs deep (will test again tomorrow for my current cycle, but I got a negative on a FRER yesterday so I'm not optimistic despite my ongoing breast tenderness- fuck you, Clomid) and I'm trying to weight next steps. I've never tried to get pregnant before these three IUIs, and for the first two I'm almost certain we didn't get the timing right and inseminated too early. That said, donor sperm is very expensive, and the emotional cost of doing this on my own has turned out to be higher than I thought, too. I initially said I'd do 5 IUIs, considering I've never tried naturally, but I'm wondering if I have two more in me, and also wondering how much I'll hate myself if they don't work. I do think there's a chance they'll work still- I'm 35 and do ovulate regularly, but obv there's a lot that needs to line up for IUIs, especially with frozen sperm, and they don't give us any info as to why they fail.

&#x200B;

With my very low AMH (.37 a year ago), my RE has said to have minimal expectations for IVF. A 2nd opinion reiterated this. I did a consult with CNY since that's probably the only IVF I can afford anyway (no insurance coverage, I'm a social worker), and they were the most optimistic, but recommended to start priming with HGH right away. As a travel patient, one cycle with CNY would probably cost me 8-9k including meds. I'm pretty much only willing to do it once. The thing I'm thinking about, though, is that I could get two donor embryos locally for 8k, including transfer. $500 for meds. I looked through the donor database last night and the only issue is my ""favorite"" embryos were from a 34yo woman. I'm only 35! Is it worth spending 8k on a non-PGS tested embryo from a woman possibly only a few months younger than me? I do know she had a successful pregnancy from other embryos that cycle.

&#x200B;

I'm really asking myself right now if I want a baby that's genetically mine, or if I want a take home baby ASAP. There's part of me saying I feel like it's too early to give up on my own body, but another part of me says I just want to be a mom sooner than later, genes be damned.

&#x200B;

Male factor infertility is on the rise. New tools are needed. ZyMōt™ Sperm Separation Devices introduce a new method for delivering the best performing sperm for use in ICSI, IUI and IVF procedures.

ZyMōt ICSI and ZyMōt Multi Sperm Separation Devices simulate the cervical and uterine pathways that sperm must navigate to naturally fertilize an egg. By mimicking a process that has been preserved in nature for millions of years, ZyMōt Devices make it possible to separate the healthiest, best-performing sperm for use in ART procedures, without the use of sperm-damaging chemicals or centrifugation.

I understand they have phone or in person consults, both with different wait times. And as I’m understanding there is a consult fee in person but the consult over the phone is free?

What is the cost of a consult in person?

I live an hour away and have eaten up a lot of my time off already diagnosing our infertility issue. So that’s 2 hour round trip and then 30-60 minutes consult. So I would have to most likely aim for an appt when they open in order me to only have to miss half a day.

IVF Explained here. 

This is my 3rd AMA and as usual i am answering all things IVF from the perspective of the Lab and what happens inside. Most of you do not get much time to talk with us and likely have many questions about what goes on.

We have just released a brand new website - [ivfexplained.info](https://ivfexplained.info) which has lots of extra videos and posts about all things IVF. There is also a link that will allow you to get in touch with us should you wish to discuss things further in a Consultation setting. 

Many of you are asking where i am based, I am in San Francisco.

We also have many new features to the website coming up in the next few weeks such as live Q and A, live posts and a community forum to help you engage more with us

I hope you all learn something new today!

We are Dr. Jason Yeh ([/u/jasonyehmd](https://www.reddit.com/u/jasonyehmd)) and Dr. Kenan Omurtag ([/u/kro83a](https://www.reddit.com/u/kro83a)), two dual board certified obstetrician gynecologists and reproductive endocrinologists who take care of patients who are struggling with fertility or miscarriage.

Our typical day consists of minor/major surgery cases, diagnostic testing, and procedures such as intrauterine insemination all the way to in vitro fertilization egg retrievals and embryo transfers. Our practice experience is 18 years combined and includes polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), unexplained infertility, male infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, third party reproduction (egg donation, sperm donation, gestational surrogacy), basic infertility treatments (ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination), and advanced fertility treatments (in vitro fertilization, preimplantation genetic testing/diagnosis, comprehensive chromosome screening).

Ask us anything about: fertility, elective egg freezing, ovarian health, sperm counts, polycystic ovarian syndrome, disorders of sexual development, or our medical training, etc!

Hello. I am a psychiatrist and a novelist. I am a professor in the University of Michigan Department of Psychiatry and a member of its Depression Center. My special interests are mind-body interrelationships, and psychological aspects of women’s encounters with fertility and pregnancy issues. I wrote the first scientific articles on the response of women in labor to the use of the fetal monitor. I also published a comprehensive study of women with pseudocyesis (false pregnancy). In addition, I write regularly for Psychology Today on my Expert’s blog “On Call”. Many of these articles are about infertility and miscarriage. Here are several that might be of interest to this group: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/call/201604/infertilitys-darkness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/call/201604/infertilitys-darkness) ; [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/call/201609/infertility-and-miscarriage-shame-and-stigma](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/call/201609/infertility-and-miscarriage-shame-and-stigma) ; [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/call/201610/pregnancy-loss-awareness-how-help-others](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/call/201610/pregnancy-loss-awareness-how-help-others) .

 I also wrote a novel: *The End of Miracles* to help educate the public about these issues. It is about a woman whose deep need to bear a child is sabotaged by infertility and a tragic late miscarriage. The novel is psychologically deep and intimate while being set in a story that is gripping and suspenseful. More information about the novel can be found at my website: [https://monicastarkmanauthor.com](https://monicastarkmanauthor.com/)

3 canceled cycles, 1 pregnancy from converted IUI MC@8 weeks. 3 egg retrieval’s with current clinic. All gonal f 225, menopur 150, prednisone, HGH, dual trigger. Cycle 1&2 EPP, natural start cycle 3.

Cycle 1- 6R, 4M, 3F, 3B frozen
Cycle 2- 4R, 2M, 2F, 1B frozen
Cycle 3- 3R, 2M, 2F, 2 day 3 transfer- negative

Went to a consult with CCRM, head spinning a bit, so much information. They would recommend EPP with patches opposed to estradiol which I used in the past. He believes I was getting too much estrogen which was causing my very slow/no response in the canceled cycles- He thinks patches deliver it more evenly. Similar antagonist protocol but with clomid I think (didn’t give me an exact protocol).

Freeze all, pgs test, bcp w/letrozole or orlissa to address endo (I’m anti depot lupron but he would prefer that) one month prior to FET. 

We also did karyotyping for mr beans and myself. His mother had some issues getting pregnant and my father had very low sperm count. My sister also has DOR (but became pregnant cycle one 🙄), so he’s curious to see if there’s any genetic issues. 

My current clinic was willing to try MDL for this upcoming cycle in attempts to switch things up. They generally don’t use estrogen patches or clomid in their protocols. We would do a fresh day 5 transfer because that’s what I would like. CCRM said absolutely no fresh transfer because of the endo, so I would reconsider this.

I basically need to decide tonight which clinic to go with. Financially it’s about a 5,000 difference which is a lot but not a deal breaker. I like my current RE, new RE seemed a little arrogant but given his success rate, rightly so. My only complaint with my current clinic is their use of the same protocol each time, new clinic has a lot of different protocols.

How did you break up with your RE?
Should I email my current RE and tell her that we met with this other RE? I don’t know the specifics of what protocol this RE would use so couldn’t even ask her to try it. I feel bad since I really do like her. I know it’s not personal but it feels it.

**TODAY - Monday, April 22, /u/DrAimeeEggWhisperer will be doing an AMA starting at 5:00pm PDT (8:00pm EDT)**

*Dr. Aimee will be here to answer your questions on personalized fertility care and talk about what that means to her. She is also taking questions about using technology to help people navigate the different solutions they should consider for their individual problems.*

**TOMORROW - Tuesday, April 23rd, Dr. Monica Starkman (/u/Monica-Starkman) will be doing an AMA starting at 6:30am PDT (9:30am EDT)** 

*Dr. Starkman is a psychiatrist and a novelist. She is a professor in the University of Michigan Department of Psychiatry and a member of its Depression Center. Her special interests are mind-body interrelationships, and psychological aspects of womens’ encounters with fertility and pregnancy issues. She writes regularly for Psychology Today on her Expert’s blog [“On Call”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/call), with many articles about infertility and miscarriage. Her novel, [The End of Miracles](https://monicastarkmanauthor.com), was written to help educate the public about these issues. It is about a woman whose deep need to bear a child is sabotaged by infertility and a tragic late miscarriage.* 

**TOMORROW - Tuesday, April 23rd, Dr. Jason Yeh (/u/jasonyehmd) will be teaming up with Dr. Kenan Omurtag (/u/kro83a) for an AMA at 1:00pm PDT (4:00pm EDT)** 

*Both physicians are board certified obstetrician gynecologists and reproductive endocrinologists who take care of all things related to pregnancy, infertility, and reproductive hormone issues. Our typical day consists of minor/major surgery cases, diagnostic testing, and procedures such as intrauterine insemination all the way to in vitro fertilization egg retrievals and embryo transfers. Our practice focus includes polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), unexplained infertility, male infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, third party reproduction (egg donation, sperm donation, gestational surrogacy), basic infertility treatments (ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination), and advanced fertility treatments (In vitro fertilization, preimplantation genetic testing/diagnosis, comprehensive chromosome screening).*

We are not at the point of IVF yet, but I'm curious about DHEA.

Should I just take what she said and trust it? Would it be a waste to take it for 10 days?

Welcome to the Infertility Results thread and discussion! You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. 

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

I confirmed with the lab that they used WHO 5th edition for their labs. With that in mind minimal acceptable total motile is 40% with 32% progressive, and 3% for morphology.

The urologist said when looking at the parameters as a whole that IUI is a real decent shot for our case, as we would still be looking at around a total of 29 million motile to work with all things considered.

Anyways, this may sound silly, but the doctor I am going to see, while he came very highly recommended, I have been also advised he is a no nonsense, straight to the point, and not the “type to put an arm around you” kind of guy.... with that said I am terrified to broach the subject that I would prefer to use Letrozole first before trying Clomid.

&#x200B;

I am looking for some advice on protocols to try/things to ask my RE at my appointment on Monday.

&#x200B;

A bit of background  -  as my flair says, I'm 36 and have a low AMH. Never been pregnant, TTC for 2 yrs. All tests came back normal, ERA came back receptive, NK cells 12%.

My husband's SA came back with mildly decreased numbers and morphology, fragmentation was ok. Our RE said he's not too worried but he's willing to do ICSI to make me feel better.

We discussed that I would like to have the option of having more than 1 child so we were trying to get a few PGS normals to transfer and then freeze what's left so we went straight into IVF.

&#x200B;

My **first cycle's protocol** was a long Lupron  - Stared with **BCP** for 6 days at the same time with **Lupron 0.10CC** (for 10 days), then added **Menopur 300IU, Zomacton 0.25 mg** and **dexamethasone 0.5mg**. ALso had me take DHEA in the beginning but stop when stims started. Only had 3 follicles growing on my left, right side has one small one. Stimmed for 11 days since they were slow to grow and then **triggered with HCG 10.000IU and Gonal F 300IU**. 

&#x200B;

They only retrieved 2 eggs on ER day - anesthesiologist had a very hard time finding a vein and I think I may have ovulated the 3rd one by the time they went in? Only one was mature so the did ICSI but it didn't fertilize.

&#x200B;

For the **second round** he wants to do microdose Lupron: start with **BCP** for 6 days and prime with **Androderm** patches for 8 days (overlapping). Then add **Dexamethasone 2x0.5mg.** Then stim for 8 or 9 days with low dose **Lupron 0.2CC 2xday, Menopur 450IU, Zomacton 0.25mg, Estrace 2mg 2xday.** Not sure what we'll trigger with this time as it's not written in my calendar yet.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any anecdata regarding successful protocols in similar cases? I worry that we're frying the eggs and wonder if I should have started with lower doses but we didn't want to waste time.

I saw this sub was for women and men dealing with infertility so I thought I would give it a go. My wife and I have been struggling to conceive for three years now. We have cycled through two OBs and two specialists. We have finally found one that believes in us. 
  My wife is a saint. She has PCOS and has gone through essentially every round of medication from letrozine and clomid to ovodrill and has even had her ovaries drilled. When they drilled her ovaries, she had over 150 cysts on her ovaries. 
   We have started our IVF journey, and I know it is going to be a long one. Yesterday was her last day of birth control, and we have been doing the daily shot of ovodrill. 
  This is geared more towards the women of the sub. As a husband, what can I do to help calm her and reassure her? I tell her what she means to me, I try to pick up and clean to surprise her (her love language is acts of service, but she seems to be pulling away some. She blames herself and has called herself a failure. I have repeatedly told her that she can’t control what her body does but I know the doubt is still there. I cannot even begin to fathom what each and every woman here feels. My heart aches for you all. Any pointers or help that you could suggest? 

Finally, I want to tell you all how brave and encouraging you all are. This shit sucks. You women pick yourself up each and every day, put a fake smile on, and do what needs to be done. Your resilience and heart inspire me. I want to let you know you are all on my mind and I want you to know how worthy of being happy each of you are. Each and every one of you are incredible. Thank you for all of the insight this sub has provided from medicines to emotional rollercoasters.

Edit: this has absolutely overwhelmed me. Thank you everyone so incredibly much!

Background is that my husband and I are pursuing IVF because I am at risk for Huntington's Disease. I stupidly thought this process wouldn't suck all the happiness from my life and thought IVF would be ""easy"". JK LOL I was so fucking wrong. First cycle was 33 eggs retrieved, 29 mature, 25 fertilized, 12 frozen embryos, only 1 PGS/PGD normal. We opted to do another cycle to bank additional embryos.



My first cycle my estrogen levels were over 9600 so I triggered with Lupron only. This time my around my estrogen was over 9700 and they had me dual trigger with Lupron and HCG. I questioned why they changed it and the nurse told me that's just what the doctor wanted. 44 eggs retrieved, 38 mature, 29 fertilized. So I'm thinking things should be good. Last cycle we we had 25 fertilized and ended up with 12 frozen embryos for PGD/PGS. But of course as soon as I start to feel a glimmer of hope there's something just waiting to crush me.



This cycle I end up in the ER in pain for OHSS, gained 10 pounds in a few days, look 4 months pregnant, and need IV fluid because my bloodwork is all over the place. My abdomen and lungs have fluid in them. OHSS sucks! Don't be stupid like me and think you're ok for a few days before admit to yourself you can't breath properly or get out of bed without severe pain.



Fast forward to today. My clinic makes you wait 8 days for your final embryo biopsy count. I should have received a call yesterday but by 3pm I heard nothing. I call my nurse line at 3:20 and they tell me they'll send the lab a message. I never received a day 8 call. This morning I call the nurse line again and say I need answers ASAP. The lab calls me and tells me only 5 embryos made it!! WTF???? 5/29 biopsied when the first time around I had 12/25?? The lab doesn't have any answers other than this stuff happens sometimes. I've requested to speak with my physician because this doesn't make sense. 



I want know:


1. Did the dual trigger fuck this up?


2. Did the lab fuck this up?


3. Or is there a fertility issue that's being ignored here because we're young, healthy, and pursuing IVF for PGD purposes?



It's so hard to talk to the doctor or lab at my clinic. I can only call a nurse line or coordinator and hope they convey my message across. I am so mad and so sad at the same time. I don't know if I should scream or cry or both. This is the worst fucking thing I've ever chosen to put myself through. Oh and I'm broke now because we're self pay.

288,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi there, hope this is allowed.  We had our first RE consultation today.  I’m 32 (33 in a couple months).  My husband is 35.  We have been trying since November 2016, and after initial semen analysis back from February 2018 being abnormal we just suspected it was male factor infertility.  It pained me because I’m much more the problem solver and checkbox checker of the two of us, so I wanted it to be something with me that I could fix.  Because of his journey and possible denial, it meant we weren’t in a great place to move forward with RE and treatments.  I tried to sweep it all under the rug and just hope we would get pregnant one day.  

Well, today we had our appointment with the RE.  As much as I prepped that I may get news about me, I have to say I wasn’t really ready for it.  At 32, I have FSH of 8.9, AMH of 1.92, and 8 antral follicles.  These were tested on day 3.

We had our first RE consultation today.  I’m 32 (33 in a couple months).  My husband is 35.  We have been trying since November 2016, and after initial semen analysis back from February 2018 being abnormal we just suspected it was male factor infertility.  It pained me because I’m much more the problem solver and checkbox checker of the two of us, so I wanted it to be something with me that I could fix.  Because of his journey and possible denial, it meant we weren’t in a great place to move forward with RE and treatments.  I tried to sweep it all under the rug and just hope we would get pregnant one day.  </p>

<p>Well, today we had our appointment with the RE.  As much as I prepped that I may get news about me, I have to say I wasn’t really ready for it.  At 32, I have FSH of 8.9, AMH of 1.92, and 8 antral follicles.  These were tested on day 3.

I’ve introduced myself on this sub before (I’m pretty sure, though it’s been awhile) and have been a silent reader almost daily. Decided to be a little more active just because I think I’m at a point where I do need any and every support and understanding possible. 

My husband (32M) and I (28F) have been trying for more than 3 years now. We’ve had 3 unsuccessful IUIs and IVF is our recommended next step. I’ve never had a positive pregnancy test EVER. I’m in therapy once a month thankfully with a therapist who specializes in infertility. 

We decided to wait on IVF because of the cost and also because I don’t think I’m mentally nor physically ready for it. I can’t justify paying more than $10,000 and going through an invasive procedure for a 50% chance just yet. Our recent brief research gave us more options though - CNY, or traveling to my home country since we go back every year, which will save us some money when we covert currencies. 

We belong in the Unexplained category. The only answers we have is 2% morphology on my husband’s first SA 2 years ago, low vitamin D levels for me (which I’m on a daily supplement for, if I remember to take it), and further testing past our 3rd IUI revealed elevated NK cells for me and high DNA fragmentation for my husband. The 2nd RE we consulted with doesn’t take the last 2 results into account due to insufficient medical evidence, which my husband is kinda on board with. 

This journey really sucks and I’m just so jaded with everyone else around being able to get pregnant and I can’t. Being Christian, I find myself struggling with faith too. With us waiting to do IVF, we’re back to square one trying on our own. If I belong more to r/stilltrying, please let me know!

I'm trying to find a doctor to speak to about uterine PRP injections.  I see a lot of ladies commenting on the studies of ovarian injections, but I'm looking for uterine experiences and info.  I had a myomectomy to remove fibroids (so I could carry a successful pregnancy, which I bet I would have done without the surgery that caused all this), which then caused Asherman's (because the powers that be hate me, a lot), and after seeing Dr Isaacson in Boston have been told that I have basically no normal endo tissue on the top of my uterus... the most important spot.

I'm doing that mostly out of curiosity to see what the lining I DO have does.  

My questions are:

1) How do I find a clinic that does these injections?  I'd like to talk to a doctor that does it and see if it's possibly worth pursuing.

2) If my lining doesn't grow at the top, but it does grow fine maybe mid or lower, I know placenta previa (I think) is a thing, but has anyone been in a similar situation and been able to carry successfully?

We realize the AM/PM distinction doesn't work for every timezone, just use the most recently posted one (you can sort the sub by ""new"" to find this easily).  It also helps tremendously if you upvote the daily threads when you see them so they stay at the top of the sub making them easier for others to find.

The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or treatment related questions.  It's a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help.

The Chat threads are for anything and everything not related to Active treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won't stop asking about when you're having kids? Funny story? Rant? These all go in the Chat thread. This is a great place to get to know fellow members outside of their treatment or diagnosis.   

Have a question that you think might warrant a standalone post or doesn't fit in the active/chat threads?  Try the FAQ/Wiki first!  https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index  We have archived posts covering getting started, what all those acronyms mean, what we wish we knew ahead of time, individual experiences with ALL the medications, treatment options, common protocols, procedures, paying for treatment, past AMA archives, hunger games data... there's a lot of information there!

Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. Questions phrased like ""has anyone else tried clomid?!"" are not generally well received.

There are AM &amp; PM threads for Active Treatment and Chat posted by the automod.  We realize the AM/PM distinction doesn&#39;t work for every timezone, just use the most recently posted one (you can sort the sub by &quot;new&quot; to find this easily).  It also helps tremendously if you upvote the daily threads when you see them so they stay at the top of the sub making them easier for others to find.</p>

<p>The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or treatment related questions.  It&#39;s a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help.</p>

<p>The Chat threads are for anything and everything not related to Active treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won&#39;t stop asking about when you&#39;re having kids? Funny story? Rant? These all go in the Chat thread. This is a great place to get to know fellow members outside of their treatment or diagnosis.   </p>

 We started our journey in November 2017 and tried timed intercourse until about September 2018. Nothing happened. So I went to my gynecologist. Thankfully he wanted to help and didn't push the whole ""try for a year first since you're young."" 

He sent for an ultrasound, which came back normal. Then we did an HSG. The doctor that performed it said it looked okay. One potentially blocked tube but the other was okay. 
My doctor had other ideas, to him they both looked blocked. So we scheduled an exploratory laparoscopy in the beginning of November. A 2 hour surgery turned into 4. They found Stage 4 endometriosis everywhere and a 7 cm teratoma. Both my tubes were done for, we had discussed the potential removal of both and I had given him permission to use his judgment while performing the laparoscopy. So he removed them both.

Even though I knew it was a possibility, I still felt like a failure. How could I not notice Stage 4 endometriosis?? Or a 7cm teratoma?? Who misses that?? But the truth is I had no symptoms. My periods were always normal and always on time. Looking back, I had a bit of urine incontinence that I blamed on gaining weight but might have endo affecting my bladder.

I had a really hard time coming to terms that I am infertile and I will never have the ""accidental"" pregnancy every other couple around me seems to be having.

We are in a rural area and the only IVF clinic is packed. Right now, it seems we won't be able to start our first cycle until mid June. I'm excited and scared and hate the waiting but it does give me time to stop eating my feelings!

I know this is a difficult and sensitive question. But how do you tell your partner that you no longer want to pursue fertility treatment on account of the time and financial investment?  


For a long time I had been lukewarm on having children but later wanted children.  Because of this, and out of love for my spouse, who is very ready to be a mother, we tried to have baby for 4 years. Then, we went through two rounds of IVF. Now, without insurance, we are considering a ""shared risk"" program, which would cost $20,000 USD if successful, plus medication as well as travel and accommodations in the US  (we live in Canada - I don't know of shared risk programs near us in Canada).  


At this point, I am of the view that we should allocate our hard-earned money to our lives -- travel, donating, friends, and so on. My spouse and I often squabble over financial goals, particularly when IVF comes up, because IVF will require years of savings, which means no house, no travel (without feeling guilty), and no ""spoiling"" ourselves (again, without feeling guilty about not using the money toward IVF). I'm willing to spend another $10,000 or so but that's about it. I feel like our views on this issue are so different that it could be the beginning of the end of our partnership.

336,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"About Me: Female, 29 as of this week, PCOS (diagnosed early 20s but never received further testing or treatment of course). At 5’8” and 155lbs, I’m not really overweight like many PCOS women but have some very stubborn belly fat that nothing seems to budge. 

Husband: Male, 32. Very healthy overall, but possible low morphology. 

History: We started “not trying/not preventing” in May 2016, and then earnestly trying by the end of 2016. My cycles were irregular and long - 40-65 days. I had a doctors appt with my PCP and one with my OB/GYN, both said I should be fine for pregnancy. I was doing all the usual things to be healthy - taking prenatals, eating well, exercise, lower stress, etc. 



By September 2017 I had moved and got a new OB/GYN. She said, “you’ve only really been trying since last December, so it’s not been a full year yet so your not officially dealing with infertility. Just keep trying!” Got nothing out of that appt. I went full steam ahead with vitamins, dietary tricks and natural supplements. Anything to get me to ovulate.

By next Spring, I had read Taking Charge of Your Fertility 3 times, I was temping, tracking, charting, etc. Temping was a failure, too all over the place results. I was using OPKs and never got a positive. Elevated LH was giving me the same results every day.

In June, I decided to work with a naturopath who specialized in women’s care, hormones, PCOS, etc. She offered to run a bunch of tests but they’d be out of pocket and she wasn’t convinced they were necessary anyways because she was quite sure I had PCOS and didn’t need more than that. After three appointments, she tried to get me to replace all my prenatals and supplements with her “higher quality” brand and I realized I was dealing with a salesmen and stopped working with her. 

The only advice I took from her was to use a 20mg dose of natural progesterone cream on cycle days 14-28. This actually appeared to be regulating my cycle and gave me cycles ranging from 28-32 days for the first time in years. 

By December 2018, I once again moved and this time I went straight to a fertility clinic. It is highly rated with solid success rates.

First thing the RE said was to stop using the progesterone cream and stop wasting my energy temping and using OPKs. She said for many women with PCOS these are useless, and I agree based on my experience.

She then ran a transvaginal ultrasound, 2 hormone panels and an HSG. 

She confirmed I do have PCOS. She ruled out Thyroid or anything else. They found uterine fibroids, benign and not considered to be affecting fertility at this time.

At 5’8” and 155lbs, I’m not really overweight like many PCOS women but have some very stubborn belly fat that nothing seems to budge. </p>

<p>Husband: Male, 32. Very healthy overall, but possible low morphology. </p>

<p>History: We started “not trying/not preventing” in May 2016, and then earnestly trying by the end of 2016. My cycles were irregular and long - 40-65 days. I had a doctors appt with my PCP and one with my OB/GYN, both said I should be fine for pregnancy. I was doing all the usual things to be healthy - taking prenatals, eating well, exercise, lower stress, etc. </p>

<p>By September 2017 I had moved and got a new OB/GYN. She said, “you’ve only really been trying since last December, so it’s not been a full year yet so your not officially dealing with infertility. Just keep trying!” Got nothing out of that appt. I went full steam ahead with vitamins, dietary tricks and natural supplements. Anything to get me to ovulate.</p>

<p>By next Spring, I had read Taking Charge of Your Fertility 3 times, I was temping, tracking, charting, etc. Temping was a failure, too all over the place results. I was using OPKs and never got a positive. Elevated LH was giving me the same results every day.</p>

<p>In June, I decided to work with a naturopath who specialized in women’s care, hormones, PCOS, etc. She offered to run a bunch of tests but they’d be out of pocket and she wasn’t convinced they were necessary anyways because she was quite sure I had PCOS and didn’t need more than that. After three appointments, she tried to get me to replace all my prenatals and supplements with her “higher quality” brand and I realized I was dealing with a salesmen and stopped working with her. </p>

<p>The only advice I took from her was to use a 20mg dose of natural progesterone cream on cycle days 14-28. This actually appeared to be regulating my cycle and gave me cycles ranging from 28-32 days for the first time in years. </p>

<p>By December 2018, I once again moved and this time I went straight to a fertility clinic. It is highly rated with solid success rates.</p>

<p>First thing the RE said was to stop using the progesterone cream and stop wasting my energy temping and using OPKs. She said for many women with PCOS these are useless, and I agree based on my experience.</p>

<p>She then ran a transvaginal ultrasound, 2 hormone panels and an HSG. </p>

<p>She confirmed I do have PCOS. She ruled out Thyroid or anything else. They found uterine fibroids, benign and not considered to be affecting fertility at this time.</p>

She's already had one of her ovaries removed and has just been diagnosed with Stage 4 (Extremely Severe) Endometriosis which means she has an abnormal amount of scar tissue which is starting to become web-like and attach itself to other organs. She also has numerous cysts all over her body. 

While the doctor said they'd do everything they could to preserve her last remaining ovarie, there's no guarantee they will be able to although my friend is optimistic. They're going to freeze her eggs as a precaution in case fertility continues to be elusive and IVF becomes necessary, although I've also told her that I'd be willing to be a surrogate for her as well if push comes to shove as she's family to me. 

She's had a very abusive childhood and has endured many verbal attacks from her family about how she's not even a woman if she can't get pregnant. It's been rough. Her greatest dream in life was to become a mother one day. However, it seems like that dream is becoming further and further away. Even if she does IVF, it'll be incredibly expensive. 

On top of the psychological pain, she's in pain pretty much every single day, especially with her menstrual cycle. It's causing her to have ache breakouts on her chin and grow abnormal facial hair. She's in pain when she has sex which probably also makes her feel (wrongly) invalidated as a woman. 

Are there any products that might provide relief for any of her symptoms?

**Background:**

My husband (36) and I (34) were diagnosed with infertility in fall 2017 (at ages 35 and 33), after 8 months of impeccably timed sex resulted in nothing – not even a CP. We were quickly diagnosed as unexplained, with *possible/borderline* DOR. My stats weren’t great, but also not awful (AFC = 8, AMH = 0.95, FSH = 12), and my then-RE offered the untestable hypothesis that my autoimmune diseases (ulcerative colitis and asymptomatic Hashimoto’s disease) had damaged my eggs. At the time our case was considered pretty straightforward, and we were offered IUI - but we ultimately decided to proceed with IVF for the purposes of embryo banking (ha!). (The [Fertilome genetic test](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8vo4k8/fertilome_results_pof_rpl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) later found that I have a moderately increased risk for Primary Ovarian Insufficiency, but we didn’t know that at the time – and so far I’m still ovulating.)

Throughout this process, we were very lucky to have some insurance coverage – insurance would cover up to 4 retrievals, but we would pay for all meds and transfers out of pocket. We had heard the advice that “IVF is often diagnostic,” so all along, our strategy has been to be as scientific as possible, in order to get as much information as we could out of the 4 chances that we were allotted.

&#x200B;

**Cycle 1, April 2018**

**ICSI, EPP antagonist protocol**

* **AFC =**  8
* **Protocol:** We started with 375/225 Gonal-F/Menopur, and then switched to 300/300 on day 6 due to slow follicle growth. We added Cetrotide on day 8, and triggered with HCG on day 12.
* We planned on ICSI because our insurance said they would cover it, and my RE assumed it would increase our chances of success (my more cynical side thinks they just wanted the extra insurance money).

|Cycle|Gametes|Fert. Plan|Eggs Retrieved|Mature|Fertilized|Day 3|Day 5 Still Growing|Day 5 Blasts|Day 6 Blasts|PGS Normal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|ET & Mr. ET|ICSI|7|5|1|1|1|0|0|0|

* **Results:** Our one embryo looked “perfect” on day 3, but growth slowed by day 5, and it degenerated on day 6, having never made it to blast.
* **What we learned:** The results of this cycle were really shocking, particularly because ICSI usually results in good fertilization rates. My RE suggested that this was evidence of poor egg quality, but the embryologist disagreed and said when ICSI fails due to egg quality, the eggs are visibly fragile – and mine were not fragile. Furthermore, she said that when embryos degrade in quality between days 3 and 5, this is often indicative of a sperm problem. We were left wondering if the problem was really my eggs, or if there was an undiagnosable genetic problem with my husband’s sperm, and that ICSI had overridden the natural selection that would otherwise take place.

&#x200B;

After Cycle 1, I also developed C Diff as a result of the 4 days of doxycycline that was prescribed after retrieval, and learned that I should never take it again. (Just thought I should include that, to fully document how stressful of a year this has been.)

&#x200B;

**Cycle 2, July 2018**

**ICSI/IVF split, EPP antagonist protocol with HGH, clomid, letrozole**

* **AFC =** 13
* **Protocol:** We switched to a new clinic that would prescribed HGH for egg quality. Protocol was HGH + 225/225 Gonal/Menopur, Clomid and Letrozole for first 5 days of stims, Cetrotide starting on day 8, dual HCG and Lupron trigger on day 12. We decided to fertilize some eggs with ICSI and some with standard IVF, to see if standard IVF resulted in better fertilization rates.

|Cycle|Gametes|Fert. Plan|Eggs Retrieved|Mature|Fertilized|Day 3|Day 5 Still Growing|Day 5 Blasts|Day 6 Blasts|PGS Normal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|ET & Mr. ET|ICSI|6|5|1|1|1|0|0|0|
|2|ET & Mr. ET|IVF|5||3|2|2|0|0|0|

* **Results:** We still technically had embryos on day 6, but the quality was way too poor to freeze, and it was too late to attempt a transfer.
* **What we learned:** There was a very clear difference here – we had a much higher fertilization rate with standard IVF than with ICSI. Although we didn’t know *why* standard IVF was better, and although nothing made it to good-quality blast, we wondered if this was our answer: maybe if we did standard IVF with enough eggs, we’d get a large number to fertilize, and 1 or 2 would make it to blast.

&#x200B;

**Cycle 3, October 2018**

**IVF, EPP antagonist protocol with HGH, clomid, letrozole**

* **AFC =** 15
* **Protocol:** Exactly the same as Cycle 2; 12 days of stims with Cetrotide starting day 8.

|Cycle|Gametes|Fert. Plan|Eggs Retrieved|Mature|Fertilized|Day 3|Day 5 Still Growing|Day 5 Blasts|Day 6 Blasts|PGS Normal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3|ET & Mr. ET|IVF|18||11|10|9|1|4|1|

* **Results:** The day 5 blast was aneuploid; of the day 6 blasts, 1 was euploid but had poor morphology (grade C-). That one was frozen.
* **What we learned:** This cycle confirmed that IVF was better than ICSI, but that there was still an underlying problem that wasn’t fixed by switching to 100% standard IVF. With the dramatic drop-off coming between days 3 and 6, we still didn’t have a consensus on whether the problem was caused by poor egg quality, poor sperm quality, or both. Our RE was pressuring us to either (a) transfer the poor quality blast, (b) keep doing retrievals with the same protocol, because “your retrieval numbers are the only thing you have going for you – and with enough eggs, there has to be a normal blast in there!” or (c) take a huge financial gamble on donor eggs, because that was “probably” our problem.

&#x200B;

At this point, my husband and I felt that it didn’t make any financial sense to continue. So far, 36 eggs had gotten us exactly 1 “normal” blast with poor morphology, which the embryologist thought wouldn’t survive the freeze/thaw. It would cost us $8k in meds for a 4th retrieval (not to mention the emotional and physical toll), and then we would be totally out of pocket for any additional retrievals, donor purchases, or transfers. But then we learned that my husband’s company was improving its insurance offerings for 2019: if we proceeded with a 4th and final retrieval, insurance would cover the cost of meds.

We decided to switch REs, and made an appointment with the clinic director, who is known for taking on difficult cases and thinking outside the box. We were very blunt with him about where we were at financially and emotionally, and told him that we were willing to do one more retrieval if it could provide us with definitive answers about whether there was any hope for us with ART, or whether we should instead pursue adoption. He suggested “The Nuclear Option.”

&#x200B;

**Cycle 4, March 2019: The Nuclear Option**

**Microdose Lupron + HGH**

**3-way split with my eggs, husband’s sperm, donor eggs, and donor sperm**

* **AFC =** 14
* **Protocol:** standard Microdose Lupron protocol + HGH; HCG trigger on day 10 (the goal was to stim me faster than my prior cycles; RE’s theory was that long stims were frying my eggs)

|Cycle|Gametes|Fert. Plan|Eggs Retrieved|Mature|Fertilized|Day 3|Day 5 Still Growing|Day 5 Blasts|Day 6 Blasts|PGS Normal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|4|ET & Mr. ET|IVF|10||8|8|7|0|4|1|
|4|ET & DonorS|IVF|5||5|5|4|0|1|1|
|4|DonorE & Mr. ET|ICSI|6|4|4|4|4|2|1|3|

* **Results:** My eggs had a dramatic drop-off between days 3 and 5; the donor eggs did not. The two day-5 blasts created with the donor eggs were PGS normal and grade B+. The one day-6 blast was PGS normal and grade C. All of the blasts created with my eggs were day-6 and grade C-. One of ""ours"" came back normal, and one mosaic. The donor sperm blast also came back normal, grade C.
* **What we learned:** As my RE summed it up, the differences between my eggs and the donor eggs were “profound,” proving once and for all that I have shitty egg quality. Although this was the initial hypothesis, seeing the results in black and white gave me, my husband, and our RE a sense of closure: we know that it’s definitely not worth it to keep doing retrievals. In addition, seeing that my husband’s sperm actually fared *better* than the donor sperm put many of our fears to rest, and reassured us that it would *not* be a waste of money to purchase additional donor eggs. Finally, as we prepare to transfer our poor quality embryos, we have the reassurance that if they fail to thaw, we have some healthy egg donor embryos waiting in the wings. There’s a good chance that I won’t have a completely canceled transfer; just a different embryo than I was hoping for. And no matter what happens, at this point we feel that we’ve truly tried everything, which brings its own sense of peace.

<ul>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The day 5 blast was aneuploid; of the day 6 blasts, 1 was euploid but had poor morphology (grade C-). That one was frozen.</li>
<li><strong>What we learned:</strong> This cycle confirmed that IVF was better than ICSI, but that there was still an underlying problem that wasn’t fixed by switching to 100% standard IVF. With the dramatic drop-off coming between days 3 and 6, we still didn’t have a consensus on whether the problem was caused by poor egg quality, poor sperm quality, or both. Our RE was pressuring us to either (a) transfer the poor quality blast, (b) keep doing retrievals with the same protocol, because “your retrieval numbers are the only thing you have going for you – and with enough eggs, there has to be a normal blast in there!” or (c) take a huge financial gamble on donor eggs, because that was “probably” our problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>At this point, my husband and I felt that it didn’t make any financial sense to continue. So far, 36 eggs had gotten us exactly 1 “normal” blast with poor morphology, which the embryologist thought wouldn’t survive the freeze/thaw. It would cost us $8k in meds for a 4th retrieval (not to mention the emotional and physical toll), and then we would be totally out of pocket for any additional retrievals, donor purchases, or transfers. But then we learned that my husband’s company was improving its insurance offerings for 2019: if we proceeded with a 4th and final retrieval, insurance would cover the cost of meds.</p>

<p>We decided to switch REs, and made an appointment with the clinic director, who is known for taking on difficult cases and thinking outside the box. We were very blunt with him about where we were at financially and emotionally, and told him that we were willing to do one more retrieval if it could provide us with definitive answers about whether there was any hope for us with ART, or whether we should instead pursue adoption. He suggested “The Nuclear Option.”</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Cycle 4, March 2019: The Nuclear Option</strong></p>

<p><strong>Microdose Lupron + HGH</strong></p>

<p><strong>3-way split with my eggs, husband’s sperm, donor eggs, and donor sperm</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AFC =</strong> 14</li>
<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> standard Microdose Lupron protocol + HGH; HCG trigger on day 10 (the goal was to stim me faster than my prior cycles; RE’s theory was that long stims were frying my eggs)</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> My eggs had a dramatic drop-off between days 3 and 5; the donor eggs did not. The two day-5 blasts created with the donor eggs were PGS normal and grade B+. The one day-6 blast was PGS normal and grade C. All of the blasts created with my eggs were day-6 and grade C-. One of &quot;ours&quot; came back normal, and one mosaic. The donor sperm blast also came back normal, grade C.</li>
<li><strong>What we learned:</strong> As my RE summed it up, the differences between my eggs and the donor eggs were “profound,” proving once and for all that I have shitty egg quality. Although this was the initial hypothesis, seeing the results in black and white gave me, my husband, and our RE a sense of closure: we know that it’s definitely not worth it to keep doing retrievals. In addition, seeing that my husband’s sperm actually fared <em>better</em> than the donor sperm put many of our fears to rest, and reassured us that it would <em>not</em> be a waste of money to purchase additional donor eggs. Finally, as we prepare to transfer our poor quality embryos, we have the reassurance that if they fail to thaw, we have some healthy egg donor embryos waiting in the wings. There’s a good chance that I won’t have a completely canceled transfer; just a different embryo than I was hoping for. And no matter what happens, at this point we feel that we’ve truly tried everything, which brings its own sense of peace.</li>
