CD 10 and I have a 16mm and 13mm on the left, two 12mm on the right. I've been given two more vials of Menopur to try to grow those two on the right before Wednesday.

The problem is my left tube might be blocked. Original RE said the HSG was inconclusive about the left side (right is fine). New RE says it's definitely blocked. Which would be fine except I magically got pregnant earlier this year with the dominant  (seriously - it was a monster) follicle on the left. So maybe not so blocked, you know?

If those follicles on the right don't catch up, they'll cancel the cycle. I can override them and do the IUIs (back to back) anyway - they just cancel to save money. Normally we'd do timed intercourse if they cancelled, but of course my husband will be out of town. We've already paid for and frozen two vials for these IUIs.

If we cancelled this cycle, we'd be out upwards of $1600. Next cycle we'd double our chances by using the frozen for IUIs and doing TI, but we'd have to pay that $1600+ for meds and ultrasound again.

The discomfort, extreme pain, and fear that I've experienced during OHSS has honestly been really overwhelming to me, way more emotional than the stims/ER or dealing with my husbands recovery from sperm aspiration surgery. I feel like my body is out of my control, and it's been terrifying. I'm sort of scared to try to get pregnant now. The past 3 days have been a nightmare and in the scheme of what I'd go through pregnant, this is nothing, right?

***Update***

Just wanted to post an update now that I'm (semi)well again.

After the 1st drainage procedure on Monday, my belly continued to fill with fluid again (thus, the above post) and on Tuesday morning, I spoke to one of the nurses, questioning if things were actually getting better. I clearly told her that I actually thought I was getting worse, to which she responded, ""Just keep up with the Gatorade and this will get better"" while adding, ""We're all booked for procedures tomorrow"" and then helpfully suggesting that, ""This will pass and you'll realize it's not not really all that bad."" (I hate her.)

Tuesday night, I called the on-call doctor because I gained 3 lbs in 3 hours, and my belly grew 1.5 inches in that same amount of time. The doc booked me for an early ultrasound/bloodwork appt on Wednesday morning, which revealed that I had significant fluid build up, all the way above my diaphragm, and confirmed that I needed another drainage procedure (scheduled for Thursday). She sent me home with anti-nausea meds and an RX for percocet (which I didn't even fill, because I work in the mental health field, with people who struggle with substance abuse, and I am super weary of narcotics!).

Thursday AM - my lovely, blessed primary IVF doc was the one on duty for my procedure (prior to this, I had seen other docs in her practice). She got 3 liters of fluid out of my abdomen, and told me that I'll never experience this again because she'll trigger me with Lupron next time (if there is a next time) rather than HCG. I also had to stay at the clinic for an extra hour to receive an Albumin infusion via IV (blood plasma protein) to help rehydrate my blood. The Albumin wasn't covered by insurance, so that was a fun $400 surprise!

On Friday, I took 3 naps and could barely stand for more than 10 minutes - so much soreness in my back and belly from where the liquid had been squishing my muscles and organs! Did more bloodwork at the lab and they confirmed that my numbers were improving. My abdomen continued to shrink over the weekend; yesterday, I stood up tall and upright for the first time in 7 days, and it was glorious. Now, I'm basically at 80% in terms of discomfort/energy level. 

As far as where we are in the process of things, they had gotten 31 eggs, 24 were injected via ICSI, 14 fertilized and on day 5... 6 had ""hatched."" Those 6 are now undergoing PGD, so we'll know more in 10 days. The numbers started out so good and ended up being disappointing - supposedly, the difficulty with fertilization might be due to the fact that we had to use epididymal sperm, which my doc said are ""younger, less mature and somewhat less strong."" It's a f*cking bummer, as no one had mentioned that epididymal sperm could be a negative factor... we thought the tough part would be the PGD process, since my husband has CF and I have a related variant. :-( ",t2_c6c61,False,,0,False,Ohss and feeling defeated,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_3esu5u,False,dark,0.71,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,self,1438642955.0,,[],{},,True,,1438050593.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I typically lurk here and don&#39;t often post, but I really need some advice/support today.

10,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi,

I have read on several sites that couples with sperm quality issues should limit sexual intercourse to once every 36-48 hours during her fertile period. To me, this seems counterintuitive: I get that by having sex twice a day four days in a row, the sperm count will probably be very low by the end of the fourth day, but won't the total number of sperms inside her be greater anyway?

As an example of why I find this theory difficult to understand, I'm going to make a quick calculation based on the following hypotheses:

* At ""full charge"", a man has 100 sperms ready to shoot (I'm aware that isn't a realistic figure, but for the sake of clarity, simple numbers are always preferable in examples).

* With each attempt, the total number of sperms in the ejaculate is halved.

* It would take 3 days to go back from 0 to 100%, therefore, a man replenishes 33.3 sperms every day, or 16.6 every 12 hours.

Now, I decided to apply these three hypotheses to three different scenarios: couple A, who have sex every 48 hours, couple B, 24 hours, and couple C, who are evidently blessed with a lot of spare time and do it every 12 hours.

On [this graph](http://imgur.com/dQniY3D,lwugWt9#0), you can see the total number of sperms per single ejaculation for the three different couples. At first glance, it would seem that having sex every other day could improve the chances of impregnation: Mr. A shoots 50 sperms every time, while on day 3 Mr. B's semen has already dropped to approximately 35, and Mr. C's is diluted to about 17.

However, if we look at the [total number of sperms injected](http://imgur.com/dQniY3D,lwugWt9#1), we can see that at the end, it is clearly Mrs. C who carries the most sperms inside her, and that makes perfect sense, because couple A only use 50 sperms every two days, while couple C drops to a steady 16.6 *every twelve hours*, which means approximately 33 every day, or 66 every two days.

My question to you now is: how wrong are my hypotheses? I know my model fails to take into account motility - or rather, it implicitly assumes that motility won't be affected by intercourse frequency. Is there something else I'm missing? 

Does it really make sense to only have sex two-three times during her fertile days?

Thanks for reading this. And yeah, I know, I'm overthinking this. Can't help it.

I know how unusual this may seem, but I discuss all my infertility issues with my dad. He is a surgeon and very into holistic medicine. He is an amazing doctor and even more amazing person. However, my parents did not struggle having kids, by the time my mom was my age, she already had three kids. 

Talking about the emotional part of infertility with my parents has been awful, there is no way they can understand it.

I can tell he has been reading about it a lot, that's what he does, he loves to research illnesses and find cures for them. My dad is not an emotional man, but I can tell my issue is bothering him a lot.

I had a long chat with him on the phone last night and I broke down after I hung up. I was telling him that the plan was Clomid until October, and that we will go see another fertility specialist in November, and possibly start doing injectables in January.

We are trying for baby number two, and I wanted to start off with femara, but my RE told me it would be a waste of my time. Personally, I am not ready to head back into IVF again, and I just wanted to cling on to a little bit of hope before submitting myself to the torture once more. 

In either case, my friend sent me some leftover femara. My RE doesn't know I am taking, nor does my OBGYN. I did six rounds of clomid in the past, and on my first four, I ovulated on CD 18 every cycle, without the aid of a trigger. 

Well, now I am on CD 23, and I still don't think I ovulated based on my temperatures. I was hopeful on CD 15 because I had a lot of pressure and bloating (sort of like before an egg retrieval), and then on CD 19, and I had two positive OPKs, though OPKs suck. I'm more bummed than I thought I would be. 

Can you tell me your femara (without a trigger) stories? What were you diagnosed with? What dose did you take? Did you O? What day did you O? 


EDIT: I am a big girl, and I am aware of the risk I am taking. I've researched, I've been around the block quite a few times with fertility treatments, and I've discussed Femara with my doctor. As for downvoting me -- that's not very supportive, nor is it supportive to berate me for my choice. Not cool. I came asking for information about ovulation dates, not to ask about the risks of not being monitored, which not all clomid/femara cycles are.

EDIT 2: Thank you for all your support. I went ahead and called the doctor today to get the ball rolling next cycle. We aren't going to do IVF until October at the earliest, but I am hoping the doctor will agree and go ahead with a Femara cycle. It probably won't be monitored, though, since I have to pay out the ass for each monitoring session, but we will see. Thank you for kicking me in the butt. I needed it.

My question is a sensitive/private thing to ask about, so I don't blame anyone who doesn't care to answer: how much did a round of IVF (or however many rounds you had) *actually* cost when you paid entirely out-of-pocket? Including meds, fees, etc... you know, all that stuff they tend to be vague about during a consultation.

I do know it varies a lot depending on where you are and what clinic you choose. I guess I'm just looking for some real-world figures from actual people.

My husband and I have no insurance coverage for anything but basic diagnostic stuff. We have a lump sum of $25K set aside for our entire IVF treatment. But after a couple of consults we've been looking at it and worrying that it won't be enough. Which seems ridiculous! It's so much money, and it looks like a smaller amount every time we look at a damn fee schedule. We felt so blessed to have that amount- and believe me, I still do know how lucky we are- but with IVF it seems like there is always more and more and more that needs to be paid for.

We've gone to two consultations so far. At the first, the price quoted for a two-cycle package was out of our price range, and that wasn't even considering meds and anesthesia fees etc. The second consultation gave us a lower price, but there were way less services included in the upfront cost.

My RE doesn't really do any exploratory surgery to look for endometriosis, because she figures that IVF would be better anyway.

I know many of you have had surgery for endometriosis, so I thought I'd bring this to you.

Best I can tell, opinions vary widely about how much endometriosis impairs fertility (depending on severity, of course), and also many people believe that removing the endometriosis is only a short-term solution, because it comes back.  So it seems questionable if it actually helps solve anything.  

Also, I don't really have any symptoms of endometriosis, though I do have a familial history of it (my mother and maternal grandmother).  So it's certainly possible it's there.  And the guy who was gung-ho about it seemed to think that endometriosis could not only inhibit fertility, but could also lead to increased risk of miscarriage.  So I guess IVF aside, I wouldn't want to do all of that then still with increased risk?

Designed and 3D printed, because I have a 3D printer. People who have 3D printers frequently suffer from ""every problem becomes a nail"" syndrome. If I were making more than one of these, just cutting and gluing acrylic sheet would be a better option.

But ANYWAYS. I made a thing! It's designed to keep just a few doses (one box, essentially) of supplies out on the table, while the rest hides in the fridge where I don't have to look at it. Doesn't include the Cetrotide because that needs to be refrigerated. Menopur and Gonal F don't have to be kept cold.

If I were redesign and reprint, I would make the Menopur and Sodium Chloride solution sections a bit larger; they were suppose to be large enough for four vials each but they didn't quite fit. Also the Q-Caps are in a bit tight. I might also make the section for the Gonal F pen and syringes a bit higher; I was concerned it wasn't tall enough to keep the pen stable but it appears to be totally ok.

I also added in a syringe rest. Ideally, you never put a syringe down. It's mix; stab; discard. However, shit happens, and I wanted somewhere safe to put the syringe down in case I need to.

If my baseline goes well tomorrow, I begin the stabbing on Monday.

48,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'm sure this is posted often, but I just really need to get this off of my chest. 

I have a good friend, who I love dearly, and only wish the best for. But she's not exactly the brightest when it comes to life decisions, and over the last year I've realized that she's got a victim complex roughly the size of Manhattan. I don't judge her on that though, it's who she is, and although it bugs me, it's easy enough to let slide on most topics. 

Lately though, I've had to distance myself significantly, and today I'm pretty sure that steam is going to start coming out of my ears. 

Here's the short story:

Although they live from penny to penny, she was a housewife by choice, and then when they had an ""oops"" after they stopped using condoms, she naturally transitioned to being a stay at home mom. Her daughter is now 5 months. She doesn't drive, never has, and she has no outlets for socialization unless I or another friend goes to her, or her husband takes her somewhere. She and her husband were avid gamers, which is totally cool, except that her husband seems to find gaming more important than his wife or daughter, and therefore she's on her own parenting a lot. 

She's talking to me on messenger right now, and WILL NOT STOP BITCHING about how bad it is to have a baby who cluster feeds, who wants to be latched to her 24/7, who won't let her sit and play video games.... 
Logically I know that it would probably get old to never have more than 1 arm available at any given time for months on end. I know that working on very little sleep would be exhausting and I'd start to question my sanity at some point. But she is completely and painfully aware of my situation. She knows that we've been trying for over a year and a half now, and knows that I've been going to doctors for nearly that long to try and get pregnant. How does she not see how painful it would be for me to hear all of this when I'd pretty much give my left ovary to have a clinger on me, to have a baby who cluster feeds and gets upset when I leave the room. I'm trying to be nice and not say anything, but I'm about to blow my top. I'm guessing that she's suffering from some post partum depression, but I'm having a really difficult time being sympathetic about it. 

Sorry if this is just a ramble. I just have no idea what to say to her. I just responded to her last message about how terrible having a 5 month old is with ""I understand"". But you know what? I don't. Even though I was a nanny for years, I don't have a child of my own. I can't. No matter how much I want one, no matter how well set up we are financially we are, no matter how much sex we have, I can't do it. Not without serious medical intervention. And she does not seem to even have that on her radar, and that hurts like hell. 


Edit: 
This is the last part of our conversation. She saw it, but has not responded. I don't think I went overboard, but I feel bad that maybe I made her feel bad....

>Her: I don't want to be another one of those people who only talks about the positives and then you look back at them and you're like wtf crack were you on lol
There are lots of positives, but holy crap, I guess for some people going through the baby stages are like childbirth, they forget about the pain that comes after lol
And you are working on it, it is going to happen for you guys. I know it is. :)

>Me: Only with medical intervention. BIG TIME intervention.

>Her: Yeah but you are looking into it. You haven't given up

>Me: No...but honestly it's about as painful as anything that I've gone through. Truthfully I'd be thrilled to have a velcro baby right now.

How does she not see how painful it would be for me to hear all of this when I&#39;d pretty much give my left ovary to have a clinger on me, to have a baby who cluster feeds and gets upset when I leave the room. I&#39;m trying to be nice and not say anything, but I&#39;m about to blow my top. I&#39;m guessing that she&#39;s suffering from some post partum depression, but I&#39;m having a really difficult time being sympathetic about it. </p>

<p>Sorry if this is just a ramble. I just have no idea what to say to her. I just responded to her last message about how terrible having a 5 month old is with &quot;I understand&quot;. But you know what? I don&#39;t. Even though I was a nanny for years, I don&#39;t have a child of my own. I can&#39;t. No matter how much I want one, no matter how well set up we are financially we are, no matter how much sex we have, I can&#39;t do it. Not without serious medical intervention. And she does not seem to even have that on her radar, and that hurts like hell. </p>

<p>Edit: 
This is the last part of our conversation. She saw it, but has not responded. I don&#39;t think I went overboard, but I feel bad that maybe I made her feel bad....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Her: I don&#39;t want to be another one of those people who only talks about the positives and then you look back at them and you&#39;re like wtf crack were you on lol
There are lots of positives, but holy crap, I guess for some people going through the baby stages are like childbirth, they forget about the pain that comes after lol
And you are working on it, it is going to happen for you guys. I know it is. :)</p>

<p>Me: Only with medical intervention. BIG TIME intervention.</p>

<p>Her: Yeah but you are looking into it. You haven&#39;t given up</p>

<p>Me: No...but honestly it&#39;s about as painful as anything that I&#39;ve gone through. Truthfully I&#39;d be thrilled to have a velcro baby right now. Not to invalidate your feelings, because I know that it can&#39;t be easy, but honestly it feels like my skin is being flayed off every time I think about it. Which is all the time.</p>

She thinks that I simply have issues ovulating so we did two IUI rounds and those failed, she's recommended that we move to a ICSI IVF round with PGS testing to see if maybe there are some latent chromosomal issues that we didn't catch with the genetic testing.

1.  The follicles were measured at 3:30 pm and I am supposed to give myself the trigger shot late tonight.  Are my follicles too big?  

2.  The IUI is scheduled for Wednesday am, 36 hours after trigger - any thoughts on this timing?

4.  MFI is not really an issue.  Should we have sex tonight (36 hours before IUI) or abstain?

5.  Is there anything my husband can do at this point to make the sample he gives as good as possible?

89,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, I've been lurking for a while on whether or not I should even post. I feel awful posting, I know mostly everyone here has endured and has been through a lot and I've only just started.

Since, I'm not sure when, let's say 2009 my cycles have been irregular. I'd skip a month or three between each period. I started dating my current husband back then and we didn't use protection, hardly ever. I wasn't on birth control either.

Sometime between then and now, my periods would get farther apart, maybe 6 months between them before they just completely stopped. A year passed by and all the time I was worried about 'What if I can never have children?' 'Why am I not having a period?' , but I knew I wasn't ready for a child so I just, I guess, enjoyed not having one.

After being with my husband for 4 years (not yet married till our 6th year) and a lot of worrying information from a friend, I decide to go to the doctor to figure out what's going on.

She really doesn't find anything wrong out of all of my blood tests and sonograms. Maybe a hormone imbalance? I asked her if it was because of my weight, but she said she didn't think so (I had gained a lot after a car accident and a back injury. I am obese.) 

So July 2014 I, with the help of progesterone and clomid (I mentioned I wanted children) I got my first period and tested positive on day 21 for ovulation. I had a complete cycle of 32 days. It lasted for three months ( I only took clomid the one month) and my period was gone again.  November 2014 I decided to only kick start the period with progesterone and skip on the clomid (a friend had told me horrible false? things about it) and it worked again, but this time I did not have another period until January and then it disappeared yet again.

I never saw my doctor again, but rather communicated with her through calling her nurses. I wanted to avoid clomid because of the horrible pain, acne, and moods I had on it, but they convinced me to try it again.

So I was married in April and started Progesterone and Clomid in May (Pro was just to kick start it again, I've only taken it once since then.) I'm currently 3 days away from my expected period, my third round of clomid if I happen to start, and my body has been playing tricks on me.

Suddenly I'll feel nauseous and want to get sick, but after two gags I feel just like my self. Only twice so far have I actually gotten sick. It only happens about 2 or 3 minutes after I take a prenatal pill, so I've convinced myself that my body is an asshole and it's just the pills.

Anyway, there is my story/rant/life so far. I've only just started and I may have way more a head of me and it may not seem like much, but it sucks for me.

I was still a little tired, but I blame that on the progesterone injections my husband was giving me. And my boobs stopped hurting. Sign number one. Sign number two came Sunday prior to my blood test. I started to spot like I was starting my period. I was pretty sure that I had implantation bleeding the day after my transfer. I was super excited about that. But when this spotting started, I was really bummed and of course cried. I tried to think positive about it, thinking maybe THIS was implantation bleeding. I did a little research and what I found was that this bleeding was too late for implantation bleeding. But everyone is different though. I did what they told me not to do and took a HPT too. I was far enough away from the trigger shot and close enough for an early prediction test. The test was negative. Sign number three. Waiting those next two and half days was very sad for me. I was really nervous for the news. Wednesday came and results were in. I took a half day that day because I didn't want to ball at work. And ball I did. I cried so hard, I almost choked. I had to tell myself to calm down so that I could breathe. My husband came home to comfort me. The first thing he asked me was if I was already drunk! haha. We joked the day before about how this would be how I would coup with the news. He was bummed by the news too, which made me even more disappointed. Although not surprised, I'm still really sad about the outcome. 

I think what makes things even more difficult is that I have no reserves in cryo. Only 2 of my 14 made it to transfer (per a previous post, 4 were immature, 3 degenerated, 5 fertilized fine, 2 made it to transfer day). I'm not excited about having to go through this whole process over again and spending all that money. 

After talking to a couple people and doing some research, I feel like since I felt different and had some pregnancy signs, I wonder if my embryo(s) actually implanted but my endometriosis cause a ""miscarriage"" of sorts. That is one of the (many) questions I will be bringing to my doctor when I see him on July 28.  

I know this is only my first round, but this failure puts another huge hole in my hope. I'm so afraid that none of this is going work, that my endo is going keep rejecting embryos and never let me get pregnant. I've been trying to do research on ways that doctors could help ""trick"" my uterus and endo into not rejecting the embryos, but haven't found anything yet.

During an HSG in May, I found out that I have two blocked tubes, both of which are salpingectomies.  During the HSG, some of the fluid forced a slight opening in my left tube, but our RE said that it was still essentially blocked and that our chances of conceiving on our own are close to 0%.  That month, right before the HSG, I had taken five days of Letrozole (first time taking any IF drugs).  We had already planned our very first IUI for that month and had decided to go forward anyway (because that tube had opened up a bit during the HSG and our thinking was it was the first time we had had any chance at all, so we might as well go for it).  But the day before the IUI, our RE called and told us about the dilated tubes and advised us to cancel the IUI because of a high risk of ectopic pregnancy.  

We had already had sex once that cycle, the day before my positive OPK.  I got my period on CD 24, which was June 13th, and it was a pretty normal one except with slightly worse cramps than usual, which I attributed to the Letrozole/HSG.  

My cycles have all been between 24-27 days for the last year, though I had a couple 28 and 29 days cycles the year before last.  I have never, ever in my life had a cycle longer than 30 days except once when I was 19 and I was a week or two late.  

The following month (this cycle) we didn't have sex at all until CD 30 or so, when I was already wondering where my period was, but expecting it at any minute.  Now it's CD 36 and still nothing.  I took a pregnancy test earlier this week just to be safe, but wasn't surprised at all when it was negative as we'd had almost no sex (my hopes weren't up or anything either and if I had found a positive, I would have assumed ectopic).  

I've had some cramping most days and several times have been sure I'm about to start, but nothing has happened.  I've had a few lightheaded moments, but that could be attributable to a variety of things.  Much of the time I feel totally normal.  

The only other out of the ordinary thing that bears mentioning is that right around the time I started expecting my period, around CD 24, I began experiencing something very similar to EWCM, which lasted for about a week.  Usually I get that for couple days around ovulation time, right in the middle of my cycle, and that's it.  So that was weird.  

I know that periods can be late for many reasons varying from stress to hormonal shifts to changes in diet and exercise, and that's probably what this is.  There's no shortage of stress around here, and I could point to a lot of other possible reasons.  But I've had many stressful times, etc. in my 39 years and *never* had a cycle longer than 30 days.  So I'm starting to wonder if this could be an ectopic, as our RE really stressed how much of a risk that was for us (one of the reasons we didn't have sex this month).  But I had a period last month, so that seems improbable.  Could it be the Letrozole from the last week of May having some strange, delayed effect on me?  Has anyone experienced anything like this before?  I don't really know what there is to do other than just wait and see, but perhaps I'm missing something.  Am I overthinking this?  Ugh.  I'm annoyed with myself.

Thanks for any insight, and thanks for listening.  

UPDATE:  For those who may have a similar issue and find this in a search:  Period finally came on CD 41.  I don't know if it was stress delayed or possibly an ectopic, but it's over.

We've been TTC since Feb 2014, and I've been seeing my current RE for about 3 months, after seeing a really terrible one for about 6. I was informed about 3 weeks ago after all the testing (HSG test, internal ultrasounds, and ALL the blood work. SO MUCH BLOOD WORK!) that I have a less than 1% chance of getting pregnant naturally, and that IVF is my best chance of getting pregnant before pigs start flying.

So after some very tearful discussions, we agreed that IVF is the way that we're going to go, especially since it would allow us to do genetic testing on ourselves, and if we wanted, the embryo. 

I'm thrilled to announce that neither my husband or I are carriers for genetic diseases, and being in our early 30's, according to the doctors we're at very low risk for chromosomal abnormalities. HOWEVER, they still strongly suggest that we spend the extra $2,000+ on the embryo testing, just to be sure. 

Here's where I'm totally mixed up and don't know what to do. 
If we had gotten pregnant naturally, obviously there's no way for me to have had the opportunity to check the embryo for chromosome issues until later down the line in the pregnancy. And I would have never thought twice about it. But now that we have the option, and since the doctors office seems to think it's the best thing since sliced bread, I now pretty much feel guilty for NOT wanting to get the testing done, and just let the cards fall where they may. I am very, very, very lucky that my insurance covers up to 6 tries, so I have a bit less anxiety I guess about how much each round costs. Obviously I want the healthiest happiest baby that I can get, but I am having a difficult time justifying the testing when we'll have spent so much already, and an additional $2k could do so much more spent elsewhere. Am I crazy for this train of thought? I guess I really just need affirmation that I'm not starting my potential future child's life off terribly if I don't do this testing. Or tell me that I am and that I need to stop being so cheap. Either way, I appreciate the input.

I've been in extreme, extreme pain and sick from the pain meds and pain itself so it's taken me a while to be able to type this out, but I did want to type it out because it was quite a bit different than what I was expecting- and that's likely a lot of my own fault for not looking into lap recovery more. 

First, the hysteroscopy was to cut down a partial septum that was discovered during my SIS. That went smoothly and I'm now on Estradiol to help my lining thicken so that I heal properly from the septum removal. I have had minor bleeding from that which was mostly bright pink/red in a light flow. 

Now to the laparoscopy! I was having it done because a 2.5cm endometrioma was found in my left ovary during the same SIS. With that discovery added to my extensive endometriosis symptoms, my RE decided that a lap and endo ablation was the best course of action prior to starting out IVF cycle, even though she did not plan to attempt to remove the endometrioma for fear of losing follicles. Looking back, this was a very wise decision because as my RE put it, my entire abdominal cavity was ""overtaken by very severe endometriosis"" which she said was at least Stage 4. She also found one of my tubes to be swollen (hydrosalpinx) and the other tube was completely blocked off and closed by endometriosis scarring. I lost both tubes that day and a 45 minute lap turned into a 3 hour endometriosis removal and bilateral salpingectomy. 

If we had not already been fully prepared to move onto IVF, I would be an utter basket case with depression and grief, but due to the suspected endometriosis and severe MFI (nerve damage leading to low volume but high count) we have already planned and saved to begin IVF mid-August. I was not at all expecting to lose my tubes and I am sad that I'll never be able to naturally conceive or to get that amazing ""surprise"" pregnancy that may have been possible, but like I said, we knew we were doing IVF so I'm okay. 

The thing I was the least prepared for was/is the pain. It feels as if I am a jack-o-lantern and someone scraped my insides out with one of those serrated paddles. The first day, I was out of it on anesthesia, but that night I barely slept due to the pain and inability to pee but having the urgency to go. Then yesterday, I was in total agony. I could not lay or sit in any position that was not brutally painful. I was/am so swollen and I've put on 6 pounds of fluid. I did go in to see my RE at her insistence when I called about my pain levels. She showed me the pictures of my insides (endo scarring and tissue on my diaphragm, liver, bladder, bowels, tubes, uterus, ovaries, and urethra- it looked like someone had set off firecrackers in there) and explained everything to me that had happened. She suggested suppository laxatives to relieve some pressure (they did not work) and gave me 10 more Percocet on top of the 12 she gave me post-op and told me to take two at a time. I did and puked 30 minutes later- haha. So back to taking one Percocet about ever two to four hours and 800mg ibuprofen at 8hr intervals. I have another appt in the morning because she is concerned about my stomach swelling (it's big) and I'm hoping to get a different medication that doesn't make me so sick. 

So there's my story so far. IVF is tentatively scheduled for August 14 to start meds! We are so excited. We have allowed ourselves to get excited for the first time in 3.5 years and it feels good and scary and lovely all at once. Thanks for reading and letting me vent! Is anyone else doing IVF at the same time as we are?

-Endo

-Fibroids

-Retroverted uterus

-MFI (low sperm concentration)

The RE has said the next steps are to have a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy to remove any endo tissue. Then move onto IVF. 
Really annoyed that the OBGYN didn't pick this up when I visited him 7 months ago. Feeling worried about the lap/hys because I have to have GA (RE said they wouldn't do it under sedation) and I've already had 2 GAs (for appendectomy and tonsillectomy) in the last 2 years and worried it will affect my brain function or something if I keep having them regularly.

I'm also worried about the costs of IVF, its not covered by insurance here so it'll all be out of pocket and about $12000 per cycle. The clinic will only replace 1 embryo at a time too.

The RE said that I could try 3 months on monitored letrozole but that it probably won't be effective.

What are your thoughts? This was a lot of news to take in one sitting.

My husband had a scrotal ultrasound and a urologist/andrologist appointment to discuss. Turns out he has a varicocele in his left testicle which the urologist suspects is contributing to his severe MFI. His testosterone is also 'on the low side of normal for a man of 29 years old'.

My husband wants to get the surgery to remove the varicocele. Anyone had any experience with this? We can't ask our RE for his advice because he's been overseas for over a month and not back yet. My husband booked the surgery. He says he has nothing to lose. Hopefully that's true.

Interestingly it seems his CF gene mutation is not the reason for his MFI. The urologist didn't mention a missing vas. 

We were intending to start IVF-ICSI in October but as his surgery is in August and he wants to wait the 3 months to see if there's been any improvement in his sperm we now probably won't start IVF-ICSI until November.

Hi guys. I'm still in a fog of pain so I may not get to edit until tomorrow. Today I had a lap done ""just to make sure"" my ovaries weren't strapped down by endo and would be accessible for egg retrieval in late Aug/early Sept. At the same time, I had a septum in my uterus clipped via hysteroscopy while I was out. 

My main reason for writing is the absolutely unbearable amount of pain I am in. I was told by my RE that I would have very minimal pain and ibuprofen should do the trick. Well, this was before she got inside me and saw the plague of endo tissue that was so extensive, it had covered parts of my liver and possibly my diaphragm. My husband fielded the quick post-op phone call because the surgery was only supposed to be 45 mins but ended up being 3 hours due to how much endo had to be removed. The RE is still very hopeful for our IVF cycle but I'm in a bit of shock. She also removed my right tube due to endo damage and dilation. 

I guess I'm just here to complain and look for similar experiences. I'll be x-posting this in r/endo as well as calling my doctor back tomorrow to tell her that the tiny dose of Percocet she gave me is NOT cutting it for pain.

It breaks my heart to watch, and I know I would feel strange being there during the first trimester while people are talking about real, breathing babies-in-arms mixed with my ""what if this doesn't happen"" feelings. I'm even thinking a quarantined ""results thread"" like on /r/infertility for birth stories, considering how fragile I will feel if I ever get pregnant. Something like ""IFPregnancy"".

However, /r/InfertilityBabies was *totally* set up as ""past the first positive"" in the first place. It was the name and the fact that I know a mother who is in that sub that mixed me up.

/r/ttcafterloss has alumni threads but it doesn't seem like that's an option unless you had a loss along the way. 

There is no way to put this that doesn't sound like I want to kick the IFBabies parents out of the sub, or pressure the entire meaning of IFBabies to chance. That sounds horrifying to me; I've just painted myself into that corner with my way of approaching the problem.

At my Tuesday suppression check my doctor thought she saw two developing follicles (one on each ovary) and that I was ovulating through my birth control. My estrogen however was normal and did not indicate ovulation. She had me take two more days of birth control and then come in on Thursday for another suppression check. On Thursday she wasn't sure what she saw; she said it could be either follicles, cysts, or fluid. My estrogen was still normal. My doctor said she wanted everything to be ""perfect"" and that if it wasn't then we should wait this month out. She had me take the pill that night and then come in today for a third suppression check.

Today's suppression check was with a different doctor, one who is a bit older and presumably has more experience. Anyway, she said that they definitely weren't follicles or cysts but instead were just fluid around the endometriomas on both ovaries and that it wasn't anything to worry about. She said that the fluid shouldn't effect the IVF cycle or egg quality and that if I were her patient, she'd tell me to go forward with my IVF cycle. She said she'd talk to my doctor later this afternoon, however, and that the clinic would get back to me about whether I should start stims tonight or not. Weekend doctor then went on to say this: ""Look, I understand wanting everything to be perfect and what Dr. L is trying to go for here. The thing is, we see this all the time with endo patients and I worry that if we keep you waiting we might be chasing ghosts; if this is fluid it might never go away nor have any effect on your cycle.""

Obviously I am relieved and happy to hear that we might not have to wait a month after all, but in spite of the weekend doctor's assurances, I'm still worried about that damn fluid. I know fluid elsewhere in the abdomen, such as the uterus or the fallopian tubes, is bad news. I'm not sure why this would be any different, especially since it appears to be related to my endo.

I need this before proceeding with IVF because both tubes are hydrosalpinxes (dilated and filled with toxic fluid that can back up into the uterus and cause miscarriage).  

She suggested that instead of surgery, we consider Essure, which is a permanent form of birth control, essentially metal coils that are inserted into the fallopian tubes.  The coils block the tubes and scar tissue builds up around them to ensure permanent blockage.  This is usually used as a nonsurgical alternative to tubal ligation.  
But, while less common, Essure is also sometimes used instead of salpingectomy, is much less costly, and also supposedly takes like ten minutes to insert.  

I have to have a uterine polyp removed in vis hysteroscopy in August, and the idea would be to insert the Essure at the same time.  That way I could avoid the costly and more invasive surgery to actually remove the tubes.  I'd have to wait three months for the scar tissue to form, then I could do IVF.  I could start suppression as early as October if I had them inserted in August during my polyp removal, which is already scheduled.  

It sounds great and like a no-brainer when I write it all out, but I guess I feel a little reluctant to put permanent metal coils in my abdomen and reproductive organs.  Obviously, those of us here probably haven't done much investigating of permanent birth control, but I'm wondering if anyone has any experience or familiarity with Essure for this reason, or any thoughts about this in general.  (I'm also interested in hearing from anyone with salpingectomy/hydrosalpinx experience.)  Thanks, y'all.

US: Me (f) 28.  6 years of BC, ended it 3 months before trying and we just used condoms.   This was September of 2013.  Infertile maternal history, mom needed thyroid meds (but then had 4), and her aunts ranged from childless to 3 kids (in the 1940s, so strange).  Husband, 50, 3 teenagers, no trauma, no vastecomy.

Story: lots of sex, lots of disappointment, 1 chemical pregnancy, ask OB on annual that it has been 9 months and I want to get checked, she says need to try for a year.  Temp and do OPKs.  I show ovulation, always have a temp dip around 10-12DPO and period at CD 27-29.  Doc not worried.  January comes, CD3/CD26/HSG/ultrasound all normal.  Hub tests, a few abnormalities, go to specialists.  I spot monthly around CD 24

Hubs abnormalities is low count (68mil), low motility (50%) but neither count as ""infertile"" just low.  Urologist affirms that everything is in the right spot and connected, no reason on his end for no babies.  RE decides IUI, starting with a natural cycle.

May: I get my positive test, husband contributes his sample with 31mil in cleaned sperm (they want above 5), motility was at 45%, we were told that was good.  We are also told insurance will not cover because Hubs is older than 40, doctor is appealing.  I got my period after 32 days.

June: Clomid 50mg for 4 days.  Husbands sample had 25mil and they didn't tell us motility.  I had 2 mature follicles, one on either side, and a healthy lining.  Period after 28 days.  Insurance confirms they will not cover procedures.  Insurance sucks.

July: I have just finished Clomid 50mg for 5 days.  I am thinking our round will be on Monday.  I have started acupuncture, had a massage, bought some essential oils for myself (YL dragon time and progressence plus if anyone else has tried) and my husband (basil for foot rubs).  I got my husband boxers.  We have decided that I don't have to wake with the alarm and hope extra sleep will help, i have told my boss I will likely be working a reduced schedule to help with stress for two weeks.

The original plan was only 3 rounds of IUI, which means this is our last chance.  We do not want to do IVF, partially because of the 12k price tag, but it just isn't for us.  I want to talk my RE into a few more rounds of IUI with different meds (progestrone for one), but I'm not sure how much control I have over that.

Does anyone have other suggestions?  There is no reason for our infertility, and that makes it suck more.  None of my friends are having difficulty, and while nice to bitch to, they have no words for me other than ""wow, that sucks.""  ""what happens, happens.""
