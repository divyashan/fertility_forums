A quick little recap -- Mr.ApolloBollo and I just finished our third, and final, IUI the other day. Our clinic does two back-to-back attempts (does this count as six attempts? I dunno.) for each cycle and thus far it's a no-go (no doi.) We are at almost three years of trying with one pregnancy back in March 2016 that ended in a miscarriage at three months. Since then we've run the gamut with tests and everything comes back with us both looking annoyingly ""normal."" We start our first IVF cycle next month.....

BUT, the other day I was on my RE's patient portal where they have each of our IUI cycles with all the measurements and blood test results, and I started zeroing in on my lining thickness. The more I was thinking about it the more I started Googling (is this where I took the wrong turn and the wheels started coming off?) and the more I Googled the more it seemed the general consensus amongst RE's is that you want a lining between 8mm-13mm to have the greatest chance of implantation success. Mine has never gotten over 7.51mm and now I'm contemplating shoving Viagra up my vagina in the hopes that maybe it'll make a more cozy and well-appointed baby-house.

<p>A quick little recap -- Mr.ApolloBollo and I just finished our third, and final, IUI the other day. Our clinic does two back-to-back attempts (does this count as six attempts? I dunno.) for each cycle and thus far it&#39;s a no-go (no doi.) We are at almost three years of trying with one pregnancy back in March 2016 that ended in a miscarriage at three months. Since then we&#39;ve run the gamut with tests and everything comes back with us both looking annoyingly &quot;normal.&quot; We start our first IVF cycle next month.....</p>

<p>BUT, the other day I was on my RE&#39;s patient portal where they have each of our IUI cycles with all the measurements and blood test results, and I started zeroing in on my lining thickness. The more I was thinking about it the more I started Googling (is this where I took the wrong turn and the wheels started coming off?) and the more I Googled the more it seemed the general consensus amongst RE&#39;s is that you want a lining between 8mm-13mm to have the greatest chance of implantation success. Mine has never gotten over 7.51mm and now I&#39;m contemplating shoving Viagra up my vagina in the hopes that maybe it&#39;ll make a more cozy and well-appointed baby-house. (I don&#39;t even know where to get Viagra from, clearly this is just a crazed pipe-dream). </p>

My question is, given my husband's SA results, is investing in the supplements even worth it? In Canada it's about 75 a month.

23,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband and I are saving money and time to start IVF this summer. At least that’s the plan. Trouble is that I have no idea how to plan the time I need. I’m a lawyer and I know that I am most likely going to have several trials/hearings this summer (June/July and maybe August). I can probably space them out enough to have at least a week or two in between each trial and I can take several weeks off of work (although probably not in a row). I will not be the lead for every hearing/trial but I will be the lead for some and assisting with all.

Any tips from those of you who have done IVF on what I need to plan for time wise? I know that a lot of this will be unpredictable with my cycle timing, but i have to try to plan as much as I can. I’m hoping that if I at least build some windows into my schedule and plan to take some time off, I can make this work.

I just moved over here from TTC_PCOS after my husband got a 1% normal morphology count on his sperm analysis.
Background: I have PCOS, able to ovulate on Clomid. Tubes open, everything else apparently normal. Have been trying for about a year. Husband has normal motility and count, but was recently diagnosed with low morphology- only 1%.
Doc advised to do a couple of IUI cycles, and then try for IVF.

A couple of questions for you guys, who have probably been dealing with this for longer than I have:
1. I know how odds of success every cycle are very low - but just how low?
2. Does IUI improve our monthly chances substantially?
3. If we do IVF, we'll need to do ICSI. Are our chances of success lower than for other couples undergoing IVF without any MFI issues?

I'm wondering if it's caused/contributed to by the femara, or just something related to the holidays. This cycle I took it days 5-9, and it's day 22 now & having these feelings. 

I was thinking about asking my Dr about taking an antidepressant, because I can't keep feeling this way. Now I'm wondering if a break from the femara would help. The severity of this depression feels new to me.

I told her ""if you want kids, don't go on birth control"". [Edit: Meaning hormonal types...not just in general aka condoms!] She's one that might actually manage to wait until she's married for sex and she's already said it's one of her goals in life to be a mom, so our conversation went along the lines of ""if you do wait, just use condoms until you're ready for kids and if you have an oops who cares"" but ""if you don't wait, go on the pill but get off of it as soon as you can"".  My mom countered (she only heard my first statement) and said that birth control was her lifesaver...it gave her normalcy in life outside of her debilitating cramps/periods.  Now my mom got pregnant with both of us easily and spent all but 8 months of her fertile years (combined...both of us kids!) on birth control. Then there's me...6 years on BC only to find out I'm screwed up enough that I can't get pregnant anyway. Now I know a lot of women are like my mom and have legit reasons to go on BC.  I didn't and my sister doesn't other than to simply not get pregnant.  We are relatively regular, cramps go away with just a few advil, normal period kind of people.  But since starting this lovely IF journey, I've seen a couple articles saying women are taking longer and longer to ovulate and have normal cycles post BC. Nothing too scientific though.  Everything I've read from the medical world seems to say the opposite, that it's not affecting fertility at all.  Now I don't think BC was the cause of my issues, but I do wonder if maybe my body is not doing what it did before BC.  Like, I'm curious...did I have crappy ovulations and weird hormone levels then too or is this a new development?  So what are your thoughts ladies?  Do you think, or better yet KNOW, that your cycle and ovulation were effected?  Hindsight, was it worth it? For me it was, because I was NOT ready for kids even when we first got married.  But since my sister already KNOWS she wants them and she's older than I was back then anyway...is my advice legit?  Or am I just putting my own crappy IF journey into it and being an overprotective sister?

Our only diagnosis is MFI with a slight varicocele we’ve elected to not have repaired.  My husband has been putting his all into bringing up his sperm quality since about September.  Each SA before we began IUI, we saw some slight improvement— 10-13 million count, 27- 43% motility, 1-3% morphology.  

Our first IUI, things took a turn and we had 800k at the time of the IUI (we blame only having 24 hours of abstinence on this one).  Our second IUI, our prewash count was 34 million, post 8.5 million.  We just did our third IUI and his prewash count was 75 million, post 32 million.  Since our numbers have been progressing, I asked him if he would mind writing down exactly what he has been doing to improve his sperm.  I know that there have been other similar threads before, but I thought it might be nice to have another perspective.  We will see how things continue to progress and I will keep you updated, but this has been our experience so far.  Here’s what he sent me—



Not a medical professional, but I've researched a bunch from the male factor side because I wasn't content with sitting still when I got low numbers, even though our doctors told us there wasn't much to be done. Much of this is from Googling around, but not just 'how to fertility' but also searching for ways to lower numbers so I may do the opposite, reading sperm donor discussions, and trying to tie everything to peer reviewed research.  The latter bit was the hardest - infertility has small sample sets and there are so many more factors than a single patient.  

Diet—
Diet's huge if you're trying to change any part of your body, so I figured I'd start there.

The 'eens'—
Nicotine, caffeine, every ingredient of energy drinks that rhyme - they all seem to wreck sperm. Down to one cup of coffee per day.

Soy—
Soylent goes down the drain (or to other engineers), sushi has to be dunked in soy sauce alternatives like a coconut aminos sauce and I generally avoid Chinese and Japanese food now. While I love soy, but it's easy enough to avoid.

Alcohol—
This one, honestly, can't be that large of an affect for long term.  My numbers have been going up and I still drink between analysis. I do however have zero alcohol the week before an IUI.

Vitamins—
Ramped up my multi-vitamin and fish oil to include pretty much everything medical studies were recommending.  I can provide sources if anyone's interested, but Googling '<vitamin-name> sperm' is how I went about verifying that it was worth my time and money.  I then made sure that the vitamin type would be absorbed easily (like choosing chelated zinc) and did not contain soy, hence the sunflower lecithin.  

Total Daily:
Men's Once Daily Multivitamin & Mineral
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Sunflower Lecithin, 1200mg
Chelated Zinc, 22mg
CoQ10, 600mg
D3, 2000iu

Increase to 2x per day the week before IUI:
Sunflower Lecithin, 1200mg
CoQ10, 600mg

Testicle Heat—
Heat Based Contraception is a thing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat-based_contraception.  I wore boxers instead of boxer briefs (my loving wife hid them...), preferred loose fitting shorts around the house, kept the laptop on a lap desk (like http://amzn.to/2CmStn9), etc.  Everything you've heard, I just included, because it couldn't hurt.

Exercise—
Moderate exercise at least a few times a week. I'm sure you've heard that one before, but so had I, so I gave it a shot.  I've heard you probably shouldn't wear bicycle shorts and go too hard - what with the heat and all.

Edging—
I've seen sperm donors discuss 'edging' or similar techniques leading up to a donation to maximize numbers.  It's also commonly claimed to increase intensity of orgasm.  This is a small set, and I can't find medical studies, but again, I'll try whatever if it's not going to hurt. So, don't be afraid of erections, just don't do anything about them.  Fantasize, watch porn, whatever, your abstinence is about not finishing.",t2_61s5r,False,,0,False,A Note of Male Factor Infertility from my Husband,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_7jwts8,False,dark,0.82,,public,14,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,14,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1513334467.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I just tried posting this but it seems to have been auto-moderated.

We have a referral to a fertility specialist in hand now that insurance will pay for it, but in the meantime while doing some internet investigation I came across a sentence that indicted a correlation between low AMH and obesity.  At 180 lbs and 5&#39;5&quot; I qualify as obese, so I was wondering if losing weight would improve my numbers/fertility?  It doesn&#39;t seem like it should, since you can&#39;t grow more eggs, but does anyone have any thoughts?</p>

I hope someone who’s been in my shoes, or someone who is more assertive and strategic in their communication skills, can offer me some advice.  I had gone through my first IVF cycle this July 2017.  I live in New Jersey; I have the teacher’s insurance, so my infertility benefits are extensive.  I’ve been going as an out-of-network patient to a small clinic in Manhattan based on a friend’s recommendation (my best friend, the OB-GYN, knows the reproductive endocrinologist professionally).  At our first meeting, we were told by the office secretary that my insurance covers up to 13,000, and we’d be responsible for the rest.  We did the cycle, got lots of eggs, paid out of pocket for PGS ($5,900 for 10, if anyone in the area needs to know – via Reprogenetics), then waited a month.  So, my insurance paid for everything handsomely during the stim cycle.  My insurance also paid for every single doctor’s visit, ultrasound, lab work.  I paid $1000 for the first frozen embryo transfer, and $1500 for the cryopreservation right after the egg retrieval.  My first FET did not take.  I’d gone for the second FET (which also did not work); I was given the bill of $3500 for the second FET.   When I raised the question with the doctor, we were told to pay $1000 out of pocket, then “they’d check what the insurance covers”.   The procedure was identical.  No additional tests.  Insurance paid for all the ultrasounds, office visits, blood draws that were done before the second FET.  The practice billed my insurance 10 grand after the second FET; my insurance denied the claim.  Now the secretary is contacting me to pay $2500 out of pocket.  
Is this typical / normal of how the infertility clinics work?  I’ve requested several times for contact information for the biller, and my inquiry is ignored.  Is this normal for them to charge more for the second FET?  How do I word my communication with the office, and what recourse do I have with them or with my insurance?
I am realizing in retrospect, how emotionally vulnerable both I and my husband were at our first visit.  We were so hopeful and so desperate, that we didn’t even know to request an itemized fee schedule or bill.  They are not providing me with itemized bill right now, when I am requesting it.  Any suggestions would be welcome.

Months ago, I mentioned some of my symptoms to my RE and said I thought I might have endometriosis as well as my PCOS.  She basically brushed me off.  Said if *really* wanted one, she could do a lap, but she was certain that my whole problem was lack of ovulation and I just needed expensive fertility drugs.  Given she was so sure, I didn't press - I mean, who *wants* surgery?

Then I went to a new gyn for an annual.  I told her my symptoms and suspicions and *immediately* she offered to do a lap.  She thought it was suspicious too.  She sent pre-auth forms to my insurance (coded for pain!) and I had the procedure this morning.  There *was* endo in me!  I wasn't just, I dunno, a hypochondriac or looking for problems or whatever.  I was *right*.  

I don't know all the details.  My fiance didn't know all the questions to ask, and the nurses in recovery didn't really know.  So all I know now is they found some (a little?) and they burned it out.  Could even this possibly small amount (I don't even know what stage it was) be the reason my IUI's failed despite great numbers?  I go back for post-op the 27th, where I intend to get as many details as possible.  Perhaps, with this sorted, maybe just Clomid+trigger would work?  I don't think IUI is even really necessary - my fiance's numbers are great.  First IUI his count was 93 million, for goodness sake.

98,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey guys....I have had a lot of thoughts going on in my head this last week, and since no one in my real person life gets it except my husband, I was hoping I could just get out all my different thoughts and ask for your opinions.  


Disclaimers- I know that this all really comes down to my husband (fuck it, I can't type out husband 100 times so I'm going with DH, sorry bot) and I needing to make a decision we are both comfortable with, and no one can make that decision but us.  And, we have a WTF meeting with our RE on Wednesday, so anything I say she said was during brief phone conversations when she told us I wasn't pregnant, and we haven't had a real meeting yet.




SO.  I'm 30, DH is 32.  We recently did our first round of IVF, antagonist protocol (I think).  I was on birth control for two full months prior to starting stims, and I had a cyst aspiration the day I started stims.  225 of Gonal F + 20 hcg for 12 days, plus cetrotide starting on Day 7.  E2 was 2128 day of trigger, 2726 the next day.  We got 22 eggs, 16 were mature, 11 fertilized, 10 made it to day 5, but all but two of them were poor quality.  We transferred one fair embryo on Day 5, and by Day 6, nothing was worth freezing.  Transfer failed.  So now we're currently left with nothing.



We are talking about what to do next.  I know the first round of IVF doesn't work for a lot of people but....wow, that was a major fail.  It appears to be egg quality.  Our embryos looked fine, they just didn't grow apparently.  The dr also said maybe I was over suppressed, since I stimmed for two more days and they didn't develop into blasts.



She said we would be getting a refund (we don't know for how much yet.  We paid $20k for a package of three transfers plus IVF, plus another $5k in meds).  My company was recently acquired and I saw that we get $5k in infertility treatments.  So, I estimate I might have ~$9-10k to go towards another round of IVF.  We're comfortable, but not millionaires by any stretch.  We could find ways to finance more treatments, but like, maybe 1-2 more rounds at the VERY most.  


Our RE's suggestion was to read ""It begins with the egg""  I'm at the beginning still, but it appears that this book is mostly going to be telling me that if I eat low carb and avoid BPA, my eggs with be better quality in 3-6 months.  As much as I'm all about taking care of yourself, I really find it extremely hard to believe that all I need to do is cut out sugar for a bit and bam, my eggs will be super.  It wouldn't just be my diet, I know it will involve more supplements and stuff as well.  I'm willing to try of course, but I just know I'm going to spend the whole time obsessing over everything, beating myself up every time I want a glass of wine, etc, basically making myself stressed and anxious over it.  I am also angry and feel like I must be some drunk, disease ridden ho bag with disgusting eggs.  I don't smoke, I eat fairly healthy for most of the day, I exercise regularly.  Obviously I could exercise more and eat better, and I probably drink a little too much, but not excessively.  It just makes me angry that my fairly healthy lifestyle isn't 'good enough'


Our RE also said that we could always try a different protocal as well, maybe try a three day transfer instead of five day (which she was really against when we started IVF), etc, but we haven't met so I'm not sure what other options there are. But I really don't like this whole ""maybe this, maybe that"" method.  No one can finance endless rounds of IVF, and I like to know a solid plan and reasoning behind it. 


So, I know that IVF rounds can have very different results, even with the same protocols, and some people have big success with one kind, and not with the other, and all that.  But man....I am just really hesitant.  It's not just the money, or having to go through that whole thing again, it's just something in the back of my mind that truly believes it won't work again.  I've always had this weird feeling I wasn't able to have a chlid, even ten years ago I felt like I wouldn't be able to.  And once I finally was ready for kids, this thought stayed at the back of my head, even while I was cockily assuming it would take 1-2 months to get pregnant, tops.  Even starting IVF, I naively thought we'd just hit it out of the park during our first round.  Now obviously, none of that happened, and I'm really starting to believe that little subconscious feeling.  



I'm also concerned about money, of course.  So far, we haven't had any insurance coverage and we've depleted a lot of our resources paying for IVF.  I am really uncomfortable with the idea of doing another round that fails, and then not having any resources left to pursue alternative options.  We are not opposed to adoption, but know how hard and expensive and time consuming it can take, and I don't know if we could ever afford it, and we are both way too terrified to try to adopt through the foster system, especially in our state.

My husband and I discussed what the most important parts of ""procuring a child"" are for each of us.  For me, it's having more than one eventually, and carrying a child.  For my husband, it's having a newborn.  

However, I've always been OK with the idea of embryo adoption, and I'm toying with the idea of weather it's a better next step than another round of IVF?  I am really just scared we won't make any embryos, and at least this way it's made already.  I don't have any obvious indication that I wouldn't be able to carry a pregnancy (so far at least).  My husband would like to try another round of IVF first, possibly.  We're both still not wanting to give up trying yet (obviously, no one WANTS to give up.  But how do we decide when we're done??).  Neither of us are hard core on either side.  We're both in the ""it would be nice to have our own, and maybe we should try one more time, but also we're OK with embryo adoption as well, but are we ready to give up?"" step.  


Today, a friend of my husbands mentioned to him that her friend has four extra embryos left, and they're done having children.  She wants to have a somewhat open adoption type situation with them, which I'm totally fine with, and my husband is on the fence about (we need to find out more about the degree of involvement that she'd want).  But I've been having some trouble finding more info about embryo adoption, and it almost seems like this just fell in my lap.  I haven't seen a picture of this lady's kids yet, but DH said they looked similar to us.  



Anyways.  Obviously we need to talk to our RE more and find out more of what she thinks we should do next.  And I am just on the fence about trying again and wanting to move on to embryo adoption.  


And it's worth noting that we've made an embryo before technically.  We had an ectopic pregnancy in August, and until it ruptured, it was growing normally (doubling on schedule).  So, we've done it before...why was our first round such a fail?



Anyways, I know this was a huge novel, and that no one but us can really make a decision, but if anyone wants to chime in, I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Is there anything I'm not thinking about?  Am I being dramatic and unrealistic about IVF?  Is it fate that we were kind of offered some embryos?  Am I really hiding my frustration at having to wait 3-6 months before doing IVF again?  Arrrggg my brain hurts!  Thanks for reading!




Edit: Thank you all for all the thoughtful answers.

<p>Disclaimers- I know that this all really comes down to my husband (fuck it, I can&#39;t type out husband 100 times so I&#39;m going with DH, sorry bot) and I needing to make a decision we are both comfortable with, and no one can make that decision but us.  And, we have a WTF meeting with our RE on Wednesday, so anything I say she said was during brief phone conversations when she told us I wasn&#39;t pregnant, and we haven&#39;t had a real meeting yet.</p>

<p>SO.  I&#39;m 30, DH is 32.  We recently did our first round of IVF, antagonist protocol (I think).  I was on birth control for two full months prior to starting stims, and I had a cyst aspiration the day I started stims.  225 of Gonal F + 20 hcg for 12 days, plus cetrotide starting on Day 7.  E2 was 2128 day of trigger, 2726 the next day.  We got 22 eggs, 16 were mature, 11 fertilized, 10 made it to day 5, but all but two of them were poor quality.  We transferred one fair embryo on Day 5, and by Day 6, nothing was worth freezing.  Transfer failed.  So now we&#39;re currently left with nothing.</p>

<p>We are talking about what to do next.  I know the first round of IVF doesn&#39;t work for a lot of people but....wow, that was a major fail.  It appears to be egg quality.  Our embryos looked fine, they just didn&#39;t grow apparently.  The dr also said maybe I was over suppressed, since I stimmed for two more days and they didn&#39;t develop into blasts.</p>

<p>She said we would be getting a refund (we don&#39;t know for how much yet.  We paid $20k for a package of three transfers plus IVF, plus another $5k in meds).  My company was recently acquired and I saw that we get $5k in infertility treatments.  So, I estimate I might have ~$9-10k to go towards another round of IVF.  We&#39;re comfortable, but not millionaires by any stretch.  We could find ways to finance more treatments, but like, maybe 1-2 more rounds at the VERY most.  </p>

I may have to switch REs if she keeps talking about donor eggs after just this one attempt? I am interested in any thoughts or feedback you all might have. My partners insurance changes in the beginning of next year and we are unclear what will be covered so just want to continue.

My doctor told me that Igenomix is “scratching their heads” about the findings from the three ERA biopsies that I’ve done so far. Apparently, this has not happened to them before. Here’s a quick recap, all three ERAs were done on a hormone replacement cycle:

November 2016: First ERA comes back “post-receptive” after 5 days of progesterone. We’ve had 3 failures with PGS embryos and feel somewhat relieved to have a potential explanation. We decide to bank more embryos, but it takes us three fresh cycles to get more, so the second ERA isn’t until…

August 2017: Second ERA comes back “pre-receptive” after 4 days of progesterone with the recommendation to transfer somewhere in between days 4 and 5. Both my doctor and I feel nervous about this, so we decide to do a third ERA test after 4.5 days of progesterone.

December 2017: After weeks of waiting while Igenomix goes back and re-analyzes all three cycles and samples, they determine that I am receptive at 4.5 days of progesterone but on the “early side.” They recommended 12 more hours of progesterone (based on their standard recommendations using their giant database, not me personally). This puts me right back at 5 days of progesterone which came back as  “post-receptive” the first time around. My doctor gets their lab director on the phone who says that they analyzed my original biopsy twice using different methods, and they stand behind their results showing that I was “post-receptive” at 5 days of progesterone. Huh? My RE says they don’t have an explanation about the discrepancy.

We have decided to go ahead and do a fourth ERA at 4.8 days of progesterone (essentially 117 hours). Igenomix says they can give readings within plus or minus 3 hours of when the biopsy was taken, so this should also tell me what’s up after the standard 5 days (120 hour) mark.

There seem to be a couple of potential explanations: 

1. Igenomix screwed up somewhere, and I’ve always been receptive after 5 days of progesterone. Apparently they adjusted their algorithm for processing samples somewhere in between my first and second biopsy, but they swear this would not have affected anything.

2. I have an extremely narrow window of implantation that starts at 4.5 days of progesterone and ends at 5 days of progesterone. Doing the fourth biopsy should be able to give us more information about this possibility, but it's just hard to believe this could be the case.

GAH, I am really upset about this and feeling quite hopeless about our situation.

tl;dr Igenomix reported through the ERA test that I’m “post-receptive” at 5 days of progesterone, “pre-receptive” at 4 days of progesterone and 12 hours “pre-receptive” at 4.5 days of progesterone, with a recommendation to transfer after 5 days of progesterone.

Every day for the last year I have been second guessing whether we are doing the right thing in not yet seeing a private consultant - it would be great to get some outside perspective. 

Some background - we tried for a year and then had an ectopic pregnancy at the start of 2017, I had the tube removed. In the summer we were finally eligible to see an NHS consultant (were advised to wait and see if we could conceive again) and he did an HSG which showed no issues with my other tube; an ultrasound which showed “I would be ovulating within 48h” and a sperm analysis which showed 99% head defects. (Repeated with identical results). 

He said that ivf would be our only option unless the morphology improves, but wanted us to retest after 3m ie end December after taking vitamin supplements (folic acid and vitamins c & e) and doing a strict diet - my husband is a bit overweight but not obese. With NHS processing times and the guy going on holiday this takes us to early Feb. 

The stupid little thing that really pisses me off (selfishly haha) is that as soon as we first walked in the room in August he took one look at my face and said that he suspects my male hormones are high because of my acne, so ordered a test. So far, blunt but whatever, but the kicker is that he won’t give me the results until Feb as it’s the NHS, and he wants me to go on this strict diet as well to get my testosterone down. Even though I personally think it’s probably fine since all factors point to monthly ovulation and I have no other symptoms. So anyway, I’m sticking to this miserable diet too and losing weight despite being a healthy weight already, while my husband isn’t taking it as seriously. 

Anyway apologies for the length of this. The point is that ivf isn’t funded in our area so if things haven’t improved in Feb we will go private. But if they have improved a bit - then what? My husband says he can’t face trying naturally much longer because he thinks it may permanently kill our sex life. I don’t think he’s exaggerating. So I’m not really sure if it makes sense to wait past December, when we actually repeat the MFI test, or not? I’d be really grateful for everyone’s views. We’ve already picked out a clinic and a consultant we are happy with, and I hate the idea of doing ivf but I’ve also accepted it. 

In some ways an extra 2 months is “only” 2 months but I regret waiting so many times already, eg to start trying or to do an initial SA. I also don’t want to throw away money though if there’s no real benefit.

A few weeks ago I posted my first post here and support was great. You guys really helped through the first part of this f-ing mess (swearing was allowed right? It will happen again).

The number one advice we received was 'get a second opinion', which we did. News was better, but not much.

There is a chance to get children. This would be obtainable by beginning some high tech procedure that costs way more than we have, may cost years and that the chances are still..miniscule at best. Added to that, my wife might not be able to have kids in a few years, so by the time we saved up enough money it may be too late.

We have thought long and hard (ha) about it, and we have decided not to pursue. We have decided that we will never be having our own children (as current tech developments stand) and perhaps adopt when we are ready. It's hard, but we are getting a puppy this spring..so that's nice. 

This has been met by many of our family and friends with shock and disbelief. 'How can not having children be an option?!' and 'Why the fuck aren't you trying every fucking thing you fucking can?!' (sorry)

We have decided not to tell the results of the second opinion to anybody else, simply because hearing this shit (and explaining it) is hard.

How do others, who have chosen this path, experience this? 

How do you fill this giant gap, which you thought was your future, with things that don't feel like you are filling a gap just to fill a gap.

We have for example decided to have a puppy. We also decided we would work less. I would work a day less a week and spend more effort in boxing and saxophone lessons.  All are really nice and fun things, but they are there to fill a gap and it's tainted. 

Sorry for the rambling - I got a bit offtopic. 

Once again, thanks all. Perhaps you might downvote the living hell out of this and say 'wtf why aren't you trying everything you can you utter asshole!?' , but it was good to write this down. :)

Follistim must be refrigerated, which I can't do...so I have to take it early.

This is my first post, and I feel brave enough to speak up because I've been reading the posts on this subreddit for a few days now and you guys are brave people.

I'm (new) here to ask if others have struggled with infertility post-cancer treatment.  I finished radiation way back in 2003, and because this radiation was near my ovaries (Lymphoma spread to groin), I had a surgery to re-locate my ovaries out of the radiation field.
So without going overboard on my life story, I wanted to be bold and see if anyone out there has been through a similar situation.  I want to ask the right questions and I'm tired of feeling like I'm getting left behind.  Thank you, everyone.

After trying for more than a year, my husband and I are going in for our first IUI consultation appointment. 

I have a pretty specific question/concern. I have a very tight cervix. When I was younger, I had to have surgery to remove a number of uterine and cervical polyps. The first surgery failed because the doctor couldn’t manually dilate my cervix. In fact, the attempts to do so resulted in a puncture in my cervix. I eventually healed and had to come back and have it medically dilated (via Misoprostol) to be able to have the surgery. 

Shortly after that, I got an IUD. I told the doctor about my surgery experience. It took more than an hour for her to dilate enough for the IUD to go in. I had it for years and it was worth it in the end, but it was an unpleasant and painful experience.

But, I read reviews he runs behind and he still was throrough and I didn't feel rushed, so I'm okay with that. I mostly hope they run on time for procedures...

On to what he said...

So he said he would transfer our last embryo from the other clinic if we wanted to, but he recommended we just start over with a fresh stim cycle and do PGS since we had the 2 high quality embryos fail to implant. He said he would change my protocol a bit and use lupron instead of ganarelix because he thinks the egg quality will be better. He said since there is an obvious sperm issue and that it probably can't be fixed, we need to make sure my eggs are as perfect as possible essentially. 

At my last clinic, right before I left, I did an ERA with a natural cycle. He 1) said he really doesn't recommend/do natural cycles, so that's a bummer and 2) he said he really doesn't believe in the ERAs anymore. He said he was one of the first REs to use them in the area and has done a lot but he doesn't feel like the results were there. I've not heard most people say that so I thought that was interesting. He said he will do a mock cycle in between the ER and FET to do ""endometrial dating"" to make sure my hormone levels are correct. He wouldn't be opposed to repeating the ERA if we really wanted it though or if we had another failure with a PGS tested embryo though.

He is also going to add Lovenox to my protocol due to the recurrent implantation failure and my homo MTHFR. I'm pretty nervous about that, but was happy he took both those things seriously because my other clinic really did not seem to.

He also is going to do a 2 hour fasting glucose test which has never been brought up to me. He said he thinks I could have insulin sensitivity/mild PCOS because I got a lot of eggs but not a lot of embryos, so again, he wants to make sure my egg quality is the best it can be.

Overall, he gave us a lot of information my last clinic didn't, and really explained his methods to us instead of just telling us ""ok, so I ordered X,Y,Z"". I feel like he really has a plan for ME rather than a stock plan that is given to everyone which is how I felt about my previous cycles.

This is my second frozen embryo transfer. I'm on Gonal f (FSH) - a low dose stim cycle. 
I started on 75IU just as I did for my first FET which made it to trigger on CD14. 
My bloods on CD9 were still baseline (below 300)
My bloods on CD13 had dropped even lower than what they were. Today (CD14) I have increased the dose to 87.5

Last cycle my doctor had me begin the supplement Ubiquinol to help out with egg quality, as my FSH had been coming back a little bit high for a couple of months in a row.  I guess the theory was that the high FSH was in part due to egg quality, and that Ubiquinol could help improve the quality.

This month, FSH came back at 14 - which is still higher than we'd like, but within range to proceed with an IUI cycle by my clinic's standards. 

For this cycle, the doctor asked that I switch to the supplement DHEA - which is fine.  However, I'm wondering about something the fertility nurse stated: that I should stop the Ubiquinol, as it could interfere with the effectiveness of DHEA.

Everything I've read here and around Dr. Google seems to indicate that they are fine, and often recommended, to be taken together.  Obviously I'd like to do the best I can to improve the quality of my eggs as we go through this process.

I'm wondering if anyone in this lovely community has any experience or wisdom on the subject?

**TL;DR** - fertility nurse says DHEA and Ubiquinol should not be taken together - Internet says the opposite.  Who's right?

I've got local family (both cousins have small children..youngest is 1yr old) that ask how things are and then they're like, ""that's neat.. So my baby just started talking! Look how cute!!""

I have another cousin from CA that actually has gone to 2 of my dr appts with me where they were explaining procedure and cost.

Fuck that. I stopped using emojis in my texts and my Facebook wall is as barren as me right now.

<p>So I don&#39;t really expect or need all the attention to be on us the whole time we&#39;re doing IVF, but I did expect people to be a little more sympathetic and back the hell off a little. And then there&#39;s all the mood swings in between from hormones and I&#39;m over here feeling super overwhelmed because it feels like everyone expects all these things from me and I can&#39;t give them anything right now. Fuck that. I stopped using emojis in my texts and my Facebook wall is as barren as me right now. </p>

<p>I have my husband, my mom, my best friend, and you guys. That&#39;s more than some people have so at least I can be grateful for that.</p>

<p>tldr: 
My friends and family are super selfish and suck at sympathy. </p>

I know this is something many people here have struggled with, and I’ve read a number of archived threads about single versus double embryo transfer in general, but am hoping to get some feedback on my specific situation of having PGS normals of mediocre quality in the 36-38 age range. 

Anyone else have only fair quality PGS normals at approximately my age and how did your RE advise you? What were your major considerations in making your choice? What articles (if any) did you read to help you make your decision? 

Here are some of the articles I’ve been reading -

http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(08)00520-7/abstract (This is on whether twins are actually an undesirable outcome, compares risk profile of single twin pregnancy vs 2 singleton pregnancies, reduced IVF twin risks versus general population twin risks) 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3644132/ (This one is about how SART grading correlates to implantation/live birth in different populations (age, elective single transfer or not, etc.))

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110569015200635 (This one is kind of complicated but I take from it that we’d be candidates for a double embryo transfer, according to their criteria). 

My RE says that my chance of twins (at my age, with my embryo quality) with putting all 3 back would be 20% and higher order multiples less than 1%. But although I like him, I’m also in a shared risk program at a big for-profit clinic and so they are not going to be evaluating the risk of twins the same way I am.

My partner is not really comfortable with doing 3, but he is letting this be mostly my body/my decision. 

I had a terrible stress dream recently that all 3 took and I was completely horrified and so scared and at the same time loved them all and couldn’t imagine hoping for one not to make it, or reducing one. I think how I felt in the dream is probably similar to how I’d feel in real life. I hate the idea of putting embryos in that I’m hoping won’t make it. 

But at the same time I have a hard time imagining any of this will work anyway no matter what I do.

236,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone!

I've been lurking for a while, but after a recent conversation with my husband, we wondered if anyone was going through something similar.

In August, Mr. S and I went through our IVF cycle and ended up with 4 frozen embryos. I started estrace with my next cycle to prepare for a FET. I ended up having an LH surge along with a lining that was only about 5mm thick. So we cancelled. Fast forward to the next cycle where we went with estrace and lupron (to prevent the LH surge) and my lining just wasn't thickening. I think the highest it's been was around 5mm. We added in estrogen patches and vaginal viagra. Nothing. My lining was only 4.6mm. So we cancelled again.

We went ahead and did a hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy and found some endometritis. Thankfully this was fixable with antibiotics--but would put us at the next cycle. So we still haven't even reached the point to transfer. 

This cycle we are completely switching up the protocol. My RE said that I am one of the few women who just don't respond to artificial estrogen and my body would rather make its own.

<p>I&#39;ve been lurking for a while, but after a recent conversation with my husband, we wondered if anyone was going through something similar.</p>

<p>In August, Mr. S and I went through our IVF cycle and ended up with 4 frozen embryos. I started estrace with my next cycle to prepare for a FET. I ended up having an LH surge along with a lining that was only about 5mm thick. So we cancelled. Fast forward to the next cycle where we went with estrace and lupron (to prevent the LH surge) and my lining just wasn&#39;t thickening. I think the highest it&#39;s been was around 5mm. We added in estrogen patches and vaginal viagra. Nothing. My lining was only 4.6mm. So we cancelled again.</p>

<p>We went ahead and did a hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy and found some endometritis. Thankfully this was fixable with antibiotics--but would put us at the next cycle. So we still haven&#39;t even reached the point to transfer. </p>

<p>This cycle we are completely switching up the protocol. My RE said that I am one of the few women who just don&#39;t respond to artificial estrogen and my body would rather make its own. I had a good thick lining when on stims, she said it would have been perfect for a transfer. This week we started 125 of follistem to let my body make its own estrogen. We will adjust/add meds as needed just like we would if we were preparing for an egg retrieval. </p>

I have pharmacies across the U.S. listed, no guarantees that every pharmacy on the list will ship to your state but hopefully this research will prove useful to someone! There are 31 pharmacies listed right now with 10 more I'm in the process of getting in touch with. I'll update the sheet as I get the rest of the quotes.

A few other notes:

1. The pricing on Gonal-F at Integrity Pharmacy in AZ may be a bit lower since there is a chance my doctor has some sort of relationship them.
2. Some of the pharmacies on the list do not have relationships with the manufacturer of Gonal-F. For these pharmacies, there may only be a price for Follistim listed or a price for Follistim listed in conjunction with the Gonal-F price.
3. Try to enroll in the Compassionate Care Program if you can (https://fertilitylifelines.com/fertility-treatment-cost-options/compassionate-care-application/). In the spreadsheet I have notations for the pharmacies that accept this program. I was able to get 25% off my Gonal-F pricing (but the pricing in the spreadsheet is the price without the discount). You can get up to 75% off your Gonal-F price if you enroll in the program, depending on your income from what I understand.

These prices were collected from 12/1/17-12/2/17 and may change at any time. If they do, please don't be mad/hold me responsible. However, you can let me know and I'll gladly update them with any new information you have. :)

After 5 failed IUIs, plus a cancelled injectables cycle, then a year-long wait, no pregnancies ever, am finally in the middle of funded IVF. During monitoring I was showing 20ish follicles. At retrieval? Over 30 eggs. Day 2 result is showing 24 fertilized, most ICSI, some IVF. (All-freeze to avoid OHSS.) Going by the Hunger Games (which I've been reading religiously) and this morning's phone conversation with the embryologist, this is a) a lot, and b) while anything's possible, a sign that a lot might make it to Day 5. 

So. Prior to starting this process, my partner and I met with a genetic counselor at the RE, and learned that PGS involves paying a few hundred dollars per embryo. I'd asked during that meeting what to do if there's some absurd number of embryos, and they didn't see this as a plausible. And yet, here we are, or might be be. The total cost could be anything up to $10,000 out-of-pocket, for what is ostensibly a funded cycle. Or it could be zero, if nothing makes it to day 5, but the possibility of spending $10,000, all of a sudden (or so it feels), without any guarantee the issue isn't (say) implantation, is there, and we'll need to decide how to proceed in the day or so. 

I'm wondering whether anyone has been in a situation like this, and what you did in this case. Give a cap of how many embryos (10-12, say) to test, then freeze the rest? Make peace with having no money? Figure if there are a lot, that gives us time, and not test at all?

Thank you all for the suggestions, this has been incredibly helpful, and hopefully also helpful to others who may wind up in this boat.

So the options are back where they were: all, nothing, or picking a cap (12 maybe) and freezing the rest w/out testing. As for waiting until Day 5, this is also not possible - the clinic needs an answer on the morning of Day 5, such that when they call (which could be before 8am) we need to know how to proceed.

We have been dealing with a postponed FET due to a thin lining, we tried viagra which actually reduced the lining, but it started to bounce back.  It seems  that estrogen blood levels have stopped climbing, and now dropped off sharply, which may be part of the reason the rebound has stalled out.

The NP seems to feel this is normal fluctuation due to absorption vaginally.  My wife and I are not so sure.  We saw a drop off of nearly 75% in blood levels while shes taking the same dosage at the same time.

* CD14 1252/.75

* CD17 1582/.99

* CD19 1103/.51

* CD21 449/.35

As you can see, it built pretty regularly, but then seems to have dropped off inexplicably.  My wife is taking 2mg three times per day vaginally.  It seems that my wife's lining responds a little bit better during peak e2 during stim cycles, reaching as high as 9 or 10mm at 2500+ e2 levels.   Our doctor said normally they only need e2 to be above 200, but was willing to allow it to continue to climb if she responded well.  But we are concerned the drop off is leading to the stalled lining growth, or recovery if you will.

Today was supposed to be do or die for this months cycle, but because of t he low e2 number, and close lining numbers (7.2 homogeneous), we are going to add 2 patches to the mix, and see where that gets us by monday. 

At least at that point, we will know we've done just about everything we can, and pumped my poor wife sky high full of estrogen.  If her lining still wont respond to high e2 numbers, our next attempt will be completely different, as we will likely try a Natural FET (or simply sit one out if the numbers dont come up).

Anyway, my wife's perseverance is really astounding.  Aside from the needles and early morning appointments, shes been willing to ingest any and every hormone or medication they can throw at her, and she takes it all in stride.  I really cant say shes been moody / emotional / angry or anything out of the ordinary.  Perhaps the doctors just severely underestimate the drug metabolizing capacity of an irish liver. :)   (joking of course)

Before that, I'd like to be sure I've thoroughly thought through all the next step options, and discussed them with MrP. So I hoped I could pick all of your collective brains :)

Our diagnosis is slight MFI + unexplained/oligoovulation, although I've been ovulating normally and regularly on Clomid. I'm 37, and my AMH was 3.45 ng/mL and day 3 FSH was 5.5 uIU/mL. MrP is 44, and had variable SA results of between 5 and 19 million total motile count. We've been considered good candidates for IUI, hence six attempts. But so far, zilch.

Here's where I'm at:

**We pursue IVF here, at UCSF or another clinic.**
- Pay out of pocket. SF Bay Area has highest IVF costs in the country. Our current insurance covers $0. UCSF average cash cost is around $24K per round including meds. Most couples do at least two rounds.
- Petition MrP's employer to cover IVF in benefits package (I'm self-employed and on his insurance). Not sure about how long this will take, nor what/how much insurance will cover. Most insurers give a lifetime cap to fertility treatments.
- Get a job with better insurance, including infertility coverage (me or MrP)

**Mini-IVF or INVOcell**
Where - which clinics? Lower dose of ovarian stimulating meds, so lower cost. Also lower success rate. 

**IVF in Australia** (I'm an Aust citizen, US permanent resident)
- Pay out of pocket/private/international rate. $12-15K in Sydney, not sure of price in my hometown, where we could stay with family.
- Re-enroll in (Australian) Medicare. Requires some paperwork shuffling, including proof of residence, e.g., rental or employment contract in Australia. Around $4K/cycle. Potentially possible to pay out of my Aus superannuation fund. Note: we don't want to move permanently to Australia at this point, although we might in the next 5+ years.
- Buy private health insurance in Aust. 12 month waiting period before they'd pay out for any ART.

**IVF elsewhere in the US**
- Shop around for cheaper clinics, + travel/accom. New Directions in Phoenix is $5K+ meds

**IVF elsewhere in the world**
Mexico, Greece, Czech, etc. $3Kish + travel/accom, etc.

**Keep doing IUIs** sigh. This really doesn't appeal at this point. And I've taken a fair amount of Clomid.

**Stop treatment, try to conceive naturally** for a year? two? the rest of our reproductive lives? Stress, higher potential of genetic anomalies as we age, etc.

**Stop treatment, ask my twin sister to be our surrogate/egg donor.** (she's offered in the past). Home AI or IUI?

**Stop treatment, stop trying.** Live childfree. Pursue adoption/other. Obviously, this is its own big can of worms, and a very personal decision for us to make.

ETA: Thank you all for your suggestions! I obviously took you up on many of them!! :) 

* 11 y.o. niece: [This book](http://www.oprah.com/gift/oprahs-favorite-things-2017-full-list-letters-to-me-when-i-grow-up?editors_pick_id=71355) from Oprah's Favorite Things list and some fun colored gel pens. I loved journaling and thinking about the future when I was her age.

* Husband: [Cologne sampler.](https://sephora.com/product/cologne-sampler-P423555?icid2=skugrid) He likes cologne, and the small sizes come in handy when he travels. He also needs a new dopp kit bag, so this is perfect. BTW, Sephora rewards members (free to sign up!) can get $15 off in store/online using the code 2017reward.

* BIL: He drives around a lot for work, so I always get him a gift card to Chipotle or Subway so he can grab a few lunches. It's not fancy, but I know it's appreciated.

* 6 y.o. nephew: Despicable Me minions [Operation game](https://www.target.com/p/operation-despicable-me-board-game/-/A-51319059#lnk=sametab) and [Mini Hatchimals](https://www.target.com/p/hatchimals-colleggtibles-4pk-bonus-by-spin-master-styles-colors-may-vary/-/A-52124761?lnk=rec|adaptpdph1|related_prods_vv|adaptpdph1|52124761|1) (does anyone know if these are still ""cool?""). 

* 13 y.o. nephew: [Exploding Kittens](https://www.target.com/p/exploding-kittens-game/-/A-26396662#lnk=sametab) card game. The video on their [website](http://explodingkittens.com) sold me :)

I need suggestions for:

* 40 y.o. sisters: [Mizon sheet face masks](https://www.amazon.com/MIZON-Enjoy-Vital-Up-Sheet-Variety/dp/B01HCHA7CY/ref=pd_sim_194_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=P1Z41257M5HY7PH09R4W), and I'm not sure what else. They're into typical ""girly"" things, like perfume and wine and makeup, but one of them is also super picky. 

* My mom. She's older, from another country, and not really interested in activities, events, or hobbies. She gardens, but she likes to buy her own stuff. However, I don't want to get her a gift card. I'm considering a spa day when she comes to visit.

I'm not sure about the rest of you, but dealing with infertility is the most isolating thing I've experienced. I can't relate with my friends who have kids or are pregnant and I certainly can't bring this up with my friends who are CF or single and free-wheeling.  My own sister feels off limits because she just hasn't had this issue, but worst of all, my husband is becoming difficult about it.

277,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello everyone. I recently joined reddit and this group but I’ve been reading it (and some other TTC subreddits) for a few months. While the process of TTC has been a difficult one, it really has helped to hear from a lot of people here who are going through it too. Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and wealth of knowledge. It’s been so helpful. :)

Background Info: I’m a 30F (husband is 31M) and we’re both research scientists in biotech. We’ve been married for 5 years and decided to start TTC in January 2017. We’re now 11 cycles in and no sign of a BFP, no sign of miscarriage. I’m very slightly underweight and I always get monthly periods, though they do vary in length by ~3-5 days per month. I have a clean bill of health from my PCP. I’ve done several months of OPKs (the blinking smiley ones, which yielded results that matched the phone app I’m using) and we’ve timed sex with these tests as well as cervical mucus. No luck so far! (and as a scientist, I'm super obsessed with details and optimizing things...)

The first few months were OK in terms of my attitude/optimism but I’d say since around the 6 month mark I started feeling pretty down. I don’t take pregnancy tests anymore (since probably the 4 month mark). It seems like as soon as everyone turned 30, social media exploded with pregnancy and birth announcements. My husband and I have been together for over 10 years and people have been wondering/saying ‘you’re next.’ Little do they know how hard we’ve been trying! Additionally, my work environment is fantastic and wonderfully supportive of work-life balance and having families. The downside is that there are a lot of pregnant women at all times—a constant reminder of our lack of success. The good side of all of it is, I’ve been very fortunate that my husband is incredibly supportive and we’re still doing great. While my family is very supportive and close-knit, my husband and I don’t really feel comfortable discussing this situation with them or any of our friends so this whole thing has been incredibly isolating.

My questions: 
I know everyone says you need to wait 1 year to be seen by a doctor. I saw my PCP 3 months ago (I was at the 8 cycle mark) and she seemed completely unconcerned and said to contact an OB sometime in the winter if no BFP (she wasn't very helpful and didn't have much info to offer). I’ve never seen an OB/GYN before because my PCP always does my pap etc. and I’ve never had cause for concern. When I was younger (more underweight) my periods were more irregular so I thought I was doing pretty well these days in terms of my cycle (but maybe not!).

I was thinking of contacting an OB soon for an appointment. I presume you need to see an OB before you see an RE? What requirements might they have before referring you to an RE? I feel like I have a tendency to have my concerns brushed aside by doctors so I wondered if anyone had any advice on solid things to say/info to provide that might get things moving along?

I'm coming up on my two year anniversary of trying and have come to a bit of a dead end in terms of trying to identify why I am unable to conceive. I guess that's why it's called unexplained infertility :) But my obsessive mind just can't accept that there is no identifiable reason why it isn't working!

Some background details
-28 years old - partner is 38 
-partner originally had a lower sperm count, but this was retested after months of fertility supplements, and is well into the normal range on all counts
-regular 3 day long periods - 25 day cycle with a luteal phase of at least 10 days
-internal scan and hysterosalpingogram all clear
-confirmed ovulation every month through temping
-two cycles of Clomid - one at 50mg (produced 7 follicles - not allowed to try) and one at 25mg (produced 3 follicles - not supposed to try, but very tempted!) 
- uterine lining appears normal 
-never knowingly been pregnant - no MCs, CPs 

Potential issues
-I typically have spotting from days 21-25 before my period - this has decreased thanks to acupuncture, but still comes up from time to time
-post ovulation blood tests have tested a little low for progesterone. I have asked the fertility specialist (UK) if I can take progesterone supplements, but this apparently is not offered on the NHS. 

I've been referred back to the fertility specialist to discuss the next steps in my treatment. I am concerned about what he is going to suggest, as he did not listen to my concerns about taking Clomid (i.e. why take it if I am already ovulating). At our last appointment, he said my other option would be NHS-funded IVF. I am reticent to start IVF without a slightly better idea of what the actual issue is, as it may be that there is still a simple solution, e.g. progesterone. 

Does anyone from the UK have experience getting progesterone supplements? 
Or does anyone have any ideas of issues that I may have missed and might be affecting me? Or tests that it would be worth doing before IVF? 

Thanks so much - I hate that we are all in this club together, but reading all of your posts makes this situation a little more bearable.

288,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"First of all, I have to say thank you to all of you.  I've been stalking Reddit for a few months now and this forum is what's been keeping me sane.  IF is not something you talk about with your friends, and it is so good to know I am not alone in this, because it gets lonely.  And when I was freaking about my HSG, your posts reassured me it wasn't a big deal...and it wasn't.  
Anyhow...full story, because it's time I get this off my chest and introduce myself.  Husband and I have been trying about a year and half. I'm 29, never pregnant, gluten intolerant. Just had my third RE appt today with the grand reveal of ""what's wrong with me"".  (Husband's SA at first appointment was totally normal). 2 weeks ago I had the HSG, sono, and endometrial biopsy done (yup...all in one day).  Biopsy showed that I have chronic endometritis (CE)...not be confused with endometriosis.  So starting 2 weeks of antibiotics for that in the morning. That's looking like a promising diagnosis since it looks like antibiotics clear it up 90% of the time. But then he said I also have PCOS.  High AMH, borderline high testosterone, acne issues, weak ovulation as per low progesterone levels day 21.  No cysts on my ovaries as per the sono which is a good thing. I am only 124 pounds, so it was a bit of a surprise to be in the 20% or so of ""lean"" PCOS ladies.  And considering my periods are usually on time to within a day and not that heavy.  Then we talked about my HSG, which showed that my tubes are open (yay!) but that my left one is ""abnormal""...scarred or has a cyst.  Basically we need to do a laparoscopy for a conclusive answer.  And ideally do it when it's time to re-biopsy to check in the endometritis cleared up so I can get it all done at once.  
Needless to say, its a lot to take in. The lap terrifies me and I want to cancel it (it's on the schedule for January).  I had my wisdom teeth out in college and didn't come out of anesthesia well.  Swore I was never doing it again, and here I am looking at an even more invasive, intense procedure.  To add to the list, I found out last year I'm allergic to lidocaine.  And the year before that I found out I'm allergic to amoxicillin.  Both useful surgical drugs that I've had several times since my youth for minor stuff and not had reactions to before. So in my head I'm freaking out a bit about having a reaction to something else while I'm on the table. 
 Which leads me to wonder how far down this path I'm willing to go for a child.  After the lap, what's next? Assuming they can even do anything about what's in there.  Drugs for the PCOS?  Then more fertility drugs?  Then are we looking at IUI or IVF?  My husband and I are both carriers for cystic fibrosis by the way, so even if I can get pregnant, 25% chance of a child with CF.  I have 2 cousins with the disease...I don't want that for my child but the only way to rule it out is IVF.  I have read many of your stories and I don't think I can handle the roller coaster of emotions with IVF.  I just never thought this would be our journey to get pregnant.  Its just starting to sink in of just how much I'm going to have to commit to go down this road. By the way, I'm a horse trainer running a farm.  I ride an average of 4 to 5 horses a day, mostly ones with some kind of behavior issue.  Not good ones to ride with a delicate pregnancy.  Asked doc about it today and he said point blank that if I do fertility drugs down the road I shouldn't ride until baby is born. So then I start thinking, can I really take off 9 months when I do get pregnant?  Just taking the week off for the lap is going to be hard.  I have to hire someone to do the barn work.  I should be able to teach as soon as I have my mental capacity, right? 
I guess my questions to all of you veterans out there are: 
How long did you take off after laproscopy?  Did anyone regret doing it or was it worth it for the answers and/or what they could fix?
Any other horse trainers/riders out there with IF?  How are managing taking off work?  Did you tell your clients you are taking off for fertility issues or what was your excuse?  If I do this I'm going to need an excuse.  I don't really want everyone knowing we are having issues, especially since only my mom and my sister even know we've been trying and we just told them. 
 Are my doubts normal or are they a sign that I should not be going down this path? Especially with our risk of having a baby with CF?  
 Oh, and are there advantages to knowing more via the lap beyond just fertility reasons?  I've been reading stories about endoMETRIOSIS and that sounds like it would be nice to rule out for my own sake.  Celiac symptoms that I've been having seem to be linked to it, etc. 
Thanks for reading if you made it through all this.  Just needed to get it all out. I hope my doubts don't offend anyone.

I don&#39;t really want everyone knowing we are having issues, especially since only my mom and my sister even know we&#39;ve been trying and we just told them. 
 Are my doubts normal or are they a sign that I should not be going down this path? Especially with our risk of having a baby with CF?<br/>
 Oh, and are there advantages to knowing more via the lap beyond just fertility reasons?  I&#39;ve been reading stories about endoMETRIOSIS and that sounds like it would be nice to rule out for my own sake.  Celiac symptoms that I&#39;ve been having seem to be linked to it, etc. 
Thanks for reading if you made it through all this.  Just needed to get it all out. I hope my doubts don&#39;t offend anyone.  I know some of you are facing so much worse and will do anything for a child.  I&#39;m just trying to process this, and trust me, my own tears are being shed.</p>
