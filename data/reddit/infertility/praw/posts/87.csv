1,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"There's quite a bit of content below so read on if you are interested, but I thought I would share our experiences of traveling to Greece in 2019 for IVF treatment. We are living in the U.S. part-time in two different cities and this was the option we landed on for a variety of reasons.....

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I am a 36 year old female with unexplained infertility using male partner sperm (husband) who has no MFI. No known PCOS or endo. We did multiple IUI’s, stimulated cycles and patience over 2+ years. We’ve had genetic testing with no real issues but no karyotyping. 

My husband and I travel quite a bit for work and personally. We also split our time between two cities in the U.S. When we finally started down the IVF path, we realized that we weren’t particularly happy with our physicians in our original city or the secondary one so we started to explore other options. We looked at things like CNY, another place in Arizona and another in Colorado. Many of these places were not particularly cooperative with our needs — for example, the location in Arizona wanted us to have a ton of re-testing for diagnostic purposes done by their clinic which required travel in advance of the IVF-specific travel. It felt unnecessary and duplicative. CNY indicated they had wait list for a consultation far beyond our preferences. In the end, we stumbled upon options for IVF abroad in Europe and figured that if we were going to travel and have plane & hotel expenses, it may be worth it to explore travel that was a little farther, but potentially far more cost effective than the U.S.

I’m aware that there are opportunities to travel for IVF in the Caribbean, Madrid, Prague, Greece, Cyprus and likely many other places not even on my radar. We ruled out the Caribbean (being conservative on Zika) and narrowed it down to Madrid, Prague and Greece. We have spent quite a bit of time in Madrid, I also adore Prague and we did our honeymoon in Greece so felt all would be comfortable “enough.” 

**Deciding on a Clinic**

For us, we had been through rounds of doctors and really wanted to feel good about the clinic. We were especially skeptical because it was a foreign location. The clinics in Madrid were far less responsive than those in Greece and Prague so we ended up setting up three consultations: 2 with clinics in/near Prague, 1 with a clinic in Greece. I thought for sure we’d choose Prague and had read extensively about their IVF tourism from the UK.

One thing I’ll note here is that I recommend a fair amount of research regarding how laws vary from country to country which seems obvious, but some of it is more nuanced. More on that later.

Overall, as far as I know, the majority of well-known European clinics are overseen by the the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. They are heavily regulated and have all the same, if not better technologies. Secondarily, they cost WAY less in some of these countries, especially the drugs. We ended up putting a cost comparison in a spreadsheet which is not a perfect science because you are estimating travel and drugs and each clinic structures prices differently. We determined that it was definitely cheaper abroad, but that it was like immaterially different in price across these three clinics.

$$ including travel & drug estimates

**Clinic 1 (Prague)** \- $8000 w/o PGS | $9500k w/ PGS (including travel)

**Clinic 2 (Prague)** \- $10-11k w/o PGS | $12.5k w/PGS (including travel)

**Clinic 3 (Greece)** \- $7500 w/o PGS | $9200 w/ PGS (including travel)

**Clinic US home comparison** \- $14k w/o PGS | $16.5k w/PGS (no travel needed)

**Other clinic within US** \- $12k w/o PGS | $15.5k w/ PGS (includes travel estimates)

We had our consultations in order of above. I was honestly convinced that I would pick a clinic in Prague as I had my own pre-disposed thoughts for a variety of reasons. All of the clinics are tremendously professional, link you up with an international coordinator who speaks English, the physicians speak English and you send them a load of information, labs, etc. before even having the consult.

With the first clinic, the physician was perfectly cordial and knowledgable. He brought up things apparent in my lab values that not a single one of my (MANY) U.S. physicians had which led to additional testing and ruling out potential issues. He also was very… robotic and clinical. It definitely felt a bit cold and I recognize there is a cultural component that plays into things. I felt comfortable that everything would run smoothly and effectively, however.

The second clinic was similar to the first, but I felt that they were a bit less responsive regarding my questions and needs and perhaps just slightly less “coordinated.” 

The third clinic in Greece was hands down my favorite interaction. Our Skype was with both our international coordinator and physician and both were so warm and nice and my husband and I instantly felt comfortable. They two brought up numerous observations from my labs that others hadn’t. They seemed well organized. When we got off the phone, I noted that it was the first clinic in all that we had “been” to (including U.S.) where I felt more positive and excited about the process. In the end, my husband felt the decision was mine and that we should move forward.

**Logistics and moving forward**

Once you’ve agreed to move forward, there is naturally a lot of paperwork. Consents which are provided in Greek & English. Documents outlining what tests need to be performed in advance. I had recently switched OB/GYNs and my new one was more than willing to facilitate any testing I needed. I would go pick up the documents and scan them to my doctors in Greece which, at times, felt like an extra step but I wasn’t terribly bothered by it. You communicate mostly by e-mail and the occasional Skype meeting and obviously have some pauses due to the time change. The clinic was very good about inquiring when we needed the timing to be and they aligned BCP suppression to work with our schedule. You are assigned a nurse midwife who coordinates all your medication schedules with the doctor. They send you explicit emails regarding what to take when and its very clearly laid out. They are also very responsive regarding any questions.

As far as logistics for being on-site for the retrieval process. We originally thought we’d be there approximately 12 days and have our first scan and some of our stims start in the U.S. But there was an issue with the international pharmacy that they usually utilize and I have seen on reddit recently some regulation changes that may be impacting this. I personally wanted to do the whole process in Greece and not try to coordinate with my physician here, but this was harder for my husband because his job flexibility is less than mine. He wanted to be there for the whole process which now required 18-20 days. While I normally would have been comfortable going alone, this felt a little more intimidating as Thessaloniki was not a city I’ve been to previously and it all felt a bit scary for me. In the end, he was able to make the schedule work and we were in Greece for 16 days. It would have been longer had we been able to have a fresh transfer, but this was not an option for us so we departed a few days early and had a mini-vacation in Austria last minute. All in all, we were in the EU for 22 days, but this was added cushion we built in and not required.

Additionally, my husband worked remotely from Greece. He would spend the mornings with me and then start working around 4PM to align with his office in the U.S. and sometimes work until 1AM. We obviously have quite a bit of flexibility, but this was also very draining for him. He was more than willing to do it to be present for the process, but I don’t know that everyone would be so relaxed about the situation. I’m very lucky to have someone so “chill.”

**Travel & Lodging**

We used a series of three Airbnb reservations. We did this because we didn’t want to be locked into one location for the entire stay if we did not like it, it allowed us to stay in different areas of the city and we chose properties with looser cancelation terms so that if the fresh transfer was not possible, we could switch our travel plans accordingly and not pay for additional lodging unneeded. I will also add that due to our significant work and personal travel, from a flight perspective we have access to may perks and “status” to make 24-hour flight changes, etc. without penalty. We did not, however, use miles to fly here, but obviously that is a great option. We also rented a rental car. It was manual as the automatic was slightly less cost effective but also required my husband to drive entirely. There is no Uber or Lyft in Thessaloniki. There are taxis, but they’re not terribly convenient unless you are in certain parts of the city. The city is tremendously walkable, has AMAZING history and waterfront views. The dining scene is great. The shopping is adequate. The coffee is superb. 

The other thing to note is that flights are not TERRIBLY convenient here. Right now, from the U.S., you are looking at 3 flights to get to Thessaloniki, most likely, depending on your city. We would use miles to buy a round trip ticket to NYC. Then we’d buy a roundtrip or multi-city to Europe and then direct flights from there to Thessaloniki. It doesn’t necessarily have to be that complicated, but we were going for the most cost effective options. When we could wrap in a weekend and see another part of Europe, we took advantage of it. 

For example, our retrieval, we flew out on a Friday to Frankfurt from NYC. We stayed overnight and did a little mini road trip down the Rhine and to Heidelberg then flew out of Frankfurt direct to Thessaloniki on a Sunday. Monday, we hiked Mt. Olympus and oriented to the city Monday/Tuesday and weren’t actually due at the clinic until Wednesday. Returning, we gained about 5 days from not doing the fresh transfer so we re-routed to Zurich, drove to Austria, stayed in the middle of the Alps at a spa and decompressed, then drove to Frankfurt and flew back to NYC. Many people would find all of this stressful, but we quite enjoyed it.

For our 1st FET, we flew to Amsterdam on a Friday, stayed a few days, flew to Thessaloniki direct, were there for 4-5 days (more than was actually required which is 3 total) then flew to Rome for a night and then back to NYC. Our NYC -> Amsterdam, Rome -> NYC ticket was $662/pp which is quite affordable. Recently, I’ve also learned that Thessaloniki is expanding their airport to have more direct flights from the U.S. and Europe.

**The Clinic**

I’ll elaborate on our first few days adjusting to Thessaloniki, but a few days after our arrival, we were due at the clinic. We used Google Maps and drove over, there was ample parking and signage in English and waited in the Lobby for our appointment. Our international coordinator came out to greet us with open arms, was so inviting and welcoming and the clinic itself was bright, clean and refreshing. Honestly, once we had those first 15 minutes of being inside and meeting our coordinator in person, I felt SO MUCH more at ease. You obviously don’t know exactly what you’re walking in to so I was a bit nervous prior. We were then walked back to the doctor’s office where you meet him and the Nurse Midwives who help coordinate everything. Our doctor is wonderful and very sweet so we always catch up and exchange pleasantries and talk about cultural differences, etc. Your US scans are done in his office behind a curtain and my husband is on the other side. It feels a bit different than the U.S. In general, they are way less uptight than in the U.S. so the first time they told me to go behind the curtain for my ultrasound, my international coordinator stood there with me while I undressed and got on the table. This was at first, unsettling, but once you get used to the fact that they are just less uptight and more open, it doesn’t seem to phase you after awhile and I’m rather conservative regarding that stuff. Each day you come in, they take your labs, do a scan and then talk with the physician about your progress. Your dosages are adjusted every 2-3 days to account for progress/non-progress. I was being closely monitored due to the fact that I have a lot of follicles and we were hoping for a fresh transfer. I don’t know what others have experienced in the U.S. but my therapist (U.S. based) felt that the way they monitored and tweaked the protocol seemed more attentive than some cycles in the U.S. Each day, the doctor would hand write our instructions of what drugs and when and then they’d give us an Rx for any drugs we didn’t already have. Toward the end of the cycle, he even asked how much Gonal-f I had left and then tweaked my protocol to not require me to buy additional vials which would have waste. 

**The Retrieval & FET**

As I indicated above, there is not quite the level of privacy you might see in U.S. clinics. You get undressed waist down with your own bed in a room full of similar little “pods” and wait your turn for both your retrieval or transfer. Everything is clean and sterile, it just feels a little more intimate here. Your partner is not allowed in this area and you do it alone while they wait upstairs. My international coordinator did accompany to my transfer and it was very nice to have her. In general, the anesthesiologist, definitely all doctors and many of the nurses speak English well. In the event they don’t, they make sure someone is with you who does at all times and they translate always what they are saying in Greek. I also felt many of the other women there were very warm and sweet and appreciated the coziness as it made me feel less alone. It’s hard for me to compare the process to how clinics in the U.S. might handle things as I have not had any IVF rounds in the U.S.

**The Medications**

One of my biggest selling points for doing IVF in Greece is absolutely the medications. Medications in Greece were astronomically cheaper than in the U.S. For BCP suppression prior to stims and being on-site, the clinic coordinated me obtaining from my U.S. OB/GYN. Once arrived, they had me on an antagonist protocol and coordinated a prescription of Gonal-f, Ganirelix and HCG trigger shot. My total medication costs for stims were roughly $800. All were made by the same companies as the U.S., packaged almost identically only in Greek. The clinic gave me the address of a Pharmacy which normally had ample supply and we used them for every purchase and trip to Greece so far. The pharmacist is SOOOOOO nice, gave us his card to contact him after hours for any emergencies or concerns and was very sweet and professional. We also had to purchase things like Heparin shots and progesterone pessaries, etc.

For the FET, they had sent me home from the retrieval with adequate supplies of injectable Progesterone. This is what I LOVED most. Progesterone in Greece is in an aqueous solution not yet available in the U.S. so the shots are subcutaneous in the belly with a small insulin needle. You can also request vaginal pessaries in place of it, but I opted for the injections. There is no need for progesterone in oil, no intramuscular shots, etc. Such a win!

I think one box of Progesterone 25ml shots for 7 days was somewhere between $30-$50. After the FET, they actually sent us back to the Pharmacy to obtain our medications for the entirety of 10 weeks of injections/treatments we would need should the transfer be successful. In totality, we purchased 10 weeks of injectable Progesterone, 10 weeks of vaginal progesterone pessaries (they put me on a combination of one shot per day and 2 vaginal pessaries) and 10 weeks of Cyclacur (estrogen similar to Estrace 2 pills 2x per day). The total bill for all of these drugs was $700-800. In totality, for the stims, pre-FET and 10 weeks of post-FET injectables, pills, etc., our cost for medications was no more than $2000. I see this as a huge win.

**Overall Results**

I won’t go into our specifics except to note our embryo information: We had 30 follicles with 21 eggs. 14 eggs were mature, 12 embryos fertilized with ICSI and 10 made it to Day 5 blastocyst. We were very happy with these results. Our first FET, we transferred two 5A embryos.

**Other Thoughts/Comments**

We’ve found our experience with our Greek clinic to be tremendously positive. That being said, there were a lot of road bumps and stressors along the way and I think its important to be candid about them:

1. Thessaloniki is a city that requires adjustment from the U.S. The first night we stayed there, we didn’t love our Airbnb, were overwhelmed, scared and both of us didn’t want to say it but laid awake all night wondering if we made a mistake. Once we felt more comfortable, got to know the city and had our first appointment with the clinic, all of these fears were entirely diminished.
2. YOUR EMBRYOS ARE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY HALF WAY ACROSS THE WORLD. This is fine with us, but its also something to wrap your mind around. You can’t just hop over and grab them. I believe ours are in good hands and our annual cryopreservation fees are \~$250.
3. We had hoped to do PGS testing on all of our embryos because it is very affordable in Greece and we were in the belief that we should have the best information available. We learned after we were there that PGS testing in Greece is heavily regulated and you have to meet certain risk factors that your doctor must certify in order to qualify. This is somewhere I fell short on research and was disappointed in myself. Our doctor was very good in talking us through it, but its something you’d want to discuss upfront as its obviously a big deal. Other people may very well meet the requirements. We didn’t have history of recurrent miscarriage and I was 35 at the time and those were the big things that ruled us out.
4. EVERYONE IN GREECE SMOKES. Its mildly to moderately annoying. It was an issue for us, but we made sure to consider it when choosing to eat outside and also cooked at our Airbnb quite a bit. Conversely, the food is amazing. This was something we learned to deal with but we’re not thrilled about.
5. The clinic sometimes operated on a need to know basis. They rarely gave us too much information, sometimes it felt sparse. If I asked, they would answer my questions thoroughly, but post-FET I had to follow-up as they only wanted to give instructions one step at a time and when you’re coordinating care here in the U.S. I needed a little bit of pre-planning. Again, I think the takeaway is just to ask as many questions as you want because they are more than accommodating. 
6. I’m not sure about Greece’s same sex partner laws, but I believe there are some nuances to it. I know they also do egg donation and its quite accessible. 
7. We were able to see some amazing sites and road trips during our stay and I see that as a huge perk. 

Total spent (non-travel): $5,800

Flights & Airbnb (myself and partner, retrieval and first FET): $4500-ish. Could be done cheaper. Then there’s meals and all the other splurges we did, but we also spent a total of 3.5 weeks in Greece.

It was manual as the automatic was slightly less cost effective but also required my husband to drive entirely. There is no Uber or Lyft in Thessaloniki. There are taxis, but they’re not terribly convenient unless you are in certain parts of the city. The city is tremendously walkable, has AMAZING history and waterfront views. The dining scene is great. The shopping is adequate. The coffee is superb. </p>

<p>The other thing to note is that flights are not TERRIBLY convenient here. Right now, from the U.S., you are looking at 3 flights to get to Thessaloniki, most likely, depending on your city. We would use miles to buy a round trip ticket to NYC. Then we’d buy a roundtrip or multi-city to Europe and then direct flights from there to Thessaloniki. It doesn’t necessarily have to be that complicated, but we were going for the most cost effective options. When we could wrap in a weekend and see another part of Europe, we took advantage of it. </p>

<p>For example, our retrieval, we flew out on a Friday to Frankfurt from NYC. We stayed overnight and did a little mini road trip down the Rhine and to Heidelberg then flew out of Frankfurt direct to Thessaloniki on a Sunday. Monday, we hiked Mt. Olympus and oriented to the city Monday/Tuesday and weren’t actually due at the clinic until Wednesday. Returning, we gained about 5 days from not doing the fresh transfer so we re-routed to Zurich, drove to Austria, stayed in the middle of the Alps at a spa and decompressed, then drove to Frankfurt and flew back to NYC. Many people would find all of this stressful, but we quite enjoyed it.</p>

<p>For our 1st FET, we flew to Amsterdam on a Friday, stayed a few days, flew to Thessaloniki direct, were there for 4-5 days (more than was actually required which is 3 total) then flew to Rome for a night and then back to NYC. Our NYC -&gt; Amsterdam, Rome -&gt; NYC ticket was $662/pp which is quite affordable. Recently, I’ve also learned that Thessaloniki is expanding their airport to have more direct flights from the U.S. and Europe.</p>

<p><strong>The Clinic</strong></p>

<p>I’ll elaborate on our first few days adjusting to Thessaloniki, but a few days after our arrival, we were due at the clinic. We used Google Maps and drove over, there was ample parking and signage in English and waited in the Lobby for our appointment. Our international coordinator came out to greet us with open arms, was so inviting and welcoming and the clinic itself was bright, clean and refreshing. Honestly, once we had those first 15 minutes of being inside and meeting our coordinator in person, I felt SO MUCH more at ease. You obviously don’t know exactly what you’re walking in to so I was a bit nervous prior. We were then walked back to the doctor’s office where you meet him and the Nurse Midwives who help coordinate everything. Our doctor is wonderful and very sweet so we always catch up and exchange pleasantries and talk about cultural differences, etc. Your US scans are done in his office behind a curtain and my husband is on the other side. It feels a bit different than the U.S. In general, they are way less uptight than in the U.S. so the first time they told me to go behind the curtain for my ultrasound, my international coordinator stood there with me while I undressed and got on the table. This was at first, unsettling, but once you get used to the fact that they are just less uptight and more open, it doesn’t seem to phase you after awhile and I’m rather conservative regarding that stuff. Each day you come in, they take your labs, do a scan and then talk with the physician about your progress. Your dosages are adjusted every 2-3 days to account for progress/non-progress. I was being closely monitored due to the fact that I have a lot of follicles and we were hoping for a fresh transfer. I don’t know what others have experienced in the U.S. but my therapist (U.S. based) felt that the way they monitored and tweaked the protocol seemed more attentive than some cycles in the U.S. Each day, the doctor would hand write our instructions of what drugs and when and then they’d give us an Rx for any drugs we didn’t already have. Toward the end of the cycle, he even asked how much Gonal-f I had left and then tweaked my protocol to not require me to buy additional vials which would have waste. </p>

<p><strong>The Retrieval &amp; FET</strong></p>

<p>As I indicated above, there is not quite the level of privacy you might see in U.S. clinics. You get undressed waist down with your own bed in a room full of similar little “pods” and wait your turn for both your retrieval or transfer. Everything is clean and sterile, it just feels a little more intimate here. Your partner is not allowed in this area and you do it alone while they wait upstairs. My international coordinator did accompany to my transfer and it was very nice to have her. In general, the anesthesiologist, definitely all doctors and many of the nurses speak English well. In the event they don’t, they make sure someone is with you who does at all times and they translate always what they are saying in Greek. I also felt many of the other women there were very warm and sweet and appreciated the coziness as it made me feel less alone. It’s hard for me to compare the process to how clinics in the U.S. might handle things as I have not had any IVF rounds in the U.S.</p>

<p><strong>The Medications</strong></p>

<p>One of my biggest selling points for doing IVF in Greece is absolutely the medications. Medications in Greece were astronomically cheaper than in the U.S. For BCP suppression prior to stims and being on-site, the clinic coordinated me obtaining from my U.S. OB/GYN. Once arrived, they had me on an antagonist protocol and coordinated a prescription of Gonal-f, Ganirelix and HCG trigger shot. My total medication costs for stims were roughly $800. All were made by the same companies as the U.S., packaged almost identically only in Greek. The clinic gave me the address of a Pharmacy which normally had ample supply and we used them for every purchase and trip to Greece so far. The pharmacist is SOOOOOO nice, gave us his card to contact him after hours for any emergencies or concerns and was very sweet and professional. We also had to purchase things like Heparin shots and progesterone pessaries, etc.</p>

<p>For the FET, they had sent me home from the retrieval with adequate supplies of injectable Progesterone. This is what I LOVED most. Progesterone in Greece is in an aqueous solution not yet available in the U.S. so the shots are subcutaneous in the belly with a small insulin needle. You can also request vaginal pessaries in place of it, but I opted for the injections. There is no need for progesterone in oil, no intramuscular shots, etc. Such a win!</p>

<p>I think one box of Progesterone 25ml shots for 7 days was somewhere between $30-$50. After the FET, they actually sent us back to the Pharmacy to obtain our medications for the entirety of 10 weeks of injections/treatments we would need should the transfer be successful. In totality, we purchased 10 weeks of injectable Progesterone, 10 weeks of vaginal progesterone pessaries (they put me on a combination of one shot per day and 2 vaginal pessaries) and 10 weeks of Cyclacur (estrogen similar to Estrace 2 pills 2x per day). The total bill for all of these drugs was $700-800. In totality, for the stims, pre-FET and 10 weeks of post-FET injectables, pills, etc., our cost for medications was no more than $2000. I see this as a huge win.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Results</strong></p>

<p>I won’t go into our specifics except to note our embryo information: We had 30 follicles with 21 eggs. 14 eggs were mature, 12 embryos fertilized with ICSI and 10 made it to Day 5 blastocyst. We were very happy with these results. Our first FET, we transferred two 5A embryos.</p>

<p><strong>Other Thoughts/Comments</strong></p>

<p>We’ve found our experience with our Greek clinic to be tremendously positive. That being said, there were a lot of road bumps and stressors along the way and I think its important to be candid about them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Thessaloniki is a city that requires adjustment from the U.S. The first night we stayed there, we didn’t love our Airbnb, were overwhelmed, scared and both of us didn’t want to say it but laid awake all night wondering if we made a mistake. Once we felt more comfortable, got to know the city and had our first appointment with the clinic, all of these fears were entirely diminished.</li>
<li>YOUR EMBRYOS ARE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY HALF WAY ACROSS THE WORLD. This is fine with us, but its also something to wrap your mind around. You can’t just hop over and grab them. I believe ours are in good hands and our annual cryopreservation fees are ~$250.</li>
<li>We had hoped to do PGS testing on all of our embryos because it is very affordable in Greece and we were in the belief that we should have the best information available. We learned after we were there that PGS testing in Greece is heavily regulated and you have to meet certain risk factors that your doctor must certify in order to qualify. This is somewhere I fell short on research and was disappointed in myself. Our doctor was very good in talking us through it, but its something you’d want to discuss upfront as its obviously a big deal. Other people may very well meet the requirements. We didn’t have history of recurrent miscarriage and I was 35 at the time and those were the big things that ruled us out.</li>
<li>EVERYONE IN GREECE SMOKES. Its mildly to moderately annoying. It was an issue for us, but we made sure to consider it when choosing to eat outside and also cooked at our Airbnb quite a bit. Conversely, the food is amazing. This was something we learned to deal with but we’re not thrilled about.</li>
<li>The clinic sometimes operated on a need to know basis. They rarely gave us too much information, sometimes it felt sparse. If I asked, they would answer my questions thoroughly, but post-FET I had to follow-up as they only wanted to give instructions one step at a time and when you’re coordinating care here in the U.S. I needed a little bit of pre-planning. Again, I think the takeaway is just to ask as many questions as you want because they are more than accommodating. </li>
<li>I’m not sure about Greece’s same sex partner laws, but I believe there are some nuances to it. I know they also do egg donation and its quite accessible. </li>
<li>We were able to see some amazing sites and road trips during our stay and I see that as a huge perk. </li>
</ol>

<p>Total spent (non-travel): $5,800</p>

<p>Flights &amp; Airbnb (myself and partner, retrieval and first FET): $4500-ish. Could be done cheaper. Then there’s meals and all the other splurges we did, but we also spent a total of 3.5 weeks in Greece.</p>

<p>TL;DR We are very happy with our experiences to date with treatment in Greece. We feel that they treat us with professionally and are getting wonderful care.</p>

I feel so alone and so isolated. Infertility and loss is such a fucking asshole. I don’t know how we keep going after this. I know others have it a lot worse than I do, but I can’t help but think “I’m 26, perfectly healthy (minus the endo); why the fuck does this keep happening?”

Can anyone who has been in this situation tell me if having surgery reduced their fertility further? My doctor is currently delivering so I’m not able to get any solid answers just yet.

**Last update:** thanks everyone for your support and your good vibes.

The positive to come from this is now she’s going to start looking into why we can’t hold a pregnancy, so hopefully that will provide some answers.

I am 36f, 37 next month. My husband is 41. We've just started our first IVF cycle and I am on day two of stims (ETA: tonight is day 3), 150 Gonal F and 75 of Menopur. It was a long road to get here. I went off BCP when I turned 30 (2013) thinking things would happen on their own. Not the case. After trying half-assed for 3 years we got a little more serious and I started using OPKs and became obsessed about peeing on all the sticks. I did that for another year or two, while we struggled hard in our marriage and our communication. Initial bloodwork and HSG for me looked good, no issues. The next step was a SA for my husband. He refused.

We went back and forth like this until early 2018 when he finally did the SA. Super low, 3.3mil. We saw a urologist mid-2018 and he prescribed Clomid as he wouldn't even recommend IUI for us unless the SA got up to at least 10mil. My husband wouldn't take the Clomid. Meanwhile, EVERYONE around us was getting pregnant. All of the friends who got married . after us, whose weddings we attended, who were younger than us, who hadn't even tried that long. ALL OF THEM. I'm sure you can all relate.  Meanwhile, our marriage continued to suffer and we both stopped trying to make it work.

Fast forward to Dec 2018, I decided I was done. I moved out of our home, got my own place and we were separated briefly. It was a giant wake up call for my husband and even though I had zero expectations of working things out, after intensive couples counseling and my own therapy, we ended up reconciling and I moved back in last April.

Part of me still wonders if the Clomid would have worked and we could have been successful trying IUI, but here we are. My AMH is good (4.12) and our doctor feels IVF will be successful. I'm more scared than I expected now that we've started everything. These injections suck. I'm not a wuss usually, but damn, IVF may turn me into one. I am a bit nervous about OHSS as the doctor did say that was his one real concern for me. Yay.

31,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I've come to the conclusion that **Google is not your friend in your infertility journey.**  While Google is a great tool in general, I think its use should be minimized in a high-stakes, expensive, emotionally-charged topic like infertility/IVF.

I wanted to share a chronicle of how Google is slowly driving me insane, and why you should minimize your use of it.  (I could also do a better job of following my own advice.)

Our friends recommended us a particular fertility clinic and doctor (it's the doctor we ended up using).

So, I did what I normally do, and  I googled them.  Yikes, they only have a 3.8/5 on Google and a 3.5/5 on Yelp.  Oh, but they have a 8.9/10 on FertilityIQ, and a 5/5 on Facebook, so that's pretty good.  But this is all pretty contradictory,  so what do I do?

I google the doctor.  Oh, that's reassuring, she has a 5/5 on Google and a 9.2/10 on FertilityIQ, a 4.8 on Healthgrades, a 4.5 on WebMD, and a 5 on RateMDs.  Oh, but wait, she only has a 3.9 on Vitals.  Hoo, that's a little concerning.

Wait a minute, are these numbers good or bad by the standards of IVF specialists?  I better google some other doctors for comparison.  My wife's cousin is using a different doctor at a different clinic.  Let's look them up.

Ooh, their clinic has a 4.3/5 on Google, a 9/10 on FertilityIQ, and a 4/5 on Yelp.  Oh, but they only have a 4.7/5 on Facebook.  Still, should we look at their clinic instead?  Let me look up their doctor.

Oh, he has a 4.6/5 on Vitals and a 4.6/5 on WebMD, which is encouraging, but wait... he only has a 8.7/10 on FertilityIQ, and a 4.6/5 on Healthgrades.

Wait a minute, FertilityIQ also breaks clinics and doctors down by whether patients highly recommend them, are neutral, or don't recommend them.  84% of people like our doctor (only 4% don't), whereas 73% of people like the other doctor and 11% don't.  So that's good for our doctor.  And 81% of people like our clinic (8% don't), whereas 79% of people like the other clinic (6% don't).  So really, it kind of evens out the clinics.

What do I believe?  I guess the only option is to repeat this comparison for every other fertility doctor in the area.  But wait, numbers only tell so much -- let's read the actual *reviews* of all the doctors to see what people think of them as well.  Maybe the negative reviews of some doctors are written for stupid reasons.  Maybe there are trends we can pick up on.

Oh, that's handy, the CDC and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology publish statistics on the success rates of IVF clinics.  Hmm, they both say that the statistics shouldn't be used to compare clinics, because they're easy to manipulate (you can drive up your success rates by rejecting tough patients), certain numbers are skewed by certain procedures like genetic testing of embryos and banking cycles, and different clinics might have different patient profiles, and the sample sizes are fairly small on an individual clinic.

Oh, who cares, let's look anyway.

That's encouraging, our clinic has the best rates in the region for frozen embryo transfers in women between the ages of 35-37, which meets our current situation... but there are other clinics that are better at the 38-40 age group, which my wife will be hitting soon.  But our clinic did pretty well in the 41-42 age group, so maybe the 38-40 numbers were just a bad fluke?  Or maybe the 35-37 numbers are the fluke?

Wait, why does the other clinic have better success rates on younger patients than ours does?  Should that raise red flags?

I had better make a spreadsheet of all this data so that I can look at it better.

Our doctor is a big fan of Intralipids.  Let's google it -- oh, here's a small study that showed a nearly fivefold improvement in success rates when using the treatment.  And here's another small study showing the same thing.  Oh wait, here's another study showing no benefit at all.  And another one.  Here's an article saying that any doctor who uses this procedure is selling you snake oil.

This other clinic seems to be a proponent of lupron pretreatments for endometriosis, and look -- here's a meta-analysis from Cochrane showing that this therapy increases success rates fourfold in endometriosis patients, which we may or may not have!  Why isn't our clinic pushing that treatment?  Oh wait, here's another later meta-analysis **by the same organization** saying that they were wrong, and the treatment probably doesn't help much at all.

Is our doctor a fraud?  Are the other doctors frauds?

Or maybe most doctors are just pretty good?

Thanks to Google, despite all this information, I have *literally* no idea what to believe from all of this.  But I'm compelled to keep looking for more, just in case I find something that truly convinces me that we're at the best clinic/doctor.  But since there's nothing out there that will truly convince me of this, the only thing the internet does is drive me crazy with anxiety over whether we're making the best choices for ourselves.

Before the internet, I would have just taken our friend's advice, and when we found we liked the doctor, we probably would have just stuck with her and not questioned our decision at all.

Unfortunately, I can get pregnant really easily, but can't seem to keep any of them, and have had six miscarriages now in the last year. The last time we were just days shy of twelve weeks, and it's been really hard for my husband and I. We were just watching our favourite show The Office last night. It was the episode where Jim and Pam are in the doctor's office and the doctor tells them that she is pregnant. I know it's a tv show, but they did a damn good job at making their happiness and excitement seem so real and genuine. Just as the scene was happening my husband just started really breaking down. We're getting really scared that this may not happen for us.

We recently saw a fertility doctor recently and she advised us that because of my age, that we should do IVF with a combination of something else I cannot quite remember. It was something about freezing eggs and viable embryos after genetic testing and keeping them after. It's been really fast and really difficult so please excuse my lack of memory. Anyway, she told us it would be nearly $25,000CAD, and the success rate is 95%. Now since I can already get pregnant, and she knows that, I'm not really sure what she meant. I get pregnant nearly every time already, I just can't keep them. So is she saying 95% will result in a healthy baby? Is she taking us for a ride and just wanting our money? We read different stuff online, like IVF can fail or miscarry just as easy as regular pregnancy.

Has anyone else had any experience with this? I would really appreciate some feedback. We're desperate. $25,000CAD is a lot for us and we have no help. It will end up shaping our future in a big way, and a very negative way if we waste all this money and come up short of a healthy baby.

**Mention of pregnancy or positive results** post treatment is only permitted in the results thread. Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C""). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.

**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain.

People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic, and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies/cures as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).

Sex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. **Infertility isn't cute**, and neither are the terms we use. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.

**No solicitations** will be allowed for monetary or medication donations. To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed.

We suspect endometriosis -- my wife has painful intercourse, and a blocked fallopian tube despite never having had abdominal surgery or pelvic inflammatory disease.  We haven't gotten surgical confirmation, and our clinic doesn't offer ReceptivaDx.  (ReceptivaDx is the uterine biopsy that purportedly identifies a gene correlated with endometriosis.)

I believe that the ReceptivaDx people advocate 3 months of lupron depot shots if endometriosis is suspected, and there's a [pretty well-known Cochrane review](https://www.cochrane.org/CD004635/MENSTR_long-term-pituitary-down-regulation-before-in-vitro-fertilization-ivf-for-women-with-endometriosis) from 2006 showing a fourfold increase in success for endo patients after a lupron depot.  We were putting a lot of hope in talking to our doctor about this after a failed PGS FET (chemical pregnancy).

However, less than two months ago, Cochrane released [another review saying](https://www.cochrane.org/CD013240/MENSTR_long-term-pituitary-down-regulation-vitro-fertilisation-ivf-women-endometriosis) that lupron depot doesn't help at all in endo patients, and that this supersedes their old study.

2.5 years ago when my husband and I started TTC, I was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in situ , very early stage cervical cancer, and had to have a cold knife cone biopsy. The doctor was comfortable allowing us to try for pregnancy, but I will eventually need a hysterectomy.
We waited six months after surgery before trying again, though this included a time period of 113 days where I didn't get my period. Finally, it was induced with a combo of estrogen and progesterone. 

We tried for six months to get pregnant and then were referred to a RE. Testing showed everything looked normal for both of us, so they were optimistic to try with IUI, which was covered by insurance. No luck. Six unmedicated IUIs in, we decided to move on to IVF. 

We did our retrieval and a fresh cycle in July, with four day 5 blastocysts. After positive Beta testing, HCG was rising too slowly and I miscarried at 5w5d. 

Eager to begin another cycle, I had a saline sonogram, and discovered a polyp. A few weeks later, I had a hysteroscopy to successfully remove the polyp, which was benign. 

Our last cycle was an unmedicated FET, that I am currently miscarrying. The numbers for this one started low at 85 14dpt, so I was not optimistic. 

I'm sharing partially just to be heard - sometimes I feel like I'm playing infertility BINGO, as new issues keep popping up.

I know there a lot of rules, and I haven’t figured them all out yet. My issue is slightly time-sensitive though, so I wanted to give this a shot.)*

This my first IUI cycle, with Clomid. I have been struggling with having great communication with my RE, and feel like they are not really aware of my goals, history, etc. Just that they have a planned protocol and stick to it, without individualizing. I’m concerned we are trying to trigger/do the IUI too soon. Details:

I took Clomid on CD5-CD9.

My lead follicle yesterday (CD11) was only 16mm. (The next two largest were 10mm and 5mm.) My LH was 14.1 and Estradiol was 687. (Today LH was 14.8.)

They want me to trigger tonight for an IUI on Tuesday morning (CD14).

In the last couple of cycles, I have been getting LH surges (tested with OPK) on day 15 or 16. I do seem to have been ovulating on my own, based on BBT and progesterone increases.

So, it seems to me like they are trying to get me to ovulate 3-4 days earlier than I normally would, with smaller than typical follicles? (Most mentions I see are of deciding to trigger after seeing 18-20+mm...)

When I asked the nurse who called a lot of questions today she said if I “didn’t want to follow the doctor’s recommendation” I could skip the trigger tonight and return for another follicle check tomorrow morning. I was just getting all of the information so I didn’t feel prepared to make the decision in the moment.

They might already be closed for the day, but I also realized they didn’t tell me how much of the trigger shot to use, so I need to call them either way.

If I was just making the decision on my own, with the information I have right now, I think I would want to do monitoring tomorrow morning, probably trigger tomorrow night, do the IUI on Wednesday morning.

But, I’m not sure. Maybe my follicles are growing faster than normal and this timing is fine?

I'm using donor sperm, so this is extra expensive, and it would be great to have the best possible shot...

59,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all . . . hope this is okay as stand alone post. I've been lurking for a while and feel like now more than ever I need to introduce myself to the community.  A little backstory: 

My husband (35) and I (36) have been TTC since early 2015 without success (we've never even had the faintest of a line). In 2016 we went to see an RE and did all of the diagnostic tests (HSG, SAs, Day 3 etc.). Everything looked fine, so we were diagnosed with unexplained infertility. The plan was 3 medicated IUIs and then on to IVF. I got the meds, started the IUI cycle, and then freaked out and never went through with it. 

There were a lot of reasons. I had a bunch of (irrational) hangups about infertility treatment. I was worried that we were tempting ""fate"" by trying to get what we clearly weren't supposed to have, and we'd befall some tragedy should we pursue it. (This is crazy. I know.). And I already felt like I had obsessed over TTC for 18 months and I just didn't want to think about it anymore.  My gut was telling me it wasn't the time. I just needed a break. 

A break turned into 3 years. It was really, really good. I stopped thinking about my cycle, I didn't worry about when I was going to pee on a stick (didn't touch one for 3 years!). We went on a bunch of really nice trips-even to a Zika country!-and we just generally enjoyed life. It's not that I decided I didn't want children--I just sort of put it out of my head for awhile. I'm sure this wasn't healthy, but it felt great. 

In the meantime, everyone we know had children. And we started to look around and see what we were missing. It became harder to push out of our minds. My husband, who had kindly deferred to me on stopping the treatment, started asking when we were going to finally start it up again. Finally this summer we went back to the RE. We had to re-do all the diagnostics (still unexplained) and I needed a hysteroscopy, and (minor) polypectomy.

All that pushed our first IUI to 12/26. I'm now 9dpiui, and realizing why I was so scared to do this. I think about it (it being -- will this work?)--every single day. It takes so much energy. I google stupid stuff and look at posts upon endless posts about what day everyone got a positive test with what symptoms (you know what I'm talking about). It is such a black hole of pointlessness and wasted time. 

I know that we will probably have to move to IVF. (I don't think IUI is going to work when we know I ovulate and he has ok sperm and we've been having unprotected sex with no success for 5 years.). But I just don't know how to have the mental fortitude to go through what I think is going to be a really long journey without getting my hopes up every single month. And googling dumb shit every single day. I remember feeling like this when I was first TTC in 2015-16. It was terrible!! It was just so much easier when I stopped trying. When I had pretended to move on.

We live in Los Angeles so we have dozens of options and I'm stuck in a loop of comparing statistics, reviews, financing options, etc.

For people who had options, what factors did you consider? At any point did you just go with the doctor you connected with the most, or lab with the best statistics, or clinic with a guarantee program over pay as you go?

We're choosing between two different clinics, one has a guarantee program (up to 6 retrievals, 100% refund if no live birth) and pay as you go. Under the PAYG model two retrievals/two transfers would be the same as the guarantee (we've already agreed our personal limit is 3 retrievals), but we could embryo bank which isn't an option with the guarantee unless the first retrievals is gangbusters. All of my labs are completely normal and our only known problem is mild MFI, every doctor I've spoken to has given us great odds (which concerns me for other reasons b/c I don't want to be lulled in to a false sense of security and obviously many many things are unknown/could go wrong). Because of the doctors' confidence and our desire to embryo bank, we're leaning towards PAYG.

<p>For people who had options, what factors did you consider? At any point did you just go with the doctor you connected with the most, or lab with the best statistics, or clinic with a guarantee program over pay as you go?</p>

<p>We&#39;re choosing between two different clinics, one has a guarantee program (up to 6 retrievals, 100% refund if no live birth) and pay as you go. Under the PAYG model two retrievals/two transfers would be the same as the guarantee (we&#39;ve already agreed our personal limit is 3 retrievals), but we could embryo bank which isn&#39;t an option with the guarantee unless the first retrievals is gangbusters. All of my labs are completely normal and our only known problem is mild MFI, every doctor I&#39;ve spoken to has given us great odds (which concerns me for other reasons b/c I don&#39;t want to be lulled in to a false sense of security and obviously many many things are unknown/could go wrong). Because of the doctors&#39; confidence and our desire to embryo bank, we&#39;re leaning towards PAYG.</p>

I’m not sure if this is more appropriate to a daily thread and am happy to move to one if so.  

Important background: I’m currently benched due to a never ending miscarriage after a partial molar pregnancy.  I had a D&C in October and am still waiting on my HCG to drop.  I’m around 550 now and am anticipating another 2 months or so to get to negative.  I’m tested weekly to monitor because there’s a slight risk of cancer with PMPs.  Once negative, I’ll move on to monthly testing and cannot conceive for some determined amount of time (I’ve seen it range from 1 month to 6 months and haven’t asked my doc on an estimate yet as I’m still not at 0).

I am ridiculously upset about the time I’m losing while waiting for the HCG to drop.  Back in October, I thought I’d take a month off or so and then return to IUI treatment.  Now I’m concerned I may be benched until Fall/Winter 2020 and am wondering if it’s worth proceeding to IVF.

I’m 32 (turning 33 in the fall).  I have PCOS and do not ovulate on my own.  Per my RE, all my numbers are normal (AMH last December was 3.2 if helpful) but TSH (3.4) was a bit high so I’m on thyroid meds.  Husband had an SA with good results.  No issues on his end. 

Began treatment in March 2019 with TI using Letrozole.  After 2 months, trigger shot was added.  We did 4 months of TI (3 letrozole, 1 clomid) then switched to IUI with Clomid.  We had success with the only IUI we did but miscarried due to genetic abnormality (triploidy 69).  

When I met with RE for D&C follow up, she said we can continue with IUI or move into IVF with PGS testing.  At the time, we were definitely planning on continuing with the IUI.  Given the PMP wait, now we’re torn.  I’m worried about losing more time.  We’d love to have 2 children so I would like to maximize my chance at earlier success.  

Insurance wise, we have some coverage now (meds and u/s covered, we pay for everything else).  That leaves us with IUI costs of about $350.  IVF would be significantly more.  We could afford it now but it would eat a bit into our savings.  Our income will significantly increase in about 1.5 years but we’ll be losing our coverage and assume that we’d have no infertility coverage afterwards. (Though we obviously won’t know that for sure until we know the next job).

I’m easing my way back in here after a big break after my chemical pregnancy at the end of August. It was my only embryo from that first round of IVF. Since then I’ve switched clinics, had another ER, made many more eggs… but still ended up with just one euploid embryo. Because I had just the one, my RE advised me to do an ERA, which I did (owwww!). Now in FET prep mode I’m on a protocol with a full extra 24 hours of progesterone. 

The ERA results were so helpful, but they had a frustrating psychological effect: to blame what went wrong last time as the thing I’ve “fixed” and feeling that scary scary hope rising again. I’m struggling (as I have done throughout this process) between protecting myself from hope, and letting myself just have some fucking hope for a fucking change. 

My FET is next Wednesday, Jan 8. 

I wanted to ask you all what you think about my “shower thought” of the day. It’s about the new thinking around “aneuploid” embryos self-correcting in utero. In my recent ER I got 3 blasts (AA, AB, AB), of which one was normal. I wonder if I’m ever in this situation again if I would consider keeping the aneuploids and if my normal doesn’t take (or if I don't get one), just do a transfer cycle where I pop both of them in and see what happens? I’m 39 and there’s no guarantee I’ll get anything at all to transfer next cycle, so even the prospect of MC or TFMR with a tiny chance of success is maybe better than being out of eggs? Or is this totally nuts? (I know a lot of you have significant experience with MC and TFMR and that it's devastating, so I sincerely hope this doesn't come across as making light. It is so not meant that way.)

TIA and I’m glad to be back in this familiar and safe space.

We were just about to see an IVF specialist when I got my first ever positive (conceived naturally) it was a Christmas miracle. 
I started bleeding lightly  and cramping for a couple weeks. Everyone said it was normal for first trimester and I'd be fine and it was IBS causing the gastrointestinal cramps. 
12/30/19 I had massive pain and light bright red bleeding. I thought it was IBS symptoms again so I rolled around in pain for hours and ignored it. I woke up and realized  something was really wrong when I couldn't stand without  nearly passing out. 
At the hospital  I went through  the worst pain I've ever been through. At 7 weeks, my first ultrasound showed nothing not even a sack. It got more serious so they pushed me to take Morphine so I could withstand the pain of a vaginal ultrasound. 
12/31/19 they came in with my results  asking me the last time I ate... at that moment I panicked...
I was carrying an ectopic  pregnancy. My Fallopian Tube ruptured and I had internal bleeding in my abdominal cavity.

The doctors told me they removed my baby, and my fallopian tube from my body. 
Before the surgery I asked if he could save my baby's body no matter how small and what it looked like. He  told me it would be nothing but a clump of cells unrecognizable. He threw my 7 week baby away... like something disposable.... 
Now, I'm a 22 year old who was told I wouldn't be able to naturally conceive, but did, lost my baby and my fallopian tube and nearly my life. The doctors said If i try again it will likely be another Ectopic.

Before the surgery I asked if he could save my baby&#39;s body no matter how small and what it looked like. He  told me it would be nothing but a clump of cells unrecognizable. He threw my 7 week baby away... like something disposable.... 
Now, I&#39;m a 22 year old who was told I wouldn&#39;t be able to naturally conceive, but did, lost my baby and my fallopian tube and nearly my life. The doctors said If i try again it will likely be another Ectopic.
How do you go forward... I know how but..... how? You know? I feel...just...gone.
Sorry If not allowed... i dont know where else to go. I feel like I just need to talk. A not to people around me who just look at me with sorry eyes.</p>

93,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My doctor is prescribing the lupron trigger. Based upon my existing folliculle count and estrogen levels, I'm don't think that I am at risk for hyperstimulation.

I'm so confused about Lupron. It seems that it puts your body in a temporary state  of menopause and indirectly induces ovulation.

Many women who have taken for endometriosis have had long term terrible side-effects from it.

This is what's written on their website. Apparently its use for infertility is off label and not approved by the FDA.

Do not take LUPRON DEPOT if you are, may be, or are planning to  become pregnant, are breast‑feeding, have undiagnosed uterine bleeding,  or if you have experienced any type of allergic reaction to  LUPRON DEPOT, or similar drugs.

If your doctor prescribes you norethindrone acetate in  combination with LUPRON DEPOT 11.25 mg, please refer to the  norethindrone acetate prescribing information for more information about  its safe and effective use.

You should not take norethindrone acetate and LUPRON DEPOT  3.75 mg if you currently have or have previously had any clotting  disorder, heart disease, stroke, impaired liver function or liver  disease, or breast cancer.

Tell your healthcare provider before beginning treatment with  norethindrone acetate and LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg if you currently have or  have previously had high cholesterol, migraines, epilepsy, or  depression, or if you smoke.

During treatment with norethindrone acetate and LUPRON DEPOT  3.75 mg, immediately tell your doctor if you have a sudden loss of  vision, double vision, or if migraine headaches occur. You should notify  your doctor if you experience fluid retention, seizure, asthma or  worsening of asthmatic symptoms, or heart or kidney problems.

Thinning of the bones may occur during therapy with LUPRON DEPOT  alone, which may not be completely reversible in some patients. Since  some conditions may increase the possibility of bone thinning, you  should tell your doctor if you smoke, use alcohol in excess, have a  family history of osteoporosis (thinning of the bones with fractures),  or are taking other medications that can cause thinning of the bones.  You should be aware that if you have these conditions, treatment with  LUPRON DEPOT alone is not advisable and combination with norethindrone  acetate should be considered. Add‑back therapy can help reduce the bone  loss that occurs with the use of LUPRON DEPOT alone. If a second course  of treatment with LUPRON DEPOT is being considered, bone mineral testing  is recommended and retreatment should include combination with  norethindrone acetate.

LUPRON DEPOT may cause harm to your unborn child. LUPRON DEPOT is  not a method of birth control. Even though you may not have periods,  unprotected intercourse could result in pregnancy. You should use  non-hormonal birth control, such as condoms, a diaphragm with  contraceptive jelly, or a copper IUD, to prevent pregnancy. If you think  you have become pregnant while on LUPRON DEPOT, talk to your doctor  immediately.

Asthma was reported in women with a history of asthma, sinusitis,  and environmental or drug allergies. Serious allergic reactions have  also occurred.

After beginning LUPRON DEPOT, your estrogen levels will increase  during the first days of therapy. During this time, you may notice an  increase in your current symptoms. You should notify your doctor if you  develop any new or worsened symptoms after beginning LUPRON DEPOT  treatment.

Seizures have been observed in patients taking LUPRON DEPOT,  including patients who have a history of seizures or conditions related  to seizures or in patients who are taking medications that are connected  to seizures. Seizures have also been reported in patients without any  of these conditions.

Depression may worsen while taking norethindrone acetate.  Patients who have a history of depression should be carefully observed  during treatment. Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing any new or  worsening signs of depression.

The most common side effects of LUPRON DEPOT included hot  flashes/sweats, headache/migraine, decreased libido (interest in sex),  depression/emotional lability (changes in mood), dizziness,  nausea/vomiting, pain, vaginitis, and weight gain. These are not all of  the possible side effects of LUPRON DEPOT. Talk to your doctor for  medical advice about side effects.

LUPRON DEPOT for treatment of endometriosis has been limited to  women 18 years of age and older. LUPRON DEPOT is not indicated in  postmenopausal women.

LUPRON DEPOT must be administered in your doctor’s office.

Based upon my existing folliculle count and estrogen levels, I&#39;m don&#39;t think that I am at risk for hyperstimulation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so confused about Lupron. It seems that it puts your body in a temporary state  of menopause and indirectly induces ovulation.</p>

<p>Many women who have taken for endometriosis have had long term terrible side-effects from it.</p>

<p>This is what&#39;s written on their website. Apparently its use for infertility is off label and not approved by the FDA.</p>

<p>Do not take LUPRON DEPOT if you are, may be, or are planning to  become pregnant, are breast‑feeding, have undiagnosed uterine bleeding,  or if you have experienced any type of allergic reaction to  LUPRON DEPOT, or similar drugs.</p>

<p>If your doctor prescribes you norethindrone acetate in  combination with LUPRON DEPOT 11.25 mg, please refer to the  norethindrone acetate prescribing information for more information about  its safe and effective use.</p>

<p>You should not take norethindrone acetate and LUPRON DEPOT  3.75 mg if you currently have or have previously had any clotting  disorder, heart disease, stroke, impaired liver function or liver  disease, or breast cancer.</p>

<p>Tell your healthcare provider before beginning treatment with  norethindrone acetate and LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg if you currently have or  have previously had high cholesterol, migraines, epilepsy, or  depression, or if you smoke.</p>

<p>During treatment with norethindrone acetate and LUPRON DEPOT  3.75 mg, immediately tell your doctor if you have a sudden loss of  vision, double vision, or if migraine headaches occur. You should notify  your doctor if you experience fluid retention, seizure, asthma or  worsening of asthmatic symptoms, or heart or kidney problems.</p>

<p>Thinning of the bones may occur during therapy with LUPRON DEPOT  alone, which may not be completely reversible in some patients. Since  some conditions may increase the possibility of bone thinning, you  should tell your doctor if you smoke, use alcohol in excess, have a  family history of osteoporosis (thinning of the bones with fractures),  or are taking other medications that can cause thinning of the bones.  You should be aware that if you have these conditions, treatment with  LUPRON DEPOT alone is not advisable and combination with norethindrone  acetate should be considered. Add‑back therapy can help reduce the bone  loss that occurs with the use of LUPRON DEPOT alone. If a second course  of treatment with LUPRON DEPOT is being considered, bone mineral testing  is recommended and retreatment should include combination with  norethindrone acetate.</p>

<p>LUPRON DEPOT may cause harm to your unborn child. LUPRON DEPOT is  not a method of birth control. Even though you may not have periods,  unprotected intercourse could result in pregnancy. You should use  non-hormonal birth control, such as condoms, a diaphragm with  contraceptive jelly, or a copper IUD, to prevent pregnancy. If you think  you have become pregnant while on LUPRON DEPOT, talk to your doctor  immediately.</p>

<p>Asthma was reported in women with a history of asthma, sinusitis,  and environmental or drug allergies. Serious allergic reactions have  also occurred.</p>

<p>After beginning LUPRON DEPOT, your estrogen levels will increase  during the first days of therapy. During this time, you may notice an  increase in your current symptoms. You should notify your doctor if you  develop any new or worsened symptoms after beginning LUPRON DEPOT  treatment.</p>

<p>Seizures have been observed in patients taking LUPRON DEPOT,  including patients who have a history of seizures or conditions related  to seizures or in patients who are taking medications that are connected  to seizures. Seizures have also been reported in patients without any  of these conditions.</p>

<p>Depression may worsen while taking norethindrone acetate.  Patients who have a history of depression should be carefully observed  during treatment. Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing any new or  worsening signs of depression.</p>

What made it harder this year was being with my parents and their first grandchild. A sweet and good natured baby, 4 months old.

She was an unexpected addition to the family, my youngest brother got his very new girlfriend pregnant and all the family were upset, it melted away when the baby arrived of course which I understand.

I’m in a situation where I love the baby but it’s breaking my heart to see my family home filled with baby gear and everyone sitting around enjoying her. I wish it was me and my husband so much. 

They held the baptism in our church over Christmas and it was so so painful wondering if I will ever be back their with our child. 

Anyways, the point of my post is that my brother knows I’m in pain, my sister even talked to him about how hard this all is for us but he is just being awkward and quiet around me and it’s so sad. Like our current lives are so different there are no words to share. 

I wish he could just say I hope you’re okay, I can’t imagine how hard this is or thank you for being here, I know it’s mixed emotions.

It took me about 2 years to open up and talk to friends and family about infertility, it was a big step but I didn’t get the support I hoped for. It’s just sad and awkward and there’s a level of guilt or something with those friends who have beautiful children.

It’s great to talk to people going through/ or been through infertility but I wish I could be open and vulnerable with people closest to me.

<p>When we started this process we learned we were facing MFI (morphology, fragmentation, low but not nonexistent, count) and seemingly everything was “normal” on my side. Countless rounds of ICSI, and now...years later, also DOR. While I recognize that this is rarely, if ever,  a “one or the other “ issue, I can’t help but want to ask why we wouldn’t even suggest sperm donation and ultimately always need to head on over to donor eggs. </p>

<p>Fundamentally, I don’t have any issue with this (emotionally, I have some work to do as evidenced by this post) but my feeling of ‘the patriarchy is strong’ is resonating loudly right now - we are fully still with the sports analogies and the fact that we are ‘not batting 100%’ references with our doc...my hubs says he would possibly consider what that could mean if the science was there...is it? Anywhere? </p>

<p>Is there anything to suggest that our recent PGS non-normals are anything other than my rotten eggs? If you have any thoughts you’re willing to share and would like more info than what I’ve provided, I’m happy to share!</p>

My co workers are aware of my fertility struggles due to needing time off for appointments and such, but I’ve never even broached the subject of surrogacy and two separate women who looooove (insert eye roll) being pregnant have said they think it would be fun to be a surrogate and that they’d do it for someone like me.

My husband and I started our first IVF cycle in September after trying to conceive for roughly 2 years. Transfer was 11/21 and after lots of ups and downs, blood tests, ultrasounds, etc I miscarried yesterday.  All 3 ultrasounds I had they could only see the sac and it wasn't growing as it should so I knew it was coming but I was still holding onto some hope that our situation would be different. At Monday's ultrasound we got the official diagnosis of blighted ovum and they told me to stop taking medication.  I ugly cried in the car afterwards and my poor husband held my hand and rubbed my back trying to soothe me. 

I told my boss I wouldn't be coming in and instead decided to put myself to work at the house we just bought. Cramps got progressively worse throughout the day and around 2:30 I decided to head home while my husband waited for the pool maintenance guy to show up. Around 3:30 I called my husband to ask him to come home quick because the pain was absolutely unbearable and I might need to go to the hospital.

I couldn't handle any pressure on my body so I asked my husband to undress me and lay a towel underneath me.There was A LOT of blood. I laid in bed while squeezing his hand and praying for the pain to go away. I had some leftover pain medication from the egg retrieval procedure so I took those and waited for them to kick in for what seemed like hours but probably was only 20 minutes. I was pretty delirious and all I remember is repeating ""it hurts"".  After a while I felt the need to push so I did and I passed the sac.  I remember thinking it was a really strange sensation having something come out where things only normally go in.  Husband squeezed my hand and told me I was doing great while he scooped up what came out and took it to the bathroom to dispose of it. He came back and a few minutes later I passed the placenta - both the sac and placenta weren't any bigger than the palm of my hand but they were much bigger than I was expecting. I was technically 8 weeks along but they said the sac was measuring at 5 weeks so I thought it would be pretty tiny and was a bit surprised at how big it was. I don't know how to explain what I felt when I saw them come out - grief, panic, relief, a mix of a lot of things I'm sure.  I had another ugly cry while my husband held me.  The pain subsided pretty quickly after that - not sure if it was due to passing all the tissue or the pain medication finally working.  I should note here that I was bleeding before the ultrasound and they didn't give me any information about what to expect, I also explained I was having some cramps but all they told me was they were sorry and to stop my medication. After resting for a while I started feeling pretty bothered that the clinic didn't prepare me in anyway for what would happen.

Part of me feels it was a beautiful experience with my husband, I got to see a side of him I don't usually. The pain was 10 times what I expected and I wasn't prepared for seeing the sac and the placenta. I couldn't imagine how much harder it would have been if there was actually a baby in there.  Overall it's an experience I hope I never have to repeat and I have a newfound respect for the women out there who have been through the same or worse.

All 3 ultrasounds I had they could only see the sac and it wasn&#39;t growing as it should so I knew it was coming but I was still holding onto some hope that our situation would be different. At Monday&#39;s ultrasound we got the official diagnosis of blighted ovum and they told me to stop taking medication.  I ugly cried in the car afterwards and my poor husband held my hand and rubbed my back trying to soothe me. </p>

<p>I told my boss I wouldn&#39;t be coming in and instead decided to put myself to work at the house we just bought. Cramps got progressively worse throughout the day and around 2:30 I decided to head home while my husband waited for the pool maintenance guy to show up. Around 3:30 I called my husband to ask him to come home quick because the pain was absolutely unbearable and I might need to go to the hospital.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t handle any pressure on my body so I asked my husband to undress me and lay a towel underneath me.There was A LOT of blood. I laid in bed while squeezing his hand and praying for the pain to go away. I had some leftover pain medication from the egg retrieval procedure so I took those and waited for them to kick in for what seemed like hours but probably was only 20 minutes. I was pretty delirious and all I remember is repeating &quot;it hurts&quot;.  After a while I felt the need to push so I did and I passed the sac.  I remember thinking it was a really strange sensation having something come out where things only normally go in.  Husband squeezed my hand and told me I was doing great while he scooped up what came out and took it to the bathroom to dispose of it. He came back and a few minutes later I passed the placenta - both the sac and placenta weren&#39;t any bigger than the palm of my hand but they were much bigger than I was expecting. I was technically 8 weeks along but they said the sac was measuring at 5 weeks so I thought it would be pretty tiny and was a bit surprised at how big it was. I don&#39;t know how to explain what I felt when I saw them come out - grief, panic, relief, a mix of a lot of things I&#39;m sure.  I had another ugly cry while my husband held me.  The pain subsided pretty quickly after that - not sure if it was due to passing all the tissue or the pain medication finally working.  I should note here that I was bleeding before the ultrasound and they didn&#39;t give me any information about what to expect, I also explained I was having some cramps but all they told me was they were sorry and to stop my medication. After resting for a while I started feeling pretty bothered that the clinic didn&#39;t prepare me in anyway for what would happen.</p>

<p>Part of me feels it was a beautiful experience with my husband, I got to see a side of him I don&#39;t usually. The pain was 10 times what I expected and I wasn&#39;t prepared for seeing the sac and the placenta. I couldn&#39;t imagine how much harder it would have been if there was actually a baby in there.  Overall it&#39;s an experience I hope I never have to repeat and I have a newfound respect for the women out there who have been through the same or worse.  We are sad that the hopes and dreams we were building over the last 6 weeks are suddenly on pause but we&#39;re still hopeful for the future.</p>

I don’t know what else to do. I don’t know how to make this go away and I don’t know how to stop hating myself and my body because it can’t do what it’s supposed to do and nobody knows why. It’s been a rough month.</p>

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

I’ve gone to NYC IVF in the past (for my egg freezing) and restarted conversations recently. But I am considering trying a different clinic. Should I be worried that NYC IVF isn’t listed on the SART website?  I’ve had a positive experience with them, and there are good reviews on Fertility IQ, but feel more reassured reading about CCRM.

155,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"TL; DR at bottom

Background: 
In October 2018, I was referred to a reproductive endocrinologist after my regular OB had put me on letrozole with 6 months of timed intercourse. After running initial tests, he diagnosed us with unexplained infertility and recommended a course of action. From November 2018 to January 2019, our RE had us do IUI with letrozole, 

Our RE was the head of the clinic and one of the first people to really help advance ART in the early 80s so I thought I had picked the right Dr for our case. However, we had many missteps along the way with still no concrete diagnosis, and found out he was retiring in August 2019. The missteps weren’t really anything anyone could have predicted, so I don’t chalk most of that up to my RE. In our first IVF cycle, they started me at 125 follistim and ended up higher. I retrieved 7 days after beginning stims. On retrieval day, I had an artery hanging out in front of one of my ovaries, so he was only able to retrieve from my left ovary. He retrieved 9 from that ovary, 8 were mature but none made it to blast. In our second round, we did 100 follistim, 75 menopur. We retrieved 19, with 16 mature, 3 making it to day 5, but only 2 were size “3” and one was size “2” so it was not frozen.

During my second retrieval, a different doctor in the practice had stepped in to do the retrieval because my doctor was out of the office that day. During that retrieval the new Dr saw a submucosal fibroid on the ultrasound (that had been there during saline u/s and HSG in the past but my initial RE said not to worry about). The new Dr was pretty worried about being able to rule out other causes of miscarriage if that happened so she pushed to remove it. The fibroid was removed in August 2019 by the new Dr as my old Dr was retiring. After the fibroid removal we did our first FET in October 2019. This resulted in a blighted ovum that passed in mid-November. Following the passage of tissue we had it genetically tested, it came back normal, and scheduled a WTF and baseline appointment with the new Dr.

Fast forward to today, we had our meeting with our new Dr. we really liked her and had a great meeting. She finally diagnosed me with PCOS, which I was fairly certain I had anyways because of irregular periods, pearl like structure to ovaries and some mild hair growth on face. I’ve also gained 30 lbs in the last 3 years even though I have continued to be physically active and haven’t changed my diet, except for the better. She is putting me on Metformin immediately and has ordered a full panel of tests for PCOS and recurrent pregnancy loss and really gave me a good idea of the plan going forward.

TL;DR: we’ve been unexplained for 3 years, just diagnosed with PCOS yesterday.

Has management of PCOS significantly increased blast rate for anyone who had been unexplained in prior treatment cycles? If so, what was the treatment protocol your dr put you on? Are there any other tests I should push for?",t2_2ovr2vxv,False,,0,False,"I finally have a diagnosis, but does it change anything?",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_egqtc0,False,dark,1.0,,public,10,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Treatment Advice,False,10,,False,self,1577553660.0,,[],{},,True,,1577568969.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>TL; DR at bottom</p>

Both of them gave each set of parents their first grandchild. We had been trying to almost 2 years and always thought we’d have the first grandchild. 

My mom is extremely disinterested in my infertility struggle. I will tell her that I have an IUI scheduled and she won’t ask me anything about it, how I’m feeling, or if it worked. I know most people would appreciate the space on whether the cycle was successful or not, but this is not like my mom. She is normally all up in my business. Since her and my mother in law got their grandchild, they have both lost interest in me and my husband. 

My sister in law and I always got along just fine but we have never really built a friendship. I have to say that when I found out she was pregnant so soon (they started trying on their wedding night and found out exactly 5 weeks later) I started to really dislike her. I am well aware of how stupid this sounds but I really was just bitter and jealous. I also have kept her baby at arms length. I am just so hurt by something she had no control over, but this is a convo for my therapist. 

What I wanted advice on today is how to talk to my mom. She is oddly obsessed with my sister in law’s baby. She told me last night that she wishes my SIL were coming to my house for Christmas so that my sister’s baby and SIL’s baby can meet (10 mos and 6mos old). I told her that’s weird, those babies aren’t even related. Then today my SIL posted a pic of her baby in front of the tree and my mom commented “I wish I can meet him this year!” This really fucking pisses me off. I need to tell my mom to cool it and be more sensitive to my feelings. How do I tell her this without sounding crazy or making it out like I’m trying to control what she says? I want to let her know it hurts me that she’s so obsessed with this baby she’s never met who belongs to my SIL I don’t like (albeit for no real reason at all) and she’s only met my SIL maybe 3x?

I have the following available for donation to anyone who needs it.

I can mail the following if you just PayPal me the shipping cost: 

38 doses of endometrin 100mg with applicators - exp 9/2021

I’ll take the endometrin out of their boxes and ship in an envelope to cut down cost. I would prefer to do USPS priority mail so the cost would be about $7-8.

I also have the following available for local pick-up:
Gonal F 900 IU x 1
Gonal F 450 IU x 1
Both expire Jan 2020, so would need to be picked up soon.

Also important information for the question I'm asking, as it is important to the decision I need to make: my MIL does not like me and I wasn't invited to Christmas this year, but my husband was. My husband didn't feel like that was a big deal, which made me feel like he was basically okay with me only being a part of half of his life. We got into a big issue about it and eventually he decided not to attend her Christmas. This whole situation made me realize she is toxic and I do not want her a part of our children's lives. We were going to put TTC on hold, so that he could prove to me that he is okay with that decision, but then he talked with his mom on speakerphone yesterday and the things he said to her made me trust him on that topic. He also told me that regardless of how long we wait to resume TTC, I will still always be worried he will change his mind, which is correct. 

So, the question I'm asking, should we continue doing IUI the next 2 cycles (our clinic recommends 3 consecutive IUIs and then meeting to discuss if anything needs to change) or should we put it on hold while we pursue additional testing for MFI and see if there is a cure/solution?

Reasons we want to wait:
-mom drama
-MFI testing
-we are both young and have time

Reasons we want to continue with IUI:
-there will always be mom drama
-the chances of there being a solution to MFI is probably not very good
-our VCM last cycle was good (just under 9 million)
-my AMH was on the low end of normal (1.2) so I dont want to wait and then have more issues later on

You need to quit drinking. It will help you conceive.

Wait, why aren't you drinking? Are you pregnant? 

Might as well just go get drunk and have sex, maybe it will work! 

But remember, you shouldn't drink, it's bad for baby!


Do you know what ovulation is?

Are you taking your temperature at the same time every morning?

Make sure you don't wake up in the night or your temperature won't be right! 

After your temperature, feel your cervix! It will tell you when you're fertile.

And then record it all on this free app!

You must not be doing it right, are you using the app? 

You don't like feeling your cervix every morning? 

Don't you want to be a mom?


Have sex on day 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18

Or just pee on this stick every day it will tell you when you're ovulating!

The results are confusing? You must be doing it wrong!

You're ovulating? Where's your husband's dick right now?

He needs to stop everything, get a boner and fuck you immediately! 

Remember, don't use lube, don't use spit

You're not in the mood? Do you even want to have a baby? 

Why isn't your husband enjoying this? Just make it fun!


If having sex is so hard, just adopt and you'll get pregnant!

Never mind that adoptions don't always work out

Never mind they cost tens of thousands of dollars

Never mind that its five years of agony waiting for a baby

If you really want to be a mom you'd do it

If you just tried, it would work out. 


Just stop trying, and it will happen!


Meditate!

Counseling!

Yoga!

Exercise!

Quit coffee!

Quit drinking!

Why are you so stressed?

Just go on vacation, you'll get pregnant!


You had a miscarriage? 

Only one? My sister had five. 

It was just an embryo. 

Why are you losing hope?

Don't you want to be a mom? 


Might as well enjoy your freedom now before you have kids!

Wait, why did your husband go on a fishing trip? You need his dick right now!

Why did you quit your job? You need the maternity leave benefit!

Why are you getting such a small car if you're going to have a kid?

Why are you partying so much? 

If you want a baby, you have to try!


You really should have started sooner. I told you it would take a while.

Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant? I deserved to know. 

Why didn't you tell me about your miscarriage? 

You sure look old and fat after your miscarriage.

*Mention of pregnancy is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as ""we had success after x,y,z protocol""). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed.  Mentions of pregnancy loss and/or negative results are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area.*

*Mention of children is a touchy subject in this forum.  Previous success may be discussed in neutral language, sensitive language, when relevant to the context of an intro or answering a question about a particular protocol that lead to success.  Statements of medical facts are very helpful (ex. ""We had success after using xyz protocol"" vs ""my first IUI resulted in my 2yo daughter""), but unprompted discussion of children may be removed.

If there is a post asking about treatment options and someone responds with ""I had success after adding HGH priming to my last retrieval cycle. My previous 2 cycles did not result in any PGS normal blasts,"" that is allowed. Intro posts that mention previous success or secondary infertility in neutral language, are also allowed.

So my PCP (also does my yearly pelvic so I didn't have a separate gyno) said my last stop before a clinic was to get a HSG but she couldn't prescribe it so referred me to an in network gyno just to get the HSG prescribed. I went, got the prescription and made an appointment with the radiology department she told me to- basically the major hospital next door.

24 hours before my scheduled appointment the radiology department called and told me my test wasn't covered by insurance and would cost $1100. I tried fighting it with them and again with the billing department the next morning since it should be diagnostic but was basically told because the gyno wrote ""infertility consult"" on my chart my insurance wouldn't cover it and I could either pay now or postpone and keep fighting the coding. I considered it a stupid tax for not checking the coding/language ahead of time and paid, asked for a super bill, was told it wouldn't be ready for a few days and then had the test done (everything was normal/clear).

But today I just got a second bill from the hospital for another $1500 for the same procedure (which notes it is in addition to my $1100 payment)! Making a whopping $2600 for a HSG. My research says that $1100 is the high end of normal for a HSG in my area. $2600 feels insane and like I'm being taken advantage of. 

Does anyone have advice or suggestions on how to fight this bill? I'm going down to billing in person tomorrow.

232,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,

I have hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) which basically means that I'm not producing enough GnRH on my own, which is turn means low LH/FSH and no ovulation without drugs. Has anyone heard of a drug treatment called GnRH Pulsatile? According to a doctor who works at my fertility clinic, there's a newish drug going through the FDA that's a pump that gives you a regular dose of GnRH and can get women with HA to ovulate without much more intervention. I'm having trouble finding info online, and apparently it's available in Europe and maybe Canada, but not the US yet. I'm trying to find out if there's any way to access this treatment.

I've been doing TIC protocol at my clinic, first with Clomid (which I don't respond to) and Menopur, which I DO respond to, but only at higher doses and then I end up with 4-6 mature follicles and we have to cancel the cycle due to risk for multiples. It actually did work the first time we did it, and I ended up pregnant only to loose the pregnancy at 13 weeks. So with all the subsequent cycles I've been requiring higher doses of Menopur to even get an initial response.

It seems like a drug that treats the root cause (absence of GnRH) would be a much more targeted and effective treatment, but I'm having trouble figuring out where it's even available. Has anyone in Europe heard of it or tried it? How did it work for you? I'd be willing to travel to get treated. At this point, without the GnRH drug I'll need to move to IVF, which I'm open to but see as a last resort due to the great expense and invasiveness of the procedures.

Any relevant stories or info would be great, thank you!",t2_33j1wgrt,False,,0,False,Information about treating HA and GnRH Pulsatile,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_ee0wkj,False,dark,0.87,,public,6,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1577020374.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone,</p>

&#x200B;

We had our first appointment today and in light of this chaos, I thought I'd update on how it went and what's happened in the interim.

To start, our hospital didn't just transition the IVF patients... they closed down the entire clinic. I found out when I called on CD1 to set up our 3rd IUI cycle. There was no email, no notice, no warning, nothing. They just... closed. When I called, they told us we needed to call Shady Grove and get set up with them and that they'd send a records release for me to sign. When I asked if this means we're skipping a cycle, the receptionist goes ""well, I mean, I guess you'll have to."" WTF? So, needless to say, I freaked out. I called SGF immediately, several times, but no one answered. I used their online chatbot to set up an appointment, but it froze on me halfway through. As a last ditch effort, I called SGF one more time and got through. They had already set up a phone tree for patients of my old clinic. They were able to set me up for a consultation on 12/30 (which is fast, less than two weeks). Later that day they called back- someone canceled their 10:30am on 12/20, could I come then? HECK YES!

So, fast forward to today... maybe its just new relationship butterflies, but I am in love. Our consult lasted an hour- the previous consult lasted about ten minutes. He walked through the prior diagnosis and what we've done until this point (3 rounds of unmonitored 50mg clomid, two rounds of monitored 100mg clomid + Ovidrel). He read ALL of my charts. He agrees with the PCOS diagnosis, but also has some concern that my AMH is low, especially given the PCOS diagnosis and he's worried that the appy I had done may have jostled some things around. He walked through OPTIONS with us- 1) do nothing 2) another round of medicated IUI 3) IUI w/ Gonadotropin 4) straight to IVF. We let him know that insurance was paying for the IUIs and he said ""lets just keep going with those for the time being."" He explained in detail the difference between IUI + meds and IUI + gonadotropin, including the indications and why adding FSH/LH might not make sense if the underlying issue is anovulation. He wants to run a cycle on meds with bloodwork before. Oh! Bloodwork- something my other clinic never did. We're getting genetic testing- something the other clinic never offered. We're getting infectious disease testing- something the other clinic never asked for. I'm getting suppositories for my lady bits to help with the lining- something my other clinic never presented as an option... and the Coup de Gras? We're switching the protocol. Our new Dr. isn't even sure why the old clinic had me on Clomid, since it obviously didn't work the first three times. We've switched to Letrozole + IM HCG. 

Now, here's the kicker. Dr asks ""where are you in your cycle?"" I respond ""Its CD5. I was going to ask you, given the PCOS and the fact that sometimes my periods take 45 days to show up naturally, would you be willing to write me a script for letrozole or clomid just to keep me on track so we can pick it up again in a month?"" He pauses, thinks and says ""listen, I can't just write you a prescription and then not monitor you, but let me see what I can do."" He gets up, leaves and comes back- ""If you have time today, we can do an ultrasound, get you started on meds tonight, and we'll just do a cycle in a few days. You're going to need to get Infectious disease testing done ASAP, but you can do that here. I'm also going to ask you to decline the genetic testing for now- we can do it on the next cycle, but if you don't decline, I can't treat you until the paperwork comes back, and we'll miss the window."" Holy Effing Crap. This guy is just going to go balls to the wall and start a cycle just so I don't have to skip a month?! Sold!

Overall, it was a much MUCH better experience than at my prior clinic and I somehow feel like less of a number, even though SGF is much bigger. The staff there admitted to us that my old clinic did NOT handle the transition well at all, and that they're going out of their way to smooth it over. The financial consultants, nurses, ultrasound tech, and physician all explained far more to us than we've ever been taught and asked us if we had questions at every step.

Can't find any experiences similar to mine and am struggling to cope as I wait for an appointment with a specialist.

(I know many in this sub have been trying longer and have suffered through more than me, so I hope I don't offend anyone by posting here, but I didn't feel like I fit in over at r/TryingForABaby since I am not even cycling).

Anyway, I'm 32. Was so excited to finally go off the pill early this year to start trying with my husband, after 13 years on the pill. Had a withdrawal bleed, then no period for 4 months. Went to my gyno, who did a progesterone challenge, after which I had withdrawal bleed no. 2. 

I was concerned about hypothalamic amenorrhea as I was a regular runner, and was at the time on the lower end of the BMI scale (19), but my gyno said that since I bled, I probably don't have HA. Even so, I read Nicola Rinaldi's book No Period, Now What?, and since then I've cut out running in favor of gentler exercise & gained to BMI 20.5 just to be safe. 

My gyno also did an internal scan and blood test and found no evidence of PCOS (I don't have acne or hirsutism). Thyroid numbers were normal.

Then, only 3 weeks after the second withdrawal bleed, I had a really weird, anovulatory period (confirmed anovulation by temping). I was confused, but happy: maybe things were restarting! Now, months later, I've had multiple patches of fertile cervical mucus and one solitary positive ovulation test, but never any temperatures to confirm ovulation and no more periods (and yes, the pregnancy tests are all negative). 

I have made an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist, which of course I could not get before February of 2020. Now, I am heading home for the holidays and unable to stop crying or worrying. I had stupidly hoped I might be pregnant by this time, which then gave way to the stupid hope that I might even have had an ovulatory period by this time, but I am no closer to conceiving than I was on the pill.

I have heard time and time again ""it can take up to a year to regulate after going off the pill"". But I haven't even had one normal period, let alone regular cycles! I was regular before the pill. All the scientific literature I've read says there is 0 evidence that the pill caused this. I know I still have time, but I am not 25 anymore, which adds to the worry.

I am not looking for a diagnosis, but I am wondering....has anyone here had a similar experience? I am feeling so lost and alone. My best friend, who started trying around the same time as me, announced her pregnancy this week, which has made the tears come even more easily. I don't know how I am going to keep it together over the holidays (of course, everyone in my immediate family has kids except me, and I know there will be the usual questions).

I’m now 31 and he’s 30. We tried on our own for a year, then I was diagnosed with PCOS, but my husband has excellent counts and morphology/motility. Dr. was super optimistic—“have some Clomid, we’ll get you pregnant in no time!” 

6 rounds of Clomid and nothing. Made some of my cycles even longer than they already were and basically trashed my lining. 

So we went to an RE, who recommended IUI using Femara and trigger. Straightforward, relatively cheap. We got pregnant! And then we lost it at 7 weeks. 

IUI #2 and #3: nope. 

Go keto, lose a f**k ton of weight. Feel healthy and ready to try again. Miraculously get pregnant on our own and it’s a chemical. Get really sad but also excited, because we didn’t need help! 

Get pregnant again 6 months later without assistance. Everything looks good with a bunch of ultrasounds and monitoring. Lose that one at 9.5 weeks. 

We started down the road to IVF and the anxiety got to me. So we did some backpedaling and are trying another couple round of femara with TI. If this fails, we’ll be going forward with IVF in March. 

Between hearing the incredibly loud ticking of my biological clock and the anger I feel (at myself? The universe? I don’t even know anymore) I feel like I’m spiraling. And it’s impossible to not feel like a lot of this is somehow my fault. I smoked from age 14 to 29. I probably completely did my eggs in.

Has anyone been put on medication to treat it?

264,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Yesterday we learned our second transfer failed. I was feeling different from last transfer. Last time I felt nothing except some nausea but this time, I had cramps since day 7, and a strong one on day 11, thought my uterus was contracting as the embryo went deeper, but nope.

The most heartbroken part is that my husband was crying, really hard. Never had he been so emotional. His tears dropped on my face. I did not have the gut to look at his face. That would break me even more.

Now I am trying another cycle. Last cycle I had two top grade embryos that passed PGS, both were FET, I did ERA and found myself pre-receptive on day 5 PIO and adjusted the timing of PIO shots for the second transfer. I had high hope after doing all these but still failed. **What else could I try? Any suggestions please?**

Now with two transfers and one mock transfer for ERA, I have comparisons for PIO shots. For those struggle with the PIO pain, here is what works for me (lessons learned with pain)

1. **Pick the right needles** (I am small, 5.2 and 105 lbs. I am using 18g\*1.5 inch for drawing, and 25g\*1in for injection. I used 22G\*1.5 inch for injection before, and it was hell. I could not sleep could not walk and the pain was long lasting. After I changed the needle, the pain was gone 98%. Nurse won't advocate for you. They will just give you standard size.)
2. **Pick the right timing**. If it is possible, talk to your doctor and pick a time as far from sleep as possible so you have time for absorbing the medicine. My first cycle, I did it on 10:30 pm, and went to sleep afterward. Blood around the site had no time to circulate and the pain accumulated. My second transfer, I did it on 8:30 pm. The pain scale was 100 vs 2-5.
3. **Have an experienced nurse draw the circles**. (it needs to be higher than butt crack. draw them big so you could avoid lump areas)
4. **Heat the area until it is really hot and red**. (I used a bottle of water)
5. **Put the vial in a bowl of hot water**, at half height (do not merge the whole vial in water), so the PIO is heated before drawing.
6. **Stand on one leg, the loose the leg for the side that you will do the injection**.
7. **Do not squeeze** like you did when doing the ovulation injections but the opposite: tighten and flatten the area and make sure the needle has a flat surface to go in.
8. **Push the needle in fast**: put in my husband's words: like you throw a dart. If you hesitate and do it slow, it will hurt more.
9. **Push the PIO in REALLY slow**. My husband took 3-4 mins to do one injection: from putting the needle in until taking it out. This is really helpful. I could tell if we did it fast, the pain increased. The standard to understand how slow you should push the PIO in: if you can't feel the flow inside, then it is slow enough. But if you do feel it is flowing, then slow down.
10. **Change side according to your butt's sensitivity**. (For me, left butt is so insensitive that I gave it 4 shots in a row and change to the right butt for one shot. My left butt was giving a bit less pain after 4 shots than the right butt after one.)
11. **Moist warm compress afterwards.** I had a towel soaked in hot water and compress on the site for about 30 mins after the injection while I am using my laptop.

other tips:

Synera patch helps a lot but it was expensive for me ($15 a patch) and I had strong dizziness if I applied it for more than 20 mins.

After doing all these, my pain scale went from 100 to 2-5 in the mock and second transfer. I did not even have to take a brisk walk. I really hope these tips help you save the pains.

<p><a href=""/u/caresaboutstuff"">/u/caresaboutstuff</a> and I both joined the Mod Squad at the same time, over 2 years ago. In that time (and time before that), I got to know Cares on another level. We did many treatment cycles together and you could just tell that she genuinely cared about your emotional well-being. She has held up hundreds, if not thousands of men and women going through infertility with grace and compassion. Her dedication to protecting this sub and ensuring it stayed a safe space warms my heart.</p>

<p>So with that, after uncountable hours of volunteer time and love, my friend <a href=""/u/caresaboutstuff"">/u/caresaboutstuff</a> is stepping down as a moderator. Please join me and the rest of the mods in thanking her for her efforts. </p>

<p>As I always say when a mod steps down - We all owe her for protecting this science-based, no-bullshit, safe space to be bitter and honest and real. Thanks for everything Cares! Love you! </p>

I took off my engagement ring last night & started birth control pills. I don't even know how to look at my partner - he's showing me sides of himself that were probably there all along but I felt my clock ticking and perhaps I was clouded. Or perhaps this pain is causing confusion. I don't know what to trust.
