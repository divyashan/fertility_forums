0,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Since we get a lot of well-meaning husbands poking their heads in asking how to support their wives, I've made a master list of dos and don'ts. Hopefully providing a link to this post will be easier than answering the same questions every week, especially since these posters don't tend to stick around. I've written this in the context of male partners supporting female partners, but of course this is relevant to female partners who are not bearing the brunt of infertility treatments. 

**DON'T try to be the voice of optimism.**

Platitudes like ""Our day will come"", ""It's not that bad,"" ""I know things will work out in the end,"" or  ""we just have to stay hopeful"" can do more harm than good. It's kindly meant, but at this point in the game it comes across as ""You're not allowed to be sad."" It can be dismissive of her feelings, and knowing that you wish she would be less sad only adds to her burden. Don't try to make it better, just let her feel what she's feeling.

**DO listen and validate her grief**

Let her cry when she needs to. Acknowledge how she's feeling. Hold her, let her process the emotions, and let her know that you are right there with her.

There's nothing anyone can say or do to make the pain go away. All you can do is accompany her through the pain.

**DO recognize that she's probably normal**

Infertility is a prolonged grieving process - grief over not having the life you thought you would, in the way you thought you would. And as with all types of grieving, there is anger, isolation, and depression mixed in there. When dealing with infertility, it's perfectly normal to cry and be inconsolable for days or weeks after each failure. It's normal and acceptable to not be happy for others' pregnancy news, avoid events with pregnant couples and babies, and to distance yourself from relationships with people once they get pregnant or have kids.

That said, if your spouse is finding it difficult to function on a daily basis for an extended period of time or is lashing out at you or others in unhealthy ways, it may be worthwhile to pursue professional help.

**DO help to alleviate her responsibilities**

A little bit goes a long way to help her from feeling overwhelmed. Make dinner, help with chores, get her favorite chocolate, arrange date nights, provide distractions. If you're both overwhelmed, maybe splurge and hire a cleaning service. During treatments, offer to go to appointments, do her injections, get the heating pad ready, and anything else that can take the burden off of her and send the message that you're both going through this, even if she's taking the physical brunt of it.

**DO share your own pain**

It helps to tell your wife how you feel from time to time. Many men think they are most helpful by ""being strong,"" but it's nice to know that you're both on the same page. It's really hard when you're having intense emotions and your partner doesn't share them -- it's like the extra lonely cherry on top of the infertility alienation sundae.

**DO reassure her that you love her**

This is particularly true for couples where the medical issue is on her side. It's important to emphasize that ""WE,"" as a couple, have issues with infertility. Make sure she feels loved and knows that you aren't going anywhere (even if this seems obvious). Let her know that her ability to have children does not define her as a woman and you will always love and support her no matter what. Reassure her that she's not broken, and you're lucky to have her exactly as she is.

**DO address a future that includes potential failure**

Reassure her that if the outcome of your treatments is ultimately unsuccessful, you as a couple would be okay. It would be heartbreaking but you would be okay together. Admit that that's a real chance of failure, and it's a part of trying and really wanting for something that matters. Being able to talk about ""what ifs"" and not pushing them away immediately can help you both come to terms with your life together if this never works out - yes, it won't be what we wanted or planned at all and yes, it hurts and will hurt like hell, but it can be helpful to see that you'll still have a future together

**DO seek outside help if needed**

Many of the people here have found a lot of help in therapy (either individual or couples therapy) with someone experienced in dealing with patients with infertility. Since our society tends to be so silent on the topic of infertility, it can be helpful just to have a safe outlet to actually talk through all of the feelings being experienced.

Resolve has many local infertility support groups. And not to sound biased, but this subreddit can be pretty darn great for providing support - we encourage you (or your wife) to stick around and become part of this community, which has helped many people who have found themselves in a dark place during infertility.

**DON'T break this subreddit's rules when posting**

Any mention of successful pregnancies or living children should be limited to providing relevant context of your medical history. It's okay to say ""We had success three years ago after our first IUI"" or simply ""we're suffering from secondary infertility."" It's NOT okay to say ""We have a beautiful 3-year-old daughter from our first IUI."" If your post breaks this rule, edit it right now or you're gonna have a bad time.

**DO use the search function**

This sub gets asked this question a lot. You can find many relevant posts by searching this sub for ""help my wife"" or ""support my wife"". In fact, this post has shamelessly plagiarized the comments in many of these past posts, including the sampling below:

I went through just nine days of stims (same dosage the entire time: 412 Gonal-F units and 75 Menopur, and added Cetrotide about halfway through). At every monitoring appointment, whoever was performing my ultrasound would gush about how great everything was looking. Two days before egg retrieval, the RE told me that my follicles looked excellent and I had at least eight mature-looking, large follicles (most about 20mm) ready for retrieval, with about five additional smaller ones. I went into retrieval surgery yesterday expecting at least eight eggs. Instead, they retrieved just three. I was a total hyperventilating mess when I found out, and the RE who had performed my retrieval came to me and asked if we'd done anything wrong with the trigger shot. Of course we didn't, that we know of. She suggested that the trigger might have been from a bad batch, which would mean she would want to report the lot number to the manufacturer. My bloodwork would help identify if there was a problem with the trigger. She also wondered if the follicles that showed up on the ultrasounds were cysts all along. This was all a lot to take in as I was waking up from anesthesia. 

A different RE called this morning to report that just one of the three eggs retrieved was mature and successfully fertilized, and that they'll watch the one little embryo and report back on Thursday if it has survived. I tried asking her questions about what went wrong; was there anything in my lab work that indicates the trigger shot didn't work? She said it looked like the trigger worked fine, and she really had no idea what went wrong. This is extremely not comforting. I hope they'll have better answers for me soon. Something DID go wrong with the trigger, right, for only one single egg to be mature? How do I go from about thirteen follicles of varying size to just three follicles holding eggs, and only one of those was mature? Was 10,000 units of HCG trigger insufficient? Am I in ovarian failure?

I'm nearly 22 years old and last month, after 1 year of 'well timed intercourse' we found out through testing that I am basically going through a premature menopause. I'm 22!


The doctors aren't sure yet as to whether some of my own eggs can be harvested, further testing next week. However, they have told us to think about getting an egg donor.


We are having to take a loan out to even go through with IVF, there's nothing else we can do. I've wanted to be a mother my entire life, and now this.


I'm just wondering if any of you have similar experiences? I'm terrified the baby won't feel like my own baby despite the fact I have carried him or her, and the thought of my partners sperm mixing with another womans DNA really upsets me.

At the moment, once eggs are fertilized in vitro, they are left to develop. During this phase the doctors look at morphological features of the embryos, basically how they look under the microscope, to decide whether they are good or not for implantation. Not much more can be done since you don't want to disturb the delicate embryos. 

A very gentle, non-invasive technique is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, which is what makes MRI possible. Me and a good friend, another physicist, are bringing this technology down to the size of a single embryo. This will allow doctors to look at the chemistry inside the embryos, without touching them, putting more information in their hands to make a better informed decision. The technology is described in this scientific [article] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357791/).

We are still in the early stages of this project and, being physicists used to the darkness of a lab, we are a bit ignorant about the IVF process as it is experienced by a patient. To get a better understanding and to better focus our efforts we have made a survey, fully anonymous, that we hope some of you will fill out. It would be very helpful. Thank you in advance!

We were considering IVF instead of selective abortion. Throughout the process everything with my bloodwork and his sperm was fine, until my HSG. My fallopian tubes are blocked. I looked up the causes of blocked fallopian tubes and I saw that ENDO is one of the causes. I didn't push for a laparoscopy but my OBGYN suggested I might have ENDO two years ago and I feel like this basically confirms it. My RE is talking about me having surgery to remove the blocked fallopian tube.

I'm 24 (husband is 25) and I'm terrified. I've never tried for children, but I've always suspected that I would have difficulty have children. I actually think God is punishing me because I have so many other good things going for me. 

I guess I just wonder, can I trust my doctor? I feel betrayed because my OBGYN saw that there was fluid in my fallopian tube via ultrasound two years ago, but she didn't make it seem like a concern at all. Clearly it's a big fucking deal. 

She also didn't even recommend an RE to me when I told her my SO and I both had sickle cell. I was the one who asked her.

Hell, before my HSG, my RE said ""it's just a formality, it'll probably be fine"". 

I just feel like doctors have this tendency to downplay. They don't mention all of my options or things I should be concerned about. I'm particularly scornful because I suspect they neglect to recommend things because they assume I can't afford things because I'm young and black.

(1st cancelled due to dominant follicle, 2nd had 6 embryos... 2 are still frozen, the others were 1 CP, a miscarriage, and a flat negative, but we are doing another retrieval to bank embryos before throwing in my 2 frozen ones). We're DOR and MFI. I'm 36 and SO is 43. 

Today was my stim day 5 ultrasound... my RE did my scan.... and becomes alarmed at what he thinks is likely hydrosalpinx. It was this really swollen fluid filled area that wrapped around the ovary. And it hurt like fuck while he was pressing on it. 

He asks if I had a baseline. Yes, it was Thursday, and the fellow who did the scan said something about fluid outside the uterus, but ignored it. (My nurse says the images between the two days are strikingly different). So, my doctor said he'd get back to me with my blood work results and a recommendation, but that continuing the retrieval cycle is fine, but we'd likely switch to a freeze-all. 

I had an HSG 2 years ago and at least 2 saline sonograms and countless twatwandings. The most that's come up is a huge cyst/endometrioma that's been around for at least a year and a half. I know that hydrosalpinx can be missed on sonograms. I also understand that that hydrosalpinx fluid is like toxic biological flood water (inflammatory and who knows what stuff), so removing is best. Totally on board with that. 

What I don't quite understand is... what happened? Has it been there all along but small? Did a small opening close up and now it's swelling like a toxic sludge water balloon? Might it be to blame for my CP, miscarriage, negative FET? Is there something else that it can be? 

I don't know quite what the point of posting this all is. I'll see my doctor on Saturday for stim day 8 check and we'll definitely freeze any/all embryos from the cycle. He recommends an HSG. Do you think we can just skip the HSG and just do a lap? It seems sort of time-wasteful to do the HSG THEN have to do the lap anyway. If we do the lap, we can look for endometritis, endometriosis, whatever. Is that reasonable? What should I think about to ask my doctor about?

This is the second cycle in a row where we've gone in for Day 2/3 bloodwork/ultrasound and had to abandon the cycle because FSH levels are higher than they're looking for.

In March 2017, FSH level came back at 2.9 during initial testing, which we're told is a good result

We tried our first IUI cycle in September, all levels came back within acceptable range to proceed. Used Letrozole to stimulate follicle growth and Ovridel as a trigger, grew 2 nicely sized follicles, did back to back IUIs, took Endometerin until a negative beta.  Our doctor said he was really pleased with the cycle, didn't see anything of issue, and recommended we try again on the same treatment plan.

In October, on Day 2, FSH came back at 19.  Doctor prescribed a course of birth control (Mirvala) as a ""reset"".  Told us they're looking for an FSH level under 15 and we can give it a shot again next month.

Had a Day 3 workup this morning and just heard back that FSH came in at 17.  They're having us take the CoQ10 supplement ""Ubiquitol"" 200mg/daily to try and bring it down for next cycle.

1. Use the report button if something, anything, seems off to you. Often we will get several personal messages complaining about a thread or a post, and go to see that only one person has reported it, even though like... 10 people have messaged about it.

 If a post is reported a certain number of times, it is automatically REMOVED (yay!) to the moderation queue for us to deal with. When in doubt, report. It is anonymous! We can't tell who did it! Report spam. Report rule-breaking. I don't care if you think someone else has already reported it, you should report it too. 

2. Use the ""message the moderators"" button for a more complicated problem. Your post caught in the spam filter? Want to know if something is ok? That button is located at the bottom right hand corner of the page above the little box that has all of the moderators names in it. This will notify all of the mods and keep mod work out of individual mods PM boxes.

3. Do not engage. Once someone has pointed out to an OP (hopefully without too much vitriol, because everyone was newer once) that a rule has been violated, it is unnecessary and childish to dogpile on someone, no matter what kind of a crap day you are having or how good it feels. Often, the OP either deletes or amends their post, and just didn't know. It sucks if they didn't read the rules, but it's OK - everyone will survive. I used a word on the bot list in my very first post on here - the one about sperm and how they get around. And I thought I'd read all the rules.

If it doesn't resolve cleanly, just report and go about your day. Block the user so you can't see them anymore. Down vote if you must.

I then moved on to IVF- harvested 8 eggs and ended up with three three day embryos.  1st FET was negative, 2nd was a chemical pregnancy (HCG of 40 that did not double), and 3rd today came back negative (HCG of 1.4 lol what is that?)

I'm annoyed because I asked several people what it would feel like, and was repeatedly told 'just like a pap smear' and 'no, it won't hurt at all.' I see many women on here describing it as 'uncomfortable, but it doesn't hurt.' Say what!? That was NOT just like a pap smear. That was getting my cervix 'wiped' because no doubt it was crusted up with all those disgusting progesterone suppositories. It was 'let's crank this cervix open a bit' to get the tube in, which I was alarmed to see came out covered in blood. It was at least a minute of gut-curdling poking with that bloody tube which was not, as expected, 'uncomfortable', but extremely and deeply painful. WTF, people!? 

I feel like I wasn't prepared for this. I feel like this whole process has been very lacking in detail about how this would make my body feel, and I'm annoyed about it. 

I guess I'm still suffering residual annoyance about my cluelessness about what recovery from a general anaesthetic would be like. I now know that's no picnic.

My egg retrieval was last Wednesday and I was wiped out for 5 days. Going to work on day 3 was a mistake: thank goodness day 4 was the weekend. My belly was up like a puffer-fish and the bloating felt like an enormous fart that I just couldn&#39;t get rid of, with a side of &#39;someone&#39;s been poking my ovaries with a needle.&#39; </p>

<p>GAH! Maybe now that I&#39;ve written this out I&#39;ll be able to sleep.</p>

I then come out of the room and a coworker who I don’t work with often asks if I have kids.  I respond “not yet” and she respond “you are so lucky, everything changes once you have kids”.  I wanted to SCREAM “I WANT everything to change!”  It feels like every fiber of my being has been dedicated to making that happen, and that just felt like a slap in the face.

<p>I recently saw a patient G7P6 - showed up with 3 of her 6 children (all under 4yrs).  When I asked her if there was any chance of pregnancy she just responded “yeah, we’re trying”.  Meanwhile, she and her partner were completely ignoring the kids and snapping at them constantly. </p>

<p>I then come out of the room and a coworker who I don’t work with often asks if I have kids.  I respond “not yet” and she respond “you are so lucky, everything changes once you have kids”.

148,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi folks
I've been lurking for awhile, and am feeling like we are getting to a cross roads. So, I would like to offer my story, pose a few questions and hopefully garner some advice and support from this amazing community. Fair warning, our story is a long and complicated, so for those who are able to follow the complexities, you are amazing.

Part 1: My (/our) complexities:

First things first: I am a 28 year old woman. My husband and partner of 10 years is just a few years older than me. His story is not mine to tell, but he is unable to produce sperm. We have decided to use a sperm donor. We both wanted a sperm donor who looked like him, but because he is a ginger, this was harder than anticipated. In the end, we were able to find a donor we both really liked, looks very similar to my husband, and so went ahead and bought 3 vials to start. 
A little more about me... at the age of 18 I developed an allergy to my own progesterone. The doctors at the time tried to treat this by prescribing me progesterone to 'replace' my own-essentially taking a birth control back to back to prevent me from ovulating. Unfortunately by the time I was 24 I became allergic to the synthetic form of progesterone as well. (Autoimmune progesterone anaphylaxis, is the name of the condition... although recently research has shown that it isn't autoimmune in nature, just an allergy. So they are proposing it be renamed Progesterone Hypersensitivity). During a typical month I experience rash and hives. On a bad month I experience angiodema, asthma like symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, vaginal swelling. My allergy to endogenous progesterone is pretty well controlled by an IGe mediator called Xolair which costs several thousand dollars a month, but is considered class ""B"" for pregnancy, so safe. The ""gold standard"" treatment for APA is a hystorectomy. Most have it in their 30s so that they don't need to stay on expensive treatment, and can actually fully regain their quality of life. Of course, before a hysto I want a family. Even just one kid.

I haven't tried or been on any synthetic progesterone since we realized I had become sensitized to it a few years ago, and my RE is basically terrified to use any on me during this process. Although, there is a good chance that my xolair injections would take a fair stab at controlling any symptoms if we did try. There is unfortunately a lot of 'unknown' in this journey. 

For those who want to know more about this, yes it is possible to become pregnant and sustain a pregnancy with this condition. No, it is not known if i can pass this down to a child. Unfortunately as the condition is very rare (I'm the 22nd documented case), very little is known about it. I do have contact with other women who have this through the wonders of the internet- most have kids, many experiences miscarriages, some have trouble conceiving. Pretty mixed bag. Many actually have fairly good pregnancies once the placenta takes over progesterone production at the 12 week mark. 


Part 2: Our journey in AR-land thus far

The beginning stage focused mostly on my husband, as I was presumed to be fairly fertile. My only red flag was an AMH of 1.7 at the age of 28. My understanding is that a 1.7 is more in line with what someone in the mid 30s would experience. I've always been an old soul, and I guess this is reflected in my egg reserve? Ha!
However, with age on our side and what was described as a 'very healthy' antral follicle count, we assumed things would still go pretty well once we got the sperm donor rolling. 

We had our first failed IUI in September. We tried it completely naturally, with just a HCG trigger shot for timing. Post thaw our sperm sample contained 6 million motile sperm. Not the best, but passable. No dice.
Our second failed IUI was in October. This time we enlisted the help of 100mg clomid cycle day 2-7. I produced a ton of follicles, with my day 10 scan showing about 6 competing. By trigger day, there were 4. By the IUI 24 hours later, there were 2. Nice sizes, around 19 mm each. Triggered with ovidrel. However, post-thaw, our donor vial only contained 2.5 million sperm- yikes? No dice. 

Saw my RE Thursday morning for my day 3 cycle monitoring for IUI #3. She decided to prescribe Femera. I'm now on 5 mg Femera for 5 days. She was disappointed that my E2 level was already 210 on my cycle day 3. She says the usually only give the femera if it's still under 200. She decided it couldn't hurt, so we started it anyways.  She suggested that because I have low AMH (1.7) and she thinks this causes my body to push the process along a bit faster than it should.
We had a discussion about some of the barriers we are facing, namely the AMH and the low sperm count from the vials we purchased. Re: the disappointing sperm donor, she was more candid with me then she was at the IUI. When I frowned at the 2.5 million then, she brightly said ""Sharkyandro, it only takes 1!"". I guess she didn't want to be a debbie downer right before inserting the sample? Now she's saying she really would have liked to have seen the sperm count at at least 4 million post wash. Our sample was 2.5 million...pretty far off. We talked about the possibility of choosing a new donor and continuing with IUIs after this cycle (we already have 1 more vial left of this first donor we don't want to waste). It's going to be a nightmare trying to find another ginger donor. She presented our second option, of proceeding with this 3rd IUI and if it fails, buying another vial from this original donor and moving straight to IVF w/ icsi for our 4th attempt. 
Found myself crying while walking to work. Not sure why I'm so emotional. I guess I had hoped we would have been one of the lucky ones who this magically works for quickly with a few simple IUIs. 

Part 3- Discussion & questions
So our options are a completely natural IVF with no progesterone (I don't know about Stims yet? do they ever just stim with clomid/femera? would the injectable stims affect progesterone in any way?). I can take a break and try to convince my immunologist to do a desensitization protocol with me to see if I could potentially tolerate progesterone supplementation (research article re: success with this method for my condition http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(10)02734-2/abstract ). 
Has anyone ever done an IVF with no progesterone?
Anyone have advice on not being upset about low sperm count in purchased sperm, which I know made my husband feel pretty shit, considering he has zero.
My period came 5 days post beta this cycle. RE's facial expression was a bit puzzled but she stayed quiet. Is it possible I had a chemical that didn't show up on the beta? can clomid just cause a really long cycle? did I ovulate late despite the ovidrel thus our IUI was badly timed? Sometimes I wish she would disclose everything to me even if it isn't the most positive news.

Long story short, the IVF route is going to be a complicated one, which may have even less success than the IUIs. The fact that we are already looking into it, and that I could only afford one IVF, makes me feel like I'm getting to the end of my road already. :(

Edit: Just to add that I: lost 70 lbs to get very close to normal BMI, do acupuncture, take Vitamin D, DHA+EHA, Prenatals+Folic Acid, CoQ10, low dose asparin. Don't consume alcohol, smoking, caffeine, gluten and dairy.  

Update: Had a few long discussions with my husband today. About my worries about IVF maybe not being as affective with my limitations, and how I feel like maybe we didn't truly give IUI the shot it deserved with the shity samples we bought. So,husband and I spent the afternoon looking at Seattle Sperm bank and have chosen a new donor. We are going to go into the clinic first thing and put an order in, hopefully it'll arrive before our IUI#3, if not we will use up the vial we have already and use our new sperm moving forward.

149,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I posted a little while ago about my struggles getting started with the infertility process, and I thank you all for your motivation and advice! I just wanted to give a little update about how things are going so far, I'm still very frustrated. 

In October I was my OBGYN again, but I went to the OBGYN I saw back in February when I was having a lot of trouble with my menstrual cycle. His practice has an acute care clinic to get women in the next day when they are experiencing problems. He is the one who put me on progesterone to help jump start my ovulation again, and he seemed very open and willing to help. My other OBGYN is the one who didn't want to see me again until Next year. From now on, when I saw OBGYN, I mean the nice one.  

Anyway, my OBGYN saw me this month, but he said that he didn't think infertility testing was necessary yet. He said that even though I've been trying for a year, my visit with him in February changes things. He had suspected I was having anovultory cycles which were messing with my period. The progesterone he prescribed me seemed to normalize everything and I got back on a super regular schedule around April, so he's counting April as my starting date for trying to conceive. Then he said that sentence I'm so sick of hearing, ""you're young, give it a little more time, it'll happen"". UGH! He must have seen the frustration and disappointment in my face because he did eventually give in and order an AMH level for me and a semen analysis for my husband. He said bloodwork to check my ovulation wasn't necessary because my period had become so regular. 

My AMH level came back yesterday and it's 0.35. I don't know much about that level, but I know that a number that low is bad. I read that many times a woman with a number that low goes into menopause within 5 years. I'm 29!!!! I'm trying so hard not to get too upset before I talk to a doctor, but I didn't read anything promising about an AMH that low. Well I decided I was sick of following what I thought was the right process for getting myself checkout out and I called and RE myself and made an appointment. I should have listened to you all in the first place, but I thought that maybe these doctors were right not to worry and I was just looking into things too much. 

I see my new RE on Thursday, and I'm really excited. I saw that she has the highest pregnancy rates in the area and she's in the top 10 in the country. The first appointment is 2 hours, I don't know if that's standard or not, but I finally feel like someone is going to listen to me. I'm sorry for the rant, I can talk about this all day to my friends, but two of them got pregnant by accident and the other one never wants kids, it's just not something they fully understand.

Yesterday’s bloodwork confirmed third IUI didn’t work. Took clomid CD3-7, I had three good follicles, and husbands numbers were fucking fantastic, especially compared to his last few numbers. We also were able to use a fresh sample rather than frozen for the first time. I’d convinced myself it was our best shot yet. Hahahahahahahahahaha.   

When I asked my nurse about if we should do a fourth IUI she said it’s up to us. I’m still undecided and one of my concerns is this: I’m nervous about taking an EIGHTH round of clomid (100mg/day).  

Everything that I’ve read states that after six rounds it begins to increase your chances of side effects such as thinning your lining. During an ultrasound for my third IUI my RE said my lining looks good but I don’t know numbers. My concern is that if I do an eighth round of clomid I’m going to be thinning my lining before we get to the IVF step in January.  

I know I’m probably insane for worrying about this but you all know how easy it is to overthink and analyze Every. Single. Detail.  

I’ve emailed my clinic to ask regarding taking clomid an eighth time but would also love to hear from some of you who have been in this boat before. Would you go for it? Or would you be hesitant? If I’m being paranoid you can tell me!  

**UPDATE**: heard back from the nurse and she spoke to my RE regarding my questions and concerns. He feels doing a fourth IUI with clomid would be ok as they’ve been monitoring my lining for the last few cycles. But that if I want to switch to letrozole I can do that. They don’t want to switch me to injectables as I respond well to clomid (I had 4 and 3 mature follicles the last two rounds) and would be worried about me overresponding, which I understand.

Mr. Ampersand and I have finally jumped through the many months of testing and hoops and are starting our first Progesterone/Clomid/Trigger/IUI cycle! This is exciting. I got the OK from my clinic and immediately took my first Progesterone pill. I was excited for exactly 2 minutes.

Then I looked at my calendar and...oh my. The timelines are all so approximate. I might have a period while still taking progesterone. or maybe two weeks after I finish it. I might have follicles to trigger on CD 12, but maybe not until CD16 (if at all). All of this puts us beautifully right around Thanksgiving for this huge window of our potential IUI date. For which of course we will be out of town (thurs-sat) for the first time in many years (my MIL used to hate me, now she tolerates me and this is our first holiday visiting them....a 7 hour drive away from my home and my clinic...bah)

I'll get through this, and worst case I continue to be the worst daughter in law in her eyes and fly back the day after Thanksgiving for a Friday IUI with Mr. Ampersand and try to make up some excuse. But now I'm looking forward, next up is Christmas. and so many other things. 

Do you still schedule around these things? do you take breaks from cycle months when you have plans in the (huge??!?!?!?!) window that it may be ""go-time"" for your treatment? Does life end up on hold to pursue fertility treatments?

I've been on a long, slow journey through infertility. So far, my husband and I are still in the unexplained infertility category. After moving a few times and changing doctors a few times, I've started over on this process more than I would care to say and I haven't pushed this process on when I should have. That is my greatest regret so far in this journey. 

Well, now that I have finally gotten to the point where I can get my regular doctor to understand that I want to figure out what is going on with our fertility. I want to take the next step. Holy shit that was hard to accomplish! Well, I've been waiting for a referral to go through. I've heard nothing. So I take the initiative and call the referred doctor's office. No referral here. The woman on the phone was so nice and so helpful, so I can't get mad at her. I call my doctor's office, ""oh yeah, the referral was denied."" 

First of all, what? Second of all, shouldn't there be a notification of denial, so that I know that I can move to the next step? Well, yes, the insurance company should have emailed a denial letter.  No letter ever came, not to me or my husband. There goes another month down the drain. 

Also, while my own silent journey into hell is ramping up, there are 4 knocked up women in my office. Four... Now, there are 9 women total, including myself. Two have already reached menopause. So that leaves 7 women ""able"" to have children. One, that I would consider a friend, has been constantly talking about how she's 7 weeks and because of her petite frame she's already showing. I love this girl, she's wonderful. But 6 months ago, she and her husband were concerned that they couldn't conceive. I have shared my story with her. It seems now that it's expected to just smile and accept that anyone who gets pregnant gets to talk to the whole world about it. I just don't want to hear it, I don't care that suddenly you feel this or that. For many years, I have felt nothing. Why isn't it OK for you to know that you're killing me? Why, when I mention my struggles now, is it OK for you to gloss over it, like I never even said it? Suddenly you get what you and I both want most in this world and now you're entitled to indifference regarding me? I really don't feel like being friends with any of these women at the moment. 

I never expected direct indifference, to my face, from a friend. That was the hardest blow. 

The silver lining is that my husband and I have been losing weight. A lot of it, actually. It has improved our health and it has been noticed that we are both getting slimmer. 

I wish every happiness for all of the women in my office, and if I'm allowed to be a little contradictory, fuck you all at the same time.

I realize this is better than zero. We have been actively TTC since July ‘16 with not preventing since 2014, have tried several medicated cycles, RE discouraged IUI. 

At MY insistence, I had my husband see the reproductive urologist at our fertility clinic. My RE seriously has some complex where she refuses to tell my husband his SA is anything but “totally normal!” So I absolutely insisted he see the urologist against her recommendation based on all my factual damn independent research. 

After the urology visit, husband was positive for “large” bilateral varicoceles, I wasn’t at the appointment with him so I don’t know the grade. Also his estridol and testosterone ratio was off. The urologist strongly recommended varicocele surgery, retest blood and possible clomid, sent a large in-writing recommendation of pros and cons, with a strong leniency to surgery because of the grade of his varicoceles and the fact that they were bilateral and he is low or borderline on all SA perimeters. She recommended also we see the RE and discuss it with her, then follow up back with the urologist. They’re in the SAME CLINIC. 

I swear, we see the RE again today and she is literally rolling her eyes at everything the urologist said. “Varicocele surgery doesn’t work, and you are anovulatory and THAT is the problem”. I’ve literally told this woman at my last THREE appointments, I temp, with OPKs and CM checks and I’ve only had two anovulatory cycles in the last 15 months. She is dead set his sperm is not the problem. I’m so fucking frustrated. The entire year we have seen this RE, between two abysmal SAs, she’s refuses to recommend anything but more Femara. She literally told me “the urologist doesn’t see the entire picture”. She hadn’t even looked up the hormone results for my husband, she did it right in front of us. FUCK YOU!!!  She actually told me today “There’s no reason you should ever have to do IVF. Give it time”. It’s been three years bitch! Is my RE seriously going to bingo me?!?

Her whole line about ""A mature adult learns to process sadness and tolerate discomfort, and not punish others for it."" might be true but i dont think it applies to infertility. Honestly this kinda pissed me off. 

http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/11/childless-couple-vows-to-end-friendship-over-kids/

There's the link, but if you dont want to click, here's the jist. Basically the person writing for advice has a friend who dealt with infertility who doesn't want to be friends if the writer has children. I just think the answer was incredibly tactless and rude. Here's the response from the ""advice"" columnist.

 - ""I’m going to try to draw a parallel. Many of my cohorts still have their parents (mine are gone now). This can make me feel both sad and jealous. But do I want my friends to share my orphaned state in order to relieve my own sadness? No. Do I sever the friendship because they are busy taking care of their elderly parents? No. A mature adult learns to process sadness and tolerate discomfort, and not punish others for it. Granted, babies have a way of turning their parents’ world inside out. Friendships do shift and sometimes end as a result. If this couple wanted to, they could easily find fulfilling ways to have children in their lives, including developing important relationships with their friends’ children. But they don’t want this, probably for very complicated reasons.

It really rubs me the wrong way. Her whole line about &quot;A mature adult learns to process sadness and tolerate discomfort, and not punish others for it.&quot; might be true but i dont think it applies to infertility. Honestly this kinda pissed me off. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/11/childless-couple-vows-to-end-friendship-over-kids/"">http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/11/childless-couple-vows-to-end-friendship-over-kids/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s the link, but if you dont want to click, here&#39;s the jist. Basically the person writing for advice has a friend who dealt with infertility who doesn&#39;t want to be friends if the writer has children. I just think the answer was incredibly tactless and rude. Here&#39;s the response from the &quot;advice&quot; columnist.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;I’m going to try to draw a parallel. Many of my cohorts still have their parents (mine are gone now). This can make me feel both sad and jealous. But do I want my friends to share my orphaned state in order to relieve my own sadness? No. Do I sever the friendship because they are busy taking care of their elderly parents? No. A mature adult learns to process sadness and tolerate discomfort, and not punish others for it. Granted, babies have a way of turning their parents’ world inside out. Friendships do shift and sometimes end as a result. If this couple wanted to, they could easily find fulfilling ways to have children in their lives, including developing important relationships with their friends’ children. But they don’t want this, probably for very complicated reasons. I hope you will be honest in your reaction: “When you joke about or threaten our friendship over the issue of having kids, I don’t know how to react. What are you really trying to say?”</li>

I am switching insurance next year. Hence I started researching for second opinions to help me decide if I want to switch clinics/RE. I am just sharing this experience.....

I should say upfront that, RMACT have been pretty good so far. Very responsive, smooth billing, accessible nurse and Doc. They email me off hours and weekends and always call in a timely manner. I just want to see if I was missing anything and do my due diligence. I may even decide to stay with them.

I prepped beforehand by collecting my full medical records.
I researched clinics using fertilityiq, Dr Google and Reddit.

1st I tried RMANY - it was easy to get a phone consultation with Dr. Klein. They charged me $300 for the call, billing dept showed me how to file a claim form with my insurance, both billing team and Dr. were happy to answer follow-up questions very promptly via email.
During the consultation, he went through my medical notes and prior egg retrievals and provided his thoughts on what he would suggest doing next.

2nd option was Weill Cornell - based on the experience of trying to book an appointment I was put off.
They said that phone consultations were $650 that could not be billed to insurance. I asked if an office visit could be billed, and was told yes. And starting going down the path of in face meeting instead.
I was interested in speaking to Dr Elias and Dr Reichman to help decide who I wanted to work with.
This is where it got strange.
I called Dr Elias' office and scheduled the consultation
I called Dr Reichman' office and tried to schedule an appt. I was told Dr Reichman has a policy, that he does not accept transfer of other patients within the group. So if I see Dr Elias first, I am not allowed to book a consultation with Dr Reichman.?!!
I guess he doesn't want to be pitted against his colleagues in the same group?
I am going to keep my appt with Dr Elias and see how that goes.......

Update: the policy is a Weil Cornell group policy. You can not switch between REs once you start.

How have your experiences been when switching?

<p>I should say upfront that, RMACT have been pretty good so far. Very responsive, smooth billing, accessible nurse and Doc. They email me off hours and weekends and always call in a timely manner. I just want to see if I was missing anything and do my due diligence. I may even decide to stay with them.</p>

<p>I prepped beforehand by collecting my full medical records.
I researched clinics using fertilityiq, Dr Google and Reddit.</p>

<p>1st I tried RMANY - it was easy to get a phone consultation with Dr. Klein. They charged me $300 for the call, billing dept showed me how to file a claim form with my insurance, both billing team and Dr. were happy to answer follow-up questions very promptly via email.
During the consultation, he went through my medical notes and prior egg retrievals and provided his thoughts on what he would suggest doing next.</p>

<p>2nd option was Weill Cornell - based on the experience of trying to book an appointment I was put off.
They said that phone consultations were $650 that could not be billed to insurance. I asked if an office visit could be billed, and was told yes. And starting going down the path of in face meeting instead.
I was interested in speaking to Dr Elias and Dr Reichman to help decide who I wanted to work with.
This is where it got strange.
I called Dr Elias&#39; office and scheduled the consultation
I called Dr Reichman&#39; office and tried to schedule an appt. I was told Dr Reichman has a policy, that he does not accept transfer of other patients within the group. So if I see Dr Elias first, I am not allowed to book a consultation with Dr Reichman.?!!
I guess he doesn&#39;t want to be pitted against his colleagues in the same group?
I am going to keep my appt with Dr Elias and see how that goes.......</p>

<p>Update: the policy is a Weil Cornell group policy. You can not switch between REs once you start.</p>

<p>How have your experiences been when switching?</p>

I know that when I was going through stims I devoured any kind of data post about dosing, follicle count, retrieval numbers, etc. So I took really good notes during my recent cycle and thought I'd share here. 

The stats: I'm 30f with 30m partner. I have endometriosis, presenting with one large cyst (at least before stims) on my right ovary and gastric symptoms. We also have MFI (low everything, 2mil count) and so had never done any interventions before this stims cycle. 

**Meds - Types and Doses**

 * I was on 15 days of BCP suppression.

 * I started 225 of Gonal-f and 50 cc of microdose HCG on evening of 10/1 (so 10/1 bw values below are baselines). I continued at that dose for a total of 3 nights.

 * I moved up to 300 of Gonal-f and 50 of HCG and stayed there for 7 more days total in the evenings. My last evening med dose was 10/10. 

 * I added cetrotide as a holding med on 10/6, and took 6 doses total. 

 * I triggered with lupron at 8 pm on 10/11, had b/w to confirm surge 10/12, and had my retrieval 10/13. 

**Bloodwork Values**

Date| E2 pg/mL | Progesterone nmol/L
---------|----------|----------
10/1 | 17 | n/a
10/4 | 267 | n/a
10/6 | 938 | n/a
10/9 | 2,850 | 2.1
10/12 | 9,060 | 16.0
10/13 | n/a | 60.72

**U/S Results - Follicle Counts, Ovary Size**


**10/1 Ultrasound - Baseline**

Lining: 1.2 mm

*Right Ovary*: 32 x 25 x 24 mm with 13 x 10 x 13 mm debris filled cyst

AFC: 12-13 < 10mm 

*Left Ovary*: 24 x 19 x 18mm

However, in my first, and now my second, FET cycle, my lining has gotten to 7.96mm (in my 1st) and 7.21mm (in my 2nd), and then progressively gotten smaller. In fact, the more estrogen they put me on (I’m currently on cream (2 mg), patches (3), pills – both orally and vaginally, gel, and ring form), the more my lining seems to shrink.

In both cycles, I peaked while on lower-dosages of estrogen, only to see my lining get smaller at each successive lining check. I did not experience any bleeding.

I am currently on Lupron, Gonal-F (as a way to stimulate my ovaries into producing their own estrogen), the aforementioned estrogen, vaginal Viagra, Vitamin E, L-Arginine, CoQ10, a prenatal with DHA, baby aspirin, and Folgard. In this current cycle, they did three GCSF washes and an “endometrial disruption,” which culminated in no difference, as evidenced by today’s lining check, which measured me at 5.6 mm.  

Each FET cycle was preceded by a hysteroscopy. It seems like the harder we try, the worse conditions get.

Three months ago, I had an ectopic pregnancy. It was my fourth cycle of Clomid and second IUI. That was tragic in and of itself. You would think that would be enough to go through for a while, right?

Then about two months ago, I noticed I was having difficulty hearing in my right ear. It got quickly and progressively worse over several days. Sometimes it was painful and almost always accompanied by very loud ringing and humming in that ear. Multiple doctors put me on all sorts of drugs. In the end, diagnosed with sudden sensorineural hearing loss triggered by some sort of autoimmune response because of my rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment? Heavy steroids and a steroid injection into my middle ear (scheduled for next week).

Oh and did I mention I’m a musician and the hearing loss also created a pitch differential between my two ears? Diplacusis is what I learned it’s called. Music has been intolerable to listen to for weeks and very hard to make music, which was one of my ways to relax when stressed or sad about infertility or anything else. With steroids, all of that is getting better but there isn’t an end in sight to the treatment at the moment. So no getting pregnant for me for a while.

But even that is not enough. Due to something....stress, weight loss (I’ve lost 45 pounds since February), Clomid, the methotrexate I had to take for the ectopic, the steroids, or who knows what, now I’M LOSING MY HAIR.

On top of everything, my hair is drastically thinning and falling out. I bought a $300 wig today. I’m not using it yet but wanted to be prepared rather than panic if the day comes that the thin patches turn to bald spots. And the way my hair is looking, the day is not far off.

<p>But even that is not enough. Due to something....stress, weight loss (I’ve lost 45 pounds since February), Clomid, the methotrexate I had to take for the ectopic, the steroids, or who knows what, now I’M LOSING MY HAIR.</p>

<p>On top of everything, my hair is drastically thinning and falling out. I bought a $300 wig today. I’m not using it yet but wanted to be prepared rather than panic if the day comes that the thin patches turn to bald spots. And the way my hair is looking, the day is not far off.</p>

<p>I don’t think I can take anymore. After all this, still no baby to show for any of it. Fuck everything.</p>

Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm new to Reddit, and finally decided to create an account so I could post here. 

My husband and I have been trying (off and on) since July 2012. Our official diagnosis is ""unexplained infertility,"" which frustrates the living shit out of me. There's nothing obviously wrong with either of us--all tests check out totally normal. I'm 33 and don't have any health issues, and my husband is 35, and also completely healthy. Our doctor literally scratched his head and said ""well kids, I'm stumped."" Thanks. So glad I'm paying you thousands of dollars. 

I might be a little salty today. Sorry.

We've done five failed rounds of IUI (2 with Clomid and 3 with Gonal-F) and are now gearing up for our first IVF attempt later this year. 

Anyway, I decided to stop lurking and finally make an account because I love this subreddit. I love how honest everyone is. I love how supportive everyone is. I love that you don't tolerate those stupid cutesy acronyms that make me want to stick a fork in my eye. I love that you post trigger warnings for movies and TV shows. 

I've found that while my friends and family mean well, very few of them have been truly understanding and empathetic, and in fact I've lost a close friend because she just didn't have it in her to be sensitive to what I've been going through. I have one friend who's been through the IVF process (and successfully), and she's been a huge source of support. Feeling understood by someone else is another reason why I've decided to come out of the shadows.

<p>We&#39;ve done five failed rounds of IUI (2 with Clomid and 3 with Gonal-F) and are now gearing up for our first IVF attempt later this year. </p>

<p>Anyway, I decided to stop lurking and finally make an account because I love this subreddit. I love how honest everyone is. I love how supportive everyone is. I love that you don&#39;t tolerate those stupid cutesy acronyms that make me want to stick a fork in my eye. I love that you post trigger warnings for movies and TV shows. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that while my friends and family mean well, very few of them have been truly understanding and empathetic, and in fact I&#39;ve lost a close friend because she just didn&#39;t have it in her to be sensitive to what I&#39;ve been going through. I have one friend who&#39;s been through the IVF process (and successfully), and she&#39;s been a huge source of support. Feeling understood by someone else is another reason why I&#39;ve decided to come out of the shadows. </p>

<p>Anyway, hello everyone. Sucks that we&#39;re all here. </p>

Spouse and I have been trying for 2 years, and it looks like male factor is our main issue...

We just had an appointment this morning with our RE following our first failed IUI. She said that the sperm count was low enough on this first go that we have maybe a 5% chance of conceiving this way, but we could keep doing IUI or switch to IVF. I'm bummed because I foolishly had in my head that IUI might work for us (first semen analysis looked like mild male factor, but now it's looking more severe :/)  and our insurance covered half the cost of IUI but covers nothing on IVF. 

RE estimates total cost of one cycle of IVF and possible FET(s) at 25k (including all meds, ICSI, genetic testing, etc.) Does this seem reasonable? I've done some looking around, and some other places offer risk sharing plans/multiple cycle discounts that look a tad lower but may not include all the extras like ICSI. Realistically we would have to put this on a credit card and wouldn't have any more credit available for another retrieval if this didn't work. RE says we have 80-90% chance of success from 1 retrieval though I'm a little skeptical. I'm torn because I like our RE and the idea of starting IVF immediately with next cycle is appealing (RE has said time is of the essence and we'd want to do it within next 6 months). But I also don't want us to be shooting ourselves in the foot / making a terrible financial decision if we'd be likely to get a much better / smarter price / package elsewhere. How do y'all navigate making this decision and figuring out what is / is not a good value?

269,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all, 

Long time lurker, first time poster here. My name is /r/DefinitelyNotABoner. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 15 after having my period for 8 months straight. I am obese, though currently losing (35lbs down so far!) through keto and exercise. My husband and I have been trying for about 18 months cumulative (though 12 months total now since we took a few month break after trying for about 6 months before) and had our first RE appointment yesterday. 

I guess I'm posting here because honestly no one in my real life really gets this. I'm at an age where a lot of my friends and family have been asking about ""when"" we'll get started, and even if I'm 100% honest and transparent about our stuggles I end up getting bingoed about their friend's sister's mother has had four successes since she last relaxed. Thankfully my partner is wonderfully loving and supportive, and he lets me bitch and moan about this as much as I want (a lot). 

I think for a while I felt like I didn't really deserve to even post here since many of you have been here much longer with much more difficult journeys so far, but after the RE yesterday I'm pretty overwhelmed by the information. I'm having an ultrasound on Monday (I honestly can't remember why). I have a dermoid tumor on one of my ovaries that is going to be removed soon, and my RE also suspects Endometriosis. I've been doing keto, but their practice puts all of their PCOS patients on a keto diet as the first step for interventions. At least I have that going for me. :)

I think the next step is a Hysteroscopy and HSG at my next cycle. **(Edit: He is also doing an HSG during my Hysteroscopy - thank you! That helps when googling.)** ~~Totally not sure if that is the name of the procedure.~~ There was something about a catheter and checking to make sure my tubes were open. I just know it also involved a day off work and Lortab/Xanax for the appointment. Has anyone had any experience with this? I'm a bit nervous because I've only ever really had my wisdom teeth out other than this and transvaginal ultrasounds. Is it super painful or just relatively uncomfortable? I'm not used to being so uninformed about stuff like this, but all of the information at the appointment was a lot and it was difficult to absorb everything. My husband will also be getting a SA at my hysteroscopy appointment.

Anyways, I don't have a huge support system about all of this other than my husband. I'm looking forward to interacting with you all and learning more about this process.

279,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'm sure this topic has been debated to death here but my wife and I could really use some input on our situation.

We're both 30.  Last year we did 2 IVF cycles, both with PGS.  

First cycle we had 8 eggs, 2 were too big or small to use, 2 did not fertilize, and 1 did not survive the first 3 days.  3 embryos made it to day 3 and were tested and all 3 came back genetically abnormal so nothing was transferred.

Second cycle we had 9 eggs, 8 fertilized and made it to day 3 and were tested, and only 2 came back normal.  Both transferred at the same time but neither implanted.

Now we are considering trying IVF again and need to decide if we would do PGS again or not.  We're really torn because we've read some studies that suggest that some PGS abnormalities might be false positives and some embryos could get damaged in the process.  Also since last year our clinic has changed their process so all PGS biopsies happen on day 5, which means the embryos all have to be biopsied, then frozen, then thawed, than transferred.  Seems like a lot that can go wrong.

Part of the concern is also cost.  Most of our IVF costs will be paid out of pocket to the tune of $12,000 for the base cycle.  PGS is another $2,500 for the biopsy plus $2,500 to the lab, plus the cost of a frozen cycle so all together it's an extra $8k-$10k on top of the $12k we'd already be paying.

BUT if we don't do PGS we will likely pay more for failed transfers.

Financially speaking the most we can afford to spend on IVF this year is around $25k.  If we do not do PGS then we could probably do 2 cycles (if needed).  If we do PGS then we're probably limited to 1 cycle.

<p>BUT if we don&#39;t do PGS we will likely pay more for failed transfers.</p>

<p>Financially speaking the most we can afford to spend on IVF this year is around $25k.  If we do not do PGS then we could probably do 2 cycles (if needed).  If we do PGS then we&#39;re probably limited to 1 cycle.</p>

<p>What would you do?</p>

Perhaps an interesting read to some.

According to this study:
Question  
Is diminished ovarian reserve, as measured by low antimüllerian hormone (AMH), associated with infertility among women of late reproductive age?

Findings  
In this time-to-pregnancy cohort study of women aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility, women with a low AMH value had an 84% predicted cumulative probability of conception by 12 cycles of pregnancy attempt compared with 75% in women with a normal AMH value, a nonsignificant difference.

Meaning  
Among women attempting to conceive naturally, diminished ovarian reserve was not associated with infertility; women should be cautioned against using AMH levels to assess their current fertility.
