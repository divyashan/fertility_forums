She gave me one cycle of Clomid, had my husband complete a SA, then shut us down when his numbers were less than great.</p>

<p>We’ve finally consulted with a RE and are planning an IUI with Femara and possibly (probably) Ovidrel for this cycle. I went in for my Femara check ultrasound this morning and my AFC was absurdly high at 136 (74 left and 62 right)! My nurse said it’s the highest she has ever seen. Has anyone else out there had an AFC this high? I’m freaking out that we’ll either have too many follicles develop and have to cancel, or they’ll all be total shit and nothing will mature. Any advice/experience greatly appreciated!!</p>

I just had a failed FET.  It was my only embryo that froze in my first round of IVF in August.  

Last month, I went to Dallas to consult a new RE.  (I live around 5 hours away in another state) The goal was / is to get everything ready for me to be able to do a round of IVF (stims/retrieval only) before the end of the year.  I have met my insurance max and everything is covered 100% until Jan 1 2019.

But insurance required me to try the FET before they’d pay for another round of IVF.  I did that and got the negative preg test on Tues.

I am supposed to call the new clinic when I start my period and I will then start birth control pills.

Problem is that I don’t ever know how long my cycle will be (when I will start my period). I emailed the new IVF coordinator a few weeks ago to ask several questions.  She replied and said she call me the next week, but I never heard from her.

I emailed her again on Wed with “please call me” in the subject line.  I also called and left a voicemail for her around 11am today.

I have so many questions and I’m kinda pissed I haven’t heard back from her.  Is this normal?? I guess I can call the new patient coordinator but the doctor introduced this nurse to me as if she’d be the liaison for me setting up my care plan.

I know a number of us are in places with horrific air quality right now from the wildfire situation in CA. Last night readings were showing AQI of 492 in our neighborhood (!!!). 

We are doing our best to stay inside and minimize exposure (my husband and I are both asthmatic), but there’s only so much you can do.

I’m due to start my period for a FET cycle any day now, so I did some Googling of preconception exposure to PM 2.5 (the most dangerous element of the wildfire smoke). Short story is there are a number of studies (several linked below) that show an association between preconception exposure (1-3 months, depending on the study) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth, birth defects). 

However, it’s unclear to me if any this heightened risk would apply to a pregnancy in which the embryos were created in the past. 

Those of you who either have medical backgrounds or are also in high pollution situations, how are you thinking about this? Have you talked about it with your doctors? How are they advising you? I’m worrying and wondering whether I should postpone my FET again, even though I’m mid-protocol (already took Lupron Depot). 

Anyway, here’s some articles if you want to dig in:

Here's the background on my protocol and the cystic twist. (Apologies for lengthiness.)

Birth control suppression for 3 weeks. On week 2 of this, they found a 20mm cyst at the mock transfer. A week later at baseline, the cyst grew to 30mm and my E2 was over 200. Another week of birth control and the cyst was still there (a little smaller but not much) but E2 was 35. We got the clearance to start stims 3 days after stopping birth control.

I stimmed with 150 Menopur + 300 Gonal F. Day 4 scan showed a 20mm cyst, a 10mm follicle, and 9 smaller, unmeasurable follicles. We were glad at this result because I was worried of being oversuppressed. Day 6 scan: cyst now 24mm, one follicle at 14mm, no other measurable ones, E2: 293. Day 8 scan (today): cyst 30mm, 3 follicles at 16, 11, and 7. RE agreed that it's unlikely much will change even if we stim for another 2 days, and that we should get off the IVF train now. I can either stop or continue with IUI.

I originally thought the leading/dominant follicle was to blame. But in RE's opinion, the cyst became active again with stims, hogged the drugs, and prevented the follicles from developing. But if that's the case, wouldn't continuing with an IUI also yield poor results because of the active cyst? I blew through more than half of my meds already and would hate to ""waste"" more on an IUI cycle that could have lower odds of success than typical (because of the active cyst). At the same time, going with an IUI seems better than nothing since I've used up half of the meds already (some chance is better than no chance?). It feels like I've already lost, no matter which option we take.

I've read about IVF cycles being cancelled due to cysts at baseline, or being cancelled midway through stims because of a dominant follicle leading to few follicle growth, but not about a reactivate cyst, so add that to the never-ending list of things that can go wrong in IVF.

I'm waiting to hear back from the RE on her opinion. In the mean time I'm curious what you guys think. I'll update with RE's input later so that others in the future can know what to expect.

Thanks.

ETA: RE's advice was to do IUI because ""15% is better than 0"" and she doesn't think the cyst will interfere with the growth of the lead follicle.

I'm sorry if this is scattered.  My brain is a bit of a mess right now.

My husband and I have been trying for well over a year and recently this feels like one gut punch after another.

First came the endometriosis diagnosis, followed by fibroids, and now PCOS.  My husband's semen analysis didn't come back as great as we hoped.  Our RE seems to think his sperm might still be good enough and wants us to try a few cycles before we hop over to IVF.

Fun fact: my last cycle was 86 days.  And I don't ovulate every cycle.

My RE wants to start me on progesterone (to bring on my cycle) and then Letrozole (for ovulation), which seems to be pretty straight forward, but he wanted to send me for blood work first, just to be safe.

Turns out, my body has purged itself of any evidence of the chicken pox vaccine.  Apparently that's rare but not unheard of.  Joy!

So, now I have to get the vaccine before he will start me on medication.  

There are two possible vaccines.  The first, Shingrix, is very much preferable because it's not a live virus.  I've called over a dozen different places around me.  NONE of them have the vaccine.  There is ONE manufacturer and they are backed up.  The most optimistic timeline I got from any pharmacy is end of January.

I called my RE and let him know.  He told me to get the live vaccine and we'd just push off starting meds for another 2 months (because it's a 2-part series and you have to wait a month between).  

So, after I calmed down and wiped away the tears, I started calling pharmacies.

NONE of them carry the live virus anymore because Shingrix is so popular.

I'm still waiting to hear back from the Department of Health, but I'm not optimistic.

30,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I had a medicated IUI with menopur/ovidrel. 

Ovidrel is a prefilled subcutaneous injection, and there were a few steps involved in it's preparation, including unsheathing the needle. I stupidly thought it would be like an epipen, so I started to inject but the medicine went on me and that's when I realised my mistake.

I panicked and saw that maybe 3/4 was wasted on me, and I injected the 1/4 that was left.

I was then in tears and a real wreck because I went through all the menopur injections and scans for nothing as I messed up the important trigger shot.

I called up my clinic and told them the situation. It's never happened before. But a consultant said it would be fine to come in quickly and they gave me a whole dose of ovidrel.

 Would this have any effect on how many follicles I would ovulate because technically it's a small overdose? I had 2 mature follicles according to the scan.

I was on the verge of tears during the entire appointment, and felt so vulnerable in front of this medical professional who just seemed to be a statistics machine.

My husband and I have been trying to conceive almost three years now. We received a diagnosis of unexplained infertility and the RE proposed starting fertility treatment right away (IUI then IVF if unsuccessful). I feel very hesitant about starting treatment though and not emotionally ready, but I wonder if I am just putting off the inevitable. The doctor said that given our results, there is no reason to say we can't conceive naturally, but statistically, we have a 5% chance each month without treatment (those are not great odds).

But it just seems strange to me to start a medical treatment when there is no medical reason for our inability to conceive (or at least, it hasn't been discovered). I am just having a hard time wrapping my head around this. The increased odds for multiples does worry me, mostly because it makes the pregnancy more risky for both the mother and babies.

I feel very hesitant about starting treatment though and not emotionally ready, but I wonder if I am just putting off the inevitable.

<p>But it just seems strange to me to start a medical treatment when there is no medical reason for our inability to conceive (or at least, it hasn&#39;t been discovered).

Hello and I hope it's okay to post here. A friend of mine mentioned this sub and said you might have some advice, I hope it's okay but the IVF sub doesn't seem very active.

I am 25 and my husband is 38. He is a carrier of Neurofibromatosis type 1, he isn't affected that much but he had a sibling die at a young age due to agressieve cancer caused by the disease. 

We had discussed children in the future but it wasn't really something we had seriously looked into and we didn't have a lot of information concerning my husbands condition. 
This summer we had an unexpected pregnancy, we where unsure of how to react then we did some research into neurofibromatosis and saw that the chances where 50/50 for being positive and a 1 in 3 chance of being born with cancer. We had agreed to do prenatal testing but before we got to 10 weeks I miscarried. 

My husband managed to keep a level head , and though I would love to try again natural, he said it might be better to go forward with IVF and PGD. I was also thinking of starting a master's next year and my husband said maybe we should put off any processes for a few years untill I'm more settled in my career.

Would it be better to start sooner then later? I don't want to put it off for a few years and then processes take so long that it affects our chances of conceiving through PGD/IVF. 
My husband will potentially be in his 40's and though he said it won't have an affect on our chances I'm not sure.  
If it helps we are currently living in The Netherlands so insurance may cover it but there is a waiting list of up to two years from what I've read on clinic webpages.

Me: 34 (going on 35 in April) woman

Husband: 33 year old man with a type of muscular dystrophy (mild in his case, but we know it could be more serious for future generations)

&#x200B;

Neither one of us has issues with infertility (though neither one of us has tried to start a family before), but we are ready to start our family and we realized that the only way to try to prevent a child from getting my husband's genetic condition would be through PGD and IVF. Otherwise it's a 50/50 gamble.

&#x200B;

Pro: we live in a country where the government will pay for IVF under these circumstances since we do not already have children. They do not cover IVF for anyone who  already has a healthy child (so this would not be an option in the future)

&#x200B;

Con: The waiting list for the first doctor's appointment is 14 months as of today (we just put in the request to have my husband's genetic results reviewed today, after which  we expect our request would be approved and we would be put on the waiting list.. so 14+ months starting from that point)

&#x200B;

Plan B: Tomorrow we have an initial appointment at a private fertility clinic, where the cost of PGD + IVF will probably be around 8-10k euro. We have the money but it's still not an insignificant expense. 

&#x200B;

I know it's a tough decision and one no one else can make for us. I know you can't really put a price tag on a healthy child. 

&#x200B;

Still, the super frugal part of me wants to wait to get the free IVF through the government... but then, barring some miracle where we can get an earlier appointment, I know I will likely be 35 going on 36 before we even meet with the gov't doctors for the first time

&#x200B;

Then again, we would ideally want to have at least a few children. So, having the first one at 36 or 37 when I could have potentially had the first one at 35 seems like ... not the best idea. And I know ultimately if we waited and things don't go well, I would never forgive myself... so perhaps therein lies my answer? 

&#x200B;

For now, our plan is just to go to the private clinic and get all the info, and get on the government waiting list... but we would need to make a decision soon about which path to take. 

&#x200B;

Any advice or feedback? Again, I know this is ultimately a decision we will need to make ourselves, but I'm curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation? 

&#x200B;

Right now we are kicking ourselves for not investigating this earlier, but c'est la vie, I guess.

71,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Looking for some feedback: Over the past 5 years I have had 5 transfer failures and 1 miscarriage, all with PGS tested embryos. Two occurred when I had a hydrosalpinx, which was repaired surgically. The rest have been subsequent to that. 4 embryos were 5 or 6 AAs or ABs, two were 4 A/Cs. Since the hydropsalpinx, all other structural issues have been ruled out. I have had genetic testing to rule out genetic issues with the embryos. I've used lovenox and steroids during transfer to try to throw everything at the wall.

&#x200B;

I spoke to my doctor yesterday and he said obviously I'm in the land of statically improbability and something is going on with my uterine receptivity. He suggested another endometrial biopsy (scratch---I have had three) and suggested the Endometrial Receptivity Analysis. It just became available in my city. He was straight up that he was skeptical of the data but he really had nothing else to offer me.

At this point, having been totally out of pocket all these years, we are stretched to the end of our emotional and financial resources. I am out of embryos, and I can't justify doing another retrieval cycle only to get a embryo or 2 (I have a decent AFC/AMH but I'm 39) only to throw it in my uterus and fail again. I've resisted the world of reproductive immunology because I haven't found the science compelling but I seem to have reached the end of help I can get from interventions that have good RCT backing.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. Maybe:

&#x200B;

* Has anyone had this kind of multiple failures of ""good"" embryos? Anyone want to commiserate?
* Any done an ERA and gotten useful information? Can you tell me about the cost?
* Any other thoughts/feedback about where to go from here? I keep circling around the idea it's time to throw in the towel.

80,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey guys.  A little about me: 31 years old (husband is 36)... we have the scary ""unexplained"" infertility diagnosis. We have been TTC for over 2 years (1 year now of ART), 3 IUIs, 1 IVF with 4 PGS normal and excellent quality embryos - FETs resulted in 3 very early chemical pregnancies and 1 failure.

&#x200B;

I went for a second opinion at a clinic that supports immune testing, but everything came back negative.  The only thing that came back positive was the ReceptivaDx test.  My results:

&#x200B;

* BCL6= abnormal, H score of 3.1 (positive) -- associated with endometriosis
* Beta 3= normal, H score of 3.0 (positive) -- associated with implantation failure
* CD138= positive -- associated with chronic endometritis

&#x200B;

These results, of course, scare the crap out of me.  I've never had any symptoms that point towards endometriosis, and it is still argued whether endometriosis impacts fertility at all.  I had been previously been diagnosed with chronic endometritis and went through the stomach-murdering rounds of antibiotics before two of the FETs.

&#x200B;

The second opinion doctor recommends a laparoscopy, and I've already scheduled my pre-op appointment.  Surgery is scary, but this is also appears to be the only explanation left for my unexplained fertility. My original doctor thinks this is all nonsense, but he supports me having the surgery if it will potentially give me peace of mind.

&#x200B;

91,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I've commented on the chat threads and other posts, but this is my first time posting.  I joined Reddit to be an active member of this awesome community.


I'm a 34F, TTC >1yr, DOR, IUI x6 (3 Clomid, 3 Menopur), no MFI.  Scheduled for IVF in Feb 2019. We've been having issues with our current clinic (posted it on Friday AM chat)... scheduling issues, our original RE left, and then communication/administrative issues with the IVF team.  Unless some other big issue arises we will continue with them for our first IVF cycle (will lose $500 of our deposit if we choose to cancel). We're 100% out-of-pocket for IVF.


I'm a glass-half empty, extreme worrier and like to have a back-up plan...and a back-up back-up plan.  I've been researching other clinics in the bay area in the event that IVF #1 goes horribly and wanted to reach out to you guys to see if you have had any positive or negative experiences with any bay area clinics.  I saw a few older posts (most recent was a year ago) about this topic but wanted to see how people feel now.


What clinic are you at and do you like the care you've received so far?  Is there a clinic you left and what made you leave? Were CDC and SART success rates a factor in your decision?  I noticed that some clinics didn't report stats to CDC or SART. Do you find this alarming? (No shade to Dr. Aimee since I heard she is AMAZING despite not seeing any data reported). 


Anyone have experience at PAMF in the South Bay, CCRM SF (opened in 2017), Stanford, Nova, Bay IVF?  I'd prefer something closer to the South Bay, but as my husband pointed out, if we're willing to shell out $20-$25k per cycle then we should be willing to drive further if it means better care/service/chance for success.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! 



 UPDATE:  I want to thank everyone who responded on this thread, via PM or chat.  I really appreciate it!

<p>I&#39;m a 34F, TTC &gt;1yr, DOR, IUI x6 (3 Clomid, 3 Menopur), no MFI.  Scheduled for IVF in Feb 2019. We&#39;ve been having issues with our current clinic (posted it on Friday AM chat)... scheduling issues, our original RE left, and then communication/administrative issues with the IVF team.  Unless some other big issue arises we will continue with them for our first IVF cycle (will lose $500 of our deposit if we choose to cancel). We&#39;re 100% out-of-pocket for IVF.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a glass-half empty, extreme worrier and like to have a back-up plan...and a back-up back-up plan.  I&#39;ve been researching other clinics in the bay area in the event that IVF #1 goes horribly and wanted to reach out to you guys to see if you have had any positive or negative experiences with any bay area clinics.  I saw a few older posts (most recent was a year ago) about this topic but wanted to see how people feel now.</p>

<p>What clinic are you at and do you like the care you&#39;ve received so far?  Is there a clinic you left and what made you leave? Were CDC and SART success rates a factor in your decision?  I noticed that some clinics didn&#39;t report stats to CDC or SART. Do you find this alarming? (No shade to Dr. Aimee since I heard she is AMAZING despite not seeing any data reported). </p>

105,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,

I've been sort of lurking on here occasionally but after this week, I think it's time to do an intro. My husband and I are both 37 and we've been struggling with pregnancy loss and unexplained infertility since 2013. (I used to be on TFAB and TTCAfterLoss eons ago.) This is gonna sound desperate, but I'm so lost and I'm hoping someone here has been in my shoes and can offer advice. I'm sorry for how long this is; I lack brevity. OK, here goes:

On Tuesday, we had to terminate our first successful IVF pregnancy with a PGS tested embryo at 6w. After a week of odd and increasingly alarming symptoms, an ultrasound revealed that, while there was indeed something in my uterus, it was a gigantic blood clot and not a baby. It was the biggest blood clot my RE has ever seen. There was so much blood in my uterus that it was leaking into my abdomen. Our RE feared an ectopic since my hormone levels were high and rising and indicative of a healthy pregnancy \*somewhere in my body\*. This is called a ""pregnancy of unknown location"", a phrase which sent literally hundreds of pithy, dark jokes tumbling through my brain, though I opted not to share any of these with the medical professionals. So, yeah, my day began at a high tech private ultrasound clinic and ended at the ER with emergency d&c and no further evidence of an ectopic. So, just another baffling miscarriage with no explanation in sight.

Wait, “another""?

Yeah see, the thing is: We lost our first pregnancy three and a half years ago to a missed miscarriage discovered at our 12 week ultrasound. Everyone - including doctors - told us not to worry after that loss; we were young (!), in perfect health (!) and we were assured we'd have success again quickly and easily. The phrases, “You’re more fertile after a miscarriage” and ""Well, you got pregnant once"" were used by more than one medical professional and countless well-meaning friends. Well, it turns out those are kind of old wives tales and proved super duper not true for us. Fast forward to 2018, after years of unsuccessful timed intercourse (so... much... fucking... timed intercourse), perfect test results for both me and my husband, a nightmarish HSG that showed maaaaaaybe blocked tubes (disproven this week since the blood was leaking into my abdominal cavity \*through my right tube\*), 4 rounds of letrazole + TI, and 3 rounds of IUI + trigger shot , we finally decided to bite the bullet and do IVF + PGS. And it worked the first round! We were thrilled and so cautiously optimistic.

Obviously not anymore.

So here I sit, wondering how to process and move on from this one. We love our RE and she's science-minded AF, but her explanation for all of this is ""extraordinarily bad luck"" and that doesn't sit well with me. She sees nothing - literally NOTHING - in any of my tests that would explain what just happened. We only have one more embryo, I'm an ancient crone in fertility years, and I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT JUST HAPPENED AND WHY. Has anyone been here? What did you do differently in your next transfer? I'd be so appreciative of any advice or suggestions from this group. Thanks, all <3

107,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello,

My husband and I are going in this week for a follow-up appt with our RE to discuss next steps after our first IVF cycle, and I am hoping to get advice on how to approach the appt (questions to ask, tests to request, etc).

**Medical Background**

* 31F, 27M, trying to conceive since Dec 2017
* Severe MFI-- 1st semen analysis found 1 million count, 1% morphology, 20% motility, 2nd analysis similar #s. We were told to go straight to IVF w/ ICSI.
* No known female factors. HSG & SIS were normal. AMH of 4.0, hormone levels fine, ovulate regularly.

**IVF Cycle #1 Results**

* Stims for 9 days. 18 eggs, 14 mature, 7 fertilized with ICSI.
* @ day 3 all 7 still going (1-nine cell, 2- seven cell, 2- six cell, 1- five cell, 1-two cell (we were not told about quality)
* Transferred 2 best embryos on day 3. Negative beta. One embryo made it to freeze at day 5. Graded as a 3/2BB. We did not do PGS testing b/c of my age and the limited number of embryos.

**Financial/Insurance Considerations**

* We have amazing insurance right now. 4 lifetime cycles left under current insurance (with FET counting as a cycle) and excellent coverage for testing and treatments. I am leaving my job on June 30, 2019 and will lose this insurance. It is unclear what our coverage will be like moving forward (this is one of the reasons we went to an RE so early).
* We most likely will have to transfer the frozen embryo before we can have another egg retrieval covered, but I am confirming with my company's HR reps once the open enrollment madness is over.

We want to take advantage of our current insurance as much as possible before June 30 so want to move quickly with next steps. However, I know that any future fertility benefits we have might look back to the cycles we do now for determining lifetime benefits so I do not want to ""waste"" cycles by rushing into them without doing appropriate testing/taking measures to improve my husband's sperm quality that could improve our results.  I know that it typically takes at least 3 months to see sperm quality improvements following treatments.

&#x200B;

What questions should we be asking at this appt?  My RE initially did not want to take any measures to improve my husband's sperm quality because he said even with improved quality we would need IVF w/ ICSI. Should we request a urologist referral? My husband was not tested for DNA fragmentation so I plan to ask about that.  Are there any other tests we should be asking about? Or other measures to address male factor issues?

&#x200B;

Any advice or input is appreciated! I have read through the MFI subreddit and found it very helpful. Thanks!

So her doctor finally got around to diagnosing her with it and ""infertility"" after she pressed him for it.

Her periods have actually returned twice, very irregular, but she's still not conceiving, she's basically having to ask her doctor to do tests, something I feel he should be managing her care, instead of her having to ask for stuff. Now she tells me he is talking about clomid!

So I call to make the appointments and figure I will check in about the insurance. They say he doesn’t do these types of appointments.... fucking hell. He will “get back to me”. I call a recommended dr from UCLA- “we don’t do remote monitoring”.  Fuck you all. People move and leave their embryos in other places! (Ok- not me exactly but still!) so- who has a fucking awesome gyno for me? Who will do my stuff? The internet is useless. Are any of YOU gynos or have LA connections? Also, hi! I spend most of my time in senior class but used to be in here back when I was trying with my own eggs at 32. Low AMH is a bitch. </p>

It seems that we have had another big turnover of users here in r/infertility. We are always glad to see members graduate, and to welcome new users in to the fold. However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.

If you haven't already, please read our sidebar and/or the sticky post listing our rules. If you're on mobile you can find this under ""About of Community"" at the top of the page.

**Mention of pregnancy/ positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread.** Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C"". **Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules.** This is to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Sometimes mentions of children/pregnancy is painful. **Unsolicited mentions does include flair** - a reminder to keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

**Secondary infertility and those with prior success are allowed to participate here**.  Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions.  *Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success.* It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success.  Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed at the moderator's discretion.

**Set up flair which includes information on your age, diagnosis, treatment status, and current status.** This information is very helpful for our members when responding to questions. [Info on how to set up flair here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/74p8da/suggestions_for_new_members_flair_and_post_titles/)

**Use specific titles for your posts** to make them more easily searched by users. ""IVF?"" is not super helpful.  ""MFI and Endo, First round of IVF - Should we do ICSI?"" is helpful and easily searched. 

**Use the dailies!**  There are AM & PM threads posted by the automod.

* The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to Active treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won't stop asking about when you're having kids? Funny story? **Rant?** These all go in the Chat thread. We encourage off-topic stand alone posts for getting to know each other such as sharing pet pictures, talking about hobbies, and book club posts.

* The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.

* Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. Questions phrased like ""has anyone else tried clomid?!"" are not generally well received. There are over 10,000 subscribers here with the majority having gone through several different courses of treatment.

**Be kind to one another.** There is no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.

**This is a science-minded, realistic, sometimes cynical sub.** There are many communities online for people who want a more ""positive"" or ""upbeat"" experience complete with baby du$t and those who are seeking ways to ""cure"" infertility with natural remedies, gimmicks or diet cleanses have many places to go. People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).

**Sex, embryos, and sperm.** These are the correct terms. Infertility isn't cute, and neither are the terms we use.  There has been an increase in automod triggers for banned terms/acronyms. Our sub prefers that [these acronyms/terms](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7t7092/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms_terms/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=infertility&utm_content=t5_2saej) are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.  AF means ""As Fuck"" and the use of AF for referring to a period is not allowed.

**No solicitations will be allowed for monetary or medication donations.** To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed. *Posts by members who want to donate their leftover meds to others here are allowed.*

**If you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button.** The ""report"" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment.

Some quick(ish) background - I was diagnosed with an endometrioma almost 10 years ago during an ultrasound. My periods have always been somewhat crampy with some stomach-related symptoms, but nothing debilitating. I always sensed I would have trouble getting pregnant and went to the RE right at 6 months of trying. We had two failed IUIs and then turned to IVF. My AMH and all other tests (+ husband's SA) are normal for my age, except some time in the past several years I developed another endometrioma (cute - now my ovaries are twins) - I have no idea if I have endometriosis elsewhere, but I'm officially diagnosed at Stage 3-4 endo due to the endometriomas. My retrievals went well - we got 2 PGS normals in round one and 11 fertilized from round 2 (retrieval was yesterday), which we largely did for banking purposes, as we'd like to have at least 2 children.

Which leads me to my question -- thanks to this sub and other research, I asked my doctor about going straight to Depot Lupron before my FET. She did some research and said it can't hurt and can only help, and recommended 2 month-long shots before going straight into a FET. I'm now feeling torn for a few reasons - side effects, particularly long-term bone density loss, the feeling that I'm going to Plan B before Plan A (i.e. - if going big for the first transfer doesn't work, then what do we do?), and the cost if this doesn't work (only 3 total lifetime Lupron shots are covered by my insurance, then it's $1,500!). I'm supposed to do the first shot next week, but would be willing to wait a month to see how many embryos we get from this round and making a decision based on that. But, if this will increase my chances, I'm willing to do it.

My wife and I have been their patients since early 2015. For our very first appointment at the clinic, we drove seven hours to Ottawa and the receptionist told us that our appointment has been rescheduled and we received a message. No, we didnt receive a message. It should have been a major red flag that they cancelled our very first appointment and didnt even tell us. I complained until they agreed to have a different doctor talk to us...

We learned quickly that I have terrible sperm, and I was referred to a urologist at the clinic who specializes in male fertility. He said that because I have some sperm to work with, there is no point in having me go through treatments and they will just do IVF with what I have.

We have now done two full rounds of IVF with the clinic and were supposed to begin our third this week. We have had ONE embryo transfer in over three years. Our first cycle we got seven eggs and only one turned in to a high quality Day 5. The clinic doesnt allow embryos to develop past Day 5. We did a fresh transfer and it failed.

On our second cycle they overstimulated my wife. We got nearly forty eggs but only two developed in the high quality embryos (allegedly due to the overstimulation). We had wanted to do a fresh transfer for both embryos, but they couldnt because of the overstimulation. So they charged us thousands of dollars to freeze the eggs.

For the FET, my wife had to take vagina pills and I had to give her injections in her butt every day, and twice a day every third day. The lab gave us the wrong amount of medication TWO TIMES and I had to take a day off work and drive seven hours each time to PAY for more. Then after weeks of injections we finally traveled to Ottawa and stayed in a hotel for our FET appointment, only to get a call in the morning telling us that both of our Grade A embryos died while being thawed. During our follow-up appointment, the doctor said that each of our embryos had a 95% chance to survive being thawed, so theres about a one in four hundred chance that both would die.

The clinic refused to refund any money, which they forced us to pay because of their error, for the FET which we never received.

Now we are trying our THIRD IVF cycle with them because we dont have any other reasonable options. We were supposed to get started this week but the clinic doesnt answer their phones or return voice mails. We have been calling them for two weeks to get started and my wifes period started today, so now we have to wait another month to get started if they ever even call us back.

In the meantime, I have been following up with an endocrinologist for other issues Im having. It turns out I have both a vericocele and a brain tumour which are affecting my hormones. The tumour is life threatening and would have been much easier to treat if the Ottawa Fertility Clinic had bothered to investigate why my sperm sucks when I initially saw them three and a half years ago. Instead they just wanted to get tens of thousands of dollars from me and didnt care about me as a patient.

The urologist who identified my vericocele referred me to the same male fertility specialist I saw over three years ago. He said its that guys job to operate on vericoceles.

I have never had such a bad experience as a client before in any industry. Every single time I need to contact the clinic for any reason, there is a problem.

If anyone out there has the capacity to open up a competing clinic in the Ottawa area, or even in Kingston, PLEASE DO IT.

I ported this morning and you were all a massive help and encouraged me to use this subreddit for support so here I am again.

I’m 23 and my best friend is 21. She’s been with her partner for about a year. 
She has always been on birth control but tonight sent me a message saying that she’s thinking about coming off of it to start a family. I don’t think it is the right time for her, but that’s none of my business and it also isn’t my concern here.

The moment she told me that I replied politely and then totally shut down and cried. I know she will meet her beautiful baby before me and she isn’t even pregnant yet. She hasn’t even stopped using birth control, but I know she will be successful before us. We aren’t getting anywhere without IVF and aren’t due to start that until March time of next year. My own personal choice for certain reasons. That’s over 4 months for her to fall pregnant, and with my luck she most definitely will.

I sound evil here and such a bitch but this really does hurt. It gave me a mild panic attack when she told me she was thinking of trying for a baby because I can’t deal with her also falling pregnant just like everyone else around me is. It will hurt so much. 

A distant cousin of mine fell pregnant recently and it made me suicidal. To a normal woman who isn’t infertile that likely sounds extreme but I was at my lowest point. I didn’t attempt to harm myself but I had to admit defeat and go back to see a doctor to be placed in therapy and on anti depressants. Which are slowly working but tonight I feel crud. 

5 months ago my partners sister had a baby. The baby was born in the middle of the night and before we went to bed we were told his sister was in labour. I laid awake that entire night, my heart banging in my chest anticipating the moment my partners phone went off as I knew once it vibrated it meant the baby had been born. It meant that I would have to put on a brave face. I went and saw our new nephew but sadly we have only seen him two times due to our emotional issues. I’m trying to see him more however and be a better person, but it’s hard.

I don’t know how I will cope when she ends up pregnant. I’m already hurting now and she’s not even began trying yet. I just know the finish line is closer for her than it is us. Providing she doesn’t have any issues which she most likely doesn’t because most people aren’t infertile. 
This wasn’t a worry I expected to have as soon as this. She has always been like a sister to me and she said to me just 6 months ago, before I knew my tubes were blocked, that she was pretty impressed by my partner and I trying for a baby at such a young age because she couldn’t do it and wants to enjoy being young. (My partner isn’t really young, he’s 30, but still, she meant me) I never thought I’d be in this race with her. I thought I’d have done IVF by the time she fell pregnant or began trying. She’s only 21. 
I’m that hurt Over this tonight that I casually attempted to lie and claim that my partner and I were no longer trying for a baby. When she asked me why, I lied again and said I didn’t want one anymore and wanted to get on a better financial ground. This isn’t true, obviously, I have IVF scheduled for March ‘19 but sometimes it’s easier to lie. She does not know my tubes are blocked or we are doing IVF. She knows we have been trying for a baby for over a year though.

Another one of my close friends who thankfully isn’t a threat because she’s a lesbian and dislikes babies, said to me tonight “You don’t need to feel jealous of those reaching this imaginary finishing line you have created because you will get your baby some day. It doesn’t matter if other people have theirs first.” Whilst I appreciate her support, she could never know how it feels to see those close to you have beautiful babies whilst you are stuck. The only thing getting me through tonight is the knowledge that I am blessed with a good AMH score and have been given a good estimated outcome from IVF. But Jesus this is breaking my heart. 

This friend also mentioned us potentially bringing IVF forward a few months to say January if I’m feeling as upset over my other best friend TTC. Again, I know she means well but the reason I’m holding off IVF until March is to get my head more clear. IVF is a huge emotional strain on both people in a relationship and currently I cannot take anymore emotional strain. I can see further emotional strain ending very badly for me due to my worrying thoughts over the past month.

After trying for a baby for 1.5 years it was recently discovered both of my tubes are totally blocked AND I have pcos. Everyone originally thought that the reason I wasn’t getting pregnant was due to not ovulating but most months I could confirm ovulation. 

Nobody knows why my tubes are blocked, that’ll require further testing if I care to find out. I’ve never had an infection that would cause a blockage. I’m going to assume endometriosis even though I’ve never had heavy or painful periods. Or maybe it’s simply just by chance. Who knows at this stage.

Of course the only way forward is IVF. I’m in the U.K. and unsure of how it works in America but luckily we have fairly good 100% refund programmes for under 30s needing IVF. There is also the option to freeze any embryos made and have them put in at a later date if we wanted a second child and third. 

I’m just so angry. I can’t even think straight. Haven’t been able to since I got diagnosed. I am freaking 23 years old and 100% destined to go down the IVF path. I also read online it’s incredibly rare to have pcos and endometriosis together. Lucky me.

We will probably only ever have 2 children, that’s if IVF doesn’t fail us - I’m just being optimistic.

235,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'll preface this with, excuse the typos and what not, I'm on mobile and still incredibly frustrated. 

So today my husband and I had an appointment with our fertility specialist to discuss our options. Up until now, we have done 4 rounds of clomid, 3 or 4 of letrozole, and 3 or 4 rounds of letrozole woth shots and IUI. Nothing. I have been pregnant in the past (an oops with an ex boyfriend years ago). That pregnancy led to a miscarriage and a D&C. My husband and I been trying for about 2 years now. While discussing our options, we brought up possibly using donor sperm. His semen has been analyzed twice, and it came back with a good count, however he has decreased movement and that aren't all shaped exactly how they should be. Our doctor told us that this is nothing that he has never seen before and he has seen success with those in far worse circumstances. However, nothing thus far has worked, and we're essentially being told that IVF is our only option. IVF is just too expensive, we can't make it happen right now. So today we wanted to discuss possibly using donor sperm. This was a decision that we came to together, under the assumption that he was the ""problem"" out of the two of us. However, when we brought this up, our doctor told us that it wouldnt increase our chances at all. He then suggested a laporoscopy (essentially an exploratory surgery) to see if there are any issues with my pelvis, but then went straight back to ""IVF completely bypasses the pelvis anyways"". 


The main point there is that we have been under the assumption and led to believe that his sperm is the issue. So how can donor sperm not fix that? How is exploratory surgery in any way helpful, and it can possibly be all for nothing if they find nothing? Also it can cause further harm, even if nothing was wrong to begin with. 


I feel like we're being funnelled into believing that IVF is our only option, and at 18k we just can't afford it. My doctor has everything to gain from us spending that money. Am i wrong in thinking that? I just can't see how donor sperm won't help. He also gave no reason as to why it isn't a viable option.

<p>So today my husband and I had an appointment with our fertility specialist to discuss our options. Up until now, we have done 4 rounds of clomid, 3 or 4 of letrozole, and 3 or 4 rounds of letrozole woth shots and IUI. Nothing. I have been pregnant in the past (an oops with an ex boyfriend years ago). That pregnancy led to a miscarriage and a D&amp;C. My husband and I been trying for about 2 years now. While discussing our options, we brought up possibly using donor sperm. His semen has been analyzed twice, and it came back with a good count, however he has decreased movement and that aren&#39;t all shaped exactly how they should be. Our doctor told us that this is nothing that he has never seen before and he has seen success with those in far worse circumstances. However, nothing thus far has worked, and we&#39;re essentially being told that IVF is our only option. IVF is just too expensive, we can&#39;t make it happen right now. So today we wanted to discuss possibly using donor sperm. This was a decision that we came to together, under the assumption that he was the &quot;problem&quot; out of the two of us. However, when we brought this up, our doctor told us that it wouldnt increase our chances at all. He then suggested a laporoscopy (essentially an exploratory surgery) to see if there are any issues with my pelvis, but then went straight back to &quot;IVF completely bypasses the pelvis anyways&quot;. </p>

<p>The main point there is that we have been under the assumption and led to believe that his sperm is the issue. So how can donor sperm not fix that? How is exploratory surgery in any way helpful, and it can possibly be all for nothing if they find nothing? Also it can cause further harm, even if nothing was wrong to begin with. </p>

<p>I feel like we&#39;re being funnelled into believing that IVF is our only option, and at 18k we just can&#39;t afford it. My doctor has everything to gain from us spending that money. Am i wrong in thinking that? I just can&#39;t see how donor sperm won&#39;t help. He also gave no reason as to why it isn&#39;t a viable option. He gave no medical issue with me, but suggested an exploratory surgery that MIGHT come up with something that&#39;s wrong with me. </p>

<p>We&#39;re just so lost and so frustrated. We thought that we had a good handle on the issue, and then today found that we have no idea whats going on and neither does my doctor. I honestly just want to pull my hair out right now..</p>

First post...feeling very compelled to post my feels! 

My husband and I are 33, we’ve been trying for 18 months and have been told we have unexplained infertility...we’re currently at a crossroads at going down the IVF journey but also holding out a slither of hope for the next few months that maybe just maybe we might get lucky...

I’ve been pretty level about this journey until a few months ago where I’ve all of a sudden developed this hypersensitivity to everything pregnancy and baby related...as most of you will know its soo isolating especially when your friends are all currently pregnant or have babies, its hard to know where to turn for a good solid chat with like minded people when most around me have had a somewhat easy ride when falling pregnant. 

Obviously I’m not about to keep my life on hold as I know a year from now if we still haven’t got there in this journey I would of wished I would of made a career move earlier, so I applied for a role I’ve been wanting experience in, I had the first interview and met the GM, all went well I felt good about our understanding about me not having a whole lot of the experience in the role but I came across like this is very much my next progression in my career, got along well with the GM, awesome. Today I had a second interview and met the Director, straight away my intuition kicked in telling me this guy is super arrogant, poker face with little to no personality, if that didn’t put me off then the first question within the first few minutes of meeting him was if I had kids and if I was looking to have kids... I was taken back by the question and I did say, well yes I want kids in the future.... what the hell else was I supposed to say after being put on the spot like that?! 
I left feeling it was an unprofessional question to ask, I felt that the question was asked to make a pivotal decision about my stance and whether I would be pregnant 6 months down the track. 
I don’t know whether my feelings about this question are way more heightened because of my fertility situation or whether this is in fact a truly tacky question?! 

Yes, I’m trying to have a baby but this whole journey is soo uncertain...it may take me years so am I just meant to lull about in a role I’m dissatisfied?

We've run 2 IVF cycles this year... The first with 9 eggs, the second with 11... We tested 5 total embryos, all with chromosomal abnormalities.  I'm about to start a third cycle, but I'm feeling like my eggs aren't as comfortable with my age as I am, so we should probably have a Plan B.

I have a sister who is 12 years younger than me.  If this next round doesn't net healthy embryos for me, I'm thinking using my sister's donor eggs is the next best thing.  It makes me sad (not my DNA, wtf) and happy (lucky I have a sister with young eggs, and super lucky she might be willing to go through this for me) at the same time.  It's a lot to wrap my head around (like, ""Will it feel like my child?""), and a lot for her to wrap her head around potentially as well (like, ""Will it feel like my child?"").

I figured it would be useful to graphically display what a cycle looks like in terms of time commitment. I didn't really find any good versions. 


I figured, I could make different ones for different circumstances: freezing eggs, freezing embryos, FET, Fresh transfer, IUI, FET with donor egg or sperm, Surrogacy, etc. Basically, have a graphical model of what to expect in each person's circumstances.

https://imgur.com/a/AnkRkZn here is what i've come up with so far.

These are SUPER basic and do not get into how much investment - time, money, emotion, pain - goes into a cycle.  I'm totally aware of that, and I don't think there is a way to give that understanding in what I'm looking to do. 

I want people who are TTC and who are starting to consider their options who, unlike much of this community, are thus far uninitiated and likely overwhelmed with information that is often hard to digest.

So besides critiquing what I've made, what would have been helpful for you to see when you first started down this path?

NB: I know the duration of things aren't right or consistent. I'm just playing around with it. Once I have my wife's standard protocols, I'll make ones that are more accurate.

After the HyCosy if nothing is found then they will be looking towards other potential issues and other treatments which may involve IUI and IVF. (IUI is looking likely at this stage anyhow)

I've had numerous ultrasounds in which my uterus and parts have been described as 'normal' and 'nothing to comment on' but I'm terrified that I'll end up needing a surrogate. The reason I'm as worried is because in the UK where I live we are not protected by any laws. For example, even if the child is genetically yours and your husbands you are not protected if the surrogate wants to keep that baby.

&#x200B;

So my question is - is surrogacy a pretty common outcome for infertility issues? I know it sounds like such an odd question but I saw a show on the TV earlier today about a surrogate keeping the baby in my country and it just had me thinking oh my god what if surrogacy was our only option.

What are the reasons for a woman needing a surrogate mother? I've heard it is usually because they don't have a uterus or cannot safely carry a baby, but I don't know a lot about it.

&#x200B;

Thanks.

These are the options the doctor mentioned:

1. Do another round of IVF, this time with PGS testing. He thinks I could have egg quality issues due to low number of blasts.  This will cost around 6-8k due to testing and freezing. Thankfully, insurance covers IVF.

2. Do another transfer although our odds go down. Possibly transfer both remaining embryos. 

3. ERA test, although he doesn’t suggest that after only one failed transfer.

We did our first round of freeze all IVF in July. I had a septate uterus and had two hysteroscopies to correct it prior to transfer.

277,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'm conflicted.

When we first started our IF journey, my semen analysis(es?) were normal, though morphology and forward progression were on the lower end of the spectrum.   We still had good fertilization rates during IVF, and concentrated on my wife to find reasons for repeated implantation failure.  Having finally identified some likely issues with timing and silent endo, we are in need of creating some more viable embryos again, and started looking into MFI to increase our chances.

We promptly did another semen analysis, as well as a SCSA DNA fragmentation test.  The DNA frag test came back low at 2% (great!) but the SA showed low morphology and borderline forward progression.  The full results were  4.2ml, 63M/ml, 73% Motile, 2% Morph, 2 Forward Progression.  Additionally, sperm prep numbers show concentrations between 60M and 100M per ML and back up the 2 rating for forward progression.  Our doctors were not phased at all, and said 2% of \~250M sperm is still plenty.  They did not suggest ICSI, preferring to let Darwin do his thing.  This was confirmed between three doctors at our current clinic, as well as a fourth doctor at a different clinic.

I decided to go see a reproductive urologist for piece of mind, and as I had feared, he found a bilateral grade 2 varicocele.  Still he did not think surgery was warranted, nor prudent considering advanced maternal age, and the fact that we are already doing IVF.  The risks and delays outweigh the potential upside according to him.

So is that it?  Why cant I shake the feeling that there are other factors, perhaps unknown or unidentifiable factors that are negatively affecting our embryos?   Is it as simple as good DNA + good fertilization rate = good enough?  Am I just searching for problems until I find one?

The reason this comes to a head today is because we had our sixth retrieval yesterday and had the fewest number of fertilized eggs yet.  I know age is a major factor, and I also suspect possible over-maturation of the eggs since they decided to push the trigger back to get an extra day of stims in, and lead follicles were 24mm, and had been over 20mm for three days.  Anyway, I cant help but think that another retrieval is in our future, and I dont want to be a few months down the road wishing I had done the varicocele surgery.

Our Standard IVF (non ICSI) fertilization rates for all six cycles have been:  69%, 65%, 88%, 100%, 92%, 70%.   Whats more, the few studies I could find regarding IFV outcomes for morphology-only MFI suggest Standard IVF has a slight edge over ICSI in fertilization rates, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates.  

Considering the above, should I pursue additional medical opinions in an attempt to get someone to suggest the surgery?  Or should I leave ""well enough"" alone, and continue to do what I can through lifestyle changes and supplements/coq10?

 I don’t even know where to begin. Please stick with me.

My sister had a baby in 2013, Sarah, who I fell in love with SO HARD. I have been an aunt for a while so I don’t know what happened, but Sarah was my heart. I spent any free time visiting her cause I just loved to watch her.... be alive. After a year of this and my family calling me creepy for loving her too much, we decided that my husband and I should start trying for our own. I wanted to be able to love someone to the fullest without people thinking it was weird. So, we started trying the beginning of 2014. 

Flash forward a few years, we were having infertility problems. I get surgery and find out I have endometriosis because of some pain (from hell) that I’ve dealt with for years but didn’t know the cause. The infertility continued, we tested my husband with good results and did artificial insemination several times to no avail as well as fertility medications. I tried to not let my infertility consume me.

February 2017 my life fell apart when we found out my sister’s husband, son and daughter (Sarah) died in a plane crash. I loved her husband and son SO MUCH too, but I don’t even know how to grieve three such important people in my life, even now. So far I can only work on grieving Sarah.

My heart broke that day and my hope in anything died with them. I wanted to kill myself last year, but know my family couldn’t cope with any more loss. My sister was pregnant at the time and has since had her baby girl who has become my life- I truly live for her. 

I have six siblings, and the two younger than me both had or are having babies this year. My younger sister didn’t want to get pregnant but accidentally did and had the smoothest pregnancy with a perfect baby boy. They live in our basement to save money, and I hate that the first baby to live in our home isn’t mine. I hate that I feel this way too.

The past year and a half since the accident- I’ve tried to figure out my new normal. I’ve tried to help my sister and her new baby and with all of the loss. I’ve tried to help my younger sister with her baby. I teach high school and care so much about my students. I volunteer in a grief group for kids that are so sweet and matter so much to me.

Last night I had a dream that my sisters new baby died. I woke up devastated. I realized that I can’t take one more thing. I feel like a game of Jenga that is ready to topple over.

I also realized that everything in my life (aside from my husband) that matters to me isn’t mine at all. I had no say in Sarah going on a plane because she wasn’t mine. And I have no control over the new baby’s life either. Several of my students are going through absolute hell at home and there’s nothing I can do to help. And the kids at the grief group don’t even remember my name- though I very much remember theirs.

Lately I have been getting super nauseous when I’m even the tiniest bit tired or hungry. I feel like my body is shutting down, I really do.

I decided not to kill myself last year, but that doesn’t mean I want to live. I thought living for others would be good enough because living for myself wasn’t, but I realize I am going to be crushed over and over if I put all my eggs in other people’s baskets. 

I don’t want to live in a world without Sarah. Why did I fall so deeply in love with her just to lose her? I don’t want to feel like hell physically and emotionally every day. Not only am I not getting pregnant, but the reason I’m not getting pregnant is causing me immense physical pain, and the fertility treatments have been very expensive. I don’t want to be so attached to all of these things that aren’t mine. I want to be happy. I want to have a kid of my own. I want to feel better. I want a reason to live for me. I want help. I need help. 

I’m in therapy and on medication. Without those I’d be dead, but they aren’t enough. What else can I do to survive this? Thanks for reading.

So infertility is shit. I get that. However in the last ten months of really “trying” I have changed a lot.
Back story is we started ttc feb 2017. I took out the iud and was ready to get pregnant!
Well in March I did. I did a pregnancy test and the next day I started bleeding...I knew something wasn’t right. I’ll spare the details but eventually we discovered it was ectopic and I did medical management with methotrexate. It took me until July 2017 for my beta to hit zero. In that time we cancelled a big trip to Japan, my grandmother died and we moved across Canada for my work. It was hell. Our first few months in the new province were tough. My husband struggled to adjust to a new job and my job was very demanding. I was always thinking about having a baby and trying to time things but we weren’t doing any real tracking etc. In November I went to my GP and said I wanted to see a specialist to make sure everything was ok after the ectopic. We did some bloodwork and all of it was normal. I got into the infertility clinic super fast and they did the sono and HSG. HSG was normal and on sono the doc said my afc was a little lower than normal but I could do the AMH if I wanted to really know my reserve.
Anyways not much happened until January. Husband kinda got more on board with tracking things etc. Then in March I decide to do the AMH. It came back as .96. We were panicked. Got back to the clinic and started doing some tracked cycles with femara and met about IVF.
We have had no success. Also every month my cycles seem to get progressively worse. In the meantime our best friends got pregnant, his younger brother and wife got pregnant, his best friends wife is pregnant. Several other people around us are pregnant too. Every single one of these pregnancy announcements sent me spiralling.
Fast forward to now. We tried to start IVF in September and had to stop early because of poor response to stims (max dose and hgh). 
Donor egg has come up 3 times in the last few weeks.
Since September I have kinda collapsed emotionally. Before then it was tough but I could pull it together and was coping ok. Since September I feel like someone else. I have stopped talking to my friends. My very good friend just had a 24 week old baby and I don’t talk to her. I’m sure she could use me as a friend but I have told her I just need space. She is being understanding but I feel like a terrible person. My other friend with kids keeps messaging me and I ignore her. I don’t want to talk to her or see her because she doesn’t get it and I don’t want a pity party.  I deleted Facebook because I couldn’t handle the baby pictures and pregnancy pictures. I also didn’t want anyone trying to look at my profile to snoop and see if I am pregnant or what is going on. 
This weekend we went to my in-laws house and my baby nephew was there. I love my nephew and enjoy seeing him but the last few times I have seen him I have these mixed emotions. Seeing my sister in law hold him and smile at him sets me off. I was super rude to my mother in law every time she tried to talk to me and I can’t even explain why. It’s like I am mad at her for not needing me to give her a grandchild now and I don’t want her to know how hard I am struggling because she doesn’t need to care now, she has her baby to coo and coddle and love. Meanwhile I had to sneak away at dinner to go give myself my injection for IUI this month that probably won’t even work. 
It’s messed up. 
My husband got mad at me this weekend and told me he has to walk on eggshells around me and that I am such a loving person at home but that I act like a total bitch to his family and friends. He is right. I feel like garbage. I also feel like I am so far gone that I am going to isolate him from me and lose my one support person. I am scared he will give up on me and this process. 
Long story short, I am not myself anymore. We aren’t even a full year into this process and I am falling apart. I am scared of who I am becoming and scared that my husband is done with this. I don’t know how much longer I can do this and at what price to my identity/emotional status.
I see a psychiatrist every week to talk through things but I don’t know how much it is helping. She won’t give me medication either. I am so uptight and angry all the time it is exhausting. I act like a bitch so people leave me alone because I don’t want anyone to see my suffering.

I have done EVERYTHING....I am talking multiple surgeries (Lap x2, hysteroscopy x 2), receptivity biopsies, acupuncture, reiki, supplements, homeopathy,  every diet imaginable (whole 30, gluten free, dairy free) essential oils, yoga, massage, RPL panel, immune panel, etc etc etc...and all I have to show for it after all these years is 1 ectopic and 1 loss.
