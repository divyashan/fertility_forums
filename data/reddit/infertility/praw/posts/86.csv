I've just completed my first cycle of IVF, which failed. I had two mature follicles (6 immature) and only one fair quality egg was retrieved. It fertilized but degenerated by day 3.

I have endometriosis, and have had surgery 2x on my right ovary to remove large cysts. Between the endo and the surgeries I believe I'm firmly in the DOR camp.

This is the stimulation protocol I was using:

* Days 3-7 : Gonal F 225 IU, Menopur 75 IU
* Days 8-11: Gonal F 225 IU, Menopur 75 IU, Cetrotide .25 mg
* Day 12: Cetrotide .25 mg, Lupron trigger p.m.
* Day 13: Lupron trigger a.m.
* Day 14 retrieval 

I should also add that I'm on a ton of supplements: CoQ10, prenatal, vitamin d, wheat germ oil, fish oil, DHEA, iron.

Tomorrow I have a meeting with a provider to discuss plans for a second cycle. Is anyone with DOR willing to share a stimulation protocol that has been relatively successful for them? I'm also going to cross-post this to the InfertilityBabies sub, but I wanted to ask here because we're all still in the trenches.

My sincerest thanks to anyone who can help! I've tried researching and have honestly been overwhelmed - there doesn't seem to be any consensus or any best practices regarding DOR patients. Between this and the general dumpster fire that is my life (serious elder care issues and a high stress job during a high stress time of year), I'm running out of energy for research. I've checked the FAQs, but I wasn't seeing a ton of replies from people with DOR.

I've been lurking on this board for a while, and have only recently actually decided to post a few times - perhaps because I'm realizing I'm needing more support or connection than I've been seeking out - so I figured it was time to introduce myself.

I'm 33 years old in a same-sex relationship with my wife who is also 33. She will be carrying the (hopefully) first time around. We've been trying to conceive since January of 2019. We started with IUIs, as donor sperm is -as many of you know -not cheap. We didn't want to risk at-home insemination not working and blaming ourselves for potential errors and figured IUIs would give us a higher rate of potential success. I wish we had moved on from IUIs before the 7th and final one failed, but alas, the NP we were working with seemed positive, all tests came back normal (except TSH was a bit off - but subclinical, and she began levothyroxine). 3 IUIs were medicated but no monitoring done. We gave up after number 7, said goodbye to the Kaiser team, and have moved on to a big fertility clinic in our area.

We are now in the waiting game with the egg retrieval planned for February 2020. Should it result in any embryos, we will do the pre-implantation testing, which puts us at a late March/early April FET should all go smoothly until then. Who knows! Our doc seems to have no concerns about the process.

I've just sunken a bit more into hopelessness as this has taken a toll on our relationship; has been occurring at the same time as other medical issues for my wife (4 eye surgeries this year!); as well as what seems like a common experience for a lot of folks - endless pregnancy announcements from family, friends, and co-workers (at least 8 that I can think of off the top of my head). I've been trying to find a therapist for myself (unsuccessfully due to full practices), and I've just committed to running a 10k in late spring/early summer as I've completely let go of my self care routines that keep me feeling good.

*Yes what works for one couple might not work for another but maybe we can all help each other out and newbies with what we have learned throughout our journey as we all know this is hard on marriages

My advice;
When you realize this is your journey you need to have reoccurring discussions depending on what you doing/ deciding on. 

The biggest points being in my opinion expectations of each other.  For example when we are going through ivf cycles my expectation is that my husband rolls with the mood swings the med causes and tries to come to the big appointments (retrieval and transfer). 

That being said in our marriage he is the breadwinner by far, and he can't just quit his career or piss off his boss and deal with it later (military).  So sometimes things don't work out the way we both like.  

His expectations of me are that he likes to get a rough estimate of the schedule and as I am the one who gets the schedule I loop him in on projected dates.  We keep a shared Google calendar that whenever an appointment is made (he also puts all his appointments and work commitments that he has to do, this works for us cause we both check our calendars daily) is put on there and I also let him know when new appointments are put on.  He is also obsessive about wanting me to respond to his check ins throughout the day about how I am feeling because he wants to know if I am having a rough day that turned good, decent day turned rough etc.  

This is what works for us.  We both get our needs met in a way we can both be satisfied with.  

My other biggest piece of advice for first timers is that the meds can be hard on you.  And you need to have a Frank conversation with your partner about some of the side effects of the meds.  Some people experience none some people experience all.  In my case it seems like each time I go through a cycle I add on another side effect.

Sorry for the standalone and the long text, but I didn’t want to junk up the daily with this (though I’ll move it there if Mods think I should).

My RE is recommending we repeat the same protocol for my second FET next month (bcp, lupron start, then 2x/wk estradiol valerate, adding in PIO 5 days before transfer. Add 1x daily progesterone/estrogen compounded suppositories the day after transfer. Dexamethasone and folic acid throughout). The first transfer resulted in a very low hcg (dr said it was “technically” a chemical, but not sure what she meant by that). 

I have hashimoto’s, controlled with 50mcg synthroid daily. Tsh has been between 1-2 for awhile now.

I’ve reread the wiki and searched PubMed, and have come up with maybe adding intralipids and/or doxycycline. ERA, scratch and RPL panels seem extreme at this point, but I’m willing if that’s the general consensus. 

Other info that may be relevant: non-PGS day five embryo, rated 5AA was transferred. Lining 9.4 and trilaminar 9 days before transfer. Transfer procedure was “textbook”. Retroverted uterus. We went straight to IVF, since our MFI is so extreme. 

I do realize we may have made the wrong choice by not PGS testing, but financially it was two transfers or PSG and one transfer. For better or worse, I prioritized two transfer chances.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

A bit of backstory, I'm 24, 25 in a week. I was born with a heart defect and of course I've had to put up with this all my life etc. Anyway I have a few other stuff wrong with me too like chronic pain and mental health issues. So I'm really struggling. I've been trying to have a kid about 4 years now maybe more, I lost count. I've had to talk to doctors who have discussed the risks with me about my heart and other stuff, there were always risks but I knew I wanted to do it as its all I EVER wanted. I LOVE being around babies and kids, they make me feel happy. So we have been trying, doing everything suggested and making sure I'm on safe medication for getting pregnant and other stuff like that. Anyway it hasn't happened yet, I went to see fertility and I didn't get appointments for a while and all they really did was tell me what my heart doctor told me. They did a test on my tubes and they were perfect, I had lots of follicles aswell. Still didn't manage to get pregnant and then fertility decided they weren't going to help me until I had a few more tests on my heart after waiting so long for them to help and now I had to wait longer. Fast-forward to a few months ago I got told by my heart consultant that I'm super high risk now for pregnancy. She said she really didn't think my heart could cope and she never really says anyone is too high risk but with me she thinks I won't survive. So now I'm stuck. I feel stuck in my life. I already feel stuck with my disability and now this. I just don't know how to cope with it.
People are quick to say you can do surrogacy or adopt but surrogacy costs, money I won't EVER EVER have, plus they can't collect my eggs either.
I also wouldn't be able to adopt because of my disability, my partner is my carer. So I genuinley am stuck. I've had no help, no councelling or anything. I keep thinking I'm fine, I'll be fine not having a baby, and I keep giving myself excuses but the urge for a baby is too strong! It's the only thing I have ever wanted in my life, I was born to be a mum, I gravitate towards other people's children and I even enjoy to little things like nappy changes or settling them down etc.
I don't know why I'm writing this but I just need help, like what do I do? I'm so depressed and I can feel the hurt and mental pain in my body physically and it's making my illness worse.

Ps.
Also I found out that the doctors said my painkillers were perfectly fine to be on whilst ttc and then recently another doctor has told me it effects your hormones and noone told me this when I was ttc and now it's too late to try! I just feel like I could have had a chance if they'd have told me to stop my painkillers (honestly I probably need them but I'd rather be in pain for 9 months without them than never have a baby).",t2_4okjry6y,False,,0,False,I don't know what to do..,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_eal3t3,False,dark,0.83,,public,8,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1576366605.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So I&#39;m new to this community and I didnt know where else I could put my feelings where I don&#39;t know many people.

Our diagnosis: 
HUSBAND: 
35 years old

ME: 
40 years old
DOR
AMH .2-.3
FSH 17
AFC has ranged from 4-8 since August, but has increased in number at every single ultrasound.
*I’ve been pregnant before, and they were viable when I was younger, but I chose to terminate them. 

2 months ago with timed intercourse, we got pregnant and then had an early miscarriage (chemical pregnancy) which could have been because of my egg quality and/or his chromosomal issue.

The best way to have success is obviously to do IVF, harvest eggs, test embryos and only implant healthy ones. RE said we should to create  4 normal embryos for 2 healthy kids (our family size goal)

So we set out to do IVF. First egg retrieval (started Stims on CD2) went like this:
Baseline numbers: AFC 7, AMH .2, FSH 17, estradiol 32
Stim protocol:
Gonal 300, Menopur 150, Omnitrope 

By CD3, a few hours after beginning injections, my period abruptly stopped (around 3 days early than a usual menstruation)

After 5 days of Stims, I went in for an ultrasound and blood level check: no follicles we’re growing at all from baseline, estrogen came back at <5.

Doctor concluded that I wasn’t producing eggs this month and to quit this cycle.

AFTER I STOPPED THE STIM MEDS:
- my period came back full flow the next day and lasted another 4 days. I began an ovulation Kit (the one that detects estrogen and LH) just to see what my body would do and because I literally felt my body rejected the medicine and shut down. It detected a peak in estrogen 2 days later.

So I called the dr and she had me come in exactly 7 days after stopping the Stims: AFC up to 8, 3 follicles getting pretty big with one in the lead. estradiol 32

— question is this: is it possible that I can’t take the stim protocol? She said that if I continued on the meds for many more days I could have seen this same growth I am seeing naturally now. But then why did my estradiol drop to almost nothing while on Stims as well as my period stopping fully? I felt a “shutdown” of my reproductive body while on the meds.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I’m not sure what to do....is it possible that i simply can’t do Stims and that I’ll need to “natural cycle IVF” each month and test one egg at a time? That will take us forever to get enough normal eggs/embryos etc. 

Please give me some feedback if you’ve ever seen something like this and what could have possibly worked?

We've consulted with the place that's been doing our treatment thus far and have another one scheduled next week (let's call it Clinic 2). Then we have a consultation scheduled at a third place (Clinic 3) at the end of January. I want to cancel with Clinic 3 and just pick between the current clinic and Clinic 2 (which has the best success rates according to data available). Mr. EK thinks it would be silly to not vet all our options just to not have to wait another month. He's also concerned at about the mixed google reviews at Clinic 2. 

While there's no real show stoppers with my current clinic (and I would happily go with them if they were the only option), there's a lot of little things. For example, they didn't have exact success rates for each stage of embryo development and seemed slightly annoyed by the question. They have no back-up embryologist. The doctor is also very old school and hasn't been receptive to new research I've tried to bring him. He didn't bring up the possibility of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in the consult until I said something. Stuff like that. 

The clinic we'll see next week is a research hospital with multiple doctors and I'm scheduled to see a (much prefered) woman doctor, so I'm excited to get a read there.

My name is Shayda. I’m 26, and my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for a year now. There’s a chance I have PCOS, but I’ve been told that by one doctor, yet another doctor said my tests are normal and she doesn’t think I have PCOS. I had a unilateral oophorectomy (I had my left ovary removed) due to an ovarian teratoma (I had a tissue tumor on my ovary). 

The worst part about it is I have so many friends and family members getting pregnant, and I have people tell me I need to hurry up and have children. People tell me to be patient, and not stress about it. People tell me it’ll happen when it’s meant to, or God will allow it to happen when He says we are ready. 

To be honest, it makes me want to punch every single one of those folks when they say any of that or my friends/family that tell me to hurry up, or my friends/family that get pregnant by accident or when they weren’t trying to. 

I just want to start this new part of our life with my husband. We’ve been married for 5 and a half years, and it’s time. 

If anyone has any tips or recommendations (besides to wait patiently, or to let it happen when it happens) feel free to share. I’d also love to know how you cope with this situation, since we all know how difficult and how frustrating emotionally it is.

I found myself searching many of the Facebook and other community groups for Translocation specific support, but most of the groups have a BabyCenter culture that makes me feel rather jaded.

The sub isn’t meant to take away from this wonderful place, but rather be a space where peers can share specific studies and experiences that can be rather unique to those dealing with a translocation.

For those dealing with a translocation, spontaneous conception (SC) is an incredibly traumatic and stressful event, as many pregnancies end up in loss. Our sub will be a place where, while moderated, SC can be discussed.

Rules for those interested. If you meet the following guidelines, please message the mods to request entry:

* Must have a medical diagnosis of a chromosomal rearrangement that causes infertility/RPL (translocations/etc), either for themself or partner

* Must have a history as an actively contributing member within the cohort of infertility and TTC subs

* Within the cohort of infertility and TTC subs, members must have a community minded and responsible commenting history

* No cutesy terms here. We are a science minded sub. Bodies aren’t embarrassing (other than farting in an open office workplace).

* Don’t be an asshole. Have compassion for your fellow human beings.

* Spontaneous conception and miscarriages are a complex situation due to translocations. We ask that all pregnancy discussions be posted with a trigger warning (TW) and an appropriate tag:

Spontaneous Conception (SC)

Miscarriage (MC)

Partner and I are 31, with no other medical issues except for my severe (stage 4) endometriosis. 

*First FET*: PGS normal Grade 1 blast that ended with a 6 week blighted ovum. Semi medicated transfer protocol where I used letrozole, trigger for ovulation and progesterone supplementation. 

*Second FET*: PGS normal Grade 1 blast that ended with a CP. Same semi-medicated transfer protocol as last time

My RE thinks that the ERA isn't conclusively successful as a diagnostic tool yet, and is ok with trying it if I am. She's definitely not pushing for it. She also thinks the research behind using Lupron for a couple of months to suppress the endo isn't very convincing but again, is ok with trying it if I am. 

We have 3 more PGS normal embryos to try and I'd love to get started on the next transfer asap. 

**My question is this**:
If you had a few more PGS normal embryos, would you skip the ERA for now and try a medicated cycle with 2 months of Lupron first to suppress endo? Or are you convinced that the ERA is worth it before any transfers? I guess I'm looking for clarity on whether my focus should be on endo or progesterone exposure. 

I know that most people (80%?) have an ERA result that tells them they don't need an adjustment, and the thought of ""wasting"" a few months just to end up at the beginning of another long transfer journey (with no new info) is so unappealing. 

Thank you so much for reading, and for any assistance!

July 2020 update: For anyone who finds this in the future, I chose to do a medicated transfer with my 3rd PGS normal embryo instead of the ERA and that failed as well. In hindsight, I wish I had done the ERA first but I was so impatient and thought a change in transfer protocol would do the trick.

I've been actively trying for 3 years and off birth control for 5.
I had a laproscopy in January, along with an endometrial biopsy. The biopsy was normal but I had a bit of endometriosis.

In February I got pregnant, but lost it just past 9 weeks. I had to wait a week for my d&c, and then took misoprostol. Four days after the d&c I had severe pain and went to the hospital. It ended up being a major infection. I took 10 days of heavy antibiotics and it seemed to clear up.

Since April, I have had so much spotting. Nearly every day. My doctor gave me another endometrial biopsy today, just in case there's still inflammation or an infection.

So really what I'm asking is, is it worth trying this month with the biopsy today?

cw: mention of other people's children

I'm really struggling with close friends of ours who don't seem to understand what we are going through. They are our \*only\* friends who live in the same town as us (though we're lucky to have a great support system - it is just really spread out). We are the kind of friends who (until recently) were always in each other's homes. We ate meals together, my spouse and I regularly watched their kids, we supported each other and ""got"" each other. I consider them our chosen family. 

Well, recently one of them took a new job out of state. She moved last week and he is staying here with the kids until the end of the school year. I \*get\* that this arrangement is really hard - to live apart for 6 months. We've tried to be sure they know we are around and willing to help with the kids any way we can. But it is also a good thing for them! Like, they are really excited about this move. So I'm not feeling too sorry. 

On the other hand, we've been really open about infertility, my depression, and just how deeply deeply sad we are - especially going into the holidays. And now our only near friends are leaving and we don't even have the idea of baby to distract us. 

Every time we bring up infertility (because it is a big part of our life now!) they get uncomfortable and change the subject. And yet, it feels like whenever we are together we spend 80% of the time talking about their move and her new exciting job and everything that is up in the air for them. I \*KNOW\* they are going through major transitions right now and I'm trying so hard to cut them some slack. ***But it is just one more reminder that their lives are moving on while we're stuck here waiting for a future that might never happen.*** I expected so much more from them and am just really disappointed. And even more sad.

I have friends. I have family. I have an incredibly supportive husband. But there is this fog of loneliness that hangs over me that I can't seem to shake. This feeling that we are meant to have somebody else in this life with us and that somehow we've been forgotten about. I was cooking the other night, chopping vegetables and my husband commented that I have nice ""mom hands"". I feel like these hands are supposed to be wiping little faces and buckling little people into their seatbelts. We go on drives around the neighborhood or to the local bakery and I feel like we are missing a third part of us. I find myself looking into the backseat when we drive and envisioning this toddler in boots and a hat, casually kicking their feet and looking out the window. I imagine this child everywhere. We've been together 15 years, married for nearly 10. The natural progression to have children should have happened years ago and I feel stunted.

I'm trying to take this time to work on my health, our finances, some health issues with our pets. I love this time of year so much but the shorter, darker days don't help my sadness and just contribute to this general feeling that life is passing me by. I don't think we are even bothering trying to drag out the Christmas decor. For the first time ever, I just want the holidays to be done with so we can start fresh with 2020. I feel heavy, bogged down. I feel so much older than I am.

I’m 40, DOR, low AMH, high FSH. In previous ultrasounds my Antral Follicle Counts have been 4, then 5 then this cycle was 7. So we started stims. I’ve completed 4 days of shots so far of Menopur 150mg, Gonal, and Omnitrope (HGH). This morning’s ultrasound showed that my follicles aren’t growing this month. She’s checking my estrogen to see if it’s at all rising but in the meantime has given me the heads up that if I continue these shots for another 3 days and she doesn’t see any additional follicle size growth, she’ll cancel this cycle. 

She said reasons for my body’s response this month could be because my FSH is already high so maybe I’m resistant to the hormones and it’ll take a little longer to get it to kick in OR because I have no eggs in the follicles this month. She said she’s not calling it quits yet but there’s that chance.

Yay.

I know I still ovulate and produce eggs because just 2 months ago through timed intercourse, we got pregnant and immediately had a chemical pregnancy. So something happens down there... husband has balanced translocation so we’re dual factor patients.

Infertility is complicated, as we all know. The emotions that come along with it are a minefield. The Mod Squad does our best with the Results Thread. This thread exists to create a clearly defined space where we can come together to celebrate others very early success and hold up those who are struggling with less than clear results. We all know that a positive test does not equal a take home baby. In the Results Thread, we have members whose results are not as clear cut as others. It can be incredibly difficult for those members to see updates of on-going success. As such, we have decided to implement clearer guidelines as to what is appropriate in the Results Thread. We know that /r/infertility feels like home to many of our graduating members. However, we are not a pregnancy sub and we need to protect those in the trenches. This change is effective with next week’s thread. *Please note that this change is not in response to any one graduating member’s posts but a response to the general change in the posts we are seeing in the Results Thread.* Without further ado, the new guidelines for the Results Thread.

.


**READ THIS BEFORE POSTING** Comments that do not follow these guidelines will be removed.


*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*


Posts that are appropriate for this thread:


* Positive HPT and beta results


* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.


* ~~For pregnancies that have been measuring on track and continue to do so, a pregnancy sub (such as /r/infertilitybabies) is the best place to find support and share positive ultrasound details, such as gestational size or heart rate that are completely normal and on track. Posts here should not include those details unless the findings are questionable and the poster is looking for support.~~


* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.


* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.


Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:


* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.


* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).


* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).


* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*


* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.


*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Infertility includes: primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.


For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

This thread exists to create a clearly defined space where we can come together to celebrate others very early success and hold up those who are struggling with less than clear results. We all know that a positive test does not equal a take home baby. In the Results Thread, we have members whose results are not as clear cut as others. It can be incredibly difficult for those members to see updates of on-going success. As such, we have decided to implement clearer guidelines as to what is appropriate in the Results Thread. We know that <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a> feels like home to many of our graduating members. However, we are not a pregnancy sub and we need to protect those in the trenches. This change is effective with next week’s thread. <em>Please note that this change is not in response to any one graduating member’s posts but a response to the general change in the posts we are seeing in the Results Thread.</em> Without further ado, the new guidelines for the Results Thread.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>READ THIS BEFORE POSTING</strong> Comments that do not follow these guidelines will be removed.</p>

<p><em>For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.</em></p>

<p>Posts that are appropriate for this thread:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Positive HPT and beta results</p></li>
<li><p>Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.</p></li>
<li><p><del>For pregnancies that have been measuring on track and continue to do so, a pregnancy sub (such as <a href=""/r/infertilitybabies"">/r/infertilitybabies</a>) is the best place to find support and share positive ultrasound details, such as gestational size or heart rate that are completely normal and on track. Posts here should not include those details unless the findings are questionable and the poster is looking for support.</del></p></li>
<li><p>Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as <a href=""/r/infertilitybabies"">/r/infertilitybabies</a>. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.</p></li>
<li><p>Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Links to pictures of HPTs (use <a href=""/r/TFABlineporn"">/r/TFABlineporn</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. <em>Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.</em> This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Infertility includes: primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.</p>

Apologies for long post ahead— 

Have stalked this community for a little while - since I found out I have endo around 5 months ago. 

Basically, I’m 23 and have (at least) stage 3 endo. Small left endometrioma (13mm) that my excision specialist is wanting to remove during my surgery this coming January. He is a highly recommended (one of the best) endo surgeon and has obviously deemed the risk of leaving my endometrioma there as opposed to excising it a greater risk. I assume this is because I am still so young and not ready to have children, that it will likely grow larger over time and ruin my ovarian reserve further than if he removed it as is being small ish now. 

Now, I’ve had a deep endo scan to plan for the lap, which showed my total AFC is 33. This was a scan with a gynaecologist who specialises in ultrasound and she told me that that this doesn’t mean I qualify for PCOS as both ovaries had < 20 follicles each. A previous ultrasound before this stated I had PCO however. 

Knowing this, my surgeon told me he assumed my AMH would be quite high and ordered a test for me - I assume as a measure to know a baseline of where I’m at pre surgery. He is also an IVF specialist. However my AMH came back at 1.8, around the 10th percentile for my age. This was extremely upsetting for me. However he told me that this is simply only one measure for fertility and with my AFC high, it should not be something I’m stressed about. He has ordered a retest of my AMH with the same lab around 3 months after my surgery.  I’m assuming it will definitely be lower, due to the surgery. He has stated if it is still on the lower side we will talk about freezing eggs. 

This has sent me into a panic. I’m on vitamin D supplements and will also start melatonin in case either of these are falsely (?) causing a lower result for my AMH. Overall, I’m thinking I will definitely need to freeze my eggs, my AMH is so low for my age. I am confused as to why my AFC is high, when I know the two should be correlated with one another. 
Does anyone know what this means? Could someone like me with these levels and endo even hope for a good outcome with frozen eggs? Would I even get a good amount if AMH and AFC are so different?

This is all so heavy as I am so young and none of my friends can relate unfortunately. I’m scrolling infertility support groups constantly and I just have such anxiety about never being able to have babies.

We have been TTC for 23 months now. It’s been a long and emotionally draining process as I’m sure you can understand. My husband finally got an analysis done and the OBGYN said he’s results weren’t good and we should see a fertility specialist.

My infertility background is this: AMH was 0.72 when tested in 2017 when I was 30. We did two rounds of retrieval: first round we got 5 eggs, 3 mature, 2 fertilized, both made it to blast. Second round we got 7 eggs, 6 mature, 2 fertilized, 1 made it to blast. We did an aggressive protocol with max stims and ICSI for both rounds and came out with 3 frozen embryos in the end. We transfered our best embryo that year and had success. We just transfered our last two- one failed to implant and the other stopped developing sometime before our first ultrasound.

I'm lying awake and have to get up in 2 hours for a D&C. The only thing keeping me from going to a dark place is focusing on a plan for what to do next. Egg retrieval was very hard on me emotionally, especially at the end getting the phone calls from the lab with updates. I'm 33 now and have no idea the state of my eggs, but I don't want to waste more time on them. I can't bear another retrieval just to get a couple crappy eggs that might not even make it.

I have become almost immediately obsessed with embryo adoption or using donor eggs. It kind of shocked me how fast my mind made that switch. It feels like it should be a deeper decision, and I wonder if my grief over losing our last two is making me overlook feelings that need more consideration.

My question is for anyone who used/is using donor gametes. Did you mourn the loss of the genetic link to your potential children? Did you take steps to make sure you had thought through any possible ramifications and make sure you had come to terms with your decision?

 Infertility issues are something I would never wish upon my worst enemy.

Infertility is the embodiment of loneliness.

I can deal with the emotions that come with infertility alone. I got that. I can handle that...

but no one ever talked about how to handle the situations around me.

They've done nothing wrong . My coworkers, my friends, my family members. They got pregnant and they talked about their lives. There is nothing inherently wrong with that. They are just making conversation. Talking about their life, their dreams, and their desires. Talking about family planning and when they expect to start trying for another baby.

To give a quick background: I have been TTC for 2.5 years, have done 2 IUIs and 3 FET IVF cycles- one lead to a pregnancy but ended up being a chemical pregnancy. I’ve been diagnosed with unexplained infertility, currently taking a thyroid medication (my levels were normal, but on the “normal high side” so my RE put me on a low dose thyroid medication to see if that makes a difference). I have been tested for autoimmune dxs, genetic karyotyping (my husband has not done karyotyping), as well as all other infertility testing- including endometriosis, HSG, sonohystogram etc -Everything has come back normal. My husband has done 4 semen analyses and all have come back normal as well. We are both 31 years old and healthy. I am a non-smoker, have a healthy/fertility-friendly diet, and don’t consume much alcohol or caffeine. I take Co-Q10 and prenatal vitamins with no synthetics daily.  I have tested my amh levels and recently got tested for pre-menopause (still waiting on those results). Other than my stress-level being probably high from TTC, I’ve never had any medical issues. My GYN has even joked that I’m like a poster for fertility, but for some reason, I still can’t get pregnant. 

My husband and I decided to stop doing IVF and continue trying naturally and for the last 3 consecutive cycles, I have had timed intercourse with confirmed ovulation (through OPKs and day 21 progesterone blood test) and have experienced what I believe to be implantation spotting on either 7-8dpo or 8-9dpo. Last cycle I got a vvvfl 11dpo (I know it could have been a false-positive but given ovulation confirmation, timed intercourse,
And implantation symptoms, I think that was a vvvvfl) then the line disappeared and I got my period 14dpo. This cycle I didn’t test early, but had implantation spotting on 8-9dpo, and just got my period 11dpo. 

Is there a way to pinpoint why a fertilized egg will start to implant, but then fails? I have done progesterone tests and even supported the luteal phase with progesterone suppositories during IVF... when I was doing IVF, my lining was always 9-12mm before they implanted the FET (all 3 of which were good quality, but I didn’t do embryo genetic testing on them). While I haven’t had my lining checked again after we stopped IVF 4 months ago, I know when they measured my lining during IUI, it was never too thin. I am slightly anemic, but all 3 RE’s don’t think that’s the reason why I haven’t gotten pregnant. 

Can anyone advise why I never have a sticky baby?

I have tested my amh levels and recently got tested for pre-menopause (still waiting on those results). Other than my stress-level being probably high from TTC, I’ve never had any medical issues. My GYN has even joked that I’m like a poster for fertility, but for some reason, I still can’t get pregnant. </p>

<p>My husband and I decided to stop doing IVF and continue trying naturally and for the last 3 consecutive cycles, I have had timed intercourse with confirmed ovulation (through OPKs and day 21 progesterone blood test) and have experienced what I believe to be implantation spotting on either 7-8dpo or 8-9dpo. Last cycle I got a vvvfl 11dpo (I know it could have been a false-positive but given ovulation confirmation, timed intercourse,
And implantation symptoms, I think that was a vvvvfl) then the line disappeared and I got my period 14dpo. This cycle I didn’t test early, but had implantation spotting on 8-9dpo, and just got my period 11dpo. </p>

<p>Is there a way to pinpoint why a fertilized egg will start to implant, but then fails? I have done progesterone tests and even supported the luteal phase with progesterone suppositories during IVF... when I was doing IVF, my lining was always 9-12mm before they implanted the FET (all 3 of which were good quality, but I didn’t do embryo genetic testing on them). While I haven’t had my lining checked again after we stopped IVF 4 months ago, I know when they measured my lining during IUI, it was never too thin. I am slightly anemic, but all 3 RE’s don’t think that’s the reason why I haven’t gotten pregnant. </p>

<p>Can anyone advise why I never have a sticky baby? Is there a test or anything out there I’m not aware of that could pin point why it starts to implant but then fails between 11-14dpo?</p>

223,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone, I'm new here but have been reading through the community posts for weeks. I really like your vibe here of no cutesy-ness, and I hope to be an active member here!

I'm going through a psychologically rough patch after my first IVF frozen cycle and I'm wracked with indecision and wanted to get some thoughts from people who might be/have been in my shoes.

I was happy/grateful to get 3 PGS normal/euploid blasts from my first cycle, which is one more than average for my age (36). However, when I got the live birth rates from my RE and genetic counselor, I became worried the percentages would not be enough for the 2 children I dreamed of. It feels like nearly a coin flip. In particular, I'm freaked out about the scenario where FET #1 would be successful, but #2 and #3 wouldn't, and I would have lost all that time and be 38.5 or 39 doing IVF again (with a small child, a career that's hopefully on the upswing, having to rush through breastfeeding, and likely a lot of anxiety).

Right now my husband and I are trying to decide between:

a) doing another IVF cycle to bank more blastocysts (best case scenario: we have the blasts we need in some order for 2 kids and I can proceed with much less anxiety; scary scenario: excess embryos which would weigh on us for years.)

b) proceeding to FET (best case scenario: we DO have just the right # of blasts but just don't know that for sure going in; scary scenario: as mentioned above, lost time with a successful #1, unsuccessful #2/3, IVF again older, and no guarantee of a second kid)

c) do a frozen \*egg\* cycle only. My husband already has frozen sperm. My RE did not bring this up; I did as a possible ""middle ground"" where we'd only move on to fertilization if needed. She warned us it's far from a sure-thing insurance plan, with fewer eggs surviving a thaw than embryos and more unknowns with the freezing, thawing, re-freeze for PGS.

Additional stats:

* I'm 36.5, my husband is 44.5
* Diagnosis MFI, no other known issues except my hypothryodism which will be controlled carefully before transfer
* No history of past known pregnancies for either of us
* I apparently have high AMH for my age
* Morphology of euploid blasts: 6-day 3AB, 5-day 3BB, another 5-day 3BB
* Statistics given to us of live births: 65%, 60%, 60% respectively
* Retrieval was 15 eggs (all mature), 10 fertilized normally (2pn), 6 blastocysts, 3 PGS normal (1 mosaic we're cautioned is very unlikely, and 2 aneuploid)
* Crazily, the sex of all 3 PGS blasts (and the 1 mosiac) are all the same. It's the sex I was NOT expecting or ever imagined having, but I'm coming around to it and realized I would be happy with children of any sex/gender/gender expression and don't want that to be a determining factor.

I've been through every scenario in my head hundreds of times. My anxiety is nearly unmanageable right now (though I'm getting professional help). This feels like the most significant and difficult decision of my life. I feel strongly one way one day and another the next. Two kids is my dream (sibling relationship very important in my life) and I regret getting started so late. 

Husband and I not religious but scared about the emotional ramifications of unused embryos, and I think the feeling we took it too far ""playing god"" or something. The root of the dilemma I think is ultimately our ambivalence is how we view these 100-cell clumps -- as a future child we really want to get to know, or a possibility/step along the way to build our family. 

If I'd gotten 2 blasts I know I'd be doing another IVF cycle; if I got 4 I would almost definitely proceed to FET with excitement. 3 seems like the hardest number with no guarantees, yet I've grown attached to the idea of them.

Not having a plan is kind of torturing me. The whole ""I have embryos outside of my body"" thing is weirder than I thought. I also thought IVF would give more control but instead it feels like an illusion of control, with so many unknowns. I feel like I have to plan my whole life now and I'm petrified, physically nauseous and heart-racing for long stretches of each day.

225,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,

Happy to be part of this community as I am very new to my diagnosis and I'm trying to learn everything I can before it's too late.

I recently found out that my AMH is very very low, like 0.14 low. MY FSH is 25 IU and I had 3 follicles. I am 34. I've seen the charts that my dr showed me and people in their 40s don't even have AMH this low. I don't fully understand what this means and would love if if someone spells it out for me in plain blunt English. Here are my questions. 

* What does it mean to have 0.14 AMH? Does this mean there's a chance I won't have my own biological kids if my FSH doesn't decrease? 
* Has anyone been able to decrease their FSH so that they are able to produce good quality eggs? I'll be working very very hard on that and have the book 'it starts with the egg'
* Does a low AMH mean I have few eggs? 
* Can I still increase my AMH or is it really too late for me?
* Why is my AMH so low? Is this from years of mistreatment of my body? I thought I was relatively healthy, I just eat a lot of sweet stuff. But no drinking, no drugs, no coffee...

<p>Happy to be part of this community as I am very new to my diagnosis and I&#39;m trying to learn everything I can before it&#39;s too late.</p>

<p>I recently found out that my AMH is very very low, like 0.14 low. MY FSH is 25 IU and I had 3 follicles. I am 34. I&#39;ve seen the charts that my dr showed me and people in their 40s don&#39;t even have AMH this low. I don&#39;t fully understand what this means and would love if if someone spells it out for me in plain blunt English. Here are my questions. </p>

<ul>
<li>What does it mean to have 0.14 AMH? Does this mean there&#39;s a chance I won&#39;t have my own biological kids if my FSH doesn&#39;t decrease? </li>
<li>Has anyone been able to decrease their FSH so that they are able to produce good quality eggs? I&#39;ll be working very very hard on that and have the book &#39;it starts with the egg&#39;</li>
<li>Does a low AMH mean I have few eggs? </li>
<li>Can I still increase my AMH or is it really too late for me?</li>
<li>Why is my AMH so low? Is this from years of mistreatment of my body? I thought I was relatively healthy, I just eat a lot of sweet stuff. But no drinking, no drugs, no coffee...</li>
<li>I know this news is bad news. But how bad is it? Will I hit menopause early?</li>

I posted in the dailies last week, but someone suggested to try again after the holidays! 

I am 34, and my diagnosis includes low AMH (0.8ng/ml) and an AFC of around 10. My husband's morph was slightly down (3%).

My RE has recommended we go straight to IVF if we pursue any treatment, and has recommended a testosterone priming protocol. I'm in Australia so the drug names might be different, but it involves:
-21 days of progynovna (estrogen) and primolut
-starting 5 days later, 21 days of testosterone gel
-then start stims of 300 FSH
-antagonist on day 6 of FSH

I'm just wondering if anyone has tried a similar protocol, and what their experiences were?

Bonus question - I'm having some uterus surgery this week that could help our chances of conceiving. My RE said we could either try ourselves for 3 months post surgery, or jump straight into IVF. I'm leaning towards the latter as I'll regret not doing so 3 months down the track if we're unsuccessful. Any thoughts given our diagnosis?

Thanks in advance!

I went through 2 IVF cycles (Jan 2019 and April 2019) resulting in one PGS/PGD normal embryo and one low level mosaic/PGD normal embryo, which we plan to use. Although we've produced lot of embryos, we lose 50% of our embryos to a genetic disorder  and several more to PGS.


I've been through 2 cancelled ERA mock FET cycles and 1 cancelled FET cycle due to lining issues. My clinic has not let me try a ""natural"" FET and seems adverse to them. Instead, I've tried 2 cancelled mock FETs for ERA with various doses of vaginal estrogen and one cancelled FET (physician decided to stop pursuing the ERA) with 2 weeks of Lupron followed by vaginal estrogen. I decided to take a breather in October and resume FETs in January.


We found out our insurance next year will cover IVF! So we're considering doing another retreival  and looking at other clinics that are out of state and would require remote monitoring/travel. However, the out of state clinic I spoke with today recommended transferring embryos where they were created rather than shipping them to another clinic. This means if I want to use my existing embryos my current clinic would need to transfer them.


I don't really want to go through another retrieval since my last one resulted in zero useable embryos and benched me for awhile due to moderate OHSS. We'd like two kids but at this point I'd be happy with one.


Should I try to transfer what I have locally before switching clinics and doing another retrieval? Should I push harder to ship my embryos to the new clinic if I go forward with them? Should I just do another retrieval locally?

I’m a 32 year old woman. My husband and I are not actively trying for kids right now and have never tried for them but I want them in the (near) future.

We are having major financial issues and have had some other set back and we simply aren’t in the position to raise a family right now and won’t be for a few years at least.

I am concerned about my age and my fertility in general. I’ll be 33 in a few months, and I know fertility drops sharply with age.

I’m also concerned because about a year and a half ago I went off the birth control pill and this entire year, we have been really bad about condom use. My husband finally confessed last night that he’s a little concerned I might be infertile because I never got pregnant despite him basically just using the pull out method for like a year (and not very well).

We know he is not infertile, at least as of 12-15 years ago.

I have only very basic health insurance so I’m afraid if I go to the doctor I’ll end up with lab work that will cost me thousands of dollars I don’t have. Plus since we haven’t been actively trying maybe the doctor will just say it’s too soon to test for that? I really have no experience with this sort of thing!

I was thinking about saving up and taking one of those at home fertility tests that cost like $160, like Modern Fertility. Is that even worth it just to get some basic info? $160 is a lot of money for me to invest in this so I need to choose a test wisely if I do one at all. Is there another company that’s better? Is there anything else I can do to find out if I am actually infertile or have some issues that need to be addressed before actively trying for a baby that won't cost me a ton?

I recently went back on the pill and I hate it so if I am infertile or find it will be difficult to conceive due to a problem with me, the silver lining would be I could get at least off of it.

Edited to Add: My mom had fertility issues back in the 1980s when she had me and my two siblings.  It took her 4 years to get pregnant with her first.  I don't know exactly what the problem was but I do know it was a problem with her and not my dad.  Unfortunately I can't ask her because she passed away 4 years ago.

The last year, I've been really struggling. My husband's cousin, who always expressed she didn't really want children, got pregnant. Wonderful for her, so excited, but that's where the feeling of ""why not me?"" Really started to set in. 

Then mother's day this year, my older sister, who also has also always said she didn't want kids, announced she was pregnant. I was completely blindsided. I'm so thrilled for her, but also again, so incredibly dad for myself and my husband. 

I cry at even the thought of being in the same room as one of the babies, and now that the holidays are here, as well as one of the babies (the other is probably arriving next week) I just want to curl into a ball and cry myself to sleep.

Today we're supposed to be going to the cousin's house to meet the baby, and even though I've tried to be a good sport, I don't think I can walk into a house full of people and keep my shit together. I also note am doubting if I'll be able to go to the hospital when my sister has her baby without being a basketcase.

Sorry for the long post and any typos. I've been up panicking and crying at the idea of going to visit today. For the last two hours.

Thanks to anyone who read this.

Edit- Thank you for the responses. My eyes are so red and puffy it looks like I have pinkeye- probably couldn't go now even if I did have a sudden miraculous change of heart. I did in fact ""call off sick"" for today's events.

I also reached out to try to make an appointment with a therapist. So hopefully I can talk to someone in person soon.

Thanks again.

After 2+ years of trying, 4 IUIs, 3 miscarriages and now my first round of IVF we only retrieved TWO mature eggs. I’m so fucking upset and feel like I’m just wasting my time. 

To make it all worse the nurse told me when I woke up from anesthesia that they got 10 eggs, I was puzzled cause I only had 7 follicles but even after I asked “are you sure” she said “yes!”  5 mins later she comes back to say she’s sorry, but that the number is 7. Ok, 7 isn’t 10 but it’s better than what I thought they would retrieve (3) Then my doctor comes in to tell me that she was surprised that I had two good sized follicles in addition to the 3 she was expecting, so now that  brings my total to 5 possible mature eggs. My husband and I are so happy at this point because this whole time we thought we would only get 3. Now this is where I almost lost my mind.. the nurse comes back in and says “good news... two of your eggs are mature!” GOOD NEWS?!

I am 31 and am annovulatory. I don't have PCOS as far as I know. November was my first cycle taking Femara. My CD1 was November 7th and I was prescribed 5mg Femara daily on CD's 3-7. I started doing OPK's on CD8 and didn't stop taking them until CD21. I never got a positive OPK the whole time. I went into my OB on CD21 for my blood test for progesterone. It was only labs so I didn't get to talk to my OB at all. I briefly mentioned all of my negative OPK's to a MA and she agreed that it was unlikely that I ovulated this cycle. Well yesterday was CD22 and I had EWCM for the first time this cycle, however I do have EWCM at least once every cycle and I haven't been ovulating for a long time.

I started doing OPK&#39;s on CD8 and didn&#39;t stop taking them until CD21. I never got a positive OPK the whole time. I went into my OB on CD21 for my blood test for progesterone.

279,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi Everyone:

I am on my second IUI (happened yesterday) and second round of letrozole. I am on a low dose (2.5) from CD 5-9. I also have only one ovary. I lost one to a dermoid cyst over a decade ago.

My ovary is responding to the letrozole, but it is very hard to see on US (it hangs out behind my uterus), so lots of shadows and US take much longer than the average person because it hides.

First round (negative pregnancy test), I had a positive opk when the follicles they saw were at 16.5. This round, I went in for a mid-cycle scan and I had two follicles @ 12.5mm. The next morning blazing positive and trigger, IUI the next day.

My question is, do you think the nurse is missing a follicle on the US since my ovary is so hard to see? Has this happened to anyone?

Or, is my body not cooperating?

My RE isn't that helpful (the nurses are), so I thought I would ask you all your insight?",,False,,0,False,"Blazing positive ovulation test, but follicles small?",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_e2xb6r,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,,self,False,,,{},,True,,1574972444.0,text,0,,,,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi Everyone:</p>
