My husband always had almost no ejaculate whatsoever to even test. He was tested for all causes and everything was normal except his testosterone was 286 when for his age (27 at the time) it should have been much much higher. Fast forward to six months taking Clomid (50mg every other day) and using Sudafed to stimulate nerves to project ejaculate out (he also has nerve damage due to abdominal surgeries performed before 12mo old) and he was finally able to produce a sample to test.

His testosterone blood work came back at 1131 (above range) and his free testosterone (the important kind for fertility) rose to 29 (above average range 9-26). His SA results read like this:

Total volume measured: <1.4mL (below normal)
172.6 mil sperm per mL (well above normal range of 33mil/mL)
25% motility (below normal with >38% being normal)
5% morphology (ref range >3% so good enough for IVF)

We were shocked and happy and ecstatic and I had to share the good news and hope for those in a similar situation. We also deal with me having endometriosis, a possible uterine septum, and a growing ovarian endometrioma so we still need IVF but thanks to Clomid, we don't have to worry about needing TESE or that sort of thing.

But this will only get worse because of how close this is to me.  I&#39;m hoping they just go live somewhere else, which is something they both want.  I&#39;ve completely stopped trying to hide this from myself.  Yes I&#39;ll be happy for them, of course I will.  Eventually. </p>

I asked the reproductive immunologist I work with, Dr. Jeffrey Braverman http://www.preventmiscarriage.com/Our-Services.aspx  if he would be interested in doing an AMA for our sub and he is happy to answer questions from our group. It won't be a live AMA as we know it however. Dr. Braverman will not be in reddit himself but will answer a handful of questions from our community and the mods and I will post his answers. The mod team has verified Dr. Braverman's identity and we will be copy/pasting his answers.    


If you would like to ask a question about immunology or any of Braverman's specialties please post a question here on this thread before this Sunday, June 14th at 5 pm EST. I will send 10 -12 questions to him and once he has answered, we will create a thread for his answers and any follow up questions for him.    


I do suggest looking over his website before asking questions to gain an idea of the scope of his practice. Also please try to make the questions more general (vs your personal situation) in nature so we can all learn from the answers.     


This is the full diagnostic immune testing that he does. http://www.preventmiscarriage.com/Our-Diagnostic-Testing-Panel.aspx
Here are papers he has written including the one I mentioned in the daily thread yesterday about him finding 3 PGS  abnormal embryos that ended up as 3 healthy babies. http://www.preventmiscarriage.com/Lectures-Papers.aspx       
 



Who is Dr. Jeffrey Braverman?    



Dr. Braverman is the founder and Medical Director at Braverman Reproductive Immunology with offices in Long Island and Manhattan.

Dr. Braverman was honored as the youngest graduate at New York University where he was accepted at the age of 14. He went on to attend Medical School at The Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan and completed his internship and residency at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York.

After completing his residency Dr. Braverman established a private medical practice in Long Island New York. For more than 20 years, Dr. Braverman has been treating patients with all complications related to Recurrent Pregnancy Loss and has become one of the nation's leading authorities in the field Reproductive Immunology. He has managed thousands of cycles of IUI and IVF with a large majority of his patients suffering from Recurrent Pregnancy Loss and Failure to initiate and Successfully Complete a Pregnancy (RPL and FISCP). He has consistently maintained one of the highest success rates in New York despite the complexity of his case load. For the last three years in a row, his practice was voted the Best Infertility Practice on Long Island in an independent poll conducted by the Long Island Press.

Dr. Braverman has published articles in the field of high risk obstetrics related to IUGR, Gestational Diabetes, and Fetal Distress and has gained unequaled experience managing as well as delivering this High Risk group of patients. In fact Dr. Braverman has delivered well over 5000 babies in his career. He has been featured with his RPL autoimmune patients on Discovery Channels Baby Story, local TV news stations, and has hosted numerous radio shows on reproductive immunology and fertility.

He assists and consults with patients from around the world with problems related to RPL and FISCP. He has designed the most complete panel for the diagnosis and management of immune related pregnancy complications, as well as one of the most comprehensive thrombophilia (blood clotting) panels available.


Dr Braverman is currently serving as co-chairman for the American Society of Reproductive Immunology (ASRI)

(BTW, out of 19 eggs that were taken from me, only 7 were successfully fertilized and frozen ... does that number seem small to you?)  

Anyways, I live in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, and there is this chalk board Courage Wall that has been up for a few months.

I think I have handled infertility fairly well ... I'm pretty positive about everything and hopeful about the future.  In the beginning, I really didn't want to tell people.  For the most part, I still feel that way.  But, this morning, while walking by the Courage Wall I just had this BURNING need to let my secret go.  So, I grabbed some chalk and wrote I wish I had the courage to be open about my infertility.  And then I walked away to go get coffee.

On my way back, there was a guy reading the wall.  We randomly started talking, laughing about the courage to finish homework and go skydiving, and then he said ""But, look at how deep some of these are.  Have you read the one about infertility?""

Our visit with the RE went well and I was reminded why I picked this clinic in the first place; my doctor knows her shit, but is also very nice/empathetic, so overall I feel like we're in good hands.  My husband seemed to like her, too.  I also got to meet the IVF coordinator for the first time.  She's great!  I definitely feel like I can work with her.  We got a schedule and our protocol.  Looks like we'll be stimming the first couple of weeks of July, then retrieval sometime in mid-July, with a FET in August or the first part of September.

Then we met with the financial coordinator. Long story short, it's going to cost about 5k more than we have and I don't know where we're going to get the money by the deadline (July 2nd).  She just kind of threw a bunch of information at us and left.  I thought I knew how much it was going to cost, but apparently I was wrong.  No idea how I made that mistake; I think I assumed that the cost would include one FET (obviously others would be extra), which it of course does not.  Yup, I'm an idiot.  Worst case scenario I guess, we have to wait 3-4 months to save up the additional 5k, but we left feeling defeated and overwhelmed.  My husband was downright angry: angry at the clinic because he felt they weren't being straight with us about the cost and are overcharging, but also angry that we live in a country that just doesn't give a fuck about helping people like us.  

Overall I just feel guilty.  My husband doesn't care nearly as much about having kids as I do, but now we have to clean out our entire savings for a dream only really one of us shares.  Mr. Kitteh wants to save for a house and finally splurge on some things now that he has a new job after 5 years of school.  Thanks to me, to my troll body, however, he can't do that anymore and it makes me feel like shit. 

To be clear, Mr. Kitteh has been nothing but supportive and is totally fine with spending the money on this.  He told me again and again that he wants me to be happy and if this is what we need to do, then it's worth it.  I guess right now I'm just questioning whether it's worth it for us to spend $20,000 just to have the CHANCE at a baby....ya know?  Especially when it's really only for me, not him.

I used to be an athlete, and I was strong and looked really good and had a fun community around my sport, and I had goals for competition and busted my ass to meet them. Then something in the depths of my troll brain decided that exercise was causing me to not get pregnant. This was long before I ever saw an RE or had a diagnosis.

There’s a lot of Catholic guilt mixed up in here. I have a lot of childhood programming that if you want to be worthy you have to suffer, and give up what you love, and not feel proud about yourself. I don’t believe in any of it anymore but obviously I still do believe it because I immediately rolled over and gave everything up.

No more gym. Sit on my ass for 18 months, gain a bunch of weight, get more and more depressed, miss everyone at the gym, miss having a hobby. Then I had an early MC a few months ago. After that I decided to take a break from TTC and to work out instead, try to look and feel better.

I’ve been going to a different gym (not ready to recommit to my sport yet) and even though it’s only been a few weeks, I can see the difference. It’s a really intense workout, which is what I love. I can feel it too. I get choked up during workouts sometimes because it feels so good to care about myself and be doing something good for myself.

But this month I wanted to get back on the horse, do another IUI. Cue immediate freakout about the gym. I just called the RE to talk about it, and after explaining to the dumbass reception lady that no, I don’t need to schedule a pre-natal visit because THAT BABY IS ALREADY DEAD, I talked to a nurse who said, “oh no, don’t do anything that makes you sweat. Try some gentle yoga.” You know what, fuck gentle yoga. Fuck a leisurely walk, and fuck hating the way I look. FUCK EVERYTHING.

Cool, so it really does come down to feeling good about myself or (maaaybe, maybe maybe maybe) getting a baby.

I see my nephews and I recently don&#39;t even feel sad about &#39;missing out.&#39; Instead I watch my SIL chase a kid around, changing diapers, deal with screaming and I just think &#39;ugh.&#39; My best friend with her new born and 4 yr old who is acting out and she&#39;s not getting any rest, and I just think how much that would suck. Not sure what&#39;s going on. I&#39;m worried I&#39;m in this place and a decade from now I&#39;ll wonder what the hell was wrong with me and why I &#39;gave up. &#39; I guess we&#39;ll see what the RE says and go from there. WTF brain
EDIT: Found out husband has balanced translocation :(  We didn&#39;t expect that news at all. I feel like I&#39;ve been hating myself for so long for not being able to do this, but my pcos was only a fraction of the problem. We&#39;re a team and we&#39;ll get through this</p>

We've been trying to start IVF, but 3 cycles in a row I had an estrogen producing cyst and it was shut down. A different estrogen producing cyst, mind, because it alternated sides.

So I don't know if this whole thing is to review my protocol and make big changes, or to say that IVF is actually a much shittier proposition than they'd thought and perhaps I should consider not having genetic children.

My husband (41) and I (31) have been trying to conceive since December 2013, so over 18 months now. I've had all my basic tests done, and everything has come back normal. Husband's sperm analysis came back twice with a low count, and he also has low levels of testosterone. Since lurking I've learnt a lot about motility and so forth, I don't know what any of that is like for us.

Until recently, I have been very ambivalent about having a child. I struggle with occasionally severe mental illness, which I am terrified of passing on to my children. For years I thought perhaps I just shouldn't have kids. But hubby really wants them, so I agreed for his sake. Over the last 18 months I have come to realise that I really truly desperately want a child, and I feel like if I can't give him one, I will be a failure, a waste of space.

The time has come for me to broach the subject of assisted fertility with my GP, and I am a bit nervous about the whole thing - what's involved, what it will cost, and how I will cope if it doesn't work, or worse - if I do get pregnant and the baby dies.

My friends are either childless by choice, or ridiculously fertile, so I don't even know if or how I can talk to them about all this. I see a counsellor and my GP regularly, due to my mental illness, so that helps, and of course the wonderful community here.

We had ups and downs, but she was my closest friend - really supportive, straight talking, happy hour getting, I'm-there-for-you type stuff. 

She was upset when I told her I was moving, but she got over it. We've definitely drifted apart some in the last couple of years, but we do see each other every 6 months or so, and we interact online and text sporadically.

We chatted and went back and forth, and she was happy I'd reached out. 

I held off on telling her about my IF diagnosis because I knew she was having a hard time, and because of the reason for her breakup, the topic just seemed extra fraught.

There&#39;s a lengthy thread on a particular overseas clinic, which the women on that forum gush over.  When I contacted this particular clinic with a query, I was astonished at their &quot;one size fits none&quot; approach.  The coordinator is not medically trained and yet proceeded to offer an inferior treatment at a vastly inflated cost.

We fight, we make up, we're there for each other when shit hits the fan, which it so frequently does. As much as individual family members might drive us crazy from time to time, we're united against Infertility. We have each others' backs when it counts, because we all understand the special Hell that we're all suffering.

But things get more complicated when people who don't understand that Hell, walk into our family spats and feel the need to contribute. The internet is a pretty sketchy place, and anonymity makes people feel powerful, so these outsiders go WAY beyond what would be appropriate even IF their contribution was welcome.

Because this is a public sub, trolls are going to happen. We mods do our best to keep you safe from them, but some get through. It happens. But here's the thing:

**Every time someone links us to subredditdrama, the troll traffic increases drastically**

and I'm not just talking about the stuff that you see, that gets by us, or even the stuff that we see and stop before it gets to you. When people link us to subredditdrama, members of our sub become victims via PM to trolls who get their jollies from telling us about their abortions, telling us we don't deserve children, telling us horrible, horrible things. Things no one should have to hear, and things that we *never* want our family members to have to read.

Now, the official rules of subredditdrama ban users who vote or comment on the threads linked there, but that isn't a rule that is very hard to get around. After all, it's easy to have one username for subredditdrama and another to harass innocent redditors. So, we don't know if that's what's happening, or if people are lurking at subredditdrama and trolling us, or if subredditdrama is going to r/all and people are finding us there, but the fact remains that linking to subredditdrama brings trolls to us Every. Single. Time.

And that is not okay.

So, here's a new rule, and it's one that won't affect very many of you, but it's important.

***No linking infertility sub posts to subs outside of the infertility family*** This means no crossposting, and no sharing of /r/infertility, /r/secondaryinfertility, /r/infertilitybabies, or /r/infertilitysucks links in other subs outside of the subs you know are a part of our infertility family. It's pretty simple. Keep our family's dirty laundry in the family. Don't invite trolls into our home.

I'm new here. /wave

I have PCOS and am 29. I'm currently TTC #2 through FET as I had four blastocysts remaining from my last IVF cycle.

I got pregnant with my first FET. I was thrilled; it felt like a miracle. Well, it was too good to be true--I had a blighted ovum and miscarried on (Anerican) Mother's Day.

I don't really feel comfortable trying to ship my embryos across the pond, you know?

My clinic has been as supportive as possible to try to get another transfer attempt in before I go. I didn't shed enough lining from the MC, so I was told to wait until CD 16 (as the miscarriage was CD 1) and take Norethisterone for a week.

I stopped taking it on Monday and was supposed to have a baseline scan tomorrow, but I had to cancel since I haven't bled yet. They're having me come in Monday whether I have bled or not.

The last time I took Norethisterone was my original IVF cycle (in 2012 so I can't remember how long it took to bleed (I had a random natural period before FET). But the clinic obviously thought I would have bled by now because they booked my scan for tomorrow.

I have private insurance with Kaiser Permanente and no fertility coverage at all, so I've been going to an outside RE for most of the infertility stuff, though I've done a few basic things with KP and they know what's going on and are getting copies of test results, etc.  I know they're going to try not to cover the salpingectomy because it's related to infertility and IVF prep.  I would expect the endo and uterine laparoscopy to be covered though, as those are related to my health, not infertility.  I am gearing up for a fight with them, because there is no way I can afford both the laparoscopy/salpingectomy *and* IVF.  And I think KP should cover at least the endo/polyp investigation.  

This might be relevant: a year before seeking treatment for infertility, I had gone to KP because my periods were becoming less regular, and I was experiencing some twinges and strange sensations, and even some pain in my uterine and ovarian areas.

My primary care physician did a few basic blood tests and pelvic ultrasound and found nothing.

I'm looking for advice about how to address this with KP and what would my best avenue to get at least part of this covered.

My hubby and I just started TTC in May!  I have both PCOS and hypothyroidism and have been on Metformin since March. It seemed to regulate my cycle somewhat from what was 45 + long cycles to  28 day cycles for March and April. I was excited as we had planned on May start date for trying to conceive for a while and of course once my progesterone was done in May and was a level 3 this current cycle is going on 38 days now. I'm not pregnant but super discouraged that my first month trying seems to be an anovulatory one and now it's a long cycle too. I'm worried the Metformin has stopped working even tho I'm at max dose.

My OBGYN had put me on it and wants me to get my day 21 progesterone done every month from here on out. I'm wondering if an RE would be more proactive but it looks like most REs work out of fertility clinics which seem expensive.

I have MSP coverage and my hubby gets benefits that MIGHT cover things thru work but I'm not sure how much it costs and how it works. Anyone have any advice?

They tried his sample on 15 hamster eggs (apparently these are close to human eggs for the purpose of fertilization) and 0 fertilized. My husband is on the low end of normal for count and motility, he's normal for morphology. So he has sperm, and his SA results have always been fine, which is why nobody really did any further digging, until we started gearing up for IVF. 

On the one hand, this explains that we've tried for over two years with not even a chemical pregnancy. Nothing has ever combined in there. I have never had any negative fertility results, my piece of the puzzle seems to be shockingly normal. So I was starting to feel crazy that we'd tried about 26 cycles and had absolutely, positively nothing to show for it. This is awesome closure. On the other hand, this is obviously hard news to take. Our frustrating road has already led us to our first IVF cycle beginning in less than two weeks, and, with these results in hand, we've obviously decided to do ICSI. But I felt something taken from us in that doctor's meeting: The off chance that we'll conceive naturally at some point down the line. I had always hung on to the hope that maybe we just weren't hitting the right luck.

Is there anything that can make a difference with this issue for him? If I had egg problems, I'd be more willing to accept that we're just SOL, because I can't make new eggs. But a man makes new sperm all the time. Is his sperm manufacturing equipment just manufacturing incompetent sperm? Can it stamp them out a little bit differently? Has has anyone done any research and found a method for changing his situation? Like, if he were to take some supplements, etc. etc. etc. etc.

My understanding is that this is an enzyme issue. The head of his sperm doesn't have the right enzymes for the job. Can it...get them? Somehow? I know I'm in a ""good"" place, relatively, because IVF is good at addressing the exact kind of issue that we have. So that's something to be very grateful for.

163,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I was thinking it was time that I posted an update to my introduction post since a lot seems to have happened since then. My intro post can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/33ax4d/intro_and_mini_rant/).

Long story short, my husband had testicular cancer and after chemo another tumor was found that required a major surgery called a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. So not only did chemo effect his fertility, but now he has retrograde ejaculation (nothing comes out but everything else functions perfectly) so we *really* have no chance of trying naturally right now. This may improve with time (years?) or it may not as it is due to nerve damage. 

My husband and I went to Memorial Sloan Kettering in April for his first post-surgical CT scan. Unfortunately, after being told that everything looked good on first look, the final radiology report indicated that there was one suspicious lymph node in his pelvis. Instead of his next CT being in a year, we are going back in September to confirm whether it is just inflammation or another tumor that would require yet another operation. Needless to say we have been pretty crushed as this once again puts everything on hold until we know he will be ok and that this stupid cancer shit is behind us (as much as it every actually can be). 

In early March I was advised by our RE (Shady Grove Fertility) to go off birth control to figure out where my body stands as we prepare for IVF in the coming (insert unknown timeline here... it was supposed to be fall but with the CT scan looming over us we no longer think that it is reasonable). I had one normal period after a 41 day cycle and then nothing. I am on CD45 today and I *think* I might be feeling a little bit of pain in my woman bits but its hard to tell. Also, I have somehow managed to gain about 10 lbs since going off BC, and I have no idea why. I'm not really eating any different and I am actually working out more (2 intense days a week versus nothing before). It is incredibly frustrating. Since my husband's diagnosis in Dec 2013 I have struggled with sudden onset acne issues that I haven't been able to shake and now with the weight gain (I was already 10 lbs over my ideal weight) I have been feeling pretty down and like there might be something off with me. Maybe I am still adjusting to being off of BC/still coping physically with everything we have been through? Any insight? How did you all do when you went off of BC? 

Our RE suggested that regardless of our IVF timeline I should consider getting some routine tests this summer to see where I stand (I believe d3 ultrasound and bloodwork, HSG, and I think tests for ovarian reserve). I haven't decided how to proceed yet but with my period failing to make an appearance I haven't been able to move forward anyways. 

I have been trying very hard to stay positive and keep living life to the fullest, but I am increasingly aware that we are approaching the time that we planned to try to start out own family. Instead of being excited to try for baby xia, I am worried about my husband's health as well as my own (obviously his much more than mine, but it sucks to feel like your body is a bit out of control...). What doesn't help is that I am absolutely **SURROUNDED** by babies and pregnant women. After a week filled with a baby shower and a big family pregnancy announcement on my husband's side, our best friends announced that they were pregnant with their second when they came to support us at the Relay for Life this weekend. I knew the moment she walked up to us that she was pregnant... and when she said the words my heart sank. It isn't that I'm not thrilled for them, it was just that it wasn't the time or place. We worked so hard to raise money for this great cause on our little two person team and it was a day to celebrate how far we have come and remember those who had lost the fight against their disease. I just felt like it shouldn't have been about their new baby and it really took away from what should have been a very special day for *us*. On top of that, I feel like everyone around me that is pregnant or has kids is constantly complaining to me about said pregnancy or kids and it makes me want to punch them in the face. *Le sigh*

My intro post can be found <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/33ax4d/intro_and_mini_rant/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Long story short, my husband had testicular cancer and after chemo another tumor was found that required a major surgery called a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. So not only did chemo effect his fertility, but now he has retrograde ejaculation (nothing comes out but everything else functions perfectly) so we <em>really</em> have no chance of trying naturally right now. This may improve with time (years?) or it may not as it is due to nerve damage. </p>

<p>My husband and I went to Memorial Sloan Kettering in April for his first post-surgical CT scan. Unfortunately, after being told that everything looked good on first look, the final radiology report indicated that there was one suspicious lymph node in his pelvis. Instead of his next CT being in a year, we are going back in September to confirm whether it is just inflammation or another tumor that would require yet another operation. Needless to say we have been pretty crushed as this once again puts everything on hold until we know he will be ok and that this stupid cancer shit is behind us (as much as it every actually can be). </p>

<p>In early March I was advised by our RE (Shady Grove Fertility) to go off birth control to figure out where my body stands as we prepare for IVF in the coming (insert unknown timeline here... it was supposed to be fall but with the CT scan looming over us we no longer think that it is reasonable). I had one normal period after a 41 day cycle and then nothing. I am on CD45 today and I <em>think</em> I might be feeling a little bit of pain in my woman bits but its hard to tell. Also, I have somehow managed to gain about 10 lbs since going off BC, and I have no idea why. I&#39;m not really eating any different and I am actually working out more (2 intense days a week versus nothing before). It is incredibly frustrating. Since my husband&#39;s diagnosis in Dec 2013 I have struggled with sudden onset acne issues that I haven&#39;t been able to shake and now with the weight gain (I was already 10 lbs over my ideal weight) I have been feeling pretty down and like there might be something off with me. Maybe I am still adjusting to being off of BC/still coping physically with everything we have been through? Any insight? How did you all do when you went off of BC? </p>

<p>Our RE suggested that regardless of our IVF timeline I should consider getting some routine tests this summer to see where I stand (I believe d3 ultrasound and bloodwork, HSG, and I think tests for ovarian reserve). I haven&#39;t decided how to proceed yet but with my period failing to make an appearance I haven&#39;t been able to move forward anyways. </p>

My office is right down the hall from an OB/GYN office, which normally doesn't bother me. I'm getting a lot better at just shrugging things off. Except for today. Today, my SO is going to MEPS to re-enlist into the military. All he could talk about last night and this morning as that MAYBE on Tricare we can get the infertility meds covered as our current insurance doesn't cover them.

Then we get a call from the OB office. One of their patients has gallbladder issues, she's TTC again and just had a baby boy 5 months ago. While I was taking her vitals, she was lamenting how easy it was to get pregnant with her first two kids and trying to get pregnant this time around was so much harder. They've been trying for two months already. Again, this normally doesn't phase me but today it just hit me hard.

I reacted beautifully to the letrozole with 2 18mm follicles at CD 12 and subsequent trigger CD14 with IUI 36 hours later.  Unfortunately it failed.

This month we are taking off as the doctor didn't get back to me in time to start the regimen.  My normal cycles are about 25-27 days long with ovulation around CD 12-14.  So I got shmmancy and bought a ClearBlue Easy Advanced OPK and tested yesterday (CD6) and it says low fertility.  Today, CD7, it says high fertility.  I figured it was a fluke so I checked second morning urine with a cheapie Wondfo, and it's about halfway positive like it usually is the day before I get an actual positive (CD10-11).  What the hell?  It's way too early to ovulate.

We’ve gone through 3 failed FETs in the last year, and the 3rd was particularly emotionally draining in April. The hubs and I decided that it was time for a break from fertility and upon this decision we IMMEDIATELY felt a weight lifted. 

The thought of enjoying our summer, not scheduling our lives around appts or meds, or symptoms, or emotional outbursts….ah… doesn’t that sound amazing? We think so!

I let it all go. Really… in a matter of a few days I had let it go and started to feel AMAZING. I know we’ll get back to it in September, but for now, let’s enjoy each other, go on vacation (we booked a trip to Japan!) and just chillax. We NEED this time to decompress and prepare for the continued fertility journey ahead, and so we’re taking it.

So this week, I was supposed to get my period last Saturday. My period is very regular, always starting at around 28-30 days. In the past I’ve had it start at 31 days, and a couple years ago there was once a stretch when I was *certain* I was preggers because I stretched to 33 days before starting. 33 days is now my benchmark for extended start, though I've only experienced this once.

This week, day 31 came and went. I didn’t notice. 32 and 33 and I started wearing my pad. 34 and I wore a pad and carried a tampon in my pocket. Any time now!

35, nothing. 36, nothing. 37, nothing. At this point I start to hope. I mean… wouldn’t you? I tell my husband I’m NOT going to take a test because I “won’t be deceived again.” I also tell him about the ongoing joke amongst fertility ladies, “if you ever want your period to start on command, just take a pregnancy test.” 

But as day 37 continues on, I REALLY start to convince myself. 

This. Is. It. 

I’m pregnant! We’re one of those miracle couples who try and try and try, and one day when they give up, it magically happens for them! Oh my God, that’s US now! What about the 5k I’m running in June? Who cares! What about our Japan trip in July? Fuck all the plans! Fuck them all, because I’M PREGNANT and I didn’t even plan to be! 

But… I remind myself to stay a little cautious I’ve been burnt before (and soooo many times). But then again…I think to myself “37 days? That would just be a cruel fucking joke.”

Today is day 38. I get up in the morning and wipe before peeing. Still nothing! Woo hoo! 

I take a pregnancy test, set the test in the sink, finish peeing. 

I wipe. Spotting. 

I wipe again. Heavier spotting. I’m definitely getting my period. 

AFTERIPEEONTHESTICKAREYOUFUCKKINGKIDDINGME!!!!!!

Also, the test was negative.

I’m not any more disappointed about “not being pregnant” than I have been in the past. What I’m REALLY (no… REALLY REALLY) angry about is that I allowed myself to be TRICKED. AGAIN. My body has just played this cruel joke on me, when I decided last month I was not going to think about fertility stuff all summer. Is it too much to ask to get your period on day 34 or 35 WHEN YOU EXPECT IT? I mean, come on! 

I feel so stupid and deceived. What’s worse is that (against my better judgment) I got my husband involved and I know he was getting excited, too. I think that’s the worst part… that my excitement started to convince him it was really happening.

So, today, I’m ""letting all go"" again. And I’m not looking back until September. I’m starting yoga on Tuesday, I’m running my 5k in June, and we’re going to Japan in July.

And no matter how many times my body calls, asking me to give it one more chance, “just believe me, baby! I’ve changed!” I won’t fall for it again. 

I’m so done.

Here's a review and links to it for iOS and Android: http://vitals.lifehacker.com/dosecast-wrangles-your-complicated-medication-schedule-1689407566

You put in the schedule you're taking drugs on (""at these times"" or ""every x hours"" or ""as needed at most every y hours"") and set up how it will remind you. 

When the clinic puts me on doses that fluctuate over the course of the cycle, this is great because I can set all the changes ahead of time. Half a pill twice a day from this day to that day, then a whole pill three times a day until day whatever, then two pills three times a day until whenever. 

You can have two reminders in case you ignore or miss the first one (or forget to mark your dose as taken). You can mark your dose as taken early so it won't ring, and you can manually enter when you took a dose if you didn't have your phone handy to mark it when you did. 

You can ""archive"" drugs so that they stop reminding you but you don't have to reenter them another time. 

The free features are enough to get by for all the protocols I've been on. Sure, I can't select ""injection"" and everything has to be in pills, but there's a notes section for each drug where you could clarify that if necessary (but really, if it says ""progesterone in oil"" I know 50 pills really means 50mg). 

My friend who broke her ankle found this really useful too, so it might be worth passing along. 

Normally I would buy the full version just to say thank you for the awesome free version, except that this works on a really pricey subscription service. I will probably sign up once then cancel to throw them some love.

Here&#39;s a review and links to it for iOS and Android: <a href=""http://vitals.lifehacker.com/dosecast-wrangles-your-complicated-medication-schedule-1689407566"">http://vitals.lifehacker.com/dosecast-wrangles-your-complicated-medication-schedule-1689407566</a></p>

<p>You put in the schedule you&#39;re taking drugs on (&quot;at these times&quot; or &quot;every x hours&quot; or &quot;as needed at most every y hours&quot;) and set up how it will remind you. </p>

<p>When the clinic puts me on doses that fluctuate over the course of the cycle, this is great because I can set all the changes ahead of time. Half a pill twice a day from this day to that day, then a whole pill three times a day until day whatever, then two pills three times a day until whenever. </p>

<p>You can have two reminders in case you ignore or miss the first one (or forget to mark your dose as taken). You can mark your dose as taken early so it won&#39;t ring, and you can manually enter when you took a dose if you didn&#39;t have your phone handy to mark it when you did. </p>

<p>You can &quot;archive&quot; drugs so that they stop reminding you but you don&#39;t have to reenter them another time. </p>

<p>The free features are enough to get by for all the protocols I&#39;ve been on. Sure, I can&#39;t select &quot;injection&quot; and everything has to be in pills, but there&#39;s a notes section for each drug where you could clarify that if necessary (but really, if it says &quot;progesterone in oil&quot; I know 50 pills really means 50mg). </p>

<p>My friend who broke her ankle found this really useful too, so it might be worth passing along. </p>

<p>Normally I would buy the full version just to say thank you for the awesome free version, except that this works on a really pricey subscription service. I will probably sign up once then cancel to throw them some love. </p>

We've been TTC for 2 years now. I have PCOS (but my fertility doc is calling this unexplained infertility because my hormones look good so she doesn't think the issue is really the PCOS), insulin resistance, hypothyroid (treated) and MTHFR A1298C homozygous. My husband has some slight issues (I think his morphology was a little off, but nothing major and he's taking Clomid for low testosterone, which is working).


So the plan for this cycle was to try Femara 5mg days 3-7 and then IUI. However, they couldn't see a mature follicle on ultrasound (my ovaries like to hide so the doc thinks they just couldn't see it), so we didn't do an IUI this cycle despite my LH (9) and E2 (118) being elevated. I had a progesterone level drawn and it indicated ovulation (it was 15, doctor thinks I ovulated around day 15 or 16). Hubby and I did have sex once that week (we were counting on the IUI, so we didn't put much effort into sex) on cycle day 14. 


I took a few HPT tests. Thought I saw a super light line on one of them (I think that was 12 dpo, but not sure) but a digital test the next day was negative, and the other HPTs were negative. Saw the doctor yesterday to talk about my next cycle and had an HCG and progesterone level drawn. Got the results this afternoon. HCG was 2.7 and progesterone was .85. The nurse said they consider over 2 positive for the HCG, but most places say over 5 is positive. Today was cycle day 31. My cycles the last few months have been short (they were around 30-45 days several months ago), like 24-26 days. The nurse said unless my period started, I needed to come back in on Monday to check the HCG level again to see if this was a ""false positive"". About 2 hours after talking to her, my period started. So now I'm wondering if this is a chemical pregnancy. I didn't think to ask her while on the phone. I will ask tomorrow but thought I would post here in the meantime.

Which is very rare for us. I had my HSG yesterday and it was bad. Fully blocked right tube, mostly blocked left. So that sucks and also explains a lot. I cried when we found out and he did too, and he handled it well afterward, and was really trying to be positive and optimistic about a likely IVF. 

But then I had to go out and get an antibiotic, which took a couple hours because of a mix up and while I was gone he called his mom about an unrelated health issue of his own, and of course she asked about the HSG, so he got upset because he's feeling inadequate because he can't just whip out his checkbook and plunk down the 15K for IVF, and he told her all about my blocked tubes.  Now, I had assumed we would share the results with her at some point soon, as we've been pretty open with her about the process so far.  But damn. I wasn't even home yet, I was still running around chasing down the antibiotic, all cramps and fucking devastated that my tubes are pretty much out for the count.  I had not had a moment to sit down and process the news. So I wasn't ready to share it with anyone yet.

So that said, I totally get how it happened.  I know he wasn't trying to be hurtful or disrespectful of my feelings.  So when he told me, I was upset that he shared the news, that it was no longer just known only by the two of us, but I wasn't mad at him.  I was disappointed and, illogically or not, embarrassed, but not mad.  When I said, ""Your mom knows?"", he said something like, ""Sorry but she asked..."" and a further explanation of their conversation.  I said - calmly - something like, ""I understand, but I wish you wouldn't have done that."" And then he just got super defensive, like how could I not immediately just be completely fine that she knows already, and we ended up ending the conversation as I was still waiting for my antibiotic. (Finally got to sit down around 9pm after my 1pm HSG, ugh!)

So I hadn't thought that much more about it as I'm pretty preoccupied with my shitty tubes, but he brought it back up today and I stayed calm for a good while but I finally lost my temper when it became clear that nothing I said was going to be acceptable except that it was fine that he told her and I had no problem with his timing.  Which would be untrue.  I wish he had waited. I do. I know he needed to talk and share his feelings with someone, and I get that, but yeah, I wish that in this case he had put me ahead of himself and at least asked me before calling, because of course she was going to ask about the HSG.  

But he didn't, and I know he wasn't hurting me intentionally, and I know he loves me, and it's over and can't be undone.  I just wish he would validate my feelings as I feel I've validated his instead of telling me I resent his relationship with his mother and that I'm holding him to a double standard. I love his mom and I totally get the need to talk about this stuff.  I just wish he had waited to call her and that he understood why I feel that way.

Thanks for listening.  I don't have anyone that I feel like I can share this kind of thing with, and it helps to write it down, even if I'm missing a bunch of details because I'm typing this on my kindle.

Doctor says I should do another test before I start to get worried, but wife has already been told by her gynecologist that she has no fertility related issues, and considering it's been a year since we stopped using condoms, I think I know what the outcome of the second test will be.

Needless to say, the news has dealt a severe blow to my self esteem, and it is taking all I can do not to let myself fall into a spiral of self pity, depression and misanthropy, especially since the rest of the whole world appears to have decided to actively and deliberately do all it can to constantly present me with stories, pictures and mentions of babies, happy parenthood and anything baby-related (for example, just over an hour ago, I was looking at some sports news, and out of nowhere, in the middle of an interview and completely unrelated to the subject at hand, this football player decides to take the time to announce to the world what an amazing and life-changing event the recent birth of his first daughter has been...).

Anyway, I have obviously been reading lots on the subject of semen quality, and I have found a couple articles (as in, peer-reviewed articles: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12568837, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355991) that point towards a positive correlation between L-Carnitine intake and  semen quality. Now, a quick glance at the Carnitine page on wikipedia revealed that if one is serious about increasing his intake of L-Carnitine, red meat is the only viable solution (either that, or eat about 20 lb of chicken every day). However, red meat is also listed as a food to avoid at all costs for men with fertility problems in just about every (non peer-reviewed) article I have read on the subject of food and male fertility.

So, should I eat red meat? Should I just order some L-Carnitin tablets on Amazon and stay away from steaks and hamburgers? Most importantly: am I just grasping at straws?

<p>Needless to say, the news has dealt a severe blow to my self esteem, and it is taking all I can do not to let myself fall into a spiral of self pity, depression and misanthropy, especially since the rest of the whole world appears to have decided to actively and deliberately do all it can to constantly present me with stories, pictures and mentions of babies, happy parenthood and anything baby-related (for example, just over an hour ago, I was looking at some sports news, and out of nowhere, in the middle of an interview and completely unrelated to the subject at hand, this football player decides to take the time to announce to the world what an amazing and life-changing event the recent birth of his first daughter has been...).</p>

<p>Anyway, I have obviously been reading lots on the subject of semen quality, and I have found a couple articles (as in, peer-reviewed articles: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12568837"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12568837</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355991"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355991</a>) that point towards a positive correlation between L-Carnitine intake and  semen quality. Now, a quick glance at the Carnitine page on wikipedia revealed that if one is serious about increasing his intake of L-Carnitine, red meat is the only viable solution (either that, or eat about 20 lb of chicken every day). However, red meat is also listed as a food to avoid at all costs for men with fertility problems in just about every (non peer-reviewed) article I have read on the subject of food and male fertility.</p>

<p>So, should I eat red meat? Should I just order some L-Carnitin tablets on Amazon and stay away from steaks and hamburgers? Most importantly: am I just grasping at straws?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

He walked in the office and told me with a sad look on his face (which I completely ignored because I became instantly enraged) that there was a ""technical error"". Needless to say, I fucking lost it - like really lost it. I ignored him the whole morning thinking to myself ""How the fuck do you miss!? WTF!!! explicative, explicative"". Well, he left for work and I wrote him a horrendous letter about how much shit I have had to go through, and why can't he just do this one thing - blah blah blah. I then apologized half-assedly about the outburst and just said basically said whatever - I'm done, I'm going back on birth control. Well, that was not the best and logical way to deal with our situation and he came back with an understanding remark about not wanting to see me and based on my reaction and not wanting to expand our family because of it.

Well, I had some errands to run while I cooled off from our worst fight yet-to-date. I actually had to get my 8DPO progesterone labs done, so I went to do that. During the drive there he called but I couldn't answer since I was in process of distributing my blood into vials. I called him back and I apologized for acting like a total asshat, that my outburst was completely unecessary, and he apologized too - for not trying to sabotage the whole ordeal. He said he's never jerked off in a cup before, had no idea what the best way to go about it would be... And so it dawned on me that I've never asked him about it, we've never really discussed jerking off into a cup, except for me volunteering to drop it off for analysis. 

So, the point to this wall of text is - does anyone have ANY advice to give us that can help ease the ordeal? I never imagined in my wildest dreams that it could be this hard for a guy, but apparently it is. I just want to help my husband any way I can. He's truly amazing, well beyond amazing, and I've been such a bitch to him lately, that I want to help any way I can. For starters, I will keep my emotions in check (ffs). 

tl;dr: husband tried to jerk off into a cup (his very first time ever) for his SA and completely missed the target. I went into full werewolf rage and lost my cool all over him; apologized, and now looking for ways to help him be better about it the next time.

I then apologized half-assedly about the outburst and just said basically said whatever - I&#39;m done, I&#39;m going back on birth control. Well, that was not the best and logical way to deal with our situation and he came back with an understanding remark about not wanting to see me and based on my reaction and not wanting to expand our family because of it.</p>

<p>Well, I had some errands to run while I cooled off from our worst fight yet-to-date. I actually had to get my 8DPO progesterone labs done, so I went to do that. During the drive there he called but I couldn&#39;t answer since I was in process of distributing my blood into vials. I called him back and I apologized for acting like a total asshat, that my outburst was completely unecessary, and he apologized too - for not trying to sabotage the whole ordeal. He said he&#39;s never jerked off in a cup before, had no idea what the best way to go about it would be... And so it dawned on me that I&#39;ve never asked him about it, we&#39;ve never really discussed jerking off into a cup, except for me volunteering to drop it off for analysis. </p>

<p>So, the point to this wall of text is - does anyone have ANY advice to give us that can help ease the ordeal? I never imagined in my wildest dreams that it could be this hard for a guy, but apparently it is. I just want to help my husband any way I can. He&#39;s truly amazing, well beyond amazing, and I&#39;ve been such a bitch to him lately, that I want to help any way I can. For starters, I will keep my emotions in check (ffs). </p>

<p>tl;dr: husband tried to jerk off into a cup (his very first time ever) for his SA and completely missed the target. I went into full werewolf rage and lost my cool all over him; apologized, and now looking for ways to help him be better about it the next time.</p>

If an average woman has a 28 day period, that's about 13 periods a year.  Mine is a little bit irregular, but close to about 23 days (I ovulate really early) which is nearly 16 periods a year.  (15.8)  So, that's about 2.8 more a year than average.

I turn 38 slightly more than a month, and I started when I was 14, so that's 24 years, give or take a few months.

24 years x 2.8 = 67.2 more periods than an average woman, or about 5.16 years.  Let's call it 5 for simple numbers. 

38 plus 5 years is 43.  I've had about as many periods as an average 43 year old woman.

My friend wanted to confide something great in me, and that was fine in the abstract, but got too much to hear just how many more times a day she and her husband are having sex. So I tell her I'm not the right person to talk to about this and I think that's the worst feeling. I say ""But I'm glad you are doing good.""

I was wrong. The worst feeling was when she said ""That's the only thing going well.""

I don't know what but something snapped in my head. Everyone can have problems no matter how good everything else is, but I am just not able to hear her problems right now. It could be serious. Her mom could be dying. Her kids could be horribly sick. But I am just too weak to be a good friend right now. There's a bit of spite about the things that are good too, which is even worse, since I know as well as anyone that doesn't cancel out the bad. 

I don't even know what's wrong because I closed the chat client and now I'm hiding. 

Maybe I'm upset because a couple months ago I steeled myself and offered them some help when I decided I had to say something about their kids' behaviour, and they were like ""We have no idea what you're talking about; we are totally fine with our family dynamic."" So maybe I'm just worried today's complaint falls into that bucket, and I'm pre-emptively annoyed because I offered help when I was up for it and they didn't even know they need help. (I know it sounds like I should just trust that they don't help, but it's confusing because they talk about behaviours that bother them (""I can't remember the last time I ate my dinner before it was stone-cold""), and then they turn around and say ""everything's fine here"".)

I just straight-up ran away from a conversation because I&#39;m not feeling strong enough and I&#39;m feeling bitter. </p>

<p>My friend wanted to confide something great in me, and that was fine in the abstract, but got too much to hear just how many more times a day she and her husband are having sex. So I tell her I&#39;m not the right person to talk to about this and I think that&#39;s the worst feeling. I say &quot;But I&#39;m glad you are doing good.&quot;</p>

<p>I was wrong. The worst feeling was when she said &quot;That&#39;s the only thing going well.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what but something snapped in my head. Everyone can have problems no matter how good everything else is, but I am just not able to hear her problems right now. It could be serious. Her mom could be dying. Her kids could be horribly sick. But I am just too weak to be a good friend right now. There&#39;s a bit of spite about the things that are good too, which is even worse, since I know as well as anyone that doesn&#39;t cancel out the bad. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s wrong because I closed the chat client and now I&#39;m hiding. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m upset because a couple months ago I steeled myself and offered them some help when I decided I had to say something about their kids&#39; behaviour, and they were like &quot;We have no idea what you&#39;re talking about; we are totally fine with our family dynamic.&quot; So maybe I&#39;m just worried today&#39;s complaint falls into that bucket, and I&#39;m pre-emptively annoyed because I offered help when I was up for it and they didn&#39;t even know they need help.

They want to thaw and rebiopsy the inconclusive one so they can try again to do the genetics screening, but since we're doing another cycle, I'm asking if we can just wait until we send off the next batch and rebiopsy it then if it survives the thaw. But if we get results from the second biopsy, I'm not expecting it to be good news, because if they couldn't amplify the DNA the first time, doesn't it mean it's more likely to be abnormal too?
