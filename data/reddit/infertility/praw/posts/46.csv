I've known since I was 16 that I have PCOS. I did everything in my power to help the symptoms. I kept a normal BMI, did Keto, took fertility supplements, all that jazz. My husband and I began trying for a baby in 2014. Since the doctors knew I had PCOS they immediately started me on Clomid. I got pregnant my first try. But unfortunately it ended in ectopic at 6 weeks and they ended up removing my left tube.

So I went for an hsg test, only to find out that my right tube was completely blocked as well. Fan-fucking-tastic. 

So the doctors said the only way I'd ever get pregnant was through IVF. I had tricare at the time but they covered nothing. So I spent $15,000 and we ended up getting 5 blastocysts, and the doctor implanted one embryo. 

Everything was going great and I was finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I really thought I was going to have the baby I dreamed about for all those years.

At our 17 week ultrasound the doctors said he had a severe hernia on his diaphragm and it was pushing his liver into his chest cavity and was causing his lungs to be underdeveloped. But they told us not to give up hope because they thought the pediatric surgeons could fix it. But at 21 weeks I got a call from the genetics counselor saying the he had Noonans syndrome, a genetic mutation and a slim chance at survival. 

We had to terminate at 23 weeks.

So it wasn't the PCOS or my blocked tubes. It was a fucking genetic mutation which they said was so rare that they hardly ever see it. I feel like a complete failure.

OK, so first, DH and I were 100% going to do PGS testing, but during our meeting, he switched sides and thinks we don't need it, because our RE said our blasts will likely be 80% normal.  She said that it costs $4500 for testing of up to 8 embryos, but then our estimate sheet says testing is ""$5000  (1/2 of which is paid by patient to reprogenetics)"" and then further down the page it says, under exclusions to package ""Reprogenetics DNA testing fee of $2500- paid directly by patient""  I don't want to waste time transferring something that will miscarry, and I'm really in a huge hurry personally, so I just don't know.  I'd rather husband just be on the same page because then I second guess myself.  The RE recommends waiting a month before transfer, which sucks but I know it's for the best.  It means either the best or worst Christmas news.  



Next, I didn't think of this until later, but does the price of IVF NOT include at least one transfer?  I guess I just always assumed IVF included the start to finish process, at least once!  I was looking at the price differences of their package and couldn't see how the package was cost beneficial until I realized that the price for IVF doesn't include a transfer!  What the damn hell?  So the cost of one round of IVF+ plus one transfer = $17k, and the price of of the package with 3 transfers is $19k.  Plus meds. 



Lastly, has anyone heard of Win Fertility?  They kept talking about going through Win for a financial package, but it looks like I need to call them to get more info/pricing, and I don't feel like I have quite enough info yet to talk to them.  


I'm also worried about needing some ""fat clothes"" for the expected bloating.  And I'm bitter because my husband will be out of town for a work conference that he can't miss right in the middle of my stims, a trip I was planning on going on BUT I had to use most of my PTO for my surgery, and while I could still go, I don't know if I'll need more time off this year in case I get sick, or will I need more than one day off for ER?  Can I travel with needles?  Will I just be miserable traveling and should not even bother?  I'm just feeling so freaking overwhelmed and bummed out about life right now guys.  It's all just hitting me hard.  I've been having a really hard time finding a therapist who's taking new patients too.  UGHUS@7826734HDG*&LIEBSRYGERUWEGRW#GER*&Q#RTG^&#IRTQ&@^#$T!!!!!!!  I did work out for the first time in five weeks though, so I'm hoping that helps me feel better. 


For anyone who's interested in the pricing for IVF in Seattle, our quotes are $13,325 for one cycle of IVF, $4000 for a FET, and $19,550 (before medication or PGS)

So I have finally decided after being a longtime lurker that I will make a account for infertility since a few my IRL friends know my main account.

So just for the context of my infertility, me and my husband have been trying for almost 2 years (unexplained) and we are currently doing IVF, after 3 IUIs w/ 2 mmc. 

Anyways, One of my friends has finally unveiled her 6 week old baby boy, born via surrogacy. And honestly I am just so jealous and annoyed, and because of that I feel even more annoyed for feeling that way :( . My friend is not even infertile but she used a surrogate for anxiety and career reasons. I support her fully, even though I ( and a lot of you guys) would kill to carry a baby I can see the other side. Plus, she is an amazing mother to 3 other young kids (2 stepkids and 1 adopted), I know the baby is in great care. I think the thing that gets to me the most are the finances. Both her and her partner are high payed speciality doctors that live in an amazing condo, send their kids to an 45k a year “prep” school, go on lavish month long vacations to europe, have nannies galore and I know it wouldn’t put a damper on their wallet to shell out 50-100k on RENT-A-FUCKING-WOMB. That led me to re-recognize something: THAT BEING INFERTILE IS SOOOO FUCKING EXPENSIVE.


And I can’t help but feel so jealous and a little bit of resentment. Like I said I support her decision to not carry, just because I would love to carry and have my body destroyed doesn’t mean she should for the sake of people with infertility, sorta like how people with infertility don’t owe it to the world to adopt. And at the same time I *DO* feel mad at her for not doing it the “natural” way, ugghh. I hate these feelings 


I guess I want to ask if anyone has any advice for feelings of jealousy of friends with kids or the ones who are expecting? Or the sometimes happy sometimes sad feelings? Thanks guys

RE says polyps can appear after doing multiple stim cycles from the hormone overload. Yay.

He put me on Metformin which he said should stop them from coming back. And said I should take it until I'm pregnant. I'm less than a week into another FET cycle now and started the metformin about 3 weeks ago.


A couple of questions for others on Metformin (I'm on  Extended Release):

-Does it make you very tired? Right now, I'm taking one pill at lunch and the other at dinner. I'm having issues in the afternoons with energy levels. Of course right now I'm on estrogen too so that probably doesn't help. But I'm wondering if it's extended release if I should just take the full dose at night? or in the morning? Anyone figure out a ""better"" time to take it? 


-He heavily stressed I needed to take it within 20 minutes of food - does this actually matter with the extended release?

After asking so many awesome people on here what their HGH cycle was like, I was convinced I needed to find Omnitrope over Saizen due to the cost. I live in Canada and there is no such thing as online pharmacies here for meds.

My first stop was at a Costco in one city where I gave them the DIN for omnitrope. She couldn't find the medication in their system at all. She was convinced I had the wrong number. I'm convinced she wasn't putting the 0 at the front of the number. The only thing she could find was Humatropin which I've never heard of before for IVF. So fuck.

Next stop was to the only fertilty pharmacy in the city that stocks IVF meds. I asked for a quote.

* 5mg/1.5ml - **$860**

* 10mg/1.5ml - **$1640**

What in the ever loving fuck? So much anxiety was caused from this pricing. My mind was working full time trying to find an alternative way to source HGH since the incompetent woman at Costco couldn't find it. 

The pricing I was given on here was more like $200 and $350 respectively. The gouging was extreme and honestly pissed me off. This med will be completely OOP since it's off label use.

At this point, I contacted /u/benihanacumberbatch (I totally owe you) and she gave me the info to try Costco again and some other options if Costco fell through. I called them yesterday and for whatever reason were now able to find the med in their system.

* 5mg/1.5ml - **$175**

* 10mg/1.5ml x5 vials - **$1300 for ALL 5**

What a freaking difference. I'm so pissed off* that the fertility pharmacy that my clinic referred me to would have such insane pricing compared to Costco. I've heard other ladies who use my clinic complain about being told they basically have to go to the fertilty pharmacy but I'm going to politely tell them to fuck off. You can't make someone pay 5 times more for a medication because you have some kind of deal worked out with them. The reason the clinic gives is that they can tell you how to administer the meds properly. This isn't my first rodeo, pretty sure I can pull out the appropriate dose from a pre-mixed vial.

My original fertility clinic would only say this was bad luck and I didn't like how they could care less about having me have any more testing done and they always blew off my concerns about why this could be happening. The IUIs at that clinic were covered under public healthcare, so they were practically free for me, but they were ready to switch to IVF with me for reasons that were not clear (possibly money, since I'd be paying out-of-pocket for that) and I've been ready to try this already for months.

So due to already being a geriatric infertility patient, and already having made up my mind to give IVF a try, I requested a consultation with a new clinic since I'd be paying out-of-pocket anywhere.  I just had it today and was a little surprised that the doctor recommended to try yet more IUIs due to my high rate of success from them and the fact that I have no tubal problems. 

The good thing is that the doctor there also works at the only public recurrent miscarriage clinic in the country (which I cannot access until having 3 miscarriages and then being put on what's currently a 1 year or more wait list), and seemed to have a good understanding of these things and was one of the main reasons I chose to go to them.  She told me that IVF would make absolutely no difference vs. doing IUI as far as the miscarriage issue went.  I was originally thinking it could decrease the chances of that somewhat, just due to picking properly growing blastocysts, but I could be very wrong. She did recommend more testing, especially since my TSH inched up even further with my latest test (now 2.9), and I was thrilled to learn they offered a recurrent miscarriage blood test panel including karyotyping which only cost about $400 for myself and my husband combined, so we had blood taken right there already today. 

Other than checking those and medicating for something obvious if necessary, the only change in my treatment regime would be switching to injectables (for which she's the second doctor in this country who has told me they make no difference vs Clomid in terms of egg quality - anyone heard anything different?), mainly due to side effects I had with Clomid (and I would go crazy doing things exactly the same again), and they prescribed progesterone, which I didn't even get at my first clinic (although I have no reason to believe I have a problem there, still nice to have it taken out of the equation).  I would have to pay out-of-pocket for these IUIs because this clinic is fully private.  Main issue is I'm not sure what more I'm getting from this vs. continuing with my old clinic where I could also request injectables and maybe could demand progesterone, and everything would be free.  I think I can get at least 6 IUIs covered under public healthcare.  I went to this one because I was ready to switch to IVF!

Another issue is also that because I'm getting so old, I'm not sure I want to go crazy sitting through up to 3 more IUI cycles again to get pregnant, and then possibly lose it again.  I figured IVF could skyrocket my chance of it working the first time, considering I don't seem to have huge issues with conception and implantation in general. 

IUI, by the way costs, about $1k per cycle here and IVF is either $4-5k per cycle or about $6900 for a 3 IVF package. The drugs will end up being no more than another $300 or so for the rest of the year because I'll hit my maximum deductible under the public system quickly, and all drugs are still covered by it.  I have a lot in savings for this so this cost for IVF is hardly an issue - at my age, time is worth more to me than money. I can still always request IVF against her recommendation and they will gladly take my money.

I called on Friday to place my order, and the total price was higher than I remembered. I couldn't compare it against the price quote they'd previously sent, as our internet is still down.

I asked the rep to email me a list of the meds prior to shipping them. They were sending 30 vials of Menopur (rx called for 22) and 12 (!) Z-Paks (rx called for two). The discrepancy was surprising, as they'd previously emailed pricing info for the correct quantities. I responded and asked if they sell Menopur in single vials or multi-packs.

Just doing some research into this topic. My RE has told me that the sweet spot is 2-5 cycles in between egg retrieval and transfer. We will do a freeze-all as he prefers FET due to higher pregnancy rates, and I will likely be at high risk for OHSS. I, of course, want to push for FET as soon as it's safe/feasible but that's just because after 3 years, I'm impatient. I do agree with my RE though when he tells me the goal is to get pregnant, not necessarily quickly.

Most gals on my local IF FB group (that also go to my clinic) are reporting 3 months from ER to FET. I have found some studies and literature reviews indicating:

1) < 50 days from ER to FET had significantly higher clinical pregnancy rates (35% to 21%) compared to > 50 days (5-6 months on average)

2) no difference in live birth rate for FET performed in the first menstrual cycle after ER compared to subsequent cycles.

3) no significant difference in clinical pregnancy rate in the immediate transfer group (<22 days after ER) vs the delayed group (>22 days after ER) -- 32.5% vs 31.7%.

Can anyone share what their clinic tells them? Anyone have research or insight into this? Thanks in advance.

<p>Just doing some research into this topic. My RE has told me that the sweet spot is 2-5 cycles in between egg retrieval and transfer. We will do a freeze-all as he prefers FET due to higher pregnancy rates, and I will likely be at high risk for OHSS. I, of course, want to push for FET as soon as it&#39;s safe/feasible but that&#39;s just because after 3 years, I&#39;m impatient.

I have a lot of questions and would love a little extra moral support. Honestly IVF has consumed my waking thoughts. It's literally all I think about, read about, or even want to talk about. I don't want to be ""that friend"" and make every convo about my follicles and eggs, but this is the biggest thing I have ever done and I deal with it every day. I can't compartmentalize it. My friends and family are all super supportive but I still feel like I'm being obnoxious. So looking for some buddies I can check in with who can also help keep me in check!!

One of the things husband and I disagree on is to what level we are willing to allow ourselves to be hopeful. I feel as though we have spent so much time being negative and pissed/sad and now we have a new chance. It's a risky chance yes, but if I don't get excited or have dreams about this little one I'll still be devastated- so why not dream a little? I don't want to be overly positive or negative but I also want to give myself permission to feel excitement. Can anyone relate to this? How did you keep you emotions and thoughts in check? A healthy balance of cautious optimism is my goal here. 

This next thing is a little less abstract. One is since I started menopur on day 1 of my period I can't tell if the feeling I'm already experiencing in  my ovaries is from my period, the medication, or my own brain playing tricks on me. When did you start to feel something?

I was certain at first that I only wanted to try 1 to transfer. Now that this is reality I'm thinking that I might actually want to transfer 2 (if I'm lucky enough to have that option!). Im 36 and could stand to loose a few pounds but otherwise I'm in good health. Im just worried that we won't have another shot at this so I want to maximize our chances. On the other hand what if both stick? This would be my first pregnancy and I'm already scared enough as it is about how my body will respond! How did you make the decision to transfer one or more?

My last thought / ramble is about some members of my family and their religious beliefs. My aunt is VERY catholic. My husband, mom, and I purposely did not want to tell her about this because of her religious beliefs. Well my brother spilled the beans to her - and now she's sending my mom all of these articles about how the church is against this yada yada yada...did anyone else have crazy uber religious people in their fam who just didn't get it? How did you deal with that?

Sorry for the long rant / post. Also I have no idea how to tl;dr this. My brain is like a million miles an hour right now! I've found that smoking weed helps shut my brain up but I'm obviously scared to do that...so hoping that getting this out in the ether will help!

No? Well do you want kids?""

I'm in my early 30's and just found out I need to have a hysterectomy. I've been married for 10 years, but we never conceived (he has low sperm count due to radiation). Having a child was never a huge priority, so we never tried any kind of medical intervention. Now that I want to try, my chance is up.

Anyway, before I could always say, ""Oh, someday..."" Now, I don't know what to say. It feels like lying to act like I could still have children, but I don't want to be a buzzkill by announcing that I can't.

My husband had an un-descended testicle that wasn't operated on until he was around 7 years old. This was 30 years ago and they now know that this must be operated on before 12 months otherwise it causes infertility.

Anyway, he had a sperm analysis as we were trying to conceive. We had it done 3 months after we started trying as I wanted to check all our bases (I had a suspicion that the operation may have affected something).

Anyway, first and second analysis were bad. He was diagnosed with Severe OAT, basically minimal sperm (under 400k) and the sperm that weren't there couldn't swim and were badly shaped (0% morphology).

We were told that we would have to get IVF/ICSI and use a sperm donor. We weren't ready to use a sperm donor so our IVF center recommended us to their urologist.

The urologist put him on the following vitamins (we are both in good shape, eat healthy, don't smoke, less than 1 alcoholic drink a week and are active): 

* 1000mg vitamin C 

* 400mg vitamin E 

* 15mg zinc 

* 30mg CoQ10 

* 100iu selenium

* 3000mg omega 3 (that I added to our mix, urologist didn't recommend)

I also changed our diet so we consumed more foods that contained the above vitatmins, as well as eliminating artificial/white sugar (ie. I'll bake cakes using honey or banana as the sweetener instead of sugar).

We had our 3rd analysis today (after 3 months) and there were 1.6 million sperm and morphology had increased by 5%! The urologist has now also put him on Clomid but said he doesn't need to take it since we are going ahead with ICSI (of course he is going to take it because we are hoping for our FSB!!).

Even though we don't have enough sperm to conceive naturally, we now have enough sperm to go ahead with ICSI without having to use a donor.

I switched to a new clinic and I'm in a natural mock cycle to complete an ERA biopsy.  I had a positive OPK at home on Sunday night and the next afternoon (Monday afternoon) we saw one of three mature follicles had collapsed on ultrasound, suggesting I was ovulating. 

Right now my biopsy is scheduled for Friday afternoon. However, this is only 5 days after my LH surge (where initial positive is considered day 0) or 4 days after ovulation.  If we followed the Igenomix protocol listed on their website, the biopsy should be taken on Sunday (7 days after OPK / 5 days after ovulation). My RE still thinks Friday is the best course because this is when she would be doing a transfer in a natural FET cycle.

Because I am neurotic, I called Igenomix support in Spain and they agreed the biopsy should be done on Sunday. However, my RE does a number of ERAs and I don't want to be a little shit second-guessing her expertise.  What would you do?  Move the timing? Do two biopsies, one on Friday and one on Sunday?

So here's my delimma. My RE recommends that I do the lap while Im on BCP prepping for another egg retrieval cycle so we can bank more eggs while my reserves are still good. I'm 36. Then go to FETs after with a good supply of tested embryos.

My questions are
- I would ""save a month time"" if I do the lap while prepping for the egg retrieval, but would my endo come back between the lap and fet if I do an egg retrieval in the middle?
- if you had 3 embryos left, with 2 failures, would you do another retrieval now or wait till later if the next 1 or 2 fail? My RE is worried that if I get pregnant w my next 2 FETs, and we want another child, earliest I would be 38 and egg reserve would decrease.

I found this subreddit a few days ago after randomly searching reddit for ""effortless IVF"" in hopes of finding other people who were going through the same treatment in my city. Instead a found this shitty corner of the internet....and I'm glad I did. I also found there were many questions about INVOcell treatment seeing as it's a relatively new option, so I thought I would share my story up till now.

My Wife and I started doing the various test for infertility about 18 months ago. The first test was of course the SA and the results showed that I had no morphology or motility issues but a low count. At the time we were doing tests through the regional fertility program in my city (Calgary, Alberta). In the meeting where we were reviewed my SA they immediately said IVF is what we would need, after that was a whirlwind of paperwork, brochures, and lab requisitions all ending with asking for a deposit and a credit card number. We left the office in shock, cried in the car and headed to the mall for retail therapy (that same weekend we also bought tickets for Hamilton in New York, went the show in February it was amazing but I digress).

About a month later a friend who has also struggled with infertility told us about something called Effortless IVF she saw on the website Kickstarter. We checked it out and at the time they were offering this new type of IVF, less drugs, less doctor's visits for $4000 (CAD). This was an attractive option as traditional IVF would have run us $20000-$25000. 

It was a long wait for the clinic to build an office, hire staff and get all the required accreditation and legal stuff done but we were ready for that. 

Fast forward to today and we are at 13 days of Lupron and 5 days of Menopur. we did a baseline sonogram 5 days ago and that showed 9 follicles. We go in for another Ultrasound on Sept 4th to see the size of the follicles and may do the HCG trigger. If we do, then egg retrieval would be the Sept 6th and egg and sperm are transferred to the INVOcell. The INVOcell is then placed in my Wife for five days and I believe there is a Progesterone IM injection for these five days and oral medications as well. After those 5 days the embryo will be transferred to her uterus and then we hope for the best.  

That's where we are today. My wife is feeling sore and bloated, I am doing my best at being a good nurse. I'm happy to answer any questions or better yet would love to hear if anyone else has gone through or is waiting for INVOcell treatment.

129,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey all.

Thought I'd post a quick thing with an easily searchable title so that if others are about to see a Registered Psychologist they could learn a little bit about how the visit went for me, and what they might expect. So much of the shitty-ness of this whole process is the unknown, the unexpected. If I can help clarify and demystify something, it seems like it can only help.

Today, I met with a Registered Psychologist. This is someone who has a university degree, and is registered with a board. 
The Psychologist I met with specializes in reproductive health concerns ei: folks like me. I was referred to see her by the RE. This was with my permission and at the request of my partner, who (like me) has a positive view of Cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness and the efficacy of psychiatric services. 

It took me 3 weeks to get an appointment to see her, which in Canada land, and in my specific community is pretty reasonable. (Your mileage may vary depending on community, country, availability... etc etc) The price was high, but fortunately covered by my (not that comprehensive if we are being totally honest) benefits at work. 

My first meeting with her was pretty much a meet and greet, but I did find it helpful. We started off with the usual important things (Are you a Ben, a Benny, a Benjamin? :P) and then worked towards drawing the big picture of who I am and why I was there. She let me introduce myself, and interjected questions when she felt she needed to. Some examples of this, as I spoke of my husband she asked what about us and our relationship really made us work. That was kind of fun to explain, as it's not a typical question and it's basically asking me to talk about my favourite person. :P

I detailed my fertility journey to her, talked about my miscarriages, the care I'd received, not received. I talked about how it made me feel and how it left me feeling now, 7 months out from the last loss with no new success in sight. 
(Again she'd ask questions, we had the odd little tangent here and there, but for the most part she and I both were focused on getting the Who, what, where, when, why, and hows of me stated.) I didn't feel awkward telling her all this stuff. It felt a lot like posting stuff to you all here - just stating how it was and how I joined this community.
I was pretty frank at times - I flat out told her that I felt like the TTC journey was going to result in madness, because it's just all consuming and so totally destructive to one's mental health, self image, all that.

What I really liked is after I'd told her about me, my experiences, she talked. I was expecting it to be mainly corrections, things I could improve on, do better with. That she'd tell me that TTC was a lovely and wonderful thing and that I was crazy for thinking it wasn't all fun and roses. NOT SO!

She started off with praise for some of the things I've done in recent months. Examples being, setting boundaries with friends. (I feel like you all deserve some of the praise here, as many of you have given me such wonderful advice, suggestions and anecdotes) She said that setting these boundaries was important and was not a cowardly thing to do. I've had my doubts on this, as I always had a ""Cow girls don't cry, when you fall get up again"" attitude. (despite being neither a cowgirl or a very good horseback rider). Hearing her tell me that it was totally okay to not want to discuss pregnancy with my friends was a bit of an epiphany and a relief. I guess I am being smart when I avoid a babyshower!

She also discussed how important it is to stay focused on other aspects of life. Whether this was work, family, social life, hobbies, church. The goal is not to be 100% focused on pregnancy, fertility. This wasn't news, but it was good to hear it again. 

Last but not least, and I think one of the thing I needed to hear most, was about lifestyle and ttc. For the record I'm a bit chubby, but not by a whole lot. My diet is reasonably healthy - I'm a combination vegetarian/locavore. (AKA - If you offer me the chance to buy local eggs from a happy farm I'll buy them, but I won't order meat at a restaurant where the ethical details aren't known) I play sports at least once a week and spend a fair amount of time outside between my garden, my dogs, yardwork. So I'm a reasonably healthy person. But I've had nagging fears that some aspect of my lifestyle is preventing me from getting pregnant again. Or from staying pregnant. As smart as I am, as much as I can read scientific papers, I still needed to hear from her that nothing I'm doing is causing my miscarriages, my not pregnant-ness. 

I will see her again in a month or so, because I think that she very well might make this tough and unpleasant journey just a little bit less terrifying and frustrating. 

 If anyone has questions or things I should detail a bit more, I will gladly do so.

There are less than 100 true endo specialists who only treat people with this disease; that's why so many women go an average of 10 years before being diagnosed (it often happens during the process of finding out why pregnancy doesn't happen) and most of these surgeries have to happen out of network because the gynecology standards haven't caught up with the techniques being used. So many women go through multiple failed surgeries where the endo is only burned off (ablation) only to discover a year later that they have to go back into surgery again and again. Many doctors still recommend hysterectomies to women suffering from this disease though it doesn't help at all resolve the underlying issues.

My first failed FET resulted in a chemical, second was a negative - found out this week. Both embryos were PGS tested, good grades, hatched blasts. Lining supposedly perfect, at 12mm and 14mm. I was willing to chalk up the first chemical to bad luck, maybe chromosome issues, but now with the second failure, I feel strongly that something else is going on. I had a slightly elevated prolactin for my second FET, 36- was on parodel. 

I have a history of painful periods, need several doses of Advil to get through day 1,2 of my periods. Suspect Endo, but haven't had the guts to go through w a lap.. yet.  Thanks to the lovely folks on this forum, I discovered BCL6 and receptivadx testing. Unfortunately my RE refuses to do this test and has referred me to do a lap instead, which for some reason I'm  absolutely terrified of. My RE wants me to do a lap, and depending on severity of the endo discovered, put me on 2-3 months of Depot Lupron before my next FET, but he seems to be okay if I don't do it and just go for another FET as well. My RE doesn't seem willing to put me on 1-2 months of Depot Lupron (for suspecting endo) unless he has confirmaition of endo from a lap.. I have 2 blasts left. 

So my questions are: 

1. My period pain is severe, and heavy! Pain lasts for ~ 2 days out of 4 total days of bleed. Do you think I should test for endo after two failed FETS? 

2. If yes, would you do the lap, or try to find a doc in the area that would run the bcl6 biopsy? And then if bcl6 shows high, try to convince my RE to put me on Depot Lupron? I hear horror stories of this, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

My RE doesn&#39;t seem willing to put me on 1-2 months of Depot Lupron (for suspecting endo) unless he has confirmaition of endo from a lap.. I have 2 blasts left. </p>

<p>So my questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>My period pain is severe, and heavy! Pain lasts for ~ 2 days out of 4 total days of bleed. Do you think I should test for endo after two failed FETS? </p></li>
<li><p>If yes, would you do the lap, or try to find a doc in the area that would run the bcl6 biopsy? And then if bcl6 shows high, try to convince my RE to put me on Depot Lupron? I hear horror stories of this, but I&#39;ll cross that bridge when I get there.</p></li>

I've always had fine, thin, baby hair, since I was little. In my 20s it started to thin out a little more, but nothing too bad.

Our first PGS attempt, prompted by a chemical pregnancy, failed due to the third party lab's ""equipment failure"" - they lost our biopsied cells. Another miscarriage later (we just got confirmation that the reason for our second mc was a chromosomal abnormality), we now want to attempt PGS of the remaining frozens again, but with a different lab. Our RE has no data on whether this could be successful or ruin our frozens for future transfer. FYI, our frozens had a 100% survival rate after the first biopsy.

The PA told me the ultrasound looked like it confirmed I ovulated - follicle on the left went from 21 to 18 and was likely a shadow, and all the follicles on my right were 13mm or less (last week the biggest were 19 and 16). So she had me do blood work to check my progesterone to confirm.

Welp, it's official, my body is trolling me this cycle. The PA called yesterday afternoon to say the blood work results showed that I was ""in the process of ovulating but I hadn't ovulated yet"". WTF body??? 

I don't understand why my follicles would be shrinking if I am about to ovulate.

I recently submitted a memo to my employer asking for an expansion of benefits to cover infertility treatment (as I live in MI, one of the shit states that doesn't mandate coverage). Just met with the big boss; they won't be expanding coverage through our insurance policy (we're too small of an org, it's too expensive, bla bla...). HOWEVER, he ""wants to find a way to say yes,"" and thinks a one-time cash benefit could work.

His dilemma is how to make this ""fair"" to all staff. He says if they offer a benefit like this, it would either have to be available to everyone for a broad suite of purposes, or it would have to be carefully delineated for infertility or other medical purposes. His example was, what if someone wants a face lift? The sense I got from him was that people will say, ""starting a family is a choice that I'm not making, so what do I get instead?""

My initial thoughts: it makes me shake with anger that someone could compare a face lift to infertility, but that's not going to be a strong argument. I was thinking maybe requiring a medical diagnosis would be a good way to delineate the benefit, but I don't want it to exclude, for example, same-sex couples that want to adopt to build their families. Is the argument ""starting a family is a fundamental human right"" good enough? I suspect not. (I will note that we offer childcare subsidies - what are the childless employees getting in lieu of that?)

But... I need to get my BMI down to 35, so that's about 30kg (65lbs) I need to lose between now and January, it'll help with the pre-cancer prognosis too, and they gave me all my tests and pricing schedule stuff.

So fingers crossed for me!!!

I'm wondering if I didn't respond because they're expired or if it's just me...I'm calling tomorrow but has anyone ever used expired Menopur? Did it still work as well? Freaking out over this...

A close friend of mine just recently had a 3rd MC, within the last 2 IVF cycles. 
- The first transfer yielded only one 3-day embryo, which resulted in the MC at around 7 weeks. 
- The second transfer she had 3 embryos; the first 5-day one didn't catch on, the second went to 12 weeks (twins) and third again didn't progress pass the 7 weeks. The last one happened just recently.

Words can not describe how much love (and pain) I feel for this girl, we have been through so much together inside and outside of the IF world. (Travelling, volunteering, sporting events, we even have the same dogs ffs...)

We have both been on the IF journey for years and I just had a recent success. Does it make me no longer qualified to be her support person? I know she stopped being in touch with some of her friends when they got pregnant as sometimes, as we all know, in can be just too much. 

I absolutely understand if it's going to come to this, as nobody really needs any more reminders around them at this period of their life, but if anyone has any tips on how to be supportive without being annoying or triggering that would be very helpful.

Ten are U.S. pharmacies, and one is an Israeli pharmacy that a couple of people here have recommended. The prices are for self-pay patients without any insurance coverage. Some clarifications:

* Per my RE, Follitism & Gonal-F are interchangeable, as are Ganirelix & Cetrotide. Some pharmacies only provided pricing for one or the other.
* Menopur is often discounted with the purchase of FSH in the same order. I noted the non-discounted price when it was available.
* My doctor didn't include Endometrin on my IVF prescription, although it was on my IUI prescription. I was told that insurance *usually* covers it after IVF, even without ART coverage. I obtained prices on it at some pharmacies, anyway.

How I'm trying to cut costs:

* Gonal-F and Follitism come in different size vials/pens. It's my understanding that each of the sizes has about the same amount of overfill. I only priced the 900IU, per my original prescription, but I asked my RE to change my rx to 300IU pens so that I can use the overfill in each. [See this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5lpb0y/lpt_buy_gonalf_in_300iu_pens/) for more info.
* I'll order a lower quantity of Gonal-F/Follitism than prescribed, as I may not need to stim for that long. Because my pharmacy is local and ships overnight, and I have a backup local Walgreens that carries IF drugs, I feel comfortable doing this should I need more meds on short notice.
* EMD-Serono offers a [10% rebate](https://webrebate.trialcard.com/coupon/GoDirectPortal/) on Cetrotide, Gonal-F, and Ovidrel. As far as I know, its use is unlimited (I've already used it twice for IUI). A minimum price may apply. Per [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6mvdo2/emd_serano_compassionate_care_bs/), the min. seems to be $924 for Gonal-F 900IU pen and $104.50 for one Cetrotide. I'm not sure what the minimums are for the lower-dose pens or Ovidrel, but I received the refund when I paid $94.50 for the latter. I'll mail in my receipts, anyway - can't hurt.
* Without my asking, my nurse gave me the four estrogen patches I'll use prior to the cycle. They expire next month, and I assume they were leftovers donated by a patient. If money is tight, ask your RE or nurse if they have any donated meds they can provide.

Let me know if anything is unclear and if you have feedback or advice. For those who haven't seen it, here's a [mega pricing post](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/48axum/big_post_on_ivf_medication_pricing_and_information/) & spreadsheet from about a year ago.

UPDATE: Added Conception Pharmacy pricing. Also, RE changed my Rx from three 900IU pens (2700IU total) to four 300IU pens with 3 refills (2100IU total + overflow). The medical assistant suggested I order the four pens and then request refills, as needed. Even if I need all of the refills, this will save me over $500.

<p>Let me know if anything is unclear and if you have feedback or advice. For those who haven&#39;t seen it, here&#39;s a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/48axum/big_post_on_ivf_medication_pricing_and_information/"">mega pricing post</a> &amp; spreadsheet from about a year ago.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Added Conception Pharmacy pricing. Also, RE changed my Rx from three 900IU pens (2700IU total) to four 300IU pens with 3 refills (2100IU total + overflow). The medical assistant suggested I order the four pens and then request refills, as needed. Even if I need all of the refills, this will save me over $500.</p>

Full spoilers, if you feel like raging at a work of fiction:

- An infertile midwife pretends a baby is dead so she can keep it and raise it as her own. Yup. Baby stealing guys.
- Midwife never lets the kid goes outside - keeps her locked up. Evil step-mother style.
- Woman gets pregnant after one sexy time, after thinking she was infertile. Because when she was 17 she slept around intentionally trying to get pregnant and it never worked - they mention her being skinny and having infrequent periods.
- Her twin sister, who is infertile after losing a baby at 8 months, upon finding out sister (above) is pregnant with her husband's child, kills (perhaps an accident?!) her husband in a jealous rage. 
- Oh, also her original pregnancy was a one-time while losing her virginity baby. ""Magic sperm"". :|

So today is day 1 of my cycle. I also have my husband's grandmother visiting us and had his aunt over for lunch. It was hard, I sort of just want to crawl in a corner and cry. I did cry off and on while I cleaned the house all morning preparing for them to come over. I haven't had a chance to sit alone and process anything until now, the aunt has left, the husband is doing a little office work, and the grandmother is napping. 

I expected this to happen. It's been a good while since my period brought on the water works but I think this one is hitting me so hard because it means we're moving on to IVF. I'm nervous and scared and feeling the shame piling on with this change in treatment plan all while I know it's the best course of action and everything indicates we probably should have skipped ahead months ago. I feel like part of me considers IVF as a ""real"" infertility problem where as before I thought of it as we were having a little trouble conceiving and getting a little help. I know that's ridiculous thinking but you can't control your thoughts. Also probably a good dose of denial mixed in there. I know it's largely the same drugs and our problem hasn't changed any, but it makes me feel more defeated and more afraid that it will never happen for us. I'm anxious about the actual process of IVF, I hate being put out and get really tense thinking about it. I also know this is putting more strain on my husband who thinks it's his fault we need to move from IUI to IVF due to his SA and I feel guilty about THAT. 

I'm really glad I made the initial appointment with the IVF clinic I want to use before I needed it. I don't know if I could bring myself to make that phone call right now and am glad the ball is already rolling, which is exactly why I did it then so very well done me. 

At least I can open this bottle of wine and go out for sushi next week.

I wanted to compile the numbers for my clinic/area and also let other **veterans** that stumble upon this post know what they may pay with my clinic's discount applied. I also have some information on what exactly Tricare Standard will cover (which is insurance that all retired veterans have access to, but I'm not 100% sure if members who separated at the end of enlistment have access to Standard or Extra).


**INITIAL WORKUP**


$200 for genetic screening, *100% out-of-pocket since we were told Tricare doesn't cover this test*

$0 for ultrasounds, labs, and tests such as SHG and HSG *as long as they are not part of IUI or IVF cycle management* (**will update if Tricare sends bills**)


**IVF**


The ""Self-Pay (Base Price)"" is what you can expect to pay for these services at my clinic if you plan to pay for everything 100% out-of-pocket with no insurance being billed or stepping in to help with part of the cost. Notice that there is no discount for freezing embryos, and there is an **annual fee of $500** for storing frozen embryos.

We are not doing PGS/PGD this cycle, but my clinic charges **$2200 for embryo biopsy per cycle** (this price does not include PGS/PGD fees). So, if you will be freezing embryos and having genetic testing conducted on them, you will pay the $1200 cryopreservation fee + $2200 embryo biospy fee + $?? PGS/PGD testing fee. 


|    |Self-Pay (Base Price)|Veteran Price|
:--:|:--:|:--:|
**Cycle Monitoring (ultrasounds/labs)**|$300|$225|
**IVF+ICSI/Fresh Transfer**|$9050|$6788|
**IVF+ICSI/No Transfer**|$7050|$5288|
**Cryopreservation of Embryo(s)**|*$1200*|*$1200*|
**Frozen Embryo Transfer**|$2300|$1725|


**MEDICATIONS**


I applied for a discount through [EMD Serono](https://fertilitylifelines.com/how-to-save/compassionate-care-application/). However, the pharmacy that Fertility Centers of Illinois works with (Apothecary By Design, formerly known as ""Healy Pharmacy"") is partnered with EMD Serono and automatically tries to apply discounts for all patients who purchase medications through them. Tricare agreed to cover 80% of cost for the antibiotic (our co-pay $4.69), Pregnyl trigger shot (our co-pay $24), pain medication (our co-pay $1.18), Cetrotide to prevent ovulation (our co-pay $24), and 8 Minivelle Estradiol patches to wear during suppression instead of birth control pills (our co-pay $10.00). Tricare would not pay anything toward Gonal-F or Menopur. I can provide how much I paid for those two if people are interested. I was not charged for syringes, alcohol wipes, or the sharps container.

I will hopefully be transferring a frozen embryo after I have my tubes removed this fall, so I do not yet have an estimate for PIO (progesterone in oil) or other medications I may need to prepare for that.

If I have missed something important, let me know and I will update this post. I realize that this info is very specific to one clinic (although they have centers and doctors all over northern Illinois) and to a certain subset of our infertility community, but I hope it can help at least some of you that fit the criteria or are just curious.

I'm 35, BMI of 40, have polycystic ovaries, and a beard (but lack other symptoms of PCOS). I've never been pregnant before.  I ovulate regularly and have an AMH of 3.1.  RE recommends IUI with donor sperm.]

A couple weeks ago I saw my RE for office hysteroscopy and a sono-salpingogram (hope I spelled that correctly!). This is the normal diagnostic workup they do for everyone who walks in the door. I was diagnosed with a uterine polyp (sessile, partly blocking the opening of my right ovary). It was recommended I have said polyp removed via hysteroscopy.  Sure. Fine. 

My insurance pays for a little bit of infertility treatment (50% of the first $4000). I have about half of that left after the initial appointment and the diagnostic procedures.  The financial counselor at the clinic said that she thought it would be coded as medical (not infertility) and thus I would only have my regular copay. 

I got my period today and called the clinic to schedule the polypectomy. As usual, I left a message with the receptionist and was expecting a call back from the nurse to make the appointment. Instead I got a call back from the financial counselor that the procedure was coded as infertility treatment and that my out of pocket cost would be about $6000. (!). She recommended I message my PCP/NP and tell them about the polyp, not mention the infertility, and see what happens. She also said I can appeal the decision with my insurance. 

So I spent my busy day today considering the following options (in order of preference):

1. Keep the damn polyp and move forward with the IUI and see what happens. (Research says that polyps can hinder implantation, but the research isn't decisive.)

2. Appeal the decision with my insurance.  (Anyone have any tips?  I have decent insurance and am relatively healthy, so I've never had to deal with this before.)

3. Message my PCP and see if they can make a recommendation/referral.  (I did this, but haven't heard back yet.)

4. Make an appointment with an OB/GYN and see if they could remove the polyp as a medical treatment. 

6. Pay the $6000 and have it done. 

7.  Pretend that it's causing issues and see what happens. (In fairness, when my uterus/ovaries twinge, it is usually the side with the polyp.)

Thoughts? Experiences?

tl:dr - how'd you get your insurance to pay for a polypectomy?

I never have periods on my own and have PCOS - my doctor gave me oral progesterone pills to induce a cycle prior to the HSG. I finished the pills a few days ago, 3 questions:

1. Did anyone else have a mild, low grade fever after taking oral progesterone? Google says it's a known side effect but I'm curious if anyone here had that.

2. I've read every thread about HSGs and am so anxious but also aware that not everyone has a horrible experience. My normal doctor is out of town and I'll be having someone I've never met perform it - would appreciate some accounts of how this went.

3. Anyone else have absolutely no (or once every year+) periods when not prompted by the pill?

Also, hello. I've been following this sub since we began trying to conceive, and thought that now that I'm officially heading off to an RE it was time to say hi. I'm feeling a little lost, a little helpless, and a lot alone. Glad to find a community of others going through the same struggles.

Some background - TTC#1, 32, Husband 32 no sperm issues at all but our clinic uses ICSI anyway (also we are doing PGS and you have to use ICSI).  

Dx: Likely Lean/Mild PCOS - normal bloodwork except AMH was 5.2 (above average for my age but not through the roof) and irregular periods. I am slightly underweight, no acne or hirsutism.

Stimulated for 8 days on Gonal F (150 for i think 4 days) and then stepped down to 100 for the rest. I was also on Cetrotide to suppress ovulation until the trigger. I was triggered with Decapeptyl instead of HCG as it is supposed to virtually guarantee no OHSS. However, I had to come in the day after the trigger shot to make sure it worked (it did).

Will do freeze-all. I had at least 16 large follicles and another dozen smaller ones at the last u/s.

I did not like my egg retrieval process.  Clinic was running late so had to sit around for a good 30 mins being nervous and doing nothing.  When the nurse finally came, she struggled getting my IV in and got it in the wrong spot which hurt so much. After 2 more attempts she finally got it right.

In the OR, I got some fetanyl (so conscious sedation, not out completely), it was a good drug but near the end i wanted more as i could feel the pressure, like very strong cramps and a bit of poking. They also froze the vaginal wall. 

I think because i had a lot of eggs it took a bit longer and so the drugs wore off.  I did ask for more drugs but the Dr was like we are almost done, but goddamn him i would have been fine to have a little more. I was saying OW OW OW a lot near the end LOL. (I think partly its just knowing what is happening is the painful part).

Some of you may remember my totally shitty story about my biopsy day going to shit. Long story short, I was to get an ERA and ReceptivaDx biopsy to try to figure out if we were dealing with any extra undiagnosed issues before we lobbed my last 2 PGS tested embryos into the garbage chute that is my uterus. It did not go well, was very painful, and then I found out that neither lab could run the tests, they only got cervical tissue in the biopsy. 

So my doctor apologized like crazy. Told me to come in and they'd knock me out, do a mini-d&c to get the biopsies, look around with a scope for anything obvious and I'd be on my way. That happened 2 weeks ago.

A week ago, my worst fears about the biopsies were realized when the ReceptivaDX test showed I had endo, would need to go on Depot Lupron for 2 months and I'm terrified of the side effects of that. Compound that with the time lost and I'm just fucking pissed. I really did not think the tests would come back showing any issues because I have ENOUGH issues for it to be really tough to get pregnant.  So I was just not prepared for ANOTHER thing to go wrong and it made me so sad.

Which brings us to yesterday, when I found out *while I was shopping for my wedding dress* that the lab that handles the other biopsy, the ERA, did not get enough sample tissue **again**.

I am now waiting for CD1 so I can know when my first Depot Lupron shot is and I have a What the Actual Fuck meeting on Monday with my RE.

Who can give me the nitty gritty on the Depot Lupron? Obviously I'm not looking for ""success"" stories, but someone to tell me what I'm really in for.

In January of 2014 she had an emergency surgery when we found out she had endometriosis. The doctor removed as much as he could at the time, but the left ovary was still stuck to the uterus. She had another surgery in January of 2015 and the removed more adhesions, but knew it would be an ongoing issue.

Months go by and we continue to struggle with infertility, but doctors keep telling us it's possible. But they say things like ""you're a great candidate for IVF"" which is... one way of putting it. Another way is, ""you won't be able to get pregnant unless you do IVF."" We don't have the money for that though. She is going back to school for nursing right now and I am a wedding photographer. We aren't exactly swimming in the big bucks.

Last August, she started finding blood in her stool and was concerned. The doctor had her get a colonoscopy and the colonoscopy doctor said going into the procedure ""I've never seen endometriosis spread to the colon. You're fine. It's probably just a hemorrhoid.""

Guess what? It was endo. Pretty bad actually.

Our fertility doctor suggested we go through IUI treatments in 2017 after a few months of Lupron to prepare her body for it. Those didn't work and that brings us to today.

She's waking up now and the doctors met with me over the past couple hours. The doctors spent 5 hours in the operating room. The endometriosis doctor removed a lot of endometriosis (one adhesion or maybe cyst, everything is blurring together now, was 10cm) There's still more on her diaphragm that the doctor called ""aggressive"". She wasn't comfortable removing without a cardiologist (or something like that) in the operating room. So there are more surgeries in the future.

The doctor removed her left fallopian tube today and had to sew up her left ovary. The right side looks ""okay"" but the doctor still recommends that we pursue pregnancy ASAP and ""IVF should be at the top of our list"". She also said that her case of endometriosis may be the most aggressive she's ever seen.

She also had about 6 inches of her colon removed today and the colon doctor said the colon was covered in endometriosis. He stitched it back together and she'll be recovering in the hospital for the next 4-5 days.

My husband and I have severe MFI. His count was below 500,000 at last check with 0% motility and morphology. So basically zero chance of conception without IVF/ICSI. 

We live in Prague and both have insurance through our employers which will cover the majority of the cost. We do not want to use donor sperm so we can't start until my husbands count gets better. They've put him on a whole bunch of vitamins and we have a test late August to see if that worked then the if not we will move onto something stronger. So we won't start treatment maybe until early 2018. 

Anyway, even though I know that we can't fall pregnant naturally I still time intercourse and use pre-seed conception lubricant. Then every month every time I feel nauseated and my boobs hurt (which happens every time I get my period) I have a little glimmer of hope.

And of course I feel disappointed and stupid every month.

Me- 33F, Husband 39M
Trying for 2+ years.

Currently seeing an RE at Shady Grove fertility, one of the best fertility clinics in the country. Have had tests done and results are not looking good...

* My day 2 blood work and baseline ultrasound (July 2017) - **antral follicle count 9, FSH 28** - doc states **""premature ovarian failure""**
* **AMH 1.4** June 2017
* Exploratory lap Oct 2016 clear
* HSG in Oct 2016 clear
* short 25 day cycles, periods last 3-4 days

Doc says he's not worried about my husbands count even though last SA was done Aug 2016. This is the only SA he has done.
* SA Results (3ml) 47mil/ml, 64% motile, 3% morph.

We had genetic screening done through Counsyl, and lo and behold, turns out we are **both cystic fibrosis carriers, which means there is a 25% chance that any children we may have will have the disease.**

Doctor suggests we go straight to IVF with PGS testing. We have not done any fertility treatments up to this point besides the tests listed above. No meds, no IUI's etc.

Cost for one fresh IVF cycle 15,500 (plus 5-8k for meds) with embryo biopsy. FET are $4600. No refunds.

Cost for 2 fresh IVF cycles 21,500 (plus 5-8k meds each cycle) with embryo biopsy. Unlimited FET cycles. No refunds.

We were told because of our cystic fibrosis carrier status and my FSH & egg count that we don't qualify for the Shared Risk 100% refund program (6 IVF cycles). This sucks because frankly, it makes me feel like our doctor/clinic is just trying to get us to fork over 35k+ for the multi-cycle program, knowing that everything will likely fail. Also, why hasn't he requested another sperm analysis from my husband?

Any advice? Do these costs seem high? Is it better to travel out of state for IVF since **we are paying completely out of pocket (no insurance coverage for infertility)**?
