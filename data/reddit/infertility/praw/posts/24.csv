We went today for the 12 week u/s (I'll be 12 weeks in 2 days) and the second I saw the screen, I knew. No movement. The doc got quiet, my husband and I looked at each other, and I fucking knew.

I don't really remember a lot of what the doc said after, but I have to decide when I want to do my d&c procedure, and they will do genetic testing on the placenta and fetus. I can only hope that it was due to something that is not going to cause problems for future attempts.

<p>Most of you know, we&#39;re moving across the country at the end of the month. So, there is no room for any delays. This IVF cycle has to stay on track or it&#39;ll be cancelled entirely. I know we could cycle in our new home town, but it&#39;ll be months before that could happen. </p>

<p>I know it wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world if we were delayed, but we <em>really</em> love our RE here, we want to see this IVF cycle through with him because he knows our history and my body and it&#39;s quirks. He&#39;s really optimistic for us and I just want to get through this cycle with him, here, before we move. I just don&#39;t really, really, really want this to work out so badly y&#39;all.</p>

<p>My appointment is at 3:15. I&#39;m so scared y&#39;all. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: guys y&#39;all sure know hoe to make a girl feel loved and supported! We are cyst-free and I can start Lupron today!!!</strong></p>

We were never given odds of getting pregnant naturally because there were essentially odds to be given. He was given clomid to take for 6 months to boost our odds of finding sperm in a micro-tese.. But the urologist is not very optimistic about that.

Out of nowhere, I got my period after 13 months of not having one, last Thursday. I'm used to it being heavy, and clotty, and crampy because they come so few and far between (although I was down to 45 day cycles for a while but stopped when I got stressed out). But this one was so much different, my lower back was incredibly sore and my cramps in the front were worse than I've ever felt. And the blood was pink aside from the clots, instead of dark red, and the clots looked smaller than I'm used to, which made no sense to me because I figured they'd be huge after a year. But aside from being suddenly different, on Monday night I felt something fall out of me. 

I've felt huge clots the size of my palm come out, and this wasn't the same. I felt it slide all the way out, and it did not feel the same at all. I've never been urged to look at a clot in the toilet out of shock from the odd feeling, since the first time I had a giant clot when I was on horrible birth control. 

It was of course covered in blood, but there was tissue in it. It was a long line of tissue, on one end it looked like umbilical cord tissue (colour, length, consistency, etc) and on the other it looked kind of like frayed ends of veins, and it looked like just shredded tissue with blood clots in it along it. The only reason why my mind jumped to miscarriage was because in dental hygiene school we had a semester of histology & embryology. 

My rational brain said not to jump to conclusions, took a pregnancy test, came out negative, and said it's probably just something else. 

My mom convinced me to go to the ER, where the doctor treated me like a hypochondriac for suggesting I was scared I was having a miscarriage but I wasn't sure if I could even be pregnant and because their tests came back and I was testing negative for hcg both in blood and urine. 

No ultrasound to follow up, nothing. They made me wait 9 hours overnight for that. Not even a physical exam was done. They assumed because I had no detectable levels of hcg, I could not have had a miscarriage. I don't know if that I'd 100% accurate, but I know that even now, I am still in so much pain. They could have at least checked for alternatives. 

Nope. He just ended the ER visit with, ""you're not pregnant."" Wow, thanks doctor. Thanks for the obvious, because even if I was, I wouldn't be now. Frick. Why does being a woman have to be so complicated? 

Anyhow, is there any experiences you've had similar that were not miscarriages? I know endometriosis involves passing tissue, but would it resemble that? I've never been diagnosed and I will be going to an obgyn very soon.. But I just got back to work after an 8 month leave of absence so I have to wait :(

Seriously. I can't stop thinking. This is so stupid. I know I saw what I saw, but maybe I should just be realistic and accept it could have just been a visual coincidence?

I had a miscarriage after my first IVF cycle and fresh transfer in April that started with some pain along my left side back on May 10 (~5w5d). On May 11 I went to the hospital and they did an US which showed a small ""lesion"" near my left ovary, where the pain was coming from (measuring about 1.5x1x1cms). The US was unable to locate a gestational sac and an ectopic was never ruled out.

My miscarriage started on May 16 (full flow) and I'm still bleeding ~17 days later although the bleeding has tapered off and is pretty light  and has been for about a week and a half (only need a panty liner). Anyways, I went back to the hospital on May 31 because I was still having some slight cramping occasionally on my left side and the ongoing bleeding. The cramping hadn't felt like anything more than a cramp you get from running, very mild. The Dr ran more bloodwork (beta down to 94) and the ultrasound showed the 'lesion' had increased to 4x2x2cms in the 3 weeks since I had first gone in. The ER dr did a consult with the OBGYN and they both agreed to do more ""wait and see"" and to come back if the pain increased.

This lesion has got me super nervous; now that I know it's there and that it's grown I can feel it and am more sensitive to it and I'm scared that it may rupture. Does anyone have any experience or knowledge to share? I've read that they don't always cause pain when they rupture and it seems like if it is painful, it may not last too long.

----------


This has been a process for us, not as long as many women, but longer than we had hoped. I had a feeling I was going to have a hard time getting pregnant because when I was young and naive, well, let's just say I should have been pregnant a long time ago because I ^was ^^not ^^^careful, but I never was and I just chalked it up to doing something right **LOL**. 

*Anyway*. Fast forward to December 2014, ""Let's do it."" We start trying. 12 cycles of nothing. Go to the doctor start Metformin. 6 cycles of nothing. Now Femara. I took my first dose today. Last night my period decided to come a week early and I was happy because it means my cycles are becoming more and more regular (120 days now down to 35), but I was also sad because this was just another wasted cycle. He didn't understand why I was upset, he said ""so what, we just keep trying, it's not hard"". 

... 

*What?* Not hard? Not hard for who because it's sure as hell hard for me. Every single month is an emotional drain, every month is disappointment and frustration, every month is tracking, testing and taking medication twice a day *every day*. Every month is hard. 19 hard months. 19 disappointments. 306 pills. 50+ tests. 8 doctor visits. Don't tell me it's not hard. 

I know he wasn't trying to be malicious and that he loves me and is just as excited and hopeful as I am, it just shocked me because I'm just now starting to realize that *so many* people have no idea how hard this really is unless you flat out explain it to them.

I'm not sure what the point of this is, I just figured I can't be the only one feeling this. If this doesn't work, I don't know how I'm going to mentally and emotionally level out. I feel so all over the place. Sometimes I'm excited, sometimes I just want to hide in a corner. 

So, what keeps you going? What keeps you hopeful?

Last year I found an amazing music school and I have finally been learning how to sing (without sounding like an angry frog) and read music, things I've longed to do for years. It's a pretty intense school though, because they're mostly a music conservatory for kids who want to become professional musicians one day. The school treats the adults like we're just as serious as the kids, despite the fact that none of us adults are going to go on to be opera stars or concert pianists. There are exams and attendance requirements, and if you don't go to enough lessons, they kick you out and you can't come back.

Anyway, you have to sign up for an entire school year, and they give first-year students a priority until the end of June to re-sign up. So I have to make a decision this month about what to do. I would love to sign up for a second year (as long as I pass my music exams, eek!), but this IVF limbo makes everything so hard that I don't know what to do.

I don't even know when we're going to do the next cycle/egg retrieval: maybe at the beginning of July, maybe the middle of August. Which means that if we get lucky and everything goes better than it did last time, there's a chance that next year I could be pregnant with a baby on the way right when the final exams were scheduled (not exactly ideal timing).

On the other hand, the second cycle could go just as badly as the first one, and then I would have dropped out of my music school for nothing.

33,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So...at my appointment this morning to check on my lining after saying we'd pump me full of estrogen in three different ways rather than just two...my lining was still under 7 mm (6.6, to be precise).  Walked out of the office trying really hard not to feel defeated but knowing that we likely still had some time on our hands.  

Bloodwork came back today, and my LH is starting to elevate (at was 14 yesterday, and 23 today), even though I really don't have any big follicles growing at all.  I think at this point my estrogen is just getting high enough for long enough that my body is doing a WTF.  Doc said she hemmed and hawed for a good long while today about whether we could go another day before starting PIO or whether I needed to start it tonight before I was in danger of just ovulating on my own.  Ultimately, she decided that based on my history it was go time for a few reasons: 

1) My LH loves to surge on its own - I've done 4 IUIs and for every single one my LH has spiked before someone could tell me it was time for a trigger.  So this is very likely a real spike that began this morning and which means that my progesterone is starting to rise no matter what we do.  

2) Doc says, listen.  6.6 mm is really not that far away from 7, which is the minimum she'd rather.  Her words - a millimeter is very, very small, and she might have even gotten 7 had she measured, because 0.4 millimeters is even smaller.  My estrogen looked good and high, the triple-stripe pattern on my lining has been there for a few days, everything else says my lining is ready except for how cushy it is.  

2) We have never, EVER, in two years of fertility treatment, ever measured my lining at anything thicker than 7 mm.  My lining was just about 7 mm exactly (rounded up) on the day of the IUI that got me pregnant with Ethan.  So...I could just be a person with a thin lining.  Maybe adding more estrogen vaginally earlier would have helped, or maybe Viagra would have helped - I guess we'll find out next cycle if this one is a bust.  Or maybe we can just look at how I got pregnant with a 7 mm lining before and go with that. I will never forget the words of the doc on the morning of that IUI... ""I've seen a pregnancy with that lining before.""  

So...here we go.  Just did my first PIO injection, and now I'm sitting on a heating pad.  I confess that I feel like especially after everything else I've gone through, there's no way this is going to be successful now.  I know that statistics should be meaningless to me now; after all, 1% of people with cervical issues lose a pregnancy, and 1% of pregnancies are ectopic, and repeated ectopics are just a tiny fraction of those people who even have an ectopic in the first place, and most people whose ectopics are resoled with methotrexate don't wind up having to lose their tubes...I could go on.  But I can't help but fixate on how my 60%+ chances of success this first cycle are now looking more like 10%.

<p>Bloodwork came back today, and my LH is starting to elevate (at was 14 yesterday, and 23 today), even though I really don&#39;t have any big follicles growing at all.  I think at this point my estrogen is just getting high enough for long enough that my body is doing a WTF.  Doc said she hemmed and hawed for a good long while today about whether we could go another day before starting PIO or whether I needed to start it tonight before I was in danger of just ovulating on my own.  Ultimately, she decided that based on my history it was go time for a few reasons: </p>

<p>1) My LH loves to surge on its own - I&#39;ve done 4 IUIs and for every single one my LH has spiked before someone could tell me it was time for a trigger.  So this is very likely a real spike that began this morning and which means that my progesterone is starting to rise no matter what we do.  </p>

69,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband and I have been trying for a baby since early 2014. We have unexplained infertility, have been on clomid with HCG triggers, and have had one devastating first trimester miscarriage. The only people who know all of this are my health care providers. My sister knows about the miscarriage but not the infertility (I shared when she had a threatened miscarriage, and instantly regretted it due to a loss of control of the information - but now I am okay with it).
Initially we chose to keep all this private because we thought it was no one else's business if we were trying to have a baby, and we were doing that classic wait til 12 weeks to tell people (we took this very seriously, no one knew we were trying). Then when things took longer than expected we thought naively that it would all be ok and if we just kept trying we would eventually get pregnant. The longer it went, the more entrenched it became to stay silent about it, and besides it was a bit embarrassing and I felt like a failure. 
However the longer I go through this, the more I feel I would like some support and sympathy from my friends - and maybe my family (although I am worried they might get annoyingly over-sympathetic/pitying and make me feel worse, plus I don't really want to have to explain the infertility procedures and processes to anyone and I know they will want to know every detail, especially my mother). Problem is I don't know who to tell and how. My two best friends (R and B) are complex - R has a baby, is trying for another, and intermittently whines that she wants me to start having children too (so I resent her a bit!) and B is a great listener and her own sister went through IVF, but she is adamant that she herself doesn't want kids and her husband is threatening to leave her over it. Yeouch. So neither of them are great choices. 
Then there are two other good friends (T and G), but both have had babies in the last year and while my gut feeling is that they would be great and supportive, I'm worried about making them feel awkward discussing motherhood in front of me. Possibly they suspect already that there is a problem, but once I let that information go, it is no longer mine to control. (Yes I am a control freak which is just fantastic in a situation where I totally lack control like infertility).
Finally there is another couple we are friends with who have been married a similar amount of time and we suspect they might also be having difficulties, but we don't really know and it might just be awkward if they aren't in the same place.
My husband wants to keep things quiet still but he understands I am starting to think about being open with people, and he is ok with doing that if it will make things easier for me - we've considered it before. We are both really stressed by all this and maybe being open might be a better thing for us - but if it feels worse we can't take it back. We would absolutely not tell our colleagues but luckily our friends and family have nothing to do with our workplaces.

I don't know what to do - sorry for the long post but I guess I wonder if anyone else has kept it all bottled up like this before and if so, did you just keep staying silent, or did you eventually share and how did that make you feel?

We have unexplained infertility, have been on clomid with HCG triggers, and have had one devastating first trimester miscarriage. The only people who know all of this are my health care providers. My sister knows about the miscarriage but not the infertility (I shared when she had a threatened miscarriage, and instantly regretted it due to a loss of control of the information - but now I am okay with it).
Initially we chose to keep all this private because we thought it was no one else&#39;s business if we were trying to have a baby, and we were doing that classic wait til 12 weeks to tell people (we took this very seriously, no one knew we were trying). Then when things took longer than expected we thought naively that it would all be ok and if we just kept trying we would eventually get pregnant. The longer it went, the more entrenched it became to stay silent about it, and besides it was a bit embarrassing and I felt like a failure.

I am supposed to start taking Estrace once I get a positive ovulation test to begin my second round of IVF. Obviously, my body is out of whack from the last round. I started my period on day 37 (first one after ER) but I usually start on day 26. 

I always, always, always get a positive ovulation test on days 11-14. This time around, I wasn't having any symptoms of ovulation and was on day 14. I just had a feeling nothing was going to happen so I emailed the nurse and she scheduled me to come in for an ultrasound and bloodwork on day 16. Well, that day I had cervical mucus, soreness in my boobs, and some twinging in my right ovary. I took the test and got two lines! I was so excited that I emailed the nurse. She canceled my ultrasound and sent the protocol for me to start the Estrace today (Saturday).

After all the excitement was over, I noticed that the second line wasn't really solid. I assumed I'd get a strong positive the next day... and didn't. I've tested morning and night everyday for the past 4 days. ALL of them are light second lines. I haven't had any cervical mucus since that first day. Tonight's test was clearly negative with only one line. But this morning's was the closest to being positive and my left ovary has been having some feelings today. 

My questions: Did I even ovulate? Should I take the Estrace tonight and try to get in touch with doctor tomorrow? If I didn't ovulate, will it mess up this cycle/round of IVF? If I didn't ovulate, would it even matter if I'm not technically starting stims and IVF til after my period?

[link to past post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4k9mp5/new_to_the_shitty_club_hello/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

Yesterday was 8 days into the cycle, and my RE called to tell me that she recommended canceling the retrieval!  I'm very new to this, and didn't even realize that this was a possibility?  It looks like my left ovary isn't responding to anything probably due to endo, and my right side produced 3 viable follicles that were 29mm, 21mm, and 17mm respectively.  She recommended that we stop now, and use remaining resources (money, mainly) into another cycle, and this time max out the hormone dosage (since it seems like unfortunately I wasn't responding well enough to 300 gonal F and 150 menopur).  She also said that it kinda looks like if we are emotionally ready, she strongly (medically) recommends going straight into directly doing IVF.

We ended up having to decide in an hour to cancel or to move forward, because I had to decide whether to use the trigger shot or not!  We ended up deciding to cancel, taking her advice.  Though I do wonder... what if we got 3 viable eggs frozen?! I mean it really seemed unlikely, and even so it's such a small number, but still.

Feeling slightly overwhelmed!  I don't think we are really ready to do direct IVF now, but on the other hand I think we would severely regret in the future not trying our best when it really does seem like our last shot.  In our mid 20s.  And I've still got this interview in another city!

Does anyone have any advice on how to manage work/family priorities?  I'm trying hard to pursue both at the same time but it is getting difficult.  I'm not sure what I would regret more- a missed opportunity at a fantastic company that I've been trying to get for a few years, or a missed opportunity for being able to have a child.  It's difficult- it's like we skipped to our 30s, especially when we still feel like we are still adjusting to post college/grad life!

Thought I would share. If you're not in the mood for a little sentimentality, maybe this isn't for you, but it was cathartic for me.


Hey kid, we need to talk.


Now I know you're not born yet but I'm still your mom so you have to listen to me. Thems the rules.


And maybe I'm a little cranky because I've been on a liquids and laxatives only diet for the past day and a half, but that doesn't make what I'm about to say any less valid. I'm sure I'll be cranky after you show up too so I guess you should start getting used to it now.


But you might never get the chance to show up at all if you don't listen up. And that would just be a big bummer for both of us, yeah?


So here's the deal - I need you to put in a good word with the Big Guy for us today. See kid, you might not really understand what's going on down here because you've never had a body, but I'm getting surgery today. Surgery for you.


You just so happened to have the bum luck to get stuck with a mom with endometriosis. Big word, I know. But it means that your mom's ovaries and tubes are all gunked up with tissue that's growing where it shouldn't be. It's making it pretty hard for any eggs to get to where they need to be - my uterus.


I know you're probably thinking, ""Ewww mom!!! I don't want to hear about your uterus!"" Well tough luck. Because if this surgery actually works the way we're hoping it will, in the very near future that uterus is going to be your home for 9 whole months. I'm trying to give you a nice place to grow. So help a girl out, ok?


Because I've already had to put up with a lot to try to get you here. I've spent thousands of dollars, seen 10 doctors in 2 countries, been stuck with needles to have over a dozen vials of blood drawn, been probed by several cold and goopy ultrasound wands up the vagina, spent countless hours in waiting rooms, and taken pills that made me the equivalent of an emotional bouncy castle.


I lost 50 pounds to increase my chances to get you here. Granted, I've gained half of that back but still, I'm trying here!


Ive cried 56 times. Once for every month when you still hadn't shown up.


And now I'm sitting in a breezy hospital gown, waiting to go into surgery for the first time in my life. I'm scared. But I'm willing to do this because I love you and I really want to meet you.


So what I'm saying is, it's your turn to step up. If you could arrange some stuff on your end so that the surgeon can free up my ovaries and tubes, I'd really appreciate it.


Because if this surgery doesn't turn out, I'm not going to get to meet you for a really long time. I'll have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on IVF. Money we just don't have right now. And I'll have to go through a whole new level of hell with hormone injections and egg retrieval and insemination and it would just be really great if we could avoid all that.


But if at the end of the day that's what we have to do to get you here, then that's what we'll do. And if that doesn't work and it turns out you have to be born to another mom before I get to have you, then that's what I'll do too. Because I'm your mom.


I love you kid. Please get here soon so I can give you a hug and cover you with kisses and nag you to clean your room and embarrass you in front of your friends and do all the things a good mom does.

FSH = 19.7
AMH = .55
Antral Follicle Count = 5

Officially DOR :-(

My RE said bc I'm young (31) the quality of eggs should hopefully be good, so we can hope to get 1-3 embryos for IVF based on this, each try with a ~15% chance of success. 

Although I'm plenty scared of being in that 85% of failures, my biggest fear right now is of the drugs and their affect on me. I have 2 blood clotting factors (factor V and factor 2) and my RE already said we'd have to go full strength on drugs (is this what you call stims?) if we want any chance of me getting pregnant with my own eggs. I've never had a blood clot despite being on the pill for 7 years, but my Dad (rat bastard who passed down these troll genes to me) has had DVTs several times, starting in his 30s. I have this crazy fear of having a heart attack or stroke before I even implant. 

I still have a while before we start planning for IVF: we have 2-3 more weeks before genetic tests/fragile x/antibodies tests come back. Then I really don't know exactly what the process looks like, in terms of time. My RE said that baby aspirin now is good, but she didn't see any reason to start blood thinner until after getting a confirmed positive...but I'm terrified that she's wrong, that I should start blood thinners with the IVF drugs. I'm seeing a hematologist on June 21 but I'm thinking I should get this info from that specialist sooner. Im worried that taking the drugs will kill me. 

I also should mention I'm highly prone to anxiety (particularly the kind where I'm afraid I'm going to die) so I never know what is real fear or pain and what is panic. I don't know how I'm going to deal with any of it...the hormones or blood thinners (which if I don't take them, I'll fear dying of a blood clot, and if I do, I'll be afraid of internal bleeding at every turn.)

Really scared and nervous and just full of dread about all of it. DOR, double clotting disorders, and anxiety are stacked and making me want to give up on IVF before we even start. But even though the odds of me actually getting pregnant are slim, I know I'd regret it if I didn't try. And my husband would be resentful, even if he didn't say it.

To tell me that she was pregnant and scared.  Scared?  Mainly because she didn't expect to get pregnant so quickly.  She knew that we'd been struggling with infertility and still some how this seemed like a good idea.  So I ""womaned"" up and tried to be as supportive as I possibly could.  We live in different states and mainly communicate over Google chat.  When she got her required genetic testing results, I asked her how it went and tried to assuage her concerns.  But then after 2 months of negative results and the evil-devil that is Clomid raging through my system I just started to pull away from her.  I asked her about other things in her life but not her pregnancy.  Over the past month, she abruptly stopped replying to my messages and then today tells me that she knows that i'm dealing with fertility issues and she's not talking about baby stuff all the time but that i've been a crappy friend for not asking even one question about her pregnancy.  

i apologized to her immediately and told her that i was sorry for not being supportive during what is a very joyous time in her life and that if given a chance i'll do better.  but there is a part of me that wants to smack her and say ""are f*cking kidding me?"" 

does anyone have any words of wisdom?  i didn't say or do anything wrong per se but i can definitely see how she is feeling hurt that i haven't been asking about her pregnancy.  it's pretty clear she has absolutely no idea what i'm going through and why i wasn't asking any questions.  

how can i fix this without feeling completely shitty or disingenuous while doing so?  

i told her i'd reach out to her over email so she could reply if she wants to.  and i guess i'll just suck it up because it's fairly obvious she has absolutely no idea what it's like to deal with infertility, be on hormones, or any bit of this process that any of us are on.  i'm not even sure i want to explain... i'd rather just make her happy and realize that she's never going to understand. 

[Note: i'm 100% positive she has no clue about dealing with infertility because we've talked about it in the past]

For the most part, I am fine seeing pictures of kids on Facebook. I find kids lovely, and I like to see updates about my friends kids (especially the ones I adore).

What drives me absolutely nuts, however, are the stay at home moms who *only* post about their kids, the ones who post memes about motherhood, the ones who link (inaccurate) shit like [this](https://www.facebook.com/DavidAvocadoWolfe/photos/a.10150364951666512.342374.102515706511/10153493082606512/?type=3&theater) or [this](https://www.facebook.com/thescarymommy/photos/a.375569458300.155039.295199098300/10153949558503301/?type=3&theater).

I also hope that I will not only be defined by motherhood, etc.), so I am not more jealous of them than  any or my other friends with kids. 

So why do they bother me so much? Are these type of parents just generally annoying, and it has nothing to do with my struggles (that would be GREAT)? Is it that I am upset because I find their online behavior inconsiderate of people who are struggling? Am I upset because I lost them as friends? Do I secretly want their lives but am not aware?

We pretty much thought that our only options at that point in time would be donor sperm or adoption, but after having an embryologist at our RE look at my semen sample in more depth, they discovered that there were some sperm that could potentially be used with IVF ICSI. This was exciting news, but I'm sure as many of you may be able to relate to, having more options (read hard decisions) does not always make things easier. 

My wife has always had a general interest in adoption, even before we had any notion of our infertility issues.  I've always wanted to be a Dad, biologically-related or not.  It was exciting news to learn we could do IVF ICSI, but my wife has reservations about the cost (financial/emotional/health) of IVF, for what may equate to a coin flip given the challenge of my sperm actually fertilizing eggs in-vitro. While it would be really nice to have a child that is biologically related to us, I feel like the emotional strain of going through with something we are not 100% committed to may not be a good decision. 

She will tend to go back and forth on which option is best, and I do as well, making this decision really hard. It is especially hard to communicate about it since it can be such a stressful issue, and let's face it, guys have it really easy in comparison to women with IVF, so I'm trying to keep her perspective in mind throughout discussions. 

What advice can you all provide on communication through some of these types of issues?  Moreover- if we aren't both 100% in on IVF, should we take another route to grow our family?

So we checked again yesterday night, we check our voip, called my mum... nope, no news from clinic.... Hum... why?
Left another message yesterday night, saying that they confirm my thyroid was fine and we could get the biopsy this cycle.
Still no news.
Not sure if there a new shit happening, or if they don't want to leave a message on my parent's voicemail?

I know I am no the only one here who feels that way, but this group of men and women are the only people that truly <em>get</em> it. </p>

<p>Anyway. I am exhausted. Bloated. Cramping. And all I want to eat is ice cream. </p>

He married a woman 12-13 years older than him and they waited a year to start ttc. Due to ovarian aging (low AMH, high FSH), they ended up doing two rounds of IVF. Both failed. They found a great egg donor but he couldn't follow through with it and now they are looking at adoption. 

Jack has been a great supporter because he knows exactly what my husband and I are going through. My diagnosis and protocols are very similar to his wife's (even though I'm 14 years younger). He has reached out to both me and my husband to offer support. However, I've noticed that he seems to be having a very difficult time with all of this. He's not handling it nearly as well as we are. He said he had to dismiss the egg donor but couldn't explain why. In talking about adoption, he told me that he just can't follow through. Forgetting about everything that has happened, stopping the adoption process, and ignoring the problems have been his way of carrying on with life. 

To make a long story short, I found out that he had a few too many drinks one night and started spilling all of his thoughts and feelings to one of my close friends (a former colleague, we'll call her Sal). Sal came to me because she knows of my situation and knows that Jack and I are friends. Here are examples of things Jack said:
- I wish I had known this about my wife before I married her.
- I wouldn't have married her if I knew this would happen.  
- Sometimes I wonder if I need to find a new wife since mine can't give me what I want. 
- If I find a younger woman, I may still be able to have children.

Let me add that this is very out of character for him. I'm trying to understand it from his point of view but hearing these things breaks my heart. I almost started crying wondering how my husband is feeling/what he could be hiding during all this. What would I do if I knew my husband was feeling this way?
My heart is aching for Jack and his wife. 

Since then, he has sent a bunch of random messages to Sal. They don't make a lot of sense and every once in a while he will mention something about leaving his wife and then take it back. 

I'm wondering how much of this he is sharing with his wife. Has she noticed anything different with him? Should I reach out to him to offer my support and suggest that he find a therapist? Sal feels like she should tell the wife about the things he has said. In my opinion, I think Jack is struggling to come to terms with the fact his dream life isn't turning out the way he wanted. In trying to understand and fix it, he's wanting to find answers in the wrong places.

I've been a lurker for a few months. Quick background - husband (33) and I (28) started trying for a baby August 2015, have had two CPs, and were diagnosed with unexplained infertility last month. I know we are not at the one year mark, and I truly hope this does not offend. All my tests (saline sono, HSG) and bloodwork came back fairly normal, except for low vitamin D and higher than average AMH (7.8). Husband's sperm is good except for 3.5% morphology. I have 28 day cycles and ovulate on day 14. We just finished our first cycle on clomid+TI, which was a bust.

We are scheduled to do femara+IUI in the coming cycle. My question is - is there a huge advantage to ultrasound monitoring and trigger? My RE wants me to do OPKs at home. However, I've read that quite a few people are not comfortable doing IUI without ultrasound and trigger.

I'm 27, and I've had a long history with endometriosis- I've had 2 laparoscopic procedures so far in the past 6 years, this past one showing deep infiltrating stage 4 endo.  Pain has definitely been managed surgically, but in terms of fertility, I didn't think too much into it.

My husband and I got married 2 years ago after 4 years of being together, so I'd say that we still qualify as newlyweds! :)  We weren't considering starting a family until 3-4 years from now, and wanted to get married early so that we can enjoy our time together (because of work and school, we've had to spend a lot of time apart in separate cities and have finally been living together for almost 1 year now).  About a month ago, we went to an RE at the insistence of my GYN, and were told that if we ever wanted kids, it was a close to zero chance of it working without IVF, and even with IVF, a very low chance.  I had an AMH level of under 1, and the ultrasounds weren't too promising either.  This was surprising to my RE considering my age, despite the stage 4 endo.  
 
This was confusing news, mainly because we weren't really in a place to think about kids immediately, and now all of a sudden have to decide if it's something we will regret if we don't try IVF asap while there still might be a window!  Lots of long chats ensued, and we decided after some research that it will most likely take a few rounds anyway, so we'll do a round of egg freeze first to see what there is to work with, if anything at all, and then see if doing immediate IVF makes sense for us.  Freezing seemed like a good compromise, and we can always thaw whenever we feel ready, even if it is a couple months later.  Though with my endo, the more time we wait, the less likely we are able to go back in just in case the eggs don't take.

I started my injections a few days ago, and we will see how it goes.  I'm definitely the only one I know of in my friends circle to be dealing with something like this right now, so we are just taking it all day by day and trying to base decisions off of what we find!

We have gone through probably every emotion over the past few weeks, especially since it is not something that we are suddenly being forced to think about, but the thing we are definitely sure of is that we do both want a family someday, so doing nothing is not an option!

185,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all!!

Yesterday was the day I went in to prep for our upcoming IVF cycle.  The plan was to do the saline ultrasound, then the med teach class for the shots we will be administering, then blood work and urine sample.  

Last summer I had my HSG done (all clear)  and while it was def not a walk in the park I didn't have any pain at all besides the 10 seconds they shot dye through the tubes.  Wellllll this was a different experience.  

So the catheter part was good to go, but they kept having to dump more and more saline into my uterus.  Turns out the reason is because they found a polyp on my endometrial lining.  Once they took everything out of me and I sat up they started showing me the polyp on the screen and starting talking about needing to shave it off.  I have no idea what happened to me at that point but I became extremely nauseous.  I laid down on the table and the nurse gave me a cold washcloth for my forehead.  They left the room and said they would give me a couple minutes to get dressed.  So the nausea gets worse.  I essentially crawl to the adjoining bathroom where I lay on the floor with my forehead on the toilet (ew I know but at this point it was so bad).  I end up throwing up twice.  I have no idea why because it wasn't even that painful!!!  What in the world.  Maybe it was the whole talk about shaving off something in my uterus.

<p>Yesterday was the day I went in to prep for our upcoming IVF cycle.  The plan was to do the saline ultrasound, then the med teach class for the shots we will be administering, then blood work and urine sample.  </p>

<p>Last summer I had my HSG done (all clear)  and while it was def not a walk in the park I didn&#39;t have any pain at all besides the 10 seconds they shot dye through the tubes.  Wellllll this was a different experience.  </p>

<p>So the catheter part was good to go, but they kept having to dump more and more saline into my uterus.  Turns out the reason is because they found a polyp on my endometrial lining.  Once they took everything out of me and I sat up they started showing me the polyp on the screen and starting talking about needing to shave it off.  I have no idea what happened to me at that point but I became extremely nauseous.  I laid down on the table and the nurse gave me a cold washcloth for my forehead.  They left the room and said they would give me a couple minutes to get dressed.  So the nausea gets worse.  I essentially crawl to the adjoining bathroom where I lay on the floor with my forehead on the toilet (ew I know but at this point it was so bad).  I end up throwing up twice.  I have no idea why because it wasn&#39;t even that painful!!!  What in the world.  Maybe it was the whole talk about shaving off something in my uterus.</p>

<p>So anyway.  I have my hysteroscopy scheduled for Monday now so they can take care of that and it&#39;ll just be a small bump in the road and won&#39;t throw off the IVF plan.  Anyone have experiences about this to share?  Should I be worried after my extreme reaction to the saline ultrasound?  I am def not a puker type of person.  Thanks in advance!</p>

Today was the first step in our road to a baby, you know, apart from the 18 failed cycles that I've had already. Husband (30) and myself (27) saw a gyno today and started the process to find out what part of us isn't working. 

I got booked for cycle day 2 bloodwork, and because my cycles vary in length, I'm going in for cycle day 21, 23, and 27 to check my progesterone (yay needles and stupid hospital parking charges!). I had a surprise pap today and I was super excited I remembered to shave my legs. 

I also was told to call the gyno when I got my next period so they could book me in for an HSG which after looking at the pamphlets they gave me looks incredibly scary but hopefully you lovely ladies can talk positively about it. 

Mr. SuziQ  got booked for a semen analysis and I'm not sure what he was expecting but he was super pumped that he doesn't have to duck into a closet at the hospital to do his thing (which he can do at home instead). 👌🏻

To complicate matters: I have a past medical condition that the gyno wants confirmation on (I'm a 22 year stroke survivor) before she gets us to continue TTC - so right now we're on a 2 month hiatus while the testing is done and a neurologist checks my brain to make sure there's nothing that could possibly go wrong (the gyno says is merely a precaution however my GP said 18 months ago he wouldn't see anything wrong with it). All this means is I get to enjoy beer this summer and not have to worry which is fine with me.

So -- my wife and I are on try number 7 -- and she just got her period. We are just devastated. She's literally doing everything right, acupuncture, prenatals, little-to-no caffeine, no drinking, etc. She's otherwise healthy, in her mid-twenties, and no family or personal history of anything regarding pregnancy. The timing was good, and the IUI went well. It just felt right this time. But it wasn't.

We are doing IUI because of me... I'm infertile. So we took time to pick a donor that had a similar lineage to me, and had a similar description to me on paper. So this was hard from the start, knowing we had to go this route, that I was limiting our chances per month. I know that regardless of circumstance, many couples go through this all the time. It doesn't make it any easier, or make me feel less guilty. My wife feels like it's her fault she's not pregnant yet. We are just trying to support each other through all of this.

What doesn't make it easier, is that SEVERAL of our friends are pregnant. Of course we want to be happy for them, but it's so hard. 

Next month -- we're doing some testing, I forget the name of it right now. Something with an ultrasound. It's hard to keep all this up, insurance won't kick in until 12 tries.

Technically if the tube is open, i.e. Showed signs of spillage, it is not a hydrosalpinx and you do not need to have the tube removed or ligated. This is because the fluid has somewhere other than your uterus to go. 

My 2nd dr didn't have access to the ultrasound they did at 1st Dr's office after the HSG that supposedly showed the (still) dilated tube 2 weeks after the HSG, so he couldn't really comment on that one. 

My personal opinion is that the tube spilled with the force of injecting the dye in, but when left to its own devices it is more than happy to sit there and/or flow backward. Therefore I wouldn't feel comfortable pursuing IVF without at least poking around in there to see what's going on. I've already had my pre op with the surgeon/1st Dr. Thanks to /u/MackieMouse, I asked and insisted that they do the blue dye test before touching my tubes. Therefore when they go in they will have indisputable proof my tubes are either blocked or clear. Also they will be ""draining"" the ""hydrosalpinx"" assuming there is one. 

So if my tubes are clear and there is no residual dilation, the tube can stay and they will just take a lot of pretty pictures and biopsies to find out what the hell is going on in my abdomen. More likely though, even if my tubes are open, if there is still residual dilation, the tubes gotta go (IMO). I've also discussed with my dr about thoroughly looking at the least shitty tube and make a judgement call during surgery if it had to go too. Bottom line, surgery is still a go for June 9th- just need to verify they don't get too excited with those scalpels too soon.

TL;DR: IVF coordinator sent one sentence email that completely detailed plans in motion, only to find out there is just a slim chance anything at all will change and I should still have the surgery, even if, just for diagnostic purposes.

In other news. 2nd dr is retiring before we will be able to start IVF, so I have to have a meeting to transfer care to a new dr.

My husband's sister is pregnant.  She knows we have been trying for 5 years and have been unsuccessful.  She sent us f--king ultrasound photos on my husband's birthday (a few days ago).  

A few years ago, we went through some major life ""shit"" (not our fault).  After that, my sister-in-law became a major force for evil in our lives.

Worse, each time she achieved one of these goals, she would call members of our extended family, belittling both my husband and myself, saying, like, if we are having so much trouble achieving these goals, there must be something wrong with us, because look at how easy it was for her.

What is most heartbreaking is that before we found out about my sister-in-law's pregnancy, my husband had already floated the idea of giving up trying to conceive.  I worry that this will be the final straw.

I just really needed to put this out there in the world so that I can get it out of my head, and focus on what's coming for us.  We are very lucky to have 4 eggs this time.  Let's hope some of them decide to stick around.

197,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi folks,

I'm meeting with my RE tomorrow morning to talk things over but would love to hear from those of you who have gone through this. 

In short: I'm 32, my AMH is 0.23, my FSH is 14.5, antral follicle count is ~8 depending (I had a big ol' cyst which has hopefully gone away). 

To complicate things, I also probably have tubes which aren't working correctly (though there's no way to completely prove this), so IUI is unlikely to do anything, even if my eggs are fine. 

My RE would like us to start IVF ASAP. I am all for an aggressive start, BUT my insurance company (Aetna) has been arguing that I should try 6 rounds of medicated cycles/ IUI before they'll pay for IVF. I have not done one single medicated cycle yet- I might start round 1 tomorrow, but was benched last month due to the cyst. 

He did say that he would approve me for a shared-risk IVF program, which means it'd be about $22k out of pocket, not counting medication, and we could start right away and bypass insurance. 

I have a couple questions and am wondering if anyone else had to weigh these sorts of decisions:

How much time do I have to waste? We just got my day 3 bloodwork done, we've tested 2 months in a row now but obviously don't have any long-term information, so I have no idea how quickly my fertility is declining. I just know it's pretty bad already. Is waiting 5 more months to satisfy insurance requirements a really bad idea?

Did anyone self-pay with Aetna? If so, did they cover medications? I wonder if we pay the $22k for IVF, if Aetna will still pay for medication and take that out of our fertility insurance bucket. That would be ideal, really, because then we get that $22k back if we're not successful, and we don't have to pay for medication. I have a $25k lifetime limit for fertility payments for insurance, so even if we did 6 rounds of medicated cycles and then IVF, we'd still be paying out of pocket for some of it, because surely all of that costs more than $25k.

So that appointment happened today.  The conclusion was the eggs were no good, subsequent cycles would yield just as few eggs, and sperm actually went down from our last recheck so medicated cycles were out.

We had told her at the transfer that if this didn't work, we wanted to discuss donated embryos.  The DOR and MFI are just incompatible for treatment.  It seems you can have one but not the other, at least that's how it has felt for us. We brought it up again today, and she said she'd get us to talk to the third-party coordinator.  She seemed a little relieved.  I don't blame her-- it's probably painful to watch patients go through multiple cycles with little success. And really, we just want to be parents.  

The meeting with the coordinator went well. She's just an inspiring woman-- she even has been a gestational carrier.  She said the program has embryos at the moment awaiting matches, that she coordinates them herself, the waitlist isn't TOO long, and just overall we felt good about it. Seems that the open donations also offer the right amount of boundaries that we are comfortable with (I was a tad worried given they would be local).  Anyway, she said she just got a larger donation of embryos in, but they are not white and she asked about our openness on that front. My husband and I are both white and blonde-- even if we'd had a white baby, it would likely have not been blonde so it would have raised some eyebrows anyway (because even the dumbest people know that blonde+blonde=blonde), AND we're open about our infertility journey at this point.   We'd previously discussed it, but it never feels real until there is a possibility.  I'm glad to say that even now that the possibility is very real, we are still open to moving ahead with that (I know it presents a unique set of challenges, but we're smart, open people and are willing to overcome hurdles associated with that and advocate for our children in any ways that they may need). Plus, the possibility of a larger set of embryos would mean we'd get to likely have children who are biological siblings, so that unique experience would be shared and no one would experience anything alone, which I love so much.  She said she is working on matching in the next couple weeks, so we could actually know something soon, which fills me with a little hope.  There are no guarantees on a match just yet, but I think this is a step in the right direction.

Lastly, I asked my doctor about some cramping I had around my right ovary (the one that produced all the follicles), worrying that maybe there was endo?  She said it was likely just trauma from the retrieval, but that she'd prescribe me some BCP since we're just going to move on to FETs of donated embryos.  I also asked her if I could go back on keto (I stopped last year once we confirmed I do not have PCOS), as I'd gained 40 lbs throughout the IF process.  She said I didn't look like I'd gained that much weight (awww, nice RE!) and that I could but would have to stop about a month prior to a transfer.  Husband and I talked and even if we match soon, I plan on taking 3 months off to reclaim my body and stop getting probed in the vag for a little bit.  Plus, it'd be awesome to kick my butt back into gear before getting pregnant.

201,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey everyone...

So, to give a brief history, my wife and I have been through three miscarriages. She is curently pregnant for the fourth time. However, she has anxiety about an ultrasound tomorrow that she is suspicious will bring bad news to this pregnancy as well (based on her doctor's visit last week). She is on progesterone and our past issue (if I don't butcher this with my medical ignorance) is that the fetus has trouble attaching to the the wall of her uterus. I like to be cautiously optimistic about most scenarios in life, but if she has an iffy feeling about tomorrow, then I don't want to have my head in the sand.

Now the only advice I am looking for on here, from anyone willing to offer it- are there any specific ideas as to what I should do for her if this ultrasound does not go well tomorrow? I've been playing it supportive, yet calm and reserved with this pregnancy because I don't want to make it about me at all. I don't want her to worry about me and my feelings of the situation. I understand this is our journey, but it's her physical (and psychological) burdens and trauma, which is tough when she is a generous people pleaser who would end up worrying as much (or even more so) about my worries and disappointment. I worry that some of my disappointments in the past losses have brought her added stress. I love this woman so much. She is tough as nails, beyond beautiful and has massive generosity in her heart- the makings of a warm, loving mother. Each time this happens, it understandably drags her into a pit of dispair. It kills me and I feel powerless in my attempts to pull her out when it does happen.

 In the end, she is my wife and I should know her better than anyone.

<p>So, to give a brief history, my wife and I have been through three miscarriages. She is curently pregnant for the fourth time. However, she has anxiety about an ultrasound tomorrow that she is suspicious will bring bad news to this pregnancy as well (based on her doctor&#39;s visit last week). She is on progesterone and our past issue (if I don&#39;t butcher this with my medical ignorance) is that the fetus has trouble attaching to the the wall of her uterus. I like to be cautiously optimistic about most scenarios in life, but if she has an iffy feeling about tomorrow, then I don&#39;t want to have my head in the sand.</p>

<p>Now the only advice I am looking for on here, from anyone willing to offer it- are there any specific ideas as to what I should do for her if this ultrasound does not go well tomorrow? I&#39;ve been playing it supportive, yet calm and reserved with this pregnancy because I don&#39;t want to make it about me at all. I don&#39;t want her to worry about me and my feelings of the situation. I understand this is our journey, but it&#39;s her physical (and psychological) burdens and trauma, which is tough when she is a generous people pleaser who would end up worrying as much (or even more so) about my worries and disappointment. I worry that some of my disappointments in the past losses have brought her added stress. I love this woman so much. She is tough as nails, beyond beautiful and has massive generosity in her heart- the makings of a warm, loving mother. Each time this happens, it understandably drags her into a pit of dispair. It kills me and I feel powerless in my attempts to pull her out when it does happen.</p>

<p>In the end, she is my wife and I should know her better than anyone. However, I figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt to reach out to hear from anyone in similar situations who have been given strong support or, inversely, had their partner say or do the exact wrong thing for the situation. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. This woman is everything to me.</p>

Long time lurker who decided to finally post. 

Reason being: I have my first IVF coming up. I just started BC after being off BC for 10 years and I feel like it is affecting me a lot more this time around than I can remember from the past. I am not sure if this whole infertility biznass has made me more attuned to my body, if my body has changed over the years, or if its the type of pill, but it's making me worried about what to expect once I start the real deal (stimulation). If I am feeling tender, moody, and am breaking out like a teen from these tiny pills, what will happen once I start pumping a pretty aggressively dosed cocktail of hormones into my body??? 

Anyone care to share their experience so that I can get an idea of what these hormones will do to me? I know that everyone is different, but at this point I just don't know what to expect at all.

Any other tips? Any info would be welcome. I am trying to be healthy and cut down on caffeine and alcohol (my doctor actually said I could drink socially and moderately up until I start my cycle, but I wasn't sure if my doc and I share the same definition of moderation or what it means to drink socially (do pets count, for example?)). Anything else I should be aware of?

""Just wanted to inform you that [Gizmos_Human's] Dr. reviewed the images from your hysteroscopy at UW and he does not believe surgical removal of the tubes or ligation is necessary.""

Umm WTF? Doesn't this warrant a phone call? 

First of all, I has a hystosalpingogram not a hysteroscopy. Is it the same thing? Is it possible that she just misspoke or does my dr not know what test he's looking at?

Assuming they are looking at the right thing and their new recommendation stands, has anyone had any experience with differing interpretations of HSG test results?

I am freaking out right now. I already emailed and called and left a message with her to be like... Umm ok, so wtf does that mean for my treatment options?

Details for the unfamiliar. First RE did HSG and on the spot diagnosed one blocked tube with hydrosalpinx and other tube showing signs of damage so tubal ligation was required before IVF and IVF was the only option. Immediately made an appointment for 2nd opinion with new clinic and had to wait 2 months to get in. At this appointment the dr said he hasn't seen the films but was confident in the diagnosis and then spent 2 hours talking about his IVF protocol for me. This is now the same dr, who I guess finally got around to actually looking at the films. Based on all of this we decided to proceed with tubal ligation, ER, FET. In the mean time though, the first dr recommended me to a surgeon, and that office had called to schedule said surgery, but I decided to schedule with my original RE who could also perform the surgery for June 9th. My mother bought plane tickets to help me through the surgery and everything.

I mean ultimately it would be a dream come true for my tubes to remain intact (assuming they are healthy). It might even mean we don't need to jump straight into IVF.

-June 2014-May 2015: I go off of birth control, have regular 28-30 day cycles, track my ovulation and cycles using Ovia and have sex during fertile periods, never get pregnant.

-Mid May 2015-Have an annual appointment with my OB/GYN and tell her we have been trying for 10 months without success. She asks about me and I tell her things seem on track. She asks about my husband and I explain that he has been on testosterone supplements for approx. 2.5 years. Her response is RED FLAG!!!

-Late May 2015-My OB/GYN orders my husband’s blood and semen samples to be tested.

-Mid June 2015-I get a call at work that my husband’s sperm count is zero. I proceed to lose my shit. Cry all the tears.

-Late June 2015-We have always been open to adoption, the original thought was to have 1-2 of our own and then adopt. We decide to flip the plan and pursue adoption while figuring out how to have biological children. We also meet with a urologist who is optimistic that stopping testosterone and letting his body regulate will allow my husband to produce sperm again. She writes him a daily Clomid prescription.

-July 2015-Pick an adoption agency in Atlanta and attend a seminar. Sperm count still zero.

-August 2015-attend workshop with adoption agency, sign contract to join agency and begin monthly payments. Contract “guarantees one successful adoption.” We are optimistic. Sperm count still zero.

-September 2015-I complete all of my home study paperwork, husband drags his feet. Sperm count still zero.
October 2015-Husband has sperm! Clomid is a wonderful drug. All of his numbers (count, motility etc.) are in the low end of the normal range. We have sex but I am confident that we missed our window for the month.

-October 27 2015-CD1

-November 2015-Finally ovulate on CD 23, sex on that day but no other due to scheduling etc. (husband in a night nurse in an ER).

-Dec 2015- I know my period is coming and I am out for the month, just waiting for it to start in full force so we can move on to the next cycle.

-January 2016- I forget what we did this month, I didn’t get pregnant and decide to be more aggressive. 

-February 2016- First round of Clomid, 100 mg CD 3-7, timed intercourse. We complete all of our adoption paperwork and start on our Dear Birth Mother letter.

-March 2016- Second cycle of Clomid, Ovidrel trigger shot, timed intercourse. Our timing was really good this cycle and I was really optimistic.

-April 2016-I move to a new OB/GYN practice which I LOVE. Third and final round of Clomid, HSG where the MD called my uterus and fallopian tubes pretty, and beautiful and told me to put them on my resume. First attempt at IUI.
-May 2016-Femara CD 4-8, second attempt at IUI. Home study and birthmother letter complete. Hoping to go live with our adoption in the next 60 days.

211,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So for everyone following along with my saga, I do have an update on what the hell happened at my retrieval.  We finally spoke to our doctor today for the first time since before the retrieval.  If you recall, that was 3 days before the retrieval, and at the time I had 14 mature follicles and another 5-7 medium follicles.  He seemed pretty confident that we should get around 20 eggs overall, but those out of the medium follicles probably wouldn't be mature.  

And on retrieval day, a different doctor did the actual retrieval, and he was only able to get 9 eggs (not 20), and of those we were told by embryology that only 5 were mature.  The Dr. who did the retrieval said something about the Lupron shot not working as intended and that the eggs were likely still ""stuck"" to the wall of the follicle and didn't detach like they were supposed to.

Our doctor does not think it was the case though.  He said he looked at my blood work (LH levels, progesterone levels) and everything was looking exactly like it should under successful trigger circumstances.  He also said a Lupron trigger fail is more likely to result in a complete failure - no eggs - and it doesn't really do a half-and-half situation like we had.

He said that overall he thinks the follicles were completely empty, and that is supported by the remaining 4 eggs that weren't mature.  So going back, we had 9 eggs retrieved, and we were told 5 of them were mature (and ICSI'd).  We understandably assumed that meant the remaining 4 were simply immature.  Not the case.  Those 4 were total shit.  They were a mixture of broken zonas and empty zonas.  They were totally unusable and no amount of maturing was going to do the trick.

But then he said I'm kind of an enigma, because on one hand I create either nothing or total crap, and on the other hand my 5 eggs that were good were ""rockstars"" (his words) and he chuckled when he said that getting all 5 eggs to blast was very uncommon.  He kept saying that I was very black or white - terrible or awesome.  So go me?

Anyway, overall he was very enthusiastic about the 4 good blasts we have frozen.  I know the 5th isn't awesome (4BC) and at some point when we get to that one, we'll pair it up with a better one.  But for now, we'll start with our perfect little ninja, the 4AA day 5, for a single embryo transfer on June 3rd.  Just over two weeks away!

In the end, he definitely thinks this is a systemic issue with my ovaries and that it's likely a big contributing factor to our infertility.  We still don't know of course if we also have an issue getting the sperm into the egg naturally because we did ICSI, so who knows on that one, but at a minimum we can pretty confidently say that there are likely few cycles in the past 3 years where there was a usable egg (or even an egg at all).  But that also does explain why we did get pregnant once, because I don't make 100% crap eggs.  And that one time was just bad luck that it was a blighted ovum.

Oh and finally, we did ask if he thought that the egg quality of the remaining 5 could be poor and impact success, and he said not at this point.  He said they wouldn't have fertilized and they definitely wouldn't have made it to blast, so he was confident in the quality of the 5 we do have.

GPS announces we're about to turn on to tapachalpus street (or some other equally hard to spell/pronounce name). So I ask the driver how the GPS does with all the street names around there. She laughs and says it's gotten a lot better, but then lists a bunch of examples of names it previously had gotten wrong. When that topic peters out she moves to, ""I just need to get $100 so I can quit for the night.""

I try to be responsive and say, ""well that's kinda nice that you only have to work until you meet your goal!"" Immediately she gets into the soliloquy about how her daughter asks for money all the time and never puts her back. Trying to steer the conversation off without too much obviousness. I ask her how many children she has. She responds, ""TOO MANY!!! Too, too, many!! TOO MANY!"" I uncomfortably laugh and say, ""so.... 2?"" This is where shit gets uncomfortable and weird.

Immediately she says her son is fine, he never asks for anything and is doing ok. But reiterated how her daughter basically steals from her. Again, trying desperately to end this awkwardness, I tell her that I'm sure she her daughter appreciates her. Wrong approach apparently. She goes OFF. I mean just OFF. About how terrible her daughter is.

Here are the worst of the things she said.
1) Over and over again she said, ""I don't owe her nothing! She owes me everything!""
2) I could have had an illegal abortion, she should be lucky to be in this world.
3) I could have left her on the door step of the church, but instead I took care of her and raised her- she should be grateful!

You get the idea. I mean just terrible, terrible things. I couldn't believe that another human would think these things, let alone verbalized them to complete strangers AND it's about their own child.Inside I was thinking about al my friends who are being torn apart by the adoption process and wanted to yell at her that her daughter might have been better off being adopted by a loving and caring home with enough love to go around and wouldn't see the child as a burden.

225,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I've been lurking on this sub for about a year now, but haven't posted yet.  Mostly because we have only been at this for 18mths (although at 38, we don't have a super long time to try), but also because even with surgeries, chlomid, gonal-f shots, and IUI, I still want more that anything for this not to be true, and participating makes it way too true. (TL;DR at bottom)

Short as can be intro of shit I've been through so far, we started trying as soon as we were married in Sept of 2014. Was already 36, so immediately dived into monitors and charting, and for the most part everything seemed cyclically okay.  Short of a little spotting here and there, so with six month of no results we went to obgyn. Im an avid googler and in my mind blocked tubes seemed like the likely culprit, but when they did the ultrasound they said blood was outside my uterus and had a little growth of some sort that was not a big deal compared to the dreaded Endo.  They got me an appt at specialist in 30 days and gave me a pamphlet on Endo.  Thanks guys!

So my googling begins, starting with specialist. This would be the one and only time I ever requested to use a different specialist.  I'm not sure if I made the right choice since I never went to him, but all his reviews, rather glowing or bashing, mentioned he was a man of strong religious conviction, so much so that even those that shared that conviction were a little thrown.  I am not religious, I do live in the Bible Belt, and while usually to each his own, when it comes to fertility treatments and the emotions attached, not to mention some religious opinions about certain things made me really uncomfortable, and I immediately switched.  Irrelevant, but I thought worth mentioning and didn't know if others had experience either positively or negatively this this. 

So, after thirty days of reading the gloom and doom of Endo, I go see the specialist I chose and she explained they had misinterpreted ultrasound.  The growth, with they had mention secondary and even said it may not need to be removed, was actually three growths that had combined, making one pretty massive 9cm sphere of mass (it wasn't a tumor or a cyst and proved to be benign, but never know what to call it). So picture a sphere with about a 3-1/2"" diameter, and this was pushing blood outside uterine lining and twisting my tubes, one real bad, one not so bad.  The only treatment option that ended with me being able to carry a child (I will by default have to have c-section) is a myomectomy, a procedure that used to be terrible, then laparoscopy made not so bad, but recent discovery about laparoscopic procedure made them go back to terrible version....Yay Me!

So two straight months on letrazole to shrink growth and 3 months of recovery time and we are ready to start trying for real.  Bad new is is procedure we lost one tube, so we are not great, but still doable.  So we do low dose chlomid.  Not that many eggs, and on wrong ovary, no worries, up dose and although not a rule, usually ovaries tend to alternate.  Next month same thing, maybe let's try some injectables.  And what now seems to be the norm, few eggs on wrong ovary, only now they are worried, so few eggs with injectables is just not right. So a few more fucked cycles like that and we come down to this: IVF with your egg 10-15% success as highest that can give.  So I had looked into donor eggs, and since I've been reassured time and time again it's just eggs and tubes, donor eggs seem ideal.  We had looked at adoption, so not being genetically mine, while a bummer, I was okay with it. 

**So this is where shit gets kinda weird.  I tell my mom and sis this, we are a close family, now.  Prior to my sis and I being born, my mom gave up two kids for adoption, but they are both back in out life, and while its takes a bit of adjusting, we are all excited about more family to love (trust me this is relevant).  So, newly found out about half-sis also is informed of decision to do donor eggs, and she passed info on to newly found half brother about same situation. This wasn't done gossipy, this was done because, honestly, my default is to just share with the same two people I have for 36 years, I don't intentionally, but I sometimes forget to include. So, for example, when talking about donor eggs if an RE says to me do you have any younger siblings or relatives to donate eggs, I may forget that I in fact have an 18 year old niece.  I mean I only met her once, and why she was darling and sweet, I forget these things.  She, however, is more aware, and more kind hearted than I ever dreamed, and she actually offered to donate eggs for us, and as of right now this is the plan.

So, that's my intro, sorry if makes little sense.  I felt the need to finally reach out and participate today because it's one of those day I feel so lost and hopeless. My niece went for her initial appointment, but since we are a 2000 miles apart, I haven't met all the doctors where we are going to be doing it.  I don't know a time frame or a cost stricture and feel absolutely lost.  I can't get a hold of anyone and they had planned on the whole process being done in June or July.  I kinda have felt like this the entire time, even with my RE.  I felt like a plan of attack, like try this, if this fails try this then, is never given to me.  Everything is just up in the air at all times.  Am I not asking the right questions to pin down what I need?  My mother in law, who I love dearly but micromanages shit to death, I had sit in on consult trying to use that skill, but she's still unsure....eh.

Sorry for the wall of text, before my TL;DR I just wanted to know what people experiences, if anyone has any, with known donors.  I'm seeing a therapist who has helped me see my feelings of guilt with my niece donating and my in-laws paying, and kinda unbox and deal with those.  But the aftermath, after the child is born, and having the donor be in their life, but as cousin not mom, or uncle not grandpa, it's all so abstract until suddenly it won't be.

TL;DR: Year long struggle with trying to get pregnant, will end up using donor eggs, was going to be anon, but I forgot that my mother had a son she gave up for adoption who is now reunited with a daughter who is 18 and willing to donate.

I am not religious, I do live in the Bible Belt, and while usually to each his own, when it comes to fertility treatments and the emotions attached, not to mention some religious opinions about certain things made me really uncomfortable, and I immediately switched.  Irrelevant, but I thought worth mentioning and didn&#39;t know if others had experience either positively or negatively this this. </p>

<p>So, after thirty days of reading the gloom and doom of Endo, I go see the specialist I chose and she explained they had misinterpreted ultrasound.  The growth, with they had mention secondary and even said it may not need to be removed, was actually three growths that had combined, making one pretty massive 9cm sphere of mass (it wasn&#39;t a tumor or a cyst and proved to be benign, but never know what to call it). So picture a sphere with about a 3-1/2&quot; diameter, and this was pushing blood outside uterine lining and twisting my tubes, one real bad, one not so bad.  The only treatment option that ended with me being able to carry a child (I will by default have to have c-section) is a myomectomy, a procedure that used to be terrible, then laparoscopy made not so bad, but recent discovery about laparoscopic procedure made them go back to terrible version....Yay Me!</p>

<p>So two straight months on letrazole to shrink growth and 3 months of recovery time and we are ready to start trying for real.  Bad new is is procedure we lost one tube, so we are not great, but still doable.  So we do low dose chlomid.  Not that many eggs, and on wrong ovary, no worries, up dose and although not a rule, usually ovaries tend to alternate.  Next month same thing, maybe let&#39;s try some injectables.  And what now seems to be the norm, few eggs on wrong ovary, only now they are worried, so few eggs with injectables is just not right. So a few more fucked cycles like that and we come down to this: IVF with your egg 10-15% success as highest that can give.  So I had looked into donor eggs, and since I&#39;ve been reassured time and time again it&#39;s just eggs and tubes, donor eggs seem ideal.  We had looked at adoption, so not being genetically mine, while a bummer, I was okay with it. </p>

<p>**So this is where shit gets kinda weird.  I tell my mom and sis this, we are a close family, now.  Prior to my sis and I being born, my mom gave up two kids for adoption, but they are both back in out life, and while its takes a bit of adjusting, we are all excited about more family to love (trust me this is relevant).  So, newly found out about half-sis also is informed of decision to do donor eggs, and she passed info on to newly found half brother about same situation. This wasn&#39;t done gossipy, this was done because, honestly, my default is to just share with the same two people I have for 36 years, I don&#39;t intentionally, but I sometimes forget to include. So, for example, when talking about donor eggs if an RE says to me do you have any younger siblings or relatives to donate eggs, I may forget that I in fact have an 18 year old niece.  I mean I only met her once, and why she was darling and sweet, I forget these things.  She, however, is more aware, and more kind hearted than I ever dreamed, and she actually offered to donate eggs for us, and as of right now this is the plan.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s my intro, sorry if makes little sense.  I felt the need to finally reach out and participate today because it&#39;s one of those day I feel so lost and hopeless. My niece went for her initial appointment, but since we are a 2000 miles apart, I haven&#39;t met all the doctors where we are going to be doing it.  I don&#39;t know a time frame or a cost stricture and feel absolutely lost.  I can&#39;t get a hold of anyone and they had planned on the whole process being done in June or July.  I kinda have felt like this the entire time, even with my RE.  I felt like a plan of attack, like try this, if this fails try this then, is never given to me.  Everything is just up in the air at all times.  Am I not asking the right questions to pin down what I need?  My mother in law, who I love dearly but micromanages shit to death, I had sit in on consult trying to use that skill, but she&#39;s still unsure....eh.</p>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text, before my TL;DR I just wanted to know what people experiences, if anyone has any, with known donors.  I&#39;m seeing a therapist who has helped me see my feelings of guilt with my niece donating and my in-laws paying, and kinda unbox and deal with those.  But the aftermath, after the child is born, and having the donor be in their life, but as cousin not mom, or uncle not grandpa, it&#39;s all so abstract until suddenly it won&#39;t be.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Year long struggle with trying to get pregnant, will end up using donor eggs, was going to be anon, but I forgot that my mother had a son she gave up for adoption who is now reunited with a daughter who is 18 and willing to donate. They live across states and ATM frustrated with trying to deal with clinic, but curious about anyone that used known donor eggs.</p>

Last week, I had an ultrasound done. Everything is OK except my right ovary which is multifollicular. My follicles grows in numbers, but never matures. Ok, so my doctor prescribed clomid which I'm supposed to take as soon as I start a new cycle.

What makes me wonders, is why my AMH is low (1.15 and I'm 26 yrs old) if I have a lot of follicles growing ? It doesn't seems to make any sense to me. 

Is clomid a good treatment with multifollicular ovary ? My doctor doesn't think it's necessary to supervise my cycles and told me to come back to him in 3 month if I'm not pregnant.

I see a lot of people with PCOS, but no one with multifollicular ovary, does it have another acronym ?

231,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"sorry for the wall of text. I'm really upset right now and this is how I'm trying to deal with it.

A couple months ago, my IVF attempt failed when I decided to ovulate through my ovulation antagonist drug. What I didn't share at the time was that I got home after my clinic appointment and bawled my eyes out. My husband was nice about all that, we didn't really talk - he just sort of held onto me until I stopped crying. It was a hard day, really, I was exhausted by that point.

Honestly I felt finished with the whole effort afterward. For what reason would I do IVF again?? but it's funny that after a couple months I felt a little better and agreed to go back to the clinic to talk about one last go with my husband and Doctor.

While my husband and I were in the consult, after reviewing the result of the last IVF failure, my husband mentioned that I had actually taken the failed IVF pretty hard, and also that the toll on me was high due to the way I ""heavily invested emotionally"" into the procedure. My Doc agreed ""you mean like, she gets obsessed? yeah. that's pretty common."" They exchanged a couple more words about how the IVF mums can go through a lot and get a little crazy. My husband nodded his head and laughed. I wanted to punch him in the face. The doctor gave me the clinic counsellors card and smiled compassionately, suggested we give her a call for supportive services. I wanted to punch her in the face also.

There I was sitting, trying not to burst into tears - something I am not prone to doing, particularly in public, and ready to strangle him for saying that. After we left I told him I was upset by that whole exchange and he apologized but admitted he couldn't understand why - he said we all need help sometimes and I've chosen to endure something emotionally difficult and I should not be above admitting when I need help coping. I had a hard time explaining it myself, actually.

I told him it's because he just effectively diminished me, cast me as ""the crazy lady""or the fragile patient to be baby-sat. I told him I don't appreciate being cast in this way in light of what I have tried to do, and the weight I have carried for three failed procedures and counting.  I explained that from all sides, I realize that I feel threatened when I go through these procedures. And who is there to lift me up and tell me I'm doing great? NO ONE. Instead I get treated like I'm ""fragile"" or obsessed, encouraged to not ""get too wrapped up"" despite the daily regimen involved and the fact that my world gets turned upside down every time I go through a procedure. 

My work loses patience as I take off all sorts of time for appointments I can't even be honest about. Physically, I inject and endure the daily rigor of the cramps, side effects and ultrasounds. Mentally, I endure the toll of the potential results - knowing any result will be a lot to process and to bear. On top of that I endure the watching, monitoring and interpreting of the clinic and the staff and their tests, waiting for their call and wondering if they've done things correct, enduring all the procedures not to mention getting the run around pretty regularly which I expect is probably par for the course. 

It's exhausting, and the worst part is the way my husband talks to me - telling me not to get my hopes up, reminding me to shift my focus, losing patience with me when I try to talk to him about things ""too much"" while he sits in his fucking ivory tower getting off scot free and treating me like he's tolerating me. I walk on eggshells, trying not to relay to much emotional investment, trying to take things in stride, so as not to be coddled and reprimanded by him for ""getting my hopes up"" or ""becoming obsessive"" while noticing how bored be becomes with the details I've waited to share all day.

I asked my husband: what positive thing has come out of any of this that I should want to ever do it again?? I feel diminished when I do these things - not elevated. I feel smaller, more like a patient than like his partner. I asked him why I should ever want to do it again given how awful and anxious I feel every time I try. We have like, a 5% chance of a baby if we try again, yet I have a 100% chance of feeling this way if I do it - anxious, worried, hopeful, obsessed, stressed out, and overwhelmed by the sum of these things.

Listening to him talk about me like that today - I just wanted to strangle him. How inconvenient it must all be for him to have to endure the ""obsessive"" musings of his emotional wife. Fucking prick.

I feel pretty confused right now. Has anyone here been through anything like this? Is this how men normally act - am I being over sensitive, or is my husband actually an asshole in this situation?

I'm a male who was diagnosed with non-obstructive azoospermia out of the blue back in February. We are extremely fortunate in that we were able to afford FNA Mapping (a purely diagnostic procedure to see the quality and amount of sperm in the testis). If it went well then we would move on to doing microdissection on me and IVF + ICSI.

But a few hours ago we got the results and unfortunately they came back negative: 0 sperm. Cells go through 12 stages on their way to sperm, and mine arrest after reaching the 5th stage. The doctor said that this is genetic, but it's a category that hasn't been discovered yet. In 10 years they will probably have sequenced whatever gene causes this, and there will probably be a name and a test for it. But for right now it's just an unknown. There is no treatment.

I don't really know what I'm hoping to get out of posting this, other than this is the worst day of my life and, well, I don't know, I just want to talk about it with people. Even if it's just posting online.

We don't know what we're going to do. Right now we're just mourning what feels like the death of my imagined son/daughter. I'm starting to set up conversations with people who have adopted or had donor sperm to learn what their experience has been like. I know that many people are happy with adoption but we really wanted to just have a little version of me. Maybe that's selfish, I don't know. I feel hyper sensitive now to people in public saying things like ""Wow your soon looks just like you!"" or ""blood relative"" etc etc.

I guess when my wife and I first started having trouble conceiving then I didn't worry about it because I thought to myself, ""This isn't the '80's. There are hundreds of interventions we can do before the worst happens."" I never thought we would fall straight through the floor so fast. Maybe in a way it's a blessing that we weren't slogging through this for years. But right now it just hurts.

Anyway, like I said, not sure the purpose of posting this. I guess I just want to talk. Thanks so much for reading. I pray all of you have better success.

If it went well then we would move on to doing microdissection on me and IVF + ICSI.</p>

<p>But a few hours ago we got the results and unfortunately they came back negative: 0 sperm. Cells go through 12 stages on their way to sperm, and mine arrest after reaching the 5th stage. The doctor said that this is genetic, but it&#39;s a category that hasn&#39;t been discovered yet. In 10 years they will probably have sequenced whatever gene causes this, and there will probably be a name and a test for it. But for right now it&#39;s just an unknown. There is no treatment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m hoping to get out of posting this, other than this is the worst day of my life and, well, I don&#39;t know, I just want to talk about it with people. Even if it&#39;s just posting online.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know what we&#39;re going to do. Right now we&#39;re just mourning what feels like the death of my imagined son/daughter. I&#39;m starting to set up conversations with people who have adopted or had donor sperm to learn what their experience has been like. I know that many people are happy with adoption but we really wanted to just have a little version of me. Maybe that&#39;s selfish, I don&#39;t know. I feel hyper sensitive now to people in public saying things like &quot;Wow your soon looks just like you!&quot; or &quot;blood relative&quot; etc etc.</p>

<p>I guess when my wife and I first started having trouble conceiving then I didn&#39;t worry about it because I thought to myself, &quot;This isn&#39;t the &#39;80&#39;s. There are hundreds of interventions we can do before the worst happens.&quot; I never thought we would fall straight through the floor so fast. Maybe in a way it&#39;s a blessing that we weren&#39;t slogging through this for years. But right now it just hurts.</p>

<p>Anyway, like I said, not sure the purpose of posting this. I guess I just want to talk. Thanks so much for reading. I pray all of you have better success.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thank you so much for all the responses. It&#39;s helpful also to hear from others who have gone through this. I&#39;m not sure how right now but we&#39;ll survive.</p>

I went to the hospital that afternoon as I was concerned about ectopic due to the (mild) pain on one side and the beta at the hospital was 755 (down from about 1300 that morning at the Clinic). Thursday I saw the on call OBGYN (referred by the hospital) and she felt it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy but a collapsing corpus luteum. On Friday, my clinic did another beta to confirm the miscarriage (had dropped to about 300). I stopped my endometrin that morning. Since then, I have had occasional, mild cramping and light bleeding (pantyliner is all that's needed). I have been off work since Wed. morning and was planning to go back tomorrow, but now that the full bleeding hasn't started yet, I don't know if I should just stay home and wait so I am somewhere comfortable and familiar when it starts or if I should go in and just leave if/when the bleeding starts. I have read online that sometimes it can take a week or two for the bleeding to really start. 

Does anyone have any knowledge of what and when I can expect everything to start? I'm sorry if this was the wrong place to post this.
