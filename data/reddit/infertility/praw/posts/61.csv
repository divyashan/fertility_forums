12,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I’m finding it really hard to be in this moment of my life.  The only way I can describe it is by calling it hell.  I feel like a failure.  And I’m angry.  3 IVF cycles, only 2 embryos frozen, and both came back PGS abnormal earlier this week.

I’m working with my therapist to process the grief and love myself through this. I even googled living children with these chromosome abnormalities to find some sort of peace with it.  But I’m still struggling moving into acceptance and I feel stuck.

I finally received the official genetic test report yesterday and was able to see with my own eyes everything I had worked so hard for this past year.  The hope to keep trying after 2 losses.  The strength to accept our diagnosis: DOR and genetic carriers.  The patience to wait months for a genetic test probe to be built.  The will to build myself back up after our first cycle failed.  The relief of having 1 embryo frozen in both of our 2nd and 3rd cycles.  And the worry of only having 1 embryo frozen in both of our 2nd and 3rd cycles.

Our first embryo frozen was almost perfect, too.  It was frozen on day 5 and was graded 4AA.  I remember the day I got the news and how I sobbed with relief.  That cycle we only had 2 eggs retrieved.  And it was supposed to be the better cycle, since we had changed protocols.  The depression, the fear, the bravery to forge on despite such low odds.

Our second embryo frozen was also graded AA but was frozen on Day 6.  So if either of them was going to be abnormal, I was expecting this one to be the one.

After finally looking at the report yesterday, I started with our first embryo.  I saw Chr-1 = 2 meaning there were 2 copies of chromosome 1 which meant it was good / normal.  Then I continued down the report.  Chr-2 = 2, Chr-3 = 2, so on and so forth until I got to the very last one.  Chr-22.  There were 3 copies.  It was absolutely perfect until the very last chromosome...

I don’t know if the process of meiosis has the chromosomes matching up in chronological order or not.  But I like to think that the extra chromosome 22 was cheering the other ones along and the other ones wouldn’t have been so perfect without it.  

I wish we had gotten better news, because I’m so ready to share better news.  We still have coverage for 1 more retrieval, but I don’t know if we should do it.  Part of me feels guilty for not wanting to do it just because of how many people don’t have infertility coverage.  We’d have to pay another $1800 to freeze our embryo(s) as well as testing fees.  And in the grand scheme of things it’s just another drop in the bucket really.  But Im just getting back into my gym / nutrition routine and don’t want to stop again.  I don’t want to pump my body full of hormones again.  There is a different protocol we can try that Dr. Sher recommends for DOR patients.  It’s called the antagonist / agonist conversion protocol.  But I want to hear what my RE says about it first.  I have an appt at the end of this month to discuss.  Who knows.  This is my least favorite option.  What if this fails too?

Been thinking a lot about donor embryos lately too.  The idea of sending an announcement to our family and friends that says:  We’re adopting...and we’re pregnant!  sounds exciting.  But not sure how to navigate the child’s feelings when he or she gets older.  Would they feel like there is a piece of themselves missing without knowing who their parents were?  

And then the other thought that’s been creeping in is to live child free.  The idea of being able to sleep in, do what I want, when I want sounds amazing.  I mean...that is my life right now, of course, minus the heartache.  This option has me facing serious personal beliefs about myself that I’ve been conditioned to believe though.  And  I’m not quite comfortable facing these beliefs just yet.  What is my life if I’m not a mom?  How will I connect to others if I don’t have children?  How will I be happy without children?  

I guess I’m going to have to sit in the grief awhile longer before the right answer comes to me.  

Just writing this post feels therapeutic.  Thanks for letting me get my thoughts out and always being there to support me.

<p>I’m working with my therapist to process the grief and love myself through this. I even googled living children with these chromosome abnormalities to find some sort of peace with it.  But I’m still struggling moving into acceptance and I feel stuck.</p>

<p>I finally received the official genetic test report yesterday and was able to see with my own eyes everything I had worked so hard for this past year.  The hope to keep trying after 2 losses.  The strength to accept our diagnosis: DOR and genetic carriers.  The patience to wait months for a genetic test probe to be built.  The will to build myself back up after our first cycle failed.  The relief of having 1 embryo frozen in both of our 2nd and 3rd cycles.  And the worry of only having 1 embryo frozen in both of our 2nd and 3rd cycles.</p>

<p>Our first embryo frozen was almost perfect, too.  It was frozen on day 5 and was graded 4AA.  I remember the day I got the news and how I sobbed with relief.  That cycle we only had 2 eggs retrieved.  And it was supposed to be the better cycle, since we had changed protocols.  The depression, the fear, the bravery to forge on despite such low odds.</p>

<p>Our second embryo frozen was also graded AA but was frozen on Day 6.  So if either of them was going to be abnormal, I was expecting this one to be the one.</p>

<p>After finally looking at the report yesterday, I started with our first embryo.  I saw Chr-1 = 2 meaning there were 2 copies of chromosome 1 which meant it was good / normal.  Then I continued down the report.  Chr-2 = 2, Chr-3 = 2, so on and so forth until I got to the very last one.  Chr-22.  There were 3 copies.  It was absolutely perfect until the very last chromosome...</p>

<p>I don’t know if the process of meiosis has the chromosomes matching up in chronological order or not.  But I like to think that the extra chromosome 22 was cheering the other ones along and the other ones wouldn’t have been so perfect without it.  </p>

<p>I wish we had gotten better news, because I’m so ready to share better news.  We still have coverage for 1 more retrieval, but I don’t know if we should do it.  Part of me feels guilty for not wanting to do it just because of how many people don’t have infertility coverage.  We’d have to pay another $1800 to freeze our embryo(s) as well as testing fees.  And in the grand scheme of things it’s just another drop in the bucket really.  But Im just getting back into my gym / nutrition routine and don’t want to stop again.  I don’t want to pump my body full of hormones again.  There is a different protocol we can try that Dr. Sher recommends for DOR patients.  It’s called the antagonist / agonist conversion protocol.  But I want to hear what my RE says about it first.  I have an appt at the end of this month to discuss.  Who knows.  This is my least favorite option.  What if this fails too?</p>

<p>Been thinking a lot about donor embryos lately too.  The idea of sending an announcement to our family and friends that says:  We’re adopting...and we’re pregnant!  sounds exciting.  But not sure how to navigate the child’s feelings when he or she gets older.  Would they feel like there is a piece of themselves missing without knowing who their parents were?  </p>

<p>And then the other thought that’s been creeping in is to live child free.  The idea of being able to sleep in, do what I want, when I want sounds amazing.  I mean...that is my life right now, of course, minus the heartache.  This option has me facing serious personal beliefs about myself that I’ve been conditioned to believe though.  And  I’m not quite comfortable facing these beliefs just yet.  What is my life if I’m not a mom?  How will I connect to others if I don’t have children?  How will I be happy without children?  </p>

<p>I guess I’m going to have to sit in the grief awhile longer before the right answer comes to me.  </p>

<p>Just writing this post feels therapeutic.  Thanks for letting me get my thoughts out and always being there to support me.  </p>

\- Had a handful of excruciating periods when I was much younger; always tended to be quite crampy

\- Used to get light cramping feeling about 7-10 days out from period (up until 2 years ago)

\- Heavy periods (this is a guess as I don't measure anything), but tend to only last 4 days (rarely a light 5th day)

\- Have a retroverted uterus

\- Previous infertility and current infertility

\- Had a small cyst (less than 2 mm) on an ovary during AFC, 

\- Get shooting dull ache type pain (not sharp nor do they hurt much) in rectum area sometimes between ovulation and period cessation (not frequent)

My periods are no longer really painful at all, nor do I get cramping more than a day or two before my period now, but I had a c-section one year ago and am not sure how much of that is due to numbness remaining in the area. Istill have a few spots along the incision line externally that have almost no feeling/no feeling, so can only guess a similar situation is going on internally.

I have mentioned all of this to both my OBGYN and RE in the past. OBGYN said she didn't feel any indication of it, and brushed off everything else (retroverted uterus can be normal, had natural conception after infertility struggle, regular periods, only 4 days long etc.). She also mentioned that she hadn't seen anything to indicate endometriosis when she did the c-section (scarring/adhesions etc.), but at the same time they are working quick and not taking a scenic tour around the pelvic region during a c-section so I'm not sure it is something they even \*would\* notice. RE said the cyst was so small it was likely something to do with what side I was going to ovulate from? Not sure how a cyst ties in, but she did not seem concerned in the slightest. RE did not feel endometriosis should be on the table as part of why I was having infertility issues.

My question is, what steps should I be taking from here with OBGYN and RE to follow up on this more? Are they likely to order a laparoscopy if they have dismissed in the past? Am I overreacting thinking this may be playing into my fertility struggles?

23,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi,

I figured, as I start being more involved, I should introduce myself.

I'm an ER doctor in California. My wife is an RE in California. I've been following this blog for a couple years, passively, mainly to gain an understanding of the frustrations women (and men) go through during these stressful months and years.

A little background: As an ER doctor, I see people on their worst days. I give people bad news all the time: there's a mass on your pancreas that we need to workup, your husband of 40 years died today, you're having a heart attack.

In my 7 years, though, miscarraige remains the hardest bad news to break. Watching the anticipation and the joy of a pregnancy, followed by the apprehension of the complication that brought the patient to the ER, followed by delivering the bad news which leads to an overwhelming, heart-crushing sense of loss. 

Every time, it weighs on me. 

My wife has a very different perspective. As an RE, she sees all of these complications of pregnancy, and many more. But she sees the joy and the determination of resolve of her patients. She's vicariously a part of their battle, and gets to help women and couples through to their success. I believe it is these successes that grow her passion for the work she does, and the compassion she has for her patients. 

We have different perspectives on the issues of fertility. Ultimately, though, I am the redditor, but I'm always chatting with her about what I read here. I figured I should start chiming in.

Obviously, we don't want to step on your RE's toes, So I'll always avoid commenting in a manner that may seem like providing medical recommendations. Your story and history is unique to you and far more complex than a reddit post. It would be improper and foolish for me to make comments that are interpreted as medical recommendations. The last thing I would want a patient to say to their RE is, ""well, a doctor who is married to an RE told me on reddit I should try [xyz]!"" Ultimately, I'm not your doctor and I can't provide you medical advice over reddit. I am, of course, happy to help explain or expound, in my own voice but with my wife's knowledge, the whats and whys of how things are going on. I'm happy to commiserate, too. Maybe I'll get my wife to contribute directly once she figures out reddit!!

I'd also want to continue learning from this community. I read a lot about frustration of the interactions of this community with friends and family. Conversations that cut deep because of your underlying struggle. I know both my wife and I want to be compassionate providers, and I think the insight of the unfiltered conversation that takes place here.

<p>I figured, as I start being more involved, I should introduce myself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an ER doctor in California. My wife is an RE in California. I&#39;ve been following this blog for a couple years, passively, mainly to gain an understanding of the frustrations women (and men) go through during these stressful months and years.</p>

<p>A little background: As an ER doctor, I see people on their worst days. I give people bad news all the time: there&#39;s a mass on your pancreas that we need to workup, your husband of 40 years died today, you&#39;re having a heart attack.</p>

<p>In my 7 years, though, miscarraige remains the hardest bad news to break. Watching the anticipation and the joy of a pregnancy, followed by the apprehension of the complication that brought the patient to the ER, followed by delivering the bad news which leads to an overwhelming, heart-crushing sense of loss. </p>

Any help would be tremendously appreciated.

42,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Someone was asking in chat about which needles were which and it reminded me of a conversation a month ago when someone else was asking similar so I thought I'd try to capture the gist of it all.  Other experts, please feel free to chime in here!

There are mixing needles, subq needles, IM needles, q-caps, pen needle caps, and syringes.

The q-caps are used with a syringe to puncture vials and withdraw liquid and/or add liquid to another vial.  You can't inject with them ;) (it's obvious when you see one).

Pen needle caps screw on to multi-dose pens so you can use a new needle tip each time you inject.

Now the fun stuff...

Subcutaneous (subq) injections are the ones that go in to the fatty layer under the skin, not in to the muscle.  These are commonly given in the lower belly (bellow the belly button).  The needles are normally only 0.5"" long.  The needle gauge\* is normally 27-30g.  This is most of the IVF medications.  

Intra-muscular (IM) injections are the ones that go in to the muscle (past the fatty layer).  These injections are commonly given in the glutes (upper butt area) or the outer thigh.  The needles are normally 1.5"" long.  The needle gauge\* is normally 20-22g for IVF, but could vary based on the fluid.  Progesterone in oil (PIO) is a thick fluid so the needle gauge needs to be larger to move it through which is why PIO is such a pain in the ass ;)

Mixing needles are wider needles used to pull fluid in to a syringe quickly.  They are normally 1.5"" long also.  For withdrawing PIO the needle could be as large as 18g.  For thinner fluids they could be in the 20-22g range.  To use a mixing needle, you put it on a syringe, draw up the fluid, mixing with another vial if needed, and then draw all the desired fluid in to the syringe.  You then cap and twist off the mixing needle and put the appropriate injection needle on the syringe.

The bottom line is that the most important thing is the length of the needle, not the gauge.  The length determines which tissue layer the medication is deposited in and that impacts it's absorption rate.  Some medications can be done either way and the clinic will have a preference.  If you use a needle that is bigger/wider than necessary (but the right length) it will hurt more and inject very quickly (shouldn't be an issue).  If you use a needle that is smaller than recommended (but the right length) it could take FOREVER to get the fluid to inject (also should not be an issue).  

 \* The gauge is the diameter for the needle.  Remember the larger the gauge the smaller the needle, and vise versa. (Which never made sense to me because then what is 0g?  infinitely large?)

But my family is now navigating two different cases of infertility and I need some guidance. shoot me down if I'm being judgey because this is my brother and I'm being protective. My brother seems to be joinging the infertility club, voluntarily.

I was talking to my  younger brother about how this getting pregnant thing is not happening. He was generally ""that sucks"" and trying to cheer me up without attaching any blame. He loves kids and wants them too. He and his fiancee have for a very long time said that they want to use a surogate. My FSIL has got a lot of physical and mental issues and therefore taking a lot of drugs that she should not stop but would be harmful to a fetus. I think I freaked my brother out because I was telling him to start saving now because it is going to be hella expensive. I outlined the steps of how it would have to go, basically the stimming, retrival, transfer, the legal aspect. Each of these steps costs a lot of money with insurance and for them it would be voluntary and therefore out of pocket. I also told him about success rates and how much it costs per try. He seemed to think that if it was a friend that offered to be their surogate and since FSILs family is very fertile that it would be cheap and easy peasy. That was the end of our conversation.

My brother makes ok money, and the fiancee works part time with little chance for growth. She is very dependent on him. The cost to do what he is talking about is at minimum what he makes in a year.

I don't know how to feel about this. My brother has always wanted kids, even in high school he would be making up the names of his future children. He does not want to adopt. His fiancee has always said she would not be physically having any children. I have said for a long time that she needs to be in an inpatient facility for a while to get her health straightened out since she has issues with substance dependence. She takes antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, ADD meds, smokes pot and takes sleeping pills because the ADD meds keep her awake. She dr shops and to her everything can be solved with pills and modern medicine. She's also a vegetarian and has a pretty poor diet, think green salad with a redbull and vodka. I think a lot of her health issues could be addressed with diet changes, therapy to develop healthy coping skills and a detox to a simpler medication plan, but that is a big effort and no one is going force her to do that.  So yes it it her choice to not ever want to have children, but they are getting married this year and I feel that it is a very fundemental difference that is going to impact his long term happiness.

I am a little worried because I thought RE would decide the meds dosage depending on amh and fsh level.  Also depending if you have pcos or not.

<p>When the test was done August 2017 , amh was 28.2 ( that&#39;s right . it is 28 not 2.8  and I am in US in case you are wondering about the measurement) . 
Fsh was 7.7 
Even though I have very high amh for my age, my RE doesn&#39;t think I have pcos ( I haven&#39;t done any test to find out if I havr pcos or not ) and I don&#39;t have to redo the test since it is done less than a year ago ( 11 months ago to be exact).</p>

<p>I am a little worried because I thought RE would decide the meds dosage depending on amh and fsh level.  Also depending if you have pcos or not.  I feel like he should have me do some other test done before he decides dosage. I haven&#39;t even seen the doc in person because I am in Alaska and the clinic is in Seattle.  I had only 2 phone conferences.  Am I overly worried or is this pretty normal?</p>

Past contributor here under a different name many, many moons ago and ended up becoming one of those ""long-time lurkers"". 

Well, today I break my silence once again. 

**Our history**: Husband and I have been together for about a decade. We ended up having a chemical miscarriage early in our relationship; never ended up pregnant again. After 3 years we decided to visit our REI clinic, where after running the routine tests, found that my uterus was in mint condition but my eggs were not. DOR was my prognosis. Around this time things were just not going the way we wanted in life. Hubby was supposed to get an SA done and never did - had no interest, whatsoever. I did one round of clomid and stored away everything baby-related in my life. Started going back to school; obtained a better job; purchased our first home, etc. etc.  

**Enter today**: In the last couple months we got to talking and agreed to *really* start trying again for baby #1 (after 46 cycles and counting - woof!). Because of my history, I knew I'd likely need to get tested again. CD3 was on July 6th; tests completed. Found out my levels haven't changed that much. My FSH went from 13.2 to 15.6 (after 3 years). 

And today we did Hubs first ever SA and were lucky enough to meet with our REI doctor, too. Great! *Then the news almost took the wind out of me -* **Hubs showed ZERO sperm**. Ouch... Universal ""uffdah"" moment. And all this time I thought it just might be something like that. We both looked at each other and laughed. Go figure, ha!

**Future state**: Doc REI laid out the next steps -  Have another SA done on Monday; get blood work and Genetic tesitng to find out what could be the cause \[done\]; asked about Hubs past - no situations in his life that would have caused this, so \*shrug\*. Thankfully Doc REI is awesome and also sent his recommendation to the #1 Urologist in our area. We also have a follow-up appointment to speak with one of the IVF specialists. 

While walking our pup this evening we talked about donor sperm and foster-to-adopt, so keeping things open. But boy - what a whopper of a day, ha! I'm just so thankful I have this man.

65,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So, I will provide a little background. About two years ago, shortly before my husband and I decided to start trying to have a baby, I made the decision to start seeing a therapist. I've had issues with anxiety on and off since I was a young kid, and while I've always been functional (I've never been crippled by my anxiety to the point that my life stops), I could tell that my anxiety was still affecting me in that I wasn't really fulfilling my full potential. Furthermore, at the time I also changed jobs to a higher stress job, was recently married and, eventhough my husband wasn’t yet fully on board with having baby, I knew I wanted a baby so I figured going to therapy would not only help me on a personal level, but it would also make me a better mother someday.

Fast forward to January 2018, this is when we got faced with my fertility issues. Suddenly most of my therapy sessions were no longer about personal growth or even about work-related stress, they became about my infertility and the difficulties attached to it. Then in April I once again began to get urinary tract infections (I was hospitalized for one a year ago). These infections have been a nightmare, there is no explanation as to why I keep getting them. I have been on antibiotics pretty much constantly since April. Even my urologist is perplexed. Then in June I had my laparoscopy during which I was diagnosed with Endometriosis. The surgery went well, my OB was confident that all will be fine once we start trying again. However, while I recover he has put me on suppressive medication (Aygestin) until September. Despite the good news coming out of surgery, I still haven’t been in the best mindset. Then to find out two weeks ago that the UTI I had pre-surgery is cleared, BUT a new one had taken its place just made me feel even worse. I feel like my body is giving up on me having a baby by refusing to stay healthy. And the Aygestin is only making matters worse. I have continued to go to my therapist and we have been able to work through a lot of it, but she now feels that with all that I am dealing with (which is A LOT) on top of the nasty side-effects from the medication (I am constantly in a bad mood), I could really benefit from taking a mild anti-depressant. She suggested I have my OB prescribe it so he can prescribe what he deems the safest in the event I get pregnant. I have done some research and see a lot of the common ones are pretty safe (i.e. low risk) during pregnancy, although most suggest they be discontinued in the third trimester. Considering that most of my mental issues are centered around the worry that I won’t be able to get pregnant, getting weaned off of the meds towards the end of my pregnancy, probably won’t be as bad. But I can only say that now obviously, I don’t know what it will be really like when the time comes. 

My OB is travelling so I am unable to speak to him until Monday. But I am afraid he will judge me for asking for anti-depressants. I know he is supposed to be a professional, but when I mentioned to him my anxiety when he prescribed the Aygestin, he just kind of dismissed it (I think he thought I was trying to refuse that particular treatment, which honestly I kind of was a little bit, but the anxiety was a legit concern. Now I see I wasn’t wrong to be concerned about it being a side effect although I have come to terms with the treatment and I am willing to continue to follow it through). So, I am afraid he will judge me and my capacity to be a good mother by asking for anti-depressants. I know there is no shame in it, but he has been the one doctor who has gotten the closest to be able to help me achieve my dream of motherhood. I don’t want him to back track on any of his plans or refuse to treat me because of my mental health. Honestly, if I wasn’t on the Aygestin, I am certain I wouldn’t be as down as I am, but the meds are clouding my mind. The only thing I have ever taken for my anxiety is a VERY low dose of Xanax that I take as needed. The last time I took any was about six months ago (or more), but since June I have taken it two or three times. The last time was last week, and after I took it my mind cleared and I felt so much better.

Full history:

* Conceived naturally in March 2014 after removing my non-hormonal IUI. Miscarried at 6 weeks.
* Tried another 6 months on our own, but I ovulate late and have a short luteal phase.
* Met with RE, got a diagnosis of mild lean PCOS.
* 11 cycles of letrozole + HCG trigger + TI = nothing.
* 3 IUIs = nothing.
* 1 egg retrieval which resulted in 4 PGS normal embryos.
* FET 1 = fail. Standard protocol (estrogen, PIO, steroid, antibiotic).
* Did an ERA biopsy, found to be pre-receptive, added another day of progesterone.
* FET 2 = fail. This cycle added letrozole.
* Did a laparoscopy to check for endo, minimal amounts found and removed.
* FET 3 = fail. This cycle included intralipids, letrozole, Claritin, Pepcid AC, extended steroid,  increased progesterone.

We’ve got 1 embryo left. We could do ERA again to double check we’re receptive, or we could do Receptiva. My understanding from my doctor is that if the Beta-3 integrin is off, it can prevent implantation. Considering we’ve only been pregnant once 3 years ago, clearly implantation is an issue. Not sure if Beta-3 integrin and the BCL6 levels are independent and if it still could be off despite removing those few small bits of endo.

The past two FETs have included letrozole, usually a treatment for low Beta-3 integrin and/or endo, so if the Receptiva test found anything I would do a few months of Depot Lupron. We’re already treating me as if I have immunological issues, and my doctor said we could test for them, but it’d be a few thousand dollars out of pocket and the protocol would not be very different. We'll be adding Lovenox this next FET because why not!?

I feel like I have a neon sign that reads “DESPERATE!!” on my forehead. I’m aware that I’m vulnerable to throwing money at anything that might help me get pregnant, but I don't have unlimited money, as IVF and these tests are entirely out of pocket. Any thoughts or experiences out there?

we're trying for #2 with a FET and we only have one embryo frozen. i'll be 35 in december, cycles are normal and all my hormones are good, nothing going on with me fertility-wise. husband has severe male factor infertility with unknown cause. ICSI is our only option for pregnancy, he has virtually no sperm, but luckily just enough to avoid surgical sperm retrieval. we talked with our RE yesterday about doing a completely natural FET with just an hcg trigger for timing and then the transfer--no progesterone or estrogen support since my levels are good. however, after talking, she encouraged me to do progesterone and estrogen supplementation during the two week wait and then, if my levels are high, wean off both if the (potential) pregnancy starts to make me produce enough hormones on my own. it seems like she would feel the *best* if i did 2 weeks of bc, trigger shot and then hormone support till 10 weeks pregnant, but she's willing to let me try this less-hormone-intensive option because of my personal preference.

has anyone ever done a protocol like this? how did it go? how long before you could wean off the hormones (or could you)? am i totally crazy to not just do the full hormone support? ivf made me feel really bad (as i'm sure everyone here knows) and i just want to avoid as many hormones as i can without sacrificing my one chance at pregnancy without going through another egg retrieval. it's hard to find good research on natural fet cycles vs. medicated because there haven't been good studies, just retrospective analysis. also, with MFI only i always feel it's hard to know what to do because it's a relatively rare diagnosis and so much of ivf outcome depends on factors with the woman. any thoughts would be appreciated. thank you!",[],False,,0,False,FET protocol options for MFI only,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8xz750,False,dark,0.8,,public,3,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,,False,False,,{},,False,3,,self,False,,{},,True,,1531341386.0,text,0,,,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>hey! i&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, this thread got me through our first (successful) round of ivf. thank you to everyone to who has shared their stories here. </p>

I'm needing some help determining if my CD 2 results are in range enough to expect at a moderately successful IVF cycle. My results were AMH 2.65 ng/mL, FSH 9.7 mIU/mL, estradiol 30.8 pg/mL. I am 26 years old.

My husband has virtual azoo (~100 sperm per sample) and on top of that, we can only transfer female embryos due to a male factor inheritable issue. Knowing that the embryos we get from a cycle will essentially be cut in half as soon as we do testing is making me very anxious about how many eggs we'll get from initial retrieval.

I have had three failed rounds of IVF, in which all eggs retrieved were immature. Here are my protocols:

**Round 1:**

Estradiol priming patches, Follistim 225IU, Menopur 75IU, Cetrotide 0.25mg. **Trigger was 450IU Follistim and HCG 5000IU**. 36 hour trigger.

*Follicles ranged in size from 16mm-20mm, and estrogen was 1525.*

9 eggs retrieved, all M1 (immature), 2 matured overnight and were ICSId, one fertilized and arrested on day 3.

**Round 2:** No priming, long lupron protocol with 10 units SQ, followed by Gonal F 225IU and Menopur 150IU and certitude 0.25mg. **Trigger was 450 IU Gonal F and HCG 5000IU. 38 hour trigger and delayed stripping.**

*Follicles ranged in size from 16-22mm, and estrogen was 2800.*

14 eggs retrieved, all M1, 7 matured overnight, none fertilized.

**Round 3:** New RE. No priming, mid-luteal start. 225IU Gonal F, 150IU Menopur, cetrotide 0.25mg, and human growth hormone 1.41mg. **Trigger was Lupron 4mg and HCG 20,000IU. 38 hour trigger with delayed stripping.**

*Follicles ranged in size from 14-20mm, and estrogen was 1475.*

8 eggs retrieved, all initially M1, but one spontaneously became M2 two hours after stripping. Three others were ICSId as M1, Currently have: 1 4 cell M2, 2 4 cell M1, and 1 12cell M1. Three of the embryos are only PN1, however, so not technically viable, most likely. :(

Has anyone else had this problem? I'm waiting to be tested for the TUBB8 mutation. I am also considering attempting another cycle with a longer stimulation period, in order to get my follicles to all measure a minimum of 20mm-28mm.

Would appreciate any insights, especially from RE's in this group.

Really appreciate the wiki and all the wisdom shared here, but could use some guidance getting my bearings on where to focus my research so that I’m well-equipped to be my own best advocate. 

I’m 37, husband is 45. We’re on our 10th cycle TTC #1. 24-27 day cycles, ovulation confirmed via OPK/temping,  very light 3-day periods. No previous pregnancies or MCs. His SA is normal, both our general health/weight are normal/average.

First RE consultation on CD16/7DPO: Ultrasound revealed corpus luteum, 3-4 follicles on each side, and a 4.8mm lining. He mentioned that he suspected I probably had a “low ovarian reserve” and that the thin lining lacking a layered structure wasn’t ideal. Described the thin lining as sort of a wild card factor that wasn’t a total barrier to pregnancy, but wasn’t helping either, and that there is nothing that can be medically done to affect it. 
 
TSH was 1.663, Prolactin 21.7. Other than CBC, infectious disease, and carrier screening (all normal/negative), those were the only values measured. There was no mention of obtaining Day 3 labs. 

HSG showed dye spilling from both tubes, but a “petite” uterus. RE seemed to lump tiny uterus into the same category as the lining. He “didn’t love it” but said it wasn’t necessarily a barrier. 

RE warned that with regular ol’ sex or IUI, low egg reserve leads to greater chance of chromosomal abnormality/miscarriage, and that a MC requiring D&C could lead to scarring on the thin lining that could feasibly render all other options impossible for me. Or that with low reserve, an IVF retrieval might not even be that successful. Now I just feel paralyzed. Halp!

IUI (covered by insurance) would be with letrozole rather than clomid due to the lining issue. But with regular ovulation, normal sperm, and being reasonably sure that we’ve been timing sex correctly, is there a reason to suspect that IUI would be beneficial, or would it just be a waste of time in our case? Can letrozole still thin your lining? 

IVF is not covered at all by our insurance. Logically this seems like the right way to go (?) but the cost is jaw-dropping. A friend in my same US-based major city paid $30k per round including meds and PGS testing, and I believe the cost would be similar at my clinic. Putting aside that silly dream of home ownership, we could swing maybe two rounds. But with my possibly crummy eggs and seemingly ramshackle uterine setup, it seems like such an unknown. Are there science-based things I can do in advance to set my eggs/body up for success to give us the best chance? I’d hate to go through with it, lose all our money, and then later learn doing X/Y/Z might have helped. But want to avoid woo-woo bullshit peddled to desperate women. Seems like a fine line. 

RE is very much of the “I give you the information, you make the decision” persuasion, which I appreciate, but I can’t help feeling like there’s gaping holes in the required information. We have a followup appointment Tuesday to discuss how to proceed. Based on previous conversations, I suspect he’ll first want to know whether we’ve decided to go with IUI or IVF. I understand this is the age-old question, but I don’t know how to get on with figuring it out. It’s unclear to me whether I even have an actual diagnosis.

Here’s the tldr version of our struggles: We have been not trying, not preventing since 2012 and actively trying since 2016. No pregnancies, just a few bum indents-that-look-like-positives. We went to an RE last year and I told I had unexplained infertility. He has no issues. I can post my panel results later if anyone wants to take a look at them. We’re shooting for meds and/or IUI by the end of 2018 if nothing happens by then.

I’ve been getting more comfortable in sharing this with friends and family and coworkers who ask. I’m all for the movement of opening up the conversation and I’ve made friends who are going through the same issues.

The problem is that now I’m getting people (usually ones who aren’t trying) who tell me things like, “It’s God’s plan,” or, “Maybe it would happen if you stopped trying so hard.” My solution is to kindly tell them that those words hurt and aren’t appreciated by anyone who is struggling. Someone this morning told me that they don’t believe the science that disqualifies these claims because of the mind-body connection. I’m tired of defending my reproductive system and I’m done with explaining the history of lifestyle changes that I’ve already tried.

To make matters worse I've been secretly setting money aside so if he leaves I am not destitute on top of things. I know this behavior, constant worry and bad decisions, will ultimately ruin my marriage. It's as if I am trying to make a mess of things to lessen the blow. It's messed up.

<p>I&#39;m also particularly interested to know how morning sickness was affected (if at all)? I had the pleasure of experiencing awful morning sickness with all my miscarriages and I&#39;m Soo not looking forward to suffering again, so I&#39;m curious to see if fixing my vitamin issue will somehow make the sickness easier? Idk wishful thinking I suppose.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any advice, experiences, stories, etc!</p>

207,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Last week I had my blood drawn for the Fertilome test, which looks at genetic markers for conditions associated with infertility. It's so new that I'm the first of my RE's patient to do it - and only because Fertilome gave my clinic a special discounted rate ($200 instead of the usual $1000!). I've been searching on here and can't find any other posts about the test, so I figured it might be useful to make a stand-alone post in case anyone else is thinking about it.

My RE just received the results today, and the news is interesting but not good:

1.  I have the genetic markers for Premature Ovarian Failure. 

2.  I'm also at ""moderate risk"" for implantation failure and repeated pregnancy loss, based on genetic markers for two things:
(a) Some sort of blood clotting/circulation problem and (b) A heightened immune response

3. I did *not* come up as high risk for endometriosis or PCOS.

The POF risk makes sense, since I already have DOR based on my AMH, FSH, and AFC. In a weird way, this is reassuring because I know there's nothing I could have done to cause or prevent it. (Aside from the tortured thoughts of ""why couldn't my husband and I have met five years sooner?"") There's nothing I ate, no toxins that I was exposed to; this is in my genes, and my ovaries were literally doomed from the start. What's really devastating, though, is the fear that this makes IVF even less likely to work - and that I'm now at risk of menopause before age 40. 

The risk of RPL also totally knocked the wind out of us. Why couldn't there just be one thing wrong? It makes sense though, given my autoimmune diseases (and osteopenia!) - and from the beginning, all three RE's I've consulted with basically said, ""science hasn't advanced enough to figure it out yet, but I bet your immune system is behind this.""

My RE said that if it weren't for my IBD, she'd put me on a baby aspirin for the clotting stuff. Since we can't do that, the vitamin E and methylfolate I'm already taking will have to suffice. 

In summary, I give Fertilome two very depressed thumbs-up. This doesn't change anything about our immediate plan (IVF attempt #2 ASAP), but it gives us some additional data points as we weigh how many times to try with my eggs before moving on. (And if this kind of information had been available 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago... I would have approached family planning a lot differently.)

UPDATE: DETAILED RESULTS
************************

I received a copy of my report, which is 11 pages long! It contains the same type/level of information that you receive from running 23andMe raw data through Promethease - it lists my particular genetic variants, describes the risks associated with them in layman's terms, and includes references for all of the associated research. (The difference is that it's focused on infertility, which is not part of the Promethease analysis.)


The first page identifies that I tested positive for **""3 genetic variants that have a moderate association with a reproductive condition.""** Each variant is then listed, along with the effect strength, odds ratio (calculated from meta analysis), medical condition, allele frequency, gene, my particular variant and rsID, and the biological process that the variant affects. For me, these were: **IL18** (associated with repeated pregnancy loss; affects immune response regulation), **MTHFR** (associated with repeated pregnancy loss; affects blood circulation), and **GDF9** (associated with primary ovarian insufficiency/premature ovarian failure; affects follicle development). 


It also says that I also tested positive for **18 ""complex effect variants.""** These variants meet the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) guidelines for supporting evidence of disease association and have achieved statistical significance through meta-analysis. However, due to a low odds ratio or a high prevalence in the general population, ""their effect on reproduction is in the context of a more complex signature"" and the information is provided ""for your conservative interpretation."" 


Page 2 is a simple list of the 18 complex effects variants, along with the associated medical conditions, gene, variant, rsID, genotype, and the biological process it affects. 


Pages 3 - 11 contain detailed information on the main 3 genetic variants I tested positive for. This includes several pages of bullet-pointed information for each variant, covering topics including Gene Summary, Possible Reproductive Function & Relationship to Infertility, Celmatix Meta-Analysis Results, Functional Evidence, and References. For each gene, the report includes between 16 and 34 citations of peer-reviewed research papers! Overall, I'm very happy with the information and level of detail provided.

So a few months ago I decided to go to an EMDR therapist after talk therapy was only sort of helping me get over my complex trauma. EMDR has been really helpful and a lot of progress has been made. 

I had my second FET last week and I know I'm not supposed to stress too much. And I know every day stress is OK, like work deadlines, it's the big stuff that you're supposed to avoid. But EMDR is kind of all about reliving the big stuff... although it's totally cathartic (for me). Does anyone who has experience with trauma therapy or EMDR specifically have any thoughts? I talked it over with my therapist and she was open to pausing therapy or just taking things down a notch, whatever I was comfortable with, but I don't know, do I need to pause at all?

<p>I had my second FET last week and I know I&#39;m not supposed to stress too much. And I know every day stress is OK, like work deadlines, it&#39;s the big stuff that you&#39;re supposed to avoid. But EMDR is kind of all about reliving the big stuff... although it&#39;s totally cathartic (for me). Does anyone who has experience with trauma therapy or EMDR specifically have any thoughts? I talked it over with my therapist and she was open to pausing therapy or just taking things down a notch, whatever I was comfortable with, but I don&#39;t know, do I need to pause at all? I don&#39;t want to miscarry again but I also don&#39;t want to wait on getting better, if it&#39;s going to help.   </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

2. If my doctor won't get me a prescription, then where can I go overseas to get it without one? I think maybe Mexico? If anybody has gone there to get it, any recommendations on what pharmacy or clinic to go to? Any other countries where I can get good HGH without a prescription?

Update guys. Thanks for all the responses! I saw my ivf doctor today. He not only agreed to give me a prescription for HGH but he said that it is really good to take but expensive.

I always want to post after getting bad results from my doctor because I can never find any good info online.  Thanks for always being here.  So I've been on estrogen and went in today on CD 11 for bloodwork and ultrasound for my FET Monday, and my progesterone was already an 11, so it's cancelled.  I had 3 follicles/simple cysts and 3 complex cysts at cd2 baseline, so I'm not sure if one of those follicles actually ovulated??  My ovaries were all kind of fucked up looking at baseline.  Today all the larger ""follicles"" were gone and I had like 2-3 complex cysts still.  Any insight on what might have happened?  Could one of those complex cysts have been a corpus luteum?

So.  Since my only embryo is a day 3, low grade, 4 cell, pathetic loser, I'm thinking about just stimming again next cycle instead of trying the FET again.  I'm a school teacher and only have 1 more cycle to fit into the end of the summer.  

I'm going to start HGH priming tonight with 6 units, and I'm going to do estrogen priming to try to prevent lead follicles like last time.

Also, did anyone add in Cetrotide/Ganirelix before your CD1 to further prevent lead follicles from developing?  I'm thinking about asking about it.

I’ve read all the rules for the group and hope this post is alright.

I’m 29 years old. I’ve been trying to have a child with my husband for 2 years. I had a missed
miscarriage & D&C at 11 weeks in February 2017 (heart stopped at 9 weeks), a natural
miscarriage at home at 6 weeks 5 days in May 2017, a chemical pregnancy in September 2017, and I’m currently sat post-op in hospital for a missed miscarriage at 13 weeks 4 days (heart stopped only a few days ago).

Obviously, I’m devastated. I chose not to get the remains back, I couldn’t handle that. So they’re cremating at the hospital. They’ll be doing genetic testing this time so in a few weeks I should find out if it was a boy or a girl and hopefully I’ll get some answers as to why this keeps happening to me.

Dealing with the losses feels routine at this point (as sad as that sounds) so I don’t need help grieving the losses. What I am struggling with is how to come to terms with the fact that my body isn’t doing what it’s meant to do. Everyone around me gets pregnant and carries healthy babies and I’m over here... failing. Over and over again. Telling my husband “I’m so sorry” repeatedly because I feel like I’m failing him. He doesn’t blame me at all - he’s wonderful - but I still carry the guilt.

I hope I’m in good company here, as I don’t fit in with those who have been trying for <6 months or those who have only had one chemical pregnancy. Not discounting their experiences, I just... can’t relate anymore and feel very alone.

How do I go on from this point? Not asking for fertility advice - I just mean... how am I suppose to continue on with my life without feeling an immense sense of bitterness? I can deal with the sadness... I’ve learned how to swallow that. It’s the bitterness I’m left with now that’s eating me alive.

My first cycle began with BCP (for 4 weeks because I was on vacation and my doctor ok’ed stretching the cycle out) and then 225iu Follistim + 1 vial menopur daily. It was cancelled due to lack of follicle development and low estradiol.

1 month before IVF #1 my estradiol was 21.81. Day 4 of stims it was 14.61 and Day 7 it was 53.76, thus the cancellation.

 I got my period Monday night. I’ve stimmed Tues PM, Wed AM&PM, and Thurs AM. I’m still having a period to the point where I’m losing blood clots and have what I’d classify as moderate bleeding. 

I had one u/s 4 days before starting meds where they told me my lining was really thick and to expect a heavy period. I’m terrified that my doctors office has been irresponsible by not doing blood work or anything at the beginning of the cycle again — no ultrasound to confirm I’m ready to start meds, just guessing when I should start. I’m pissed at myself for not demanding they be more thorough, because I am going to lose it if I have to cancel another cycle.

Hey y’all, it’s been a bit since I posted in here. I’ve been hanging in Senior Class, and occasionally pop back in here to see what’s up. I thought I would break out a little and get your thoughts on something today, though. 

About a year ago, my friend, who also is/was my pastor (I haven’t been church in a year because I don’t know what I think about god anymore after infertility), sent me this article: [Why the Church Needs the Infertile Couple](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2017/may/why-church-needs-infertile-couple.html)

It made me uncomfortable the first time I read it, but I understood he was trying to be supportive by telling me I matter. But now, it makes me angry. I have a different perspective now. This article makes me feel objectified, like I’m a means to an end. It makes me feel even more of an outsider. It seems foolish and naive and very foot-in-mouth.

He bought me the book, and said to me, ""I think you should read this.""

A BIG NOTE - THERE ARE TRIGGERS IN THIS BOOK, BUT THE BOOK WAS SO LOVINGLY AND SENSITIVELY WRITTEN I DIND'T CARE. This is not a book on infertility, but I felt so spoken to. I sobbed openly on the airplane and didn't GAF.

I read this book on the flight home in 2 hours. I don't know the last time I felt so acknowledged OR the last time I couldn't turn a page fast enough. Y'all. Here are some excerpts -- (I actually typed out more, but realized that this post would end up being half the damn book. Seriously, so good y'all)

""As a patient, it's upending to be confronted with the actual fragility of everything you once believed to be a constant. To inhabit that vulnerable space, and to have no one around you who is open to discussion of the devastation is patently surreal.

The book is about a doctor&#39;s dramatic plunge into the world of medical care as a patient and realizing that the medical world didn&#39;t know how to see or acknowledge a patient&#39;s pain. He bought me the book, and said to me, &quot;I think you should read this.&quot;</p>

<p>A BIG NOTE - THERE ARE TRIGGERS IN THIS BOOK, BUT THE BOOK WAS SO LOVINGLY AND SENSITIVELY WRITTEN I DIND&#39;T CARE. This is not a book on infertility, but I felt so spoken to. I sobbed openly on the airplane and didn&#39;t GAF.</p>

<p>I read this book on the flight home in 2 hours. I don&#39;t know the last time I felt so acknowledged OR the last time I couldn&#39;t turn a page fast enough. Y&#39;all. Here are some excerpts -- (I actually typed out more, but realized that this post would end up being half the damn book. Seriously, so good y&#39;all)</p>

<p>&quot;As a patient, it&#39;s upending to be confronted with the actual fragility of everything you once believed to be a constant. To inhabit that vulnerable space, and to have no one around you who is open to discussion of the devastation is patently surreal.</p>

I was typing this into the afternoon daily discussion thread, but there's enough info here, I decided to do a stand-alone post because I thought future people with our issue might find it helpful.

So, the urologist thinks we have a 50/50 chance of finding sperm if we do an mTESE (my husband has idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia).  So now, the question is how to time the mTESE, especially in light of my DOR.  The urologist is going to talk to our RE this week (who we meet with on Friday), and the RE is going to then provide us all our options and the two docs' joint recommendations for our specific situations, but it seems like we have 3 options:

1. Do an mTESE before we do any egg retrieval. The outcome could be no sperm, very few sperm (e.g., single digits), or plenty of sperm (thousands-to-millions).  If sperm is found, it will be frozen, and the doctor says he sees about 50&#37; of TESE sperm survive thaw, but if we have very few sperm, thaw might kill them all.  The benefit is that I don't have to do the egg retrieval until we know we have sperm.  Downside is we could get very few sperm and have no eggs available to fertilize with them, thus wasting that sperm, and husband would then have to do a second mTESE later (which may or may not find more sperm), after we retrieve eggs. 
2. Do back-to-back egg retrievals until we have a good-sized batch of eggs (e.g., 25-30), which could take 4-7 cycles for me, before doing mTESE. The benefit is my husband would have to only do one mTESE ever. The downside is freezing eggs (though apparently my clinic's lab has great results with freezing and thawing eggs), and doing many of egg retrievals before we even know if the mTESE will work.  I probably would not want to do this unless my husband was ready to at least discuss the possibility of donor sperm if the mTESE does not find viable sperm, because it would be insane and wasteful and awful to do a ton of egg retrievals and then just destroy the eggs because we have no way to fertilize them.
3. Coordinate an mTESE with my first egg retrieval.  The benefit is both egg and sperm (if we get it) would be fresh for that first cycle (thus letting us know how our gametes work under ideal conditions), and if there is a lot of sperm, we can freeze it for later egg retrieval cycles.  The downside is that I would probably have to do suppression to make my cycle sync with when the urologist is available instead of working with my natural cycle, and my RE didn't want to do that because of my DOR.  This also carries the risk that my husband would have to do a second mTESE, like option 1, if it finds only very few sperm and we need to go in a second time for later egg retrievals.  Another risk is finding no sperm, which would mean we'd have to have a donor sperm backup (which my husband isn't psychologically ready to discuss), or we'd have to freeze the eggs.

Obviously, these are weighty choices, all with pros and cons, and even the urologist didn't have a clear one he preferred for us.  He's going to talk to the RE, and they may have more refined recommendations at our appointment with the RE, but in the end, we're going to have to pick one of these options or just not have kids.
