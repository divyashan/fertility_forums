I Am Happy, but It’s Buried Deep

I saw your photos on social media today. You and your husband proudly displaying that grainy ultrasound with the squiggle that will be your first child. I was happy for you, but it was buried deep.

I saw your posts today with your toddler in your arms on Fourth of July. You made a cute pun about welcoming in your soon to be second child, and I was happy for you, but it was buried deep.

I read today about the pains and cravings you’re having with your pregnancy, and how excited you are to have your second son. I was happy for you, but it was buried deep.

It is buried under three years of trying without a single positive. It is buried under countless nights crying and praying to God for a child, under hundreds of “what-if” moments were a future without children is a real possibility. It is buried under thousands of dollars in medical costs, hundreds of pills, injections, and numerous ultrasounds, where instead of seeing my beautiful developing child, the black empty void of my womb stares back.

I’m certainly not trying have a “pain Olympics” as I know that’s a scenario I’ve heard tossed around on here. My intention is also not to offend anyone—what makes this world so great is our different opinions, and I have mine based on my own experience, so I’m sure someone will downvote me or say I’m fucked up. However, I do believe that my pain of never gotten pregnant is the same as losing a fetus. Hear me out. And believe me, we tried. People say we didn’t try hard enough. “Did you have sex during the right days?” Like omg yes we are not just “having fun” (whatever that is). Fertility testing: low AMH, high FSH, sperm: high abnormal morphology. We have gone through 3 IUIs. I took ovulation tests twice per day. We didn’t have sex for 3 days up to the IUI, then had sex for the next 3 days straight. But we had to make sure we had sex 5 days before the IUI so my husband’s sperm was “fresh”. Husband had to jack off in a room that is clinical and full of old playboys does not have his wife. I lay on a medical table and a stranger has me sign off on my husband’s sperm before it gets prodded inside of me. During my naivety in the beginning when they told me during my TWW not to drink alcohol or coffee, do not eat cold cuts or sushi, do not take Advil, do not go in hot tubs because I might be pregnant and to call them “when I got a positive” so they could do another test, I believed I was pregnant. My husband and I had a hot springs vacation planned where I couldn’t even enjoy it because I “might” be pregnant not knowing there was a <10% chance with IUI. I put progesterone and estrogen suppositories up my vagina that leaked and I had to wear a pantyliner for 2 weeks. I took prenatal vitamins, vitamin D, COQ10 (as well as my husband), and took thyroid medication. I acted pregnant. I calculated my due date ok the internet. I thought about what was coming up in the next few months like weddings or events and what I might not be able to travel to or drink at because I would be too pregnant. Then the holidays I would miss because I’d be at home with a new baby and couldn’t travel. Should our parents come to ours rather than us to theirs? Whether we should sell our condo and start looking for a house so we could fit 3 rather than 2. I thought my malaise and tiredness was early pregnancy signs. Was that spotting or implantation bleeding? Was my nausea from a baby or my dinner? Should I browse the baby section at Target? Then I got my period. Along with the blood were mind blowing cramps. Everything we had spent our money on not to mention our hopes and dreams. IF clinic: oh call us on day two and we’ll get you right in again, not sure why it didn’t work. Then repeat that two more times. Fuck it. Not to mention the year before we had our IUIs I took ovulation tests, vitamins, and had the same TWW. People told me “oh don’t worry, we were wasted when we conceived him/her” or “I didn’t even know for 6 weeks! It’ll just sneak up on you!” or “My cousin was in her 40s and got pregnant without even trying!” Or my friend in question “we tried for a year and a half, and it happened naturally!” There are literally not enough curse words to react to that. 

My reason for asking is I have a friend who recently lost a second trimester pregnancy. Obviously I cannot relate the same way someone broke their arm because I’ve only broken a finger. But to me the loss of a dream is the same whether it was never a positive test or it was a miscarriage. Of course the physical pain is different. And probably the reality of something where you see a heartbeat v. nothing. I guess I’m seeking advice on how to talk to her. I want to say I know your pain. I made plans too. And they didn’t work out. I tried A LOT to have a baby. Like a fucking lot. Maybe more than her because she got pregnant naturally. But maybe not as much as others, for there always will be others that did more (we can’t afford IVF). But we spent thousands of dollars with zero insurance on trying to have one baby that fucking failed and that was my limit. I just feel like I’m not validated because I never actually got pregnant. My friends want to get her a gift for her loss. A spa day or massage or gift basket. Where was my gift for the loss that I had? What do I get for my loss of a dream of having a baby? And how can I talk to her as my friend? I feel the same pain of loss of a dream. I don’t think getting a positive pregnancy test would have made me feel any less of a mother than I did because I wanted it so bad. I think I was a mother for even trying. Some women don’t even try to have a baby, and they have one they don’t want—these are the people I see yell at their kids on the train, yet they are still mothers and I’m still a childless woman. Does my inadequacy of getting pregnant knock me out of some club of those that had miscarriages? Or those crap parents that have a kid they don’t even want? What is my place in the world?

It was only recently that these questions took on a new meaning to me and made me regret every time I ever asked, “When are you planning to have kids?” So ladies, I apologize.

Anyone who has ever asked these questions hasn’t driven an hour (or more) to the fertility clinic to line up at 7:00 am to be first in line when the clinic opens at eight to ensure they make it just in time for work that morning. These women haven’t injected themselves with hormones and driven back to that clinic for that same routine once or sometimes multiple times a week. These women haven’t felt the undying hope of a baby even through the most painful procedures, and they likely haven’t spent the next two weeks googling ‘pregnancy symptoms after two (or three, or four….) days’ and searching for any sign of early pregnancy. Did I just feel nauseous? Did my sense of smell just get heightened? Are these period cramps or implantation cramps? Is this implantation bleeding or am I getting my period? These women probably haven’t felt like they have wasted the past year, two years, or more of their life away waiting for the next procedure, injection, ovulation, or test day. These women probably have also never sought alternative medicines, acupuncture, osteopath, massage, meditation, essential oils, or my personal favourite, castor oil packs. Google it. It’s gross and it’s just as messy as it sounds. 

But. It’s not their fault. This is a secret. You don’t know the challenges associated with infertility until you are the one standing with a dozen other women outside in -30 degrees celsius waiting to be cattle called into the ultrasound room and have your blood drawn. 

What I have realized once I started sharing with people about this struggle, is that everyone who ever asked, “When are you going to have kids?” quickly turned into a listening ear that just wanted to be supportive. Those questions that made me feel inadequate or less of a woman turned to simple gestures of understanding; “That sucks. I am sorry you have to go through this.” It makes handling those 25 year olds who say, “I am getting too old to have kids” or “I’m so glad I had my kids in my early 20’s, I would never have the energy for them now” a *little* more tolerable. It makes the whole process and journey of infertility a little less isolating, and it allows us someone to laugh with when the ultrasound technician misses her target. #realtalk.

We also live away from our families and have had a slew of visitors lately. My husband and I have been on Skype conference calls with physicians at 7 am while my brother & his boyfriend are in the next room sleeping. It all feels very daunting.

&#x200B;

My parents arrive today and are staying with us for four days in a one bedroom apartment. I'm excited for the arrival, but I've been hit with this anxiety of ""hide all the fertility stuff, the pre-natal vitamins"" blah blah because I don't want them to know. This is a personal choice that my husband is supportive of because my mother can be very intense and I cannot add on the stress of her frequent calls for the status of my test results, drugs, ovulation, etc. if she knew all the history. Instead, I'm left with the snide remarks of ""oh, we're not allowed to ask about babies"" while trying to keep a smile on my face and not dive into the journey she likely cannot empathize with.

&#x200B;

This is a personal choice that my husband is supportive of because my mother can be very intense and I cannot add on the stress of her frequent calls for the status of my test results, drugs, ovulation, etc. if she knew all the history.

I’m in the UK so protocols are very strict when it comes to child welfare and basically not throwing out potential disabled babies. I don’t believe I really needed PGS- I’m 22 and statistically chances are my eggs will be genetically fine. They’re just safeguarding any future children we have. Nobody in my family has a genetic disorder or anything that could be ‘inherited’ but my clinic need to make sure. These are 100% UK rules. 

At my clinic it’s £2,750 to have 8 embryos analysed via PGS.

So my question here is. What happens if we have more than 8 embryos? Will they just discard of (likely) perfectly good and healthy embryos? We haven’t got the money to pay £2,750 further to have another 8 looked at. Is it possible the clinic can freeze all of my embryos and only do the PGS if we use up 8 ‘normal/good’ embryos that they’ve already tested? 

For example if we somehow, and in the unlikely event, ended up with 16 embryos, we’d have to pay £5,500 to have them all tested. We certainly do not have that kind of money but I’d be so upset if they discarded of my embryos because the chances are a few would be fine. 

I know this is all rambled and I’m kinda getting ahead of myself here but I’m genuinely curious and also a tad worried as I don’t want to end up with more than 8 embryos for the rest to get destroyed for (potentially) no reason.

In our first year I ended up having two surgeries. The first was to remove a 10cm cyst on my left ovary. It was around that time we discovered that I had hydrosalphinx which means I had fluid in my Fallopian tube. My doctor loaded me up on antibiotics and hoped the fluid would dissipate. 

Four months after I was back at my doctors office having excruciating pain and the ultrasound showed that my tube was inflamed and full of the fluid that had never fully gone away and that I had a 8cm cyst on the same ovary. A week later they removed my ovary and tube in what was supposed to be an outpatient procedure. When I woke up I found out my ovary had swollen to the size of a grapefruit and was twisted and it now had a 10cm cyst attached to it. My fallopian tube was twisted and kinked up like a balloon animal. I stayed in the hospital for three days because they couldn’t get my pain under control. I ended up having a stent placed in my kidney and bladder and had to have a catheter and pee bag attached to me for over a month. 

It took me three months to recover. 

Six months pass and my doctor gives us the green light to start trying again. I get off my birth control, and damn it, I feel like I’m going through puberty a second time. I’ve been so hopeful, so happy. Until last month. I felt like I had a cyst on my ovary that burst. I decided to treat myself to a mixture of thc/cbd for the pain because I’m tired of taking pain medicine and I figured they couldn’t do anything but give me more meds. 

Well last Thursday I’m having incredibly awful pain so I manage to get myself an appointment with my doctor same day and she thinks I’m having a flare up of  PID on top of having a cyst and wants an ultrasound. Prescribes antibiotics. Next day I wake up in excruciating pain. My doctor says go to the emergency room, so I do. 
That’s when they tell me that my fallopian tube is inflamed, full of fluid and they want me to take a higher dose of antibiotics. If I can’t keep my meds down I’ll have to stay in the hospital for a couple of weeks, and they might have to remove my tube. 
I have ONE fallopian tube and ONE ovary left. 

I am terrified. I have been crying non stop. 
I keep asking why this is happening to me!???!
I have seven sisters, two brothers and they all have children. 
My husband is so supportive and keeps saying, we’ll get through this together but I just want to scream at him and say this isn’t about him! He’s not the one who has to lose his reproductive organs! He already has three kids from another relationship. I feel so alone. I feel scared. I want so badly to become a mom and I know I’d be a damn good one! I just hate even thinking about this. I’m get so mad and jealous when I see or hear about how other people get to have children. 

I’m going to end up losing my ability to have children. I’m going to be the one who people look at with pity in their eyes. I know it because they already do.

Anyone catch this article? Alanis Morisette is expecting at age 45. It's interesting but mildly infuriating. She had issues trying to conceive her third, which I wouldn't wish on anyone. But it sounds like she was able to eventually do it. As someone pursuing egg donor conception I can't help but think she used an egg donor. Or maybe she's just lucky?

Me and my husband have not been able to conceive even after being told through various tests, drugs and injections that everything is fine. For the past couple of years or so we gave up as we came to the conclusion that if it doesn't want to happen then so be it. Although both our parents are still hoping and cannot understand our decision.

It  happened that both my sister's in law (husband's sister and my brothers wife) became pregnant at the same time and gave birth within three weeks from each other. I'm very happy for them but of course wasn't easy to digest for me.

I also happened to have a very inconsiderate family. My parents are totally careless and inappropriate. If you see my previous post from December/January you'll understand what I'm referring to. And the family of my brothers wife and such insensible egotistical idiots that it's unbelievable. They have no regard for anyone else, her family always comes first and foremost and no one else matters.

Today there was their child's christening and of course they invited us and my parents but didn't involve us. She put he sister and her husband as God parents which pissed me off a bit. Just because we don't have kids it doesn't mean that when push comes to shove we will not be able to rise to the occasion. 

Then the religious speeches come, you need to pray and pray to all of the saints (came with a list) and it will happen. You need to stop worrying and stressing about it. And of course because we're at a gathering I didn't want to cause a scene so had to just sit and nod. But my brain is just thinking ""shut the fuck up and stop trying to push your religious crap""

Even when we were trying I wasn't stressing my self. Of course there was an element of disappointment every month but I was calm. I always kept the mentality of if it wants to happen it will. So I really wasn't stressed.

Right now, we're planning on starting injectables and timed intercourse after a conference I have near the end of July.  Unfortunately, because we don't know how long my cycle will be or how long I'll need to be on meds, we can't start beforehand.  (Crossing fingers that my cycle waits until after the conference and doesn't start before it ends)

A couple nights ago, my husband was super excited to tell me that he was invited to speak at a conference across the country in late August.  The only kicker is, they needed to know in the next couple weeks whether he could do it.  It broke my heart to remind him that that could be our window.  And, if it was, it would be a VERY expensive mistake (we're completely out of pocket).

I think that's when it hit both of us:  If we go this route, we can't plan to do anything.  My RE said any injectable cycle starts with an ultrasound on CD3 and then would require frequent ultrasounds for what could be weeks.

So, we're realizing that we can no longer take a vacation trip to visit friends that we had been planning for months.  Neither he nor I (big career people) can now travel for work, since things are planned so far in the advanced.  Holidays with family can't happen (again, cross country).

I think we both feel that we've already been missing out so much (though a lot of it has been our own faults - bumming around because we're having a rough no-baby day) in the last 2 years of trying.  It was one thing when it was affecting smaller, daily things, but the stakes feel higher now.

Our current plan had been to do 3 cycles of injectable + TI and then move onto IVF if we had no luck.  But, for me, that could be up to 9 months!

We discussed, last night, our thoughts on doing one cycle of injectables and timed intercourse and then just moving on to IVF.

We figured, we'd be able to freeze my husband's sperm so he wouldn't have to be around for the egg harvesting, easing the burden on him at least.  The success rates would be so much higher with IVF than TI (our RE didn't think that IUI would increase our chances much more than TI).

75,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"We did an egg retrieval in January that failed miserably: 20 eggs retrieved, 9 mature, 6 fertilized, all arrested by Day 6. Zero embryos to test or transfer.  We were pretty devastated.

BUT!  We just finished our second egg retrieval last weekend and found out today that we got EIGHT blasts to send for testing! We got 22 eggs, 14 mature, 14 fertilized, 8 made it to blast.  I will list below all the changes we made, but I really think a huge part of the improvement was that we used the ZYMOT CHIP for sperm sorting this time. 

The ZyMot chip is a super simple and inexpensive device that helps sort the sperm to figure out which are the champions. It also reduces DNA fragmented sperm down to around 1%.  (After our failed cycle, with no clear reasons why it failed, we did a DNA fragmentation test and it came back as 35% fragmented, which is only a little higher than normal, but a urologist recommended the ZyMot to us and I went down the rabbit hole of reading every medical study and watching every video and became convinced that it would help us.)  Our clinic hadn't yet used it, but I advocated for us and pushed for it and they got some free samples from ZyMot and agreed to try it. (The chip usually costs around $125, so it's definitely affordable in the grand scheme of IVF costs).

I just want everyone to know about this chip, because I feel like everyone doing IVF should use it. It can't harm the sperm-- it only helps find the strongest sperm in terms of morphology, motility, fragmentation, etc.  And you can still do ICSI after the sorting. I really do believe it is a HUGE part of why our two cycles were so drastically different.

These are the other changes we made:

I switched from the Antagonist protocol, which is what we did last time (because my body was still fighting to ovulate on Cetrotide, we had to trigger a day or two earlier than my doctor would have liked so we had a lot fewer mature eggs.)  In January, I took 300 IU of Gonal-F, 2 vials of Menopur, 33 units of Omnitrope each night for ten nights of stims, started Cetrotide partway through, and then triggered with Ovidrel.

This time we did the Lupron Down Regulation cycle, and we got five more mature eggs than last time. I did 10 units of Lupron for ten days leading up to my period and then lowered it to 5 units during stim shots. I took 300 IU of Gonal-F, 2 vials of Menopur, 33 units of Omnitrope each night for ten nights of stims, and then triggered with Ovidrel.

My husband and I both did weekly acupuncture and Chinese herbs (although I stopped the herbs before doing the stim shots).

I upped my CoQ10 from 400mg to 800mg daily (400 in am and 400 in pm).

I added DHEA, 25mg, 3 pills per day for a total of 75 mg.

I added 5mg of melatonin.

I took a Royal Jelly supplement.

(I also continued to take my prenatal vitamins and prenatal DHA)

My husband took a cocktail of supplements, mostly in the FertilAid supplement, with 100mg extra of selenium, 600mg of CoQ10, and L-Carnitine.

I cut out caffeine and alcohol (except for the very occasional glass of wine for the special occasion) for a couple months and ate a lot of greens, avocado, eggs, wild salmon, roe, etc. My husband wasn't as hardcore, but was eating well and greatly limited his alcohol intake- which was never very high anyway.

Zero embryos to test or transfer.  We were pretty devastated.</p>

<p>BUT!  We just finished our second egg retrieval last weekend and found out today that we got EIGHT blasts to send for testing! We got 22 eggs, 14 mature, 14 fertilized, 8 made it to blast.  I will list below all the changes we made, but I really think a huge part of the improvement was that we used the ZYMOT CHIP for sperm sorting this time. </p>

<p>The ZyMot chip is a super simple and inexpensive device that helps sort the sperm to figure out which are the champions. It also reduces DNA fragmented sperm down to around 1%.  (After our failed cycle, with no clear reasons why it failed, we did a DNA fragmentation test and it came back as 35% fragmented, which is only a little higher than normal, but a urologist recommended the ZyMot to us and I went down the rabbit hole of reading every medical study and watching every video and became convinced that it would help us.)  Our clinic hadn&#39;t yet used it, but I advocated for us and pushed for it and they got some free samples from ZyMot and agreed to try it. (The chip usually costs around $125, so it&#39;s definitely affordable in the grand scheme of IVF costs).</p>

<p>I just want everyone to know about this chip, because I feel like everyone doing IVF should use it. It can&#39;t harm the sperm-- it only helps find the strongest sperm in terms of morphology, motility, fragmentation, etc.  And you can still do ICSI after the sorting. I really do believe it is a HUGE part of why our two cycles were so drastically different.</p>

<p>These are the other changes we made:</p>

<p>I switched from the Antagonist protocol, which is what we did last time (because my body was still fighting to ovulate on Cetrotide, we had to trigger a day or two earlier than my doctor would have liked so we had a lot fewer mature eggs.)  In January, I took 300 IU of Gonal-F, 2 vials of Menopur, 33 units of Omnitrope each night for ten nights of stims, started Cetrotide partway through, and then triggered with Ovidrel.</p>

<p>This time we did the Lupron Down Regulation cycle, and we got five more mature eggs than last time. I did 10 units of Lupron for ten days leading up to my period and then lowered it to 5 units during stim shots. I took 300 IU of Gonal-F, 2 vials of Menopur, 33 units of Omnitrope each night for ten nights of stims, and then triggered with Ovidrel.</p>

<p>My husband and I both did weekly acupuncture and Chinese herbs (although I stopped the herbs before doing the stim shots).</p>

This evening my clinic called to ask mine and my husbands permission to run a hepatitis B test on some blood they were already testing for HIV. They aren’t suspecting we have HEpatitis B or anything like that - it’s standard protocol and they forgot to mention it to us. We most likely do not have hepatitis B as I’ve only ever slept with my husband and an ex boyfriend who was a virgin at the time. Many years ago too.

My husband had a hepatitis B vaccine before travelling overseas about 6 years ago. I never received a hepatitis B vaccine as I’m 22 and have rarely ever travelled. Unless I had one as a child but my parents can’t recall as it was a long time ago.

The clinic told me they will be screening our blood for not only hepatitis B, but they also run a ‘hepatitis B immunity’ test. I definitely won’t be immune to it if I’ve never had it and I’ve also not had the vaccine!!

Does anyone know why they are testing us for immunity to this virus? Do we need to be immune to the virus to undergo IVF? Maybe I’m overthinking it but I’d imagine most adults haven’t had a hepatitis B vaccine and also have never caught it so surely most adults doing IVF have no immunity to it? I spoke to a friend who is a sexual health nurse tonight and she told me hepatitis B and C are rarely ever screened for anyway in straight couples as it’s so rare and it’s unlikely for a straight person to be offered a hepatitis vaccine for the same reason. Obviously she wasn’t talking in IVF terms.

**What thickens the endometrial lining?**

During the follicular phase of a menstrual cycle the endometrial lining thickens due to increasing levels of estrogen produced by the ovaries. In a natural cycle, ovulation triggers the introduction of progesterone which causes the lining to become receptive and begin to compact (decrease in thickness) \[1\].

**What is a “thin lining”?**

There is no standard definition of a “thin lining”, but most studies leverage a delineation of anywhere from <6mm to <8mm. Multiple studies have been done to exam the relationship between endometrial lining thickness and pregnancy rates, the specifics vary, but they all conclude that thinner linings are correlated with lower success rates. For example, a more recent large scale analysis \[2\], concluded the following live birth rates in comparison with lining thickness at trigger:

|Live Birth Rate|\>=8mm|7-7.9mm|6-6.9mm|5-5.9mm|4-4.9mm|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Fresh Transfer|33.7%|25.5%|24.6%|18.1%||
|Frozen Transfer|28.4%|27.4%|23.7%|15%|21.2%|

**Options to help thicken a lining?**

This article has a great detailed analysis \[3\], but here is a summary:

*Hormone Manipulation*

* Follicular Phase Exogenous Estrogen: Oral and/or vaginal estrogen tablets, intra-muscular estrogen injections, and/or transdermal estrogen patches
* Luteal phase Gonadotropins
* Low-dose hCG in conjunction with estrogen
* Low-dose Gonadotropins (aka stims)

*Tamoxifen -* Tamoxifen is a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator similar to Clomid. However, it also has an estrogen agonist effect at the endometrium level, whereas Clomid has a negative impact on endometrial proliferation.  Tamoxifen can be used as an ovulation induction medication potentially with additional endometrial benefits.

*Pentoxifylline (800mg) and Tocopherol (Vit E – 1000IU) -* Pentoxifylline is used as a vasodilator to increase blood circulation/flow and inhibit tumor related inflammatory reactions. In studies pentoxifylline and Vit E were used in conjunction over a period of six to nine months where improvement to endometrial thickness was observed.

*Tocopherol (Vit E – 600IU) -* Vitamin E has been studied alone and has demonstrated improvement in endometrial thickness.

*L-arginine (6g/day) -* L-arginine is an amino acid available OTC that acts as a vasodilator increasing blood circulation/flow.  Most studies evaluated the impact to endometrial thickness with treatment starting on CD1 of the cycle before an embryo transfer.

*Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra 100 mg/day vaginally) -* Sildenafil Citrate enhances the vasodilatory effects of nitric oxide which increase endometrial blood flow. Dosing is 25mg four times per day vaginally on CD3-10.

*Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor (G-CSF) -* G-CSF is a growth factor given as an infusion 2-9 days before a transfer or on day of retrieval. Doses vary across studies from 100-300.

*Human-Growth Hormone (HGH) -* Two very recent studies have come out that both conclude that the addition of HGH improved endometrial thickness \[6\]\[7\]. Combined the studies demonstrated higher implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates across patients, including some with repeated implantation failure.

**What about Endometrial Pattern?**

Endometrial pattern is also an indicator with one retrospective study concluding that a “triple-line” (tri-laminar) at trigger was associated with a 55.2% clinic pregnancy rate, where as a homogenous pattern being associated with a 37.% clinical pregnancy rate \[4\]. Another study, concluded that endometrial thickness did not correlate with increased implantation rates, but that a poor pattern was indicative of lack of receptivity \[5\]. They theorized that elevated progesterone triggered premature ovulation and therefore the endometrial receptivity window was opened and closed “early”. Both of these studies appear to correlate with my general understanding of endometrial behavior, the homogeneous (or compacted) pattern in both studies is likely a result of increased/early progesterone exposure which has resulted in the lining no longer being receptive at normal time of transfer.  If poor pattern is an issue, it might be useful to monitor pre-trigger/ovulation progesterone levels and attempt to transfer only when progesterone is properly controlled.

**Important Things to Note**

Many of the research studies show improved endometrial thickness, but do not show follow on improvements to live birth rates or clinical pregnancy rates.

Many of the studies point out that there was ***no data that indicated that clinical pregnancy is impossible with thinner linings***.  There were clinical pregnancies and live births in all measured endometrial thickness categories.

I’m 22 years old and due to start my first round of IVF in July. 

I have poly cystic ovarian syndrome, I haven’t ovulated on my own for over half a year now, and my husband has moderate MFI. It turned out, I was ovulating maybe once or twice a year and on those occasions where I did ovulate my husbands issues then came into play. A horrible cocktail of infertility and disappointment for 3 years. My husband is 30 but this is less relevant.

We saw a new RE 2 weeks ago. Straight up, he advised we move on to IVF whilst I’m ‘still so young’ He said he doesn’t often recommend IVF as a first option but as we’ve been trying for 3 years and my eggs are currently of excellent quality and quantity, he thinks IVF is our best bet. 

So the past 2 weeks have been a whirlwind of blood tests and ultrasounds and appointments at the clinic. 

Today we met with our IVF nurse for the first time who got us to sign some final consent forms and then showed me how to do the injections. Thankfully I’m only on one injection a day that is a very low dose because I’ve got tonnes of follicles from my PCOS so they don’t want to over stimulate me. 

We got out of the clinic and headed home with our huge box of medication. I was given instructions to start the pill that’ll make me bleed within the next 2 weeks (currently awaiting HIV screening results but we know that’ll be fine as we got tested 6 months ago at a private sexual health clinic, but lost the results!! Grrrr. Thankfully our fertility clinic was nice enough to repeat it for free!!) 

That’s when it hit me. And I thought for a brief few moments “What am I doing?” And “I must be totally mad injecting my body at 22 and paying over $10,000 just to have a shot at a baby.” I asked my husband if he felt the same way, he said he didn’t and couldn’t wait to start. 

I don’t want to back out of this - and I won’t back out of it - but now it’s all happening I feel incredibly nervous and lonely. I’m only 22, none of my friends have been through this, they probably never will - some of them don’t even know what IVF is. 
My parents aren’t the greatest pillars of support either. My mom is pretty uncaring by nature and my dad is devastated by the fact his 22 year old daughter needs IVF, so he won’t speak about it. His coping mechanism is avoidance. 

When the RE first told us he wanted to move us onto IVF, I was so excited because I thought it would 100% lead us to a baby. Now I’ve crashed down to earth and realised that it isn’t a 100% chance. It isn’t for anyone. We could be throwing away 10k for nothing.  (2 cycle program with PGS and medication included within this figure I’m quoting)  We have to do PGS due to an issue on my side of the family regarding chromosomal abnormalities but I’d rather not go into details about that right now. 

Along with all of the above, my anxiety is rampant currently. Every little thing is keeping me awake at night with regards to IVF and fertility. I can only imagine it’ll get worse after egg retrieval and then the two week wait. I asked our clinic today if I could undergo counselling with them, which they were happy to set up for me and I’ve got my first session next week. 

My husband is also coming to the therapy sessions. Emotionally we are strong but not physically. Our sex life has taken a nose dive. I never want sex anymore as I just don’t see the point. We’ve had daily sex every day now for 3 years and I’ve had enough. Finding out we were moving on to IVF has relieved some of this tension and we’ve had sex twice in the past week just for enjoyment but I still don’t feel too great. It’s also been super liberating to throw my OPKs out!!

After my husband was diagnosed with Male factor, he went through a period of time where he would see men with children in supermarkets or the mall and remark to me “he has normal sperm. Unlike me” this broke my heart and still does. 

Any advice or support would be great. Like I said, I don’t have much support so I’ll appreciate anything I get here,

I'd love to hear some of your thoughts on Letrozole and any stories about being treated by an OB vs. a Reproductive Endocrinologist in the U.S. if you're willing to share.

In summary, I was diagnosed with infertility due to PCOS three years ago and treated with Letrozole by a Rep. Endocrinologist, which was successful.

Over the past year, we decided we were ready to start this process again. We are living in a new state now so we had to find all new healthcare providers, but we found a great OB who referred us to a Rep. Endo. five months ago. We have been getting tested and going through progesterone induced cycles and having ultrasounds since that time and the Rep. Endo. has thus far only concluded what we already know: I still have PCOS + symptoms and I'm unable to have a cycle without the assistance of progesterone and Letrozole.

The Rep. Endo has agreed after five months of testing that we need to start Letrozole again since it was successful before, but there was a discrepancy with my insurance (it will pay for the testing and treatment of a condition but not the infertility treatment itself) so now the Rep. Endo. has referred me back to the OB to prescribe the Letrozole and says there is nothing more he can do for me and that I need to ask my OB to prescribe it due to the insurance issue. Unfortunately, the reason the OB referred me out to the Rep. Endo. in the first place was because she stated that she had little experience with Letrozole and would feel more comfortable with a Rep. Endo. assisting, but I left a message with her office tonight asking her if she would consider prescribing it to me anyway.

So, my question for you (and thank you for reading this far) is what the heck do I do now? What would you do? We are feeling really confused and tired and upset that we have been here waiting five months and have made no progress.

Would love to hear any advice or suggestions you're willing to share.

108,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility," **Intro:** I'm Argenterie. I'm 37 years old, so is my husband. We are trying to conceive our first child. We were diagnosed with unexplained (possible tubal factor) infertility. My husband and I live in a large southern US city. In real life, I'm a physician, and I only work part time. I enjoy my work, but in a perfect world, I would love to be a successful writer, book editor/reviewer or librarian. I love to read. I watch ""The Office"" on repeat when I need a boost. I love Stephen King, and horror and science fiction in books, TV, and movies.

I got sober 2 years ago, after struggling with alcoholism for several years. I am so grateful for my recovery, which has saved my life for sure. I go to AA, I do weekly group psychotherapy with my dear groupmates, who are other addicts/alcoholics in my profession, and I am drug/alcohol tested randomly which I chose to do. My sobriety has been strong and amazing. In addition to that major change in my life, last summer 2018, we also got my husband tested for a genetic disorder he was at 50% risk for, which would have been fatal if he had it, and luckily his results came back negative and he does not have the fatal gene. These two roadblocks, plus my medical training, were the primary reasons we delayed having children until recently.

**Brief summary of your infertility situation** We started trying to conceive in earnest in September 2018 after I went off my antidepressants (planned, and guided by my psychiatrist). I conceived spontaneously in December 2018, and had a miscarriage in February 2019 at nearly 9 weeks for what was later found to be Trisomy 22 (a lethal trisomy). No further pregnancies since then. After the miscarriage, I also started Prozac and continue to take this daily.

**Reproductive endocrinology workup and results** I started to see an RE once we hit 7 total months of TTC without success. My workup:

**Sonohysterogram:** normal 

**HSG:** normal fill and spill on the right side, but the left appears to have ""slight distal tube dilation"" that isn't quite hydrosalpinx but RE is concerned that left tube is not working perfectly. 

**AMH:** 2.64 (above the median for my age of 37) 

**CD3 FSH:** 7.6 

**CD3 Estradiol:** 30.8 

**Antral Follicle Count:** 25 

**All other bloodwork:** all normal.

&#x200B;

**The Plan:** My RE suggested that due to my age and the possible tubal factor, that IUI would likely have a 10% per cycle chance of pregnancy, and IVF closer to 50%+. We chose to go immediately to IVF. Based on my numbers, I should respond well to stimulation and generate enough eggs for a good number of embryos. We have also decided to do PGT-A and rule out aneuploidy as much as we can before any transfers. My RE only transfers 1 PGT-normal blast each time in women my age. I am currently in my Luteal Phase, and assuming I am not pregnant at the end of this two weeks, then we will start controlled ovarian hyperstimulation immediately thereafter.

We have to sort out the financial part (I think Cigna will pay for 3 cycles of IVF per live birth, but we have to be pre-certified/authorized, so I want to get that done as soon as we can). Otherwise, I feel very ready and energized to finally have a sense of control again (though I know that is just an illusion!).

Based on what the RE said today in our appointment, I believe we will start with a short protocol, with FSH to stimulate, and then a lupron trigger. I'm hopeful that with my decent AMH, AFC etc, that I should respond well, but then again, you never really know. I'm wary of OHSS but my RE thinks we can avoid it.

**Things I am concerned about and may need support on:**  I am worried of course about IVF not working, but who isn't? The things I am more proximally concerned about: my mental state during these medically complex times, with all the injections, procedures, and the Hunger Games of attrition. My ongoing sobriety/recovery from alcoholism is vitally important to me, and I am not willing to risk drinking again. Luckily, the Prozac I started after my miscarriage seems to have taken the edge off my depression/anxiety symptoms, but I am also seeing my therapist tomorrow, and I'm seeing my psychiatrist next week to see if we need to adjust anything.

Thanks for reading. I am disappointed to end up in this community, but I have been lurking in the dailies for weeks, so I wanted to formally say hello and give virtual hugs or high fives to you all.

I will start by saying I went to see my doctor about this and he said because I have an appointment with a fertility doc in a month, he wouldn’t do anything about it. He said it will just be “part of the story” of my current fertility issues.

Background (including previous success):
My husband and I have been trying to conceive our second for 7 months now. Our first took 2 years and 3 rounds of Clomid to conceive (I conceived the first natural cycle after Clomid). 

Never had any mid-cycle spotting ever, until about 3 months ago. I have noted down symptoms from my last 3 cycles. Nothing has changed - eating the same and taking prenatal vitamins.

Cycle 1 was 30 days with positive opks on cd18 and 19. I spotted on days 24, 28 and 29.

Cycle 2 was 32 days with positive opks on cd19 and 20 with no spotting. 

Cycle 3 was 34 days with positive opks on cd19 and 20 but I spotted on days 26 and 28-33

The spotting was orangery on some days and brown/stringy on others. My period was fairly normal (for me) all 3 cycles - red with clots, got heavier and then lightened.

I’ve been getting more migraines which I do feel are hormone related. I used to get one on the day of my period and one when I had the positive opks. I got migraines on some of the days when I spotted. 

I’m guessing I have some sort of hormone imbalance currently. Which hormone/hormones could cause this?

Side note: My smear test from last year was normal.

After the second MC, one OB at the practice (hereby called OB1) ordered some blood testing done. The testing came back saying she MIGHT have some blood clotting disorder. OB1 said that it was “something to monitor and that she might want to get it looked at” but didn’t think it was a big deal. 2nd MC was probably just bad luck again says OB1.

We get pregnant again right away. We go to the same practice again for an ultrasound at six weeks. We see a different OB this time. She will be OB2. She says that everything looks fine with baby, there is a heartbeat but it’s faint and baby is measuring a little smaller than the 6 weeks we thought. This is “normal” according to OB2.

We mention the blood clotting thing and OB2 says “I wouldn’t have even tested you for that. I don’t know why OB1 ordered those tests. Just disregard them.” We end up MCing for a third time.

At this point, everything feels lost. We think about giving up on having kids. They do chromosome testing on us and everything comes back fine. We get recommended from many people to go see this fertility specialist.

We see him yesterday and he literally takes one look at her blood work, her “irregularities” with the results, identified that she has protein S deficiency, and put us on a plan that he says he feels will “guarantee a 90% chance of successful pregnancy whenever we are ready to try again.” Maybe what he is saying is BS and won’t work, but it felt amazing to have someone explain SOMETHING to us and give us hope/plan.

Some of the treatment is as simple as taking low dose aspirin every day. None of this was every mentioned by either OB, which had me rather furious as it could have saved my amazing wife a ton of strife and suffering.

116,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone. We have opted for an IUI cycle this month after 3 months of OI, following a 14 week loss in October last year. 

Just wondering the following: 

My OI cycles we did letrazol 5mg days 3-7, scan day 12, and the last two cycles we did a trigger on day 12 and 13, and then I very obviously felt ovulation on day 14 both times. Previously, I wouldn’t ovulate until about day 20, and I had 34 day cycles, last time I had a 29 day cycle, this time 30 days. I’m currently CD 2 and I thought they’d be doing FSH injections but I didn’t hear back from the nurse like I expected - when do others normally start their FSH injections? Could I have missed my chance to do that protocol now since it’s currently 19:40 on CD2 and I don’t have them? 

Secondly, my husband has cyclic neutropenia which we think has led to his sperm issues. We obviously achieved a pregnancy with his sperm last time, but not sure if we should try IUI for very long because if this? He has 1% morphology, 48% motility (38% progressive motility) but only a count of 10million per m/l. (So his entire sample was 33million) - do you think these things could impact on our chances of IUI? 

Thirdly, I also have endo, but had a surgery a year ago (which is what helped us achieve a pregnancy) I am certain it’s growing back, but wasn’t sure if this would impact our chances? 

Also, is there anything anyone else thinks might be good to know? If we have been pretty consistent with our OI cycle dates - do you think that could be the same for this cycle? (I have to travel 2.5 hours for the IUI so I’ll be staying overnight so trying to plan time off as best I can!) and do you think a 2.5 hour drive home after the procedure might be a bad idea?",t2_3x0mb7r2,False,,0,False,First IUI this cycle,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_c63jcp,False,dark,0.25,,public,0,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},TW: Miscarriage/Loss,False,0,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1561657492.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone.

I start an amazing new job in August as I couldn’t put my life on hold whilst going through treatment. The problem is I need to travel to Africa. They haven’t stated what their expectations are with respect to travel, but hoping the first trip is just a meet the team down there. The trouble is I’m going through treatment which means I can’t really go to Africa regularly due to zika and malaria risks. I’m happy to go the first time, but not sure how to handle it after that. I’m 40 so can’t really put off my treatment but I am on a little break to sort out some minor health problems, meaning I can go this time and then have a zika test.

<p>I start an amazing new job in August as I couldn’t put my life on hold whilst going through treatment. The problem is I need to travel to Africa. They haven’t stated what their expectations are with respect to travel, but hoping the first trip is just a meet the team down there. The trouble is I’m going through treatment which means I can’t really go to Africa regularly due to zika and malaria risks. I’m happy to go the first time, but not sure how to handle it after that. I’m 40 so can’t really put off my treatment but I am on a little break to sort out some minor health problems, meaning I can go this time and then have a zika test. The doctor can stop me from travelling and in this country we don’t need to justify the reasons why.  But my British culture of having to justify everything is making me quite conflicted. Anyone been in a similar situation? Any words of wisdom? Thanks 😊</p>

I went to have my thyroid check 2 weeks ago yesterday, but hadn't gotten the results. I sent them a message on their patient portal/website last Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday asking for someone to call me with the results. nobody ever did. So, I do up early to call them right when their office opened at 7:00 Monday, but still ended up having to leave a message on the machine. at 9:55 the poor receptionist called to tell me that nobody from my team would be in that day, but that she would make sure somebody would call me on Tuesday (yesterday). She did let me know that they had an IVF class scheduled for July 1st at 1:00pm. So, I waited around yesterday for a phone call and never got one. I would have called them, but Benadryl knocked me out until after their office closed. so, I just called them and poor receptionist got my wrath again because my NP was supposed to be back yesterday, but still isn't back today. I told her that she better find someone in the office to read my medical results because while I know that she is just the receptionist I was getting super frustrated. Receptionist then transferred me to one of their Medical assistants who was able to tell me that my thyroid originally back in March was at 4.2, in May with the meds it went down to 3.4 and this last time it went down to 2.4. they want it under 2 before they transfer an embryo. Since that won’t be until October or November at the earliest, we're not too worried about it right now. I then had to check to make sure that the clinic is sending my prescriptions to the mail order pharmacy that the insurance wants us to be using. it takes 2 weeks to get some of the meds for retrieval to be authorized with the pharmacy, so I wanted to make sure they were doing all of this. The MA wasn't sure that I was on the IVF coordinators radar to make sure this would get done in time, but that she would definitely follow up with the coordinator today and that I would be getting a calendar with all my IVF information by the end of the week and that if I didn't to let her know.

We had good and valid reasons at the time for being childfree but things changed.

Just over 10 years after the vasectomy we had it reversed. The surgery went well and the reproductive urologist was pleased with the surgery (vasovasostomy). There were no complications during surgery or the recovery process. My husband barely had any pain and took one Tylenol on the first day and that was it. He did everything he was supposed to do: wore briefs, kept it dry, iced it, didn't exercise, and we didn't have sex until almost three weeks post surgery.

His first assessment in January was understandably awful. The second assessment in March showed great improvement. The third assessment in May showed worrying numbers. That's when the RE and on-site reproductive urologist at the fertility clinic (not the one who did the surgery) recommended banking just in case. Just under three weeks later we went and did the first banking. This was last week. They were expecting similar results to the May assessment but the numbers were much worse and closer to the January assessment. You can see a comparison of all four assessments here: https://i.imgur.com/t4i07Sl.jpg

Here are some details:

* He doesn't drink alcohol at all (he's allergic)
* Completely cut out caffeine (he used to drink green tea and iced tea, no coffee) and hasn't had either in over half a year
* Wears loose fitting boxer briefs (not briefs, hates boxers so I don't give him grief on that one)
* Sleeps naked
* Ices his balls once a day for 20 minutes
* No hot baths, no hot showers, no hot tub no seat warmers, no laptop on his lap, no cat on his lap
* No smoking or drugs
* From January through May he was told to ejaculate every second or third day to help with sperm production
* Eats well
* Is in good shape

My husband has ADHD and he has some severe allergies as well as asthma. He has a severe allergy to NSAIDs. He recently switched his ADHD meds but both the med he was on and the med he's on now are safe to use and don't harm sperm production as confirmed by his primary care provider, his urologist, the on-site urologist, and the RE. He lives with chronic sinusitis and was taking Sinutab under the guidance of him immunologist for a while. Here's a list of the medications he takes: https://i.imgur.com/Y7z803G.png He took prednisone tablets for one week in February for a sinus infection but he was also told that was safe to take.

These are the vitamins and supplements he was taking from November through a week ago:

* Vitamin C
* Vitamin D
* CoenzymeQ10
* My Kirland prenatal (because it has zinc, selenium and folate in it)

Here's what he's been switched to and has been taking for the past week:

* Vitamin C
* Vitamin D
* Turmeric (they put him on this since he can't take NSAIDs)
* Men's multivitamin that has zinc and selenium in it
* L carnitine
* L arginine
* L glutathione
* Folate
* ConenzymeQ10

He had bloodwork taken last week for a full a workup on full panel male hormones (waiting on results for that) and he's getting tested for anti-sperm antibodies in two weeks. He's also waiting on an appointment with an immunologist. He goes for a second banking appointment early next week so we'll see what those numbers look like then.

I think the issue is related to the Sinutab. The drop-off on the results correlates to the Sinutab use and if I do some Googling (always risky) I did find some small studies that said it definitely affects sperm:

>The percentages of normal sperm morphology were significantly decreased in both acute and chronic groups when compared with controls while the total sperm count was significantly decreased in the acute group. Apoptotic activities were increased significantly in both pseudoephedrine-treated groups. The results indicate that pseudoephedrine can induce sperm abnormalities, decrease sperm numbers and increase apoptotic activity in the testis of rats if taken at high doses. The results of this study suggest that the users of pseudoephedrine in medical treatments need to be aware of its potential toxicity involving spermatogenesis.

His reproductive urologist (the one who did the reversal and checkups) doesn't think it's an occlusion. That was his feedback after the May assessment. He hasn't replied yet after last week's assessment. The RE and on-site reproductive urologist both think it's an occlusion.

<p>Will we be likely to need to stay in the city for more than a few days? I know that treatments take time, I&#39;m just not certain of the timing.</p>

<p>How much time per day do the monitoring and testing take? I would plan on working around the appointments but do they usually take 30 minutes, an hour?</p>

<p>And on a more direct note, are there any recommendations for clinics in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Area?</p>

<p>Any help I could get would be lovely, I just want to be prepared with actual answers instead of guesses going into this.</p>

I recently moved from the U.S. to Nairobi, Kenya. I've been pursuing fertility treatments here, but after an epic fail ER last month (more on that below), I've decided I need to seek help elsewhere. 

I will be using my own eggs and I am planning to stay for 4-8 weeks, or however long is needed to do the full cycle, including stimming and hopefully fresh transfer. I have a slight preference to stay in Prague since I will be there so long (I'm assuming better lodging options and more to do), but am very flexible on location and just want to find the best clinic. 

All of my searching through past threads has led to posts where people are choosing clinics based on donor egg prices/services. Since I will be using my own eggs, I'm hoping to get some advice on choosing a clinic that doesn't prioritize donor egg-related decisions.

Background: We have unexplained infertility and are both 34 years old. All of our tests so far: SA for him, AMH, AFC, etc. for me, came back with good results. We tried for 12 months naturally, then had three failed natural cycle IUIs (1 CP in there), and just had a huge failure of an IVF egg retrieval. I had 12 prominent follicles that were all developing well, 12 eggs were retrieved but 10 of those were immature and the other 2 very low quality. I was triggered on CD11 with follicles sized 16mm-18mm. And I'm thinking my Ovitrelle shot was a bit deactivated as well because my UPT on the day of ER was so faint that you had to squint to see it. My RE is claiming an egg quality issue, but after a separate post on here and much helpful advice from this community, I believe strongly it was an RE-quality issue instead. Such a high quantity of immature eggs points to being triggered too early or an ineffective trigger shot. So I'm definitely in the market for some higher-quality care.

I have been battling the knowledge of infertility for only a year but it seems like five. I'm turning 36 soon; husband is 41. After about 6 months of trying to conceive naturally using ovulation predictors, temperature readings and cervical mucus checking, still no luck. Given my age, I asked my husband to make appointments with the suggested a fertility clinic. I ask him to handle the administration because the official language here is not my native. I speak at intermediate level, but for complicated matters, I defer to him for questions and translations. This adds to the stress of infertility because I cannot be a leader in this story that focuses on my body, plus I'm still going through culture shock. 

Over the next few months, the both of us did several tests with the clinic over. His tests came out well; the sperm improved after taking supplements and making some lifestyle changes. Me, on the other hand, appear to the weak link. I have no other known issues other than low AMH (0.8) and high FSH (16?).

On route, we uncovered my husband has low motility  sperm. For that reason, it's IVF and ICSI. So that's fine.

Then they get to my exam... somehow I only have enough viable eggs to give a 20% chance of success...on the high end. My AMH is in the tank. To get pregnant at all, I'm looking at donor eggs, which increases the cost immensely.

So, we might not be able to afford me getting pregnant barring a miracle. Is it worth getting a second opinion? Can a cyst removal increase AMH?

To try to keep it brief, I'd been with my girlfriend (38) for about 4 years. She has had amenorrhea for more than a year, and very severe menopausal symptoms. She's not doing HRT or any treatment of any kind, and she's been badly suffering. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, constant fatigue, hair loss, no sex drive, GI issues, hot flashes, irritability, memory loss and brain fog, pretty much everything, dialed up to 10.

I deeply love her and have been doing everything I can to support her. Not having kids doesn't make me feel any different about her. I'm concerned because she's just been diagnosed with ""perimenopause"", but that doesn't seem right. She's just gone to her primary care, not an RE. It seems clear that she has POI. 

Half a year ago she told me we have to break up, out of the blue, because she feels guilty that she's not giving me the relationship I deserve. She changed her mind a couple days later, but things went downhill despite my best efforts - we didn't have sex or have any kind of intimacy at all, even hold each other and kiss. Then eventually she couldn't sleep next to me. Saw me once every 3 weeks or so. Then barely even talked to me. Then ended things over text, and for a couple weeks alternated between affection, being close to me and sleeping in bed with me, and being distant before ultimately ending it over text again.

She's been insisting that it's because of the symptoms and that she still deeply loves me, could never love anyone else, and her feelings haven't changed, and I'd like to believe her, but it's hard to. I've tried very hard to support her and be close with her through this, I haven't withdrawn at all. And I've explained that I love her and want to be with her no matter what.

Hi Everyone!  I’ve been fairly active in the Trying For A Baby sub but I felt I needed to migrate over here for ya’lls advice and understanding. My husband and I have been TTC since February of 2018 and since we met with our RE a few weeks ago things have been moving incredibly fast. My RE is about to start a clinical trial for Rekovelle and asked if we would want to be candidates for the trial. I honestly haven’t done too much research into IVF because I really though that would be much further down the road. I used Clomid for 5 cycles and upon meeting with the RE I was diagnosed with PCOS. My RE had originally planned on placing me on Letrozole beginning my next cycle- however he just called and said that with my most recent blood work I qualify for his upcoming clinical trial. For those of you that have been through IVF could you give me any advice or words of wisdom? I have an appointment on Wednesday to go over the basics for the trial and to ask any questions.

171,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Long rant incoming. I just need to share with someone that might understand. 

I spent the afternoon with a friend and her 3 month old baby today. Me and a couple friends had breakfast this morning and then went to visit our new Mamma friend and her big baby boy. I am so ready to be a Mum. I held him most of the visit, got spit up all over my shirt, changed his diaper twice and was lucky enough to ward of a few cries - well his anyways.

Most of my friends aren't ready to be parents. The two Mom friends I have were irresponsible with their birth control. They love being Mom's but it wasn't really something they or their partners where ""ready for."" 

One of the ladies today has been my best friend for over ten years, MOH at my wedding and knows what's happening with our infertility. The other knows we've been trying but is less up to date. Mamma didn't know at all. When she called to tell me she was pregnant last fall the first words out of my mouth were ""I hate you."" She didn't notice. I did end up telling her at the end of today's visit. 

I'm not ashamed of what we are going through. And I am happy for all these other babies and Mammas in my life. It just gets heavy sometimes.

And while I talk to a couple of my friends about this, none of them can actually understand what it's like. At least I have my husband to go through this with. But he still can't know what it's like for me as the woman.

Husband (29) and I (28) have been ttc for 2 years now. We have undiagnosed infertility - all the tests just keep coming back ""everything looks great"" which is really frustrating because obviously everything is not great. I just finished 6 months of Letrozole. Doctor said the next step would be IVF and we have an appointment August 9th (which is another 2 cycles away for me.)

I miss birth control. I have horrible cramps now when I get my period. I break out like a fucking teenager. I'm even starting to get a bit of brain fog on the first couple days. Periods suck and to top it all off, every time they happen I'm not pregnant. I'm sick of crying in the bathroom, sucking it up and going back to work.

We are young and have no other conditions so our doctor is optimistic. But I'm starting to get scared. Why can't we get pregnant? Is there something wrong with my eggs? or his sperm? If we do IVF the success rate at our clinic for our age is apparently ~75%. Which I suppose is great but it's going to be so fucking heart breaking if it doesn't take. Or what happens when it does take and I miscarry? Or even worse, we have a beautiful little baby that develops a terminal illness and we lose a child. I trust my body so why doesn't it want to make a baby? Why is it betraying me? 

Next weekend I'm going to visit my Grandparents and ask them if they could help us out financially with the treatment. But I'm nervous. I don't like asking for money, it's not something I've really done before but we are trying to buy a house in the next year and while we will dip in if we have to, we really want to buy a house for our family. And I don't know how to bring it up. Knowing me I might chicken out. I wish my husband could be there. He will come up if I ask him but it would be an 8 hour round trip in 1 day (I'm going to be in the area for other reasons, he has to work on the Saturday.) My family has never asked ""when are you going to have babies"" even though my husband and I have been married for 8 years. Something I have generally been thankful for but now I almost wish they would.

I've said most of this to my best friends but all they can do is nod sadly and say ""that's hard,"" ""you'll have your own baby soon enough"" or ""my mom had a hell of a time trying to have me.""

But it might not happen.  I just want to be a Mum so bad it hurts. I want to bring a tiny little human into this world and watch them grow. I want to read to them, share stories and adventure. I want to take them camping, teach them to ski and ride a bike and paddle a canoe. I want to show them how to build things and grow a garden and teach them how to cook. I want to see them discover things I never knew, I want to watch them discover who they are.

But the weight of trying is really starting to weigh.,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_c4il7h,False,dark,0.75,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Emotional Support,False,6,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1561381810.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Long rant incoming. I just need to share with someone that might understand. </p>

<p>I spent the afternoon with a friend and her 3 month old baby today. Me and a couple friends had breakfast this morning and then went to visit our new Mamma friend and her big baby boy. I am so ready to be a Mum. I held him most of the visit, got spit up all over my shirt, changed his diaper twice and was lucky enough to ward of a few cries - well his anyways.</p>

<p>Most of my friends aren&#39;t ready to be parents. The two Mom friends I have were irresponsible with their birth control. They love being Mom&#39;s but it wasn&#39;t really something they or their partners where &quot;ready for.&quot; </p>

<p>One of the ladies today has been my best friend for over ten years, MOH at my wedding and knows what&#39;s happening with our infertility. The other knows we&#39;ve been trying but is less up to date. Mamma didn&#39;t know at all. When she called to tell me she was pregnant last fall the first words out of my mouth were &quot;I hate you.&quot; She didn&#39;t notice. I did end up telling her at the end of today&#39;s visit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not ashamed of what we are going through. And I am happy for all these other babies and Mammas in my life. It just gets heavy sometimes.</p>

<p>And while I talk to a couple of my friends about this, none of them can actually understand what it&#39;s like. At least I have my husband to go through this with. But he still can&#39;t know what it&#39;s like for me as the woman.</p>

<p>Husband (29) and I (28) have been ttc for 2 years now. We have undiagnosed infertility - all the tests just keep coming back &quot;everything looks great&quot; which is really frustrating because obviously everything is not great. I just finished 6 months of Letrozole. Doctor said the next step would be IVF and we have an appointment August 9th (which is another 2 cycles away for me.)</p>

<p>I miss birth control. I have horrible cramps now when I get my period. I break out like a fucking teenager. I&#39;m even starting to get a bit of brain fog on the first couple days. Periods suck and to top it all off, every time they happen I&#39;m not pregnant. I&#39;m sick of crying in the bathroom, sucking it up and going back to work.</p>

<p>We are young and have no other conditions so our doctor is optimistic. But I&#39;m starting to get scared. Why can&#39;t we get pregnant? Is there something wrong with my eggs? or his sperm? If we do IVF the success rate at our clinic for our age is apparently ~75%. Which I suppose is great but it&#39;s going to be so fucking heart breaking if it doesn&#39;t take. Or what happens when it does take and I miscarry? Or even worse, we have a beautiful little baby that develops a terminal illness and we lose a child. I trust my body so why doesn&#39;t it want to make a baby? Why is it betraying me? </p>

<p>Next weekend I&#39;m going to visit my Grandparents and ask them if they could help us out financially with the treatment. But I&#39;m nervous. I don&#39;t like asking for money, it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve really done before but we are trying to buy a house in the next year and while we will dip in if we have to, we really want to buy a house for our family. And I don&#39;t know how to bring it up. Knowing me I might chicken out. I wish my husband could be there. He will come up if I ask him but it would be an 8 hour round trip in 1 day (I&#39;m going to be in the area for other reasons, he has to work on the Saturday.) My family has never asked &quot;when are you going to have babies&quot; even though my husband and I have been married for 8 years. Something I have generally been thankful for but now I almost wish they would.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said most of this to my best friends but all they can do is nod sadly and say &quot;that&#39;s hard,&quot; &quot;you&#39;ll have your own baby soon enough&quot; or &quot;my mom had a hell of a time trying to have me.&quot;</p>

<p>But it might not happen.  I just want to be a Mum so bad it hurts. I want to bring a tiny little human into this world and watch them grow. I want to read to them, share stories and adventure. I want to take them camping, teach them to ski and ride a bike and paddle a canoe. I want to show them how to build things and grow a garden and teach them how to cook. I want to see them discover things I never knew, I want to watch them discover who they are. For a fairly selfish person I want nothing more than to sacrifice and share my life and hobbies and time with them for the next 20 years. I want to be a Mum for the rest of my life. God I hope it happens.</p>

Some background - I'm 36, so is my husband. Husband's morphology is less than 1% normal at the last check. DNA fragmentation 23%. All of my hormones are in normal range and I have an AMH of 3.5. I am probably 40lbs overweight - but normal weight when we started trying (thanks stress and hormones). We had previous success naturally 4 years ago. Have been trying for 2 1/2 years. 

I had 7 eggs retrieved, ICSI, 4 fertilized on day 3. None made it to blast. We were going to have PGS testing and a FET next month.  

I followed an antagonist protocol - Menopur and Gonal F, suppression with Cetrotide and a Lupron trigger.

When the doctor called me with the results he made it sound like there was no hope for us and that we need to consider donor eggs. He told us that as well as the sperm issue, we may also have an egg quality issue. 

We are changing doctors because we are moving to a new city next month as I have a new (dream) job. Thank god I didn't turn down the offer - I was very close to rejecting it because of this IVF cycle. My new company has infertility coverage up to $20,000 so we will be trying again. We do not want to use donor eggs. 

Has anyone experienced this and have gone onto have success with a different protocol? I keep reading a lot about DNA fragmentation and Zymot. I'm not sure if the clinics in our new city offer this. Has this made a difference? Our doctor downplayed the importance of DNA frag as he feels that any sperm issues can be bypassed with ICSI. We won't be trying again for another 5-6 months because I want to settle into my new job. So would losing weight help? What can my husband do to improve his sperm? 

How can we move on from this? We are devastated. I haven't stopped crying since I got the phone call. I'm just so angry and hurt. How do you cope with this pain?

Last cycle was 2.5 dose of Letrozole + Ovidrel trigger. It took 20 days from when I started the Letrozole to get to a trigger. My RE said my follicle growth was slower than expected which led to lots of monitoring apts and quite a rollercoaster of emotions. 

This cycle they are upping me to 2 pills (dose of 5) per day. Wondering if any of you have upped the dose and if it helped move the follicle growth along any quicker? Was the timing of your triggers consistent from cycle to cycle?

**For those who do not have a subscription the text:**

The first time a doctor told Gina Balzano that she was too fat to have a baby was in 2013. She was 32, weighed 317 pounds and had been trying to get pregnant since soon after she and her husband, Nick, married in 2010. Balzano — whom I have known since high school — lives in Waltham, Mass., and works in special education. She’s the kind of person whom others often go to with their problems, but her own predicament, after three years of negative pregnancy tests, had left her feeling overwhelmed. “I’ve always had horrible, heavy, painful periods, so I thought something was wrong,” she says. “But I didn’t know enough to know what to worry about.” She told herself it was time to find out.

The couple braced themselves to hear some painful truths about fertility treatments. On average, a single cycle of in vitro fertilization costs between $10,000 and $15,000 — and that doesn’t include medications, follow-up visits or the expenses of prenatal care and childbirth. Just 10 states have a law requiring insurance companies to pay for I.V.F., and that coverage varies. The couple also knew that the experience of undergoing fertility treatments would be emotionally draining. And Balzano expected to hear about her size. She didn’t have any of the health conditions often associated with a high body weight; her blood pressure and cholesterol levels were normal, and she didn’t have diabetes or other chronic ailments. Nevertheless, it was the rare doctor who didn’t raise the subject. “When you’re fat, you get used to people assuming weight loss will fix everything wrong in your life,” Balzano says.

Conception requires four events to unfold perfectly: An ovary must release an egg; a sperm must reach and fertilize that egg; the fertilized egg must then travel through a woman’s fallopian tube and into her uterus; and finally, it must remain in the uterus, anchored in place, as it grows into a healthy fetus. Infertility results when something goes amiss during any of these steps. Reproductive endocrinologists — ob-gyns who have undergone training in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility — can facilitate the process by stimulating ovulation with drugs. If that doesn’t work, they can artificially inseminate patients or they can remove both sperm and egg, produce an embryo in a lab (the “in vitro” part of I.V.F.) and implant it back into a woman’s uterus.

During their first appointment at a large Boston fertility clinic, Balzano says, the reproductive endocrinologist was cold and unsmiling as she reviewed the couple’s medical history. Her first question was whether Balzano was ovulating. Irregular ovulation — when a woman’s ovaries fail to release eggs during the appropriate phase of the menstrual cycle — is one of the most common causes of infertility. Balzano wasn’t sure; it was difficult to track her erratic cycles at home. The specialist asked no follow-up questions. “It’s your weight,” she said.

The doctor, Balzano was convinced, had reduced her to a single characteristic. “I was like, ‘Wait, wait, wait, there might be something else wrong,’ ” she recalls. “My mom isn’t morbidly obese, but she only had one pregnancy, and she was never on birth control. Couldn’t there be something else going on here?” Nick was furious. “I know plenty of larger women who have been pregnant without any problems,” he says. “This didn’t make any sense.” But they both say the doctor, who declined my interview request on the basis of patient confidentiality, was adamant. “I would never give you I.V.F.,” they recall her saying. “You’re too fat. Have more sex and lose the weight.”

Although Balzano didn’t know it when she made the appointment, the clinic that would have performed the procedure had a policy against providing I.V.F. to patients with a body mass index above 45; Gina’s was 51.2. In that decision, it followed much of the fertility industry, including half of the 20 largest clinics in the United States, according to FertilityIQ, an online clearinghouse of information on fertility providers nationwide. At some clinics, the cutoff for treatment is a B.M.I. of 50, often classified as “extreme” or “severe” obesity (roughly 300 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman). At others, it’s much lower. Chelsea Ritchie, now the mother of twins in Ham Lake, Minn., got a call from a nurse the day before her initial appointment with a fertility doctor in 2011. “She said, ‘The doctor only sees patients with a B.M.I. under 30, so you’ll need to lose 22 pounds,’ ” Ritchie recalls. (The doctor told me that his cutoff for seeing patients is actually a B.M.I. of 35, though he won’t do I.V.F. unless they’re under 30. Ritchie subsequently conceived her twins after going to a different clinic.) B.M.I. doesn’t factor in gender, age or muscle mass, all of which influence body composition and health. But the World Health Organization adopted the B.M.I. scale as an official classification in 1995, and it has since become medicine’s standard metric for categorizing patients by weight. A B.M.I. of 30 or above is classified as “obese,” the word still used by doctors, researchers and the media, although surveys of larger patients show that most consider it derogatory; many now reclaim the once-offensive “fat.”

The belief that a high body weight causes infertility, and its corollary — that weight loss is necessary to resolve infertility — underpin almost every interaction a heavy woman will have with the reproductive health care industry. Yet the specialty’s two governing organizations, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, have not established any guidelines on whether treatment should be declined on the basis of weight. And as the percentage of American women categorized as obese has grown to 41.1 percent in 2016 from 25.4 in 1994, some doctors are pushing back against the notion that weight loss should ever be, in effect, a prerequisite for motherhood. “I think we’ve been overexaggerating the benefits of preconception weight loss,” says Dr. Richard S. Legro, a professor of public health services and chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Penn State University. In fact, a fixation on weight may be leading health care astray. “Many providers see a larger woman and say things like, ‘Don’t eat cheeseburgers,’ even though she’s a vegetarian,” says Sharon Bernecki DeJoy, the director of public health at West Chester University who studies maternity care in the United States. “There’s a lack of recognition of evidence that shows you can be healthy and still have a, quote-unquote, unhealthy B.M.I.” And a lack of recognition that when a heavy person does get sick, it might not be because of weight.

When I knew Balzano back in high school, she was a quirky, glitter-covered theater kid who wrote plays about fairy tales. We lost touch for years after graduation, until our early 30s, when we began to run into each other once a year at the New York State Sheep and Wool Festival. The first few times I saw her, she was heavy, just as she had been when we were kids. Then suddenly, in 2016, she was much less so. A few weeks later I learned why. “I cut off 70 percent of my stomach so I could have the chance to be treated for infertility,” she wrote in an email.

At the festival, Balzano stocked up on yarn to make tiny sweaters and hats for friends’ babies. During our interviews, we often veered off course while she sorted through my struggles with potty training or tantrum management. Even though I was already a mother and she wasn’t, Balzano had more experience in navigating such milestones through her work as a special-ed teacher. In so many ways, Balzano had been maternal as long as I’ve known her. But motherhood is both an emotional state and an embodied one, and a doctor had said Balzano’s body wasn’t right for the job. In this respect, B.M.I. cutoffs become more than tools to promote patient health. They also become a way in which doctors might be settling the question: Which women’s bodies are worthy of carrying a child?

In 1952, a pair of Boston physicians published a study in The New England Journal of Medicine titled “The Relation of Obesity to Menstrual Disturbances.” The authors surveyed 100 women between the ages of 16 and 40 who had been given diagnoses of menstrual disorders and compared their weights with a control group with no reproductive health issues. Forty-three percent of the patients with menstrual disorders weighed 20 percent or more than their “ideal weight,” compared with just 13 percent of the control subjects. Their findings, the authors concluded, gave “factual proof to the clinical impression of the association of obesity and menstrual disturbances.”

Ever since, the idea that a high body mass contributes to infertility has been an accepted premise. “There’s no question — it’s been validated in a number of studies,” says Alan Penzias, a former surgical director for Boston I.V.F., a national chain of fertility clinics, and an associate professor of reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School. In 2007, researchers combed through data collected on 7,327 pregnancies from 1959 to 1965 and found that it took heavier women a median of one to two months longer to conceive, compared with women with B.M.I.s in the “normal weight” range. A 2015 study of 1,602 Italian women undergoing I.V.F. found that the bigger women were just as likely to get pregnant, but were more likely to miscarry. All in all, the research shows a correlating decline in successful pregnancy rates as B.M.I. rises.

Penzias’s clinic employs a tiered cutoff system and begins counseling patients about the importance of weight loss when their B.M.I. is 30, though it will still treat women whose B.M.I.s are higher, up to 45. Doctors say prescribing diet and exercise seems to be a logical place to start before moving up the treatment ladder to expensive drugs, blood work, imaging tests and, if a patient’s case warrants I.V.F., at least one minor operation. And whatever stalls ovulation, losing weight often appears to restart it. This was documented by a 1995 study published in the journal Human Reproduction, in which 13 overweight women who were not ovulating were assigned to a weight-loss program. Six months later, they had lost an average of 13.8 pounds, and all but one of them had resumed ovulating. Eleven became pregnant.

To critics of B.M.I. exclusions, the potential benefits of weight loss are outstripped by how difficult it is for patients to sustain. Studies on dieting show that people lose, at best, 5 to 10 percent of their body weight, and most will regain that within five years. “If a patient starts with a B.M.I. of 50 and now she’s at 45, does that make much difference?” Legro asks. In the meanwhile, he points out, the patient has lost crucial time. In 2017, when Swedish researchers put 160 high-weight women on a liquid diet for 12 weeks before starting I.V.F., resulting in a median loss of 20 pounds, they were no more likely to conceive than a control group.

Some aspects of fertility treatment can be more complicated for larger patients. Retrieving eggs for I.V.F. requires that a patient be sedated while a doctor uses an ultrasound probe to identify and extract eggs. “With an obese patient, I sometimes have to go in through her abdomen instead of her vagina, and I might not be able to retrieve as many eggs,” says Rachel Ashby, a reproductive endocrinologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. This lowers the patient’s odds of success.

But to Linda Bacon, an associate nutritionist at the University of California, Davis, and author of the book “Health at Every Size,” trying to assess the odds is beside the point, because doctors’ jobs are to treat the patient in front of them. “Even if it is causative (and it may be), people still deserve the right to good health care,” she emailed me to say. “Health care needs to take care of our lived bodies, regardless of size.”

Balzano believes she would have been annoyed, but far less devastated, if the doctor she saw had explained that their clinic wasn’t set up to handle her case. “That would have felt kinder and more ethical, but the implication was, ‘It’s irresponsible of you to want to have a baby at this size,’ ” she says. Jen McLellan, an activist and childbirth educator who writes a blog called Plus Size Birth, gets similar stories from her 172,000 Facebook followers: “I have heard from women of size who have been told to abort their babies.”

This is where the conversation about risk and responsibility turns. It’s no longer about what a woman is willing to inflict on herself — it’s about whether she might jeopardize her not-yet-conceived offspring. “We police women over their fitness to become a mother,” DeJoy says. “ ‘Are you drinking, are you smoking, do you have enough money and a partner?’ And if you’re a larger woman, it’s: ‘You don’t know how to eat and exercise. You’ll raise that kid to be fat.’ ”

So just how dangerous is it for a larger woman to have a baby? “The majority of the obstetricians we work with have said, ‘We support you standing up to this,’ ” says Dr. Bill Meyer, a founder of Carolina Conceptions, a fertility clinic in Raleigh, N.C. His clinic does not perform I.V.F. on patients with B.M.I.s above 37.5, and it does not prescribe fertility-stimulating medications to patients above 40. He points to how rates of prenatal conditions like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, as well as miscarriages and stillbirths, all increase as a patient’s B.M.I. climbs. Larger patients are at greater risk for airway obstruction and more likely to require intubation. “This has nothing to do with the fertility side,” Penzias says. “If they developed a complication under anesthesia, we’d have to transport them to a hospital.” In total, large women undergoing in vitro fertilization are 10 percent less likely to carry a pregnancy to full-term than women with lower B.M.I.s, according to a 2012 analysis of 27 studies.

“You can try to explain as much as possible to patients,” Meyer says. “But sometimes you say, ‘This is the best I can do with informed consent, and I’m just going to have to put my foot down.’ ”

“Informed consent” is a process doctors use to educate their patients about the potential risks and benefits of treatments so that patients can make reasoned decisions about their care. It’s supposed to foster a partnership between patient and doctor, though doctors are allowed to initiate treatment without informed consent in an emergency, according to the American Medical Association’s code of ethics. The code also states that the doctor’s obligation to respect patient autonomy “does not mean that patients should receive specific interventions simply because they (or their surrogates) request them.” The A.M.A. then lists situations where a doctor is allowed to decline treatment, including when the physician “lacks the resources to provide safe, competent or respectful care for the individual.” But the code also notes that physicians are not allowed to turn down patients “on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity, or other personal or social characteristics that are not clinically relevant to the individual’s care.”

“I wouldn’t go so far as to say we understand why maternal weight is associated with” negative outcomes, says Dr. Chloe Zera, a maternal fetal medicine specialist who cares for patients during high-risk pregnancies at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “Obesity can require special care, but a majority of women with B.M.I. over 30 don’t have a complicated pregnancy and do have healthy babies.” Even when the risk for complications increases, the frequency of such events remains low. When Stanford University researchers analyzed more than 1.1 million birth records in California, they found the overall prevalence of stillbirths to be five per 1,000 deliveries. Among women with a B.M.I. above 30, the rate ranged from seven to 10 stillbirths per 1,000 deliveries — as much as a twofold increase, but still a rare event. In comparison, a 2008 evidence review of the relationship between maternal age and stillbirth risk found that thinner women over 35 were also almost twice as likely to have a stillborn delivery compared with their younger counterparts. And the Stanford study could not establish a causal relationship. Stillbirths may correlate with B.M.I. because it may be harder for doctors to detect fetal complications in bigger bodies as a result of technological limitations. Larger women may also receive less careful prenatal care. When researchers analyzed audio recordings of prenatal appointments between 22 providers and 117 pregnant women, they found that providers treating patients with higher B.M.I.s asked them fewer questions about their lifestyle habits and shared less information, according to data published in 2017 in the journal Patient Education and Counseling.

All that can be said with any confidence, according to Legro, at Penn State, is that “there is no B.M.I. cut-point above which it is absolutely unsafe to have a pregnancy.” And weight loss does not ensure a safer pregnancy. When Scandinavian researchers linked data on bariatric surgery patients with infant health outcomes, they found that women who went through such procedures were more likely to have preterm deliveries and babies who were small for their gestational age than mothers of any weight who had not undergone the surgery. “Patients are told to lose weight to have a healthy baby,” Legro says. “But it’s possible that by doing so, you may be at higher risk for complications than you were before.”

One day when Balzano was 19, she walked out of a gas station and a man in a passing car yelled, “Fat bastard!” “That was the moment when I realized my body was this problem for the entire world,” she recalls. Studies dating back to the 1960s have shown that when children are presented with pictures of other kids with various body types, they rate the fat body as the one they like the least. In 2013, Yale University researchers asked 74 study participants to read a published news article about Canadian physicians who wanted to deny fertility treatments to women with obese B.M.I.s. One-third of the study subjects read the article alongside an image of a large couple eating junk food; the rest saw the same couple sitting on a bench holding hands or no accompanying image. When researchers surveyed the readers, those who had seen the junk food were more likely than the rest to support the doctors’ decision to deny fertility treatment to such patients.

Good health is often equated with being a disciplined person, a responsible citizen, a worthier mother. And stereotypes — like the assumption that all fat people are gluttonous and willfully large — can shape our understanding of a person’s health and morality. “We all have cultural biases, and health care providers are people, too,” DeJoy says. Studies have indicated that doctors across all specialties are more likely to consider an overweight patient uncooperative, less compliant and even less intelligent than a thinner counterpart. An Australian study on prenatal health care found that doctors expressed less sympathy and approval for their larger pregnant patients. “Until I found my doula and midwife, I had never had a medical professional touch my body with compassion,” says McLellan, who identifies as a fat woman and had a healthy pregnancy. “That feels normal to a person of size.”

Weight-science researchers are aware of how that lack of compassion can have health consequences. The kind of stigma that women like McLellan and Balzano encounter throughout their lives puts fat people at higher risk for depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. They also have higher blood pressure and higher levels of stress hormones. And many researchers documenting these risks control for B.M.I. when they collect their data. “This tells us that it’s stigma, rather than one’s weight per se, that contributes to these adverse health outcomes,” says Rebecca Puhl, an author of the 2013 Yale study and the deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. “This evidence also challenges the notion that stigma will motivate people to lose weight.”

Balzano’s husband, Nick, was eager to get a second opinion right away, but it was two years before she could bring herself to see another doctor. “I couldn’t take another conversation like that,” she says. “I felt like this waste of a person.” In private, she sobbed whenever friends announced a pregnancy. Then one friend, who was also heavy, told Balzano that she’d had a good experience at Boston I.V.F. So they made an appointment. When they arrived, a concierge greeted the couple as soon as they walked in. Balzano responded by starting to cry. The place felt too slick and fancy. She was sure she would once again be deemed unfit.

The doctor listened to Balzano’s story and said she understood how emotional the situation was. But she did want Balzano to lose weight. In the meantime, she was willing to prescribe letrozole, a medication used to promote ovulation, or, if that failed, a course of intrauterine insemination. I.U.I. is a low-risk procedure done without sedation in the doctor’s office; sperm is placed inside the patient’s uterus during ovulation in order to facilitate fertilization. “But it didn’t seem like she was all that interested in that,” Nick says. “The impression I got was that nobody thinks anything besides I.V.F. will work, and they wouldn’t give Gina I.V.F.” The doctor told me she recalls that she was “certainly willing to go ahead with medication and insemination,” but says she counseled Balzano to see a maternal fetal medicine specialist to discuss the potential impact of her weight on a pregnancy. Balzano declined the letrozole: “Essentially, she was saying the same thing as the first doctor — that nothing would change until I fixed my weight.”

Even when they do receive fertility treatment, women in larger bodies may encounter stigma in how a reproductive endocrinologist approaches their care. Stephanie Robben, 44, and the mother of twin boys in St. Louis, says her doctor didn’t mention her weight — then 247 pounds — until the first I.V.F. cycle failed. Then he outlined a daily plan for her: Drink a gallon of water, eat fewer than 900 calories and exercise for an hour. If Robben followed these directions correctly, the doctor expected her to lose 50 pounds in a month, much more than the monthly rate of four to eight pounds considered safe by major health organizations. Such extreme dieting can lead to dangerous electrolyte imbalances, dehydration — and irregular menstruation. “Rapid weight loss achieved by crash diets or excessive exercise is detrimental to reproductive outcomes during fertility treatments,” British researchers concluded in a 2010 issue of the Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences.

“By the end of the second day, I couldn’t even formulate a sentence,” Robben says. “All I could think about was a piece of chicken breast in my fridge.” By the end of the month, she had lost 20 pounds. The next round of I.V.F. failed as well. (Her doctor declined to comment for this article.) Robben later conceived her twins after seeing a different doctor, and without losing additional weight.

Meyer, of Carolina Conceptions, objects to the idea that weight stigma, not health concern, motivates clinics to require weight loss. “There are tears in these conversations,” he acknowledges. “But most of the time, I feel pretty good after sitting down with these patients. I think we almost overcompensate so we’re not judged as being biased toward weight.” When Meyer’s clinic turns away a patient based on B.M.I., it offers a referral to a local weight-loss program. He estimates that around 60 percent of those women follow through. “The patients who then come back to us \[for treatment\] are very thankful that they’ve made those changes,” he says. “Or their husband will say, ‘Thank you for talking to her about that.’ ”

Meyer admits that he doesn’t know what happens to the patients who don’t return. But those are the patients whom Rachel Ashby, at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, worries about most. “There probably is a subset of women out there who stop seeking treatment because they are aware that they may feel marginalized in the doctor’s office,” she says. “They feel this sense of ‘I can’t pursue this anymore,’ and just live quietly with infertility.’ ”

Balzano didn’t want to live quietly anymore. After the appointment, she says, “I reconciled myself to having weight-loss surgery pretty much that moment.” Bariatric surgery patients can lose 25 to 35 percent of their original weight, and keep it off longer than dieters do — making it the most enduring form of weight loss available. But many patients develop vitamin deficiencies because of their limited diets. And female patients are told it’s not safe to become pregnant for at least one year. The operation would cause Balzano to lose yet more time.

To Balzano’s doctors, this decision was a rational attempt to take control of her health and fertility. The couple see it as her required sacrifice. “We couldn’t achieve this goal because people didn’t like the way she looked,” says Nick, who was anxious about the surgery’s risks. Balzano recalls: “I was at the point where I would cut off a limb to have a baby. So fine, why not my stomach?” Balzano had her operation in December 2015. When we talked a year later, she told me how she had survived the first months consuming only liquids, and then, tiny portions of fat-free refried beans. Her B.M.I. was down to 32.1. Balzano got Ashby’s name from her bariatric surgeon and made an appointment for January 2017.

Balzano was now 37. However many high-quality eggs she’d had when she began trying to conceive at 30, there were thousands fewer now. “We have to get started,” Ashby told Balzano. “In fact, I would have begun treatment when you were at your highest weight.” Nick’s eyes bulged. “So we spent a ton of money and a ton of pain and we could have done this five years ago?” he asked. When we spoke the next day, Balzano was trying to remain calm about the revelation. “Look, it’s done; I’m in a good place,” she said of her surgery. “But I can understand why someone in my position might be incandescent with rage right now.”

Ashby told me that she would have treated Balzano at 340 pounds because she was in good health then. She doesn’t think weight was the primary cause of Balzano’s infertility, because the couple remained unable to conceive even after her surgical weight loss. “Patients often ask me, ‘If I were a normal B.M.I., would I be fertile?’ Often, that answer is no,” Ashby says. “And absent some grave risk to a patient, it’s paternalistic to say to a 35-year-old woman, ‘Go lose a hundred pounds.’ ”

Massachusetts health care law requires couples to try three rounds of intrauterine insemination before insurance will cover the cost of I.V.F. The first attempt failed, as everyone expected, but in November 2017, I heard from Balzano: “Just got a positive pregnancy test.” The second round of I.U.I. had worked. Logan Anthony was born on June 5, 2018, five weeks early but healthy. “I’m enjoying all the little moments daily, even the diapers,” Balzano told me, shortly after Logan turned 6 months old. “It’s still sinking in that I’m someone’s mom.”",t2_of6ol,False,,0,False,"Great NYT infertility article titled ""When you're told your're too fat to get pregnent""",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_c2r16h,False,dark,0.9,,public,49,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,49,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1561030896.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>A really great science-informed article on infertility treatment and weight that touches on some of the horrible experiences that a number of our members seeking infertility treatments face because of their BMI.

<p><strong>For those who do not have a subscription the text:</strong></p>

<p>The first time a doctor told Gina Balzano that she was too fat to have a baby was in 2013. She was 32, weighed 317 pounds and had been trying to get pregnant since soon after she and her husband, Nick, married in 2010. Balzano — whom I have known since high school — lives in Waltham, Mass., and works in special education. She’s the kind of person whom others often go to with their problems, but her own predicament, after three years of negative pregnancy tests, had left her feeling overwhelmed. “I’ve always had horrible, heavy, painful periods, so I thought something was wrong,” she says. “But I didn’t know enough to know what to worry about.” She told herself it was time to find out.</p>

<p>The couple braced themselves to hear some painful truths about fertility treatments. On average, a single cycle of in vitro fertilization costs between $10,000 and $15,000 — and that doesn’t include medications, follow-up visits or the expenses of prenatal care and childbirth. Just 10 states have a law requiring insurance companies to pay for I.V.F., and that coverage varies. The couple also knew that the experience of undergoing fertility treatments would be emotionally draining. And Balzano expected to hear about her size. She didn’t have any of the health conditions often associated with a high body weight; her blood pressure and cholesterol levels were normal, and she didn’t have diabetes or other chronic ailments. Nevertheless, it was the rare doctor who didn’t raise the subject. “When you’re fat, you get used to people assuming weight loss will fix everything wrong in your life,” Balzano says.</p>

<p>Conception requires four events to unfold perfectly: An ovary must release an egg; a sperm must reach and fertilize that egg; the fertilized egg must then travel through a woman’s fallopian tube and into her uterus; and finally, it must remain in the uterus, anchored in place, as it grows into a healthy fetus. Infertility results when something goes amiss during any of these steps. Reproductive endocrinologists — ob-gyns who have undergone training in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility — can facilitate the process by stimulating ovulation with drugs. If that doesn’t work, they can artificially inseminate patients or they can remove both sperm and egg, produce an embryo in a lab (the “in vitro” part of I.V.F.) and implant it back into a woman’s uterus.</p>

<p>During their first appointment at a large Boston fertility clinic, Balzano says, the reproductive endocrinologist was cold and unsmiling as she reviewed the couple’s medical history. Her first question was whether Balzano was ovulating. Irregular ovulation — when a woman’s ovaries fail to release eggs during the appropriate phase of the menstrual cycle — is one of the most common causes of infertility. Balzano wasn’t sure; it was difficult to track her erratic cycles at home. The specialist asked no follow-up questions. “It’s your weight,” she said.</p>

<p>The doctor, Balzano was convinced, had reduced her to a single characteristic. “I was like, ‘Wait, wait, wait, there might be something else wrong,’ ” she recalls. “My mom isn’t morbidly obese, but she only had one pregnancy, and she was never on birth control. Couldn’t there be something else going on here?” Nick was furious. “I know plenty of larger women who have been pregnant without any problems,” he says. “This didn’t make any sense.” But they both say the doctor, who declined my interview request on the basis of patient confidentiality, was adamant. “I would never give you I.V.F.,” they recall her saying. “You’re too fat. Have more sex and lose the weight.”</p>

<p>Although Balzano didn’t know it when she made the appointment, the clinic that would have performed the procedure had a policy against providing I.V.F. to patients with a body mass index above 45; Gina’s was 51.2. In that decision, it followed much of the fertility industry, including half of the 20 largest clinics in the United States, according to FertilityIQ, an online clearinghouse of information on fertility providers nationwide. At some clinics, the cutoff for treatment is a B.M.I. of 50, often classified as “extreme” or “severe” obesity (roughly 300 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman). At others, it’s much lower. Chelsea Ritchie, now the mother of twins in Ham Lake, Minn., got a call from a nurse the day before her initial appointment with a fertility doctor in 2011. “She said, ‘The doctor only sees patients with a B.M.I. under 30, so you’ll need to lose 22 pounds,’ ” Ritchie recalls. (The doctor told me that his cutoff for seeing patients is actually a B.M.I. of 35, though he won’t do I.V.F. unless they’re under 30. Ritchie subsequently conceived her twins after going to a different clinic.) B.M.I. doesn’t factor in gender, age or muscle mass, all of which influence body composition and health. But the World Health Organization adopted the B.M.I. scale as an official classification in 1995, and it has since become medicine’s standard metric for categorizing patients by weight. A B.M.I. of 30 or above is classified as “obese,” the word still used by doctors, researchers and the media, although surveys of larger patients show that most consider it derogatory; many now reclaim the once-offensive “fat.”</p>

<p>The belief that a high body weight causes infertility, and its corollary — that weight loss is necessary to resolve infertility — underpin almost every interaction a heavy woman will have with the reproductive health care industry. Yet the specialty’s two governing organizations, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, have not established any guidelines on whether treatment should be declined on the basis of weight. And as the percentage of American women categorized as obese has grown to 41.1 percent in 2016 from 25.4 in 1994, some doctors are pushing back against the notion that weight loss should ever be, in effect, a prerequisite for motherhood. “I think we’ve been overexaggerating the benefits of preconception weight loss,” says Dr. Richard S. Legro, a professor of public health services and chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Penn State University. In fact, a fixation on weight may be leading health care astray. “Many providers see a larger woman and say things like, ‘Don’t eat cheeseburgers,’ even though she’s a vegetarian,” says Sharon Bernecki DeJoy, the director of public health at West Chester University who studies maternity care in the United States. “There’s a lack of recognition of evidence that shows you can be healthy and still have a, quote-unquote, unhealthy B.M.I.” And a lack of recognition that when a heavy person does get sick, it might not be because of weight.</p>

<p>When I knew Balzano back in high school, she was a quirky, glitter-covered theater kid who wrote plays about fairy tales. We lost touch for years after graduation, until our early 30s, when we began to run into each other once a year at the New York State Sheep and Wool Festival. The first few times I saw her, she was heavy, just as she had been when we were kids. Then suddenly, in 2016, she was much less so. A few weeks later I learned why. “I cut off 70 percent of my stomach so I could have the chance to be treated for infertility,” she wrote in an email.</p>

<p>At the festival, Balzano stocked up on yarn to make tiny sweaters and hats for friends’ babies. During our interviews, we often veered off course while she sorted through my struggles with potty training or tantrum management. Even though I was already a mother and she wasn’t, Balzano had more experience in navigating such milestones through her work as a special-ed teacher. In so many ways, Balzano had been maternal as long as I’ve known her. But motherhood is both an emotional state and an embodied one, and a doctor had said Balzano’s body wasn’t right for the job. In this respect, B.M.I. cutoffs become more than tools to promote patient health. They also become a way in which doctors might be settling the question: Which women’s bodies are worthy of carrying a child?</p>

<p>In 1952, a pair of Boston physicians published a study in The New England Journal of Medicine titled “The Relation of Obesity to Menstrual Disturbances.” The authors surveyed 100 women between the ages of 16 and 40 who had been given diagnoses of menstrual disorders and compared their weights with a control group with no reproductive health issues. Forty-three percent of the patients with menstrual disorders weighed 20 percent or more than their “ideal weight,” compared with just 13 percent of the control subjects. Their findings, the authors concluded, gave “factual proof to the clinical impression of the association of obesity and menstrual disturbances.”</p>

<p>Ever since, the idea that a high body mass contributes to infertility has been an accepted premise. “There’s no question — it’s been validated in a number of studies,” says Alan Penzias, a former surgical director for Boston I.V.F., a national chain of fertility clinics, and an associate professor of reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School. In 2007, researchers combed through data collected on 7,327 pregnancies from 1959 to 1965 and found that it took heavier women a median of one to two months longer to conceive, compared with women with B.M.I.s in the “normal weight” range. A 2015 study of 1,602 Italian women undergoing I.V.F. found that the bigger women were just as likely to get pregnant, but were more likely to miscarry. All in all, the research shows a correlating decline in successful pregnancy rates as B.M.I. rises.</p>

<p>Penzias’s clinic employs a tiered cutoff system and begins counseling patients about the importance of weight loss when their B.M.I. is 30, though it will still treat women whose B.M.I.s are higher, up to 45. Doctors say prescribing diet and exercise seems to be a logical place to start before moving up the treatment ladder to expensive drugs, blood work, imaging tests and, if a patient’s case warrants I.V.F., at least one minor operation. And whatever stalls ovulation, losing weight often appears to restart it. This was documented by a 1995 study published in the journal Human Reproduction, in which 13 overweight women who were not ovulating were assigned to a weight-loss program. Six months later, they had lost an average of 13.8 pounds, and all but one of them had resumed ovulating. Eleven became pregnant.</p>

<p>To critics of B.M.I. exclusions, the potential benefits of weight loss are outstripped by how difficult it is for patients to sustain. Studies on dieting show that people lose, at best, 5 to 10 percent of their body weight, and most will regain that within five years. “If a patient starts with a B.M.I. of 50 and now she’s at 45, does that make much difference?” Legro asks. In the meanwhile, he points out, the patient has lost crucial time. In 2017, when Swedish researchers put 160 high-weight women on a liquid diet for 12 weeks before starting I.V.F., resulting in a median loss of 20 pounds, they were no more likely to conceive than a control group.</p>

<p>Some aspects of fertility treatment can be more complicated for larger patients. Retrieving eggs for I.V.F. requires that a patient be sedated while a doctor uses an ultrasound probe to identify and extract eggs. “With an obese patient, I sometimes have to go in through her abdomen instead of her vagina, and I might not be able to retrieve as many eggs,” says Rachel Ashby, a reproductive endocrinologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. This lowers the patient’s odds of success.</p>

<p>But to Linda Bacon, an associate nutritionist at the University of California, Davis, and author of the book “Health at Every Size,” trying to assess the odds is beside the point, because doctors’ jobs are to treat the patient in front of them. “Even if it is causative (and it may be), people still deserve the right to good health care,” she emailed me to say. “Health care needs to take care of our lived bodies, regardless of size.”</p>

<p>Balzano believes she would have been annoyed, but far less devastated, if the doctor she saw had explained that their clinic wasn’t set up to handle her case. “That would have felt kinder and more ethical, but the implication was, ‘It’s irresponsible of you to want to have a baby at this size,’ ” she says. Jen McLellan, an activist and childbirth educator who writes a blog called Plus Size Birth, gets similar stories from her 172,000 Facebook followers: “I have heard from women of size who have been told to abort their babies.”</p>

<p>This is where the conversation about risk and responsibility turns. It’s no longer about what a woman is willing to inflict on herself — it’s about whether she might jeopardize her not-yet-conceived offspring. “We police women over their fitness to become a mother,” DeJoy says. “ ‘Are you drinking, are you smoking, do you have enough money and a partner?’ And if you’re a larger woman, it’s: ‘You don’t know how to eat and exercise. You’ll raise that kid to be fat.’ ”</p>

<p>So just how dangerous is it for a larger woman to have a baby? “The majority of the obstetricians we work with have said, ‘We support you standing up to this,’ ” says Dr. Bill Meyer, a founder of Carolina Conceptions, a fertility clinic in Raleigh, N.C. His clinic does not perform I.V.F. on patients with B.M.I.s above 37.5, and it does not prescribe fertility-stimulating medications to patients above 40. He points to how rates of prenatal conditions like gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, as well as miscarriages and stillbirths, all increase as a patient’s B.M.I. climbs. Larger patients are at greater risk for airway obstruction and more likely to require intubation. “This has nothing to do with the fertility side,” Penzias says. “If they developed a complication under anesthesia, we’d have to transport them to a hospital.” In total, large women undergoing in vitro fertilization are 10 percent less likely to carry a pregnancy to full-term than women with lower B.M.I.s, according to a 2012 analysis of 27 studies.</p>

<p>“You can try to explain as much as possible to patients,” Meyer says. “But sometimes you say, ‘This is the best I can do with informed consent, and I’m just going to have to put my foot down.’ ”</p>

<p>“Informed consent” is a process doctors use to educate their patients about the potential risks and benefits of treatments so that patients can make reasoned decisions about their care. It’s supposed to foster a partnership between patient and doctor, though doctors are allowed to initiate treatment without informed consent in an emergency, according to the American Medical Association’s code of ethics. The code also states that the doctor’s obligation to respect patient autonomy “does not mean that patients should receive specific interventions simply because they (or their surrogates) request them.” The A.M.A. then lists situations where a doctor is allowed to decline treatment, including when the physician “lacks the resources to provide safe, competent or respectful care for the individual.” But the code also notes that physicians are not allowed to turn down patients “on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity, or other personal or social characteristics that are not clinically relevant to the individual’s care.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go so far as to say we understand why maternal weight is associated with” negative outcomes, says Dr. Chloe Zera, a maternal fetal medicine specialist who cares for patients during high-risk pregnancies at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “Obesity can require special care, but a majority of women with B.M.I. over 30 don’t have a complicated pregnancy and do have healthy babies.” Even when the risk for complications increases, the frequency of such events remains low. When Stanford University researchers analyzed more than 1.1 million birth records in California, they found the overall prevalence of stillbirths to be five per 1,000 deliveries. Among women with a B.M.I. above 30, the rate ranged from seven to 10 stillbirths per 1,000 deliveries — as much as a twofold increase, but still a rare event. In comparison, a 2008 evidence review of the relationship between maternal age and stillbirth risk found that thinner women over 35 were also almost twice as likely to have a stillborn delivery compared with their younger counterparts. And the Stanford study could not establish a causal relationship. Stillbirths may correlate with B.M.I. because it may be harder for doctors to detect fetal complications in bigger bodies as a result of technological limitations. Larger women may also receive less careful prenatal care. When researchers analyzed audio recordings of prenatal appointments between 22 providers and 117 pregnant women, they found that providers treating patients with higher B.M.I.s asked them fewer questions about their lifestyle habits and shared less information, according to data published in 2017 in the journal Patient Education and Counseling.</p>

<p>All that can be said with any confidence, according to Legro, at Penn State, is that “there is no B.M.I. cut-point above which it is absolutely unsafe to have a pregnancy.” And weight loss does not ensure a safer pregnancy. When Scandinavian researchers linked data on bariatric surgery patients with infant health outcomes, they found that women who went through such procedures were more likely to have preterm deliveries and babies who were small for their gestational age than mothers of any weight who had not undergone the surgery. “Patients are told to lose weight to have a healthy baby,” Legro says. “But it’s possible that by doing so, you may be at higher risk for complications than you were before.”</p>

<p>One day when Balzano was 19, she walked out of a gas station and a man in a passing car yelled, “Fat bastard!” “That was the moment when I realized my body was this problem for the entire world,” she recalls. Studies dating back to the 1960s have shown that when children are presented with pictures of other kids with various body types, they rate the fat body as the one they like the least. In 2013, Yale University researchers asked 74 study participants to read a published news article about Canadian physicians who wanted to deny fertility treatments to women with obese B.M.I.s. One-third of the study subjects read the article alongside an image of a large couple eating junk food; the rest saw the same couple sitting on a bench holding hands or no accompanying image. When researchers surveyed the readers, those who had seen the junk food were more likely than the rest to support the doctors’ decision to deny fertility treatment to such patients.</p>

<p>Good health is often equated with being a disciplined person, a responsible citizen, a worthier mother. And stereotypes — like the assumption that all fat people are gluttonous and willfully large — can shape our understanding of a person’s health and morality. “We all have cultural biases, and health care providers are people, too,” DeJoy says. Studies have indicated that doctors across all specialties are more likely to consider an overweight patient uncooperative, less compliant and even less intelligent than a thinner counterpart. An Australian study on prenatal health care found that doctors expressed less sympathy and approval for their larger pregnant patients. “Until I found my doula and midwife, I had never had a medical professional touch my body with compassion,” says McLellan, who identifies as a fat woman and had a healthy pregnancy. “That feels normal to a person of size.”</p>

<p>Weight-science researchers are aware of how that lack of compassion can have health consequences. The kind of stigma that women like McLellan and Balzano encounter throughout their lives puts fat people at higher risk for depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. They also have higher blood pressure and higher levels of stress hormones. And many researchers documenting these risks control for B.M.I. when they collect their data. “This tells us that it’s stigma, rather than one’s weight per se, that contributes to these adverse health outcomes,” says Rebecca Puhl, an author of the 2013 Yale study and the deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. “This evidence also challenges the notion that stigma will motivate people to lose weight.”</p>

<p>Balzano’s husband, Nick, was eager to get a second opinion right away, but it was two years before she could bring herself to see another doctor. “I couldn’t take another conversation like that,” she says. “I felt like this waste of a person.” In private, she sobbed whenever friends announced a pregnancy. Then one friend, who was also heavy, told Balzano that she’d had a good experience at Boston I.V.F. So they made an appointment. When they arrived, a concierge greeted the couple as soon as they walked in. Balzano responded by starting to cry. The place felt too slick and fancy. She was sure she would once again be deemed unfit.</p>

<p>The doctor listened to Balzano’s story and said she understood how emotional the situation was. But she did want Balzano to lose weight. In the meantime, she was willing to prescribe letrozole, a medication used to promote ovulation, or, if that failed, a course of intrauterine insemination. I.U.I. is a low-risk procedure done without sedation in the doctor’s office; sperm is placed inside the patient’s uterus during ovulation in order to facilitate fertilization. “But it didn’t seem like she was all that interested in that,” Nick says. “The impression I got was that nobody thinks anything besides I.V.F. will work, and they wouldn’t give Gina I.V.F.” The doctor told me she recalls that she was “certainly willing to go ahead with medication and insemination,” but says she counseled Balzano to see a maternal fetal medicine specialist to discuss the potential impact of her weight on a pregnancy. Balzano declined the letrozole: “Essentially, she was saying the same thing as the first doctor — that nothing would change until I fixed my weight.”</p>

<p>Even when they do receive fertility treatment, women in larger bodies may encounter stigma in how a reproductive endocrinologist approaches their care. Stephanie Robben, 44, and the mother of twin boys in St. Louis, says her doctor didn’t mention her weight — then 247 pounds — until the first I.V.F. cycle failed. Then he outlined a daily plan for her: Drink a gallon of water, eat fewer than 900 calories and exercise for an hour. If Robben followed these directions correctly, the doctor expected her to lose 50 pounds in a month, much more than the monthly rate of four to eight pounds considered safe by major health organizations. Such extreme dieting can lead to dangerous electrolyte imbalances, dehydration — and irregular menstruation. “Rapid weight loss achieved by crash diets or excessive exercise is detrimental to reproductive outcomes during fertility treatments,” British researchers concluded in a 2010 issue of the Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences.</p>

<p>“By the end of the second day, I couldn’t even formulate a sentence,” Robben says. “All I could think about was a piece of chicken breast in my fridge.” By the end of the month, she had lost 20 pounds. The next round of I.V.F. failed as well. (Her doctor declined to comment for this article.) Robben later conceived her twins after seeing a different doctor, and without losing additional weight.</p>

<p>Meyer, of Carolina Conceptions, objects to the idea that weight stigma, not health concern, motivates clinics to require weight loss. “There are tears in these conversations,” he acknowledges. “But most of the time, I feel pretty good after sitting down with these patients. I think we almost overcompensate so we’re not judged as being biased toward weight.” When Meyer’s clinic turns away a patient based on B.M.I., it offers a referral to a local weight-loss program. He estimates that around 60 percent of those women follow through. “The patients who then come back to us [for treatment] are very thankful that they’ve made those changes,” he says. “Or their husband will say, ‘Thank you for talking to her about that.’ ”</p>

<p>Meyer admits that he doesn’t know what happens to the patients who don’t return. But those are the patients whom Rachel Ashby, at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, worries about most. “There probably is a subset of women out there who stop seeking treatment because they are aware that they may feel marginalized in the doctor’s office,” she says. “They feel this sense of ‘I can’t pursue this anymore,’ and just live quietly with infertility.’ ”</p>

<p>Balzano didn’t want to live quietly anymore. After the appointment, she says, “I reconciled myself to having weight-loss surgery pretty much that moment.” Bariatric surgery patients can lose 25 to 35 percent of their original weight, and keep it off longer than dieters do — making it the most enduring form of weight loss available. But many patients develop vitamin deficiencies because of their limited diets. And female patients are told it’s not safe to become pregnant for at least one year. The operation would cause Balzano to lose yet more time.</p>

<p>To Balzano’s doctors, this decision was a rational attempt to take control of her health and fertility. The couple see it as her required sacrifice. “We couldn’t achieve this goal because people didn’t like the way she looked,” says Nick, who was anxious about the surgery’s risks. Balzano recalls: “I was at the point where I would cut off a limb to have a baby. So fine, why not my stomach?” Balzano had her operation in December 2015. When we talked a year later, she told me how she had survived the first months consuming only liquids, and then, tiny portions of fat-free refried beans. Her B.M.I. was down to 32.1. Balzano got Ashby’s name from her bariatric surgeon and made an appointment for January 2017.</p>

<p>Balzano was now 37. However many high-quality eggs she’d had when she began trying to conceive at 30, there were thousands fewer now. “We have to get started,” Ashby told Balzano. “In fact, I would have begun treatment when you were at your highest weight.” Nick’s eyes bulged. “So we spent a ton of money and a ton of pain and we could have done this five years ago?” he asked. When we spoke the next day, Balzano was trying to remain calm about the revelation. “Look, it’s done; I’m in a good place,” she said of her surgery. “But I can understand why someone in my position might be incandescent with rage right now.”</p>

<p>Ashby told me that she would have treated Balzano at 340 pounds because she was in good health then. She doesn’t think weight was the primary cause of Balzano’s infertility, because the couple remained unable to conceive even after her surgical weight loss. “Patients often ask me, ‘If I were a normal B.M.I., would I be fertile?’ Often, that answer is no,” Ashby says. “And absent some grave risk to a patient, it’s paternalistic to say to a 35-year-old woman, ‘Go lose a hundred pounds.’ ”</p>

<p>Massachusetts health care law requires couples to try three rounds of intrauterine insemination before insurance will cover the cost of I.V.F. The first attempt failed, as everyone expected, but in November 2017, I heard from Balzano: “Just got a positive pregnancy test.” The second round of I.U.I. had worked. Logan Anthony was born on June 5, 2018, five weeks early but healthy. “I’m enjoying all the little moments daily, even the diapers,” Balzano told me, shortly after Logan turned 6 months old. “It’s still sinking in that I’m someone’s mom.”</p>

Then there's a third that might catch up, they aren't sure.  We are doing PGS (thanks to everyone who gave me their two cents on PGS!  It was a a 50/50 split and we went for PGS ultimately.)

Initially I was happy because given that this is my first round I was afraid of the unknown and I knew it was possible for me to get 0, or for the ones I got to be worse quality than they were.  We are embryo banking so I am going to do a 2nd round no matter what, but I was hoping to come out of this one with something.  I had AFC 14, AMH 1.56, 9 eggs retrieved, 7 mature, 5 fertilized. The reason we are doing IVF is severe male factor (structural issue, not sperm quality issue). So we had to do ICSI, but they told us there was nothing wrong with the amount/quality of sperm they got through PESA.  In fact we had a lot left over! (that was a nice thing to hear)

But then I looked at the Hunger Games and I was incredibly disappointed.  I honestly feel like I'm going to cry.  I feel like my clinic let me down.  People much older than me, people with lower AMH than I have, with worse initial AFC, got much better blast results (and of course, I'm quite happy for them, but I'd love to have similarly great results).  And we don't even know if these are PGS normal yet.  I'm now fully prepared to come out of this cycle with 0 embryos we can use.

Then there&#39;s a third that might catch up, they aren&#39;t sure.  We are doing PGS (thanks to everyone who gave me their two cents on PGS!  It was a a 50/50 split and we went for PGS ultimately.)</p>

<p>Initially I was happy because given that this is my first round I was afraid of the unknown and I knew it was possible for me to get 0, or for the ones I got to be worse quality than they were.  We are embryo banking so I am going to do a 2nd round no matter what, but I was hoping to come out of this one with something.  I had AFC 14, AMH 1.56, 9 eggs retrieved, 7 mature, 5 fertilized. The reason we are doing IVF is severe male factor (structural issue, not sperm quality issue). So we had to do ICSI, but they told us there was nothing wrong with the amount/quality of sperm they got through PESA.  In fact we had a lot left over! (that was a nice thing to hear)</p>

<p>But then I looked at the Hunger Games and I was incredibly disappointed.  I honestly feel like I&#39;m going to cry.  I feel like my clinic let me down.  People much older than me, people with lower AMH than I have, with worse initial AFC, got much better blast results (and of course, I&#39;m quite happy for them, but I&#39;d love to have similarly great results).  And we don&#39;t even know if these are PGS normal yet.  I&#39;m now fully prepared to come out of this cycle with 0 embryos we can use.

I'm not a big reddit user, but this is cross-posted to IVF community so apologies for any overlap. I recently visited a fertility specialist after taking a Modern Fertility at-home test and receiving ""abnormal results."" I went and got blood work done at the doctor and my levels are slightly better but still very low. I'm wondering if anyone had similar levels and what their experience has been like with the process.

I'm 32 so I (stupidly) thought I had at least a year or two until me and my husband would have to start trying. Here's the levels for what I see as the big markers (they tested like a million things but these seem the most familiar to me from the MF tests):

* Estradiol: 12.75 pg/mL
* FSH: 10.41 mIU/mL
* AMH: .169 ng/mL
* LH: 8.67 mIU/mL

I hadn't really had time to look into these results and they haven't been discussed with me. I think we are discussing them after my hysteroscopy, which is scheduled this week. I started googling around and everything is pointing to premature ovarian failure, which is devastating to me. However, I don't know why my doctor would continue with this surgery if that was the case.

I'm wondering if anyone has had similar levels, what treatment you had to undergo and ultimately if it was successful? I'm under an extreme level of stress each day and am trying to minimize that, but as I continue to try it just gets worse knowing that a future family depends on it (if that makes any sense at all).

I recently visited a fertility specialist after taking a Modern Fertility at-home test and receiving &quot;abnormal results.&quot; I went and got blood work done at the doctor and my levels are slightly better but still very low. I&#39;m wondering if anyone had similar levels and what their experience has been like with the process.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 32 so I (stupidly) thought I had at least a year or two until me and my husband would have to start trying. Here&#39;s the levels for what I see as the big markers (they tested like a million things but these seem the most familiar to me from the MF tests):</p>

<ul>
<li>Estradiol: 12.75 pg/mL</li>
<li>FSH: 10.41 mIU/mL</li>
<li>AMH: .169 ng/mL</li>
<li>LH: 8.67 mIU/mL</li>
</ul>

<p>I hadn&#39;t really had time to look into these results and they haven&#39;t been discussed with me. I think we are discussing them after my hysteroscopy, which is scheduled this week. I started googling around and everything is pointing to premature ovarian failure, which is devastating to me. However, I don&#39;t know why my doctor would continue with this surgery if that was the case.</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if anyone has had similar levels, what treatment you had to undergo and ultimately if it was successful? I&#39;m under an extreme level of stress each day and am trying to minimize that, but as I continue to try it just gets worse knowing that a future family depends on it (if that makes any sense at all).</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

Despite the infertility we likely would have struggled with (We were waiting to attempt conception for another 5-8 years.), we have no safe option to even try.

Because of my medical condition, we would have to do IVF, no matter what. There’s no other semi-safe option for a child. And there is no safe way for me to carry. If we ever want children, we will have to adopt or find a surrogate.

262,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I posted here several months ago about my story, and have been seeing an infertility therapist at the suggestion of some redditors here. It was an invaluable recommendation and I can’t thank everyone here enough. I thought I’d post an update here for anyone interested. Hugs to you all on your journey. 

My spouse and I are male factor infertile and won’t be trying any further fertility treatments. It’s a decision we’ve put off for several reasons but child free is our realistic future. My in laws never dealt well with my spouse’s DX and swept it under the rug like it never happened. My mother in law told me she didn’t feel bad for us because she didn’t know she’d pass a gene on to my husband. Fine, but you don’t need to say it while you’re driving me to an IVF appointment. When I miscarried, nobody said a word or made a call. Spouse and I spent years dealing with our pain alone. 

Fast forward to this year and my sister in law becomes pregnant. I was polite but emotionally distant during this time; I did not attend her baby shower (but sent a thoughtful gift and note) and stayed relatively away unless there was a function I couldn’t avoid. This was not well received and I was called “mean” by my sister in law. 

The baby was born a few months ago. I haven’t seen it yet because I’m not ready. For some reason, this baby is just too close to home for me. It has triggered all the issues I’ve had to deal with in my marriage related to infertility and his family’s treatment of me (my previous post history has more detail.) And I am too scared that seeing a baby that even remotely resembles my husband (his sister’s kid) will destroy me and I’ll break down sobbing. 

This also has not been well received. We’ve been attacked by two of his siblings, including the sister who had the baby. We have been called selfish, cruel, mean, horrible, you name it. We’ve been threatened that we are destroying the family. Guilted that we’ve abandoned them. I’ve been told by my brother in law (via my spouse) to grow up and get over it. He told my spouse “adopt, or do IVF until it works. Otherwise you need to fake it for our sister.” For months now. I remain “no comment” and my husband occasionally falls victim to emotional hoop jumping but for the most part we’ve held strong. 

We have also been seeing an infertility therapist who has been a lifesaver; she considers his family to be severely enmeshed, willfully ignorant of our struggle and that his sister is behaving like a brat. She is horrified at my brother in law’s comments and says he has no place at this table whatsoever. She also thinks based on some family history we disclosed, that perhaps this baby was born for a fix it reason, and our infertility issues are somehow “messing things up” for my sister in law. She insists that until they leave us alone we can’t work on our issues which prevent me from being around this baby in the first place. We have asked countless times for them to give us space and they refuse. Which leads to the subject of this post.

Spouse and I are going on a trip in ten days with his family. The planning of it was absolutely mishandled; my mother in law tried to suppress that my sister in law and her baby would be on the same plane and in the same villa as we were staying. When we found out, we politely declined to go, stating we weren’t comfortable with such intimacy yet. So my mother in law accommodated us by moving us to the front of the plane and getting spouse and I our own place. Very nice to do - I should state they are significantly wealthy at this point; things I would consider a big deal, like moving our seats and getting us a place, are like asking to pass the salt. 

So we haven’t met the baby because of our struggles, their relentless bullying and our inability to have space and time with our therapist to work on things. Every session is a discussion of the most recent attack. My mother in law (who has remained mostly neutral) suggested a brief sort of run in with my sister in law and the baby. A public place, a quick hello and goodbye. That way, we get the actual seeing of the baby out of the way quickly and we can be alone to process. I thought this seemed like a reasonable idea, because I’m a nervous flyer and the stress of seeing the baby for the first time in the terminal would not be great for me. So we agreed to set something up. 

My spouse attempted to schedule this meeting with his sister. We were feeling positive about taking a step for us, getting the scary part over of seeing this kid and being able to enjoy the trip. But my sister in law refused unless I have a conversation with her, where she can tell me how everything I’ve done, or didn’t do, has hurt her, and she expects me to tell her how I have been hurting. 

This conversation is never going to happen. Firstly, because she was balls out hostile and attacking towards me, and my spouse told her I’m not interested in ANY conversation without an apology. She has refused, saying she doesn’t need to apologize “for you guys hurting me.” She also doesn’t understand that she has no seat at this table and continues to make this about herself. She’s been told in clear terms this is private and we will not be discussing it with anyone. And yet she continues to harp that she “needs to hear an explanation” for why I didn’t go to her shower, and that she really needs to tell me how she feels. Oh, but she “won’t do it in a way that makes me feel bad or anything.” 😐 So she gets all the freedom to act and say as she pleases, but I do not. 

So my spouse told her our terms for meeting the kid were non negotiable; quick, light and casual. She refused and then said I’m not allowed around “her baby” until I agree to speak with her. However, because my spouse “made an effort to make her feel better” he is fully permitted to see the kid. Spouse told her the only way we see the kid is according to the terms we set. She hung up. 

Friends, I’m weary. First I was a liability for not seeing the kid and now I’m a liability if I do. This family (mostly siblings, spouse’s parents have been silent and on good terms) has been so terrible since this all started and I’ve reached a place where I no longer care for them in my life. My spouse is breaking down because he feels torn; it’s become something so much bigger now with their behavior and he’s facing “hard truths” about his family. At one point, we considered just him going to see the kid, but he is against this now because his family is clearly looking to divide us and vilify me.

It was an invaluable recommendation and I can’t thank everyone here enough. I thought I’d post an update here for anyone interested. Hugs to you all on your journey. </p>

<p>My spouse and I are male factor infertile and won’t be trying any further fertility treatments. It’s a decision we’ve put off for several reasons but child free is our realistic future. My in laws never dealt well with my spouse’s DX and swept it under the rug like it never happened. My mother in law told me she didn’t feel bad for us because she didn’t know she’d pass a gene on to my husband. Fine, but you don’t need to say it while you’re driving me to an IVF appointment. When I miscarried, nobody said a word or made a call. Spouse and I spent years dealing with our pain alone. </p>

<p>Fast forward to this year and my sister in law becomes pregnant. I was polite but emotionally distant during this time; I did not attend her baby shower (but sent a thoughtful gift and note) and stayed relatively away unless there was a function I couldn’t avoid. This was not well received and I was called “mean” by my sister in law. </p>

<p>The baby was born a few months ago. I haven’t seen it yet because I’m not ready. For some reason, this baby is just too close to home for me. It has triggered all the issues I’ve had to deal with in my marriage related to infertility and his family’s treatment of me (my previous post history has more detail.) And I am too scared that seeing a baby that even remotely resembles my husband (his sister’s kid) will destroy me and I’ll break down sobbing. </p>

<p>This also has not been well received. We’ve been attacked by two of his siblings, including the sister who had the baby. We have been called selfish, cruel, mean, horrible, you name it. We’ve been threatened that we are destroying the family. Guilted that we’ve abandoned them. I’ve been told by my brother in law (via my spouse) to grow up and get over it. He told my spouse “adopt, or do IVF until it works. Otherwise you need to fake it for our sister.” For months now. I remain “no comment” and my husband occasionally falls victim to emotional hoop jumping but for the most part we’ve held strong. </p>

<p>We have also been seeing an infertility therapist who has been a lifesaver; she considers his family to be severely enmeshed, willfully ignorant of our struggle and that his sister is behaving like a brat. She is horrified at my brother in law’s comments and says he has no place at this table whatsoever. She also thinks based on some family history we disclosed, that perhaps this baby was born for a fix it reason, and our infertility issues are somehow “messing things up” for my sister in law. She insists that until they leave us alone we can’t work on our issues which prevent me from being around this baby in the first place. We have asked countless times for them to give us space and they refuse. Which leads to the subject of this post.</p>

And then 6dpo I had very mild period like cramps, over night I got really bad nausea, heartburn and shortness of breath (shortness of breath was my first sign of my last pregnancy) and I even threw up!! I very very rarely throw up. I’ve also had cold like symptoms for about 2 days. I know I shouldn’t be symptom spotting, but do you think it’s impossible to get those kind of symptoms at 8dpo? 

I would take a test, but I’m taking pregnyl which contains HCG so would give a false positive! 

Would love any thoughts :)

293,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I’ve been posting a lot about my strangely high FSH levels for my age. If you haven’t been following me, I’m 23 and have an FSH of 10 despite a ‘good’ AMH and ‘good’ AFC.
I also have PCOS. Male factor infertility has lead us to seek out IVF.

My family doctor offered to do me some routine hormonal blood tests for our private referral to the fertility clinic we are now at. This is where I found out I have a high FSH. 

Now my theory. 
I’ve not ovulated since January of this year. With my PCOS my body tends to always be trying to ovulate. I will have one good month where I do ovulate and then inevitably get a proper period as my husband doesn’t manage to get me pregnant. I will then go on a long string of months where my ovaries constantly try to release an egg but fail to do so. My OPKs will remain positive (or near enough positive) and I’ll even get ovulation pain and cervical mucus that looks as though it’s about to change to Egg whites, but it never makes that transition. So my body gets stuck in a loop of constantly trying to pump an egg out.

Some months I get breakthrough bleeding. This is when my family doctor took my FSH and other hormone levels, on day 3 of a ‘bleed’ but not a proper period. I had just started a new diet, 1 week prior to this (keto) and it brought on a bleed that my doctor wanted to use to get CD3 results. It wasn’t a proper period at all. 
And the strangest thing about this break through bleeding is my body still attempts to ovulate even when I’m bleeding!! I’ve been known to ovulate on CD6 because I was never having a proper period in the first place. If my CD3 bloods had been taken on that cycle, they’d have definitely showed elevated FSH and LH because my body was bleeding yes, however it was also preparing to ovulate ASAP. 

My theory is that this is why my FSH May be as high. I don’t personally believe I’m low on ovarian reserve. I know FSH tends to be higher during certain stages of your menstrual cycle and at its lowest during your period. But how does this work for a woman who does not get proper periods? My hormones are never in line anymore. The only time they briefly fall into line is when I’ve managed to ovulate. 

I’m posting this here as I’m wondering what you guys think about my theory? I’ve been very worried about my FSH, as you all know, for a few days now. I called my clinic today and asked them about it and they said they usually don’t even test FSH anymore as it’s ‘highly unreliable’ and they tend to go off of AMH and AFC. The only thing they wanted me to bring in to my consultation next week was proof of my rubella immunity and STD tests - all come back clear of course.

If you haven’t been following me, I’m 23 and have an FSH of 10 despite a ‘good’ AMH and ‘good’ AFC.
I also have PCOS. Male factor infertility has lead us to seek out IVF.</p>

<p>My family doctor offered to do me some routine hormonal blood tests for our private referral to the fertility clinic we are now at. This is where I found out I have a high FSH. </p>

<p>Now my theory. 
I’ve not ovulated since January of this year. With my PCOS my body tends to always be trying to ovulate. I will have one good month where I do ovulate and then inevitably get a proper period as my husband doesn’t manage to get me pregnant. I will then go on a long string of months where my ovaries constantly try to release an egg but fail to do so. My OPKs will remain positive (or near enough positive) and I’ll even get ovulation pain and cervical mucus that looks as though it’s about to change to Egg whites, but it never makes that transition. So my body gets stuck in a loop of constantly trying to pump an egg out.</p>

<p>Some months I get breakthrough bleeding. This is when my family doctor took my FSH and other hormone levels, on day 3 of a ‘bleed’ but not a proper period. I had just started a new diet, 1 week prior to this (keto) and it brought on a bleed that my doctor wanted to use to get CD3 results. It wasn’t a proper period at all. 
And the strangest thing about this break through bleeding is my body still attempts to ovulate even when I’m bleeding!! I’ve been known to ovulate on CD6 because I was never having a proper period in the first place. If my CD3 bloods had been taken on that cycle, they’d have definitely showed elevated FSH and LH because my body was bleeding yes, however it was also preparing to ovulate ASAP. </p>

<p>My theory is that this is why my FSH May be as high. I don’t personally believe I’m low on ovarian reserve. I know FSH tends to be higher during certain stages of your menstrual cycle and at its lowest during your period. But how does this work for a woman who does not get proper periods? My hormones are never in line anymore. The only time they briefly fall into line is when I’ve managed to ovulate. </p>

<p>I’m posting this here as I’m wondering what you guys think about my theory? I’ve been very worried about my FSH, as you all know, for a few days now. I called my clinic today and asked them about it and they said they usually don’t even test FSH anymore as it’s ‘highly unreliable’ and they tend to go off of AMH and AFC. The only thing they wanted me to bring in to my consultation next week was proof of my rubella immunity and STD tests - all come back clear of course. They told me I can take along my FSH results but they don’t often test for FSH themselves and apparently most clinics don’t rely on it anymore.
Has anyone else heard of clinics doing this rather than the traditional FSH/LH? </p>

First FET didn’t implant, second stopped growing at 6 weeks. I also had a miscarriage after getting pregnant off Clomid about 2.5 years ago, so I’m now getting an RPL panel and being sent to a MFM for a consult. Until now we’ve been unexplained, although with slightly crappy eggs for me and slightly low morphology numbers for Mr. Pumpkin. We now have one PGS normal embryo remaining.

A bit more background: I have a few autoimmune issues: rheumatoid arthritis, a shellfish allergy (with anaphylactic reaction), and recently started getting exercise-induced hives. My RA is well-controlled with Humira, which I’ve stayed on through this most recent pregnancy at the advice of my rheumatologist.

Now for the odd part. About two weeks after my first miscarriage, a routine physical found elevated eosinophils in my blood (>2,000cells/uL). Apparently this can be caused by a reaction to a medicine, a parasite, or several other things. I was sent to my allergist (they had no idea), and also a hematologist, who eventually did a bone marrow biopsy to rule out leukemia (negative, thank goodness). This eventually resolved itself after a few months. It was never clear to me whether this was due to the pregnancy, the miscarriage, or the misoprostol/Cytotec that I took (or something else entirely, suspiciously timed around the pregnancy).

I’ve kept an eye on my blood work results since then, but have had no abnormalities…until I got finally pregnant again this past month. I insisted on them drawing CBCs every time they were poking around in my veins:) This time around, at 5 weeks I had a CBC that found white blood cells (14.3k), neutrophils (8280), lymphocytes (4447), and monocytes (1044) all slightly elevated, but I'm told this isn't uncommon during pregnancy. Eosinophils were 472, just within ‘normal’. I also had a CBC drawn at 7 weeks (when the lack of growth was confirmed and supporting progesterone and estrogen withdrawn, but BEFORE I took Cytotec) with some significantly higher values: white blood cells (16.0k), neutrophils (9536), lymphocytes (4704), monocytes (1024), and also eosinophils (656). All other values are in normal range. I do not have any other signs of an infection, and my RE is confident I don't have one.

I had always been suspicious that the elevated eosinophils 2 years ago were caused by the pregnancy, but now I’m relatively certain of this. I’m a scientist (non-medical), and I’ve done quite a bit of research into this but haven’t been able to find any studies or even occurrences of this problem. I have wondered if my body recognizes the pregnancy as a 'parasite' or other foreign body, and my immune system doesn't switch off like it ought to? I’ve been wondering if I may be a good candidate for seeing a reproductive immunologist (my RE doesn’t subscribe, but is willing to let me look into it on my own)? I’ve also wondered whether this type of abnormal blood reaction actually makes it dangerous for me to get pregnant (long-term elevated eosinophils can cause organ damage)?

My frustration is growing, and I almost feel like I don’t want to continue on with this clinic, but I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or being shortsighted here.

I was seeing a local-to-me clinic that I liked, but they don’t offer IVF and so encouraged me to get set up at a larger clinic a few hours away. I found a clinic where the RE had good reviews, and I liked her when I met her for an IVF consult. However, my insurance denied my IVF coverage—this was in early May. On May 10, I spoke with a nurse about starting IUI instead, and she said they would get the pre-authorization paperwork started that day. When I hadn’t heard back about 3 weeks later, I called my insurance, and they said they hadn’t received any paperwork for IUI. So I contacted the clinic—no response. 5 days later I contacted them again—no response. Yesterday I called and talked to someone who said the insurance requested more information, and they were working on it. 

Today, amazingly, I get a letter in the mail from my insurance stating that my request to *convert from an IUI cycle to IVF* had been denied. I’m not even undergoing any treatment cycle right now because I’ve been waiting for this godforsaken authorization to be decided! So obviously they never sent in the paperwork in May, and then when I contacted them the second time (based on the date of the letter), they sent the wrong paperwork.

I’m seriously considering going back to my local clinic for the time being and then seeking a different larger clinic. However, I’m not that familiar with what the service is like at larger clinics—are my expectations too high? Seriously appreciate any advice of what you would do in this situation.
