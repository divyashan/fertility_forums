I have my appointment with SG on Tuesday, but I was just looking at the website about the shared risk program.

I see I just barely meet 40 years old requirement, question one....would the guarentee only be good till the end of my 40th year (meaning once I turn 40 the money back guarentee is void).

Additionally, I see the FET shared risk program requires that the users eggs must be frozen before they turn 39.....I turn 39 in January.  This is what scares me the most, is there time?  I see so many ladies doing FET I'm not sure what it means if I can only do fresh transfers.  

My gyno called to tell me that my AMH is lower than they like so I know its under 1, by how much I'm waiting till Tuesday to find out.  I know my FSH is fairly  good, which may indicate that what I do have left might be of OK quality, regardless I just went into a bit of a panic seeing that unless I can get some good eggs retrived in the next 4 months I would only have fresh transfers availalbe to me or donor (which I don't think I can come up with the money for that on top of the shared risk fees).

Additionally, I've been researching the heck out of improving quality as quickly as possible and from my research HGH has been showing incrediable results.  I have access to verified quality HGH, and want to ask the RE if I can start that right away.  I see high doeses are used during cycles, but I see that lower amounts for an extended period of time 6, 8, or 10 weeks may produce the greatest results in quality of the eggs.  

Sorry if this is all over the place, nothing like being told despite your age you appear to be in great health....but then find out oops I was wrong your time is indeed almost over.

25,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I’ve been thinking about posting this for a while, but I’m not sure if this is the appropriate place for it. I also don’t like stepping on others’ toes because people get caught up in numbers. Infertility can breed such anger and resentment sometimes. 

Background: Trying for 2-2.5 years and nothing has likely happened other than indents. I give a range of time because we had some confusion on whether or not we were actually trying in the early stages. 

I went through two monitored cycles last fall and I was told my infertility was unexplained. The doctor told us that IUI would be best, or timed intercourse with Femara as an alternative. We had a bit of shell shock and took some time off in December and January. We also assumed that we could probably just give it more time before doing anything else. I started looking for natural alternatives and lifestyle changes (spring 2018) and felt equally let down by their lack of success. 

I’m waiting to switch my shifts from full-day to part-day once September comes. Then I won’t have to battle with work for time off for more monitoring and appointments. Our goal is to do an IUI then, despite the low success rate.

<p>Background: Trying for 2-2.5 years and nothing has likely happened other than indents. I give a range of time because we had some confusion on whether or not we were actually trying in the early stages. </p>

<p>I went through two monitored cycles last fall and I was told my infertility was unexplained. The doctor told us that IUI would be best, or timed intercourse with Femara as an alternative. We had a bit of shell shock and took some time off in December and January. We also assumed that we could probably just give it more time before doing anything else. I started looking for natural alternatives and lifestyle changes (spring 2018) and felt equally let down by their lack of success. </p>

<p>I’m waiting to switch my shifts from full-day to part-day once September comes. Then I won’t have to battle with work for time off for more monitoring and appointments. Our goal is to do an IUI then, despite the low success rate. </p>

I knew going in it probably wouldn't work but a small part of me hoped. Because we had used IVF stim meds and I had 3-4 follicles for this IUI. So just maybe one of those would be viable. I hate hope more than anything. 

But anywho, that's not the point of this post. My RE has so far, over the last 1.5 years been very encouraging about my chances of getting pregnant using ART. My numbers look ok and there is nothing wrong with my uterus except that one polyp that was removed a very long time ago. Aside from that there is nothing to indicate a problem. Since we're a lesbian couple we did not come to her initially because we had fertility problems, but more because we had a partner-lacks-sperm problem. I think she continues to see this as our only barrier to conception despite never conceiving. Ever. 

To date, we have done 2 IVF cycles with one fresh transfer, 2 IUI's, and 4 home inseminations. I had poor quality embryos the first IVF round (transfer and froze the remaining at 3 days) and the second I didn't even make it to retrieval because I didn't respond to the meds and only had 4 follicles growing. We've also used two different donors. One was a known donor with fresh sperm. His sperm analysis was excellent so no issues there. Frozen donor has been meh on the count when thawed but he has confirmed pregnancies. The problem seems to be on my end.

I want to have a very long and detailed WTF appointment about my options here. There is either a problem with my eggs or there is a problem that is preventing implantation. Maybe both. It's starting to really irk me that my RE has absolutely nothing at all to say about it. If I have a diagnosis or even a suspected one I want her to tell me what she is thinking. And it's confusing to not have my concerns validated at all even though there clearly is reason for concern.

My AFC was 18, and so my RE said we could hope for 15 eggs at retrieval.  Well we only have 9 follicles, 4 above 10 and 5 between 4-7.  My regular RE is out on vacation and the other one said he wouldn't expect any more to grow, and that I might hope for 5 mature eggs.  I know hoping to get away with only one retrieval is a little foolish, but we are out of pocket and will need to figure out if we can/want to go into debt for a second retrieval.  We get one restart if we cancel.  I have had two pretty different AMH draws--one at .98 and one over 3.  The RE said this response may indicate the .98 one is more accurate, or it could just be an off month.  I'm leaning towards cancelling I guess but waiting to talk to the doctor this afternoon when my blood test results come in.  My regular RE will be back from vacation on Monday.  Would love any suggestions, thanks.

Moving foward, I'm back to compiling out of pocket price quotes. I thought it would be helpful to add a list of prices to our wiki if the mods are up for it. Please add your own price info below.

Estimates of WIN Fertility prices are especially helpful, since their pricing can be excellent, but they offer bundled quotes only. E.g., a total quote for medications A, B, and C, but not for any of them individually. Verbal quotes are offered only once every six months. Once prescriptions are actually sent to the pharmacy, they will let you have additional quotes if you swap meds in AND out of the quote - this is to prevent you from finding the price of a single medication. However, you can basically turn it into an algebra problem where the price for X number of medications can be solved if you have the price for a few different combinations of those meds. Obviously, this is labor intensive. We can get around it if individual members here are willing to call for quotes. If you're interested, let me know and I'll message you with a list of meds to get a quote for.  


FSH - gonal F or follistim are interchangeable

\- WINFertility: $253 per 300 of follistim (this is approximate, based on their bundled pricing)

\- MDR Pharmacy - $291 for 300u of follistim

\- Freedom Fertility - $327 for 300u of gonal F. My price with insurance was $423!  (additional 10% discount available for out of pocket purchases through the Go Direct program, for a final price of $294)

\- Mendell's Pharmacy - $340 for 300u (I forget if this is gonal F or folistim).

I get why the shots need to be the same time every night. My RE was absolutely insistent on starting my first shot at 9 pm on the dot. I was then told I can adjust to 8-830 on the following nights thereafter, just make sure I pick a time and stick with it. So tonight we chose 8:20. 
 
Why does the first shot have to be a specific time? Is the timing of the shots after the first one more ""maintenance"", just as long as you don't exceed the 24 hour mark in between them? I am of course freaking myself out that I should have just done the shot @ 9 PM, even though they said it was fine to adjust it a little earlier.
 
My ERA is scheduled for Monday morning at 11:15 AM, so that night would be day 6 PIO. So the ERA itself is like 5.5 days of PIO.

38,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello,

My sonohysterogram was by far the most painful part of my first IVF cycle right now. It took two nurses several tries to get the catheter in. The nurse said something about my cervix ""took a sharp turn"" or something. It was so painful, I was lightheaded afterwards. And it only lasted a minute.

My frozen transfer is coming up next week and I am really worried. Isn't it \*kinda\* similar to the sonohysterogram--in that they thread a catheter through your cervix? I am so worried about the pain and they will only give me a valium. I also heard that if you are tense it can affect the transfer negatively??

My doc doesn't do a mock transfer. In fact, I've only ever talked to my doc three times in this process--I always deal with nurses. Is that normal? (My friend is also going thru IVF at a different place and she said she \*always\* sees the doctor). Should I demand to ask the Dr about the pain and if anything else can/should be done?

Thanks for any help.

40,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My RE proposed some things I’d never heard about before, and I wanted to share them in case anyone finds them helpful and/or interesting.

I’m DOR (AFC \~5, AMH 1.06), a poor responder, and my 40 y.o. husband has shit morphology (0.5% Krueger in Jan 2016). I might have endo, but I have no other known issues and a perfectly normal uterus. An ERA showed I need one more day of progesterone prior to FET. I transferred two embryos that resulted in triplets, but they didn't grow well, and I had a D&C at 9 weeks.

**Treatment history:**

* Two IUIs with Clomid: both resulted in very thin lining (< 5mm). One CP.
* IVF cycle 1: e-primed antagonist, AFC 5, three eggs retrieved, one fertilized and made it to a “fair” blast. Kitchen sink FET failed.
* Cycle 2: e-primed microdose Lupron, AFC 11 (I credit acupuncture for this), 11 eggs retrieved, six mature, four fertilized, two made it to top-graded blasts. Kitchen sink FET of both embryos and high betas early on.

**Cycle 3 (my final one):**

* We can begin a stim cycle as soon as my next period, which would be the first after my D&C (e-priming would begin on day 21 of that cycle). This was surprising, as another RE at my clinic said he likes to wait 2-3 months after MC. He may have been referring to fresh transfers, which I've never had.
* Protocol: same microdose Lupron flare/Gonal/Menopur protocol with the addition of HGH during stims, which would help support my eggs somehow. I'm not looking forward to the med costs, which was through the roof last time thanks to max stims.
* FET changes include the addition of Lupron to suppress suspected endometrial growth as well as Plaquenil. This drug is used for autoimmune diseases (which I don’t have). We are pending the genetic results from my D&C, and normal embryo results would indicate that something might be wrong with my body, which would further encourage her to use Plaquenil. *She nixed the Lupron, as it can change my receptivity, which we've already confirmed via ERA. Since I had implantation last time, she doesn't want to add any variables. She also decided against the Plaquenil due to my negative RPL results and the chromosomal abnormalities of the miscarried embryos. If either one had opposite results (i.e., I tested positive for autoimmune issues or the embryo\[s\] had been normal), she would have used the Plaquenil.*
* I asked about intralipid infusions, and she said the research is inconclusive and that it’s not done in their practice.
* *She said there is nothing she can do to help the follicles/eggs grow evenly. However, she can stim me a day longer to give the smaller ones a chance to catch up. This will potentially ""overcook"" the larger ones but may yield more of the others. She will also have me use two Ovidrel triggers rather than just one.*

**Additional testing:**

* Pending genetic test results from D&C. The nurse had told me that these results are usually very general, i.e. “normal vs. abnormal.” However, my RE said she called the lab and asked them to evaluate the chromosomes as closely as possible. She thinks they’ll be able to give us more info, since she provided plenty of tissue (sad face), although triplet pregnancies can make analysis a bit more difficult.
* RPL panel, since I’ve had two losses during treatment as well as a miscarriage in my early 20s. This would include karyotyping and blood clotting issues (I've used Lovenox and baby aspirin for both FETs, anyway). The RPL requires a prior auth from my insurance, so it wasn’t drawn today. ~~I don't know if I'll do the karyotype without insurance coverage. I'll have to research it some more.~~ I called our insurance company, and our plan covers karyotype testing at 100%, which was shocking.
* Hysteroscopy to rule out scarring from the D&C, *retained tissue,* and any new structural issues. This would take place prior to my FET.
* I asked about my suspected endo, and she offered to do a lap and ablation. This would take place during my hysteroscopy.
* Updated AMH, as well as TSH, hemoglobin a1c, and vitamin D (all except AMH have been normal in the past).
* Karyotype for husband. She said that poor morphology can sometimes correlate with genetic issues. ~~I doubt our insurance will cover it, so I’m going to wait to see if mine is covered before having him do this. If my results have red flags, then I’ll have him tested. If not, what’s the point? (please tell me if I’m missing it)~~
* PGS for embryos. This will cost $4-5 k, based on last year’s fee schedule. Their lab doesn’t discard abnormals, and she can ask the level of mosaicism to determine if we want to give them a shot. We’ll opt out if I only get 1-2 embryos again.

**Supplements/Diet/Exercise**

* 300mg CoQ10, vitamin D (pending lab results), 150mg DHEA, and prenatal. She recommended vitamin E prior to the FET (I used it last time). New to me was 1000mg L-arginine 2x/day. She said it can sometimes be helpful for patients who’ve had unsuccessful FETs.
* CoQ10 for my husband. I forgot to ask about the dose, but he’s been taking 200mg/day.
* Try to avoid any foods I’m allergic to (not applicable)
* Exercise as usual. She’ll advise me of changes as we approach FET.

I reiterated that this is my last cycle, and she said we can consider trying to conceive on our own between the retrieval and the FET. If we are successful, we can decide to use the frozen embryo(s) to try and have more children. That is such a fucking pipe dream, but I’m leaning toward this, as we’ll be traveling a bit in October. My last vacation was in the TWW, and I'd rather not do that again.

<li>Exercise as usual. She’ll advise me of changes as we approach FET.</li>
</ul>

<p>I reiterated that this is my last cycle, and she said we can consider trying to conceive on our own between the retrieval and the FET. If we are successful, we can decide to use the frozen embryo(s) to try and have more children. That is such a fucking pipe dream, but I’m leaning toward this, as we’ll be traveling a bit in October. My last vacation was in the TWW, and I&#39;d rather not do that again.</p>

<p>Any thoughts, suggestions, anecdotes, experiences, etc. are welcome! I hope this long post helps someone.</p>

I’m also worried that my murderous rage episodes are further impacting my ability to conceive. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you deal?</p>

My wife is 35 years old.  We do not have any children.

Since she was 16 or so, she had extremely heavy or irregular menstruation.  To help with this she was prescribed birth control.  She had been on it up until about 3-4 years ago.

Around then, we decided to have a baby or at least try.  Nothing was happening, but we suddenly noticed a change in her health.  She began to develop acne on her upper shoulder/arm area, and some hair to her chin.  Her periods were about once every three or four months and even then they were very painful and turbulent. Her hair on her head seemed a little thin and brittle and she began to gain weight.  Going from around a size 8 to a size 14.

She saw an OBGYN who told her that she was producing too much testosterone and gave her a pill to balance it out.  She started on it and had a regular period for a few months, but was told she might have something called PCOS.

With this information she went to a fertility specialist who diagnosed her physically on the spot, by her showing all the signs.  But it was unknown to what exact degree her PCOS was.  The doctor recommended some sort of minor surgery to go in and take a look to see the severity.   We did not have the surgery for financial reasons.

Yesterday she went to the OBGYN for the first time in these past three years at my own insistence.  The doctor again told her that she had PCOS.  My wife then asked her about fertility and chances.

Femara is the medication my wife is being put on along with spiroactalone for the chin hair/acne.   The doctor said this was to increase ovulation happening.

At 35 years old, can this work?  I mean, from what I've read, the Femara just makes you ovulate and doesn't guarantee pregnancy.  I realistically don't know what our chances are because she's possibly had this PCOS since she was 16.  Would years of that effect things?  Her age?  Even if fertilization occurs, wouldn't miscarriage in the first trimester be very high?

My husband and I have our first consultation next Tuesday at Shady Grove. My gynecologist has run my day 3 blood work, hsg, and my husbands SA. I also had my AMH blood drawn this week (waiting for those results).

We’ve not been preventing for 1.5 years and tracking and trying since January. I’m 38 and he is 41.  My gynecologist thinks our numbers look good, his SA was called excellent so I’m anticipating getting labeled with unexplained infertility, unless they see something in my cycle and numbers my doc didn’t catch (which I know is possible).  Other wise I’m fairly normal all around as far as cycle goes.

Before going into my appointment I’d like to educate myself on all things IUI as I’m assuming that may be our first steps. The main page has wonderful questions for the doctor I’ve been reviewing but I’d love to understand the different options and potential protocols for IUI so I can feel somewhat knowledgeable when sitting down with them.

Could anyone point me to some great resources or post on this to start reading?

In 2016 I started out at a freestanding fertility clinic recommended by my GYN. They did the workup, had me order the IVF meds, and then they scuttled the procedure because at my CD 2 exam my FSH was 18. I was devastated. And pissed, because I'd paid stiff copays for the meds and they basically washed their hands of me. They said the problem couldn't be fixed and my chances of conceiving were very low. Were they being honest and not offering false hope, or were they just protecting their success rate? Who knows?

I had my GYN appointment a few months after, asked the doctor his opinion. He plainly didn't like what he heard and told me to try elsewhere. I sought a second opinion at a prominent university-affiliated clinic in the city. Some other things ensued, I did two other workups, both  last year and the year before- I was still at 18. Okay. Current doc said they had protocols to respond to high FSH. And my insurance coverage's FSH cutoff was 19.

Last month's FSH was at 10.6- a hair above the clinic's cutoff for using Cetrotide right before my cycle to address FSH. So he scuttled IVF plans for last month and put me on the Cetrotide shots. My CD 2 exam was yesterday, and FSH is now 6.8.

This spring I started off with 3 cycles of IUI (clomid and ovidrel). That's main change since my initial workups. Last month (10.6 FSH) was without any meds, since we were planning to start IVF.

I've gone from FSH 18 in 2016 and 2017, down to 10.6 last month, and now something more do-able with the meds (yay!). But I don't get how I went from 18 to 10.6. What experience does the Reddit hive-mind have with this?

I called in and they told me to continue with the progesterone and just wait and take a HPT on day 14 after IUI just like previously instructed. I tested yesterday (day 14 post-iui) and it was negative. Called my RE and they said to call back on day 1 of full flow to schedule IUI #3. Our next step after this cycle will be to move to IVF. </p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced such a random short cycle while doing medicated cycles? Is this normal? It kind of freaked me out.</p>

This is a topic most people love to talk about since it always sparks an interesting discussion. I was wondering how anyone else's relationship with their list has changed through this process?

Over the years I added names and removed them periodically. I've had this list saved in Google docs since I started my first real job. I modified it when I got married and got rid of ideas that didn't fit my new last name. I added names my husband mentioned. Though a few months ago in a fit of despair, I deleted it. It wasn't a happy thing for me anymore. The list seemed like such a pipe dream. At that moment it represented a list of names of people I'd never meet. I used to picture the kids that would have these names, a serious brown haired girl and an ornery little boy. I tried to get rid of them but their still in my head and I still want to meet them. Names just make it real. Sometimes they gives me hope, sometimes they make me doubtful and sad. 

Upon starting to see the RE my husband has been more excited about sharing names and I've started to share fewer. He's excited that trying is becoming more real and I am trying not to get my hopes up. I know I have become myopic and think less about the result: life with a baby and children; and stay more focused on the process of trying. I have noticed we've both become kinder about each other's suggestions. Before we would have immediately and insensitively shot ones down that we didn't like with an ""ew"" or a story about some slut from HS that had that name. Now we're a lot nicer about it. I haven't actually shared my absolute favorites with my husband, not sure why. I guess I'm a little worried that he will have a story that will ruin a favorite for me and I'll end up in that despairing place again.

I like reading other people's name choices. It's just such a personal thing and a window into their mind. If it makes you happy please share yours and what lead you to where you are.

The downvote option is kept on for a number of reasons (as below). However, our regular readers need to actively participate in the voting system for it function.  

1) Even if downvotes are turned off, users who access the sub via mobile or Reddit Enhancement Suite will still have the option to downvote. We want all users to be on an equal playing field. 

2) There are other ways to downvote a comment or thread. If someone wants to downvote you badly enough, they will. 

3) Voting serves a function. A downvote says ""You are giving bad advice"" or ""this comment is inappropriate for our sub."" (Reminder that if a post breaks our rules, hit the report button to let the mods know!) A downvote is NOT supposed to be used in the case of disagreement. An upvote says ""this is good advice,"" ""I'm entertained by what you said,"" ""this is good information that I've never heard before,"" etc.

/r/infertility currently has 9,200+ subscribers. When I made a similar post 7 months ago, we had 7,000+ subscribers.  We have 2,700+ unique viewers to our sub every day with over 18,000 page views per day. Our contributors (and lurkers) are what make this sub so great. Participation, even in the form of voting, improves the quality of the sub. When looking at comment replies to a thread, generally speaking the user with the best advice has the most upvotes. 

**Moral of the story is UPVOTE to provide support to those who take the time to share their knowledge and those who ask great questions.**

On another note in regard to posts by new users - we were all newbies at one point. If you feel like a question is ""too basic"" for our sub, feel free to (politely) point them in the right direction to one of our sister subs or frankly, just answer the question. If you don't have the emotional energy to deal with a new poster, move on but please don't downvote. We do not want to scare off new contributors because their posts are downvoted into oblivion.

118,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello. I have found this community while browsing online looking for advice. I'll try to make it as short as I can.

Both my husband and I are 33 years old. We have been married for 10 years. We are each other's first. He has been a wonderful husband in every sense of the word.

We have been trying to conceive a child for a few years, but with no luck. At first we thought that maybe I was the problem, but that turned out not to be the case. My husband then got checked out, and it turned that he was infertile. He went to various doctors and specialists to see if there was any way around this. There was not.

As you can imagine, we were both crushed. My husband especially took it really hard. He was an only child, and to top it off his parents have been on his case to start a family. 

After some time, his parents suggested that we should look into adoption. However, my husband quickly dismissed the idea because he did not want to raise ""another man's child."" So then I brought up the idea of perhaps getting a sperm donor. My reasoning was that even if the child might not be biologically his, he/she would be mine and that would be enough. My husband was not to keen on having another man's sperm inside of me. Like I mentioned earlier, we were each other's first. So at that point, I resigned myself that we were destined to be childless. It's not what I wanted, but those were our circumstances.

Anyways, after a few months, we were eating dinner one evening when my husband suddenly handed me an adoption pamphlet. He told me that he has been thinking long and hard and he thinks that we should adopt. I was ecstatic that he changed his mind. However, I told him that I really wanted to experience what it's like to be pregnant and raise a child from the beginning. He lashed out at me and told me that it was really hard for him to get to this point and that I was complicating things. When I say lash out, i don't mean that he was yelling or anything like that, I don't want people to get the wrong idea. He did raise voice though, something that he's never done before. He did not like the idea of me being pregnant with another man's child. Again, we reached an impasse.

Flash forward to last week when we were watching tv when suddenly my husband turned off the tv. He held my hands together and told me that he loves me, that he's very sorry that he's infertile, and that he wants to start a family. There were tears in his eyes, which in turn made me cry as well.

He told me that he will allow a sperm donation if we all allow an egg donor as well. I was surprised and confused. He explained to me that he said that he felt like there would always be this cloud over his head that the child that he is raising is related to me, but not himself. He said if we did a double donation, then child would not be related to either one of us and we would be on ""equal terms"". He said he would prefer to adopt, but that he is willing to meet me halfway because he knows that I want to be pregnant. I told him that I would think about it. And that 's where I find myself today. 

This procedure will cost us a lot more, but honestly that's not really a problem. Neither of us have a high paying job or anything, but we have both been financially responsible throughout our marriage. Money isn't an issue.

Also, before anyone says that my husband is being petty or unreasonable, he himself said that might be the case. However, that's how he feels. Whether it's right or wrong, I can't change the way he feels. He's come a long way to get this far. He said he's changed his mind about a couple of things, but if I want to go the donor route, he will not change about a double donation.

I don't know what to do. I didn't even know that a double donation was a feasible option. I guess it never crossed my mind. I really want to be pregnant, but I guess that I also really wanted to have a child that looked like me and that was related to me. So in that sense, giving that up, I know understand what my husband was going through and still is.

I have found this community while browsing online looking for advice. I&#39;ll try to make it as short as I can.</p>

<p>Both my husband and I are 33 years old. We have been married for 10 years. We are each other&#39;s first. He has been a wonderful husband in every sense of the word.</p>

<p>We have been trying to conceive a child for a few years, but with no luck. At first we thought that maybe I was the problem, but that turned out not to be the case. My husband then got checked out, and it turned that he was infertile. He went to various doctors and specialists to see if there was any way around this. There was not.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, we were both crushed. My husband especially took it really hard. He was an only child, and to top it off his parents have been on his case to start a family. </p>

<p>After some time, his parents suggested that we should look into adoption. However, my husband quickly dismissed the idea because he did not want to raise &quot;another man&#39;s child.&quot; So then I brought up the idea of perhaps getting a sperm donor. My reasoning was that even if the child might not be biologically his, he/she would be mine and that would be enough. My husband was not to keen on having another man&#39;s sperm inside of me. Like I mentioned earlier, we were each other&#39;s first. So at that point, I resigned myself that we were destined to be childless. It&#39;s not what I wanted, but those were our circumstances.</p>

<p>Anyways, after a few months, we were eating dinner one evening when my husband suddenly handed me an adoption pamphlet. He told me that he has been thinking long and hard and he thinks that we should adopt. I was ecstatic that he changed his mind. However, I told him that I really wanted to experience what it&#39;s like to be pregnant and raise a child from the beginning. He lashed out at me and told me that it was really hard for him to get to this point and that I was complicating things. When I say lash out, i don&#39;t mean that he was yelling or anything like that, I don&#39;t want people to get the wrong idea. He did raise voice though, something that he&#39;s never done before. He did not like the idea of me being pregnant with another man&#39;s child. Again, we reached an impasse.</p>

<p>Flash forward to last week when we were watching tv when suddenly my husband turned off the tv. He held my hands together and told me that he loves me, that he&#39;s very sorry that he&#39;s infertile, and that he wants to start a family. There were tears in his eyes, which in turn made me cry as well.</p>

<p>He told me that he will allow a sperm donation if we all allow an egg donor as well. I was surprised and confused. He explained to me that he said that he felt like there would always be this cloud over his head that the child that he is raising is related to me, but not himself. He said if we did a double donation, then child would not be related to either one of us and we would be on &quot;equal terms&quot;. He said he would prefer to adopt, but that he is willing to meet me halfway because he knows that I want to be pregnant. I told him that I would think about it. And that &#39;s where I find myself today. </p>

<p>This procedure will cost us a lot more, but honestly that&#39;s not really a problem. Neither of us have a high paying job or anything, but we have both been financially responsible throughout our marriage. Money isn&#39;t an issue.</p>

So I have been seeing infertility for a little over a year. During this time I have been able to get pregnant once. Sadly, I lost the baby at 7 weeks back in November 2017. At that time I was just taking Clomid and Letrozole with timed intercourse. I have never been able to produce more than 1 or 2 follicles. Since then I have started taking the highest dose of Clomid, Letrozole, and Gonal f 75units for 6 days. Ovaries did not respond. Tried again with Gonal F 150units for 3 days, a shot of menopur, and still no response. Finally we decided to cancel for this cycle. I am assuming it is because I am under a ton of stress. Another thing is I was off of all of the meds for 2 months and just started them back up again so I was thinking maybe that is another reason why I have not responded this cycle.

We moved to our current RE over a year ago. We've deduced that there is nothing ""wrong"" with either of us (all tests come back ""normal"" and well within favorable range for each individual assessment) and numerous IUI's failed. We did IVF back in March and wound up with 12 embryos. That cycle we had a chemical pregnancy (our first hCG came back at 20) and we waited a few months to do our next FET. In July we had a positive hCG -- actually, our first three were really good (191, 1181, 4475) and then the day of our third hCG I started bleeding and that didn't end well.....

So now here we are, and I have no clue what to do now. I know we are way better off than some people, as we have numerous embryos and and and and. I know we have a lot to be thankful for, but right now I'm just lost. I don't have any idea what has gone wrong the last few rounds. I don't know where to go next. I just....don't know.

Is there anything y'all would be doing at this point that I'm not? Any more tests or diagnostics that you'd consider? Or would you just jump back into the FET's and soldier on? Am I being an emotional baby about this? Should I just suck it up and look towards our next cycle?

A nurse at our clinic suggested using leftover gonal f for the month in between our IUI and IVF, because she has noticed some people have better response after consecutive cycles with even low dose FSH. We don’t have a counterfactual, but I suspect that these two months of priming with 62.5iu contributed to our good results (12 eggs, 5 blasts).

We are looking at doing another retrieval if a couple of FETs don’t work, and I’m keen to replicate as much as we can about the first cycle. Right now I’m doing a completely natural FET cycle. If possible, I’d like to use gonal f to stim during FET2 (Sept), then do a regular gonal f TI cycle (Oct), ahead of retrieval in November. 

But another nurse at the clinic, who has an MA in repro stuff, said that she has never seen any evidence of low dose FSH having any impact on IVF outcomes. She reckons that using injectables would fuck up my estrogen and lining for the FET (though my IUI and TI cycles with gonal were fine—I always have a nice lining!?

So what say you? Is FSH during a FET cycle a problem? Is there any evidence that low doses prime antral follicles? Any other thoughts/comments?

149,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello All,

This is a cross post. 

I just wanted to share my experience with FemVue for anyone who is preparing for their appointment. 

Prior to the appointment I was instructed to take some Advil about an hour before the procedure. So, this morning at about 9:30 I took two 200mg Advil liquid gels took my multivitamins and grabbed a bottle of water for the road. Arrived at the RE’s office at 10:30. My husband and I sat in the parking lot for a few minutes so that I could eat a fruit cup (didn’t eat breakfast because of the slight anxiety) and I took another two Advil liquid gels. Got myself signed in, supplied a urine sample for a pregnancy test and sat it the waiting room for a while. 11:00 and we were ushered to the exam room, I was instructed to empty my bladder if needed, undress from the waist down and sit on the table. RE came in and she gave me a quick recap of the procedure: she would first manually feel for my cervix and clean it, insert the speculum, slide the catheter through my cervix,  and insert the wand, then push the saline solution through my uterus and Fallopian tubes. 

So, I sat on the table and put my feet in the stirrups. The first part was just like when you go for a pap.  Inserting the catheter wasn’t all that bad, at first, but when it expanded, it caused cramping and sharp pain at my cervix that sort of radiated down the inside of my thighs. Not incredibly painful and definitely bearable. If you’ve ever experienced a jolt of pain at your cervix with rough or deep intercourse, it’s maybe like that but it’s a sustained pressure type pain. I squinted and made a face and was tense because of the anxiety, but once I realized it wasn’t exactly painful I relaxed and was able to just lay there as she was explaining what we were looking at on the monitor. 

The nurse pumped the saline solution through the catheter as my RE controlled the wand and sonogram monitor. It was a little difficult at first to recognize what I was seeing, but my husband and I got to watch the bubbles flowing freely  (Both of my tubes were open. Yay! Good news there!). The nurse had to refill a second syringe with the saline solution part of the way through.  My RE pointed out the multiple follicles that are just hanging out on my ovaries (I’m annovulatory- “PCOS-ish” according to my RE). We also got to look at the walls of my uterus (smooth, no abnormalities). 

After she was done snapping the photos she needed, she removed the wand and catheter and advised that I might experience some cramping the rest of the afternoon with blood tinged saline solution being expelled. I went to the restroom to pee, clean up, and got dressed. 

It’s been about two hours now and I’ve had a few minor cramps here and there and a general moistness. I absolutely hate pads and liners (utilize menstrual cups during my period), so I just wore an old pair of panties today. There was no gushing of fluids or anything, so no biggie in that aspect. 

The whole process was very quick and methodical. My RE was clearly experienced with it. I’d say I was maybe on the table for 15-20min.

I find that we've been waiting and making more appointments, waiting some more, and doing some tests in between with no real action. Today, after 5 months of waiting, my partner finally saw the Urologist and gave us answers.

He immediately recognized that my partner has varicocele, an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum. Apparently this can cause them to become overheated, shrink the testicles, and result in reduced sperm production. My partner has Level 3. The great news is that he can have surgery that makes it possible for sperm to produce again. The bad news is that it means more waiting - to get into surgery, to wait 6 months post-surgery to see if any sperm is being produced - and only then can we actually move forward with any IVF treatment. If sperm is produced, it still wouldn't be enough to get pregnant naturally but we can do ISCI.

I just wanted to share our news in the hopes that it might help others. For months, we were convinced he had a genetic disorder, because his blood test results aligned with this theory, and we had no other answers. We already had decided that if a TESE failed, we would line up donor sperm as a back-up. We hadn't really considered that we could fix the problem and that it was physical.

It's very disheartening to go through all of this and not know whether it will even work. On top of it, my partner wants to plan our wedding and I do not want to book anything, because that's money that we might need for IVF.

I don’t participate outside of lurking for the most part. I find I don’t have anything valuable to add. Y’all are so knowledgeable and I’m just... not. So I’m sorry if it seems like I’m using you guys... I guess I kind of am. If you want to tel me to go away, I will. 

Backstory-my husband and I have been trying to conceive for four years. We found out he has a low sperm count and also a DNA issue. We moved on to IVF, and have been pregnant six times, losing 8 babies (twins twice). We did genetic testing and everything we could think of, but haven’t been able to overcome our issues. I was going to see a specialist (Braverman, or Aimee, at this sub’s prodding) but they requires certain testing to be done, so I’ve started knocking those off the list. One of the first was a hysteroscopy, laparoscopy and chromotubation. We didn’t expect to see anything since I just had an SIS in May (and an HSG in November), so we knew my tubes would be open. I’ve never had any cysts or polyps. I don’t have pain with my periods. So we were expecting a quick look around and that’s it. When I woke up from surgery, I was told the doc was inside for well over an hour because he found “a lot” of endo and he wanted to cauterize it. Side note, I know this isn’t preferred, but I didn’t bother seeing a specialist since there was no way I had endo. What a laugh. 🙄 anyway, he cauterized almost all of it. He left a small section on my bowel, because he recognized he wasn’t skilled enough and didn’t want to cause injury. Apparently my right tube was covered deeply, completely blocked (how?! I just had an SIS and it was open?!), and was leaking fluid. So he removed my right tube (yes, I cried. Thank god he left my ovary). 

Anyway, I’m mostly just lost. How is this possible? Everything I have ever heard about endo is that it’s almost obvious when you have it. I am SO lucky to have easy periods. There is no pain with intercourses. How can I have it? And how did my tube all of a sudden become so bad that it had to be removed?

It seems that we have had another big turnover of users here in r/infertility. We are always glad to see members graduate, and to welcome new users in to the fold. However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.

If you haven't already, please read our sidebar and/or the sticky post listing our rules. If you're on mobile you can find this under ""About of Community"" at the top of the page.

**Mention of pregnancy/ positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread.** Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C"". **Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules.** This is to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Sometimes mentions of children/pregnancy is painful. **Unsolicited mentions does include flair** - a reminder to keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

**Secondary infertility and those with prior success are allowed to participate here**.  Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions.  *Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success.* It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success.  Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed at the moderator's discretion.

**Set up flair which includes information on your age, diagnosis, treatment status, and current status.** This information is very helpful for our members when responding to questions. [Info on how to set up flair here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/74p8da/suggestions_for_new_members_flair_and_post_titles/)

**Use specific titles for your posts** to make them more easily searched by users. ""IVF?"" is not super helpful.  ""MFI and Endo, First round of IVF - Should we do ICSI?"" is helpful and easily searched.

**Be kind to one another.** There is no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.

**This is a science-minded, realistic, sometimes cynical sub.** There are many communities online for people who want a more ""positive"" or ""upbeat"" experience complete with baby du$t and those who are seeking ways to ""cure"" infertility with natural remedies, gimmicks or diet cleanses have many places to go. People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).

**Sex, embryos, and sperm.** These are the correct terms. Infertility isn't cute, and neither are the terms we use.  There has been an increase in automod triggers for banned terms/acronyms. Our sub prefers that [these acronyms/terms](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7t7092/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms_terms/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=infertility&utm_content=t5_2saej) are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.  AF means ""As Fuck"" and the use of AF for referring to a period is not allowed.

**No solicitations will be allowed for monetary or medication donations.** To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed. *Posts by members who want to donate their leftover meds to others here are allowed.*

**If you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button.** The ""report"" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment. This will help us to actively moderate this community and makes it easier to catch posts or comments that break our rules.

I absolutely love the clinic we go to and the REs and ARNPs there.  I do, however, have some concerns about the blowdraws/monitoring they do or lack there of.

First, I have PCOS.  They diagnosed me at our first appointment at our clinic, after years of being misdiagnosed as something different (but that's besides the point).  We ended up at the clinic after we found out that mu husband and I were dealing with MFI/azoospermia that has no treatment.  We decided to proceed with donor, researched clinics and sperm banks, and have been very happy with our care so far.

Here are my concerns, bulleted for ease of reading:

* They never did a Day 3 draw, so during my second cycle I requested one.  They drew for Estradiol and FSH but not progesterone.  They explained that the medications I was taking should give a boost of progesterone. (Provera/Femara/Pregnyl10000)
* They do not do 7DPIUI draws to check progesterone levels, for the same reason.  When I asked, I was told ""There is no correlation between higher progesterone levels and successful pregnancies.""   I then explained that my concern lies with my PCOS and sustaining a pregnancy, not whether higher levels indicate that I am pregnant earlier.  At the end of the day, I don't trust my body to make the correct hormones (I mean, I don't have a period without medication so...) and, since PCOS yields a higher instance of miscarriage I want to do everything possible to prevent it if I can.   


I know many clinics and doctors have differing opinions on bloodwork and such but I can't help but be concerned that they aren't being as proactive about this as I feel comfortable with.   Am I being paranoid?

I have taken zero medication, fertility related or otherwise this cycle. This has happened to me two months recently. With my previous 20+ cycles I never used pregnancy tests, and have only used pregnancy test two months out of my recent attempts to conceive (was never late enough to consider a pregnancy test and never tested prior to period due date).

The first time recently that I used one, I stupidly thought I was actually pregnant and ended up getting a blood test with my OBGYN which came back at 8mIU/mL. I ended up getting my period the day after the blood test. Same this month only I did not get a blood test this month, just had a positive digital clear blue test with morning urine and faintest rapid clear blue test with mid day urine.

Apologies first if I say something against the rules, tried reviewing the banned words and topics before writing this.

I wanted to inquire if anyone felt they wished they would of started the process to see a specialist earlier? My husband and I have NTNP for well over a year and tracking with OPKs and trying since Feb. No success and given our age (me 38 him 41) my gynecologist went ahead and ran the standard test (3 day blood, hsg, and SA for husband). Nothing came back alarming so we’ve just continued as normal, and last month I stepped up the game and started temping.

My doc had said to call her when and if we were ready to see a specialist and I’m starting to wonder if we should begin the problem process. I guess part of my thinking is of course our ages, but it’s already halfway through the year and once I meet my deductible I do have some infertility coverage (at least this year I do). 

I also don’t know how long it would potentially take to even get to the option of IUI once you get an initial appointment with RE specialist. Knowing how everything depends on cycles and timing I started thinking even if we get t an appointment next month it could be Oct or Nov before any treatment if they felt we should go that route.

I should note that other than age we don’t appear to have anything that should be preventing us.

I don’t want to jump the gun and would love nothing more than to have this process work with out the additional doc expenses and medications/procedures, but I also don’t want to get to the end of the year and facing my 39th birthday and wish we would of acted earlier.

Anyway, was hoping for some perspective from others who are now going through this.

Again I hope I didn’t use a banned word or phrase.

Thanks so much!


EDIT: I wanted to add that my husband and I just get married this year, we both found each other after previous marriages and while we are thankful our previous marriages didn’t result in children (given how difficult they were) we both have dreamed of having a family.

Venting: I'm trying to temper my expectations here. The testing and monitoring before I even get treatment is driving me nuts and wasting my money IMO. They have basically just watched me through two whole cycles an refuse to treat me until I get an HSG. So far I have taken provera to end an endless cycle then I seem to have started cycling(35+ days) on my own. There is basically only one day a cycle I can get the HSG since it has to be between cd6-12 and my RE only has access to the machine one day a week... they have now cancelled on me twice. From here we are waiting to see if we are going to do IUI or IVF. I know this whole process is hurry up and wait but damn I want to be waiting for something different for a change. 



Tomorrow I have a phone appointment with my insurance case manager (this is a requirement for infertility treatment). I was really hoping to be outlining a plan for future cycles with her but I guess not. I am considering bitching to her and having her check how much of my insurance lifetime cap has been burnt through. I feel like my RE office is treating me like money is no object but eventually it will be an object once they exhaust my insurance. 



I know I'm being whiney and impatient. I know I need to chill my chaplupas. The thing that frustrates me the most is that I ovulate very late (if at all) so they could do an HSG later without risk, but they won't because they seem to always assume I'm pregnant?? Each time they rescheduled has set me back at least 35 days. I know they have to follow procedure and cover themselves but... I know I'm not pregnant that's why I'm going to you! I feel like I am perpetually 2 months out from even being able to even try.

I am not supposed to be getting a period, yet here I am with what feels like the beginning of one. </p>

<p>I was worried the treatment for the UTI was going to mess up our plans for fertility treatments, but now it seems my vagina is going to mess that up for us anyway. I’m worried what this means for the endometriosis as well. The Aygestin was supposed to suppress everything so that when I come off of it, it will help us conceive, but if this is more than a breakthrough bleed then what does that mean? I don’t know how quickly I can expect the endometriosis to grow and now I am worried. </p>

265,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi friends. I've been around for awhile, commenting here and there, and while I have this down time I figured it would be a good time to properly introduce myself!

I am 33. Husband is 40.  
TW!: We got spontaneously pregnant in Feb 2012 after less than a year of dating (I know, what a bitch). I was 26 and definitely not ready to have a baby. After a ton of discussion, we opted to have an elective D&C. No complications. We got married a year later and lived life for a bit.

We started trying in September 2016 fully expecting to get pregnant right away because of that history (LOL). I had been having regular 30 day cycles at that point, with a 14 day luteal phase. Nothing, month after month. My April 2017 cycle never resulted in a period - I went to my gyno in early May, who suggested we wait a bit. Nothing in May. Went back into gyno early June and did bloodwork and ultrasound. I was diagnosed with ""borderline PCOS"" - I have polycystic ovaries and elevated testosterone (113 H ng/dL total), but no other symptoms. We did three rounds of Letrozole and timed intercourse, one round including an HCG trigger, which brought us up to October 2017. I was referred to an RE at a major fertility clinic here in SoCal and started taking Ovasitol. 

At this point, I am so frustrated and confused. We were able to get pregnant before! WTF! Every month got sadder and sadder. Friends of mine who I talked about ""starting to try"" with were getting pregnant, or about to give birth. RE confirmed the borderline aspect of my PCOS. I asked to be put on Metformin even though I am not insulin resistant, because I felt like I needed to do SOMETHING, and after a bumpy start with that, have been on 500mg of the extended release version a day since January. We continued trying ""naturally"" with no luck. I did, and continue to do, every PCOS / AIP / Paleo / Dairy Free / Gluten Free diet known to man. 

Finally did the HSG in April - ow! Uterus is great and no issues, right tube is great and no issues, but they couldn't get imaging of my full left tube (distal blockage). Lab tech tells the RE it is blocked and not patent. Follow up with the RE day after HSG, she confirms the left tubal blockage and suggests two cycles of IUI with FSH injectables. As I am wrapping my head around ""injectables,"" and ""blocked tube,"" RE calls back to say that, now that she's watched the DVD of my HSG, she thinks my tube *seized* instead of being blocked. That's a relief, so we immediately move ahead to Follistim, HCG, and IUI. We are super fortunate that husband has NO PROBLEMS, in fact, has lots of great sperm!

I had zero issues with the Follistim injections (I was always on a very low dose) - husband did 99.9% of them and was a pro. Must have watched the injection video 100 times! We were hopeful, but not excited. I think I was just focusing on the newness of everything I was doing, and getting used to all the bloodwork and ultrasounds. We had two good follicles when we triggered - one on each side (18mm, 17mm), though of course the left was dominant. May IUI did not work. I was disappointed, but not surprised. I kept thinking, ""the second one will work, the second one will work,"" so we went into the June IUI SUPER EXCITED, really trying to be positive. I added acupuncture to this cycle. I had three great follicles - 18mm, 18mm, 17mm - all on the left ovary. Still, the RE didn't seem concerned. We did two inseminations. Everything has always looked good, but particularly this cycle: Day 3 FSH was 5.79, LH 3.48; two days before trigger lining was 8.9 and E2 was 526.46. It doesn't work and we are crushed. 

We went in to the RE to do a follow up and discuss next steps on 7/5. She advised against a laparoscopy or anything else to try and look at or clear the tube, and against redoing the HSG. I did CA-125 bloodwork which was negative for endometriosis. Since that was the case, I didn't want to do another IUI with everything being the same, since it just feels like peeing away money. So: IVF. 

RE recommended ICSI and PGS testing to us (our clinic doesn't do fresh transfers at all anyway) even though we don't have a male factor issue. We'd be spending so much money that I feel like, we might as well, and maybe save the pain and expense of multiple transfers. We have lots of travel coming up in the next couple of months, so we set our start date as two cycles from now. We're in limbo until early October. 

RE has been super optimistic this whole time. She was sure the IUI would work. Of IVF, she said, ""you have always been so responsive to meds, and with your age and AMH level (3.49), you will only need one retrieval for two kids."" She thinks I'll get 15-25 eggs. Okay. I'm afraid to trust her optimism. I'm not afraid of the injections, or endless appointments, or crazy diets, or supplements, or more acupuncture, or surgery, or INSANE COST, or anything - I am just afraid that it won't work. I'm sure that is a familiar feeling to all of you. September will be two years, and while I know there are so many who have been at it for so much longer, and in worse situations than us, I'm just sad. I'm so ready for a baby.

This community has helped me so much, even if I haven't posted a ton, just reading your stories and cheering or virtually hugging alongside you all has been really meaningful, and I felt more comfortable making the decision to move to IVF because of it. So - THANK YOU. I'll leave you with one small LOL: our clinic offers ""extended services"" to their VIP patients (because the clinic sees a LOT of celebrities) and they offered it to us. For an extra $5,500 (on top of the $26,000 you are already paying), you don't have to wait in the lobby, a nurse will administer all of your shots every day, and you get ""priority access"" to the embryoscope.

266,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I am a single 36 yo woman who decided to freeze my eggs earlier this year. I desperately want kids someday but hoped to wait until I was in a committed relationship. I went for testing in March and while genetics looked good, my ovarian reserve was low for someone of my age. I decided to try anyway. 

I started my first cycle this month with Cetrotide and an estrogen patch for 3 days leading up to my day 1. Then starting on day 1, I began with 150 Menopur and 300 Gonal F nightly. On my 5th day of stim there were no measurable follicules and estrogen was between 100-200 so they upped my Menopur to 300. Day 6 my estrogen was a little over 200 so they told me to continue and on Day 7 introduce Cetrotide back in.

Hope it's helpful to someone!

These costs were for treatment at a small private capital city clinic, with Medicare. Because I had already hit the Medicare safety net, we got quite a bit more back for our first cycle than we otherwise would have\*

$5400 ICSI cycle cost charged by the clinic (includes all consultations, bloods, scans, nurse consultations, hypothetical fertility specialist consult--though we have only had contact with the nurses--and fresh transfer (after Medicare rebate--total cost $9500)

$1900 day surgery cost (part of this might have been covered by private health insurance if I'd had infertility coverage--but I would have paid that much for the insurance itself!)

$150 anaesthetist (After Medicare--total cost $500)

$120 5x 900iu Gonal F pens, 10x Ganirelix injections, one Ovidrel trigger shot (PBS subsidised price)

$80 30x 400mg progesterone pessaries (not covered by PBS--200mg are so I'm going to ask for them next time)

$5? 6x panadeine forte after the procedure (covered by PBS)

Total out of pocket cost: $7655 EDIT:plus $260 for sperm freeze just in case.

Total cost without Medicare/PBS (only available to citizens and permanent residents): approx $13,000 (hard to calculate properly because the meds vary)

\*The safety net threshold is about  $2100 per single/couple and calculated per calendar year--but the point at which you hit the safety net and start getting an additional rebate is calculated after each procedure, so you have to get there BEFORE the cycle, you won't receive it during even though you'll obviously go over $2100--that's probably clear as mud!

Prior to this cycle we had an appt with the specialist (OOP \~$200 incl one tracked cycle), and an AFC scan/ultrasound checkup (OOP \~$120).

I also had a \~$180 appt with an obstetric surgeon before laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, endo scratch (D&C--he was THOROUGH), some sort of analysis of the scrapings, and a dye test in a public hospital ($0, 90 day waiting list).

Then an IUI cycle, which was $1800 after medicare rebate (before hitting the safety net--would have been $1650 after), plus $120 in PBS subsidised Gonal F, Ovidrel, and 200mg progesterone.

There was enough Gonal F left over to do a medicated non IUI cycle after the IUI, which just cost $100 for the tracking and $60 for the trigger (non PBS price--it and Gonal are only covered if you're doing ART)

Has anyone ever decided to take quite a long break from trying to have a baby? After 4 losses and 2+ years at this, I don’t think I can be pregnant again. The thought of getting pregnant is terrifying and I find myself thinking about ways to prevent getting pregnant because I can’t stomach it.

CW: c section surgery 

I’m turning 39 in a few weeks. I had intraoperative complications during a c section in January of 2017. Large 12 cm fibroid had to be removed during the surgery which caused massive bleeding, long surgical time, and a bad recovery. 

In May of 2017 I had an abdominal myomectomy to remove remaining large fibroids because pregnancy attempts were not advised while they were still there. When my surgeon got in there he saw numerous fibroids, massive pelvic adhesions from the prior surgery, affecting bladder, ovaries, tubes, large and small bowel. Basically everything was fused together with scar tissue. 

Surgeon was a champ. Separated everything. When he separated bladder from uterus, basically my uterus fell apart and there was a large hole in it. He could see down to my cervix. He separated everything, removed several 10 cm+ and multiple other smaller fibroids. Consulted with an RE during surgery because he knew the point of this was preserving my fertility if possible. Sewed up my uterus, put a ballon catheter in to reduce further scar tissue. 

Post op I did as well as can be expected. Consulted with the RE after. HSG showed normal fill and spill. Blood work was good re AMH and FSH especially for my age, 19 antral follicles on day 3. That was August 2017. We were given the clear to start trying January 2018. 

No success with timed intercourse since January 2018. I know that’s not a long time, but given my age and complications I got referral to another RE (I moved across the state since then). I believe I’m ovulating with regular cycles and confirmed with BBT. Multiple follow up SIS show obvious scar in my uterus, definitely high risk, but not antithetical to pregnancy. 

I guess I’m just sharing for thoughts on this situation. Any questions I should ask RE specific to my situation? Anyone been through something similar? Should I jump right to IVF if recommended? I’m concerned about my age. Thanks for reading.

Hi my name is ChronicallyClassy and my ovaries grow cysts the size of tennis balls like it’s their job. (Functional cysts.)

Prior to my first RE visit last week, I decided to write a letter. There is only one thing that will make me sob hysterically - being frustrated beyond words. My medical history is full of frustration.

I didn’t see writing a letter suggested anywhere and initially wrote it out to prepare my speech as if it were an important work conversation or presentation. I thought maybe if I printed it out and handed it over the RE might think I’m crazy. I’ve been told I’m crazy (in not so many words) by doctors many times. First as I sought treatment for my hypothyroidism symptoms. More recently I’ve been repeatedly told by multiple doctors that my cysts can’t be as big/frequent as I think, they’re not a problem for fertility, and that I shouldn’t be worried about ovarian cystectomies/torsion impacting my ability to have a baby. Now that I’ve decided to find a doctor who is knowledgeable about my specific issues, maybe it’s good if an RE reads my letter and thinks I’m crazy. It would rule them out immediately and save me a lot of time.

My RE was very receptive to the letter (one of the CCRM locations), so I thought I’d share in case anyone else would find this helpful. Doc seemed to *like* the bullet points!

**The letter.** I wrote it after completing the intake paperwork, so I focused most on what didn’t fit on their blanks or might be confusing.

Dr. Name:

I’m coming to you because I have constant large ovarian cysts that either rupture or cause me to need surgery. I now know that the unexplained sudden pain I’ve had since a teen is what it feels like when a cyst ruptures and the fluid irritates my abdomen. This pain is the reason I began birth control in high school and took it for 15 years. Since then, any time I’ve gone off birth control I’ve had a cyst either the first or second cycle off it. In June of 2017 my husband and I hit our financial goals to make it possible for me to quit birth control long enough to start a family, even if it meant the missed workdays would negatively impact my employment prior to pregnancy.

In the last year I’ve had 2 cystectomies and 3 obvious ruptures.

* August 25, 2017 - left cystectomy, 2nd cycle off BC.
* Going forwards, I decided to begin tracking my cycle and ovulation to increase chances of quick conception.
* November 5, 2017 - cyst rupture pain CD17 (ovulation CD11), 5th cycle since BC.
* December 1, 2017 - cyst rupture pain CD17 (ovulation CD14), 6th cycle since BC.
* January - April 2018 - Partial Molar Pregnancy
* May 23, 2018 - right ovarian torsion & cystectomy CD9 (ovulation CD16). 10th cycle since BC.
* July 1, 2018 - left ovarian cyst rupture CD19 (ovulation CD14), 11th cycle since BC.

Before each surgery I have been warned of the main risk, I “might loose an ovary” in surgery. I think if cysts and surgery keep happening so frequently, I will become that statistic.

My cysts are so normalized to me that I struggle to notice symptoms until they become severe. Plus they grow very fast, seemingly too fast to obtain an appointment to diagnosis and discuss options quick enough to have any effect on the outcome. My most recent right cyst began causing minimal abdominal discomfort on a Wednesday, by Friday I became suspicious I had a cyst about to rupture, by Tuesday evening it became too painful to tolerate and I went to the ER, surgery to correct the torsion was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. My most recent left cyst was nonexistent during that surgery, measured 6.8cm three weeks later at a post-op appointment where I was able to obtain an immediate sonogram, and ruptured 5 weeks after surgery (as confirmed by sonogram 2 days after rupture.) And looking at my history, if I had been able to detect the cysts and try going back to birth control briefly, I would have only been off it for a few cycles in the past year - making the odds of a positive pregnancy test very low.

I don’t know what to do. My husband and I do not feel like we’re on a path to become parents. I feel like I am on a path to loose my ovaries. I’m here hoping to find out what effect these ruptures, the ovarian torsion, and surgeries are having on my fertility? Is it possible to become pregnant in a cycle with a large cyst rupture or cystectomy? What is your advice regarding my concerns?

ChronicallyClassy

**The plan**

RE has another patient with the same issues! I’m not crazy, not some kind of medical abnormality. Apparently the current running theory is that constant huge cysts are cause by pituitary dysfunction. RE recommends that I take HBC unless doing active treatment in order to prevent cysts and preserve my remaining fertility.

Since we are paying out of pocket, we’ve just agreed to pay for testing at this point. Had blood draws done at LabCorp in hopes that insurance will at least pay for some of the labs. We’ll stop and evaluate before our next steps.

I’ve lurked here extensively. I just want to say you all are wonderful and thank you for sharing so much information. I’m sorry any of us have to be here, but I’ve been glad that I’ve had a realistic, science-based community to lurk in. I hope to have more to share going forwards.

<p>Hi my name is ChronicallyClassy and my ovaries grow cysts the size of tennis balls like it’s their job. (Functional cysts.)</p>

<p>Prior to my first RE visit last week, I decided to write a letter. There is only one thing that will make me sob hysterically - being frustrated beyond words. My medical history is full of frustration.</p>

<p>I didn’t see writing a letter suggested anywhere and initially wrote it out to prepare my speech as if it were an important work conversation or presentation. I thought maybe if I printed it out and handed it over the RE might think I’m crazy. I’ve been told I’m crazy (in not so many words) by doctors many times. First as I sought treatment for my hypothyroidism symptoms. More recently I’ve been repeatedly told by multiple doctors that my cysts can’t be as big/frequent as I think, they’re not a problem for fertility, and that I shouldn’t be worried about ovarian cystectomies/torsion impacting my ability to have a baby. Now that I’ve decided to find a doctor who is knowledgeable about my specific issues, maybe it’s good if an RE reads my letter and thinks I’m crazy. It would rule them out immediately and save me a lot of time.</p>

<p>My RE was very receptive to the letter (one of the CCRM locations), so I thought I’d share in case anyone else would find this helpful. Doc seemed to <em>like</em> the bullet points!</p>

<p><strong>The letter.</strong> I wrote it after completing the intake paperwork, so I focused most on what didn’t fit on their blanks or might be confusing.</p>

<p>Dr. Name:</p>

<p>I’m coming to you because I have constant large ovarian cysts that either rupture or cause me to need surgery. I now know that the unexplained sudden pain I’ve had since a teen is what it feels like when a cyst ruptures and the fluid irritates my abdomen. This pain is the reason I began birth control in high school and took it for 15 years. Since then, any time I’ve gone off birth control I’ve had a cyst either the first or second cycle off it. In June of 2017 my husband and I hit our financial goals to make it possible for me to quit birth control long enough to start a family, even if it meant the missed workdays would negatively impact my employment prior to pregnancy.</p>

<p>In the last year I’ve had 2 cystectomies and 3 obvious ruptures.</p>

<ul>
<li>August 25, 2017 - left cystectomy, 2nd cycle off BC.</li>
<li>Going forwards, I decided to begin tracking my cycle and ovulation to increase chances of quick conception.</li>
<li>November 5, 2017 - cyst rupture pain CD17 (ovulation CD11), 5th cycle since BC.</li>
<li>December 1, 2017 - cyst rupture pain CD17 (ovulation CD14), 6th cycle since BC.</li>
<li>January - April 2018 - Partial Molar Pregnancy</li>
<li>May 23, 2018 - right ovarian torsion &amp; cystectomy CD9 (ovulation CD16). 10th cycle since BC.</li>
<li>July 1, 2018 - left ovarian cyst rupture CD19 (ovulation CD14), 11th cycle since BC.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before each surgery I have been warned of the main risk, I “might loose an ovary” in surgery. I think if cysts and surgery keep happening so frequently, I will become that statistic.</p>

<p>My cysts are so normalized to me that I struggle to notice symptoms until they become severe. Plus they grow very fast, seemingly too fast to obtain an appointment to diagnosis and discuss options quick enough to have any effect on the outcome. My most recent right cyst began causing minimal abdominal discomfort on a Wednesday, by Friday I became suspicious I had a cyst about to rupture, by Tuesday evening it became too painful to tolerate and I went to the ER, surgery to correct the torsion was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. My most recent left cyst was nonexistent during that surgery, measured 6.8cm three weeks later at a post-op appointment where I was able to obtain an immediate sonogram, and ruptured 5 weeks after surgery (as confirmed by sonogram 2 days after rupture.) And looking at my history, if I had been able to detect the cysts and try going back to birth control briefly, I would have only been off it for a few cycles in the past year - making the odds of a positive pregnancy test very low.</p>

<p>I don’t know what to do. My husband and I do not feel like we’re on a path to become parents. I feel like I am on a path to loose my ovaries. I’m here hoping to find out what effect these ruptures, the ovarian torsion, and surgeries are having on my fertility? Is it possible to become pregnant in a cycle with a large cyst rupture or cystectomy? What is your advice regarding my concerns?</p>

I have done 3 rounds of IVF total with the first 2 rounds I had 3 failed transfers. The last round of IVF I did PGD testing to see if thats why the transfers were failing, and produced 2 PGD normal embryos.

I have had a laparoscopy/Hysteroscopy surgery for suspected endo but we found nothing, everything looked perfect. I have been tested for NK cells and they are in the normal range.  

I have just had a failed 4th transfer with a hatching AA PGD normal embryo.  No CP, nothing. The only thing she changed was a trigger with 5000 Pregnyl with 3 x 1500 Pregnyl shots after transfer.

My problem is that my specialist doesn't know what to do and seems to be okay with transferring my last frozen embryo without changing anything in the protocol.

We consulted a bit on my u/s’s and Mri and he wanted to do an u/s in his office. Turns out I have a very normal right ovary. This is the same ovary at my OBGYNs office they told me they wanted to remove due to a large endometrioma. The left ovary is behind my uterus, and there is a large cyst chilling around the ovary. It shows no signs of endometrioma and that doctor thinks it was not right to say I have endo because he can’t see any signs on u/s and he’s seen 1,000s of endometrioma and has published numerous articles on them. He wants to do an HSG, and day 3 blood work which is awesome.

For the last year I have been getting. bad UTIs that are mostly asymptomatic but are very resistant to antibiotics. In the meantime I was trying to conceive and saw a fertility specialist earlier this year. I was pretty certain my problem was endometriosis, and then we found out one of my tubes was blocked. After much trying my OB did a laparoscopy and cleared the endo last month. He then put me on a suppressive treatment for three months (currently starting month 2) and he said that once I was done I would repeat the HSG and then we would go all on with trying to conceive. While this all sounded good, the damn urinary infections keep coming back.

I've been seeing a special urologist and we have done everything we can. When I had my lap he was going to do a cystoscopy but we were unable to do it because I had a UTI going into surgery so he didn't feel comfortable doing it because of the heightened risk of infection. We tried to treat it and now I went for a follow up on Saturday and the infection is still not gone. He is sending me to an even more specialized doctor. I asked him what that meant for our plans trying to conceive and he wasn't clear. All he mentioned was the risk of miscarriage in case of a kidney infection (which thank God, it has never gone beyond my bladder).

I haven't spoken to my OB yet, but I am scared that this will now mean that we went through with the lap for nothing. I am scared both doctors will tell me it's best I put off trying to conceive until the infections are under control. I know this is the reasonable thing to do, but it hurts my heart so much, but what do you guys think? If I am able to get things straight technically I have two full months to get the infection addressed in time to resume my fertility treatments. Maybe more depending on when my cycle actually comes back (my OB said it could take up to 30 days to get my cycle back. My last pill on the treatment is on September 12th and I see him on the 21st. If I have my cycle by then, I should be starting on Femara around that time). But I don't know.

I feel so lost and defeated. What do you guys think? What do you think I should do? I know I can't stay on this suppressive medication forever but I also know it's hard to know how quickly the endo will grow back once I stop it.
