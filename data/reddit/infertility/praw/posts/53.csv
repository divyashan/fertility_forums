*8 were mature 
*5 fertilized
*5 made it to day 3
*2 made it to day 5

This caused me to decide to stop doing IUI's all together and just focus on getting to IVF in March. Now, my period should show up today or tomorrow and I will have another ultrasound this week to see whether the cyst is gone. 

Here are the potential scenarios:

1. The cyst is gone. YAY. Hold tight and move forward with IVF in March.
2. The cyst is smaller, but not gone. If this is the case, I'd probably roll the dice and hope that it keeps shrinking in the next month and stick with the plan to do IVF in March.
3. The cyst is neither gone nor smaller. Then I have to decide whether I take birth control to make it shrink.

That being said, I know a lot of people *do* take BC beforehand, so maybe it wouldn't be the worst? Basically, I don't want to delay IVF another month if I can help it, but I also don't want to have a shit outcome because I'm over suppressed.

Obviously far too high to conceive on my own.  Based upon that she said we should move straight to IVF (I have frozen eggs).  

Two months of baseline testing and new appointments, we started with estrogen patches on Nov. 12.  4 weeks later my lining just couldn't thicken beyond 5.5.  so they canceled the cycle and had me restart.  I started again around Christmas at a higher dose, this time with patches and pills.  4 weeks later...same result; never got above 5.7.  

Their recommendation is to do this a THIRD time but now with just pills instead of patches because they think my  body isn't absorbing the patches.  No one has shared any of the bloodwork labs or results with me, the nurse just calls and tells me what to do.  At this last meeting I told the nurse flat out that I did not want to do another cycle unless there was a new plan because obviously my body is not responding.  So, their solution was just pills. 

I happened to see my oncologist on Monday and cried to her (she's such a lovely woman!) about my frustration.  She said she thought it was a good time to run a full panel of labs on me to make sure everything else looked good.  Well, three big results:

1. My TSH (thyroid) was more than triple what it was a year ago.  Still within normal limits but up from 1.5 to 4.8.  So my endocrinologist got ahold of that and has changed my dosage.

2. My estrogen is sky high, which means the patches *are* absorbing.  

3.  ...my FSH was NORMAL. It was <1 

I'm floored.  I don't know if my RE hasn't been checking my FSH with blood tests, if she knew and didn't tell me, or if this is a result of the supplemental estrogen.  I was so furious I almost called them in that exact moment and told them to give me my money back. 

At this point I've booked an initial consult with a new RE for Monday.  This new RE comes recommended by my oncologist personally and has extensive experience with oncofertility.  I mean, at this point with a normal FSH I might be able to actually conceive naturally, but who knows?

We’ve been trying for 4-5 years, with 2 chemical pregnancies that happened on their own l. I have PCOS. we’ve done multiple femara Cycles, TI w/ 10’days worth of injections, and an IUI cycles w/ injections. We switched RE’s and love the new one we saw for our IUI. 

Apparently they specialize in a procedure called IVM which is still experimental in the US. It encompasses IVF, but instead of stemming the follicles w/ meds, they do the retrieval while they’re still immature. Then they mature them in vitro, then fertilize, freeze the embryos & transfer. 

Anyone familiar with it? We signed up for April. Hoping for some good news...the wait is driving me crazy though.

(Also, I’m moping around today. I found out a close friend is 20 weeks pregnant w/ her first. She didn’t know how to tell me, so she kept it on the DL for awhile.)

58,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone!

Thanks to all of you for sharing so much information with this community--I've been soaking up knowledge here since my first RE appointment back in November but things are just now starting to move forward and I could use some advice.

**Background:** I've been on and off HBC for years and always had very regular, mostly pain-free cycles off the pill so I wasn't too worried about my fertility. But last year, a few months into actively trying, my period started going crazy: debilitating cramps, 14-day cycles, endless spotting, etc. When I finally got to meet with an RE, she suspected that the HSG would reveal uterine fibroids or something similar. The HSG was a sort of horrible experience for me (the radiologist couldn't get the fluid into my uterus and needed a gynecologist to dilate my cervix, has anyone else dealt with this?) but the results were perfect, yay!

Except further testing turned up an antral follicle count of 6/4 and my AMH is 0.65 (I'm only 30). So the diagnosis is severe diminished ovarian reserve and my doctor wants us to start IVF as soon as possible (skipping IUI).

**But here's my concern:** from what I can tell, DOR isn't likely to cause the symptoms I've been experiencing. My doctor said a normal HSG isn't enough to *totally* rule out the uterine factor and if we want to be really thorough, we could do a saline infusion sonogram as well. She didn't push for it and now I'm completely on the fence. It would mean postponing IVF for another cycle and I'm scared that it will be as tortuous as the HSG (although would I be allowed to have my husband in the room? that would really help). If it turns up nothing, it just seems like a waste of time and money. 

Any reactions to all this? Any examples of DOR wreaking havoc on your menses without other underlying issues? Does anyone regret NOT doing further testing before starting IVF? I want to have as complete a picture as possible but my body really doesn't react well to all the poking--as if anyone's does.

Thank you!

60,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Mr. Friend and I stumbled across [this article](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/sperm-donor-dna-testing-1.4500517) from CBC last night and found it to be a ""woah, never thought of that"" kind of moment.

When Mr. Friend and I first discussed using a sperm donor, our knee-jerk reaction was to use an anonymous donor.  We figured, we'll be our child's parents, we will love him or her so much and raise them so well that they'll never need more than us right?

After contemplating, we ended up considering that maybe we shouldn't make that decision on our child's behalf, after all, he or she will be an adult one day themselves, and to our point above, if we raise them right they should be more than capable of making their own responsible decision regarding contacting their biological parent.  So, we landed on a preference to use an identity options donor.  

But, through this process, and especially here in Canada, we've run into so many issues with supply and demand, long waits for popular donors, and lack of inventory, that for our current cycle, we've decided to proceed with an anonymous donor.  Mr. Friend and I haven't quite figured out what our approach would be if we're ever lucky enough to explain the circumstance to a child, but we're hopeful that we'll be able to strike a balance between satisfying curiosity and respecting the wishes of the donor.

<p>When Mr. Friend and I first discussed using a sperm donor, our knee-jerk reaction was to use an anonymous donor.  We figured, we&#39;ll be our child&#39;s parents, we will love him or her so much and raise them so well that they&#39;ll never need more than us right?</p>

<p>After contemplating, we ended up considering that maybe we shouldn&#39;t make that decision on our child&#39;s behalf, after all, he or she will be an adult one day themselves, and to our point above, if we raise them right they should be more than capable of making their own responsible decision regarding contacting their biological parent.  So, we landed on a preference to use an identity options donor.  </p>

<p>But, through this process, and especially here in Canada, we&#39;ve run into so many issues with supply and demand, long waits for popular donors, and lack of inventory, that for our current cycle, we&#39;ve decided to proceed with an anonymous donor.  Mr. Friend and I haven&#39;t quite figured out what our approach would be if we&#39;re ever lucky enough to explain the circumstance to a child, but we&#39;re hopeful that we&#39;ll be able to strike a balance between satisfying curiosity and respecting the wishes of the donor.</p>

<p>While I completely understand and am sympathetic to the motivations of the donor-conceived people in the article who wish to learn more about their genetic identity, we thought it was unfortunate that this kind of sleuthing could become a real deterrent for people to donate in the first place.

In our meeting this morning, another manager happily announced that his direct report is pregnant. What the hell??? Most of us already knew, but for some reason, the public announcement of it hit me hard. Also, it’s not his f***n’ news to share! I left that meeting taking deep breaths and fighting back tears, and I had to take a few moments to compose myself for my next meeting.  

The second trigger was a one-two punch at yet another meeting this afternoon, in which that manager who was so happy about his staff member’s pregnancy announced it yet again (slightly bigger audience this time). I actually handled that one okay. Then, while making a point relevant to our work, a coworker joked that she’ll never be pregnant again (she has 2 kids), as in she has no desire to have any more. I was able to control my response for a few minutes, and then had to excuse myself from the meeting. I had a good cry in the bathroom.

87,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all, I posted a few weeks back about my results from my RE and am now 3 days post-op. I thought I would give a little update for those of you following along or in a similar situation. 

My surgery was in an outpatient surgery center Monday morning. The nurse numbed my hand before putting my IV in (how luxurious though right? Didn't feel a thing.) They took me back to the OR at 9am and I was heading home at 11:30am. I had general anesthesia so I was all the way under. I have two small incisions on my stomach from the laporoscopy. I was prescribed oxycodone for pain and phenergan for nausea. 

When I got home on Monday I had some broth and Gatorade (my throat was very sore from the intubation) and then slept until my husband got home from work. For dinner I had some soup and half a grilled cheese which I threw up shortly afterwards. Thankfully, I haven't thrown up since that first night. 

I was really unsure of how long I would need to take off work (I'm a teacher) so I took the whole week. Now I am glad that I did because I have a lot of soreness and the pain pill makes me sleep all day. I've also had heavy cramping from the D&C I assume.

I thought I would give a little update for those of you following along or in a similar situation. </p>

<p>My surgery was in an outpatient surgery center Monday morning. The nurse numbed my hand before putting my IV in (how luxurious though right? Didn&#39;t feel a thing.) They took me back to the OR at 9am and I was heading home at 11:30am. I had general anesthesia so I was all the way under. I have two small incisions on my stomach from the laporoscopy. I was prescribed oxycodone for pain and phenergan for nausea. </p>

<p>When I got home on Monday I had some broth and Gatorade (my throat was very sore from the intubation) and then slept until my husband got home from work. For dinner I had some soup and half a grilled cheese which I threw up shortly afterwards. Thankfully, I haven&#39;t thrown up since that first night. </p>

<p>I was really unsure of how long I would need to take off work (I&#39;m a teacher) so I took the whole week. Now I am glad that I did because I have a lot of soreness and the pain pill makes me sleep all day. I&#39;ve also had heavy cramping from the D&amp;C I assume.</p>

<p>I am blessed to be getting to raise my grand-niece, and actually getting to adopt her soon, but I&#39;ve already dreamed of having my own child. This is also a dream of my husbands. </p>

<p>Sorry, i&#39;m long winded.</p>

Hi everyone! 
I'm new to reddit in general.
But since starting IVF, I've been glued to this forum (Because you have the best members!!).

I am native Korean and live in Korea. 
So I go back and forth between here and a Korean forum.
I can say, some of the recommendations in the Korean forum and Reddit (I'm guessing mostly US-based) differ from time to time... 
Also the forums have different vibes. 
Anyway all culture aside! 

I'm desperate to keep myself from buying a stick test before my beta. So thought I'd share my transgression story to combat my stick test urge. 

So us Asians often have something called a conception dream. 
(If you wanna read up, here is the wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conception_dreams)
YOU don't necessarily have to dream it. Anyone close to you can dream it for you as well. Your parents, grandparents and siblings.. could be anyone! 

When my mom had me, a tiger leapt into her arms. 
When my mom had my brothers, she sunk her teeth into a precious looking peach.
The story goes on! Most people have a dream of some sort. 
Dragons, tigers, peaches, persimmon... Any powerful animal or juicy looking fruit usually appear in these dreams. 

So instead of buying a test stick - 
I started asking Mr. Mochi and mom if they had a conception dream for me. (This is my way of controlling my expectation I suppose.) 

No one dreamed anything (Okay, helps me keep my expectations low) 

To be fare, Mr. Mochi told me he dreamed little puppies nibbling his toes and legs. I flat out denied him and said it is JUST a DREAM not a conception dream. I probably didn't want him to get his hopes up including mine. 

The conception dream is my mini stick test. No dream is basically a single line LOL. Of course, this is me just trying to laugh my anxiety off, anyway, it is kind of working.

Every morning I run up Mr. Mochi and go,
""Do you have a dream for me!"" 
Every night I ring up mom and go,
""Did you dream last night?"" 
I can sort of go ""huurump! No dreams no babies you people!"" 

Anyone in TWW limbo?
Are you secretly transgressing? :D 
Join the club! We still have plenty of days to count! 

positive thoughts to everyone xoxoxo

I had a great discussion with my husband yesterday, and we decided we're taking a break from trying this cycle. My thermometer stores 60 temps, so I'll keep temping for the data, but I won't enter anything this month. I'll still wear my Ava bracelet, but since I still don't trust its predictions (it's been days off from FF), it's really just a period tracker right now. We have an appointment with the RE to go over the SAs from the two IUIs and discuss her thoughts on it (now that it makes 3 SAs total to look at). The nurse I spoke with today was super supportive and when I vented a little bit about how long the process is taking and how it feels ironic that we were able to conceive once on our own, but now the IUI isn't doing anything and his numbers are low so I don't feel super optimisitc about future IUI chances... she asked if he was taking any supplements (he's not), and recommended CoQ-10 and DHEA. I'm a tiny bit frustrated that the RE didn't mention these when we discussed the results of our first SA, because I specifically asked if there was anything he could do to help his numbers. But I mentioned it to my husband, who has historically been one to avoid medications and supplements if he can help it... but he agreed to pick some up today, without a fuss!

But the biggest thing we're doing is making an appointment with an adoption councilor! It's just an orientation, getting information about the process while we decide how much further we will go with ART. Adoption is in our future whether or not we have kids of our own, and while we were hoping to have our own first, it's exciting to take steps down this path! 

And unrelated to TTC, I've been working on my fitness... I've always been overweight and sedentary. For nearly a year now, I've been seeing a semi-personal trainer once a week (small group setting, 6 people max in the group), and I'm starting to notice the difference it has on my activity level motivation. I'm now looking to be more active throughout the week, getting cardio in along with the strength training. My husband is so supportive, we went looking at exercise machines yesterday, and ordered a rowing machine! I'm actually so excited and can't wait for it to arrive (Wednesday, hopefully). I've got less than 10 lbs to lose to get into the normal weight category, but as I'm currently in the best shape of my life, I'm content where I am and feeling good about my activity level.

132,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"After 3 failed IUIs last year, my wife and I decided to do reciprocal IVF. After her egg retrieval we ended up with just 1 PGS normal embryo.

When we had success with the transfer, we were overjoyed. Our betas started low but our first 3 ultrasounds were ""perfect"" according to our RE. When we had our first with our OB at 16 weeks, we were so blissfully naive. 

They immediately told us that he had fluid in his chest and his development wasn't normal. His arms were flexed and she couldn't really make out the legs bc they were so tucked under him.

We did an amniocentesis and waited 2 weeks. When the amniocentesis came back normal we found hope. Which of course was completely unfounded bc at 18 weeks things were worse.

I just made my intro post last week as unexplained (all tests came back good until now), but now I guess I have an explanation.  My HSG hurt like a motherfucker as he tried to push the dye harder to open up my right tube, but he couldn't get it open.  Since then I've been reading a shit ton of medical articles trying to see what my best options are moving forward.  My OB and RE said the treatment plan is up to me - wtf?  As far as I can tell there are three options:

1. Do a lap:  My RE mentioned this option first, but the more I read, the more I'm not so sure it's necessary (yet).

2.  Continue with medicated IUI's as planned, but only when I'm ovulating from my left for cost effectiveness.  Multiple studies have shown similar IUI results with one tube to people with unexplained infertility.  I won't link them because they're paywalled, but one from 2007 in Israel, one from 2012 in Seoul, one from 2016 in Turkey, and one from 2013 in Taiwan.  They put the percentages around 40% success with 3 IUI's.  This is the route I'm leaning towards.

3.  The American Society of Reproductive Medicine's recommendation is to do a procedure like an HSG where they continue pushing the catheter up into the blocked tube to clear it.  It's usually called a tubal cannulation or catheterization.  There are tons of research articles on it, and it seems way less invasive than a lap, but everyone looks at me weird like they have never heard of it when I suggest it!  Any idea what the deal is there?

This was after a skipped month, then a cancelled cycle, and finally a Natural Cycle FET.  Yet again, our beta was effectively zero.

Its been 18 months since our miscarriage (11 wks, trisomy 18), and since then we have not had a single hint of HCG. Thats 4 failed IUIs and 7 embryos over 6 transfers, all failed.  Our most recent was PGS normal.  Prior to the M/C we at least had C/Ps every third IUI like clockwork.  But nothing since.  The D&C supposedly went well, but maybe something went wrong?

Our last FSH cycle, we had great egg maturity and fertilization results, and 3 out of 5 embryos were PGS normal.  It seems we are producing good quality embryos.  While only our most recent embryos were tested, it seems likely that at least some of those previous 6 that were transferred were euploid as well.

Repeated saline sonos do not show any issues.  Repeated biopsies have shown mild endometritis which was cleared up with antibiotics. We investigated doing an ERA test, but it is not available in our state.

The uterine lining is always on  the thin side.  Its typically in the 7.5 to 8mm range a time of transfer.  But this has always been the case, even before the m/c.

Our next seems to be to push for a hysteroscopy, to make damn sure the saline sono didnt miss anything.  Perhaps yet another biopsy to see if the endometritis has returned.  Are there any other options or avenues to explore for a recurring implantation issue?

157,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So, at our RE appointment on Tuesday, we were told the chances of us naturally conceiving in any given month were less than 5%.  In addition, the husband and I are both cystic fibrosis carriers, so the RE is really pushing to go straight to IVF just so that we can test the embryos.  Just for context, no male issues, but my AMH is low (1.07) and my AFC was 7.  All my other hormone levels are fine, and the RE is also ordering adrenal tests just to make sure there isn't something else going on.  But so far, we've looked under all the rocks and come up with I just don't make very many eggs.  It could lead to early menopause, but maybe not, who knows.

At the moment, the spouse and I are looking into pricing for IVF.  The clinic we're currently at says that a full round, including estimated drug costs and PGD testing should run about $28,000 each round of IVF (including transfers).  Called another clinic in the same city, they said around the same price.  Our RE estimates we're looking at 0 to 2 healthy embryos ready for transfer in each cycle, so we're betting on multiple cycles.  If we do 3, for example, that puts us at $84,000, and the spouse is willing to do 4 rounds which would put us at $112,000.  This is a lot of money.

The final issue is that we're in California, and the insurance we have does cover IVF, but only one round, only half the cost, and does not cover drugs or collection of sperm/eggs.  I have a email out to them to see if they will cover some/all of the drugs under our regular insurance for any reason, and what exactly the insurance policy DOES cover for IVF, but I'm expecting more of a 30% off coupon than anything else.  And, after that we're on our own anyway.

That being said, I have been looking through the posts and googling trying to come up with what's likely to be the best deal.  So far, it's looking like it's not California, and we make too much income to qualify for a lot of the free/low-price clinics (we don't have a lot of spare cash though - took out student loans years ago before we knew we should be saving money for fertility treatments...)  That leaves us with domestic clinics or travelling internationally.

So, all that to say, I have a bunch of questions:

-Since we'll be doing multiple rounds and genetic testing, it seems like if we do international we'll just send me (and frozen sperm) and I'll just live internationally for several months (visitor visas often allow up to 90 days in country).  Is it really cheaper to go overseas altogether, even with travel and accommodation costs in country?  I have a business that I can run over the internet without too many issues, so I don't have to stop working, and the spouse has a job that he has to stay where we live.

-Is there a domestic service like IVF Concierge to help choose a domestic clinic?

-Is it difficult to get into the shared risk programs that are out there?  My clinic has sort of small version (that covers way less) but I don't qualify because my AMH and AFC are too low (I also have a BMI of 29, and they want 27 at the max, but the hormones seem like the bigger issue).  Have people experienced the same problems at places like Shady Grove?  I like their program because it covers 6 rounds, and we expect to do multiple.  My research says that with the shared risk program, drugs, testing and travel costs we're looking at about $60,000 which is basically two rounds at our current place.

-Are you someone who found a particularly good deal somewhere in the States?  How did you find it?

-Would it be worthwhile to put together a pricing spreadsheet that newbies could access to clinics we've all been to?  It might not, just because there are so many variables in treatment, monitoring, and drugs so it might be too unwieldy to be useful.  And I get people not wanting to share sensitive information.

It might not, just because there are so many variables in treatment, monitoring, and drugs so it might be too unwieldy to be useful.  And I get people not wanting to share sensitive information.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>So I started the progesterone vaginal tablets last night. I’m taking two a day now. I didn’t notice this from my first tablet last night (maybe because I was sleeping) but my second tablet has caused a lot of white discharge (I assume the tablet dissolved). Is this normal?

It took my parents between 8 and 9 years of marriage before they got their mojo going, so I was a little concerned but not too worried.  Long story short, the past year or so of my life have been doctors visits.  I was diagnosed primary hypogonadic and started treatment.  6 months into treatment, I had a semen analysis done and the result was azoospermia.    Started up with a new urologist who specializes in male fertility and started getting lots of tests done.  Another 6 months of fertility treatments and another semen analysis - still azoospermia (didn't think it was going to change, but whatever).  This is where I start getting confused and unfortunately, so does my doctor.  

There are two types of azoospermia - obstructive and non obstructive.  I have indicators of both.  
* Normal ejaculate volume ( strong indicator of nonobstructive)  
* Normal signaling hormone levels (usually indicates obstructive)  
* No change after a year of hormone treatments (can indicate obstructive or testicular failure - a possibility since I'm also hypogonadic)  
* No genetic abnormalities (can indicate obstructive)  

I just don't know what to do, right now.  We're to the part in the search for answers where my urologist is like ""lets just put you under, cut you up and see what we can find.""  I don't know if I should spend the money on the surgery or maybe put the money aside for adoption fees (if I can ever convince myself that I want to adopt).  The idea of jumping to surgery right now seems ludicrous. Like, surgery is what you do when you are sure you know the problem.  Once you're sure, you take the steps to resolve, but now it feels like they're just out of ideas.  

I know that they want to try to biopsy my testes while they're in there and gather some IVF viable sperm, if they can.  But IVF only has like a 20% success rate.  I'm starting to feel like having kids just isn't in the cards for me.  Now that I'm finally feeling ready to have a kid, I find out I can't.  It took me a handful of years to feel like I could even handle having a kid.  Now I'm not sure if I can handle the rest of this process only to have them come back and tell me ""well, you're just broken.""  My wife is looking to me for leadership/direction and I'm frozen.  What am I supposed to do ?  She has always wanted kids more than I did.  Don't get me wrong, I do too, but she want kids much more.

Hello everyone, I am /u/chanyolo and I am posting this with the blessing of the lovely mod team.

A bit about me: I've been a member of /r/infertility for almost 4 years now, but I am not around this sub much as I mostly post over at /r/IFSeniorClass. We've been through 4 IVFs after being told we are straight to IVF years ago (my husband is missing the cap to his sperm and I have bad egg quality) and are beginning our 5th and last cycle whenever my period comes next. Trust me, I love this sub, but hate being here as much as you all do!

The website: I am currently a graduate student at Bowling Green State University and one of my classes this semester is ""Science and Medical Writing."" For our final project, we are able to do anything ""informational"" or ""educational"" as long as it involves research. My plan is to create a website called ""Understanding Infertility"" that has information about ALL steps of infertility - from the beginning tests to donor, etc. - that can be accessed and used as a guide for anyone suffering. 

This is where I need your help.

I want to first say that all research will be done by me and I will **not** use your usernames, your stories, your comments or anything about you. This is 100% anonymous and is just for **ideas** that I can put on the website because I don't want to miss anything when doing my research. There is still so much I don't know even though I've been through the ringer myself and I just want to make sure I've touched on almost everything I can. 

*My plan for the pages and subpages so far*

> Home Page

* Introduction to the website / infertility

* The history of ART

* The future of ART 

* My story / Contact me

> Common Problems Page 

* Female Factor (PCOS, Endo, Blocked Tubes, Polyps, Cysts, Egg Quality, etc)

* Male Factor (low sperm count, morphology, azoo, oligo, etc)

* Unexplained 


> Getting Started Page 

* OBGYN -vs- RE

* OPKs, Temping, Clomid and Femara

* TI

* RE Testing (HSG, AMH, FSH, hysteroscopy, etc)


> IUI

* What is IUI? 

* IUI Process

* IUI w/ injectables

* Donor sperm


> IVF

* What is IVF? 

* IVF Process

* Mini IVF

* Donor eggs


> FAQs

* FAQs about infertility 

* Acronyms 

* Myths and Facts (acupuncture, HSG fertility rate boost, PINEAPPLE CORE, etc)

* Vitamins and Supplements (Vitamin D, CoQ10, DHA, etc)

* Support Groups

* (I want to include a page of what NOT to say to infertile people, but I feel like that won't be very ""scientific"" so maybe a FAQ question about it?)

I don't mind if you want to change anything about my current model as well, I would love some thoughts about the pages I have planned.

I thought our infertility was going to be in the ""home stretch"" when I got my prolactinoma diagnosed and was put on medication for it. But we also tested my AMH and AFC, and they came back very low for my age. (I am 28, AMH was 0.88, and AFC saw 13, with 1 strongly dominant already at CD3. FSH has not been tested CD3). 

Very quickly, my RE jumped from the ""slow progression"" plan we had laid out in consult (natural a while more with cabergoline, then IUIs, then IVF) straight to recommending IVF ASAP, as they're not sure how quickly my AMH is falling, and how long I have left. 

Reading about AMH, it seems there's a lot of conflicting info/opinions on a- if it actually does change and b- if it has any bearing on natural conception cycles. 

When my AMH was tested, I had already been on CoQ10 Ubiquinol 200mg/day and alpha lipoic acid (I forget dose, 100mg?) and vit D for a few months. So I wonder if my AMH was already an ""improved"" number. 

Does the IVF recommendation seem reasonable? Should I seek a second opinion? (It might have to be a virtual consult, since my RE is the only one within a couple hundred miles). My IVF consult with my RE is on Feb 7th.

I promised a few people here I'd report back when I had more info to share. I've received the results of my second EFT in November after modifying my protocol. TLDR at the bottom.

Original results are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6ogp0v/i_just_got_a_little_less_unexplained_uterine/), but to summarize, this test includes two biopsies in a single cycle (CD15 and CD24), and there were two biochemical markers they check for that were off kilter - p27 and Cyclin E. The solution my doctor worked out with Dr. Kliman was two months of Depot Lupron to reset my lining, lower estrogen dosage, and a more gradual rampup in progesterone using micronized progesterone suppositories instead of PIO. 

The first one, p27, is checked the day after you start progesterone for an FET protocol (CD15). My original p27 was elevated and more consistent with CD17-18, which Dr. Kliman interpreted as my body having issues regulating estrogen due to low adipose tissue. We replaced IM delestrogen with vaginal estrace and my new results for that part of the test are normal. 

Also in the first test, Cyclin E was elevated on CD24, which isn't supposed to be present during the luteal phase, and indicated a ""marked"" level of glandular developmental arrest. My new biopsy showed lower levels of Cyclin E corresponding to ""mild"" glandular developmental arrest. (Think of it as a scale of 0-4, with 0 as the goal, and I went from a 3 to a 1). So better but still abnormal.

Also this time, they found macrophage cells in the sample, possibly suggesting endometriosis, low grade pelvic or uterine inflamation, excessive glandular secretions, or hydrosalpinx. My money is on endometriosis. 

My new protocol is three additional months of Depot Lupron (currently on month 2) and an even more gradual progesterone ramp up than last time. I'm trying to reach out to Dr. Kliman to ask him a few more questions directly. I plan to bring up the possibility of intralipid infusion in response to the macrophages and possible endo. Dr. Kliman and my RE agree that after these changes I can go straight into an FET rather than another biopsy. I'll have another FET at the end of March, almost exactly a year since my last FET.

You can tell from my username how naïve I was about getting pregnant when we started a year ago.  I started out immediately temping, using OPK's, and we had perfect timing each cycle.  I headed to the doc earlier than usual because I have to be off my meds for a painful muscular disorder, so I wanted to be aggressive in testing and treatment.

About me (TW: miscarriage): 30F with one CP and three MCs around 7-8 weeks with huge subchorionic hematoma preceding hemorrhagic miscarriages that I had to be hospitalized for. Trying for 18 months

Other factors that may determine my egg quality:
AMH - 3.9
FSH - don't remember exact lab but within normal range 
AFC - typically 25-35 follicles seen on US

- I respond well to meds
 
- karyotyping for husband and I was normal

-I ovulate normally between Day 14-19 in a 29-31 day cycle on my own. 

-I've gotten pregnant via IUI (due to my partner's low sperm count) three times. First D&C biopsied showed Turners. Last two were not tested. 

So my RE believes that despite all the signs pointing to 'good' eggs, when combined with husband's sperm the embryos are not good quality and suggests IVF with PGS. 

All my bloods have come back normal and anatomically my uterus (sono) looks fine with suspected mild adenomyosis (which is new to me, never had any symptoms)

My husband doesn't understand the desire and how much this hurts. And everyone else I know we don't really talk about things like this.

Currently, I feel like there's something lodged in my throat. I feel my heart racing and I'm clammy and sweaty. I'm struggling so badly tonight.

I miscarried 3 times. I have PCOS. Clomid didn't help. We make a good income. But due to past medical issues, we're severely in debt. Badly.

I was going to say we can afford a baby but not the treatment. But that's silly and not true. We can't afford a child. I'm running out of time due to PCOS and we can't get pregnant any way.

So I'm living with this knowledge that we won't be having kids. That's what I've lived for. I wanted to make our own family. Mine sucked. I wanted to be a great influence and understanding mom. I wanted to have a baby. A child. A teenager. 

I wanted to drink coffee with my baby when they were old enough. I wanted to make pancakes in the morning. I wanted...I just wanted a child.

We can't adopt. We can't have our own. And I'm dying. I can't breathe. I hardly feel anything anymore. 

I used to be very depressed. I got better. And now I'm not. I just can't get this knowledge out of my throat.

Im sorry but I hoped ithers would know this pain because I just don't know how to deal with this.

We're not married and have been dating for around 2 years.  I'm 36 and she is 37 (birthdays in August).

I'm still in shock about this.  I am nowhere close to being in a place where I am ready to have children.  At the same time it seems like the window for her to have children may be closing and that is terrifying.

This would be somewhat easier except that the relationship has also had problems - I would not say I am that happy.  It's not a bad relationship but there are definitely issues.

I'm struggling with what to do.  Her doctor told her that if she wants kids now would be the time to start trying.  It's very painful to think about what happens if I decide I just can't do this.

My name is Michael Lee, from Cellview Sciences. We are an early stage startup based out of the University of Pennsylvania trying to improve success rates and predictability for in vitro fertilization: https://mackinstitute.wharton.upenn.edu/2017/2017-2018-y-prize-finalists/

What we've developed is a new method for preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) that is faster, more accurate, and does not damage embryo cells with biopsies; it is our hope that this technology will change the lives of many aspiring parents by increasing their probability of success for each IVF cycle through rapid, accurate diagnoses and minimal embryo loss during the screening process.

In order to guide the development of our technology and ensure we are going in the right direction, we are looking to gather patient experiences (with mod approval) through a brief, anonymous online survey. We understand that this is a very sensitive topic, so all questions are completely optional.

Here is a link to the survey: https://wharton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0rN5YLkPlWlCGup

The responses will be used to support market research that will be presented to investors so we can bring our idea to life. In addition, we have partnered with researchers at the university as well as independent fertility clinics in the greater Philadelphia area to develop our product.

Thank you in advance for offering to tell your stories to improve IVF and PGS as a whole. If you have any more questions about who we are or what we do, ask away and I'll answer what I can in the comments.

Thank you!

A hycosy showed a blocked or spasmed right tube (later removed with the ectopic) but no other uterine abnormalities and 3D ultrasounds done for the ectopic showed a normal uterine cavity.  After the tube removal, I started IVF, had first cycle in September with a good response to stims, transferred one 5 day blast that didn't succeed, and got two 5 day blasts to freeze.  The only hitch with that cycle was that I had a persistent follicular cyst that required drainage and my estrogen was 600-700 prior to stims, so I was downregulated for a few extra weeks before stimming.   We haven't done PGD or had any ERAs/scratches, immune testing, fragmentation/genetics, and/or immune testing or any other add-ons.  I'm in the UK receiving treatment on the NHS, which I am grateful for, but there are fewer extras available to us at this point. 

Our WTF appointment in October was pretty useless, the consultant was patronising and didn't have much insight into why our cycle failed.  He said I responded well to the drugs so we should just do our FETs but be prepared for a full three collection cycles as that's how long it may take for success.  We were told our embryo was ""beautiful"" so he didn't know why it didn't take. I mentioned that I'd had some light periods after my miscarriage so he said to do a hysteroscopy to check for scarring.  However, he seemed surprised when I told him I hadn't had a D&C (and never had PID, STI, etc.) so not sure how I would have developed scarring.  When I queried this, he brushed it off and said it wouldn't hurt to do the procedure.  (I was a bit taken aback as it does require some cervical dilation, anaesthesia, etc., so to call it ""nothing"" seems a bit cavalier).  Also, my lining was fine and trilaminar on scans at our first cycle, and my periods have been generally pretty normal save for a small amount of spotting a day or two before/after (I reckon I wouldn't have even noticed this if I weren't on knicker watch every month).  When I queried these things, the consultant continued to fob me off and said it wouldn't hurt to do the hysteroscopy but didn't provide any justification.

I understand the hysteroscopy can find scar tissue and/or polyps that might be interfering with implantation and repair them, but I also believe that these things would have been detected on one of my many scans or hycosy, is that correct?  

Because of NHS waiting times, I won't have the hysteroscopy until at least April, which will be eight months after my first failed transfer!  It seems that I may be able to do a natural FET in February, and if it doesn't succeed, then I'm still in line to do the hysteroscopy in April.  And if it does succeed, well, then the hysteroscopy isn't necessary.  My husband is in favor of trying for a natural FET before the hysteroscopy, as am I.  But if we don't do the transfer in Feb, we would then be waiting until May/June after the scope, which would leave us in Sept 2018(ish) for another transfer if this one didn't take...and the next stim cycle not until I'm 37 in 2019. My AMH last Feb was 9, so I suppose that is also relevant.

It seems worthwhile to me to try with the next embryo now, as we both feel eager to just get on with it.  I also feel physically ready to go forward now and (pardon my non-scientific belief) but just feel like this is a good time to move forward, so I'm also feeling as emotionally ready as I can be.  I reckon I'd also thought the scope would be in Jan/Feb (as was originally told to us) so perhaps I'd mentally prepared for now to be our chance.  We would like to do our FETs before doing another stim cycle, but we are of course aware that might be a possibility down the road, so would like to get moving on it if that makes sense.

What are your thoughts?  Would you do the FET now or wait until after the hysteroscopy?  Can you provide any other insights or information?  

Many thanks and cheers to you all for your strength and wisdom.

**What happened in the last months?**

Well, after the loss of all our 4 embryos early in October I went back to my country of origin to catch up with some family and friends. I took a month to recover also in preparation for my PhD Viva. 

The time I spent with my friends was great it really helped me getting myself through the hurt and disappointment of the failure of our first cycle. 


The time I spent with my family was less relaxing, to use a euphemism. It soon became clear that my mum and my brother were not really supporting my choice to pursue IVF. It was a shower of bingos. I was in tears, I felt totally ambushed especially as my brother came over at my mom's place with the excuse to have lunch all together, but when he arrived they had me sit on the sofa and they started attacking me (yes there was a lot of shouting) like if they were doing an intervention against my obsession to become pregnant. 
Keep in mind it was less than 10 days since we lost our embryos and when I breached the subjected of possible egg donation (due to the low quality of my eggs) I was accused of not just wanting a baby, but a pregnancy. Apparently, they are mutually excluding each other in case of fertility problem (great logic, I know). 

I made the decision in that moment not to include them in any further information about what we are going or not going to do (I failed that resolution, but that's another story). 

Luckily, I also have a great uncle and aunt who struggled when they tried to conceive my cousin. It took them 12 years and they were more understanding; they offered support, understanding and a lot of love. (Yay, I also have decent relatives). 


When I came back to the UK we had an appointment with the OB/GYN consultant at the hospital and we were granted another cycle on the NHS, I suggested changing the protocol and she agreed it was the best shot we could give.
So short protocol, microflare still 450 Menopur but split between drugs, more details when I actually get my hands on the drugs.
We shall start in the next few days. I will update in the active treatment thread as things get into moving.

**Plan b?**
We also had the first appointment with the hospital counsellor to discuss egg donation.  Mr Wonky is the cautious type, so he didn't want to discuss any other option ahead of time, but I felt the need to know what was available and where we stand from a legal standpoint if this cycle fails too.  In the UK children conceived from donors have the right at the age of 18 to know the identity of the donor. This terrified me, but the counsellor was really helpful and I now don't feel threatened about this eventuality if this is the path we will decide to take. 

It also felt good to have Mr Wonky listen to what were my ideas, hopes and worries in front of a counsellor. I felt free to express every upsetting thought I had on the matter. 
I came home with a lot of food for thoughts. 

**What now?**
While I wait for my period to start, I am still waiting on my Viva report containing the minor corrections that the University wants me to add to my thesis and I also started working a little more full time as a translator (self-employed is my new 2018 project - yay!). 

I am not feeling emotionally excited about this second cycle approaching. I think I am more realistic about what it entails and I am also protecting my little self from disappointment. I am sure once I will be in it I will feel better. Surely, I will feel happier because I will be able to eat normally again (at our mid-December consent appointment I was reminded I had a BMI restriction to access my second cycle, so I spent the holiday season dieting to lose the 6 pounds that I gained in the last 6 months).

I am back, for better or for worse. I know many familiar names have moved on, some are still here at different stages of their journey and many new people have arrived in this forum since I took my break.

303,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Just looking to see if this community has any pointers here.  This is probably more of a rant than anything else..

We're awaiting CD1 to see if we're a go next cycle and we're running into what's become something of a frustratingly familiar problem.

From the get-go we've known that we'd need assistance conceiving, since we always knew we'd have to use donor sperm.  But it seems that every time we get the go-ahead for a cycle, we're scrambling around trying to choose a donor who can be shipped to the clinic in time. 

Being that we're in Canada, and donors here cannot be paid for samples, there is a much more limited market of samples to choose from.  The way that it works, at least as far as I understand it, is that there are a couple of ""cyro-brokers"" that import donor samples from the US and sell them here in Canada.  

There seem to be some Health Canada screening guidelines that significantly cut down on US donor catalogs.  This, coupled with needing to rely on the brokers to have a given donor in stock, is making it challenging for us to have a sample chosen, ordered, purchased, and shipped to our clinic in the short window between CD2/3 testing that confirms we're a go, and CD9/10 when I could potentially ovulate.

Of course, we could always have gone ahead and purchased multiple vials of our preferred donors to keep at the ready, but obviously no-one can predict exactly how many vials we'll need to be successful, so it's kind of a crapshoot, plus the cyrobanks charge a not-insignificant amount to store the samples for any length of time.  On top of this, if we had been lucky enough to be successful on the first try, they will only buy back samples at 50% of the original cost, which really is a bunch of BS.

So our decision has been to order samples as we need them, which means we're limited to whatever stock the cyrobank happens to have on the shelf at the time. 
 We're not incredibly restrictive with our donors, I think we have a fairly decent short list of 5 or 6 candidates that we'd be comfortable using, but every time we get the go ahead to order, it seems like at least a couple of them are not available.  Last cycle, Mr. Friend ended up ordering a vial from each of the brokers to make sure we had the samples we needed for our back-to-back IUIs, since both brokers were down to 1 left of this particular donor... and this was after 3 of our other candidates were out-of-stock.

I guess I'm just frustrated that the system here doesn't seem to be meeting demand if they're out of stock so often.  I'm also frustrated that the cyrobanks seem to be taking every opportunity to capitalize off of people in really shitty situations.  It was hard enough for Mr. Friend and I to come to the decision to use donor sperm, and thoughtfully selecting donors was a process that we worked through together.  It's unnerving to have to keep making snap decisions at the last minute when it's time to go.

Here is a place you can vent, make fun of your sisters, whatever you need to feel better.

I'll start this by saying my sister has been a wall of ice since I started IVF. When I told her I was planning to start the process, she tersely said ""I don't know what to say"" repeatedly, so I sent her the Resolve info for friends and family info and she ignored it. We've barely spoken since. She wasn't like this during my IUIs. We used to have a close, warm relationship, so this smarts. I got a smiley face in response to my text that one embryo made it. That hurt and offended me a lot. I got one call, a perfunctory Christmas call that lasted 5 minutes and she didn't let me say anything. She talked so fast about her holiday, never asking about mine, and very firmly wished me a merry Christmas like she didn't want to hear a word out of me and wanted to get me off the phone ASAP. She knew I had my FET yesterday and nothing. This all hurts a lot, especially as I supported her through decades of chronic illness and other problems, always with all the warmth and kindness (and sometimes cash) I could. It's just been worse and worse since her daughter, who I adore, started school. My sister has acted more and more like people who don't have children have very easy, charmed lives - knowing our struggle of years of IF. No matter what, she has the hardest life and other people's problems are not serious. It's really sad, actually, if she's defining herself that way and can't empathize with others any more. Also, I now have chronic illness too, so she doesn't have that ""title"" all to herself any more - even though she is the only family member who knows of both my illness and IF. She seems define herself as a sick person and as a mom. I guess that's so much of her identity it could feel like I'm threatening it by being in an intense medical treatment to have a baby. It's hard to understand all this. I am not initiating any contact with my sister any time soon and am determined to somehow have a civil relationship so I can maintain access to my niece.

Any mathematicians out there?) that factors in all of your fertility stats and then your treatments and gives you a percentage chance of success each cycle. I found this one https://www.sartcorsonline.com/Predictor/Patient but it only gives you your % chance of success with IVF. I'm sure a bunch of us would love to be able to compare chances of success with IVF vs naturally vs other treatments. Or to be able to compare what each of our fertility factors does to change our percentage. For example if I have x (pcos) and y(a tube blocked), if I fix y, how have my chances improved? Then if I have x but try z (clomid) to improve my chances, how does that change my success rate? I can only speak for myself here, but I think it would help me be more patient each cycle (like i may only have a  2% chance naturally right now...why get my hopes up) and to better prioritize where to focus my treatment energies.  I'm wishing right now I had been a better math student. Does such a thorough multi-factor calculator already exist?

Any mathematicians out there?) that factors in all of your fertility stats and then your treatments and gives you a percentage chance of success each cycle. I found this one <a href=""https://www.sartcorsonline.com/Predictor/Patient"">https://www.sartcorsonline.com/Predictor/Patient</a> but it only gives you your % chance of success with IVF. I&#39;m sure a bunch of us would love to be able to compare chances of success with IVF vs naturally vs other treatments. Or to be able to compare what each of our fertility factors does to change our percentage. For example if I have x (pcos) and y(a tube blocked), if I fix y, how have my chances improved? Then if I have x but try z (clomid) to improve my chances, how does that change my success rate? I can only speak for myself here, but I think it would help me be more patient each cycle (like i may only have a  2% chance naturally right now...why get my hopes up) and to better prioritize where to focus my treatment energies.  I&#39;m wishing right now I had been a better math student. Does such a thorough multi-factor calculator already exist? </p>

Looking for your experiences with a saline sonohysterogram. My wife had this done on Friday and was crampy and in a fair amount of intermittent pain all weekend. (TMI: She had a bit of bleeding, but today it is still bleeding every time she urinates. Not much but maybe a bit more than the weekend) She put in a call to the nurse, but she is traveling and we can't get to a doctor until she is home. 

Any one else have this done? Is this normal?
