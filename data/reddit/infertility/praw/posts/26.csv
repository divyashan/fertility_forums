The article above essentially states how I feel on a daily basis. I found out I might have trouble conceiving in November of 2014. That is also when I got engaged.

In 2015 I ended a friendship because one of my closer friends told me I didn't understand what it was like to have kids. I didn't know tired. I didn't know love. These were all incredibly insulting statements to me. This article hit home for several reasons; mostly because these things are said to me on a regular basis by people who have been fortunate enough to have children. In the last two years, I have learned that becoming a parent is a privilege, not a right. It does not make your time any more valuable. It does not make your ability to love inferior to a parent’s. It does not mean you lack in empathy or sympathy. It doesn’t mean you can’t be tired because you have chosen to work on your career first. Becoming a parent doesn’t end your life. It doesn’t mean you don’t understand what it is like to be responsible for someone else. And it definitely doesn’t mean you lack compassion. I am constantly made to feel like it is a contest of who is more of something when parents are involved. To state that those without children whether they choose not to have them or can’t, are incapable of any of the above is nothing more than a dig or an insult. 

I have severe endo, a collapsed fallopian tube and am at an age where if I am fortunate enough to conceive, my pregnancy will called geriatric. I feel dehumanized. I am awaiting surgery to correct the endo which I find out about in a week. But I am learning just how fragile I am.

Lately it seems when anyone says anything baby related, I break down. Just the other day someone commented that I am so lucky I don't have kids because I must have so much freedom. I hear several versions of this and of course the above.

I am well aware that for some this is an incredibly heated topic. That many won't agree with me. And I am not seeking sympathy – in fact most times when I tell someone about my troubles I often get the look. That look that says I feel really sorry for you – it just makes you feel worse. I am just so tired of hearing that as a non-parent I don’t understand, that I don’t know what it is like to be tired, that I don’t know what it is like to have no time, or that I don’t know what real love is. I want to remind these people that they were lucky enough to have kids, but I don't.

I am just trying to find a way to cope with all this. Any advice would be great. I am just trying to find my way through and am starting to drown.

<p>The article above essentially states how I feel on a daily basis. I found out I might have trouble conceiving in November of 2014. That is also when I got engaged.</p>

<p>In 2015 I ended a friendship because one of my closer friends told me I didn&#39;t understand what it was like to have kids. I didn&#39;t know tired. I didn&#39;t know love. These were all incredibly insulting statements to me. This article hit home for several reasons; mostly because these things are said to me on a regular basis by people who have been fortunate enough to have children. In the last two years, I have learned that becoming a parent is a privilege, not a right. It does not make your time any more valuable. It does not make your ability to love inferior to a parent’s. It does not mean you lack in empathy or sympathy. It doesn’t mean you can’t be tired because you have chosen to work on your career first. Becoming a parent doesn’t end your life. It doesn’t mean you don’t understand what it is like to be responsible for someone else. And it definitely doesn’t mean you lack compassion. I am constantly made to feel like it is a contest of who is more of something when parents are involved. To state that those without children whether they choose not to have them or can’t, are incapable of any of the above is nothing more than a dig or an insult. </p>

I was so sure that last cycle was the one; husband&#39;s count was awesome, timing of sex before and after trigger shot and IUI was perfect, I had a super healthy 2ww and nada. </p>

<p>When I went for my follicle study on Tuesday my uterine lining was a 12! It&#39;s normally between 6-8 and I have two perfect follicles on the right that are <em>exactly the same size</em>!!! My sweet nurse said she was putting &quot;juju&quot; on my trigger shot before handing it over to me.</p>

<p>So obviously I&#39;m excited and hopeful for this cycle. And I am being super positive, when ever I catch myself thinking &quot;well, if I get pregnant this cycle....&quot; I stop myself and rephrase to &quot;well, I will be pregnant this cycle so...&quot;
Any well wishes, wisdom, tips or tricks would be appreciated! Here&#39;s to lucky cycle 25!</p>

I have no idea about what my FET protocol will be. Hopefully I'll find out more about that by the end of the week because we are planning on starting it this next cycle. 

I have tried looking into it some, but the protocols all seem so different. Here's my basic understand so someone please correct me where I'm confused. It seems to me like there are 2 basic ways to go about preparing your uterus to be receptive to an embryo transfer. One is making your body actually ovulate and then transfering sometime after ovulation when your body would be expecting a fertilized embryo to be around. The other seems to be not actually ovulating or triggering but giving yourself hormones (estrogen then progesterone) to mimic the hormones during a normal cycle and ""trick"" your body and uterus into thinking you ovulated and are now in a luteal phase then transfering the embryo. Is that kind of the basics or am I misinformed?

After our first cycle in April, our clinic made us sit out May so we did a more detailed SA that month to look at my husband's morphology. It was bad (1.5% normal), so decided not to go ahead with an IUI in June because we wanted to think about whether that made sense or if we should move to IVF. We tried on our own, but didn't use OPK's or temp and I thought we didn't time things well because I had a relative staying at our house. 

I took two early home pregnancy tests at CD26 and 29 of my 28 day cycle and both were negative. By CD33 when I still hadn't gotten my period I took another test and it was positive. I went and got blood work done that day and the next day (our anniversary) we were told I was technically pregnant but the hCG was low (51) and it could go either way. I did blood work again the next day and it doubled to 106. The clinic didn't request I come in for a third beta, they just booked an 8 week ultrasound.

Late Monday night at 5w5d, I discovered brown blood when I went to the bathroom. I freaked out and made my husband take me to the emergency room. We waited until we realized that we would not be seen until our clinic opened in the morning and that the ER would send us for an outpatient ultrasound instead of doing it there. So we got in touch with the clinic first thing and they only asked for me to come in for blood work (no ultrasound or pelvic exam). My beta was 150, so it barely rose in 6 days. I was told it is not viable and to come in again Thursday to repeat the blood work to see that my hCG is going down appropriately. If not, they might do an ultrasound.

Right now I am so scared that it's ectopic and really upset I can't get an ultrasound sooner. So far I am only having light brown bleeding. From what I've read, most early miscarriages are like a heavy period and this is way lighter than a normal period. Between that, the late positive test, the low betas, I feel like other than not having pain it seems like it could be ectopic. If the pain starts once the tube is at risk of rupture, why won't they do an ultrasound before that point to hopefully catch it earlier? 

I'm devastated my hope got taken away so quickly and now I'm facing my worst case scenario of a possible ectopic pregnancy. The last week has been such a rollercoaster and I just want some clarity on what's going on. I was thinking of going into a walk-in clinic to request some sort of medication to calm me down, and perhaps get some reassurance about whether this is ectopic. 

Any advice on how to get through the next day and week? Is it normal for a clinic to not do an ultrasound in this case? Even if it's not ectopic I don't seem to be passing enough tissue for this to complete naturally.

Here is the basic history:

Came off BC in 2009 - Didn't actively try, but honestly weren't 100% careful every time. Honestly thought there would be a ""whoops!"" pregnancy (silly me).

Started Actively TTC Jan 2014 - Actively using OPKs, really making sure my Period Tracker App was up to date, etc. etc... nothing

Doctors appts started in July of 2015 - After a HSG found out left side was blocked - they tried to unblock during procedure (that was fun) to no avail.

Insurance I was on did not cover infertility. Needed to get new insurance which would start at the beginning of the new year.

Jan-March 2016 - Drs appointments to determine a protocol. Honestly I thought I was going straight to IVF, they did too. Insurance was like HAHAHAHA yeah we cover it, but we need you to do three IUIs first. 

IUI #1 - No trigger shot was given after 5 days of Clomid, determined dominate follicle was on left side which is blocked. Told me to just try myself anyways in case. Obviously negative. Bonus: Accidentally called me to say we were good to go on the IUI and trigger, called back 5 mins later to say, whoops our bad, it was on the wrong side.

IUI #2 - Follicle on both sides, bigger of the two on the right! Trigger shot, IUI, sex before and after. Period NINE DAYS LATE - Negative bloodwork and got my period after driving 1.25 hrs back and forth to the drs. that morning. Bonus: It was my birthday.

<Month off - cysts on ovaries>

IUI #3 - Two follicles on both sides. Better of the bunch on the right side. Trigger shot, IUI, sex before and after. Period seven days late, along with negative blood test. I could tell though. Was bummed b/c man those odds looked good, yet again, not surprised.

Moving on to IVF now. Had to take a month off because of insurance needing all my labs done again b/c it had been a year. 8 vials of blood later... Then went in for the consult last Friday and a saline U/S...fyi nowhere near as bad as the HSG. Found out insurance denied request to start IVF this month b/c my Estradiol was 4 points more than they wanted it to be, even though still in the normal range and my Dr. argued and said that was bullshit. 

So here's where my stupid hopefulness comes in...

During the saline U/S I asked her to check my ovaries b/c they felt full and I wanted to make sure I didn't have to delay things to have yet another U/S to see if it was a cyst again. She saw two great looking follicles, both on right side. So of course I went out and spent $28 on OPKs (I know I can get the dollar store ones, but honestly I never buy them at this point, I figured I'd splurge and get the one with the damn stick!) and I've been timing and doing everything I can this week. I had a goddamn breakdown during the IVF consult when they were discussing all the meds and the shots and the U/S, I was just like... why is this like this? Why is this so f'n hard?!? But at the same time, part of me knows this is going to be a bust too and to not get my hopes up.

We had a rough time when we were younger, but we've been very close since I was about 16 and she was 13. She and my mom both get the nitty gritty details of everything that's going on with me, but my mom really just listens. My sister offers support.

She had her son in December 2014. We decided to start trying soon before he was born. She was planning on waiting until he was 18 months then starting to try again. I figured I'd be dealing with a newborn at that point.

Well you guys know how that goes.

She decided she wanted a May baby this time. I've wanted a May baby since high school. I even got my high school class ring with an emerald to try to give myself future May baby vibes. My mom's class ring had my birthstone. I know it's stupid, but it's what I've always wanted. I mean, obviously I'll take a baby whenever, but I really wanted a May one. She decided that since she got pregnant the first time she had unprotected sex with her husband, she's going to start trying in August. She got her Mirena out today.

I know how this is going to end. I'll be ending this stupid annovulatory cycle in 10-14 days. I'll be ovulating in early August. She probably will around then too. She says she believes we'll both get pregnant at the same time, but I know better. I'll fail on my last Clomid cycle and she'll succeed the first time she has sex and she'll have two beautiful fucking babies and I'll be childless. 

It doesn't help that my mom (who I love, but we've had a very very tumultuous relationship) says she hopes we're *not* pregnant at the same time because she won't know who to support at birth since we're in different states. My sister told her that of course she'd be supporting me. Sis will be having her second. She knows the drill. My mom still seemed torn about it.

Our WTF from the cancelled cycle was today. We got our new protocol and talked about some of my concerns. The last time I took Clomid was with my OB/GYN in early 2015. It did nothing but give me 4 massive cysts and put me out of the baby-making game for 3 months. 

My RE decided to use Clomid again saying that any cysts would be drained during egg retrieval. Since we never made it to egg retrieval (cancelling due to a dominant follicle), I was worried about cysts. I brought this up today so we did an ultrasound to check. 

YEP! I was right! I have 5 cysts this time! The four on my left ovary are all about 4 cm. Not sure about the one on the right. I forgot to listen to the RE as my husband was gushing over how big they looked on the screen. 

I don't know whether I should be mad, sad, or numb. I'm just not sure how to feel right now. My next protocol includes testosterone and estrogen priming with prometrium capsules towards the end. My RE thought it best to continue with the protocol since it is a 2-cycle plan. If our baseline shows that the cysts are still there, we will stop everything and wait until they go away. If the u/s shows that the cysts are gone, we will continue on as planned. Which would be great because we haven't lost any time. 

I'm nervous about this testosterone gel and patch. And I'm so not looking forward to putting capsules in my vagina. Today wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be. Thanks for letting me vent.

54,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Edited to add:  Or should I look into having it drained instead? 

So my IVF doctor can't start stims and IVF on us until the small cyst on my ovary is resolved. He wanted to do surgery right away, but I wanted to wait to see if it would go away.  It has been six weeks and still appears to be there. It isn't growing, but isn't shrinking, and he does not think it is fluid filled (in which case it won't go away), but it is dark on the scans so it could be?  I'm convinced it is from my stims from my IUIs last fall (or at least from around March when I started having wierd pain).  

Has anyone had a laparoscopy?  My doctor says they don't normally do operations to remove them unless they are over 5cm,  but he does in situations like mine since time is of the essence.  

Also, how long is recovery really? He suggested taking one day off work, but I want a weekend to recover so going to try for a Friday surgery.  How much pain were you in?  How long with no sex or physical activity?  What was your experience? 

I'm wary of any more invasive approach, but I also want to get started already and he has said that even after surgery we need to wait two months for stimm.

<p>So my IVF doctor can&#39;t start stims and IVF on us until the small cyst on my ovary is resolved. He wanted to do surgery right away, but I wanted to wait to see if it would go away.  It has been six weeks and still appears to be there. It isn&#39;t growing, but isn&#39;t shrinking, and he does not think it is fluid filled (in which case it won&#39;t go away), but it is dark on the scans so it could be?  I&#39;m convinced it is from my stims from my IUIs last fall (or at least from around March when I started having wierd pain).  </p>

<p>Has anyone had a laparoscopy?  My doctor says they don&#39;t normally do operations to remove them unless they are over 5cm,  but he does in situations like mine since time is of the essence.  </p>

<p>Also, how long is recovery really? He suggested taking one day off work, but I want a weekend to recover so going to try for a Friday surgery.  How much pain were you in?  How long with no sex or physical activity?  What was your experience? </p>

<p>I&#39;m wary of any more invasive approach, but I also want to get started already and he has said that even after surgery we need to wait two months for stimm. </p>

58,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey guys, 
A little intro: 33/F, partner is 33/M.  We've had a sperm analysis and his side of things all looks perfect.  On paper, my side of things looks near-perfect as well, but we've been actively trying for about 1.5 years. 

In January '16 I had an HSG (which fucking sucked hardcore) but got pregnant that same cycle, without any meds or other procedures. During the HSG, there was a slight delay in the dye going through my left tube, so the thought is that the dye forced the tube open, allowing me to get pregnant. Unfortunately I miscarried in March and had a D&C. After that I has an SHG which came back normal with the exception of a small fibroid.

I have had symptoms of endo since puberty (painful cramping, heavy periods) but haven't been officially diagnosed. I scheduled a laparoscopy / hysteroscopy after talking with my nurse at the fertility clinic - she downplayed it, said I could have the lap on a Friday and be back to work by Monday, no big deal, recovery time is sooo minimal, blah blah blah. Well, I just got back from my pre-op meeting with a different nurse, and I'm starting to realize how big of a deal this actually is.  I have to be on birth control pills for 3 weeks beforehand (so, one month gone from TTC), then they told me to take at least a full week off of work, and they're putting me on estrogen (Estrace) twice daily for ""at least"" a month post-surgery (so, 2, potentially 3 months gone from TTC). This is theoretically to ""help my uterus heal"" (although that wasn't needed after my D&C for whatever reason).

We'd been hesitant on moving forward with IVF because of all the hormones and time involved (I know I don't respond well to hormones, had terrible day-ruining reactions to every form of birth control back before we started trying). I originally chose the lap because it seemed like the easier, less-invasive, less time-consuming, less hormonal choice. Two days off work! Friday to Monday, bam, done! Back to trying!

Now I'm realizing the lap is still like a 2-3 month commitment (including both pre-op and post-op), I still will have to take hormones, I'll be fucking intubated and catheterized and whatever else and there's obviously no guarantee that it will help anyway. 

I'm wondering if I should cancel the surgery and just move forward with IVF - if I have to go through 2-3 months of hormones and invasive shit anyway, I may as well choose the 2-3 months of hormonal invasive shit that gives us higher chances, right? And the one that's not like major abdominal surgery with a week of healing time?

Feeling really really sad and frustrated.  Nothing is easy.  I just want something - some choice, some procedure, some option - to be not fucking painful. But tbh it all fucking sucks right now.

What would you do, if you were in my shoes? To lap or not to lap? Did you have estrogen after your lap?  What were the side effects like? Did you have to do something else (IVF, IUI, etc) after your lap anyway in order to get pregnant, or was that the one trick that did it for any of you?

Thanks for letting me vent, having a super hard day. Any advice is appreciated.

I'm hoping you guys won't mind if I ask some really basic questions as I look into the initial steps I am going to have to take to get pregnant.

Basically, I have had normal cycles all my life, but about a year and a half ago, my period began to get further and further apart before stopping altogether. (I was not on birth control during any of this time period.) For a while, my ob-gyn didn't seem concerned at all, but now that my period has been well and truly gone for over a year with no sign of returning, she finally decided to take me seriously. 

First, I was given provera, which did not result in any kind of bleed. Then, they started running other tests. So far, I have had several blood tests that have ruled out POF, high prolactin, and thyroid problems as possible causes for my amenorrhea and am going for an ultrasound tomorrow to see if a cyst could be causing it. The doctor has also ordered another blood test to see if I have any sort of specific hormone imbalance.

So that was a lot of text for a relatively simple question: how am I supposed to get pregnant with no period if even the provera can't cause a bleed? From what I've been reading, I can't just be prescribed clomid or something without having an initial bleed. Am I already in the realm of more expensive treatments?

Background: TTC 13 months. 30F, 29M. Irregular-ish cycles (but definitively not PCOS) for her. HSG good. AMH: 5.1, AFC: 26. Testosterone, thyroid, FSH/LH all good. Dr’s current theory on irregular cycles is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, and maybe low Vitamin D, either way, unconcerned with female factor. I did have 10 cycles in 12 months, with good luteal phase lengths. 

SA: Consistently 2% morphology (amorphous heads). Everything else good. Good count, motility, concentration, etc: smack in the normal range. Ultrasound of testicles was fine, no varicoceles. 

Dr. is recommending 2-3 rounds of IUI starting with 25mg clomid + ovadril + prometrium. He’s giving each round a 12-15% success rate. His reasoning is since we’re young, why not try less invasive and lower cost interventions and hope to get lucky. 

That was a bit of a curveball, because we were assuming we’d be going straight to IVF+ICSI given the shit odds of 2% morphology. We were really in a grim mood the last two weeks to be honest. Period starting yesterday doesn’t help things. 

I’m happy to try IUI, seems less scary than IVF. Obviously would have like to have been pregnant a year ago, but 3 months doesn’t make that much difference. We could still get one IVF in 2016 for deductible/OOP limits. 

Here’s what I’m not sure about. I have insurance coverage for fertility treatments. (Don’t hate me). I also don’t particularly like my job, and would have moved on a year ago, but I also get great maternity leave (for an American). And now I feel stuck to even get that pregnancy in the first place. For fertility treatments, it’s a $50k lifetime benefit max (with 50% co-pay, and drug coverage). And maternity leave is 3 months at full pay, so it’s not like I can go get a 25% salary + $50k raise at a new job anyhow. 

I’m expecting a call from the finance guy, but my back of the envelope costs of one IUI is about $800-$1000 out of pocket, with $800-$1000 coming from the lifetime benefit. So spending $3k, in an attempt to avoid a $6-9k IVF round sounds good to me. What doesn’t sound so good is wasting all this time. 

Also annoying. Chickenpox. Turns out I never got it as a kid (thanks random hives for faking us out). Turns out the vaccine I got 2 years ago wasn’t effective either. I got one last month, but the policy is 2 shots, 30 days apart, plus 30 days before treatment. I got a titre drawn Friday, and if I’m immune I’ll just sign the waiver. 

On top of all this, I haven't gotten insurance preauthorization yet. I don't want to start this without it. Maybe we should just wait a month. When I'm in a good mood, I can say sure, waiting is reasonable, in the grand scheme of things a month is nothing. In my bad moods it's like willingly adding time to a prison sentence. 

Need to make a decision by 7am tomorrow morning.

If Infertility Were a Broken Arm:
1) Just relax and your arm will heal itself.

2) Have you tried any vitamins or organic foods to help your arm not be broken?

3) Maybe you should just consider getting a bionic arm, since this broken one isn't working correctly.

4) It must have been God's will for you to break your arm.

5) You arm will heal in God's time, no need to take any action in assisting it to do so.

6) Maybe you just weren't using your arm right. That's why it broke.

7) Are you sure you know how to use your arm?

8) Why are you taking pain pills and wearing a cast? Do you really want to put your body through that? *OR* Why did you break your arm? You shouldn't put your body through something like that.

9) My brother's mother's friend's aunt broke her arm a couple of months ago and now she has a new one!

10) If you just think about your bone healing, it will happen. You just have to will it not to be broken anymore.

<p>Anyone have any perspective on balancing relationship issues against a ticking clock and IVF?  In case it helps, I was diagnosed with low AMH indicating low ovarian reserves. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

Heck, I was ready to jump to donor eggs when our first cycle was cancelled.   Can some men explain it to me like I&#39;m 5?  I understand the complications when it comes to adoption, when you have birth parents who may want some level of involvement, but that&#39;s not the situation with a donor, so why is the DNA connection so important?  Am I odd that I just don&#39;t feel the need for it?</p>

118,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Reading this subreddit has been very helpful to me, and today seemed the right day to join Reddit and offer my own different-but-the-same tale of woe. 32, very much unexplained. Three failed Clomid IUIs, then a ""natural"" cycle with confirmed ovulation but again, nothing. At the no-longer-counting-coffees stage of the process.

I was put on Puregon injectables (75) for another IUI, but over-responded, so cycle was cancelled. This much seemed clear enough - they want to avoid octuplets, as do I! So after 6 days (of what would have been 10) I stopped the shots as advised. 

But then things got strange. Day 15, spotting. I figured this was just hormones being odd and didn't think much of it. Day 16 (and now, 17): something resembling a period, but without cramps. My cycle is normally on the long side if anything. Went in for the usual bloodwork and ultrasound and... I have my period *and* still have a bunch (5ish?) of cysts, ready-to-ovulate-sized but apparently inactive. And exactly the mood one would expect from a mid-cycle period.

From my meeting with a nurse, it sounded as if all I needed to do was wait until my next period (in a month... maybe?) and start over on this allegedly useful medication (but a lower dose). But then when the same nurse called to give instructions on how to proceed, I mentioned offhand having Googled (!) that sometimes these cysts don't go away and she tells me yes, there's that, and actually they have no idea if they will, or what comes next.

I now have no idea a) if I'm somehow now permanently infertile (what are these cysts??), or b) if, if my partner and I have sex before my next period, if I'm inviting octuplets, something I really do wish I'd have thought to ask, but the whole having to get back to work thing got in the way.

Three failed Clomid IUIs, then a &quot;natural&quot; cycle with confirmed ovulation but again, nothing. At the no-longer-counting-coffees stage of the process.</p>

<p>I was put on Puregon injectables (75) for another IUI, but over-responded, so cycle was cancelled. This much seemed clear enough - they want to avoid octuplets, as do I! So after 6 days (of what would have been 10) I stopped the shots as advised. </p>

<p>But then things got strange. Day 15, spotting. I figured this was just hormones being odd and didn&#39;t think much of it. Day 16 (and now, 17): something resembling a period, but without cramps. My cycle is normally on the long side if anything. Went in for the usual bloodwork and ultrasound and... I have my period <em>and</em> still have a bunch (5ish?) of cysts, ready-to-ovulate-sized but apparently inactive. And exactly the mood one would expect from a mid-cycle period.</p>

<p>From my meeting with a nurse, it sounded as if all I needed to do was wait until my next period (in a month... maybe?) and start over on this allegedly useful medication (but a lower dose). But then when the same nurse called to give instructions on how to proceed, I mentioned offhand having Googled (!) that sometimes these cysts don&#39;t go away and she tells me yes, there&#39;s that, and actually they have no idea if they will, or what comes next. I <em>had not known</em> this was a possible side effect of this medication, and given that I was ovulating normally already, would probably have not done this and just waited to try IVF if I had. </p>

Normally this would upset me...but I am DYING to talk to her

We hadn't had our tests yet, I wasn't yet aboard the infertile train too, and I didn't understand what she was saying.... but I now realise she meant TESE. So no sperm in the count. It didn't work; and they got a dog. 

Now 2 years later she's pregnant and I'm experiencing the same MFI journey. I wish I could ask her what happened - what did they go for in the end? no one else I know has had any issues. Should I? Or should I just wait for her to share if she ever does? 

Second problem is we are ALWAYS in a gaggle of girls the rest of whom are 'easy breeders' (as I like to call them in my dark moments) so i think she generally kept it to herself as thought she was the only one having problems

I had my post op appointment with my Dr today and the good news is that I'm healing nicely (4 weeks post left tubal ligation for hydrosalpinx). Basically she said that obviously my one tube was shit and thats why they clipped and filleted it. However the other one was open, but had some scar tissue on it. She more or less said she can't say for certain if it's functioning or not. Therefore to try for a year and get back to her if we aren't pregnant. I can't imagine doing this limbo for another year. She eventually said, ""ok maybe 6 months, but if you want we could just start IVF now.""

I wasn't planning on using this dr for IVF anyway, and the other dr is ready to go with suppression starting next week (predicted CD1). I've already got the BC and metformin filled. The second Dr has all my records, but I've noticed they tend to only get the notes and not the images. So I'm pretty sure they just read the first dr's note that there was scar tissue and thus determined it's not worth it to try anything but IVF. Husband says he's fine with whatever I want to do, which is great because I've been the one pushing IVF ASAP and thought he wasn't totally on board. Here's the concerns/issues.

Even though we've been trying for 13 months, I didn't ovulate for 8 months post BC, so we've only had 5 cycles with good timing. Insurrance doesn't cover anything so it's going to be $16,000+meds (estimate of $5,000). I'm not a gambler so I'm torn between being scared shitless of spending $21,000 and finding out later we didn't need it and not spending the money and frittering time away while my egg quality declines. I'll be 30 in October and cut off from being an egg donor, so I feel pressure to get them out of me before then (like if they aren't good enough from other people then they must not be good at all or something). I've also convinced myself that if we ever conceive it will be ectopic, so that's a huge concern too. Not totally unfounded since the tube function is seriously questionable.

Just not sure if we should pull the trigger on IVF or wait it out a little longer. What would you do if you were me? Obviously I'll have to decide with my husband, but we've got less than a week to figure it out for this cycle or wait another whole cycle (35-50 days) so all input is welcome food for thought!

I have never been pregnant and I have been struggling with why it's so hard for me to talk to both of them. 

I realized a lot of it has to do with identity. They are already parents and while they may want children as badly as I do, their identity will not change if fertility treatments fail or succeed.

I am happy now without a child. I have friends and hobbies and a great job and great teen step kids and a wonderful husband. But I don't know what I'll do if I am not who I thought I'd be- if I'm never a mother. It seems like I have to totally redo my self identity and that's scary. My husband will never understand that.

I have spent the last few years firstly deciding to, and then actively trying to, have a baby. I'm single and I don't ever see myself in a long-term relationship / marriage. I didn't want my complete disaster of a love life to deprive me of motherhood, so I made the hardest decision of my life to try and have a baby on my own. 

Fast-forward to relentless months of the hell that is fertility treatment and failure after failure. I decided to have one last attempt before a break - and then it 'worked'; I was pregnant! I thought it was 'meant to be'; my gutsy decision to do it on my own was the right one. But a few short weeks later it all ended, and with that miscarriage, it feels all my hopes and dreams for the future have too.

Everyone thinks once I get over the miscarriage, I will go back and subject myself to more hellish fertility treatment, only to risk all of this happening again. I was only doing donor IUI, so I hadn't even progressed to IVF yet. But I honestly don't think I ever want to try anything ever again. 

Does it mean I don't want a baby 'enough' if I'm not willing to go through whatever it takes? I know women who have been through countless miscarriages, even still births, and years of IVF, who won't give up until they hold a live baby in their arms. And they all say that every part of the terrible process is worth it once they have the longed-for baby. 

So why can't I see that? Why am I so selfishly caught up in what I don't want to go through that I'm risking never being a mother? I thought I'd be a wonderful mother but now I feel so selfish and gutless, ready to give up after 'only' one miscarriage (that has pretty much broken me) and having never even tried IVF.

I want to introduce myself (27F) and tell my infertility story of trying to conceive with my husband (30M).  I'm a long time lurker.


Last year after trying for more about three years we went to an RE who ran some tests on us.  


My HSG showed that my right tube could be blocked but due to the dye stopping at the place the tube meets the uterus and me feeling an intense cramp on that side, the RE declared it was probably a spasm and that the tube might be open.  He also off-handedly mentioned that I have a chocolate cyst on my right ovary during an ultrasound and something about poly-cystic ovaries being possible, I think because my left ovary had many follicles pre-ovulation but I'm not sure.


My husband's SA came back with very rough numbers.  14mil, 15% motility and 0% morphology.  The RE said that my husband's morphology meant IVF with ICSI was our best bet.  This was devastating news but he said that I am young so we have time.  We weren't ready to go down this road yet last year.


He brushed off my issues as not the real problem and I can sort of understand that, but I wish he would have mentioned the fact that a chocolate cyst means I have Endometreosis.  I learned this online only recently.  Now I can't help but wonder if my fertility is rapidly declining due to Endo.  I wonder if my right tube really is damaged.


Do you think that me having an accurate endo diagnosis will be important for us going into IVF?  I've been experiencing more pelvic pain lately and wonder if I should seek treatment.  Should I rush toward IVF?


All of this insanity is compounded by the fact that I found out recently that my MIL (who is someone I am close to) smoked while pregnant with my husband.  I read a study that concluded (in mice) that pregnant females gave birth to male offspring with reduced sperm parameters like poor morphology.  So now I have to live with the thought that my MIL ruined our chances of having a child naturally.  Oh and we just found out my SIL who just got married is pregnant.


On top of all that shit I tried asking my well off parents for financial help with IVF (on my Birthday no less) and they said money's not an issue but they refuse to help because IVF means embryos could be destroyed and that goes against their religious convictions (Catholic).  I cried in public and it was the worst birthday I've ever had. I think my parents were my best hope of support and I feel completely rejected.  They don't have any grandchildren and my mother suggested we adopt from China. 


I'm a mess.  And I don't know what to do.  Sorry for the wall of text.

<p>I want to introduce myself (27F) and tell my infertility story of trying to conceive with my husband (30M).  I&#39;m a long time lurker.</p>

<p>Last year after trying for more about three years we went to an RE who ran some tests on us.  </p>

<p>My HSG showed that my right tube could be blocked but due to the dye stopping at the place the tube meets the uterus and me feeling an intense cramp on that side, the RE declared it was probably a spasm and that the tube might be open.  He also off-handedly mentioned that I have a chocolate cyst on my right ovary during an ultrasound and something about poly-cystic ovaries being possible, I think because my left ovary had many follicles pre-ovulation but I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>My husband&#39;s SA came back with very rough numbers.  14mil, 15% motility and 0% morphology.  The RE said that my husband&#39;s morphology meant IVF with ICSI was our best bet.  This was devastating news but he said that I am young so we have time.  We weren&#39;t ready to go down this road yet last year.</p>

<p>He brushed off my issues as not the real problem and I can sort of understand that, but I wish he would have mentioned the fact that a chocolate cyst means I have Endometreosis.  I learned this online only recently.  Now I can&#39;t help but wonder if my fertility is rapidly declining due to Endo.  I wonder if my right tube really is damaged.</p>

<p>Do you think that me having an accurate endo diagnosis will be important for us going into IVF?  I&#39;ve been experiencing more pelvic pain lately and wonder if I should seek treatment.  Should I rush toward IVF?</p>

<p>All of this insanity is compounded by the fact that I found out recently that my MIL (who is someone I am close to) smoked while pregnant with my husband.  I read a study that concluded (in mice) that pregnant females gave birth to male offspring with reduced sperm parameters like poor morphology.  So now I have to live with the thought that my MIL ruined our chances of having a child naturally.  Oh and we just found out my SIL who just got married is pregnant.</p>

Back story:
I've had endo since i was 15 and I'm now 27. In 2014 I had an ectopic in my left tube that resulted in surgery. My fiancé and I postponed our wedding at the time and just picked a new date of August 2017 (3 years engaged together for 5). He's a cancer survivor, had a large osteosarcoma at 16 years of age and was lucky enough to keep his leg. Between the two of us fertility is low! 

Present issue:
So, since our wedding is a year away, I'm turning 28 soon, finishing one degree and then going into an accelerated RN program, I thought it would be wise to go see my Dr regarding future kids. Found out I'm at about 30% fertility and I have adenomyosis. My Dr advised that if we wanted kids we should start trying ASAP with the understanding that we will still probably need fertility treatments. 

So here's the situation. Horribly bad timing. My fiancé is between jobs/careers and wants to go back to school, I'm nowhere near done mine, neither of us make a lot of money as is and he is currently suffering from major depression. We feel like we would not be good parents right now due to the low income and both still trying to figure out careers. Not to mention his mental health, pretty sure adding a potential newborn on top of depression isn't great. We are also currently working on our relationship since it took a hit after the ectopic (I became depressed and then he became depressed) and him realizing he needed to change careers (he had to have surgery on his foot l, not sure still if related to his teen cancer). Anyway, the timing really couldn't be worse for us. We want kids but are worried about bringing them into the world at the wrong time. We don't want to be bad parents or parents who can't provide. However, we can't wait the 3 years needed to have school done and careers started.

I've given up talking to friends because there's only so much ""just relax it'll happen"" platitudes I can take from my incredibly fertile constantly pregnant friends.

In a nutshell - my partner and I have been TTC for 10 months but have never used contraception for 2.5 years. He told me early on he had an undescended testicle until he was 11 - my obsessive googling meant I knew this could be a problem so after 6 months TTC we asked for an SA.

First results (after doctors losing them, not informing us etc etc) came back as sperm count 5.9million, motility 27%, morphology nil as sample too small to test (reading between the lines I guess that means nowt?). His actual sample SIZE has also on both tests been very low (I suspected as much). We're waiting for results of second test but it's taking ages (weeks and weeks)

I'm gutted. I'm frustrated with the waiting, and the doctor's reluctance to explain what the results even MEAN (the only reason I know they are not good is because I researched it).

I'm not sure what I'm after. I guess a bit of perspective - some people who have gone through the same - same level of results - and whether that did or didn't result in pregnancy and what your journeys have been. I'm not looking for success stories. Just real ones, I guess.

My SO and I have been trying to conceive for around two years. We have been married for eight years and have both been pretty ambivalent about having kids. We've had lots of open and honest discussions about it. Then we did the training to become foster parents. One day, out of nowhere, he said he'd decided: he wanted a bio-kid. I went off the pill that day.

There's a line in  *The Bell Jar,* where the 1920's home economics teacher tells her students something like, eggs come from follicles, girls, just like hair. Healthy hair, healthy eggs. So when my period was late on vacation last summer, it was obvious: me and my thick lustrous hair were super-duper fertile! After all, my twin sister had just had a baby, exactly 9 months after her wedding. My husband held my hand as we waited for the pregnancy test. Huh. Nope.

We kept trying. 45-day menstrual cycles. 57 days. I found an OB. She was really nice, really encouraging, and 7 months pregnant herself. She did an exam, ordered blood tests. My husband's everything was normal. My right ovary is cyst-y, but my bloodwork didn't show PCOS. Unexplained oligoovulation. OK, thanks.

For lots of reasons, I quit my job. We started Clomid. Nope. More Clomid. Nope, aaaand now I'm crazy. My OB went on maternity leave, so my next four? five? trans-vag ultrasounds were done by different doctors, whoever in the practice could fit me in. More Clomid. 250mg! Plus a trigger shot! Softcups! Baby aspirin! CoQ10! 

I started crying every time my husband touched me, so we took a month off. Well, I say ""a month"" but cycle day 75 came and went. I took Provera, and made the next available appointment with my nice OB, which was another month later. That was the start of June. We're trying Letrozole this time. I feel less crazy, which is nice. But I still don't leave the house much. I cry most days.

My HSG is scheduled for Tuesday. I have a referral to the fertility specialist, but I haven't scheduled it yet; nothing they do is covered by our insurance. And, for whatever reason, my OB's clinic isn't doing IUIs anymore, they have to be overseen by the RE.

I told my sister, finally, when my husband accidentally let on to her that I'd had an upsetting doctor's appointment. (Aren't they all?) She was pretty shocked. Then she offered to have a baby and give it to us. Fuck.

Nobody else knows. Who would I tell? How?

What's next? Well, we'll keep trying this. We're going to visit my family at Christmas, back home in Australia, that magical land where we have socialized medicine and IVF costs around $2K a round. So we'll see.

Well, that's where we are. We have three(!) family reunions this summer, and all their attendant fecundity. Reading about everyone else's monsters-in-law has always made me feel a little better about mine, who is a new grandma at 75 to my 45yr old SIL's two last-ditch babies. Who are cherubic, of course. Why can't I be related to ugly babies? That would absolutely help.

Some background info, my husband and I have been TTC for over two years. I had a MC last year just before 8 weeks. I have endometriosis and only one ovary (the other was removed during my diagnostic surgery 14 years ago, when I was 16). We've had two failed IUI attempts and are currently on the funded IVF waiting list (we're in Ontario). I have an endometrioma on my ovary, which has been gradually increasing in size.

For the last few weeks my endometrioma has been causing me a lot of pain. We were going to try a final IUI attempt so I went into the RE's for my day 3 scan and blood work, as well as to share my concerns about the endometrioma and how its affecting my health. Currently it's 4.3cm and is causing non-cyclical inflammation pain. The RE concluded that with how the endometrioma is progressing it is unsafe for me to have a medicated cycle, and may be unsafe for me to get pregnant. I have a follow up appointment on July 12 to talk about options. I'm very worried that the ""best"" options presented will either be a drug like lupron (which I've been on before and it was torturous for me) or surgery. If surgery is suggested I'd be worried that if the surgery went wrong I'd lose my only ovary. 

I suppose I'm wondering if anyone has any words of advice to keep me from envisioning the worst case scenario. Or even a similar experience to share.

As I've posted before, we had a d&c about 3 weeks ago after a missed miscarriage at 12 weeks from IVF #2. It was, of course, a shock.

When the doctor told me during the ultrasound, I started sobbing on the table and was a general mess during the rest of that appointment. A couple days later when I went to to see if I could have the d&c, the mistoprostol hadn't worked enough so I was told to wait another day. (talk about making a shitty situation shittier).


That day, he mentioned that they had a psychologist on staff and I could see her for free. I said ok, more to appease him than anything else, but he thought that meant at some point in the future. He meant right then, and we waited like 5 mins in the waiting room and I told me husband I just wanted to go. I was crampy and exhausted so we told the receptionist to cancel and I walked out without seeing her. 

Next day, same shit - I was told to wait one more day. Doc mentioned the psychologist again, and I said no. 
Finally, the next day we went ahead. I got teary in the surgical room, surrounded by other women who I could tell were all getting retrievals or transfers. But I wasn't sobbing and making a show - only one nurse noticed and came over and held my hand for a bit. Nothing out of the ordinary, I would think.


Anyway, the next week at my post D&C checkup, my husband said the doc asked him if I had seen the psychologist, while I was changing. I wish he had told him I have a few online support groups, but anyway. I get the doc is concerned but I'm dealing. 

So today, I was just in a bad mood. We've just got back from a trip, back to the stress of trying to finish these damn renovations with our shithead contractor. Trying to drop the bunch of weight I gained from the two IVFs, and I just feel horrible and super disappointed about that. And there are walls to be painted, and all this crap to do in the house that I have no desire to do. Various annoying things going on. 

So I end up coming across a pregnancy book and crying as I'm cleaning our room, and my husband comes in and asks, ""What's wrong?"". Which is honestly very annoying, and he's done the couple times I've cried in front of him since the mc. Um, what the fuck do you think is wrong?! Why do I have to spell it out every goddamn time? I said, ""What do you think is wrong?"". And he promptly answered, ""I should you should see the psychologist.""

Well, fuuuuuuuccccckkkk you! You know what would make me feel better - not being the only one mourning here. It's been 3 weeks and because I'm still sad about losing my pregnancy, it must mean I need to see someone. Because something is clearly wrong with me. He could have just walked into the room and given me a hug, but no. 

Not to mention I'm still fucking furious that neither he nor his parents bothered to mention to me that he had testicle surgery as a child, when we have been together almost 13 years. And while I know they probably didn't realize that mattered (god forbid someone bother to google something), someone could at least admit the mistake of not bringing it up. If I had known, I could have started this process years ago. And when that thought pops into my head, it adds to the frustrated crying.

I'm by no means saying there is anything wrong with seeing a therapist, but it's not what I want. I feel better chatting to people who have been through the same thing, and don't want to chat to the adorable, perky 27 year old therapist who probably has a bunch of kids at home. 

I've had a lot of loss in my life, I've had to deal with grief. But when you lose a grown person, you're not the only one grieving. This is far more isolating. I'm grieving not only for my mc, but just for having to go through the whole process in general. And not only that, but I have to hide my grief as well. Three weeks in and I should just get over it? 

**update** Thanks all for your support. 
Hubs and I had a good talk this morning - I told him I felt like he just didn't want to deal with it, and I shouldn't be expected to just forget when it's only been 3 weeks. He apologized, said he loves me and said that he's just crappy at this stuff and suggested the therapist because he didn't really know what else to say. And I said I know I was being hormonal and overreacted. We both had a little cry and agreed we just want to move on past this, and we've had a good day today!

<p>For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on <a href=""/r/whatworkedforme"">/r/whatworkedforme</a> and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, <a href=""/r/InfertilityBabies"">/r/InfertilityBabies</a>. Of course, you are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences (and continue to support other community members) here on <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a>.</p>

<p>Negative results are also welcome here, though they need not be confined to this thread. Members with questionable results who want immediate support, and those who need their follow-up questions to be open to greater and faster readership are, as always, welcome to post freely on the main board.</p>

<p>We are not banning any kind of post, either here or on the main board, but rather we see this as an opportunity for members to continue to share with those who are following their journey, but do so in a way that respects the feelings and wishes of those for whom individual results posts would be burdensome. As always, please refer to the sidebar where you will find our subreddit guidelines and a short list of other related subreddits and resources you may find useful throughout your journey.</p>

185,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Background:

I am a mid-twenties trans male (biological sex: female, identified gender: male) that began Hormone Replacement Therapy approximately a year and a half ago. I made the personal decision to begin hormone treatment prior to fertility treatment out of necessity and lack of funds. My menstrual cycle was interrupted three months after the initiation of testosterone injections. I have been pregnant and have miscarried prior to male hormone treatment. I have been off male hormone therapy for almost three months, and resumed my menstrual cycle 4 weeks ago.

Goal:
I am currently looking to preserve my ability to have children, as there is minimal data on how male hormone therapy affects a trans male's fertility over time. I have a biologically male partner in his early thirties (not the same partner from the pregnancy) and we are not ready to have children at this point in time, but we would like to retain the ability for the future. I would like to accomplish egg/embryo banking in the near future so that I may continue my transition with a hysterectomy, lowering the possibility of certain cancers and my testosterone dosage requirements.

Funding:
Medical or personal loans are not likely to be an option, as our credit is poor and we would like to not take on more debt. We do not have money saved up at the moment, however, $5k expenditure on fertility and up to ~$10k is feasible if possible, but would take a longer time frame to save.

Insurance:
I carry Blue Cross Blue Shield and am listed as female in the system (I have not changed my legal gender). After a talk with a benefits specialists, it was revealed to me that initial diagnosis would be covered, however, fertility coverage includes a 20% co-pay after deductible and covers labs and x-rays only. I have $458 remaining for my yearly deductible. IVF and cryopreservation are not covered. 

Reproductive Endocrinologist:
We are having an information session with the endocrinologist in a week and a half to explore our options.

The Question:
My knowledge on the subject is extremely limited, and I am having trouble finding answers to the fundamental questions. I thought that this would be a safe place to ask these questions. I presume that our primary option is through IVF treatment and egg/embryo banking. However, I was wondering if it is possible to fertilize the egg though sexual intercourse, and then use retrieval for embryo banking. Is embryo retrieval a possibility, or is it necessary for us to undergo IVF treatment? Our goal is to avoid the high costs of IVF.

I have done some surface research in fertility tourism and have estimated that Israel would be a reasonable alternative for low-cost IVF, and has the benefit of being LGBT-friendly (unlike some alternatives such as India, with even lower IVF costs). I have read estimates such as $5.5k for Israel for IVF, and ~$900 for round-trip airfare (which of course would be incurred again if an additional cycle is necessary), whereas the treatment in the U.S. (where I am located) ranges from $9k-$12k. I was also wondering if it was possible to transport my partner's sperm to the country where IVF will be undertaken to avoid higher transportation costs.

**TL;DR: I am female-to-male trans male (pre bottom surgery) with a male partner seeking to freeze my eggs/embryos for future use.**

**Edit: Thanks to everyone for bringing the cost of gestational carrying to the front of my mind. I was so concerned with the egg retrieval process that I hadn't given much weight to this more costly issue. I am likely now to postpone my hysterectomy so that I can carry myself or to plan on adoption. I will still meet the RE and report back.**

**Edit: I wanted to thank everybody for being so helpful and understanding. I will update when I return from the RE next week.**

The simple explanation is that she has always favored my Aunt, and now also favors my cousins as well. Over the years she has abused me too much emotionally to want to continue to engage with her. She would deliberately create lies to try and wedge my cousins and I apart, and would do the same between my Aunt and my Mom. Trust me when I say that she acts with the emotional intelligence of an impulsive child. Whenever I have tried to communicate about how she has made me feel, she would blow up with complete hostility, tell me she was 'done' with me, or my personal favorite - tell blatant lies to my family to recruit them to her side. 


When I had my ectopic/salpingectomy in 2013, it took 8 weeks for my hCG to go down enough for me to get my first period. After that 8 weeks, I got my first (horrible) period the day before we had a family dinner scheduled for my Mom's birthday. Everyone present knew what had happened to us, and gave us all those really sad, weak smiles. We had not been seated for 10 minutes, and that's when my Nana took it upon herself to announce my second-cousins pregnancy at the table. That cousin was NOT EVEN PRESENT. There was absolutely no reason to announce it, but she made a point of saying how 'excited' she was to 'finally have a baby in the family'. Still feeling (obviously) raw, I politely excused myself to go outside to take a breather, but as I was leaving the table I heard her say, ""Oh what's the big deal, I had a miscarriage when I was younger and you dont see me making a big deal out of it."" That was it for me, honestly. That was the defining moment where I just had enough of her. 

Now, she is 78 years of age - and is on Facebook more than anyone I know. I have her blocked on Facebook (after major inappropriate behavior and aggressively interacting with friends of mine) from seeing what I post about 99.9% of the time, but when I post about our IVF treatment, I unblock her temporarily. Not because I want her to know, but because she lives with my Aunt, and if my Aunt mentioned seeing something on Facebook and Nana realized  that she was blocked, it would cause my Aunt (and I) drama. When I posted about our FET coming up, a few close friends commented of course, and one asked if our meds would be as expensive as they were for our first round of IVF. I told them thankfully no, but we still have to pay for them out of pocket. Well apparently after reading this interaction my Nana decided to paypal me $50, but not before she posted on Facebook about giving me money. She had to make sure to let everyone know that she 'helped', because that is more important to her than anything else. I am still unsure what I want to do about the money - on principle, I dont want it, but refusing it might make more waves than I need in my life right now. 

I of course messaged her to thank her for her generosity, hoping that would be the end of it. After a few questions, she then dropped this little ditty on me:

""I am very confident that *we* are going to have a baby.""

We, huh? I didn't realize you were my husband... or the team of doctors/nurses/embryologists who have been trying to get me pregnant. I also didn't realize that WE are getting regular twat wandings, and catheters inserted into our cervix. We have so much in common!

I really dont know why her statement bothers me so much. I'm not sure if it's because that ""we"" includes her in this process when she clearly did not give a shit about my suffering that LED US HERE. I'm not sure if it's the fact that the ""we"" implies that she has some sort of possession over our unborn, but it really made me sick inside when I read that. 

I know we all have different pet peeves here, but my biggest infertility pet peeve is when people tell me that treatment will work for us. In fact, I have posted about this topic on Facebook numerous times. That Resolve article that talks about IVF ettiquette and what not to say? I have posted that (or a similar article) several times over the years. She has even commented saying, ""some people are so thoughtless."" I have posted it enough to know that she should know how I feel, but here she is ignoring it anyway. Hell, my RE doesn't even use phrases of certainty like that and she is the one we have entrusted to help us. So if the specialized Doctor is not giving me platitudes, could you maybe just NOT? There are no guarantees in this process, so you can take your confidence and shove it up your ass. I hate how people think IVF is just a 'fix all', that you do a round of IVF and poof you are pregnant. 

What I am confident in, is my team of supporters, doctors, and nurses. We have entrusted them to help us, but the rest is up to my body and just pure luck/chance. 

I'm sorry for the rant, I really try not to let this sort of stuff get to me, but after our IVF failure, I have days where I feel really resentful. 

I hope everyone has a good holiday weekend!

Tomorrow's Election Day in Australia. Infertility has made me obsessed with one issue ... the cost of IVF. I hate that. 

Last year the government tried to bring in changes to Medicare which would have meant IVF out-of-pocket prices would have increased. Some commentators said it could go to $15,000 a cycle out of pocket (health insurance doesn't cover IVF here). Others said it would be less, but still an increase.

It looks like the government will be returned, and I'm shit scared they're going to try bringing in their medicare changes again.

I'm surrounded by people who are ""Well, the two parties aren't any different"" and I find it hard not to get emotional. Like, yeah, that's a valid viewpoint to have, but to me one party might mean the end of my dreams of having a child.

<p>Tomorrow&#39;s Election Day in Australia. Infertility has made me obsessed with one issue ... the cost of IVF. I hate that. </p>

<p>Last year the government tried to bring in changes to Medicare which would have meant IVF out-of-pocket prices would have increased. Some commentators said it could go to $15,000 a cycle out of pocket (health insurance doesn&#39;t cover IVF here). Others said it would be less, but still an increase.</p>

<p>It looks like the government will be returned, and I&#39;m shit scared they&#39;re going to try bringing in their medicare changes again.</p>

Just thought I'd update you guys on my egg retrieval yesterday morning.  They got 29 eggs!! I woke up from the anasthesia asking about them...and then shouted out my excitement to some random dude in the recovery area about my number lol.  My poor husband was like....he doesn't know what you are talking about lol.

The embryologist called today and 19 have made it to fertilization! They split up the eggs half and half with ICSI and traditional IVF. With ICSI 12 of the 14 made it to this first benchmark! Woohoo!  With regular IVF 7 of the 15 made it to today :). Super excited.  The embryologist will call Saturday with an update and transfer is scheduled for Monday July 4th.  I'm taking it as a hopeful good sign, transferring on a holiday :).

Now for the not so fun part.  The recovery from this damn retrieval is AWFUL.  I haven't been able to hardly even stand for more than two minutes yesterday and today.  Like I'm scared to even shower until my husband gets off work because I don't wanna fall.  My abdomen isn't as swollen as yesterday but is still so heavy and tender.  And dear god the constipation!!!

I'm on a pill to prevent OHSS and I was able to sleep on my side last night so I'm hoping to avoid it.  I'm nervous transferring feeling like I do now- which is a filled to burst bubble.

And, I have a story that i'm finally able to laugh about and thought I'd share as maybe it will help someone else laugh or at least, commiserate.

We tried for a baby for over year with no luck and 1 chemical pregnancy. 3 months of clomid, trigger shots with timed intercourse. We moved on to IUI; yesterday was my 2nd IUI (fingers crossed) it would have been number 3, BUT the first IUI attempt was botched.

6am, 3 months ago.......... Husband produced a sample at home and I was to bring it to the clinic. I was not thrilled with how much of a sample was in the jar and did a REAL BAD job of hiding my disappointment (because hormones) and I'm fairly certain that when we were't trying to get pregnant, I had to clean up A LOT more semen  than was produced that fateful morning.

He was upset that I was upset and the clock was ticking, both of them, i had 45 minutes to get from one end of NY to the other for the sample to be viable... (I also spend a lot on cabs, an unexpected fertility expense) So i placed the specimen jar in a ziplock bag, put it on the inside of my jacket pocket to keep it warm and hailed a cab. While in said cab, I decided to google ""how much semen needed for IUI"" and carefully removed the jar from my jacket to inspect if what we had here was going to be sufficient.... Well neither my husband or I apparently know how to secure a lid and it was everywhere but in the jar.  I thought I could scoop it into the jar from the ziplock, pour it maybe? While crying uncontrollably, and trying to salvage what was left, we hit a bump and it wasn't pretty... though I'm sure there are worse ways to get semen in the back seat of your cab.

In the moment, i was so sad and desperate and lonely, I had to call and explain the situation to the nurse since i wasn't coming in for my appointment. Tell the cab driver my destination had changed and went straight to work with a tear streamed face.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude again to this community for how helpful and welcoming you were to an outsider. 

An update on my friend: IVF has not **officially** failed, but she is sure it has. Yesterday and today at 11 and 12 days post-embryo transfer, she had pink in her CM. Not a full flow, not even reaching the toilet paper. Her provider's office told her this could be implantation bleeding, it could be spotting that some women experience all through pregnancy, or it could be her period. She's supposed to monitor and call with changes. Her appointment for a pregnancy blood test is on Friday. 

She is still devastated. There's no talking to her. She's back at work today and we chatted for just a couple minutes on gchat before she signed off. I don't know whether she couldn't cope and went home, or if she's blocked me again like she did when I was pregnant with my first child. I hope it's the former, but I am preparing for it to be the latter. 

I sent her a quick ""love you, thinking of you"" text a few minutes ago, and I'm going to leave it at that for now. I might send a text to her husband (we're friends) to let him know they're in my thoughts, too. He's very upset but a little less emotional about it as far as I understand from her. 

As far as what the pink CM actually means at 11 & 12 days post-transfer, you guys probably know better than I do. She seems to think her provider is stringing her along for false hope until they can officially call it a failure. 

Anyway, I really just wanted to thank you all for your support and input. Thanks again for being so gracious.

Today is the day I need to change that in order to not go completely crazy. Here is the thing. Hubby has low sperm count. We had two IVF ICSI cycles, both didn't work and nobody really knows why. So we're in this limbo, not knowing what to do, not knowing if we should try again. So we decided to visit another clinic, ask what they think, and then maybe giving it another try. So today I wanted to set up an appointment. All I wanted was to get a date and a time for this new location to visit. I was prepared to say my name and date of birth, and maybe some background story. But nope, it went in a completely different direction. First thing they asked was ""where did you hear about us??"" - well, online somewhere, why do you care... I said ""internet"". They continued to ask a LOT. My name, complete address, date of birth, the whole insurance thing even though the insurance won't pay a dime anyway. They asked a ton of questions about me. Not caring about me, just caring about this stupid questionnaire. Have I been pregnant before? Well no, thanks for asking. At this point I started silently crying. Do you have illnesses? Allergies? No, hubby is the ""problem""! Did you try IVF before? Yes, twice, thanks for rubbing that in... Did I have retrievals? Yes (crying a little more). Did I have transfers? Yes. (Crying even more). And no, they didn't work. At this point she told me they need all the information and need to know where it was and stuff like that. What? Why? I just wanted an appointment! Then they started asking about hubby. Does hubby have kids? I'm trying to sound normal while tears are flowing. No, of course he doesn't. Has his sperm been tested? What do you think how and why we did IVF twice?? Was it normal? No, for crying out loud, it was not! It's why we need ICSI! Why don't you just ask me what the problem is?? Why do they make it so hard?? Patient care? Oh no, all they care about is their stupid questionnaire. I would have been fine telling my story, but the way I got asked felt like I was being interrogated. It felt like I did something wrong. They scolded me for not having all the information ready. They really NEEEEED it before the appointment. Yeah, yeah, I get it! Now, I totally understand they need all the information they can get. I would have given it to them gladly. But at this point I don't even know if we want to go through the whole thing again. I just wanted a first appointment to talk about our options and then decide if we want to try another cycle. I really wasn't prepared for this phone call. Which is why I'm now trying to tell you here, maybe it'll help someone else who is about to make a similar call. Be prepared. I thought they know what people they are talking to, but they don't seem to care. After the call I cried loudly for several minutes. This is not what I expected. I just wanted to make an appointment. Well, I got one. But I'm really not sure I trust this clinic. But here is the thing, I'm pretty sure setting up appointments is the same in other clinics too...

No, hubby is the &quot;problem&quot;! Did you try IVF before? Yes, twice, thanks for rubbing that in... Did I have retrievals? Yes (crying a little more). Did I have transfers? Yes. (Crying even more). And no, they didn&#39;t work. At this point she told me they need all the information and need to know where it was and stuff like that. What? Why? I just wanted an appointment! Then they started asking about hubby. Does hubby have kids? I&#39;m trying to sound normal while tears are flowing. No, of course he doesn&#39;t. Has his sperm been tested? What do you think how and why we did IVF twice?? Was it normal? No, for crying out loud, it was not! It&#39;s why we need ICSI! Why don&#39;t you just ask me what the problem is?? Why do they make it so hard?? Patient care? Oh no, all they care about is their stupid questionnaire. I would have been fine telling my story, but the way I got asked felt like I was being interrogated. It felt like I did something wrong. They scolded me for not having all the information ready. They really NEEEEED it before the appointment. Yeah, yeah, I get it! Now, I totally understand they need all the information they can get. I would have given it to them gladly. But at this point I don&#39;t even know if we want to go through the whole thing again. I just wanted a first appointment to talk about our options and then decide if we want to try another cycle. I really wasn&#39;t prepared for this phone call. Which is why I&#39;m now trying to tell you here, maybe it&#39;ll help someone else who is about to make a similar call. Be prepared. I thought they know what people they are talking to, but they don&#39;t seem to care. After the call I cried loudly for several minutes. This is not what I expected. I just wanted to make an appointment. Well, I got one. But I&#39;m really not sure I trust this clinic. But here is the thing, I&#39;m pretty sure setting up appointments is the same in other clinics too... Maybe it was just easier when I did it the first time because I could say &quot;don&#39;t know&quot;, or &quot;haven&#39;t tried yet&quot;, etc. to every question... Has anyone else changed clinics between cycles? How did it go?</p>

The next one had a doubling time of 67 hours, which my clinic said was totally fine for an FET, that anything under 72 hours was normal.  They rechecked the hCG levels 3 days later then because I had to go in for a progesterone and estrogen check anyway, and that time my hCG only rose 17% in 3 days.  Horrible rise.  I cried a lot, we knew we were losing it, etc.  That was Friday the 17th.

They had me come back Sunday the 19th for another draw to confirm either a plateau or that it's falling... and it came back 48% higher in 2 days this time.  So a huge speed up.  Now that it had proven itself to be erratic, I was suddenly at risk for ectopic.

Fuck fuck fuck.

They told me they had to wait until I was 6w to confirm if it was ectopic, and seeing as how at 5w0d my hCG was only 568 and not increasing very quickly, they didn't think they'd see anything sooner.  They said to call them right away if I felt any significant or consistent pain before that next appointment. 

Thursday the 23rd, I was feeling some twingy consistent ache for a few hours, so I called.  I figured there would be no harm, better safe than sorry.  I went in for an ultrasound, and they were able to visualize a small gestational sac in my uterus (yay no ectopic).  I was 5w4d, and it was measuring 5w1d.  Ok, well considering the weird 3 day slowdown I had, that makes sense.  They took my hCG that day, and it nearly quadrupled since Sunday!  Suddenly it seemed like maybe we had hope.  

Yesterday I went in for another ultrasound at 6w1d.  Even though we knew the likely outcome, we still were hoping for a miracle.  But this time the gestational sac only grew ""2 days'"" worth - from 5w1d to 5w3d, and still no yolk.  So it was then measuring 5 days behind at that point, and appeared to be slowing down.

Talk about a fucking roller coaster.

Anyway, they're ready to call it.  Whatever is growing in me isn't healthy at all, this herky-jerky growth isn't good and isn't going to result in a healthy viable pregnancy.  I'm waiting for the phone call this morning to get on the schedule for a D&C later this week, probably Thursday.  We'll do one more ultrasound to be sure, but I'm all out of hope.  I'm so exhausted.

We're going straight for the D&C so they can test the tissue in the gestational sac for genetic abnormalities.  Also because two years ago when I had a loss at a similar time (though it was a more developed gestational sac - 7w - with corresponding normal hormones, just no fetus - yay blighted ovums), I went off progesterone hoping to pass it naturally.  After 3 weeks that didn't happen, so I did cytotec/misoprostol, then had retained tissue 2 weeks later, did a second round of cytotec, that failed, and so I had to go in for a D&C anyway.  Fuck all that noise, I'm going straight to D&C this time.

Anyway, just wanted to give you all an update since it was pregnancy related and thus I couldn't post this hell while it was happening to me.

Our first obgyn (not an RE) (aside from being horrible to deal with and making lots of mistakes) advised us to go straight to ED as we would never get pregnant with our own embryos.

Our new RE explained it is likely due to sperm factors and it would be worthwhile trying IMSI (used ISCI last time). 

(For those who are interested our RE explained that embryos from fertilisation to D3 are controlled by female DNA then from D3 onwards the sperm DNA starts to play a role, so if you are find your embryos are dropping off around this time it might be sperm issues, (or a combination of egg and sperm issues because good quality eggs can make up for bad sperm)). 

Well last time (IVF#1) basically we got called every couple of days by the clinic to update us, and tell us that half our remaining embryos had continued to die /broken down, until we couldn't take it anymore and asked them to only call once they were all gone, which they did two days later (D4/D5), this time (IVF#2) for our own sanity we have decided to wait until ether we would know how many survived to biopsy (we are doing PGD) or how many are healthy (I.e. Cleared by PGD testing) or if they are all gone. I'm going so crazy right now with the need to know but I feel like it will be bad luck to find out (stupid right)! So I need to wait 6-7 more days to know how many have survived to biopsy (egg collection was today and I feel awful, so bloated and in so much pain!) or 5 weeks for PGD results. 

Does anyone have any stories like ours, I would love to hear from anyone who has had embryos pull through on their next cycle, or succeeded with IMSI, or if you have any idea on expected attrition rates? As far as I can find we would be expecting a 50% attrition rate at each step, so if we start with 20 eggs about 10might fertilise, 5might make it to D3 and 2might make it to d5, and one might be healthy/pass PGD. Which is what we saw last time but we only started with 10, so none made it to D5. :(!

 The worst was that the nurses keeps telling us (this time and last) that it will work well because we are <35 years old.

PGS is back on the frozen already and it looks good. So now the debate as to when to transfer is on.

<p>I enjoyed my time off. I am drinking like the lush I am currently. There&#39;s been a lot of talk of what happens if we move to DE in terms of how many times we go. We&#39;re pretty confident in DE. I&#39;ve had a successful pregnancy. I&#39;m super healthy. His sperm is always great on paper at least.

Well, my second monitoring 2 days later I had 8 follicles, all under 10 and estrogen was 90. I still wasnt happy, but I was able to keep my shit together. Third monitoring, yesterday, after 9.5 days of stims, my total count went up to 13, 3 over 10, 6 over 5 and the rest under 5, estrogen was 590. Im still not crazy about how this shit is turning out because reasons:

1. I'm fucking DOR and they had me on 5 weeks of BCPs and 12 days if Lupron BEFORE EVEN STARTING STIMS! When I asked my RE why im having such a sluggish response, he said ""well that can happen with extended Lupron use in DOR patients"" OMG, then why the fuck did he have me take it that long?!

2. I saw a different RE at my last monitoring (now all 5 REs at our clinic have seen my vagina, yay) and he said ""you want to start IVF with high a dose to recruit as many follicles as you can in the beginning for greatest total number of eggs at retreival"". Well, my RE had me on 300iu Gonal-f for the first 2 days, then added 75iu menopur the next 2 days. Now I'm up to 375iu Gonal-f and 150iu menopur. He had me go the opposite direction the other RE recommended and I dont know how to feel about that.

3. This fucking cycle has been delayed because their newly aquired surgical center was undergoing renovations AND NO ONE FUCKING TOLD ME! I was told my egg retrieval would be tomorrow, the 28th, at the latest, now he says the 1st or the 2nd. Well shit, the moving company is supposed to be delivering our belongings on the 1st. It'll take us 3 days for us to driveto to California, so I just don't know WTF to do about that.

4. My husband keeps fucking nagging me about how much more meds/monitoring I need and how much it's all going to cost. Im about ready to just tell him it'll be cheaper for him to find a new and fertile wife. Like I dont feel fucking guilty enough about being infertile, now he's a constant reminder about how much precious money my ovaries are costing him/us.

I'm just so fucking angry. All of everything above may just be normal shit and how my shitty cookie crumbles, but I'm just so fucking angry. I'm channeling my anger at my husband and RE and I believe that's misguided. I just want to break my knuckles on *someone's* face!

Lastly, just want to say I've been swamped. I haven't been too active here, but I've been lurking when I get a few minutes to myself. I'm thinking of and hoping for all of you amazing people.

I have no fever or Anything like that. A lot of the day I don't even notice it, and it does seem to be less bothersome than two days ago. I'm also on my vacation in Peru dealing with altitude sickness and super dry weather, so who knows. It almost feels like those light cramps/ligament pains I had when pregnant.

<p>Anyway: Has anyone stimmed this long? If, so, what was the outcome? Is it okay to stimulate that long on such a high dose? I&#39;ve read that stimming too long could hurt egg quality :/!!</p>
