&#x200B;

Every single person I know, aside from my husband, has ignored the near-death aspect of my infertility trauma, especially her. For the year and a half since then, it's been one word answers like or ""Oh, that sucks."" When talking about my infertility and then the treatments. When I try to talk about work or interesting podcasts, or anything positive/ not about infertility, she acts bored. Our friendship has always been more about emotional support than intellectual interests, but now I'm starting to feel like it was always pretty one-sided.   


Today I told her I met in person with someone from TFAB, and it was super helpful to talk with someone also going through treatment and I felt lighter for once and she ripped into this long spiel about how I've been saying hurtful things since my fertility problems began. She said when I talk about what I went through or my attempts at treatment, It's like I'm overshadowing her. I responded that a lot of my pain was in people ignoring the life-or-death peril I was in and she continued to refuse to acknowledge it, repeating again and again that she has fertility issues too. 

&#x200B;

Now, I knew she's had trouble getting pregnant in the past. She has one child. But she has repeatedly said she won't have more children and constantly complains about her kid and how much motherhood sucks, which has always been very hurtful to me. But I wanted her to have a space to be honest about her feelings. She claimed in this exchange that she's only not having more kids because she can't and me talking about what I went through is like saying her experience doesn't count. She never told me she tried again after her first kid. She had made some off-handed comments about going off birth control because it was annoying and if she got pregnant then so be it, but I feel like that is pretty different then active tracking, treatments, medication and money flushed down the toilet every month.

So my experience over the last year has been filled with anxiety and feeling upset/pissed off. Started with me seeing a doc cause I felt run down. Turns out that lead me to get testosterone panel. After retests my T 310 ng/dL , 76 pg/ml free test and 10 nmol/L SHBG.LH is 6.5 and FSH is 16.9(high). I also got screened for testicle size 13 cc left 20 cc right. Oh and KS and Y del tests are negative too
During which they detected bilateral varicoceles. Saw a specialist and even chatted w Doctor Turek. They both said the atrophy on left nut is from varicocele since there shouldnt be such a big difference. So I got my SA done and showed a complete 0. I dont have a gf but I have hopes and dreams to have a big family one day. This honestly has been the toughest, I hope someone I love will want to be w me for me and build a family no matter what it takes. So I got the surgery and I feel really good again , not as much feeling down and more energy.
I am currently taking Vitamin D, COQ10, L Arginine and Multi vitamin. Well I got my analysis done at the 5 month mark and still 0....... Fuck! So now im gonna be on Clomid low dose 25 mg everyother day. Question is my doc told me this could be a year to see if any improvement and there is higher succes from varicocele surgery anyway.

Q How did you guys deal w it. Do I need to tell ppl I date or until it is a serious GF or the one. Do you see this as a issue from a female side. I have been open w my parents and doctors.. they support me which helps I know id never go down a dark path to any thoughts just venting and saying hello.
IM NOT GIVING UP IM GONNA HAVE A FAMILY ONE DAY NO MATTER WHAT. I proved people wrong and beat odds before and Ill do it again. If all else fails I get a mTESE. NEVER GIVE UP THE FIGHT. IT IS A INVISIBLE AFFLICTION. As a man I am man enough to fight this and win time to step up.
Many people have struggles this is mine, I have a dream of a family one day and Ill get it . You gotta be hungry you gotta be motivated and live your life like me. DM me if you wanna talk. I wonder to myself why me time to time yes but its my life and I gotta use what I got. Otherwise im a healthy young man 28 years young with a great dog, new place, new job and support system.

Over the next 2 years got pregnant and miscarried 3 times. Moved on to IVF, where we had 3 retrievals that resulted in zero blasts (the last cycle we transferred a fresh 3 day that didn't take). Moved on to donor egg, did 2 transfers of PGS normals, no positives. Moved onto second donor, transferred 1 pgs normal, didn't take. (This is the recent loss).

I've had the ERA test, uterus checked out (slightly heartshaped but not enough to warrant surgery). When RE called she sounded out of ideas. She said our case is unusual, 3 donor egg transfers not working. She said we could do the ERA again but when I pressed what that would accomplish she admitted probably no new info (which makes me not really trust she knows what she's doing here?). She also mentioned the Receptiva test. And asked if my periods were regular and if I might be perimenopausal. Periods are very not regular (swing from 21-60 days) but no hot flashes. She mentioned changing up the protocol, maybe Lupron. Right now I've been on the ""advanced"" protocol of 6 estrace a day, plus a patch, plus endo vag pill, plus PIO shots. She is hesitant to do another transfer without knowing more of ""what's going on."" I asked about hidden PCOS and a lap (I have a lot of facial hair), she is going to test my hormones when my period comes to check the perimenopausal thing and that.

24,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Does anyone have experience with starting a new treatment in the cycle immediately following an incomplete IVF? 

After yet another heartbreaking IVF which yielded no viable eggs for transfer, we have to decide how to proceed. 

In my country you have to wait a whole cycle to start the next treatment after a fresh transfer (which is the norm). This means that after the TWW and the period that follows you then have to wait a full cycle for the next period to arrive before starting the next IVF. The ideas is to allow the body to get back to normal after stimulation (not sure if this is the approach everywhere?). 

So, after the message yesterday that there was nothing left for the fresh transfer, we expected to have to wait approx. a month and a half for move ahead.

However, much to our surprise our doctor said that we could also move straight into a new treatment already at the arrival of my upcoming period since I would then have been without treatment for approx. 3 weeks since the trigger, which should be enough. He then moved away from that suggestion a bit after having discussed with himself, concluding that it might be good to allow for my low egg-yielding body to get completely back to non-treastment mode. But I think he could be OK with both solutions. 

We were not ready to be confronted with this option and I don't know whether to push for the earlier treatment. On one hand I would love to move ahead as quickly as possible, on the other I want to make sure to have an optimal cycle with the best chance of success. 

Anyone with any experience on this out there?

Over 4 IVF's I've gotten 28 eggs, 2 nice enough to transfer on day 2, 0 make it to blast/freeze.

For my first IVF I had a successful transfer which however ended with TFMR much later.

We have been trying for almost a year...using LH strips and having plenty of sex.  I am tired of all the statistics...i know I am old (44); that my eggs are bad.  I have heard it a million times.

What I dont understand is why I was told that they wouldnt want to do laporascopic surgery to check for endo or scar tissue  if I am not willing to do IVF.  She said, because I dont have sxs of endo and they wouldnt want to put me through all of that if I didnt want to pursue IVF.  I honestly dont believe I have endo, but I know I have a lot of scar tissue from 2 open abdominal surgeries and one laparoscopic surgery and 1 perforated IUD and 1 embedded IUD.  I have pain with bowel movements and tons if spotting, all which started at age 22 when my 1st IUD perforated. I have lots if cramping before, after ovulation, and the week before my spotting starts ...this has never changed.

 I was told that due to my lupus and antiphospholipid antibodies, they cant use a lot of what is in their toolbox...???!!! I have NOT been diagnosed with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and my lupus is super mild and controlled by Plaquinil.  One & a half years ago I was prescribed OCPs without a blink of the eye, because nobody no one knew I had lupus or  the APL antibodies.  

Super super frustrated...i dont even know what the other options in the toolbox are..""because of my lupus"".  What am I missing out on?

Option 1 given:    200mg Prometrium BID vaginally  instead of the progesterone suppository I was given that is 200mg QD, compounded at a compounding pharmacy.  The compounded C-progesterone irritated my vulva so bad I cant handle it, plus the side effects were outragous.  (Ravenous appetite and emotional lability).  She said the prometrium vaginally would not irritate my vagina as much and would need to be twice a day.   Not to mention, literally no one has even tested my progesterone level.  I spot 11 days a month on average, with one of those days being regular light flow, right about in the middle of all the spotting.   Anyone have experience with both progesterones? I havent taken it for 6 days and am still emotional and bloated.

 Option 2 given:  IUI
Option 3 given: IVF

I am still confused as to why my CD3 estradiol is considered ""high"" @136 ""due to my AMH of 0 4"".  FSH 3.3, antral follicle count 10-11 each ovary but I have chronic complex ovarian cysts ..currently 1 on each ovary..that she said likely are producing too much estrogen, and why I have so much spotting.  I dont believe this is the cause...because my complex cysts started 10 years ago max, and my spotting started over 20 years ago when the IUD perforated.  The gyn said that the entire back of my uterus is covered in scar tissue..and my uterus is retroverted, which is what I akways attributed the pain from Bowel movements with after the IUD perforated.

Potential option 4: Femara (why, and what about it?  Nothing really explained other than it makes you produce mire eggs since most of mine are probably junk.  Can anyone explain how is this used , when, and side effects?

Potential option #5: endometrial biopsy due to all my spotting she felt i might have a thick endometrial lining.  I have had 2 endometrial biopsies in the past due to all my spotting and it always comes out normal. I told her she could do one but it would probably come out normal..who knows.  

Angry reason #2 : so what is the endometrial biopsy information going to change in terms of plan of care for trying to get pregnant?

I am sorry for being so emotional..I am literally never like this unless I am pregnant or on OCPs....which is a reason I dont think I can tolerate the progesterone when I couldnt even tolerate it at 200mg QD (let alone increasing it BID).

I would like to learn about my options ..I have no idea what to do, but I know we are not doing IVF despite  the 5% chance we have without it ..all statistically driven.  Note:  I as also told that statistically my risk of IUD perforation was 2% and the chances of the same individual having an embedment 15 years later impossible.   Also, what are the chances a person has lupus, or APL antibodies, or dislocated their patella twice *the 2nd time while at a pub in Ireland after Rod Stewart walked in) or breaks their elbow in half and has 3 surgeries because of hardware and the bone healing wrong..or someone who spots 11 days a month for 22 years..you see....i am just  worn out on statistics, because statistics have never proven to be in my favor.

I am thinking about just putting it in Gods hands.  But then I am still left to question when to have a tubal ligation and obliterate any chance of pregnancy at all, because, after all is said and done,  I do not want to be like my grandmother who had a last child at age 51, by accident.

I just dont know what ""plan of action"" is prudent..and I am supposed to decide and call and let them know.

PS, i forgot my spouses sperm count is low as well as motility and other stuff.  He is supposed to take zinc and Vit. C and stop using the sauna and to stop taking tub baths every day, then get it re-checked in a month.  My HSG a month ago unblocked my L.

<p>We have been trying for almost a year...using LH strips and having plenty of sex.  I am tired of all the statistics...i know I am old (44); that my eggs are bad.  I have heard it a million times.</p>

<p>What I dont understand is why I was told that they wouldnt want to do laporascopic surgery to check for endo or scar tissue  if I am not willing to do IVF.  She said, because I dont have sxs of endo and they wouldnt want to put me through all of that if I didnt want to pursue IVF.  I honestly dont believe I have endo, but I know I have a lot of scar tissue from 2 open abdominal surgeries and one laparoscopic surgery and 1 perforated IUD and 1 embedded IUD.  I have pain with bowel movements and tons if spotting, all which started at age 22 when my 1st IUD perforated. I have lots if cramping before, after ovulation, and the week before my spotting starts ...this has never changed.</p>

<p>I was told that due to my lupus and antiphospholipid antibodies, they cant use a lot of what is in their toolbox...???!!! I have NOT been diagnosed with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and my lupus is super mild and controlled by Plaquinil.  One &amp; a half years ago I was prescribed OCPs without a blink of the eye, because nobody no one knew I had lupus or  the APL antibodies.  </p>

<p>Super super frustrated...i dont even know what the other options in the toolbox are..&quot;because of my lupus&quot;.  What am I missing out on?</p>

<p>Option 1 given:    200mg Prometrium BID vaginally  instead of the progesterone suppository I was given that is 200mg QD, compounded at a compounding pharmacy.  The compounded C-progesterone irritated my vulva so bad I cant handle it, plus the side effects were outragous.  (Ravenous appetite and emotional lability).  She said the prometrium vaginally would not irritate my vagina as much and would need to be twice a day.   Not to mention, literally no one has even tested my progesterone level.  I spot 11 days a month on average, with one of those days being regular light flow, right about in the middle of all the spotting.   Anyone have experience with both progesterones? I havent taken it for 6 days and am still emotional and bloated.</p>

They specialize in a very niche field. IVF/IUI/TI. There's only like 30 different types of medications total. There's like 3 relevant body parts. 

Why are they constantly acting so overwhelmed and confused?

I've been to four clinics and each one was trash in its own way when it comes to dealing with nurses/administrators. Either the nurses are mean, insurance is run by three babies in a trenchcoat randomly mashing diagnosis and procedure codes into a computer, or admins act like they can't schedule an appointment (spoiler alert; a fucking Google calendar with appointment slots could do your job).

My current clinic was ""one of the good ones"" but lately they've started to become trash. I got my FET directions/orders and **I had to point out** that they hadn't given me a stop date for birth control. Imagine if this was my first rodeo? I would have stayed on birth control while on fucking estrogen. 

I am outside monitoring, which I understand is my sin to bear. But, usually, the ONLY part about that that is smooth is that once I finally get an appointment (my local clinic is near impossible to make an appointment with), they usually fax over the results promptly. 

I had ultrasound and bloodwork yesterday. My local clinic faxed it over to my current clinic. Apparently, the fax machine at my current clinic broke or whatever. This triggers me because... why the fuck are we still using fax for everything. It's fucking 2019. But regardless, the next problem comes in that my current clinic waited until 2PM to tell me the fax machine broke. Okay, whatever. I call my local clinic and leave a voicemail, asking for the results to be faxed to a secondary clinic. The local clinic never does this or calls back.

So my current clinic says they'll give the local clinic a call ""tomorrow"" (i.e. today) and just arbitrarily keeps me on lupron. I check in with them at 12PM the next day and ask if they got the results. They email me back at 4:45PM saying they called and didn't get the results. What the fuck dude? Why wouldn't they tell me this? Why would they wait four hours and until the end of the day to tell me this?

So I guess I'm just randomly staying on lupron for another extra fucking day. 

I've never had to deal with any other health issues, but is it always like this? Are health institutions always so nonchalant? So unorganized? This process is already so soul-crushing and demoralizing. Why do I have to spend so much time cry-yelling at secretaries and nurses?

I secretly suspect that something about infertility being female-centric or emotional (kind of like how wedding vendors basically rob you because of the ""special day"" situation) means inherently bad customer service or something... I don't know.

I've been trolling this community for a while now looking for some answers, as I took a Modern Fertility test a few months back and received a very unexpected AMH level of 0.25. It was so low for my age they made me do a retest, which just confirmed the same result. I finally got in to see a fertility specialist today, and they confirmed I have premature ovarian failure at 28. While I was expecting this news based on my research, it's still just absolutely heart breaking as I am currently single and have always wanted a family of my own. 

That being said, if my genetic tests come back clean, my doctor is guessing it will take at least 3 rounds to get 5 healthy eggs that I can freeze, since he only saw 4 follicles between my two ovaries during the ultrasound.

I did a search of the subreddit on these issues and found lots of posts about migraine that were helpful, but not much about my particular family medical issues.

Basically, I suffer from occasional migraine with aura. Much less frequent in recent years. I may have had one hemiplegic migraine event but it's unconfirmed. 

My mother has had blood clots, a TIA, and a subarachnoid haemorrhage. For these reasons I told my fertility doctor that I'm concerned about taking BCP and the stims meds. He's been pretty dismissive about the risks.

I'm not overweight, I don't smoke, and I drink alcohol very moderately (a glass of wine, maybe once a week). 

ICSI is our only treatment option because of my husband's low count (4 million) and 25% DNA fragmentation.

I'm due to start BCP on Sunday, or skip BCP and start stims in August. Both the birth control and the stims meds seem to be contraindicated for me but my doctor wants to proceed. I'm really anxious now. We obviously want to do IVF but not to the point of risking my life.

Has anyone here had similar medical issues and was okay with stims/ BCP?

Edit: thanks for your input. I really appreciate it. I had a little freakout that it was all impossible when I posted this morning :)

Update: for anyone who may be in a similar situation. I asked to speak to a different doctor at the clinic and immediately she said no way can I take birth control pills with my history.

Hi all, 
I’d like to donate my remaining meds to someone who is paying out of pocket for treatment and meds.

I have 4 75iu menopur vials and 2 unopened 300IU boxes of follistim to give away. The follistim has been in my refrigerator for a year, but they don’t expire until 2020 and 2021. I also have a box of methylprednizone. 

I have the follistim pen and lots of other sharps.

I’m in Long Beach, CA (though I’ll be in San Diego in Wednesday for work). I’d prefer to meet up locally because of the refrigeration, but if no one is available locally this week I will consider shipping.

<p>Hi all, 
I’d like to donate my remaining meds to someone who is paying out of pocket for treatment and meds.</p>

<p>I have 4 75iu menopur vials and 2 unopened 300IU boxes of follistim to give away. The follistim has been in my refrigerator for a year, but they don’t expire until 2020 and 2021. I also have a box of methylprednizone. </p>

<p>I have the follistim pen and lots of other sharps.</p>

<p>I’m in Long Beach, CA (though I’ll be in San Diego in Wednesday for work). I’d prefer to meet up locally because of the refrigeration, but if no one is available locally this week I will consider shipping. </p>

Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.

**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process.

My wife and I have been trying to conceive for 3 years now; I’m 31 and she’s 27. Tried for about 6 months unsuccessfully before looking into our individual health issues. Can’t remember what she had done, ultrasound I’m guessing, but it showed she had a unicornuate uterus. 

After doing my sperm analysis results showed zero sperm in semen we accepted that I might be sterile for some unknown reason. We ordered a chromosomal analysis and a few other labs. Unfortunately I deployed (army) to Afghanistan a few weeks later and didn’t find out the results until I got back. While I was gone we spent $9000 on donor sperm and attempted IUI twice. Both unsuccessful. 

Upon returning, I was told I have mosaic kleinfelters disorder. This prevents most men from ever being able to father children. I never suspected it because I don’t carry any of the physical characteristics and the Army doctors said they never encounter it because the type of men with it don’t usually join the military. After speaking with a genetic counselor I found new hope that I may be able to use my sperm through a procedure called TSE (testicular sperm extraction). We’re going to hang onto the donor sperm in case I have more issues. 

After the failed IUI attempts my wife and I are going with IVF to increase our chances since I cannot produce every month. Problem is, the cost of all this. While we found a great price $11000 in Colorado Springs, it’s still a ton of money to pay out of pocket. My wife and I always talked about having 4 kids and paying that much on our salary (she works as well but we’re not rich by any means) can be crippling. I’m not a fan of conceiving a child while already having a ton of debt. 

Does anyone know of an insurance that covers (at least partially) IVF? Tricare doesn’t at all which was shocking considering some of the things it does cover.

My husband and I (both 32) have been trying to conceive for 4.5 years. The first few years, I lived in blissful ignorance, thinking that it just takes awhile sometimes. Then my best friend got pregnant and a switch flipped in my brain. I am now a crazy person, lol. 

We finally saw a specialist a little over a year ago (the closest one to me is 3 hours away and took over a year to get an initial consult). My AMH was low-ish (at the bottom of the scale) and so I have diminished ovarian reserve (though not as bad as it could be!). Prior to this, I was unexplained, so I was happy for the reason.. if that makes sense. 

I’ve since done 4 medicated cycles and a heavily medicated iui. I responded to the drugs (which was a damn relief), but still no successes. Fertility treatments where I live are not covered in any way and hubby and I are self employed, so no insurance. We’ve decided that instead of doing more IUI ‘s, we are just going to invest our emotions and money into IVF. I am an “awfulist” (word I learned on this thread and related to, lol), so I am ALREADY gearing up for the failure, even though we aren’t doing IVF until Sept/Oct (we are moving house on Sept 4 and I am easily stressed)

After that insane ramble (sorry!), is there any advice that y’all can give to prep my body in the next few months? I am already taking pre natal, coq10, vitamin d, b and c as per the specialist instructions.

She was given clomid to try to get things going. It took 2 months after the last dose to see any kind of bleeding that lasted about 6 days. It disappeared then came back with heavy clotting that lasted about 1 hr then disappeared for a day then clotting for about 1 hour repeatedly for about 2 weeks. It seemed to be triggered by activities like walking around Walmart for a few hours and long periods of sitting.  Most recently there'd only be 1 large clot randomly then stop for the day and Now it has stopped for the last 3 days we are just waiting for it to do a surprise attack... <_< >_> 


Symptoms/diagnosis'/details 

-Extremely irregular periods like none in years before clomid
-PCOS
-Endometriosis 
-diabetes type 2
-has had blighted ovums in the past
-has had miscarriages in the past
-about 280lbs
-5'11""
-no stomach pain 
-no cramping 
-extreme fatigue (so much sleeeeping 17+hr a day)
-Weaknesses 
-nausea (pretty resent symptom) 
-Breast and nipple sensitivity 
-extreme arousal
-lower back issues 


She recently started a higher does of metformin right before the clomid.

I have no idea whats going on. 
Pregnancy tests are all but useless for her chemical imbalanced body. The internet just confuses us more.

At my first ultrasound scan, baseline, the technician mentioned that my left ovary was harder to see than the right one and she found herself physically pushing down on my stomach to get it to pop into view. She eventually did get a good image of it and my AFC was 25 on that ovary (PCOS and 22 years old)

I asked her if my hard to reach ovary would make IVF difficult and she said she couldn’t answer my questions as that was for the consultant but in her expert opinion my ovaries WERE ‘accessible’ 

I saw the consultant a week later who had no concerns about the wandering ovary and said from what he could see on the copies of the scan my ovaries were accessible but the left one was ‘definitely more fuzzy so it’s probably higher up’ He said this could be due to my weight (I’m pretty big due to the PCOS) or sometimes ovaries just move around occasionally. I’ve had several other ultrasounds at different clinics and all of them found my ovaries with no issue so maybe this was a one off. 
I don’t know if I entirely believe a wandering ovary can be caused by an increased weight however, as I’ve seen most clinics in America will treat ladies up to a BMI of 40. My clinics cut off point is 35 and my BMI is 33.8. 

So now I’ve got the mad fear within me that my ovaries will go MIA during egg retrieval. What happens if this is the case? Would the cycle be cancelled? I’m part of a shared risk program so I’ve no idea.  We’ve prepaid for 2 cycles with a 75% refund if I don’t get pregnant.

On 07/31/19 I underwent surgery for parathyroid exploration/parathyroidectomy. A large tumor was removed and sent to pathology. Results: benign! But it was approximately 2” and weighed 5 grams. 😲 My calcium levels are spiking in both directions- first few days they went really low and I was put on calcitrol, and now the calcitrol has made it too high and I’m back to being hypercalcemic 🤷‍♀️ Just hoping for some relief soon. Wanted to thank all of you for the good thoughts and give you my latest.

✌️ ❤️ 



Hey everyone. I sorta dropped off the face of the earth in April after my second embryo transfer implanted then quickly ended. I thought it was the end of the road, but soon later we found out that our insurance now covers $15k for fertility treatments. So, game on? Or so we thought. I wanted to stick with my plan to lose weight and get my headspace clear before we jumped in again. The good: I’ve lost almost 30lbs since the end of April. But now I’ve been thrown into a different shitstorm. So for all of you doctors, researchers, scientists, generally curious people....this is for you.

The FNP at my Dr’s practice runs the weight loss program. The day after my RE called with the confirmation that I had a chemical/early mc, I made myself an appointment for the following week. After a month of absolutely zero weight loss, she ordered a complete workup. 

Insulin, normal. A1c, low. CBC, normal. Lipids, high cholesterol (normal for me). Metabolic panel- calcium level critically high at 14.8, a/g ratio high. Magnesium, normal. Phosphorus, low.

Next my parathyroid levels were checked and the results with PTH, intact at 481 pg/ml (range 15-65). Calcium confirmed at 14.8.

She wanted a third calcium recheck for some idiotic reason but it was the same. No one would tell me what any of this meant while I’m getting all of these red-flagged results either. Thankfully infertility has taught me that no one else is going to advocate for your health except for yourself, and since we’ve been programmed to take info into our own hands, a quick internet search led me to easily diagnose myself with Hyperparathyroidism, Hypercalcemia and possibly parathyroid cancer.

I found a board certified endocrinologist surgeon in my area and actually in network 🙌. I sent the labs I had results for to initiate an appointment since it was around the 4th and didn’t want to wait another week for the nurse to give me the same results and zero information except to “drink water”. So if you’re reading this far and don’t know what I mean; calcium levels at 14.8 are extremely elevated and dangerous levels that could cause seizures, coma, and organ failure. The fact that they’re this high and I’m still able to function means that I’ve had to have had it a long time since my body has adjusted.

Today I saw the specialist and confirmed with an ultrasound (of all things) that I have a 33mm tumor on one of my parathyroid glands that is wrapped around my esophagus and thyroid. And I have a nodule on my thyroid. There could be more that can’t be seen, but she told me that she thinks it’s likely cancer due to my levels and imaging. Surgery is scheduled for the end of this month, then if pathology confirms, I will have a second procedure to remove the half of my thyroid the tumor had been touching. Other treatments depend on bloodwork, etc.. My heart could be damaged, kidneys, brain, bones, pretty much everything. But surgery is mostly successful and the only cure if it’s an adenoma or localized. Quality of life quickly improves, and I can’t wait to find out what that means.

I wonder why my calcium levels were never checked before or overlooked. High blood calcium transfers to the fetus, basically making it toxic and results in miscarriage. If this is the reason why I’ve had 3 mc and 2 cp, endless implantation failures and no diagnosis, i will probably never sleep well at night. Just because it’s only commonly suspected in post menopausal women over the age of 50, an entire analysis should be done in every case when seeing a reproductive endocrinologist, if not in any other setting. I don’t know if we will try again after this. I do plan on sending this info to my RE and have a conversation about it when my treatment is done. I’ve had the same symptoms since I was in my twenties and I finally feel like my life is about to do a 360.

If anyone has any experience with hypercalcemia and Hyperparathyroidism, please reach out! I couldn’t find a single post about it relating to infertility (except for scientific journals that are a little too clinical for me to read straightforward).

I'm in the northeastern United States and am using a clinic that is said to be the best in my area. Yet throughout the ER cycle I've just finished, we had one consultation with the RE (sales pitch at the beginning), then he showed up once or twice to do ultrasounds (the rest of the time it was nurses who weren't always very good/gentle!).

&#x200B;

All of this was okay, but after everyone in the clinic being quite bouncy and optimistic about my 12-15 follicles in the final monitoring session, I had a devastating egg retrieval, which I did post about in the dailies. All but four of the follicles were empty, with just clear fluid inside. Just two were mature, only one fertilized. It's day 2 and our hopes are l-o-w.

The doc who did the ER wasn't my primary doctor, and he was so lovely. He went out and spoke to my partner in the waiting room while I was still out of it with anesthesia. She said he looked devastated, totally shocked and almost on the verge of tears by the outcome. She was very affected by his compassion as well as his clear professionalism. By contrast, through the cycle, our doc has been off-hand, dismissive, made a couple of really off-color jokes about lesbians hating men while the ultrasound wand was inside me, and so on. (He won an award in our state for ""most compassionate"" RE sometime in the last couple of years??!!) We haven't heard from him since the ER on Wednesday morning at 8.

&#x200B;

So, with $20K down the drain for something that admittedly, is clearly not the clinic's fault, is it unrealistic to think I might hear something from my doctor? It's been two days, and honestly, I thought there would be a ""next steps"" phone call, or something to check in, or whatever. It just kind of sucks to have this incredibly rare thing happen (we have been doing a deep dive in the medical literature as well as searching this sub) and not to have any contact at all from the clinic. To me, it feels like neglect and indifference. It's so much fucking MONEY, would a phone call kill him? Is he worried about us being litigious? What the fuck is UP, man?

&#x200B;

The odds of our one little embryo surviving are so bad, given that  the rest of the crop was such a dud. Let alone being PGS normal (we decided to biopsy if it makes it). Maybe they want to wait until we have certainty that we'll be going in for another round?

&#x200B;

Being an avid lurker here and reading the range of people's experience, I feel that maybe there are a lot of people getting a higher standard of service than we are: access to their ultrasound results online (as opposed to not even giving numbers verbally unless really prodded), regular consults and conversations with the doctor rather than nurses, more respectful sharing of the rationale for protocols, etc. But this could be unrealistic on my part.

<p>I&#39;m in the northeastern United States and am using a clinic that is said to be the best in my area.

My husband is WOEFULLY undeducated. He cannot answer the following questions: Where in a woman's body does fertilization take place? How long after ovulation can you detect pregnancy? When does an egg implant in the uterus? What is a fertilized egg called? What is a blastocyst?

He has, so far, refused to learn. He simply makes me regurgitate basic biological information over and over, so not only am I struggling, but I am forced to teach (and CONSTANTLY DEBATE ABOUT) basic reproduction to a thirty five year old man. I feel like I don't have a partner. Some days, I wish I could just ask him to give me his sperm and GTFO.

<p>My husband is WOEFULLY undeducated. He cannot answer the following questions: Where in a woman&#39;s body does fertilization take place? How long after ovulation can you detect pregnancy? When does an egg implant in the uterus? What is a fertilized egg called? What is a blastocyst?</p>

<p>He has, so far, refused to learn. He simply makes me regurgitate basic biological information over and over, so not only am I struggling, but I am forced to teach (and CONSTANTLY DEBATE ABOUT) basic reproduction to a thirty five year old man. I feel like I don&#39;t have a partner. Some days, I wish I could just ask him to give me his sperm and GTFO.</p>

<p>Anyone else been through this? What did you do? Does anyone have any decent podcasts I can ask him to listen to on his hour long commute? I&#39;m losing my ish over here...</p>

I've had two miscarriages, no live births, both resulting in a D&C. The first one was last year in July and it was a blighted ovum so hard to date but they told me about 5 weeks is probably when it stopped growing. The second was in February at about 7 weeks. (We saw a heartbeat flicker on this one) We are seeing an obgyn and a RE. The second loss was tested for chromosomal abnormalities and everything came back normal. We've had countless tests done all blood work, semen analysis, egg reserves, DNA sequencing (on me) all came back normal. The only thing abnormal is my uterine fibroids the largest one being about 5 cm. He said I have lots of them all over but didn't count, and I have what they called a bicornate uterus. It had a slight indent at the top, making it heart shaped when I had the HSG test. They said this could be a birth defect or be a fibroid pushing on my uterus making it distort. They also did a hysteroscopy and it all looked smooth, no fibroids directly in the uterine cavity. I'm assuming they'll recommend surgery if it is the fibroid from my googling. I'm pretty sure the fibroid is the culprit since having a bicornate uterus itself is not known to cause early miscarriages.   


**Question:**  
The nurse at the fertility clinic called me today to schedule a treatment plan with the doctor but it's a month out and she told us to go ahead and try to conceive this month, but I'm obviously terrified of having another miscarriage. Do we even have a chance of not miscarrying if we do get pregnant? I've been googling and it seems like the most likely answer is that the embryos keep attaching to the fibroid distorted part of my uterus and can't get enough blood flow. I'm assuming we have a shot if it implants somewhere else, but are the odds even worth trying? Another miscarriage would destroy me emotionally, but I also don't want to pass up an opportunity to have a healthy baby.

I got an ultrasound done in April and they saw that only one ovary was polycystic and the other is not, but the ‘normal’ ovary has a large cyst (4.7cm) in it. This concerned the doctor so he asked me to do some blood tests.

My cycles have always been slightly irregular (31-36 days) but I’ve never skipped a period so I just assumed I would be ovulating. Got the blood test results today that my progesterone levels on CD20 were 0.3 which means that I don’t ovulate. I’m quite devastated about this as I didn’t see it coming at all and feels pointless having to go through my period when it’s not actually doing anything.

Weirdly, all my other PCOS blood tests came back in the normal range (FSH, LH, Haemoglobin A1c and 17-Beta Oestradiol), which I was not expecting.

My doctor is now recommending a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy to decrease the size of the cyst. I’m so confused. I was expecting complications due to PCOS and that I would go on metformin/clomid but now have been recommended surgery.

&#x200B;

I've casually been lurking this sub for a year or so but after my appointment at our fertility clinic this morning, I figured it was time to actively join in.

I'm a 31-year-old woman. My husband is 34. We have been TTC since February 2012. It's been a lot of ups and downs. A lot of very dark days. A lot of tears. Depression. Anxiety. You name it.

My husband has a spinal cord injury as a result of a truck accident in 2009. He was 24, I was just 21. We were not notified that having a SCI would affect his sperm quality/quantity in the hospital after his accident. Had we known this, we would have had sperm extracted **ASAP** after his accident.

We requested a referral to a fertility clinic in 2012. We finally got an appointment in 2013 and begin our first few ICSI cycles in 2014. We did three fresh ICSI cycles that year. Two resulted in early MCs. One was canceled entirely post ER as I had reacted poorly to the stims and my eggs were riddled with holes. After our third cycle, our RE told us my husband's sperm quality was too poor, that he had almost zero sperm to begin with. I asked him then if there was something we could do to help the quality and THEN he told us there are supplements he can go on. WTF would you not have put him on the supps BEFORE we started all of our ICSI cycles if his sperm quality was that bad? *\*rage intensifies\**

We needed to take a break from fertility treatments. I was SO pissed off at the clinic and ourselves for not requesting he use supplements.

I can't even remember how long we took off, now. Maybe a year? We spoke with a naturopath. My husband was put on supplements for sperm health.

And, you know what? They HELPED. When we went back to the clinic in 2016, our RE was surprised that my hubby had a normal sperm count (from almost 0!). He said we could probably get pregnant at home by ourselves but we decided to do IUI instead. We did two IUI but my hubby's sperm quality was too poor post-wash.

Took another year off.

In 2017, we did ONE more ICSI. Surely, the 4th ICSI cycle would right, right?

Nope.

Negative, again.

The RE said we shouldn't continue with ICSI anymore. My egg quality was never that great from all the stims, anyway.

I was totally broken.

**Enter 2019.**

My husband is now willing to look at sperm donation as a route for us. So, here we are. We had an appointment today and our RE was excited to see us again. He thinks using a sperm donor is a great idea. We have an appointment with a Reproductive Counsellor next week and I'm just waiting for my period to come so I can go get another HSG.

It's bittersweet to be ""back"" on the ART wagon. We've been TTC at home since 2017 to no avail. Using ART is probably our only chance to have a little one. So I am hesitant to be excited about starting this again ...but here I am.

(Cause the labor is happening anyway.)

Let’s start with what is a disability? I believe WHO has the best definition.

*Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. Disability is thus not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.*
— **World Health Organization**

WHO nails it. Now, I ask you to take a good look at infertility and consider if infertility is a disability. I would posit it is.

Now, whatever emotional response you’re having, consider that for a moment too.

Do you feel broken? Do you feel shamed for not being “normal”? Do you feel like your failing? Do you feel seen? Do you feel like, “shit, no wonder this is so hard”? Do you feel like this is unfair? Do you feel like, “oh no I’m not disabled”?

All of those responses are reasonable and appropriate, but few of them are true or logical. Your *value* as a person is not determined by your function or production. 

**Your value as a person is not determined by your function or production.**

I’m a disabled person. I was before infertility (assuming it’s not related to my other illnesses and issues) and I will be after. I choose to own this group of humans, always. I have always had a disability (which for sake of clarity is not the same as claiming “disabled” as an identity).

I have stood in coffee shops and been told by social acquaintances of Libertarian leaning that my existence was merely a ”suck on social resources”. I have been told, repeatedly, that I shouldn’t want or have kids. I am discriminated against by adoption agencies. I am discriminated against by my own family and society. I have gone through treatment after treatment, some helped more then others, and in the end be told “we don’t really know why that happened or why this treatment worked.” 

All before infertility was a thing I face head on. I was infertile in the eyes of society. In fact, in some states Medicaid will cover sterilization of any FEMALE who qualifies as disabled by the state. People like me shouldn’t have kids, says the state.

My disability, at its most severe, has socially isolated me, made me unable to leave my home on my own, laid me on bed rest, restricted my choices, had me taking handfuls of medications and supplements every day, made me gain weird amounts of weight in weird places that I can’t seem to get rid of. I have experienced invasive procedures, rough exams, dismissive doctors - “just relax, it’s probably just stress”. I have had to change my diet, or face the consequences. I have had to limit alcohol, never smoke, avoid illicit drugs, take drugs that are sold illicitly but my doctor prescribed. 

That’s the disability experience. 

It’s also the disability experience to have access to treatment or simply suffer, to fight with insurance people, wonder if this treatment is doing more harm then good, to wonder who to tell and who not to, to not be able to receive the treatment you need to resolve a problem because it costs thousands of dollars and insurance won’t pay for it. To have to move or travel to be able to access treatment, or afford treatment. To be socially ostracized. To be made other.

I would also ask you to look at your feelings from earlier and wonder what you have been taught about disability that makes it so distressing for you to identify with. (It is still, at times, distressing for me, and I’ve chosen disabled as my own identity for decades. In no way is this easy.) 

I’m not judging anyone. I have spent at least 15 years of my life, daily questioning what are my own expectations and what are societies. Spent so much time in my life wondering what and how much to disclose to whom. I spent years in therapy asking myself what my value was as a person if I couldn’t have kids, if I couldn’t work, if I couldn’t make. I am compassionate towards my younger self and any human who has to walk their way through the bramble of expectation society puts on women. I’m still dealing with thorns and scars from those things.

Health, too, is a nebulous thing to define or explain. I am disabled. I am healthy. I am both, but I have at times not been healthy. But these words are intertwined.

What happens for me, when another person dealing with infertility says “all I want is a healthy baby” is “all I want is a baby not like you.” They don’t want a child who will have to face challenges, struggle, fight insurance and survival, get procedures, have pity heaped on them. I get *that*. 

However, I hear, because people and society has told me in no uncertain terms, that I am not valuable because I have had these specific problems. 

If you don’t think you can parent well a child with disability or health challenges, that’s totally okay. I have many friends who parents have made their disability all about themselves and it causes great harm. Say, “I don’t think I can parent an unhealthy child.” And I will be there for you.

I also want to note here - children get sick. Sometimes not for years, and occasionally, a child will make it to adulthood without serious disease - but eventually they are likely to face one. Humans are fragile animals. Do I think we shouldn’t wish extra ill will on children? Yes, however we also have to accept we’re having humans and humans break down.

My in-laws assume we will adopt because of my health issues. So does much of society. They deem my genetics not good enough. They deem me not good enough. If we manage to have a biological & genetic child, they will likely have ADHD, allergies, at least 1 MTHFR gene and possibly EDS & 1 CFS gene. My children may never be “healthy” by anyone else’s standards, and I am okay with that. I’m *fine* with that. Many others are not. But I know I can parent a child with these things and give them a better life then I have had. I can access treatment and supports and give them a life with fewer challenges then mine.

Isn’t that what every parent wants to give their kids? 

These are complex social issues and I can not distill into one conversation all the things I wish people knew. If you wish to learn more about disability and it’s supports and advocates, I will happily share. I’m close friends with many such people and support their work.

If you have read all this, thank you. It has really helped me to clarify what I need to address tomorrow night. If this has made you think, awesome. 

If this has made you angry at me, please keep it to yourself - I’ve probably heard it before and I already know people think people like me are a problem. If this has made you angry at society - you’re on the right track. Even just being more thoughtful will help ease the social burden.",t2_1rjwqfp1,False,,0,False,"Disability, infertility, and “I just want a healthy baby.”",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_cdyjvi,False,dark,0.82,,public,49,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,49,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1563319721.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I have spoken over the last week about disability and space, respect and hurt, in the dailies.

I have been trying for years without success. I never had my progesterone level measured before a month ago. Today, I got back the results. Everything's normal except my progesterone.

I was on depo from 15-19. I since have been informed that I do not meet the criteria for that diagnosis. I am 28 years old now and have regular cycles, my LH and FSH are totally normal. My AMH is 2.4. I have been trying for years without success. I never had my progesterone level measured before a month ago. Today, I got back the results. Everything&#39;s normal except my progesterone. In the follicular phase it was 0.6 and in the luteal phase, it was 0.7. I never had a spike. I have just been started on progesterone for days 14-28 for the next 3 months. 
I see so many women on this page who are doing IUI or IVF. I never made it that far. I don&#39;t know if this is the answer but I don&#39;t understand how something so vital could&#39;ve been overlooked for so long. 
I also wonder if this lack of progesterone could be caused by the depo I took for so long years ago,as I was going through adolescence. Maybe my body never produced it because of the depo. I don&#39;t really know.

(also, I'm an active member of this sub, not a drive-by rando.)

So, my husband found out he has CBAVD (he was born with a vasectomy) and that's why we're doing IVF, but he never had any CF symptoms prior to this.  Nothing that was even borderline.  He almost never even gets colds, let alone respiratory infections, and no digestive problems.  Not even one case of cystic fibrosis in his family.  So naturally cystic fibrosis mutations were not on our mind when trying to conceive.

Anyway, we got sperm through PESA, so that's great, but my concern is what this means for his health.  He has two mutations (compound heterozygote) but neither are the common disease-causing ones you can find on Google.  One is some random one I've never heard of (even through googling I found nothing) and the other is a variant of unknown significance.  Our RE told us he's just a carrier, and outside of CBAVD there's no need to treat anything related to his health.  her words were ""The combination of these mutations only leads to infertility, not cystic fibrosis.""  The RN echoed this and told us as long as he sees his regular GP once a year, nothing else we should be doing.  His asked his regular GP and he said he wasn't worried and did not recommend going to a CF clinic.  The only thing they said is that we should make sure I'm not a carrier (which I'm not.)

Maybe this is because I'm nearing the end of stims and estrogen tends to make me pretty emotional and anxious, but I've attempted to play Dr. Google and started trying to find information on his mutations.  I found nothing, because apparently they're super rare, but I did find some troubling studies on compound heterozygotes being at increased risk of other health problems later on in life.  However, these studies almost always focus on the common F508 deletion, which I don't believe he has, and because all of this is pretty rare, I'm at the point where every link is purple and I prob need to step away.

Anyway, anyone else dealing with a similar diagnosis, is your partner changing anything about his lifestyle or undergoing treatments outside of PESA/TESE/mTESE?  My husband enjoys vaping weed, and I've been a little concerned about how that could affect his lungs, if he does actually have cystic fibrosis, but our assigned RN at the fertility clinic told us she doesn't think that's a problem if he's not actually smoking.

For background, I have just started my second IVF cycle and am 35 years old, AMH 0.9, FSH ~7, AFC 10 with “borderline” DOR. Husband tested normal for standard semen analysis. My first IVF cycle resulted in 12 ER, 9 mature, 7 fert, 2 blasts (D5 and D7), 1 pgs normal embryo (the D5 one). I did a microflare lupron protocol. 

For the second cycle that I am supposed to be starting now, they are switching me to a stop lupron protocol. So far, the main difference seems to be the lupron dosage, which is 1/4 what it was with the microflare, only administered 1x per day, and overlaps some with bcp and stops once the stims begin. I have had about a week delay starting because my estrogen has been higher than they’d like — I had this problem with the last protocol too but it didn’t go on for as long bc apparently it needs to be really quite low before I start this protocol (I assume, because the lupron then stops). They are “holding me” on the low dose lupron this time instead of bcp until it goes down.

Anyway, I have asked why we switched to this protocol and what difference (quality, quantity, both) they are expecting to see with the switch, but the answers I have been getting just sound like a lot of spit-balling (“some protocols work better than others.”) I know that is true, but I’d like to understand more.

(I shared this on the endo page, but it was recommended I try here for insight)

I'm wondering if anyone here has any insight for me on this. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 3 1/2 years. We saw a standard OBGYN at first followed by a RE. PCOS runs in my family, so the workup by both parties was mainly focused on ruling that out. I do not have PCOS, my HSG showed my tubes were open, and my lab work was all normal. My cycles have always been irregular, so I was diagnosed with ovulatory dysfunction of unknown etiology and basically told that we had unexplained infertility.  We tried oral medications on and off for around a year and a half (Clomid followed by Letrozole, followed by Letrozole plus trigger) but didn't conceive. We are Catholic, and didn't feel that IVF/IUI was the right option for us (no judgement if you're an IVF warrior!), so we decided to hang up our hats on trying to conceive and started saving up to start the adoption process. 

Around 3 months ago, in the middle of the night, I developed this insane abdominal pain. Literally, worst pain of my life. We went to the ER thinking I had a ruptured appendix and it turns out I had a baseball sized endometrioma on my right ovary. I got set up with a great OBGYN (different than the last one) who scheduled me for a cystectomy and a diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm her suspicion that I probably had advanced endometriosis. Turns out I have stage III endo all over. She was able to remove the endometrioma (saving my right ovary) and did an ablation to what other lesions she could, but I had lesions on my left fallopian tube and in my posterior cul de sac (rectal area) that she couldn't ablate. I know that exicision is the gold standard as far as endo surgery, but they were really concerned  the endometrioma was going to cause an ovarian torsion. No  specialists are in-network with my insurance, which is why we treated locally vs going with an excision specialist. 

I have my first post op follow up with my OBGYN next week. She'd mentioned previously that she thought it was going to be a good idea to put me on Lupron for 6 months post op, to 'starve out' whatever endo tissue is left and to hopefully prevent or delay recurrence of that endometrioma coming back. My main symptom with this endometriosis has been infertility - I have always had painful periods but they are manageable with over the counter medications. My main goal with treatment of this endometriosis is to conceive naturally without IVF/IUI. I was on the pill for the 10 years before I got married, and never had issues with painful periods, or other hallmark endo sypmtoms. If I didn't want to conceive, I'd just request to go back on oral birth control, but given the circumstances, I understand the rationale for her recommendation to try Lupron. I've done some research on the Nancy's Nook facebook page and have seen some pretty concerning stuff as far as side effects and long term effects with Lupron. Has anyone had any luck as far as conceiving after being put on Lupron short term? The research seems to be all over the place, and I'm just looking for some guidance from some other endo sisters who have maybe walked this path before. This whole situation has thrown me for a loop, and I’m just feeling a bit overwhelmed and lost. Any insight (good or bad) is welcome!

We are new members and this is our first post, please forgive us if we break any rules (we did read them)!

We were hoping to get some feedback from the community about protocols that worked for women with diminished ovarian reserve (low AMH values) on the female side and low morphology and high DNA fragmentation on the sperm side.

A little background-we are 38-I have low AMH value (0.76 ng/ml) and elevate FSH (12.68-just last year this value was 6!).

My husband has 2% morphology, high dna fragmentation (47%), and low motility.

First IVF cycle was in 2016 (antagonist protocol-no ICSI) where 12 eggs were retrieved, 11 were mature, 7 fertilized, and only 2 made it to freeze. Both of those ended in miscarriage due to chromosomal abnormalities. I had stimmed for 12 days (longer than they expected).

Second IVF cycle was in April-May 2019 (antagonist protocol-with ICSI). I stimmed for 14 days. Four eggs were retrieved, all four mature, none fertilized.

Third IVF cycle was in May-June 2019 (microdose protocol with ICSI). I stimmed for 18 days!! Nine eggs were retrieved, four were initially mature, with only 1 fertilizing. Three additional ones matured over night in the lab, they did not fertilize. The one that did fertilize made it to Day 6 freeze and was sent for PGS testing. Unfortunately it had an additional chromosome 14 and 21 :(

My Doctor recommends donor eggs but is willing to try one more cycle of IVF with my eggs but with a different protocol- clomid plus injectables and no ICSI (which is confusing due to Male factor issues).

Questions:

Has anyone tried the clomid plus fewer injectables IVF protocol and have it work?

Has anyone with similar issues to us tried a different protocol that worked?

What supplements to take to fix egg quality? My Doctor did not recommend DHEA and said that diet won't make much of a difference either (I can't say I agree with this).

Little back story. Wife and I have been married since 2016 and started trying roughly a year a later. We have officially been trying for 24 months and have had no luck. We have both been tested as much as we can and all the Doctors can tell us is that we are healthy as can be. We just have unexplained infertility. We took a few months off to think about our options coming up. We decided to do IUI this month. We are not super ovulating because we are terrified of having twins. So we are just forcing ovulation of one egg. My wife will get the shot tonight (Saturday 11pm) and our appointment is Monday 8:30am. I am still a little bit worried we are going to miss our window and it will be wasted time and money. Wife did a ovulation test last night before bed (around 1030) and it came up that she would be ovulating soon. Those test kits usually say what? within 24-36 hrs you will be ovulating. I am nervous this whole IUI thing will be AFTER she has ovulated and we miss the very small window to fertilize the egg but hey, this is what our doctor said.  
  
IUI is probably our only shot. My wife is complete against IVF at this point in time. I am trying to talk with her in getting on board with it if IUI fails, but she is just completely against it right now because it costs SO MUCH MONEY and still isn't guaranteed to work.

I did it for 2 days and I started to feel like this was torture because I find Gatorade just SO sweet and when I looked at the coconut water nutrition label it was just as sweet.

So I made up my own electrolyte and anti-constipation brew, which is based on the scientifically proven Oral Rehydration Solution discussed here https://rehydrate.org/:

1 liter water (don’t drink more than 1 liter of this recipe per day due to the addition of the psyllium husk)

3 rounded teaspoons of CVS brand orange-flavored psyllium husk, which I think is equivalent to Metamucil.

3 level tablespoons of sugar

1/4 level teaspoon of Morton lite salt (which has some potassium chloride instead of just sodium chloride, but if you don’t have, regular table salt is fine)

1/4 level teaspoon table salt.

Mix/dissolve well and the orange flavor of the Metamucil stuff makes I taste pretty decent!

I have also been pouring a separate 12oz glass of this brew and mixing with a capful if Miralax once a day.  I don’t mix it into the full liter because I want to make sure I get the full dose regardless of how much overall brew I drink.

&#x200B;

Sad to be here, but so thankful for you guys already. My husband and I are 29/30, and have been married about 2.5 years now. He was diagnosed with idiopathic hypogonadotrpic hypogonadism when he was a young teenager -- his body doesnt make FSH and LH naturally at all, and he never went though puberty until starting TRT injections. The glass-half-full side is that we've both known and accepted from day 1 of our relationship that we would need assistance if there was ever a chance of conceiving. Additionally, we're both in the medical field, which makes getting access to and understanding the pathophysiology of his disease and treatment options a bit easier, but sometimes it also makes me way more obsessive and anxious. 

&#x200B;

About 6 months ago we decided we were ready to TTC, and met with a reproductive urologist. He got his first SA and even though we knew in our hearts what the result would be, it was still gut wrenching to see ""azoospermia"" on the report. He started my hubby on HCG injections, which hopefully will start the process of him making his own testosterone and possibly sperm. Unfortunately, the fact that he was on TRT for so long is just another hurdle, which could delay things even more. 

&#x200B;

Our ""plan"" the the RU gave us was to do HCG injections for about 6-9 months, then possibly add in FSH for another 1-2 years. Only then could we know for sure if my husband is able to make his own sperm, and thennnn we could possibly start the process of IVF vs decide on trying TESE or going for donor sperm. He is going to do blood work and SAs every 3 months. So basically we're in the middle of an incredibly expensive, anxeity-provoking, and heartbreaking waiting game while I watch my entire instagram feed post pregnancy announcements.

So how do your docs know if you ovulated for sure, if your progesterone comes back less than 10 on day 21? Does that mean you didn’t ovulate even though ovidrel is supposed to released those eggs? 

I’ve asked my doc about why some practices use an ultrasound when inserting the Inuterine insemination and why some don’t. The answer was that not everyone needs guidance in inserting the catheter to the uterus. But wouldn’t it be great to know the size of the follicles with in minutes of the procedure too?

3. Proceed to Very painful ER. But 6 eggs retrieved.

4. Saline Scans reveal possible uterine septum (previously told I have a text book uterus...) and/or hyperplasia.  

// Scared, anxious, pressure, what do we do, how can I make my body safe for our future baby?

But Lab says Sperm and eggs look great! 
No need for ICSI proceed with normal IVF.

I pretty much assumed that I had a fatty liver since I'm diabetic, but I eat basically keto and have an excellent a1c (5.5) so I didn't expect an enlarged spleen too.

Backstory: diagnosed diabetic October 2016 with a1c 10.7 and BG 478.  By May of 2017 I had an a1c of 5.4 with changes to diet and exercise and the addition of metformin.  I don't have baseline ultrasounds for liver and spleen from that time.  Husband and I got married in August of 2017, and have been trying to conceive since January 2018 with no success.  In May I was given several meds for weight loss that gave me abdominal pain and other problems features after losing 20 pounds in 20 days.  Discontinuing them and the abdominal pain went away.  My a1c crept up a bit, so I went low carb in January and started a bunch of supplements for pregnancy, and the abdominal pain returned.  It has been a steady low-grade abdominal pain since then.  In April we started medicated cycles of progesterone/letrozole.  And last week I finally got an abdominal ultrasound for the abdominal pain, when they diagnosed me with hepatosplenomegaly most likely secondary to fatty liver.  I've been losing weight consistently and slowly since March.  I see a GI next Friday, and it will be up to them whether they ""pass me"" so I can continue treatment, but even if they do, we'll have missed my fertile window (ugh) so I'll have to start again with progesterone and wait 45 days to be back where I am today.

I honestly don't get why people who are annoyed about being judged for their reproductive choices are so judgy about ours, but whatever.  Because it's reddit, which has a huge childfree population, I regularly see ridiculously rude comments about IVF.  Within the same week, I saw one poster post the birth of his baby through IVF and he got tons of upvoted comments lambasting him for not ""just adopting.""  Then, another poster posted his baby that was conceived naturally and nobody asked him why he didn't just adopt.

On the IVF post, when someone pointed out to the ""just adopt"" people that a baby can cost $50K, their response was ""Oh, so selfish, why do you need a healthy baby when you can have a 10 year old with fetal alcohol syndrome for free.""  Like, come on.  You're expecting that any infertile person MUST adopt a seriously disabled older child experiencing trauma, lest they be ""selfish""?  Also the expenses of taking care of a child with severe issues are going to pile up so it's not free.  And what about the sadness when that child potentially dies young, or can't connect with you, or (insert other horrible scenario that's far more likely to happen with a special needs traumatized child through foster care).  I'm sure those people haven't adopted anyone let alone a special needs kid.

I've even see childfree people say that people who are upset about not having a baby (and in their opinion, it's incredibly entitled to want a healthy baby let alone a baby who is biologically related to you) are like people who are upset about not getting a sports car.  Sure, if 90% of people in the world had a free sports car, and the world revolved around sports cars, and your self worth was based on having a sports car, and people constantly asked you if you had a sports car..what a dumb fucking analogy.

Personally, I have a somewhat large social media following and when I opened up about my IVF, the most ""liked"" comments were calling me a selfish bitch and telling me to adopt- and not JUST adopt- but specifically adopt teenagers and kids with special needs (I'm 29 with zero parenting experience, so I'm sure I'd be a GREAT candidate for that.)

What the fuck is wrong with people?  If it's my duty to adopt a teenager, then isn't it also the duty of fertile people?  Or for that matter, childfree people?  I mean, isn't it ""SELFISH"" to spend all your money on yourself when you could be fostering 5 special needs teenagers??

The funny thing is, my husband and I want to foster LGBTQ teenagers when we're older and already have parenting experience...but right now is not the time for that!  Nobody would even allow us to.  We are NOT equipped for that right now.  Most people who adopt teenagers are, ya know, old enough to actually be the parent of a teenager.

These people are such hypocrites that even adopting isn't enough to satisfy them.  If you're infertile, you MUST adopt teenagers and older special needs kids, otherwise you're selfish.  If you're fertile, just go ahead and have kids, nobody cares.

I honestly don't understand how anyone can justify this.  And as for the fake concern about IVF ""ruining my body,"" I'm literally fine.  I was bloated for like a week and then back to normal.  Pregnancy fucks with your body so much more than IVF does.  I wish people would stop acting like IVF is dipping yourself in radioactive waste.  ""Pumping your body full of hormones"" sounds so dramatic.  The needles are tiny and the hormones are ones your body already makes. You'd do more harm to your body by getting drunk.  

Ugh, sorry to rant like this but I get so mad thinking about this that I  want to punch people.

You'd think infertile people and childfree people would have some common ground- for one, we both hate hearing about other people's kids, lol- but no, apparently we're their enemy despite the fact that we're far less entitled and deluded than your average fertile mom of five Braydens.",t2_3qe72ye1,False,,2,False,What is with childfree people who hate IVF with a burning passion?,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_cbxyi1,False,dark,0.98,,public,312,2,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,312,,False,self,1562865229.0,,[],{'gid_2': 2},,True,,1562892504.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>ETA Thank you for the gold!!!</p>

After calling around it turns out that, yes, the ultrasound would have been covered, but because the diagnosis resulting from said ultrasound (on paper) was infertility, it was denied. I am livid.

I’ve called back and forth between insurance and OB to sort it out, and still no solution. I would NOT  have agreed to the ultrasound had I known it was “infertility treatment”, because I saw the RE 5 days later and they charge 250 for an ultrasound. Why TF would I have needed one at my OBs office. It’s also fucking ridiculous they can’t tell you how much something costs until weeks or months after you agree to services. This is the state of US healthcare and it’s so frustrating.</p>

<p>Ladies who have coverage, count your blessings. For those who don’t, good luck out there. I’m going to push back and keep trying to get this resolved. If anyone has advice for this specific situation I’d love to hear. I’m raging today trying not to take it out on the call center people who are just doing their job on behalf of a major insurance corporation. </p>

2. Is it possible to do a fresh transfer with the long protocol? I worry about my uterine lining after that many days of stims.

282,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"FET question. I have a call this Thursday to talk with my clinic about frozen embryo transfer protocols. 

Here is my dilemma: 

Outside of fertility/hormone treatments, I have a pretty regular cycle (28-32 days, 8-10 day periods, ovulation usually around cycle day 18-21).

In the past, when I have used birth control pills, unless I start them *after* my period has ended (which for me is usually cycle day nine or ten - yeah fun times), I either continue to spot and bleed and sometimes clot either straight through every single day until I have the full hormone withdrawal period (which happens on single phase oral contraceptives); *OR* I have a shortened initial period, then don’t bleed for about a week, then spot and bleed from about cycle day 15 all the way through the end of my cycle/end of my regular withdrawal bleed (which happens on multiphasic oral contraceptives).  

Obviously, either of these patterns won’t work for FET, since I’ll be bleeding out my lining the whole time on oral contraceptives, rather than building my lining with the estrogen and the oral contraceptives (which is what I understand is the point of oral contraceptives as part of an FET prep).

#Has anyone experienced anything similar? 
If so, what did you do to address it?

My RE clinic has the option of a Lupron start, but that seems pretty rough to me to go into basically false menopause for every FET.  Especially since: (1) I’m so close to real menopause (age wise) that is a mindfuck I would like to avoid; (2) when my mom was going through menopause she had absolutely terrible side effects, which I feel like I would likely have as well, and I would obviously like to avoid; (3) my body seems very very set on generating its own hormones, no matter what exogenous hormones are applied, so I think attempting to tamp them down with Lupron might just mess me up more. 

My clinic also has the option of a “natural” FET prep, but it will cost me more (significantly more than I already paid upfront for the otherwise - included FET prep), and it seems to me that they don’t do it very often: they seem to be gently deterring me from doing a “natural” FET prep. And, if they don’t do it very often, I’m not sure I want both of us flying blind.

Any bright ideas? 

ETA: I also crossposted in the daily, but then realized how long this thing is
ETA2: fixed typos for clarity

ETA3: I emailed my clinic to ask what is the purpose of the oral contraceptive pills (timing or something else), and here is their answer: “It’s a little bit of both – the birth control pill does help with timing and scheduling for the transfer, but it also suppresses your ovaries and makes sure no follicles develop so that we can introduce hormones at the appropriate time.”  Hope that’s helpful for anyone following along

A while ago my wife and I (34, cis female, no known fertility issues) decided to
move on after a couple of unsuccessful home inseminations and 8 failed IUIs with frozen sperm. Our RE gave us a good outlook for an IVF cycle and said I would probably react well to the meds. 

We began stimming last week. Yesterday I had my first follicle scan after four days of stimming with 225IU menopur. However, not much had happened. Our doctor had to search for a while and found 2 good follicles and 4 small ones - 6 total. She was not sure whether the small ones would catch up. Also, she was very surprised and could not explain why my ovaries did not react to the menopur. She put me on 300IU menopur (highest dose she would prescribe) and told me to come back for another scan tomorrow. After the appointment I was devastated. The process is so expensive for us (insurance doesn't cover fertility treatment for lesbian/queer women here) and it is not clear if we will have a good number of follicles this time.

What are your experiences? Can a higher dose still yield more follicles? How many follicles should we have for a realistic chance of pregnancy? Our RE's opinion is that you only need one, but I'm not that optimistic. Her argument is that I am still young, but right now it does not feel like that at all. Especially considering all the failed IUIs and the low number of follicles. My antral follicle count this cycle was approx. 9-10, so this is even lower. I asked several times in advance if we would need to run more tests, but the answer was no. They tested my hormones a year ago before the IUIs and did a HSG which was all fine.

Trigger warning: previous pregnancy/subsequent loss discussed for context

&#x200B;

So we did our first, only, last, however you want to look at it, IUI yesterday. We just wanted to give it a try, so thought why not. My husband has/had? lower than average counts, but nothing too low (10 million per ml, with an average sample size of 3.3) good motility, low morphology, but we had success after just having sex twice (which was a loss at 14 weeks) after I had surgery for endometriosis last July - so knew it could happen and thought we would try.

&#x200B;

Anyway, we got there for the IUI and he had been REALLY sick the week leading up - like super sick. he has cyclic neturopenia and it really knocks him around sometimes.

Anyway, so his count only ended up being ONE million. we did it anyway, but dont have a lot of hope and decided to do IVF with ICSI next month. Anyway, just wondered if anyone of a similar ""profile"" i guess, had any input/thoughts/advice/opinions?

About us

Me:

age = 26 & 2 months

issues = endometriosis/overweight but a very healthy lifestyle (don't drink, don't smoke, no caffeine, regular exercise, healthy diet etc)

EDIT: my AMH is 16.7

&#x200B;

my partner:

age = 29 and 9 months

issues = low sperm count and abnormal morphology, motility is good, often can be sick due to cyclic neutropenia

&#x200B;

For the IVF, we will have:

&#x200B;

Elonva 150mcg on day 2

Gonal F 225IU from day 5,6 or 7ish (cant remember exactly when, and they'll tell me exactly when if I get a day 1)

Orgalutan 250MCG from day 6

Ovidrel trigger whenever approproate

&#x200B;

then pregnyl/progesterone pessaries for lutel phase support.

&#x200B;

i guess my biggest fear is that we won't get any embryos.

We have been doing OI/the IUI with medication and I have always ovulated. for this most recent cycle, we did 50iu of puregon daily days 3-11, and a trigger shot day 12, iui day 13. then we have pregnyl for lutel support.",t2_3x0mb7r2,False,,0,False,first and last IUI yesterday - already thinking next steps.,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_cawnz5,False,dark,0.8,,public,3,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},TW: Miscarriage/Loss,False,3,,False,self,1562652700.0,,[],{},,True,,1562679813.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone!</p>

I had a laparotomy in which they cut me from my belly button straight down to remove a mass and infection which I almost died from. When I went into that surgery they told me the may have to remove my left ovary and Fallopian tube - but didn't. Since then I had generally accepted that **THIS** **circumstance** may make it difficult/impossible to get pregnant and carry a baby.

Cut to today, I am single, 35F (36 in August), and was having some anxiety about being in the dating pool not knowing if I could have children or not. I didn't want to take that option away from a man who knew with certainty he wanted kids - because I didn't know if it was possible anyway. So, my MD refers me to a fertility clinic and I have a complete workup done. Just for some peace of mind and to confirm my suspicions.

I had my final results this week and I am a bit shaken. The MD says that the *good news* is that the surgery had almost no impact whatsoever on my ability to conceive and carry a child; very minimal internal scarring, and both my Fallopian tubes are open and working. BUT the MD reports that I have a lower than average egg count for a woman my age and my FSH (hormone) is high. She says my best chance at getting pregnant is by trying *right now.*

I am pretty heartbroken that it may be **THESE circumstances** of my own body and age that may make the decision for me. I felt better to be able to *blame* my fencesitting/potential childfree status on the surgery.

I know I don't want to be a 'single mother by choice' and my financial and social circumstances wouldn't necessarily be ideal for raising a baby right now via sperm donor. - even if it was possible to get pregnant. I don't want to be dating so seriously right now that I am assessing every Tinder date for current fatherhood status. The MD also said I wouldn't be a good candidate for egg freezing because they may not be able to extract enough viable ones for the $10k price tag to be worth it. But I just want more time before I go into early menopause. I don't feel ready for life to make this decision for me.

I was hoping this medical workup would give me more answers to reduce my anxiety, but in fact, it has made the pressure so much worse. Sigh...anyone else been through something similar? How do I deal with this?

I've got my first appointment at the infertility clinic on the 16th July and I'm nervous. My mum's got terminal cancer which has spurred us on with TFAB and after months of nothing happening on the ovulation tests my lovely GP fudged the figures for me to suggest we've been trying for 2 years so I could get bloods done and be referred (we haven't used protection since 2016 but used the pull out method). Bloods showed an anovulatory cycle and my husband has had a SA which showed 'very severe' problems. Great.

So now I'm freaking myself out. I work for the NHS and have seen IVF, it's something I always said I wouldn't have. But now thanks to my knowledge from my job and some reading on the Internet I'm lead to believe Icsi will probably be what's offered. I am terrified about how invasive everything is getting. I'm terrified about how long everything is going to take. I'm terrified my mum won't be here if we ever have a child. I'm terrified how this is all going to effect my marriage. 

I'm trying to make sure that I don't slow anything down. Trying to get my BMI down to 29.9 so there are no excuses. Trying not to get upset by all the pregnant people around me. This sucks.

And to top it all off I'm following a low GI/diabetic diet to try and shed some timber and my husband keeps eating crap in front of me. I might have had a go at him saying that I'm desperately trying for both of us, so that one day maybe we can have a family and him eating crap in front of me isn't helpful.

I’ve lurked here for a while but haven’t posted much yet. I was wondering if anyone who has (or partner has) gone through the TESA/TESE procedure could share what their experiences and results (with the procedure) were. My husband is having the procedure at the end of the month and it’s the first major hurdle we have to clear in this process so I’m getting anxious about it and am hoping hearing others experiences will ease some of that anxiety. I’m worried they won’t be able to retrieve any sperm we can use. 

For a little context, I’m 29 and my husband is 34. Our issue is MFI from cystic fibrosis. Males with CF typically are born without the vas deferens so the IVF/ICSI with TESE is our best path. No known fertility issues with me, although both REs I’ve seen said that I have “polycystic morphology” due to high follicle count (more than 12 on each ovary) and high AMH (6.6), but neither seemed concerned about it impacting treatment.

We managed to get an appointment to see our IVF nurse a week earlier than we should’ve originally seen a week later. 
I’ve been given medication to induce a period and then i start the injections. 

At my appointment, the nurse told me an estimated date for egg retrieval. She said that at my clinic they don’t offer sedation and do the entire process whilst the woman is awake and aware. I’ve never heard of this. Whenever I’ve googled it I’ve always seen that women are put to sleep or heavily sedated in some way. Nope. Not at my clinic. 

The nurse told me they would offer me gas and air during, aswell as a Valium tablet 30 minutes before the procedure. She told me the dosage of the Valium also.
I take Valium anyway occasionally for my anxiety to help me sleep, and let me tell you it barely does anything for me. It certainly won’t calm my nerves for something as scary as egg retrieval. The dosage is the same as what I have at home. It isn’t like they’re giving me a stronger dosage.

My sister in law also had an egg retrieval done without any sedation and she told me it was manageable but pretty painful. She did however say that she’s not great when it comes to pain. My pain tolerance is pretty high but I’ve never had any form of surgery. 
Super annoying because my clinic is one of the only clinics in the UK that doesn’t offer any form of sedation during ER. It almost seems wrong that they don’t offer sedation, surely their priority should be to make the woman as comfortable as possible? Maybe I’m just imagining this to be far more barbaric than what it actually is but I’m absolutely terrified now.
