Prognosis is IVF is only option and husband is extremely resistant to the idea and is working on accepting a child free life. I've tried to talk about it a couple times, but I can tell we are both grieving in very different ways, so I've decided not to push the issue for awhile.

I have however, made an appointment to have a 30 min phone conversation with a clinic about the specifics of donating my eggs and a second opinion appointment with an IVF clinic to confirm that IVF is the ONLY option.  Unfortunately, both appointments are well into the future, so now I wait.

In the mean time, I am still taking my temperature every morning and I'm approaching CD10, when I would usually start using OPKs.  I'm torn between having more information ""just in case"" and ""what's the point"".  Because of the PCOS, I've only ovulated once in the last eight months, which happened to be last month (although it was CD30), so I'm curious if it will happen again.  Plus the denial part of me keeps reminding me that there is a boost to fertility after an HSG, so I should keep trying.  What do you all think?  Do any of you all who have been told IVF is only option still temp and use OPKs? 

We also have a follow up appointment on Monday with the RE who diagnosed me to ask all the questions.  I need to write down all my questions, but I know I want o ask if I should 1) get on metaformin to lower my testosterone, despite my tubes being busted and 2) the nitty gritty of IVF and 3) Donating my eggs.  I think that if my husband can have the mysteries of IVF removed, it might change his mind.  Any specific questions any of you all wish you had asked at one of your early RE appointments that I should ask?

Finally, I am really stuck in a rut right now.  I was diagnosed mid-day wed. and have yet to go back into the office.  I completely skipped work after the diagnosis and Thursday and I worked form home on friday.  I'm forcing myself to go to an agility trial this whole weekend, but I keep saying ""my give a shit is broken"". We are failing miserably so far and I just don't care.  

Plus I know I will have to go back to work tomorrow.  I'm hoping most people will just ask if I'm ""feeling better"", so I can just get by with ""yes"", but I know my manager will ask me what is up.  Plus I've been dodging my mother for about 3 weeks (we usually talk every week), so I know I have to tell her soon. How do you get out of the rut of self pity, envy, jealousy, and all the other terrible emotions that surface the second I see a child or pregnant woman?

After trying for a couple of years, my wife and I couldn't get pregnant. First seminogram came with not that good numbers:

Progressive motility: 20%

Non progressive motility:10%

Not moving: 70%

Eosin? : 54%

Normal forms: 5%

Non normal forms: 95%


A year later, the numbers came more or less same, so they started poking around my wife's business.

After many procedures, they found out a bunch of issues:

-First, they found out my wife has Endometriosis.

-Second, they found a couple of cysts on one of her ovaries: Non threatening or malign at all.

-Third: One of the ovaries is ""out of place"", on a lower than normal position and close to the uterus from the outer, instead of being a bit higher placed (Or this is what we understood the doctor)


This, plus my low sperm efficiency is what is holding us back from making a baby :(


Now, we are on waitlist for getting an insemination: There's a way of procreating and we are not infertile, but in the mean time, they suggested us to keep trying: Keep a ""flow"" of sperm, performing every other day and prescribed ""Clomifene"" (citrate?) in order to give a last boost to the ""natural"" process.


First, I want to ask about what opinion do you have, specially on the clomifene treatment.

Second, I'd like to ask: Even though the doctor didn't prescribe it to me, I've read on the internet clomifene can also help with my issue, if I take it (I'm the male writing, BTW :) ) How true is this?


Finally, I'd appreciate any other advise you could spare, since we are pretty stressful and preoccupied because of all this.


Thanks!

<p>After trying for a couple of years, my wife and I couldn&#39;t get pregnant. First seminogram came with not that good numbers:</p>

<p>Progressive motility: 20%</p>

<p>Non progressive motility:10%</p>

<p>Not moving: 70%</p>

<p>Eosin? : 54%</p>

<p>Normal forms: 5%</p>

<p>Non normal forms: 95%</p>

<p>A year later, the numbers came more or less same, so they started poking around my wife&#39;s business.</p>

<p>After many procedures, they found out a bunch of issues:</p>

<p>-First, they found out my wife has Endometriosis.</p>

<p>-Second, they found a couple of cysts on one of her ovaries: Non threatening or malign at all.</p>

<p>-Third: One of the ovaries is &quot;out of place&quot;, on a lower than normal position and close to the uterus from the outer, instead of being a bit higher placed (Or this is what we understood the doctor)</p>

Should we check if my tubes are clear? Should I persue immunological testing given my known autoimmune issues & inflammatory issues of IR & PCOS? Should we be more aware of what's going on in my body before trying IUI?

But he was really casual & basically said he thinks it's weight related because nothing else had been discovered - but  i feel like I've only had minimal testing & that he is not being proactive with looking at things like he might to someone with a normal BMI.

Should I be demanding more tests first? Which ones? Or should I try some IUIs when I can and see what happens?

I'm 90% certain this was either a weird fluke or it's the beginnings of early menopause. But if anyone science-y has nothing to think about right now, would you join me in some speculation?

The only thing I've really been doing differently lately is, after hearing the vague rumors that increased protein intake might be correlated with egg quality, I started drinking protein shakes (whey isolate powder) maybe 4-5 times a week. I don't love meat and I'm too lazy to really change my diet, so this seemed like an easy fix to not eating a lot of protein naturally.

But when I looked it up, whey isolate contains insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1), which your body produces to regulate and initiate ovulation. Adding whey isolate seems to increase the IGF-1 levels in your body. Could this have triggered me to ovulate super early? I've tried to read up on this on google scholar but I can't understand most of the papers, or they're about sheep and cows.

Doc told us that we were pregnant, which was weird as I had gotten my period as scheduled but it had lasted for over a month (Gyn office said it was BC getting out of my system, never went back) and after an ultrasound (at the end of my morphine dose!) we discovered it was ectopic and that it had ruptured. Lost the tube in surgery, doc couldn't stop the bleeding.  He suggested at my follow up that I have an HSG as he thought the other tube looked clubbed, but that we could keep trying.  About 6 months to a year later, I spoke with my gyn about ordering the test but she mentioned it was usually a self pay procedure (being 20/21 y.o. I wasn't entirely sure how to navigate the insurance world and so we figured we'd wait til we had the money).  Fast forward another year and I have better insurance coverage that would at least cover all the testing to diagnose.  Met with an RE and had the HSG.

31,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Greetings, fellow citizens of this subreddit. I apologize now for my *Kyrie eleison.*

Today I met Mr. CCC's urologist, a petite gentleman with a moustache, who shook my hand and then opened his laptop to deliver the news.

Mr. CCC’s testosterone had rocketed from the 150’s into the 700’s. This was all of the good news.

His SA showed that his count and his motility had barely budged. In particular, his morphology had increased 0.25%. Not 2.5%, not 25%. One-fourth of one percent. Putting him at 2.25%.

I asked Dr. U if statistics support a scenario where Mr. CCC’s numbers could climb into the viable range after a second 90-day cycle, or if it was time to start a GoFundMe for IF treatment.

Dr. U gently replied that we needed to start the GoFundMe.

We are home now after having run several errands in a black fog (and of course being surrounded by new moms at Target). I’m plowing through the first of multiple gin & tonics for tonight.

Mr. CCC has asked me if I want to leave him to find a fertile mate. I told him no, but that when the injections start he is going to be the one to have to shoot me up. He promised to do them.

Mr. CCC and I began trying for a baby in 2010, i.e. one year after we got married. Around the time we got married, our lives began to fall apart. If we didn’t have a parent in the hospital, or a car literally blowing up, or a stalker landlord, then someone was dying, or one of us would get laid off, or BOTH of us would get laid off…I could go on, and on, but you get the picture. 

At this precise moment in time, my 6-month job hunt is pretty well-known to Reddit, Mr. CCC is owed 5 figures in back wages from someone who should have never been allowed near a DBA, I financially cannot afford to pursue any of the interests that keep me sane, I’m recovering from the breaking of a twenty-year promise by two family members that invalidated a HUGE decision on which I’d already followed through…and, gentle readers, this is basically status quo since 2010. This level of hot mess is normal. This is my life. No news = good news. 

This year, we have learned that throughout our siege, the medical practitioners we trusted to think the medical thoughts for us were in fact otherwise engaged. We were barely holding basic life shit together and didn’t have the bandwidth to put more than a toe in the IF area. Not to mention that Mr. CCC's solution was ""we need to be having more sex."" Well, we are both being punished for that now. 

At a time where Mr. CCC and I are questioning how much longer we can make the rent, we are now forced to find the thousands of dollars to make our first GAMBLE at a baby. I’m 42. We are arguably already out of time, let alone money. Hell, I’m questioning being able to afford the co-pays on seeking out a therapist to get me through this!!

If there is in fact some deity involved, I can only assume the people who say we were not meant to have kids are right.  Yay, bad cliches being true.

40,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Had a GREAT meeting today with HR rep at my employer! I reached out to her a few weeks ago because our employer covers infertility diagnosis and repair of an underlying condition, but does not cover any ARTs or meds. It really falls short in actually helping people treat infertility (so many of us either don't have an ""underlying condition,"" or we have an issue like low egg supply that can't be helped except with assisted reproduction). 

So: my aim of the meeting was to a) get HR person on board and b) figure out the process for my university's health coverage and determine who the decision makers are. 

The HR person is definitely on board! With the help of this amazing and fantastic reddit community, I put together two documents  -- a list of competing college/ universities' infertility coverage and a proposal specific to my university listing all the reasons why coverage is essential. The HR person really liked both, because it does the work for her! The colleges/universities list is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FR3lCUDwDC6iDeaNRVXifOaRNwE2aNEKuc_zuZaNh4Q/edit?usp=sharing

The proposal stated: infertility is a disease and should be covered like other diseases; there is a big need within our university community for infertility treatment; comprehensive medical care for infertility is cost-effective, and can help decrease other costs; offering this coverage helps promote the university's wellness mission; offering this coverage makes us competitive and helps attract/ retain faculty and staff.

Next step is making sure the other people on the HR team are on board with this ask going on the wish list. I'll ensure this by having some stakeholders (alum, hopefully faculty and student groups) express support directly to the HR team.

After that, if it's still on the wish list, the insurance company prices it out and all of the wish list items go to the board and the executives to vote on. So - I'll hopefully be able to get that complete list of decision makers, and have the stakeholders also reach out and express support.

If it make it through all this, coverage would be extended in 2017. As I said to the HR person -- my partner and I have already paid for our fertility treatments and have no horse in this race. Adding coverage isn't going to help us. But dammit -- this is a disease and it's ridiculous that a prestigious, progressive institution doesn't cover this disease treatment.

Yesterday was CD2 and [it happened again](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/44ro7a/new_femara_side_effect_urinary_retention_yay_fun/). Last night I had nausea-inducing, can't see straight cramps. I had a heat pad on and had taken midol and neither of those were doing any good. I went to sleep and tried to ignore them. Then I woke up in around 3am and went to go to the bathroom and couldn't. Again. 

At least this time, I knew what was happening. I waited around for the insane cramps to pass and about 30 minutes later, I could pee again. I felt somewhat better afterward, but I still had pretty horrific cramps for the rest of the night and kept waking up from them. 

This morning, I had nausea and awful cramps during my BM.

The only thing I can think now is that it's endo, and it just was never that bad before because my periods were lighter when I was anovulatory/on BC. I've already emailed my nurse to ask what steps we need to take to investigate endo.

Is it because most women are scared to talk about this stuff or am I truly the only one? Or are doctors just not listening to us when we finally fucking speak up?

I didn't take birth control or any other drug before starting the cycle - just started stims on my natural day 3. The result was 17 eggs, 13 mature, 13 embryos, 4 made it blast, all abnormal.

Does anyone know what protocol this was? Flare? Long? I have no idea.

For those who have gone through a few IVF cycles, would you expect the RE to change the protocol based on the last experience? She said at one point after it failed that she might not ""stimulate as much"" next time because sometimes that affects the egg quality.

49,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"TL;DR: My left tube is a bit distended and has some fluid in it (technically a hydrosalpinx, but doc said today that he's ""seen much, much worse"") and my right is probably now blocked.  Should I remove my tubes before proceeding with IVF?  Do an egg retrieval, then have surgery, then hopefully defrost an embryo and go for it a couple of months later?  Toss the dice and if a perfectly great PGS-tested embryo fails to implant realize it was probably my toxic tubes?  

Some of you may know/remember me.  I've been coming here on and off for the better part of two years.  The story so far for those who need to be caught up: 

Husband and I started trying to get pregnant in 2013.  We were lazy about protecting from May onward, and really started trying in October 2013.  In February 2014, my irregular cycles told me something was wrong.  We went to the doc, who said, hey, I'll fix you with Clomid/Femara and IUI.  Clomid didn't really work, but Femara did.  I got pregnant in May 2014 with a lovely baby boy during our second month at the doctor.  I had some guilt about not being infertile enough to really be part of the club.  

Then, at 22 weeks of pregnancy, on October 5, 2014, my incompetent cervix (as we now know it to be - call it ""cervical insufficiency"" all you want, but that fucking thing is just plain incompetent) gave out and Ethan William was born way too early.  He weighed one pound.  We got to hold him and love him and take home his footprints, and the grief was - and still is - unimaginable.  

We started trying again under the auspices of the fertility doc in January of 2015.  We monitored two cycles without meds to see if a pregnancy had regulated my cycles - no dice.  So we went back to Femara, my miracle drug, hoping it would work within a month or two.  It did.  

Except that my pregnancy in March 2015 was ectopic.  

So was my pregnancy in August of 2015.  

Doc didn't have a good explanation - her best guess is that my tubes have always been shitty and Ethan was a fluke.  So I took a bunch of methotrexate, grieved some more, and made sure to keep seeing our counselor, and I went through two more HSGs with the idea that come January 2016 we'd bring on my husband's insurance so IVF could be covered.  

While we waited, I got pregnant - spontaneously - in December of 2015.  And you guessed it - a third ectopic.  More methotrexate, more waiting, more frustration.  Finally, at the beginning of February of this year, my hormone levels reached zero, I went on birth control, and we said OK - time for some testing so we can get on with IVF. 

I had my nurse consult last week and we developed a color-coded Google calendar to keep track of meds, preliminary appointments, and results from the doc.  It's still hanging on the fridge.  The real test was today - a 4th HSG to make sure my tubes were still patent.  

But you've already been spoiled - they're probably not.  My left tube filled with dye and looked a bit sausage-y, but eventually we saw some spillage.  My right...not so much.  Again, the doc said he's seen way worse, and the results of my HSG are kind of inconclusive in that we don't know if they'll affect the outcome of IVF and absolutely need to be removed. 

So - ladies with tubal issues - talk to me.  I haven't spoken to my actual doctor yet, only the other doctor from my practice who performed my HSG today.  But I have a pretty good sense of my options.  Option 1 - Proceed with IVF anyway and hope that we don't throw away a perfectly great embryo and thousands of dollars.  Option 2 - Remove my tubes ASAP and work on recovering so we can hopefully get back on track with IVF in yet another 2-3 months.  (Cause, you know, what's another few months of waiting?  Oh yeah, did you know that 4 or 5 setbacks of 2-3 months each will eventually set you back a year and a half?  Welcome to my life.)  Option 3 - Go forward with an egg retrieval, put the embryos on ice, and enjoy my IVF hiatus by having surgery, then doing a FET after my recovery.

<p>Some of you may know/remember me.  I&#39;ve been coming here on and off for the better part of two years.  The story so far for those who need to be caught up: </p>

<p>Husband and I started trying to get pregnant in 2013.  We were lazy about protecting from May onward, and really started trying in October 2013.  In February 2014, my irregular cycles told me something was wrong.  We went to the doc, who said, hey, I&#39;ll fix you with Clomid/Femara and IUI.  Clomid didn&#39;t really work, but Femara did.  I got pregnant in May 2014 with a lovely baby boy during our second month at the doctor.  I had some guilt about not being infertile enough to really be part of the club.  </p>

<p>Then, at 22 weeks of pregnancy, on October 5, 2014, my incompetent cervix (as we now know it to be - call it &quot;cervical insufficiency&quot; all you want, but that fucking thing is just plain incompetent) gave out and Ethan William was born way too early.  He weighed one pound.  We got to hold him and love him and take home his footprints, and the grief was - and still is - unimaginable.  </p>

<p>We started trying again under the auspices of the fertility doc in January of 2015.  We monitored two cycles without meds to see if a pregnancy had regulated my cycles - no dice.  So we went back to Femara, my miracle drug, hoping it would work within a month or two.  It did.  </p>

<p>Except that my pregnancy in March 2015 was ectopic.  </p>

<p>So was my pregnancy in August of 2015.  </p>

<p>Doc didn&#39;t have a good explanation - her best guess is that my tubes have always been shitty and Ethan was a fluke.  So I took a bunch of methotrexate, grieved some more, and made sure to keep seeing our counselor, and I went through two more HSGs with the idea that come January 2016 we&#39;d bring on my husband&#39;s insurance so IVF could be covered.  </p>

<p>While we waited, I got pregnant - spontaneously - in December of 2015.  And you guessed it - a third ectopic.  More methotrexate, more waiting, more frustration.  Finally, at the beginning of February of this year, my hormone levels reached zero, I went on birth control, and we said OK - time for some testing so we can get on with IVF. </p>

<p>I had my nurse consult last week and we developed a color-coded Google calendar to keep track of meds, preliminary appointments, and results from the doc.  It&#39;s still hanging on the fridge.  The real test was today - a 4th HSG to make sure my tubes were still patent.  </p>

<p>But you&#39;ve already been spoiled - they&#39;re probably not.  My left tube filled with dye and looked a bit sausage-y, but eventually we saw some spillage.  My right...not so much.  Again, the doc said he&#39;s seen way worse, and the results of my HSG are kind of inconclusive in that we don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll affect the outcome of IVF and absolutely need to be removed. </p>

I haven't been trying for a full year yet, just around 9 months - but I think my diagnosis classifies me as ""infertile"".  If I am breaking the sub rules, please feel free to delete my post.

2 weeks ago I had a vaginal ultrasound that, I think, confirmed a diagnosis of PCOS, although I don't believe it's officially been documented on my chart. That was a tough blow, but coincidently this same US showed ""spontaneous ovulation"" 3 days prior (CD30) and the accompanying blood tests showed my estrogen level was acceptable.    All this made the PCOS diagnosis a much easier pill to swallow because 1) I can ovulate and 2) I could use Clomid and Ferma (previously they said I probably couldn't because of estrogen levels).   This unexpected outcome also meant that we had to cancel my HSG until I either had a positive pregnancy test OR menstruated.  Obviously the latter happened (11 day luteal phase for complete disclosure).

Today I finally had my HSG.  My husband couldn't come to this appointment because it was in the middle of the day and he just started a new job. I honestly thought it was just a technicality because I already had the PCOS diagnosis and I've had no other ""risk factors"" that would contribute to something that would show up on an HSG.  To my udder and complete surprise this happened:

""The right tube spilled but appeared to mildly dilated and exhibited several distal out pouching which is suggestive of tubal diease. A large left tubal hydrosalpinx was seen. It was not clear if the left tube tube spilled.""

Basically, one tube is blown and the other is damaged, but not blown.  Prognosis is IVF is only option.  Prior to this, we had discussed our options and decided that we would use Clomid/Ferma and injectables, and would consider IUI if it came to that - but would not consider IVF.  Thus, when my Dr. told me this in the exam room - I burst into tears because what I heard was, ""you will never have children.""

Husband has since some home and is great.  He's super supportive, but he's still not wanting to do IVF.  I'm not sure if I want to do it yet or not either, but I'm avidly researching clinics, success rates and cost (which is illusive and frustrating, especially because insurance will cover nothing beyond the diagnosis).  He's ready to accept never having children and get another dog.  It was one thing to pass on IVF when I thought it was the last step on a long journey, where I felt like we had given it the good fight.  Now it feels like, without other options, we can't really say we've tried.  I have nothing against IVF as a treatment in general.  I'm just concerned that it's expensive and invasive, and I'm not sure I can handle the emotional loss if it fails.

I guess I'm just looking for someone who is in a similar situation for advice on how to deal with the initial shock and diagnosis. I can't help but wonder why me? Also, I'm going over all my history to find the ""infection"" that must have caused this damage.  The only thing I can think of is I had laparoscopic gallbladder removal surgery. I don't recall an infection - but maybe I missed the symptoms? I feel like I'm being punished for all the times I said I never wanted children as an adolescent.  I also keep randomly breaking into sobs, I don't know how I'm going to will myself to go back to work tomorrow.

Finally for a complete 180.  If we aren't going to do IVF, I have a ton of healthy eggs, that are apparently never going to do me any good.  Can I donate any? I'm 29 (until October) and I'm worried that I'm approaching the age limit for this. Also, does having high testosterone or high AMH/follicle count eliminate me from doing this?

Thanks for reading this and I'm sorry you are in this club with me, but happy there is a place to talk about it.

Background (Pre-RE):
-Normal menstrual cycles from 12-19
-19-28 I was on Nuvaring
-June 2015 removed nuvaring and started officially trying. Had typical withdrawal bleed.
-No period for 90 days, got progesterone, but failed to bleed
-Moved to estrogen and progesterone, successful withdrawal bleed (138 day cycle)
-Next cycle, similar issues, but acted faster, so only a 71 day cycle
-Next cycle, no ovulation present at CD21, so they agree to send me to RE

Diagnostic Tests:
-Bloodwork all came back normal EXCEPT testosterone was high
-Vaginal US showed >40 cysts on both ovaries

I started Clomid in November and had my first (failed) IUI that same month.  December, January were busts because of his illness followed by me throwing my back out (hard).  February I either didn't ovulate, or ovulated before CD11 and wasn't testing.

<p>All this to say that I&#39;m really hesitant about being hopeful.  It seems like everything&#39;s ready for our best shot yet.  We know I have good follicles, we know my uterine lining is good, and my husband has been taking his supplements and doing what he needs to do to improve motility.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ll have been married for 19 years this November.  We&#39;ve been through all our rocky, tumultuous BS and have settled into a very comfortable, loving marriage.  We&#39;ve got a house, and I&#39;ve got a work-at-home job.  We live next door to family that can help us and is excited about this journey.  It&#39;s TIME, dangit.  But time is running out.  I&#39;ll be 38 in May.</p>

<p>It just seems like too much good stuff, so it&#39;s bound to fail.  And if it does, I know I&#39;m going to be devastated.  </p>

<p>Thanks for listening.  Anyone else get really anxious when they get hopeful, or am I just neurotic?</p>

I posted a thread a week ago about our HCG levels, but due to it falling off the front page i didn't get any responses to the update so have decided to post again. I hope that's ok

So, We had a frozen blastocyst embryo transferred. 7 days later we got a clear positive on a pee stick pregnancy test.

9 days post transfer we had our bloods done and were told our HCG was 49, which is low but pregnant. The nurse said this can be fine we just needed to go back in 2 days later to check it's doubling.

So we returned 11 days post transfer and the HCG had risen to only 54. We were told the strong probability was that a miscarriage would happen but that we had to go back in three days to be sure.

So Monday just gone was 14 days post transfer, we were expecting  to be told the HCG had dropped etc etc, to our (and the nurses) surprise the HCG had trebled to 155. She said that the probability is still that it hasn't worked but that there is hope that it has and that it was just a rare slow starter. We have to go back on this friday.

My wife did a pregnancy digital test last night that suggested she was 2-3 weeks pregnant which suggests her HCG is still on an upward curve.

What do you think our chances are? the hospital are very non committal, were were told on monday to ""hope for the best but expect the worst""

67,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi ladies,

I am one of the lucky ones who has infertility treatments covered by insurance. I get up to $15'000 for infertility medications and treatments (lifetime), BUT: I also have a pretty high co-pay of 30% for both meds and treatments. 

The pharmacy just called and said that after insurance coverage, my medications would still be 3k out of pocket. If I bought them out of pocket without my insurance, I would have to pay 4k (they have a discount program for the clinic I am going through), so basically I'd be saving 1k. They also said that the prices they charge the insurance companies differ from what they charge individuals who pay out of pocked, and based on my co-pay quote it seems that they would charge my insurance 9k (insurance would pay 6K, leaving me with a third of 3k). So basically, if I have to go through two cycles, 12K of my coverage would already be used up just for the medication based on these inflated insurance prices. 

If medication prices are inflated for insurance, would it make sense for me to just pay for the medications and use my money toward the actual procedure and doctor bills in case I need multiple cycles? Or are those also inflated?  Or should I bill everything and hope I only need one cycle? Does anyone have experience with this dilemma?

<p>I am one of the lucky ones who has infertility treatments covered by insurance. I get up to $15&#39;000 for infertility medications and treatments (lifetime), BUT: I also have a pretty high co-pay of 30% for both meds and treatments. </p>

<p>The pharmacy just called and said that after insurance coverage, my medications would still be 3k out of pocket. If I bought them out of pocket without my insurance, I would have to pay 4k (they have a discount program for the clinic I am going through), so basically I&#39;d be saving 1k. They also said that the prices they charge the insurance companies differ from what they charge individuals who pay out of pocked, and based on my co-pay quote it seems that they would charge my insurance 9k (insurance would pay 6K, leaving me with a third of 3k). So basically, if I have to go through two cycles, 12K of my coverage would already be used up just for the medication based on these inflated insurance prices. </p>

<p>If medication prices are inflated for insurance, would it make sense for me to just pay for the medications and use my money toward the actual procedure and doctor bills in case I need multiple cycles? Or are those also inflated?  Or should I bill everything and hope I only need one cycle? Does anyone have experience with this dilemma?</p>

I don&#39;t even know who to talk to about this -- I have an OB appointment tomorrow but I&#39;m not even sure if I should be talking to her or my RE.  This is so frustrating; all I want is to be normal again.   I just need to share how I&#39;m feeling with more people who understand and have been through stuff similar to this.  Even if you don&#39;t respond, thanks for reading.</p>

**Background** So... Me (33F), and my SO (30M). Live in a farm in the back and beyond. I have 1 son, out of 12 pregnancies, 1 stillborn full term (placenta stopped feeding @ 5-6 months, wasn't picked up because I was a runaway), twins - cutting a long story short, i was 22 weeks gone, and well- their dad decided to kick them out of me, he succeeded. I then had my son (14 now) and have had miscarriages since then. 

I have a truck load of health issues that I'm currently wading through with specialists, some of these are because of what I suffered in the past, others it would appear to be misdiagnoses and thus mis-medicated. 

After the birth of my son (full term nearly, placenta stopped feeding @ approx 8 months, he was induced 10 days early) I started to have really very heavy clotted bleeding, went to the dr's who started off by doing a smear test. It came back inconclusive. So he did another one- again, inconclusive. He did a third.. You're seeing the pattern here right? Each time he did it, he left me in pain, and bleeding quite badly (he stated this was normal) After the 3rd one came back as inconclusive, I decided to book in for a smear with one of the other dr's at the practise, lo and behold, this one came back okay, but due to the heavy bleeding etc, she sent me to a gynae to see about PCOS because in her mind, I had it. I went along and saw him, had an internal scan, and no cysts, he told me 100% I did *not* have PCOS. Dr decided to medicate me for it anyway, with the excuse that it would regulate any periods I did have. 

I then didn't have a period for 6 years. All throughout this time I was repeatedly going to the GP to ask her why this was happening. She just blatantly said PCOS. 

So. I left it at that, I was married to a man who was infertile due to a vasectomy, it hurt but at this point I'm thinking what the hell, I can't have kids anyway. From that day- this I have been on Metformin (1500mg a day). 

I still struggle with irregular periods and miscarriages etc. Today I went to see a new gynae (because of unrelated issues) and he is now looking to work alongside an endocrinologist to get my hormone levels right, he said that my testosterone was too high and other things. He is going to fix it- he said. But I have been misdiagnosed for so long by so many people, if I let myself for one second think that I have a chance, a chance at the daughter I never had. I open myself up to more heartbreak. My heart is already in pieces, my friends are having children left right and centre and I'm not ashamed to say I'm jealous. I can't hold their kids. I can't see them. It hurts and it's a pain like no other, you can't describe it to people who aren't going through what you're going through. It's part pure envy and part soul shattering agony. 

I just don't know where to go from here. I don't want to get my hopes up. I can't. But at least I'm being ""fixed"" right? That's something I suppose. 

It's taken them long enough to get this far.. If it takes them this long to rectify their own f**k ups then I'm done for, because it'll be too late for me. 

I have a scan booked as urgent with the hospital so that the gynae can prove I don't have PCOS... And then maybe we can look towards other treatments. I see the endo in May- jesus, why the hell does this stuff take so long???  1 year to see a gynae, 6 months to see an endo-  and if it wasn't for a hospital dr threatening my own GP with the health board unless he referred me as it was quite apparent I'm not being treated properly, I would still be none the wiser and in less heartache.

After a couple years of infertility treatments, in which she even lost an ovary, they stopped after IUIs and she and her husband decided to adopt.  She's been a big support through my journey and a shoulder to cry on.

Today, I got a text from my mom saying she's pregnant.  I called my mom, furious that my cousin didn't even have the guts to tell me herself and my mom decided it was for the best to text me and tell me.  No, it really fucking wasn't.

A bit of background on my family: I have two male cousins with wives about to pop this month (one is even 3 days overdue).  My parents moved to the town my previously infertile cousin and her sister live, and they both have babies, one through adoption and one through very minor infertility treatment. My parents spent Christmas with the pregnant girls two months ago.  I have another cousin who I know is going through IF treatments (learned that through the grapevine), but I have a sneaking suspicion based on her husband's weirdly lovey-dovey Facebook post recently that they might be pregnant also.

So I told my mother flat-out I was not going to spend Christmas where they are, especially with a newborn now.  It would have already been unbearable with the existing babies, but I can't deal with a newborn.  My mom said that it's March and she doesn't want to commit, especially because she needs to think about my brother who lives across the country.  WTF.  My parents moved to their new town and house about a month ago, from like 750 miles away.  My brother has no attachment to it, whatsoever.  It should have been a no-brainer that they come to us.  So I told her the fact that she even hesitated and refused to make that decision shows where her priorities lie, with my cousins and their happy little families. I told her then, that she isn't welcome, because there is no reason why she could reasonably choose my cousins and extended family over us FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW.  I've told my husband to just invite his parents here today, so that my mom can't even change her mind.  She's a selfish bitch, and it really should have been a no-brainer for her, but she really places so much stock in her relationship with her extended family.  Fuck her.

I'm so angry.  I'm so angry that literally every family member of mine who is married has a baby.  I'm angry that my mom and cousin handled the announcement the way they did.  I'm angry at my mom and my cousin, and at the other fertile people in my family who have been shitty through this whole process (in case anyone forgot, one of the pregnant cousins sent a pregnancy announcement as a Christmas card AND told other family members without our consent).

And now I have ""But cousin though she was infertile, adopted, and had a baby when she wasn't even thinking about it it!  You never know what can happen!"" to look forward to for the rest of my life.

FUCKING GREAT.  Happy Saturday, everyone!  I'll be at the dog-friendly bar.

She&#39;s a selfish bitch, and it really should have been a no-brainer for her, but she really places so much stock in her relationship with her extended family.  Fuck her.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so angry.  I&#39;m so angry that literally every family member of mine who is married has a baby.  I&#39;m angry that my mom and cousin handled the announcement the way they did.  I&#39;m angry at my mom and my cousin, and at the other fertile people in my family who have been shitty through this whole process (in case anyone forgot, one of the pregnant cousins sent a pregnancy announcement as a Christmas card AND told other family members without our consent).</p>

<p>And now I have &quot;But cousin though she was infertile, adopted, and had a baby when she wasn&#39;t even thinking about it it!  You never know what can happen!&quot; to look forward to for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>FUCKING GREAT.  Happy Saturday, everyone!  I&#39;ll be at the dog-friendly bar.</p>

All that has taken since last October, yet it seems like we've done so little compared to how much some of you have been through! 

So, what's typically next? Do people even do 200mg of Clomid? Switch to Femara? Injectables? Any of those plus IUI? 

Also, every time I get an ultrasound they comment on how retroflexed my uterus is. I'm starting to worry that the extreme angle of things is perhaps making it difficult for the sperm to get to the egg, and thus an IUI would help get 'em up there?

For several years my wife would have these spells where she would feel nauseated and then throw up for hours at a time. During these spells we found out her blood pressure was spiking to stroke levels (200/130 or a bit higher sometimes). This went on for quite some time and they couldn't figure it out. We saw so many doctors of all kinds of specialties and she had every work up imaginable looking at her blood pressure. Outside of the spells her blood pressure was normal and if they put her on medicine it made her blood pressure too low. Eventually they found gall stones and gall bladder problems. She had her gall bladder out in September of 2014. Since then the issues have largely gone away, though she'll get nauseated and throw up after eating certain things, especially fatty/greasy things as is common from what I understand after having your gall bladder removed. Her blood pressure remains normal.

We went in for her egg retrieval on Tuesday in order to proceed with IVF as we've also been having fertility problems for years and had several unsuccessful IUIs. During her egg retrieval her blood pressure spiked. The doctors freaked out and said they won't move forward with anything unless we could get some kind of clearance from a doctor about her blood pressure. She made an appointment with our GP the following day, went in, got her blood pressure checked and it was normal. The GP said she didn't know what we wanted. Her blood pressure is normal. 

The fertility doctor is calling, telling us the eggs are fertilizing perfectly and everything there is going great, but she will not move forward with our scheduled implantation on Sunday. 

We have no idea what to do. The fertility doctor says we need to send all the tests that she ever had done in the years we were trying to figure out the problem. We went to so many doctors and hospitals we don't even remember where all the tests were done or who to contact to get them. Not only that, but she gave us 4 hours to get them.

It looks like we're just done and I'm so angry that they're telling us the fertilization is going great, but they're just going to throw that all away.

I was posting on another forum but I can't stand reading another cutesy acronym, so I came over here. My friends in real life have offered useful suggestions like ""try clearblue ovulation monitors instead of first response! I had trouble and finally got pregnant my 5th month when I used those!"" or ""just relax, get drunk, and it'll happen,"" or ""if it's meant to be it will be.""

We've been trying for 21 months now - we started trying immediately after we got married as my parents are infertility survivors(I'm an IVF baby) and even though things looked text book perfect I was worried since I grew up hearing about infertility. Everyone laughed at me then and told me I was silly...and now they all have babies and I'm here. 

My parents have been wonderfully supportive after they processed the shock and the trauma of coming back to the infertility world after their 8 years there. We do not have remotely similar infertility issues - my father had mild semen volume issues, my mother had huge hormonal issues and a lack of predictable response to medications. 

Our issues are 3% morph on his side, motility borderline but passable, especially once it's washed for the IUI, the rest is WNL, my HSG showed clear tubes but my uterus was pulled to one side. Regular ovulatory cycles. AMH was fine, but I don't remember the exact value. 

We're currently heading into our 3rd IUI before I get a lap to check for endo/pelvic adhesions. My RE will be doing the surgery, not a random ob gyn. I'm terrified of being intubated. 

The wrinkle in all of this - regardless of discussion and agreements made prior to marriage, my husband says he refuses IVF as it conflicts with his religion.

denial
anger
bargaining 
depression
acceptance

I feel like I went through the ""Denial"" one in the time from my husband's first bad SA to the second one two months later that confirmed the first and confirmed we needed IVF.

Denial - ""the lab screwed it up. How could this be if his GF got pregnant 18 years ago when he was 20 (true story). The count can't be that low -it must be because he's just getting over the flu. This vitamin cocktail will help. Let's get a second opinion."" 

Then once we knew we had to do IVF, it was time for ""Bargaining"":
""I just need one baby and it will be fine. I will be healthy and a perfect patient and will eat perfectly and take my vitamins and never go out again and go to bed early every night and be a good human being - just give me the baby! I'll do anything!""

Then as the IVF cycle was happening at it all became real - ""Depression.""
""Why do I have to do this when everyone around me is falling pregnant no problem. This isn't fair, it's never going to work, etc."" (And finding out nothing made it to freeze made it even worse.)

Now, I'm in the TWW of my first IVF and I'm definitely in the ""Anger"" stage. In fact, I'm fucking furious.
""Why do I have to put up with this shit? Why the FUCK didn't my husband or his mother tell me he had surgery for an undescended testicle as a child?

Why does it not seem to bother him when all I can do is think about it 24/7? Why do I have to get shots in the ass every day of a medication that mimics the symptoms of pregnancy? Why does this all have to cost so much?""

Have any of you really made it to the ""Acceptance"" stage?
Because even if we have IVF success, I feel right now that I'll always be somehow resentful of missing the ""magic"" and fun of making a baby the natural way.

https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/48d2o0/my_re_put_the_vaginal_ultrasound_wand_up_my_butt/

I consider this an interim update because the doctor is supposed to contact us directly but here is what has happened in the past few days.

My husband was equally upset about this and sent an email to our coordinator (I do not have direct email for the Dr).  He asked if this was intentional, why was it not explained and mentioned that I was upset, in pain, and confused.

The coordinator emailed back and apologized for my discomfort and said ""we only perform vaginal ultrasound in our office.""

So it was clearly a mistake.  The coordinator said she would have the doctor contact us directly.  That has not happened yet, but I will update with the outcome.  

As if this was all not hard enough.  I am still too embarrassed to discuss it and am having her call my husband.  At this point I am not sure what I want to come of it.  An apology?  But really I am so upset that I am going to have to find another doctor who can be trusted to put their patients well being FIRST.  I am more upset by this as the days go by and almost worry that I won't have the courage to continue with infertility treatment.  And then what?  Say goodbye to my dreams because I am so humiliated?

<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/48d2o0/my_re_put_the_vaginal_ultrasound_wand_up_my_butt/"">https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/48d2o0/my_re_put_the_vaginal_ultrasound_wand_up_my_butt/</a></p>

<p>I consider this an interim update because the doctor is supposed to contact us directly but here is what has happened in the past few days.</p>

<p>My husband was equally upset about this and sent an email to our coordinator (I do not have direct email for the Dr).  He asked if this was intentional, why was it not explained and mentioned that I was upset, in pain, and confused.</p>

<p>The coordinator emailed back and apologized for my discomfort and said &quot;we only perform vaginal ultrasound in our office.&quot;</p>

<p>So it was clearly a mistake.  The coordinator said she would have the doctor contact us directly.  That has not happened yet, but I will update with the outcome.  </p>

<p>As if this was all not hard enough.  I am still too embarrassed to discuss it and am having her call my husband.  At this point I am not sure what I want to come of it.  An apology?  But really I am so upset that I am going to have to find another doctor who can be trusted to put their patients well being FIRST.  I am more upset by this as the days go by and almost worry that I won&#39;t have the courage to continue with infertility treatment.  And then what?  Say goodbye to my dreams because I am so humiliated?  I don&#39;t know.  </p>

After 12 months of trying to conceive and nothing, my husband makes an appointment to get his sperm tested, and I get a HSG. The day before his test, my husband gets into a crazy accident and ends up breaking multiple bones, almost dying, and needing open heart surgery. We had our first vacation planned that summer (we never even took a honeymoon so this was going to be our first real trip together) and had to cancel because he was still recovering. We lost a few thousand dollars needing to cancel the trip.

Needless to say we also took a few months off trying for a baby, but now we're back in the saddle. It's now been 18 months since we first started trying and after dealing with months of his medical issues, we're ready to start tackling the medical side of infertility. Now that my husband is mostly recovered, we plan another very much-needed vacation. Our plan was to take it easy, relax, and then go full-force into fertility mode.  Vacation is supposed to be in 2 weeks.

Now there's a CDC notice that our destination has reported zika cases, and they're saying that anyone trying to get pregnant shouldn't travel there. They don't know anything about how long it can remain in sperm, what the risks are, there aren't any widely available tests, and I'm seeing things like ""if you are pregnant and your partner traveled somewhere with zika, don't have sex for the entire pregnancy"" - which obviously if we're trying to conceive isn't going to happen.

Part of me wants to say fuck it and go anyway, the chances are so small, and we REALLY need a relaxing break for once after this horrific year.

But of course if we do go, we're going to worry the whole time. Our relaxing vacation is already ruined at this point. 

I'm so gutted. I know it's a luxury to be able to go on a trip like this, but we really, really, really needed it, and now we're out a ton of money AGAIN and have a second ruined vacation, and I just feel so fucked from this past year.

My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant since January 2013.  I’ll be 35 years old in a few months.  

After four first trimester miscarriages, my RE has suggested that we move on to IVF with PGS.  I’m starting Lupron injections tomorrow, with my egg retrieval scheduled to be around the end of March and an FET to follow.  

This sub was so helpful as we came to the decision to move on to IVF – I learned a lot reading all of your posts, and that led to me asking a lot of questions of my RE and feeling confident in the decision making process.  I felt like I wanted to give us the best chance possible at having the most healthy embryo implant.  I know there are no guarantees, but I find myself wanting as much control over this process as I can.  I’m trying as best I can to keep my expectations realistic, and to keep my fears about what could happen through this cycle, or what information we could uncover, at bay.  For the most part I am excited about trying something new, and hoping that it will be successful.  

My husband and I weren’t always on the same page with moving to IVF, and this helped me feel like I wasn’t alone.  Thank you.

Here’s a little bit more about my history…

Since tracking my cycles beginning in January 2013, I’d noticed that I’d start spotting around 9-10 days after ovulation.  I had a chemical pregnancy in July 2013, and in November 2013, I pushed for a referral to an RE for what I believed was a short luteal phase.  My bloodwork, HSG, and endometrial biopsy all came back normal.  In January 2014, I asked about progesterone supplementation and we agreed that I would start Crinone three days after ovulation and continue through to 10 weeks were I to get pregnant.  

I got pregnant in February 2014, and had my first miscarriage at 8 weeks in May 2014.  I miscarried at home after spotting for two days.  We had seen the heartbeat twice during our early ultrasounds with our RE, and then I started spotting.  I went in for a third ultrasound and everything looked fine, but the spotting continued and the cramping got worse.  I miscarried at home that evening.  That has by far been the hardest loss for me, physically and emotionally.

I got pregnant for the third time in February 2015.  I was much more cautious during this pregnancy.  I switched from Crinone to progesterone in oil injections to try something different.  Again we saw the heartbeat during our two early ultrasounds.  No spotting this time around, which was reassuring.  I went to my first OB appointment at 10 weeks and it was at that appointment that they could not find a heartbeat.  I opted for a D&C so that we could have testing done, and it determined that there was a chromosomal abnormality (Turner’s Syndrome).  I was so relieved to have a REASON.  My OB and RE assured me that this was just bad luck, and there was no reason to think that I wouldn’t have a healthy pregnancy in the future (and we had some additional testing done – karyotyping and an RPL panel – which came back normal).

I got pregnant for the fourth time in September 2015, and continued with PIO injections for this pregnancy.  Starting at around five weeks I had brown spotting which made me panic, but had two early ultrasounds and again, heartbeat and growth were on track.  I went in for my first OB appointment at 10 weeks and again, they could not find a heartbeat.  I had another D&C done in November 2015 and testing determined that there was a chromosomal abnormality (triploidy), and I was diagnosed with a partial molar pregnancy.  I was told I’d need to wait until March 2016 to try again, which brings us here.

So – thanks for reading this novel of an intro – and if you have any tips for Lupron injections, I’m all ears!

My wife and I did IVF and had a 5 day frozen blastocyst transferred 9 days ago.

Today we did a blood test and the HCG measured 49. The nurse told us that this means my wife is pregnant. However, she said we have to go back in a couple of days to do another test as she said it is a little low.

We have done the wee on a stick test a few times and whilst it does indicate pregnant the indication isn't getting stronger or weaker, just stays kinda the same.

Should we be worried? We were overjoyed that it was positive but are super worried she is miscarrying.

Does anyone have experience of this? Is this HCG ok for a 9 day frozen transfer?

I'm pretty convinced that I just didn't ovulate.  My cycle was ""unmedicated"" but I used tamoxifen like femara to help with ovulation and lining.  He never suggested a trigger shot.

They felt full and pinchy like after the egg retrieval when I had mild OHSS.  I wasn't sure if maybe the tamoxifen or the endometrin could have caused it.  Or maybe a cyst?

Need some Intel. I have stage IV Endo and it has pinned my ovaries behind my uterus and generally beaten the everloving shit out of them. As such, am a low responder to stims. 

Had a monitoring appt today and there is some serious concern about getting to my right ovary for retrieval.
I mean, there are only two viable follicles on either ovary, so those right two are kind of crucial. 

We talked about cancelling this cycle to try another protocol (potential 20% increase in follicles) but they think that in the three months between cycles my body would get so much worse it would negate any benefits of the different protocol. My ovary had become pinned behind my ute again in the three months since surgery, while on BCP- so the Endo will go hog wild without it. 

She said they will try to get to the right, but that I will likely be in great amounts of pain, so we need to decide now if it's worth the ""maybe"". I said yes, and to strap me down and ignore me if I ask them to stop.

She's really going to need to dig for it, but has committed to doing as much as she can, regardless of how well I tolerate it. So I ask you- how bad is it really? I need a frame of reference before I walk into this mess on Saturday.  Any and all Intel is so appreciated.

194,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello! I have been doing lots of research on IVF meds and pricing. I’m in the US and am completely out of pocket.

I wanted to share what I’ve learned – both the general tips below and my price breakdown sheet (includes prices in the US from February 2016).

- Most regular pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, RiteAid, etc) will not carry specialty infertility drugs.

- There are many infertility drug specialty pharmacies. Often they have their prices listed online. Usually they do overnight shipping. 

- Work with your doctor to find out when and how you’ll order meds for your cycle. Some REs prefer to place the order, and some will have the patient place an order. 

- There are a number of much cheaper specialty pharmacies located outside of the US. (US med prices are so high because the US has a free market and drug companies set drug prices.) Many infertility med speciality pharmacies in the UK, Europe, and Israel have websites and will send meds to US patients with a valid prescription. Note that shipping from overseas usually means a long wait time (in some cases 2-3 weeks) and people have reported issues with meds being stopped in customs. My clinic had concerns about drug quality, though I know other clinics have advised their patients to order from non-US pharmacies. US clinics can not place orders to non-US pharmacies, but individual patients may do so as long as the meds are for personal use and are non-psychotropic. Ultimately I decided not to go with an overseas pharmacy.

- If you know in advance you’ll be using certain meds, check with your insurance company on coverage.

- Get your RE to give you the physical prescriptions to price shop at brick and mortar places (most pharmacies will NOT run a price check with your insurance card unless they have an actual prescription; in the US, to do so is insurance fraud).

- For some meds, like Clomid and Femara, check with your Costco/Sam’s Club. At Costco, you do not have to be member to use the pharmacy. I got Femara for $2.00 at Costco versus the over $100 that CVS quoted me.

- There are discount programs, rebates, and coupons available to help with meds. Often the discount programs are income based and require income verification with your last year’s tax documents. Discount programs include Compassionate Care; Compassionate Corps (for veterans and spouses of veterans); First Steps; New Life Agency Fertility Pharmacy Care Card; and Heart + Savings through Ferring Fertility. Rebates and coupons are generally available to everyone, but there may be time constraints for when you can submit, and you may not be able to combine with discount programs. Rebate programs include IVF Greenlight/ Ferring medical discount program and Go Direct to Savings. Coupons include Follistim Manufacturer Coupon. I have a breakdown of these options on the second tab of the pricing doc (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BM7Jm3ENWHoPRj6DXSQ4Pudj_WCGschllDKJkVCq1Q4/edit?usp=sharing).

- Common IVF drugs include Gonadotropins (which stimulate ovaries) that go under the medication names “Follistim”, “Gonal-F”, “Bravelle”, and “Menopur”; HCG (makes eggs mature) which include the meds “Profasi”, “Novarel”, “Ovidrel,” and “Pregnyl”; GnRH-antagoinists (prevent premature ovulation) which include the meds “Ganirelix” and “Cetrotide.”

- Different specialty pharmacies work with different drug companies, so some pharmacies will have better prices on certain meds. (Example: Metro Drugs in NY is a Design Rx pharmacy and has low prices on Follistim but much higher prices on Gonal-F.) If you find a pharmacy with a good price but it’s not the medication you were prescribed, ask your RE if you can switch.

- Don’t assume that your RE has all the information about drug pricing. My RE’s office staff had never heard of IVF Greenlight, and they were all shocked to learn that Costco carried Femara (at $2!). My RE pushed us to go with Mandell’s for IVF drugs, but I later they have a relationship with them. Ultimately you as the patient should get to decide.

- You may get a price break if you are a cash paying patient.


- For the pricing doc (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BM7Jm3ENWHoPRj6DXSQ4Pudj_WCGschllDKJkVCq1Q4/edit?usp=sharing), I found the best prices for a US-based pharmacy through Metro Drugs in New York for my specific meds/quantities. The second best US-based pharmacy prices I found were tied -- Freedom Fertility and Mandell’s had the exact same pricing.  

- For the pricing doc: my meds are a higher dose for someone my age (31) because I have a low AMH/ am a low responder and my parter has MFI (low morphology).

- For the pricing doc: there are lots and lots of other speciality pharmacies that I did not list. I started to researching them-- many are regional. Ultimately, none of them except for Metro Drugs was the only place for my meds that lower prices than Freedom & Mandell's

- About the pricing doc: I sometimes listed only the med that had the best price, and sometimes listed the price for all meds. The total at the bottom is the cheapest options within each drug category.

<li><p>Common IVF drugs include Gonadotropins (which stimulate ovaries) that go under the medication names “Follistim”, “Gonal-F”, “Bravelle”, and “Menopur”; HCG (makes eggs mature) which include the meds “Profasi”, “Novarel”, “Ovidrel,” and “Pregnyl”; GnRH-antagoinists (prevent premature ovulation) which include the meds “Ganirelix” and “Cetrotide.”</p></li>
<li><p>Different specialty pharmacies work with different drug companies, so some pharmacies will have better prices on certain meds. (Example: Metro Drugs in NY is a Design Rx pharmacy and has low prices on Follistim but much higher prices on Gonal-F.) If you find a pharmacy with a good price but it’s not the medication you were prescribed, ask your RE if you can switch.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t assume that your RE has all the information about drug pricing. My RE’s office staff had never heard of IVF Greenlight, and they were all shocked to learn that Costco carried Femara (at $2!). My RE pushed us to go with Mandell’s for IVF drugs, but I later they have a relationship with them. Ultimately you as the patient should get to decide.</p></li>
<li><p>You may get a price break if you are a cash paying patient.</p></li>
<li><p>For the pricing doc (<a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BM7Jm3ENWHoPRj6DXSQ4Pudj_WCGschllDKJkVCq1Q4/edit?usp=sharing"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BM7Jm3ENWHoPRj6DXSQ4Pudj_WCGschllDKJkVCq1Q4/edit?usp=sharing</a>), I found the best prices for a US-based pharmacy through Metro Drugs in New York for my specific meds/quantities. The second best US-based pharmacy prices I found were tied -- Freedom Fertility and Mandell’s had the exact same pricing.  </p></li>
<li><p>For the pricing doc: my meds are a higher dose for someone my age (31) because I have a low AMH/ am a low responder and my parter has MFI (low morphology).</p></li>
<li><p>For the pricing doc: there are lots and lots of other speciality pharmacies that I did not list. I started to researching them-- many are regional. Ultimately, none of them except for Metro Drugs was the only place for my meds that lower prices than Freedom &amp; Mandell&#39;s</p></li>
<li><p>About the pricing doc: I sometimes listed only the med that had the best price, and sometimes listed the price for all meds. The total at the bottom is the cheapest options within each drug category. </p></li>

The Many Other Sorts of Waiting

------------


/u/LaDamedanslAuto: Seeing the RE at the end of march, to get protocol for FET 2 (after the massive fail of FET 1).

/u/imissmycoffee: Waiting for FET #1 in mid-March.

/u/salty-lemons: Waiting for CD1 so I can start birth control for IVF #3. Siiiiigh. Should be some time mid March-ish.

/u/all7dwarves: FET now postponed until May. Wait Wait Wait.

/u/TTC8508: On progesterone to force a period and get more invasive testing done, to begin Clomid in April- at the beginning of infertility journey.

/u/MBel312: Saving up for IVF with donor egg.

/u/elcagey2: Husbands varicocelectomy on March 16th!

/u/treacheroushuevos: 4 embryos to be PGS tested -- results 3/8.

/u/allbustnoballs: I'm not waiting on anything exciting this month. Just waiting to get a CD1 back after my miscarriage so we can plan the next steps.

/u/Passiflora15:  The 2 week post-op appointment with my surgeon is on 03/09 and I am assuming I'll met back with my RE after that. Then it's onward and upward to IVF. 

/u/pinksultana: Working on losing 8kg more to qualify for iui/IVF and get that ball rolling.

/u/emberella: On birth control, waiting to start injections for first round of IVF - retrieval date will be in April so I have a little while to wait still.

/u/MolinasMitt: February natural cycle was a bust (no shocker there) and My appointment for the 24th of Feb was canceled but I should be getting clomid on my next Dr appointment on the 7th.. Just hoping my period holds off a few more days so I don't have to wait another whole month to do my first clomid cycle.

/u/mmabpa: Waiting for AF to start birth control for IVF #1.

/u/Alces_alces_: Another natural cycle while we wait for husband to do SA at the three month post-surgery mark (which will be sometime this month)

/u/centernova: Waiting for my ovarian cyst to resolve.

/u/Been_there_done_this: Waiting for IVF #1 appointment, hopefully April (after 7 months wait). Currently cycle 29, more than 2 years of trying

/u/ggmbb: We have an appointment with second opinion RE on 7 April. Currently requesting records from our clinic so hopefully I don't have to go through a million zillion tests again.

/u/clevermermaid: Didn't even have to go to my appointment to get a BFN today because I started. Cycle Day 1. 1st IUI failed. Because of my low AMH and slightly high FSH, we're jumping straight to IVF. Starting this week if everything goes as planned.

/u/baumee: I have my first D&C on Tuesday. They're screening me for endometrial cancer. I just got my pre-op test results though and my LDH is high, so it's not looking too good from here...",t2_6dcf0,False,,0,False,March Waiting,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_48a1bq,False,dark,0.91,,public,9,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,self,1458487974.0,,[],{},,True,,1456778796.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Welcome to the March 2016 Waiting thread!</p>

209,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So our story starts in June 2013, husband and I enjoying what I now know as naive, ""it will happen soon"" baby making sex, we learn that 2 1/2 years in we need science if we are going to have a child of our own. 
My husband and I got married not long after my little sister tied the knot, of course there was ""baby"" talk soon after, my sister and her husband decided to not wait around and after talking to me about trying to get pregnant over the Spring of that year, she fell pregnant more or less straight away, brilliant news, only now it was becoming more and more apparent that we were not pregnant.

 My dad in the middle of all this is diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer.

I approached my Doctor who told me he would do everything he can for us but his hands are tied until we hit the 2 year mark, we are both in our early 30's. 

Time passes, I start to eat my feelings, I put on weight,  many bingo's were had, to start with I actually found myself embarrassed for them, then I hit a wall, I never explained our problems, I am quite a private person but people asking questions had to stop, I don't think I will ever regret some of the things I came out with, it was then I realised how into other people's business, people could actually be. 

So husband and I go back to the doctor, we have hit the 2 year milestone and can now move forward with explorative tests, it ends with us learning that our reproductive problems start and end with me,  my body needs to be looked at in more detail, I am told a Laparoscopy is the only way forward, I have never had any form of surgery before, nor been put under a general anaesthetic

The day of my Lap, husband and I go to the day surgery unit which is located in a standalone building across a carpark at the other end of the main hospital, I go in, I get prepped by the nurses and have a talk with the doctor doing the procedure, she says she will just make two incisions, have a look around and take it from there, I was told it should take roughly 20-30 mins depending on what they find, into recovery and then home, so nothing to really worry about. I learn I am last in the queue, at 5pm I go in, I am walked through to the theatre, the room is a hive of activity, the two doctors, a few nurses, all being lovely and calm, I voice my concern about not being put under before so a nurse holds my hand as I drift off, which in itself was bizarre,  I like to be in control, this was definitely out of my comfort zone!

So the next thing I am aware of is waking up in a bed, in what I believed to be the recovery area of the day surgery unit, the clock on the wall in front of me says 3oclock, but didn't I go in at 5pm? My mind is groggy and I can't seem to figure it out, it was like I had all the answers but I couldn't put everything together in the right order, the blinds were closed and for a day surgery unit it was awfully quiet. 

I then realize I really need to pee, I have an IV in attached to a bag on wheels, I then go to sit forward, it felt like my insides were burning and tearing, it hurt like hell! with the help of a nurse I eventually get out of bed and shuffle across the room, time disappears, I am offered a few different types of painkillers and over next few hours, I just rinse and repeat the above scenario.

Eventually at about 12pm, I get to go home. It's then, after the drugs wear off that I learn exactly what happened and how out of it I actually was, Once they opened me up they realized that the situation was quite bad, four incisions in total were made, I had adhesions everywhere, things were stuck fast to one another and that both my tubes were blocked, the doctor had tried to do her best to free up as much as possible, she tried to fire dye through both my tubes with no luck, things then backfired for me and I ended up becoming a human colander, a hole was punched through the wall of my uterus with the end of a catheter,  I have been told they can't tell me if it will cause issues if I was to get pregnant, due to the area in which it happened, they have no numbers. I'm hopeful, it's a wall of muscle, how bad can it be!?

I was in surgery for just over 2 hours, I don't remember anything, at about 7.15pm I was wheeled out of surgery and into recovery in the day unit, I was the last one there, apparently at some point a nurse put an oxygen mask on my face, and were stood around talking about how I had been in there for 2 hours, according to my husband I pulled off the mask, sat upright in bed and shouted quite loudly ""2 hours is a bloody long time!"" the nurse laughed and said they would let me have that one as I was so out of it! 

At 9pm they decided to keep me knocked out, they wheeled me in a bed out of the day surgery unit, locking the door and saying goodbye to a couple of the nurses who went home, we went across the road and through a carpark into  the main building, the room I woke up in was at the other end of the main building, where I had my own bathroom and bedroom to myself.

I ended up having 10 weeks off work as I had quite a physical job at the time and required help just getting both up and down from the sofa, I slept sitting up in bed for a while, the scars are still apparent, occasionally even pain in the general area,  it was a deeply unpleasant experience as I like to be able to do things for myself, asking for help is not something I can do easily. 

I consider us very lucky as we live in the UK and have two rounds of IVF on the NHS.

My little sister is now pregnant with her second and will again manage a spring birth in a couple of months after moving into her dream house in her dream location.  I'm not bitter, not bitter at all! I really do not like the person this is turning me into, I am pleased for her but managing my feelings is becoming a full time job. 
I am very close to starting our 1st IVF journey, have had planning, just waiting on the app to teach me how to inject in the next week, I'm dealing with it the only way I know how, head and down push on through to the other side, it's going to be bumpy ride.

My husband and I got married not long after my little sister tied the knot, of course there was &quot;baby&quot; talk soon after, my sister and her husband decided to not wait around and after talking to me about trying to get pregnant over the Spring of that year, she fell pregnant more or less straight away, brilliant news, only now it was becoming more and more apparent that we were not pregnant.</p>

<p>My dad in the middle of all this is diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer.</p>

<p>I approached my Doctor who told me he would do everything he can for us but his hands are tied until we hit the 2 year mark, we are both in our early 30&#39;s. </p>

<p>Time passes, I start to eat my feelings, I put on weight,  many bingo&#39;s were had, to start with I actually found myself embarrassed for them, then I hit a wall, I never explained our problems, I am quite a private person but people asking questions had to stop, I don&#39;t think I will ever regret some of the things I came out with, it was then I realised how into other people&#39;s business, people could actually be. </p>

<p>So husband and I go back to the doctor, we have hit the 2 year milestone and can now move forward with explorative tests, it ends with us learning that our reproductive problems start and end with me,  my body needs to be looked at in more detail, I am told a Laparoscopy is the only way forward, I have never had any form of surgery before, nor been put under a general anaesthetic</p>

<p>The day of my Lap, husband and I go to the day surgery unit which is located in a standalone building across a carpark at the other end of the main hospital, I go in, I get prepped by the nurses and have a talk with the doctor doing the procedure, she says she will just make two incisions, have a look around and take it from there, I was told it should take roughly 20-30 mins depending on what they find, into recovery and then home, so nothing to really worry about. I learn I am last in the queue, at 5pm I go in, I am walked through to the theatre, the room is a hive of activity, the two doctors, a few nurses, all being lovely and calm, I voice my concern about not being put under before so a nurse holds my hand as I drift off, which in itself was bizarre,  I like to be in control, this was definitely out of my comfort zone!</p>

<p>So the next thing I am aware of is waking up in a bed, in what I believed to be the recovery area of the day surgery unit, the clock on the wall in front of me says 3oclock, but didn&#39;t I go in at 5pm? My mind is groggy and I can&#39;t seem to figure it out, it was like I had all the answers but I couldn&#39;t put everything together in the right order, the blinds were closed and for a day surgery unit it was awfully quiet. </p>

212,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Long, sorry. 

I’m on a much-needed trip to my hometown to see my beloved parents and friends. (And I’m ovulating while I’m here…uggggh.) ANYway, I just got back from a get-together with two girlfriends, my mom, and one of their moms. 

Let’s give people fake names:

Sonja – one teenage son, one MC. Her mom, Danielle – two adult kids including Sonja.

Maggie – two young sons, including one she conceived the month she started trying. Maggie is a doting mother, but her useless in-laws cannot stop popping out babies that get ignored or exploited.

And my mom. My parents have no idea Mr. CCC is dealing with MFI because they have a long history of panicking the fuck out for months, obsessing over ridiculous “solutions,” and broadcasting it to family across several continents when anything goes even slightly wrong with me. If we ever want a moment’s peace again, we will never tell them about the MFI.

Maggie brought one of her little sons to this get-together at the last-second because Mr. Maggie cannot watch both kids as he is helping paint his parents’ home, where all the baby-popping siblings live and suddenly baby #7 (seven) on the way apparently means that the house needs fresh paint.

Sonja and Danielle pumped me for information on what’s happening, now that we’re almost at Year 6 of trying without even a scare. After getting grilled about fertility testing, I broke enough to say that we’re under a doctor’s care but “everything that should be there is there.” (Gray lie – his SA has all the numbers. Just not high numbers.) 

I also had to explain:

- IVF is expensive and does not always work.

- Adoption is also expensive and does not always work. 

- Adoption does not 100% of the time magically trigger “a baby right afterward.”

- We have been in life crisis mode almost the entire time we have been trying. “Just relax” will never apply to us unless people stop dying, or our industries stop having layoffs, or landlords stop stalking us, or parents stop going into the hospital, or etc. etc. etc.


I also got a “well maybe you are not meant to have kids” from Danielle. While Maggie sat there frowning as we had just discussed the seven babies and the paint job.

In the middle of all this, I snuck a glance at my mom. She was staring at the ground, arms and feet crossed. My heart imploded. Mom is a “child whisperer” and was born to be a grandmother. She has never, once, said a word to me about wanting grandkids, but she does not have to. She echoed feebly the “maybe it is not meant to be” sentence, without looking at me. 

I’m back at my parents' house now, numb and tired. I’m going to dinner with another friend (single and child-free) shortly. I’m too exhausted to drink, but if I were home, I’d be whipping up a cocktail right quick.

Once I decided to get pregnant, of course I went to Penn Fertility since they had all my records and tests over the years etc. Made sense.

I posted a while back about them refusing to do an IUI with 4 eggs on Femara. (I'm on Cycle day 1, for anyone who was wondering - we had lots of sex, but I ovulated late, so we missed it). I feel like I know my body, but they won't listen. For example, I didn't get any positive OPKs with the Femara and 4 eggs and I was past cycle day 20. I know me, with the PCOS and even on Femara I sometimes am a late ovulator. I called and asked for a CD 21 blood test to confirm ovulation.

The difference was unbelievable.

They didn't think it was needed....well, my HSG is this coming Friday. The doctor couldn't believe with my mom and sister having severe endo that I was never checked for blocked tubes.

The best part was, he told me and my husband it's his absolute goal to get us pregnant on the first attempt. Maybe some people wouldn't like that bold approach, but I'll tell you I loved it. He gave me more faith than Penn ever did.

I was really nervous to make the switch, but I do feel like I'm in great hands.

For those of you who have taken lovenox (or clexane) when in your transfer cycle did you start it?

I am heterogeneous for PAI-1, and my RE said if I wanted to, I could start lovenox if I ever get a positive beta again (he said that he wasn't sure it would do me any good, or was necessary, but I was pushing him to suggest a change to my protocol out of desperation and he said he was okay with lovenox mostly because it wouldn't hurt and might help me psychologically and theoretically could actually help prevent miscarriage).

Meanwhile, the miscarriage specialist I am consulting with is testing my ANA this weekend, and if it is abnormal, he wants me to start Lovenox the day of my transfer (Wednesday).

So, conflicting opinions as when to start. Others who have taken it, can I ask when you took it and what, if anything, it was prescribed for?

I went back to work on the third day after my lap and that was probably too soon.  I really could have used another day or two off.  Wearing normal clothes kind of sucked and I felt utterly exhausted.  I would come home, immediately change into PJs, and lay on the couch and let my husband serve me.  I highly recommend that last part.  I have a very sedentary job, so if your job is active, I would highly recommend 3-5 days off work.

I attempted to stop taking my prescription pain meds 2 days after surgery.  That was a mistake. I wasn't in intense pain so I felt like I didn't need it, but the low grade pain would grind on me until I felt depressed.  Then I would take a pain pill, pain would go away along with the depression.  I ended up taking 2-3 pills (Norco 5) per day until a week after the surgery and then no longer needed it.  Getting out of bed in the morning was painful for about 9-10 days.  The area under the incision felt like a burn, not a cut, very odd sensation.  I continued to have muscle soreness (felt like a pulled muscle) for about 3 weeks, but nothing terrible.  I was able to sneeze without pain about 2.5 weeks after the surgery.  My bladder mildly hurt/ached to pee for about 3 weeks.  It felt like I was getting a UTI but without the pain in the urethra.  

I bled and spotted for about a week and I had super gentle sex 9 days after the surgery and normal sex 2 weeks after without issue.

I got my period 2 days late.  My period was pretty normal for me.  I have 2 days of heavy flow and then a day or two of light flow or spotting.  It was no more or less painful than before.

Since that first [unbelievably awful poo](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/44shyy/lets_talk_about_the_old_number_two/), things have been normal in that department as well.

My belly button looks normal.  The other two incisions are just at the line of my pubic hair so I think once the hair grows back, the scars will be hidden entirely.

I underestimated what this surgery would be like.  I read about it and saw it called 'bandaid surgery' (because the incisions are so small they put bandaids over the incisions) and thought 'eh, no big deal!'.  Therefore I did not schedule any time off or continue taking pain medications for a reasonable length of time (at first).  Yes, the incisions are tiny but the RE still took a burning laser to my insides, bashed around my ovaries, scrambled my endometrial lining, and poked holes through my abdomen.

My husband has seen a urologist twice now after finding out about his low motility and low sperm count.  Tests show his testosterone levels are low, but his doctor said that he does not want to put him on testosterone supplements since it might actually lower his count even further.  So, now we're both on clomid.  My doctor wanted me to continue taking it since ""it really only takes one sperm,"" but honestly, I hate taking it.  I'm one of the lucky few that gets the rare side-effect of breast pain...really bad breast pain.  I can't even stand the spray of the water in the shower on my chest.

My husband is staying optimistic.  He still hopeful we'll get pregnant before May.  The plan is still to go see a RE doctor in Mexico then if I'm not pregnant to start IVF.  My hope is that the visits to the urologist just improve his counts enough that it's easier to undergo IVF.

Truth is I'm acting happy and optimistic on the outside, but I'm starting to just...give up.  Last night I asked my husband what would happen if we didn't get pregnant and he didn't want to discuss it and just said, ""We will.""  I left it at that because I don't want to put too much pressure on him.  I know that he feels badly since he keeps telling me that he's sorry that he's ""broken"" since he's the one with the issue.

My husband has seen a urologist twice now after finding out about his low motility and low sperm count.  Tests show his testosterone levels are low, but his doctor said that he does not want to put him on testosterone supplements since it might actually lower his count even further.  So, now we&#39;re both on clomid.  My doctor wanted me to continue taking it since &quot;it really only takes one sperm,&quot; but honestly, I hate taking it.  I&#39;m one of the lucky few that gets the rare side-effect of breast pain...really bad breast pain.  I can&#39;t even stand the spray of the water in the shower on my chest.</p>

<p>My husband is staying optimistic.  He still hopeful we&#39;ll get pregnant before May.  The plan is still to go see a RE doctor in Mexico then if I&#39;m not pregnant to start IVF.  My hope is that the visits to the urologist just improve his counts enough that it&#39;s easier to undergo IVF.</p>

<p>Truth is I&#39;m acting happy and optimistic on the outside, but I&#39;m starting to just...give up.  Last night I asked my husband what would happen if we didn&#39;t get pregnant and he didn&#39;t want to discuss it and just said, &quot;We will.&quot;  I left it at that because I don&#39;t want to put too much pressure on him.  I know that he feels badly since he keeps telling me that he&#39;s sorry that he&#39;s &quot;broken&quot; since he&#39;s the one with the issue.</p>

(I hope that doesn't offend anyone; I only wanted to make use of an alliteration. They make my heart happy)

I had to take an unexpected 3 week hiatus, mostly because of work. I had a big project I needed to send off to print. I thought the work was due in April, turns out it was MARCH! Ahhh! So, I cut the social and Reddit cords to hunker down, work some 15-hour days and get shit done. Which I did. Sent that mother off to print yesterday. Felt real good y'all, real good. 

In my absence I turned 33 and the husband turned 38. I re-did CD3 blood work, and we did genetic carrier screening. My new RE, Dr. Awesomesauce was concerned I was a Fragile X carrier because my reserve is so low. Let's talk about that...

I had my first CD3 labs in July of 2015, see the numbers below compared with my new lab results from January 2016:

FSH: 9.6-->10.2

**AMH: 0.99-->0.5**

Estradiol: 71-->65


Good news is I am not a Fragile X carrier, neither me nor my husband are carriers for anything they tested for. Sadly, that's where the good news ends. 

When my AMH came back so low, Dr. Awesomesauce sent us for the genetic testing. His thought was Fragile X would explain my rapidly declining reserve. But, nope. I *did* have a lap to remove an endometrioma on my right ovary back in October. Any ovarian surgery will reduce reserve. Period. But, he thinks the drop in AMH cannot be entirely explained by the lap. So, we're dealing with unexplained premature diminished ovarian reserve. We all know the next place for me is strait-up premature ovarian failure. Fortunately, I'm still ovulating on my own and I'm very regular. Our RE is cautiously optimistic. 

The plan? He recommends one injectable IUI cycle. That's right just one before moving on to IVF. He said we're not going to waste any more time with Clomid TI or IUIs. Whew, *fuck that drug y'all.* He said we've got about a 25% chance with injectable IUI, and if it fails, then we will have much information gathered to apply to an IVF protocol. Right now, before knowing how/if I'll respond to the injectable gonadotropins, he gives IVF a 35-37% chance of success, but he was clear to say that percentage will go up or down depending how my response to the injectable IUI. Also, since there's clearly something going on with my eggs, he recommends PGS testing any embryos we might get. Of course, if we get embryos to test, and they come back chromosomally normal, that ups our chances of an FET success to 70%. But, there are a lot of ""if's"" getting there. 


Real talk: 

I'm down for the injectable IUI. I'm CD14 now and should have my baseline in 12-14 days. Husband is all about giving me the injections too :). I'm not excited about the progesterone; he said they use jelly, not suppositories or injections. But, why should you gals have all the fun? I have a fear that the IUI will work and we'll have the most amazing baby ever and then, when we want another, my reserve will be so low that IVF won't even be an option then. The RE said that was a valid fear, since they don't know why my supply is so quickly dropping, and my endo will likely be back by then. 

Honestly though, I'm not sure if I'll do IVF. I think seeing my response to the gonadotropins will help us decide, but if our chances stay below 50%, I'll probably bow out of this race. Sad to think about that. I know I've announced on this sub that I'd decided I'm willing to do IVF (long time IVF fence sitter here), and I am, but now that we have this new information, well, it might not be worth 20k+. We would need the most expensive microflare protocol, then probably more drugs, then PGS, then ICSI required for PGS...for possibly less than 40% chance of success? I'm not sure I could handle that kind of failure. The stakes would be so high, and the fall would be so low. Also, I can't spend the rest of my *youth* in treatment. I can't compartmentalize this. I'm all in or all out. It's so hard to live life fully while still trying to have a baby. I don't know how so many of you do it. 

More so, husband and I have been fighting a lot lately because I can't process my emotions in a healthy way and he doesn't have a lot of patience for depression. He says baby or no baby he wants us to to be happy again. I'm fearful he wants a baby more than he's letting on, but those are his emotions; I can't assume anything more than he tells me. For me, baby = happy, no treatment = happy; treatment = not happy.

I wanted to share what happened when I took the advice to take some space from that friend that peed on my pregnancy tests and announced her pregnancy at my party. To keep it simple, I'm going to copy/paste the police statement I had to give today, changing names for privacy.

After being accused of causing someone's miscarriage by wishing it, after being called awful names and being told someone hopes I never ever have a child, I am feeling really really down.

The statement:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bev is someone that I met in high school, though we were never really friends until the summer of 2015 when we connected on Facebook. On Sunday, February 14th, 2016, I had some friends over to my house for my annual “commercial love day baking” get together. Bev was one of those guests. She had gone to my bathroom, and she used two of my pregnancy tests that were in the cabinet. She called me down to show me, and then showed me photos of her previously taken positive pregnancy tests. I am a woman who has been struggling with infertility for two years and Bev is well aware of this. I did not react negatively in any way towards her that day. When the other guests arrived, Bev went on about her pregnancy throughout the afternoon. For personal reasons, it was difficult for me to digest and after speaking with some women that are experiencing similar infertility struggles, I was advised to take some time and distance myself from Bev for a little while until I was ready. I was responding to her regular conversational text messages in a normal fashion last week until she started asking me about my doctor’s appointments. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, and that’s where I stopped responding to Bev’s messages on my iphone and Facebook.

On Sunday, February 21st, that’s when the messages from Bev and her boyfriend, Chris, became unfriendly. Bev started messaging John (my husband) on Facebook Messenger asking for a response from me. John did not respond. Chris then phoned John (at 8:45PM), to which John did not answer. At this point, John responded to Bev on Facebook Messenger explaining to her that I was upset due to Bev coming to my house and using two of my pregnancy tests and gloating about her pregnancy all afternoon when she knows that I am struggling with infertility, and that I needed space and wanted to be left alone to process my feelings, and I will contact her when I am ready. This was our first time asking to be left alone. Bev responded with a long message generally stating that she was sorry she hurt me and that looks forward to hearing back from me “when she (me) is ready…""

Monday at 11:56AM, John received a text on his iphone from Chris telling us that we were jealous of Bev’s pregnancy and that I need to talk to Bev because she is extremely upset. 

Chris also told John that Bev suffers from what is known as Borderline Personality Disorder.

John messaged Chris back (at 1:02PM) and asked for them to leave us alone a second time. John blocked Chris on his iphone at this point. Bev messaged John again. John and I blocked Bev and her boyfriend Chris on all social media and iphones. 

On Monday, February 22nd, at 2:30pm, we received an email at our joined address, meandhusband@gmail.com from Bev. She was verbally abusive in telling me how I am a terrible friend who does not care about her and if I do not contact her, she threatened to phone my mother and tell her about the infertility problems that my husband and I had been keeping private. She said that she’s been talking to several of her friends about what a terrible friend I am. She also told me that this was the last time she would contact me. We immediately returned her Medela breast pump machine that she had asked for in her email. After we returned the machine, I emailed Bev at 4:27PM, expressing my feelings that I wanted space and would have contacted her when I was ready, but after her threats to go to my family, I cannot come back from that nastiness. 

Bev emailed me again at 5:05pm expressing her distraught state and using a few insults, end with “have a good one, wish you the best"". We did not respond. 

Bev emailed again at 5:27pm expressing more distraught emotions, ending her email with “I’m just going to let you heal and try to forget as well.” We did not respond.

Bev emailed again at 5:38pm with screenshots of her text conversations with her friends discussing my intimate personal life (my infertility journey). We did not respond.

Bev emailed me this morning, February 23rd, at 6:57am, telling me that she is having a miscarriage so now I don’t have to feel bad for not having a baby. Bev included pictures of blood and blood clots on tissue paper. We did not respond.

Bev emailed me at 6:58am. We did not respond.

Bev emailed me at 8:53am saying, “Just really wish I had you to talk to right now."" We did not respond. 

Bev emailed me at 10:40am saying, ""Wow!!! I'm nasty?!?!!!! You are a major insensitive bitch!!! I just had a miscarriage and you can't say anything to me? I hope you never have fucking kids you little fucking bitch. I'm calling your mother you fucking little whore!!!” We did not respond. 

Bev emailed me at 10:42am saying, ""You must be sitting on your Little happy horse wishing everyone kids death. I can't believe you!!! You two I wish I never met”. We did not respond. 

Bev then phoned my mother while she was at work and told her about how I have been struggling with infertility and I am trying to have a baby (which my mother did not know yet) and how I cut Bev out of my life when she needed a friend during her miscarriage. 

I spoke with my mother at 3:30pm to clear the air and explain that Bev may not be in her right mind so please be careful.

Because this situation escalated so quickly and Bev’s actions were becoming more and more destructive of my personal life and well being, I decided to seek help from the authorities. I went to the Police office, and phoned the non-emergency number I was given at 4:40pm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The police said that they paid ""Bev"" a visit and explained to her to leave me alone. If she comes near me or my house or messages me again, I can phone the police and they will come within minutes, and they will help me file a permanent restraining order. If she breaches a restraining order, she goes straight to jail. 

I am feeling so so so gross inside. I am so glad my husband is here with cheesecake and my dog is glued to my side. It's almost like my dog knows something's up... he has been so calm and mellow and staying out of the way and not leaving my side for a second.

Doc said I could do injections or suppositories for progesterone.
I chose injections because about 12 years ago I was traumatised by a suppository I was prescribed for a yeast infection. Not only was it horrendously sticky and itchy, I had no idea there would be so much leakage. Within the first few hours of using it, I had leakage in my favorite jeans from Japan that ended up cracking the fabric and tearing holes in the crotch. Ugh. I swore never again. What an uncomfortable nightmare.

But since my first injection yesterday in my thigh, I've come to realize these bitches hurt the next day. The injection itself was fine and there is no bruise but it feels like someone punched me in the leg today. I did the second one on my other leg today, and this time iced it first and put a heat pad after. Hopefully that will help.

Does anyone have a system where you do right leg, left leg, R arm, L arm, R glute, L glute? Does that help if each site is only once every 6 days? Any other tips? These are way shittier than the stims in my opinion.

Also, I have a  trip where I'll be away for about 5 days soon and am thinking to use suppositories for simplicity. Are they usually one a day, or multiple times a day?

What an uncomfortable nightmare.</p>

<p>But since my first injection yesterday in my thigh, I&#39;ve come to realize these bitches hurt the next day. The injection itself was fine and there is no bruise but it feels like someone punched me in the leg today. I did the second one on my other leg today, and this time iced it first and put a heat pad after. Hopefully that will help.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a system where you do right leg, left leg, R arm, L arm, R glute, L glute? Does that help if each site is only once every 6 days? Any other tips? These are way shittier than the stims in my opinion.</p>

<p>Also, I have a  trip where I&#39;ll be away for about 5 days soon and am thinking to use suppositories for simplicity. Are they usually one a day, or multiple times a day?
Thanks!</p>

Wife had 11 eggs retrieved, 8 mature, 6 fertilized.  We had 4 left for a day 5 transfer, and this is where things just went downhill.

There's been no talk of other procedures like PESA, etc. and I don't know why they're dismissed by our doc.

 - Any success stories about blockage repair on here?  Any words of wisdom for pursuing this line of treatment?

 - About how long do you all typically wait between cycles?  We're moving in a couple of months are were really hoping to get in one more cycle at our current clinic, but that may not be possible.

279,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi there everyone..First time posting here.  My wife and I have been TTC for 8 months now. I know its not that long but it feels like forever.  In an effort to make sure everything is OK on my end, I went to my Primary Care Physician last week to get a semen analysis.  My doc called me on Friday morning with the news that my sperm had low motility.  I apologize in advance but I don't have the exact numbers available as I just requested last night that the doctor mail them to me.  As you can expect this news devastated me.  

Before I go on let me tell you a little about myself.  I don't drink alcohol or use tobacco.  My stress levels are pretty low.  My BMI is 21.8 and I exercise regularly.  My go to exercise is cycling, in which I am probably on the bike between 3-4 hours a week and more in the spring/summer.  I love doing it and it keeps me happy.

Moving on...My doc knew ahead of the results that I'm an avid cyclist.  So when she got the results I know she did a quick ""low sperm motility cycling"" search which produced several links to a study in which she brought up on the call to go over the results. http://road.cc/content/news/28391-five-hours-cycling-week-makes-your-sperm-less-active-says-study  She informed me that this is likely the cause of my motility issue. Just hearing of this news I knew what the doc was suggesting and what was going to be expected of me in order to continue TTC with my wife...give up the bike until pregnant.  

While at first I was totally fine with this in order to get my wife pregnant, but the more I thought about it the more I became unsatisfied with the information at hand.  I began researching obsessively for low motility causes.  I came across fertility doctors blogs, more research, and a million things in between.  What I've came away from this knowing is the following:

-The cycling and low motility research is more or less inconclusive and the people in the referenced study were already getting an SA for one reason or another related to infertility.  If anything I should look into getting the fit on my bike looked at for safe measures.

-My doctor should have suggested getting a second SA done due to the unreliability of an SA in general

-Vitamins, take them!!  I started taking a Mens multivitamin which includes Vit C and B12.

-I wear briefs (thin, synthetic, breathable) and skinny jeans and sit in an office chair most of the day.  I probably need to change this more than anything.  Thoughts?

Anyways, I informed my wife last night that I was not satisfied with the docs suggestion, given that it is not her area of specialty.  My wife wasn't happy that I was doubting the doctors suggestion and thought I was just looking for a reason to get back on the bike...we're now fighting.  While part of what my wife thinks may be true, I really just want to get to the root cause of this.  Lets say I give up the bike for 3 month and get another SA and the results are the same.  At this point we'll know its not cycling related due to the ~70 days it takes to make sperm.  I'll then have given up cycling for 3 months for no reason, motility is still low, and we're no closer to pregnancy than we were 3 months ago.  

In conclusion, I'm not really sure why I'm posting here...maybe to vent, maybe support, advice?  My head hasn't been clear since getting the news and its kept me up the past 2 nights.  As mentioned previously, my wife and I are now fighting over this which is just fantastic on top of everything else.  I know we'll make up eventually but it's not something I need right now.  So that's where I'm at right now and I'm not 100% sure of what our next steps should be.

It was a sort of odd but also kind of great bonding experience as it helped us to feel that we aren&#39;t the only ones out there. We really enjoy hanging out with this couple but my wife also doesn&#39;t want the friendship to be too much about IF and instead wants it to be more positive. Anybody else have any experience with something like this? </p>

291,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I posted yesterday about preparing for ER. Here's how it went today:

We are done. It all went well. For those who may be interested, we went in at 8am today, after 8 hours of fasting/no water. The gave us ourr hospital gowns, caps, and some booties to keep our feet warm. After getting our I.V.s in, they wheeled me into the surgical room around 9am. I got on the table, got situated in the stirrups, I vaguely remember them washing me  and the next thing I knew, they were waking me to move me back on to the gurney to wheel me out. It was about 9:30. I saw my husband and said I was fine and then they took him for his biopsy. I was kind of drifting in and out and he was done about 20/30mins later. So by 10am we were both side by side on our gurneys recovering. 
We napped for about an hour, and then we were both  hungry and just ready to get out of there. The heart rate monitor was so loud, it kept waking me up. About 11:30, they took out the IVs, gave us some juice (the most delicious mango juice my parched throat has ever known) and then took us to a different recovery room for us to change and wait for the doc. They also didn't want either of us driving yet. Three episodes of friends later, the doc came in around 2pm and told me they had gotten 15 eggs. For my husband, they took two samples - one for now and one to freeze. Seems like the samples did not have a much sperm but it should be fine for ICSI. He is planning a 3 day transfer for Thursday and we can decide if we want to transfer 2 or 3 embryos, all depending on how things go between now and then, of course.

Overall, not bad. Neither of us seems to have had issues with the anesthesia. They kept asking if we were nauseous and we were both ok. Husband is icing his injury, says it's not bad. I feel overall fine - kind of the same as yesterday - I just feel like my ovaries are swollen and uncomfortable. It's a bit worse when walking, but when sitting down, it's fine. I've had period cramps that were way worse. I had a teeny bit of spotting. 

My one thing I would do next time - bring a book, and some earplugs to block out the damn heart monitor so I could sleep! The worse part of it all was just the waiting around....

Oh, and when I got there, the nurse told me to take my wedding rings off. No can do, especially with IVF bloat. She made it sound like it was going to be a big deal and now my finger is sore and swollen from trying to get them off. In the end, the surgeon didn't care about that at all. My advice - if your rings are at all tight, remove them before even starting the IVF cycle. Wish I had!

Here&#39;s how it went today:</p>

<p>We are done. It all went well. For those who may be interested, we went in at 8am today, after 8 hours of fasting/no water. The gave us ourr hospital gowns, caps, and some booties to keep our feet warm. After getting our I.V.s in, they wheeled me into the surgical room around 9am. I got on the table, got situated in the stirrups, I vaguely remember them washing me  and the next thing I knew, they were waking me to move me back on to the gurney to wheel me out. It was about 9:30. I saw my husband and said I was fine and then they took him for his biopsy. I was kind of drifting in and out and he was done about 20/30mins later. So by 10am we were both side by side on our gurneys recovering. 
We napped for about an hour, and then we were both  hungry and just ready to get out of there. The heart rate monitor was so loud, it kept waking me up. About 11:30, they took out the IVs, gave us some juice (the most delicious mango juice my parched throat has ever known) and then took us to a different recovery room for us to change and wait for the doc. They also didn&#39;t want either of us driving yet. Three episodes of friends later, the doc came in around 2pm and told me they had gotten 15 eggs. For my husband, they took two samples - one for now and one to freeze. Seems like the samples did not have a much sperm but it should be fine for ICSI. He is planning a 3 day transfer for Thursday and we can decide if we want to transfer 2 or 3 embryos, all depending on how things go between now and then, of course.</p>

<p>Overall, not bad. Neither of us seems to have had issues with the anesthesia. They kept asking if we were nauseous and we were both ok. Husband is icing his injury, says it&#39;s not bad. I feel overall fine - kind of the same as yesterday - I just feel like my ovaries are swollen and uncomfortable. It&#39;s a bit worse when walking, but when sitting down, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve had period cramps that were way worse. I had a teeny bit of spotting. </p>

<p>My one thing I would do next time - bring a book, and some earplugs to block out the damn heart monitor so I could sleep! The worse part of it all was just the waiting around....</p>

<p>Oh, and when I got there, the nurse told me to take my wedding rings off. No can do, especially with IVF bloat. She made it sound like it was going to be a big deal and now my finger is sore and swollen from trying to get them off. In the end, the surgeon didn&#39;t care about that at all. My advice - if your rings are at all tight, remove them before even starting the IVF cycle. Wish I had!</p>

295,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I had my first IUI yesterday. The procedure itself was pretty painless, but gearing up for it was not. I started to see my Wondfo OPKs darken on Friday, so I thought I would surge on Saturday. This is now the 3rd month in a row where I see a surge with Wondfos but never end up seeing a peak with my ClearBlue digital OPKs. Frustrating.

On Friday, I posted a pic to /r/tfablineporn and several users confirmed what I was thinking - it wasn’t a full on surge yet. Made sure hubs and I had “us time” that day since the next day would likely be the surge, which we intended to skip to make sure he had a good sample on the day of IUI. I went out that night and saw Deadpool and had a good time with my husband and another couple we’re friends with.

On Saturday morning, I woke up and immediately knew I was slowly heading into an emotional downward spiral. I used 4 Wondfos throughout the day and never got a true surge, but I watched it darken and then start to lighten up again by that evening. I called the nurse and asked what to do. She said to go get a ClearBlue from the pharmacy, but I already knew I didn’t see a peak on mine that morning (I somehow failed to mention this to her). Looking at it with the naked eye, I can see that the LH line is there, it’s just not very dark. Spent the whole day in bed wallowing in sadness and watching UnReal. Husband tried to get me to get out of bed and go on some errands with him. Nope.

Woke up to my thermometer on Sunday and temp was a little higher than the previous two days. Used an OPK with SMU and it was faint again. I knew the day before had been my surge. I immediately called the nurse and asked if we could come in for an IUI. The donation drop off should have been at 7:30. I told her we could be there by 8:15. Woke up my husband and made him do his thing (and he surprisingly did without a lot of fuss considering I was waking him up at 7:45 with this news). I ran it down to the lab and came home.

I went back to the clinic at 11:15 with husband in tow. The IUI was pretty boring - a little of the same cramping I felt when I got my HSG mostly just from a tube being inserted into my cervix. Husband managed to not make crass jokes to the RE, and yet, he was still surprised when I undressed from the waist down before beginning… Like how does he assume this was supposed to happen?! I asked for a form for CD21 bloodwork so we can check my progesterone - one test I haven’t done yet. I also got a form for beta.

Once we left, I felt the weight lifted. Knowing now how much of a mess I was on Saturday, I am definitely asking for a trigger shot. I’m beyond frustrated with my OPKs still never showing a full on surge. I’ve tried everything my RE has said - try to drink less water, make sure to wait 4 hours between going to the bathroom (seriously torture for me as I pee *a lot*). Try in the evening. Try in the morning. Try try try. Like just give me a fucking trigger shot so I don’t have to deal with all this insanity.


Lastly, this was my husband’s second SA. Here’s a comparison.

**First SA from August natural values:**

Concentration - 23.5 million/mL

Total Count - 103.4 million

Motility - 49%

Total Motile Sperm - 50.67 (no # after - I assume million)

Morphology - 0.5%

**Post Wash Values:**

Concentration - 83.5 million/mL

Total Count - 41.75 million

Motility - 32.87%

Total Motile Sperm - 13.72 million

Morphology - 1%


**Yesterday:**

Concentration - 8 million/mL

Total Count - 26.4 million

Motility - 62%

Total Motile Sperm - 16.4 million

Total Motile Normal: .82 million

Morphology - 5%

Progression: 2-3

**Post Wash Values:**

Concentration - 38 million/mL

Total Count - 19.4 million

Motility - 66%

Total Motile Sperm - 12.8 million (*this value is underlined by my RE*)

Total Motile Normal: .64 million

Morphology - 5%

Progression: 3

I’m a little hesitant about these values. I’m very happy to see his motility and morphology have both improved. But are they improved only because his concentration and count are way less?? The RE was like “these numbers are good! let’s do this!” but looking at them today I’m like ehh???

TL;DR - must do trigger for the next IUI as a I basically had a meltdown waiting on my surge. Husband’s SA numbers are simultaneously better and worse?!
