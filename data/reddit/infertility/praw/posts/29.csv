They are going to freeze tomorrow on day 3 ( which is technically the 4th day after retrieval so I don't get that). Then if we do PGS the next cycle, they'll add these two in there so we don't pay for it twice. That's if they even make it to fucking freeze.

I'm stopping drugs and will start a new IVF cycle again with my next period. 

I still don't know why they are pushing day 3 over day 5 PGS. I also don't know why this clinic counts ER day as day 0, when the other counted it as day 1. I need to call the RE about that. 

He said it was basically bad luck this time. 

This fucking sucks and I want to just curl up and cry. 

***edit- I got some clarification that the PGS they are doing is CGH, not the old FISH testing. So all chromosomes can be checked even though it's day 3 testing. The issue with day 3 testing can be that some abnormals might have self corrected if left till day 5. 

But at this point I guess the risk of losing a good embryo is not as bad as the risk of miscarriage hell again. And it doesn't seem like day 5 PGS is a likely option for me.
Day 3 was chosen because of the attrition I've had getting to day 5 freeze before. Apparently day 3's can freeze and thaw just as well, if not better. 

The plan is to biopsy next IVF's embryos on day 3 as well as thawing/biopsying the ones from this cycle (if any make it) and doing PGS on the whole batch at once. The results take 48 hours which means the embryos will grow to day 5 while we wait for results. Then we can transfer some normals on day 5 and freeze any left. 

If my numbers are crap next cycle, I might do an additional one to add to the batch for biopsy. 
Oh, and 2016 can kiss my ass.

Up front disclaimer that I'm probably over analyzing the shit out of this.

Husband agreed months ago that this month is the last unassisted attempt at procreating. Our next step is IVF because of my shitty tubes. I have the BC and Metformin filled and ready to go. I got a positive OPK this morning, so if everything stays consistent, CD1 will be the 28th. This means starting suppression on the 29th or 30th.

They want me to do 3 weeks of suppression and then baseline US immediately after and start stims. I'm assuming based on what I read on here though that I need to wait for CD 1 to show up after stopping BC, which for me is 2.5 days later (assuming it stays the same as it was for the 9 years I was on it previously). This puts us at Oct. 19/20th baseline US and stims starting Oct. 22nd/23rd (assuming I have to wait for a period).

Problem is that I have a work trip planned for Oct 31st-Nov 7th. So that would only be 7-11 days of stims before travel. Which is about when I understand you start doing every other day twat wanding. So here's what I see are my options (listed in order of preference):

1. Ask my RE if I could suppress for 2 weeks instead of 3 so I can get in egg retrieval before I leave. However, if I'm a slow responder, could still be an issue. (We are doing a FET later because of high risk of OHSS)

2. Tell my work to find someone else to go on the trip and proceed with IVF as planned. (I haven't booked airfare yet, but they are pushing me to do that ASAP).

3. Skip this cycle and try IVF again the following month.

I really want to go on this work trip because I have been looking forward to it for a long time, but I've also been looking forward to starting IVF for even longer. I know in the scheme of things that waiting a month for egg retrieval isn't the end of the world, but we set a limit on unassisted cycles for my own sanity and I'm terrified this will be the story every month and I don't want to live like that (limbo) for any longer than I have to.

So, what would you do if it were you?

These are our lowest numbers yet. We previously had 13 and then 10 fertilize and nothing ever made it to freeze, so I guess this isn't looking good. 

The plan for this round was to do PGS on day 3 and transfer on day 5. Weirdly, this clinic counts retrieval day as day 0, so it's actually day 4 PGS and day 6 transfer. 
 
We paid extra to do PGS that checks all chromosomes, so this is complete testing even though it's early. But there is always a risk that good embryos might get damaged from the actual testing.

Now I'm not sure if I should tell them to just let them grow to day 5 and test then (if we have anything) and freeze all so I can jump back into another fresh cycle. Or to continue with our plan as is and see. I mean, the reality is having just 5 on the day after retrieval doesn't bode well for many making it to blast.  And in reality prob half of those are normal, if we're lucky, so if we transferred I'd still prob have nothing left to freeze.


What do you guys think? I was all ready for a transfer so it's hard to think it might not happen but I want to be smart. The other thing is since we have fewer, the quality might be better. I feel like I need to come up with a plan for worst case scenario.

Recently diagnosed with PCOS and blocked fallopian tubes so IVF is how I was told to proceed. Started my first IVF round with stimulation starting in September. Had my egg retrieval yesterday. Before September, I have not discussed my infertility with anyone but the daily injections (3!) and the reality and fear of finally doing IVF made me feel isolated and the need to talk about it. I also moved to a new city recently and so left a lot of my good friends behind. I bravely opened up to my closest friend here and asked her to not to share with anyone else. (We work at a very friendly but noisy workplace together). She turned around and told my boss! My boss called me today to tell me that he knows about having my egg retrieval yesterday and that's why I am so sore and need to be off my feet today. I cannot believe that I would need to clarify with her how inappropriate this is! WHY?? I'm nervous enough about whether or not the transfer will work and I am not healing as fast as I thought I would from the retrieval (am still so sore and prone to waves of nausea from too much walking) and adding her betrayal of confidence on top of everything has left me feeling hurt and unable to sleep. I guess I just wanted someone to understand what I was going through as I was left feeling exposed. (My boss went on to tell everyone at work that I had a mysterious ""procedure"" so I was inundated  with questions from everyone else at work today and they all know now too. What's worse, I work in the medical field so these people should know better than to share my private health information!) So, in act of bravery, I went ahead and shared on Facebook an article, 'How Not to Be a Dick to Your Infertile Friend' (http://www.xojane.com/issues/how-not-to-be-a-dick-to-your-infertile-friend). While I don't like feeling like I can't talk about it (all the stigma, embarrassment, perceived pity, etc.) and it feels a little relieving to just go ahead and admit it and out myself to the world - but I also feel like I should be able to control who and when I talk about it.  Sorry, just needed to vent. 

*Edit: Thank you all for letting me have a safe place to share. It really means a lot and relieved quite a bit of stress to just get that off my chest and have other people agree that it was outrageous! I am also adding the text that I added to my Facebook post to put into my words of things that I have experienced, because I thought it might be useful for others. As I mentioned below, outting myself to the world as infertile allowed me to feel at least one iota of control in this situation, especially to know that at least I did it on my terms, and not because someone else blabbed about it without my permission. And I received a lot of lovely support from my friends including those who are also struggling but I had no idea. Big internet hugs to all of you, thank you again. 

*There's so much stigma and isolation in infertility so I wanted to leave this here as a general PSA. I'm sure I've made many of these mistakes myself to my infertile friends due to social ineptness or lack of awareness, and for that, I am sorry.
I have to say though, that the desire to glare at babies is hilariously on point.
I'll add a couple of don'ts: Please don't bitch endlessly about how bad it is for you to be pregnant - I'm happy and excited for you but simply have only so much sympathy to commiserate with you about this before I think about how lucky (and ungrateful) you are. If you think I don't know a thing or two about nausea, vomiting, endless discomfort and pain, worry, sleepless nights, and a body that isn't as one wished it to be then you don't understand what infertility treatment is like. 
This should not have to be clarified but don't betray my confidence when I open up to talk about something that has taken me years to admit to and be able to discuss. It hurts to have something so intimate be so casually gossiped about.

I guess I just wanted someone to understand what I was going through as I was left feeling exposed. (My boss went on to tell everyone at work that I had a mysterious &quot;procedure&quot; so I was inundated  with questions from everyone else at work today and they all know now too. What&#39;s worse, I work in the medical field so these people should know better than to share my private health information!) So, in act of bravery, I went ahead and shared on Facebook an article, &#39;How Not to Be a Dick to Your Infertile Friend&#39; (<a href=""http://www.xojane.com/issues/how-not-to-be-a-dick-to-your-infertile-friend"">http://www.xojane.com/issues/how-not-to-be-a-dick-to-your-infertile-friend</a>). While I don&#39;t like feeling like I can&#39;t talk about it (all the stigma, embarrassment, perceived pity, etc.) and it feels a little relieving to just go ahead and admit it and out myself to the world - but I also feel like I should be able to control who and when I talk about it.  Sorry, just needed to vent. </p>

<p>*Edit: Thank you all for letting me have a safe place to share. It really means a lot and relieved quite a bit of stress to just get that off my chest and have other people agree that it was outrageous! I am also adding the text that I added to my Facebook post to put into my words of things that I have experienced, because I thought it might be useful for others. As I mentioned below, outting myself to the world as infertile allowed me to feel at least one iota of control in this situation, especially to know that at least I did it on my terms, and not because someone else blabbed about it without my permission. And I received a lot of lovely support from my friends including those who are also struggling but I had no idea. Big internet hugs to all of you, thank you again. </p>

<p><em>There&#39;s so much stigma and isolation in infertility so I wanted to leave this here as a general PSA. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve made many of these mistakes myself to my infertile friends due to social ineptness or lack of awareness, and for that, I am sorry.
I have to say though, that the desire to glare at babies is hilariously on point.
I&#39;ll add a couple of don&#39;ts: Please don&#39;t bitch endlessly about how bad it is for you to be pregnant - I&#39;m happy and excited for you but simply have only so much sympathy to commiserate with you about this before I think about how lucky (and ungrateful) you are. If you think I don&#39;t know a thing or two about nausea, vomiting, endless discomfort and pain, worry, sleepless nights, and a body that isn&#39;t as one wished it to be then you don&#39;t understand what infertility treatment is like. 
This should not have to be clarified but don&#39;t betray my confidence when I open up to talk about something that has taken me years to admit to and be able to discuss. It hurts to have something so intimate be so casually gossiped about.
Oh, and do not, by any means, ask me when I&#39;m going to have kids. Or anyone, for that matter. Just don&#39;t.</em></p>

Lots of new names/faces around here of course, but if some of you remember me, I was last seen in these parts a couple months ago when my life was basically falling apart. 

My husband had failed a critical test for his career progression in the Army. We were in the thick of our third move in two years. We were buying a house in a different state. And on top of that, dealing with infertility. It was all too much for me and I logged off not just from this sub but from a lot of my friends and family too, to try to process what was happening.

Now that things have smoothed out a lot in our life, I told myself I needed to log back in and thank all the people who sent me PMs, who told me ""it gets better"", who just *cared* about me in a time when I felt so lost and alone. I will post majority of what we've been up to in the results thread because the point here is to thank everyone for what you all did for me - even if you didn't know it.

So, here I am. THANK YOU. If you sent me a message, THANK YOU. If you responded to one of my posts, THANK YOU. Even if you just read my post and sent a good thought, prayer, vibe, anything my way, THANK YOU. I felt it and it was exactly the balm my soul needed to get through a very hard time.

The doctor did add that if my RE thought I wasn't a good candidate, I would not be enrolled in the study, even if I said yes. My initial reaction was no, but then I said I would think about it.

What's missing? Does anything need to be edited?

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQ0LR2HB8rwHqsk420fW9YLJoNqQN3n0XSnQK-9_ISU/edit?usp=sharing

**When to see an RE**

- Conventional wisdom for male/female couples trying to get pregnant is if you are 35 or younger and have been having well-timed vaginal sex to completion for one year with no pregnancies, it may be time to see a Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE). If you are older than 35, conventional advice is 6 months. 

- Feel free to ignore this recommended timed sex waiting period if you know you and/or your partner has a medical issue that may impact fertility.

- Feel free to ignore this recommended timed sex waiting period if you don’t feel it’s right for you. Most couples who do not need medical intervention and are trying for a pregnancy will achieve a pregnancy within 3 months. If it’s been more than 3 months, it’s perfectly ok to be proactive and get the ball rolling. 

**How to schedule an appointment & some insurance information**
 
- You may begin with an appointment at your primary care doctor/ OBGYN and ask for a referral. Note that OB/GYNs are NOT fertility specialists and have a limit to their expertise in this field. Do not waste valuable time working with your OB/GYN if you suspect you need an RE.

- Insurance coverage for infertility treatment varies widely. In the US, always check your insurance to see what is covered, and whether you need a referral before heading to an RE. Ask your insurance health plan contact detailed questions about what to expect. Examples include:

1. What does the plan cover for infertility diagnosis?
2. What does the plan cover for infertility treatment?
3. Does the plan cover/ offer discounts for medication?
4. Is pre-approval required?
5. Are certain treatments required (example: a certain number of IUIs) before moving onto other treatments?
6. Does the plan require a waiting period of trying before they will cover infertility treatments? 

- You may also want to speak to someone in the RE’s billing department before your appointment to get a costs breakdown.

- RE reviews can be found on FertilityIQ, HealthGrades and Yelp. Clinic success rates can be found at SART.org

**What you can expect at the appointment**

- You’ll likely first meet with RE in their office to review medical history (cycle length, previous pregnancies, any vitamins/supplements you are on), family history, discuss possible next steps and tests, and review any questions.

- Female partner may possibly do some blood work and have a transvaginal ultrasound, depending on the cycle day.

- Male partner may possibly produce a semen sample for semen analysis.

- You may need to call back on Day 1 of your next menstrual cycle (CD1)  to come in on/around Day 3 of your cycle (CD3) for blood work and a transvaginal ultrasound “baseline” to check your ovaries and Antral Follicle Count (AFC) and your uterine lining.

**Common tests/ procedures during initial RE appointment for a female partner. (Note: some of these may have been done at an OB/GYN or primary care doctor prior to your RE appointment. If possible, it can be helpful to have these tests done at OB/GYN or primary care doctor prior to RE appointment so results can be discussed)**

* Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) 
* Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) - usually done on CD3
* Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) and/or sonohysterogram (SHG) and/or saline infusion sonogram (SIS) - usually done between CD5 and CD12
* Estradiol (E2)
* Transvaginal ultrasound to check Antral Follicle Count (AFC), check for presence of cysts, and check uterine lining – usually done around CD3

**Additional possible tests during initial RE appointment for female partner** 

* Leutenizing hormone (LH) - usually done around CD14
* Blood type
* Testosterone (if PCOS is suspected)
* 17-Hydroxt Progesterone (if PCOS is suspected)
* Fasting glucose (if PCOS is suspected)
* 2 hour Glucose (after fasting) (if PCOS is suspected)
* Blood pressure
* Endometrial biopsy (though no longer recommended, some doctors do this as part of their initial workup)
* Thyroid
* Prolactin
* Vitamin D level
* Progesterone level – usually done on CD21 to see if ovulation occurred 
* Saline infusion sonogram (SIS) – usually done between CD5 and CD12
* Karyotype testing
* Fragile X testing/ other chromosomal testing
* Measles vaccine titers (to see if you need a MMR booster)
* Rubella
* Endometrial biopsy for endometrial receptivity assay (if you have implantation failure)
* Hepatits B 
* Hepatits C 
* HIV 
* Syphilis 
* Gonorrhea

Medical

* Do we need additional genetic testing to see if I/partner are carriers for recessive genetic diseases?

* When can we expect medical intervention to start? (Time varies from first appointment with your RE to medical intervention.)

* What, specifically, are our next steps? (Ex: more tests; timed intercourse with injectables; timed intercourse with Clomid/ Femara; IUI; IVF)

* Do we have a diagnosis at this time (ex: Polycystic ovaries [PCOS], diminished ovarian reserve [DOR], premature ovarian failure [POF], male factor infertility [MFI], etc) or are we unexplained?

* Do we need to get any vaccines/ boosters/course of antibiotics before beginning treatment?

* If you need surgery (ex. polyp removal, tubal ligation/removal), is that done at this practice or are you referred elsewhere?

* Should we be on any supplements? 

* Should we make any lifestyle changes?

* What do you think my/ our odds are with __ treatment?

* How many rounds of timed intercourse would you recommend for us before moving onto IUI? How many rounds of IUI would you recommend before moving onto IVF?

<p>What&#39;s missing? Does anything need to be edited?</p>

<p><strong>When to see an RE</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Conventional wisdom for male/female couples trying to get pregnant is if you are 35 or younger and have been having well-timed vaginal sex to completion for one year with no pregnancies, it may be time to see a Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE). If you are older than 35, conventional advice is 6 months. </p></li>
<li><p>Feel free to ignore this recommended timed sex waiting period if you know you and/or your partner has a medical issue that may impact fertility.</p></li>
<li><p>Feel free to ignore this recommended timed sex waiting period if you don’t feel it’s right for you. Most couples who do not need medical intervention and are trying for a pregnancy will achieve a pregnancy within 3 months. If it’s been more than 3 months, it’s perfectly ok to be proactive and get the ball rolling. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to schedule an appointment &amp; some insurance information</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You may begin with an appointment at your primary care doctor/ OBGYN and ask for a referral. Note that OB/GYNs are NOT fertility specialists and have a limit to their expertise in this field. Do not waste valuable time working with your OB/GYN if you suspect you need an RE.</p></li>
<li><p>Insurance coverage for infertility treatment varies widely. In the US, always check your insurance to see what is covered, and whether you need a referral before heading to an RE. Ask your insurance health plan contact detailed questions about what to expect. Examples include:</p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>What does the plan cover for infertility diagnosis?</li>
<li>What does the plan cover for infertility treatment?</li>
<li>Does the plan cover/ offer discounts for medication?</li>
<li>Is pre-approval required?</li>
<li>Are certain treatments required (example: a certain number of IUIs) before moving onto other treatments?</li>
<li>Does the plan require a waiting period of trying before they will cover infertility treatments? </li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>You may also want to speak to someone in the RE’s billing department before your appointment to get a costs breakdown.</p></li>
<li><p>RE reviews can be found on FertilityIQ, HealthGrades and Yelp. Clinic success rates can be found at SART.org</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What you can expect at the appointment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You’ll likely first meet with RE in their office to review medical history (cycle length, previous pregnancies, any vitamins/supplements you are on), family history, discuss possible next steps and tests, and review any questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Female partner may possibly do some blood work and have a transvaginal ultrasound, depending on the cycle day.</p></li>
<li><p>Male partner may possibly produce a semen sample for semen analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>You may need to call back on Day 1 of your next menstrual cycle (CD1)  to come in on/around Day 3 of your cycle (CD3) for blood work and a transvaginal ultrasound “baseline” to check your ovaries and Antral Follicle Count (AFC) and your uterine lining.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common tests/ procedures during initial RE appointment for a female partner. (Note: some of these may have been done at an OB/GYN or primary care doctor prior to your RE appointment. If possible, it can be helpful to have these tests done at OB/GYN or primary care doctor prior to RE appointment so results can be discussed)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) </li>
<li>Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) - usually done on CD3</li>
<li>Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) and/or sonohysterogram (SHG) and/or saline infusion sonogram (SIS) - usually done between CD5 and CD12</li>
<li>Estradiol (E2)</li>
<li>Transvaginal ultrasound to check Antral Follicle Count (AFC), check for presence of cysts, and check uterine lining – usually done around CD3</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additional possible tests during initial RE appointment for female partner</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Leutenizing hormone (LH) - usually done around CD14</li>
<li>Blood type</li>
<li>Testosterone (if PCOS is suspected)</li>
<li>17-Hydroxt Progesterone (if PCOS is suspected)</li>
<li>Fasting glucose (if PCOS is suspected)</li>
<li>2 hour Glucose (after fasting) (if PCOS is suspected)</li>
<li>Blood pressure</li>
<li>Endometrial biopsy (though no longer recommended, some doctors do this as part of their initial workup)</li>
<li>Thyroid</li>
<li>Prolactin</li>
<li>Vitamin D level</li>
<li>Progesterone level – usually done on CD21 to see if ovulation occurred </li>
<li>Saline infusion sonogram (SIS) – usually done between CD5 and CD12</li>
<li>Karyotype testing</li>
<li>Fragile X testing/ other chromosomal testing</li>
<li>Measles vaccine titers (to see if you need a MMR booster)</li>
<li>Rubella</li>
<li>Endometrial biopsy for endometrial receptivity assay (if you have implantation failure)</li>
<li>Hepatits B </li>
<li>Hepatits C </li>
<li>HIV </li>
<li>Syphilis </li>
<li>Gonorrhea </li>

What's nice is that this is the last egg retrieval and embryo hunger games I will ever have to go through. We are banking embryos, and I desperately need a break from all of this.

Don't get me wrong, I still feel that sense of 'holy shit this is so unfair' especially when my besties niece who is on welfare is pregnant with her 5th, but I no longer ask why are my eggs shitty? Why do we always have such poor maturity rates? Why do we have shitty fert rates? It just is. 

And I know the fert rates this time were good, that shocked me. In previous cycles, though my husband has 'super sperm', we never got much higher than a 50% fert rate even with ICSI. 

All my doctor can do is shrug and tells me my eggs are 'leaky.' All of my tests are normal. I'm 32. I produce a lot of eggs, but they are all shitty. The last 2 cycles we added HGH to the protocol and I do think it helps. I know there has been some discussion about that here lately.

I thought I'd finally say hello since I've been enjoying this sub for a few months and comment every now and then. This is why I get to be here:

My husband and I got married in '09 and went off BCP in '11 when we were both 26. We were done with school, had good jobs, and bought a 4 bedroom house about 15 minutes from each of our parents (you know, for babysitting convenience). December will mark 5 fruitless years of trying.

After about 8 months I knew something must be going on because I'd ovulate, have appropriate amounts of sex at the appropriate times, and yet nothing. All hormones and blood levels normal. Both tubes open. Regular, ovulatory cycles. My ovaries have a polycystic appearance, but no other criteria for PCOS. SA always in the normal ranges. We feel healthy, we look healthy... I've had a couple red-herring diagnoses through the years (i.e. I test positive for some antibodies that have necessitated getting cleared by a rheumatologist a couple times), but long story short I now know I have endo (1 lap), recurring uterine polyps (removed during 3 hysteroscopies), and a surprise fibroid on my last hysteroscopy. 
We've done 4 failed IUIs. I've tried acupuncture. A year ago we did our first IVF, 13 eggs retrieved > 6 fert > 3 blasts+1 morula. We did a fresh transfer of 1 blast followed by a FET with the other 2 blasts. Both failed. The morula is still on ice. That was Oct-Dec last year. My RE at the time thought maybe we had egg and/or sperm quality issues, but didn't have much to offer in terms of other alternatives. So in February of this year I changed REs based pretty much off of SART data for success in my demographic. I also picked the new RE based on the fact that she's the scientific director of a large center, and after my failures I felt like it was gonna take all the science she could muster to get me knocked up.

So, she made us eat ludicrous amounts of vegetables, I upped my cardio, and we both took supplements. I was on CoQ10 for 4 months and HGH during stims. My husband was on Proxeed Plus for 4 months. We had to wait 3-4 months for this stuff to work its magic. We did ER for IVF2 in June and ended up with 6 high quality hatching blasts and did a freeze all, no PGS. My recurring polyps and surprise fibroids were removed in July, and then I did a mega dose of Lupron to keep my endo in check (in July, in the southern CA desert. Because nothing says ""fun"" like hot-flashes in July!). My FET has been on hold for 3 months so my battered uterus can heal, with a tentative med start of 10/19 and FET late Oct/early Nov.

I am so, so tired of waiting (I know you can relate). However, the more I'm on this sub and get to read the stories of kindred spirits around the world, the more I get to see some really great people
on their quest to parenthood. I feel genuine happiness in the results thread when I see that some of us finally get to live the dream... and genuine sorrow at the failures and losses and the return of people who made it half-way out. 

So that's me. Thanks for sharing your stories and your knowledge and giving me something to root for while I twiddle my thumbs and crank the AC.

I've had a saline infusion sonogram (SIS) in the past and couldn't figure out what the difference between that and the HSC were. I read the description they gave me a million times and googled it but still couldn't figure it out. So, I asked the doctor beforehand. And, of course, I got to experience the difference today.
Here it is: 
A SIS is just like a regular twat-wanding but with added ""fun."" They place a catheter through your cervix and pump saline into it while looking around on the monitor to check your uterus and tubes. 
An HSC is a bit more intense and thorough. First, they numb your cervix... 3 shots right in the cervix. (The doctor made me cough each time he injected but I don't know if that really helped make it better). Then, they place a hysterscope all the way into your uterus and move that sucker around, while pumping saline in with a catheter. Since it's like an actual camera, they display everything on a TV screen. This is supposed to be a better way of checking out the tubes and uterus for any abnormalities. It's extremely uncomfortable! 


I was super nervous going in, to the point of nausea. The SIS was really painful for me so I was dreading this. I tried to watch everything on the screen but it was too painful. I had to close my eyes and focus on breathing. I had warned the doctor that I'd make noises, and I did! He was so great. He walked me through each step and kept reminding me that it would be over soon. 


I've been a mess of emotions for the past week. And being in there today didn't help. I wanted to cry the entire time but held it in. I told the doctor and nurse that I might cry, explaining that it would be more about emotions and hormones rather than pain. He replied, ""That's fine. You've been through a lot."" Perfect response. When it was over, He told me to lay down for 5 minutes before getting up. Apparently, women have passed out from getting up too soon after this procedure. As soon as they left the room, I started crying. It felt so good to just let it out. I cried for a good 5 minutes before trying to get up. I was pretty light-headed and had to wait a little longer while I cried some more. I think the checkout guy felt bad for me. He was incredibly nice as I paid almost $2,000 for today's visit. I cried in the elevator. In the car. When I got home. In the shower. Blaaaaggghhh!!!

I'm glad the worst part is over. Regular ultrasounds, blood draws, PIO, and a transfer is better than the shit I went through today. Hopefully I can get my emotions in check and relax. Infertility is truly shitty. 

Oh yeah, as I was lying there in agony, I happened to notice that the nurse was pregnant. Really??????

A little history:

Husband and I are both 34. Trying to get pregnant since 2011.

2013: Husband dx with varicocele. Embolization to repair.

2014: Chemical pregnancy in April. Miscarriage at 6 weeks in October

2015: Chemical pregnancy in May

2016: Miscarriage at 6 weeks in April. Incomplete miscarriage. Had to have D&C in May. 

Had RPL panel done and it didn't find anything. I am homozygous for MTHFR 1298C but my OB doesn't think that's the issue. Supplementing with folate instead of folic acid and taking daily baby aspirin just in case.

I have to admit that last miscarriage one was the hardest one to deal with. Been seeing a counselor for a few months and that has been helpful. A couple of my close friends have experienced infertility and miscarriages/ectopics but both have gone on to have healthy pregnancies.

We've sort of dipped our toes into fertility drugs. One round of clomid and on second round of femara. Just found out we might have to delay getting pregnant for a few months because of impending surgery.

So, here I am. Posting in an online forum just looking for people like me. As I said, I have friends who have struggled. Even the counselor I've been seeing admitted to a 4 year struggle to have her own child. But everyone that I know that has wanted a child has one. It sucks.

Thanks in advance for your feedback/advice!</p>

I had my followup of blood tests and my doctor said that my AMH (Anti Mullerian Hormone) was 11.6, which is really high and means that my brain is not releasing the appropriate hormone to make me ovulate (FSH?), I have a very large number of cysts on my ovaries that will keep secreting hormones to prevent ovulation (I don't know if I am a candidate for ovarian drilling).

I've dealt with infertility pretty well, so far. I've been very level-headed, kept myself in the right mind, allowed myself moments to be angry, sad, and selfish. But, I always pick myself up and move forward, remembering how happy I am with everything else in life.

Now, here we are, about a month away from our first and only FET (a place we never thought we'd be in) and I'm losing it. I'd like to blame it on the birth control pills but I've taken them before and never had any side effects. (I'm sure most of you can relate to the 10+ years of birth control that we took only to find out we didn't really need them). 

Yesterday, I cried when I saw that the pet store had puppies outside for adoption. I cried at the thought of killing spiders in my garage. Worst of all, I cried outside during my own house party. 

We had a lot of people over to celebrate my husband's graduation from grad school. I was glad for the distraction and excited to be around all of the people I love. Just a handful of them know about the upcoming FET and are so incredibly supportive. I was also looking forward to celebrating something good and being able to give my husband a night to recognize all of his hard work. (We started this infertility journey just as he was starting grad school so he earns extra points for putting up with double the stress). 

A group of my friends started talking about fertility related issues. I was setting up the camera for a group photo and this is what I heard: 

Girl 1: ""Are you ovulating?"" 

Girl 2: ""Yep!"" 

Girl 3: ""I'm late. How soon will I know? When will my boobs get sore?"" 

Girl 4: ""It's different for everyone. How long has it been?"" 

Girl 1: ""I haven't had my period in so long. I don't know what's going on but something is definitely up."" 

Girl 2: ""Are you pregnant??! Get pregnant with me! I don't want to do this alone!"" 

This is when I broke in and said, ""Can we talk about something else please? I don't want to hear about this.""

This is so unusual for me. Usually, I just ignore it, walk away, or change the subject. Every once in a while I give advice because I fucking know a lot about fertility. But, I felt like I was going to scream, cry, and strangle them all. 

Girl 1 immediately said, ""Oh yeah, sure! Sorry!"" But, the rest of them continued talking about sore boobs and being pregnant together. 

A little later, they were asking me if I had been working out cause I looked really great. I was still a little irritated at them for continuing their previous conversation so I replied, ""Nope. You want to know what it is? I'm finally not on any hormones!"" 

Girl 2: ""Oh, I've been on those hormones. It's no fun."" 

Me: ""Oh, really? Which ones?"" 

Girl 2: ""Progesterone."" 

At this point, I wanted to smack her. 3 out of these 4 girls know that we've had a couple of failed IVF cycles but they don't know the current situation. Girl 2 has had some ovulation issues and failed Clomid cycles. So, I'm not sure if she definitely is pregnant now.. or maybe she's finally ovulating so she thinks this is the month it will work? But, she's hopeful and telling me about hormones... after just a few months of trying. WHAT THE HELL CAN SHE POSSIBLY KNOW ABOUT HORMONES!?!??! Clomid and Progesterone for a few months and she's trying to relate to my 8 months of failed IUIs and IVFs when I've been on every hormone known to mankind since February!????? I was shaking with anger. 

We took a few pictures and I left cause I had to get away. I went back upstairs to be around people who weren't obsessively talking about pregnancy. About an hour later, I took my dog out and lost it in the front yard away from everyone. There I was, with beacoups of people who love and support me, having a great time, celebrating positive things, and I was in the front yard crying with the dog. Why?!!??!

I haven't even started the hormones for the FET yet. If I'm already acting like this, what will it be like when I start the Estrace and PIO? I want to cry just typing this out. I don't like who I am right now. I don't know where this person came from. I have no energy to do anything. I just want to sleep and cuddle up with my puppy until the FET gets here.

It’s gotten to the point where I now have an aversion to sex and won’t even let him touch me because he easily becomes aroused. I feel like such a horrible person for this, but I can’t help feeling this way. 

I was diagnosed with PCOS a couple of years ago around the same time when I starting having the pain during sex. I was diagnosed via pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound which showed that both of my ovaries are FILLED with cysts galore. All of my blood work came back normal though, so it hasn’t been affecting my hormones. However, my gyno put me on a new BCP to help regulate my period as I was only getting them every 4-6 months and when I did, they were extremely painful. He told me to use a bunch of lube to help during sex, which I did, but nothing seemed to help that feeling of being ripped apart each time. 

My cysts decide to burst every now and then. I’ve had to miss two days of work so far because of this (my job is super strict about calling out – we’re only allowed 5 call outs for the year). Each time it happens, I go to my gyno and recently during an exam, he said that I might possibly have endometriosis on top of the PCOS. Along with that, he added that I have a tilted uterus which would make it difficult to sustain a pregnancy. However, with that news, he told me that with my combined diagnoses & the tilted uterus, he doesn’t believe I’ll be able to have children of my own. He actually recommended removing my ovaries due to the extensive amount of cysts I have. 

Of course I talked to my boyfriend about all of this and what it means for our future. I prepared myself knowing that he would obviously be upset and this can certainly be a deal breaker. However, he’s totally fine with it. He said that we don’t need to have sex if it causes me pain – he’s fine with cutting it out cold turkey. As for having children, he’s okay with not being able to have our own children. He keeps saying that I’m blowing this out of proportion and that it’s “not a big deal.” But to me it is a big deal. 

I honestly think that he should go find someone else since we’re both young anyway (25). But he’s content with staying together even though our future is looking pretty rocky. I don't want him to suddenly realize down the road what he's gotten into and resent me for it. That's my biggest fear. 

Am I in the wrong here? Should I be okay with him sticking around even though I feel like crap for it?

I feel like this is a time in my life that I have wished more than ever to have unbirthdays and age backwards for a few years...(btw, despite their weird birthday emails, they had some good bundled prices if anyone is looking for a pharmacy).</p>

I haven't had a period since the one they induced 2 months ago to do the Femmeview (saline HSG).

So, the cycle is scheduled...it just not clear if it's going to be NOW now or within a few weeks! Either way it is super exciting! Part of me can't believe that it's so close to happening.

I'm not expecting a whole lot from this, but I am hopeful. The reason I'm not too confident is because they keep finding shit that would make things more difficult. The doc is willing to do a few rounds of IUI with us for insurance/money reasons but thinks our chances are better with IVF.

So i've managed to lurk my way through /r/TryingForABaby, /r/ttcafterloss, /r/stilltrying (like i'm sure most of you have), and /r/infertility is my new reddit home. 
We're 34F and 30M and have been ttc since April 2015, with one MC at 9w. Tumbleweeds since. Lots of false reassurances by doctors and friends ""you've still got time"" ""it's a good sign you can get pregnant"" etc and I wish I never listened to them now. Recently diagnosed with (very) low AMH and now it's panic stations, the clock is ticking at a deafening volume. We had our first appointment with the fertility specialist yesterday and in some ways it was positive as he's such a straight talker and wants us to start immediately with ART, although I must admit i'm struggling to stay hopeful.

So, that's us. I want to say thanks to you all for being here, it has been a big help over the past months to know i'm not alone when I feel so isolated irl. 

One last question, the specialist said there would be no harm in trying CO10Q but couldn't advise on dose (apparently it's not well studied) - does anyone have any recommendations on what would be appropriate?

So, I have way too much time to obsess over IVF right now and it's causing me to have concerns about my clinic and protocol. My husband is not willing to do an out of pocket cycle until we've done our funded one, and it's too late to get on a waiting list for a funded cycle elsewhere because the lists are 1-1.5 years. 

My major concerns about my clinic are: 1) it's not standard practice to do baseline ultrasounds and 2) they don't do monitoring until after 7-8 days of stims which seems really late. If we were paying out of pocket, I think I would go elsewhere because it feels like cutting corners to me. But, this is the only clinic within about 5 hours, unless I went out of province. How you all feel about this? Am I freaking out for no reason?

Here some info about me and the protocol my clinic wants to do:

Age: will be 30 when I cycle AFC: 34 (back in Feb. during my initial work-up) AMH: 41.81 pmol/L (May). At risk for OHSS. Husband: everything good except 1.5% normal morphology so we're doing ICSI.

Protocol: Estrogen patches starting 10 days after LH surge until CD1. Gonal-F 125IU beginning CD2 or 3, add cetrotide after 5 days of stims, ovidrel trigger unless showing signs of OHSS.

I know I'm at risk of OHSS, but I'm worried the dose of Gonal-F is too low. I'd be more comfortable starting that low if the first monitoring appointment was sooner because I'm nervous it will be too late to change anything after 7-8 days of stims. My RE is targeting about 10-12 eggs (the clinic is known to be conservative).

I did one IUI cycle with 50IU of Gonal-F and went in for monitoring after 5 days and had one follicle at 21mm. The target was 2-3, but the doctor thought my lead follicle might have started growing before CD1 which is why she thought estrogen patches should be added. Maybe the dominant follicle issue could have been caught in a baseline ultrasound though and my timing/protocol could have been adjusted so I didn't throw away $1000 on meds to get one damn follicle.

Anyway, I'll probably have an appointment in the next month to discuss the protocol so does anyone have any thoughts? And Toronto folks, do you have any RE recommendations?

The nurse from my doctors office called today to give me my latest CD21 progesterone reading, and I chatted with her about what's next if I don't get pregnant this cycle (this is the 3rd cycle and my period is due in a couple days)


She said after 3 cycles the doctor wants to have me in to talk about the plan and next steps. I don't know what she is going to suggest, but I have questions of my own. Obviously I want to hear her recommendations, but from a financial point of view, I want to ask about weight loss and if she has seen in her experience with PCOS, that will greatly help my fertility.

Several years ago before I was married I got pregnant on accident and had a miscarriage. Going to the hospital for this miscarriage led to the discovery of a large tumor on my right ovary and I had my right ovary and Fallopian tube removed that night (they were concerned it was ectopic). That put me down a long road of multiple surgeries and a PCOS diagnosis, the tumor was borderline malignant.


Now at this time I weighed about 50 pounds less than I do now. I had regular cycles and was obviously ovulating if I got pregnant on accident (I hate myself for it) even though I had no idea about tracking cycles and wasn't at that time.


Since my husband and I are looking at moving out of state within the next year, if my doctor recommends processing to something else, I would really like to try focusing on my weight loss and tracking my cycles with temping, and see if that maybe makes my body naturally ovulate again. Also, my doctor is an OBGYN, and there are no fertility specialists anywhere near us- nearest is a 7 hour drive. Where we are moving, we will have multiple to choose from within an hour away- much easier to deal with. And if losing weight will ""reverse"" my PCOS or at least has a good chance to, I want to focus on that for my overall wellbeing and health too.


What I'm looking for is, if anyone knows anything about weight loss and PCOS and pregnancy, and ALSO, if it were you, what questions would you bring to the appointment? I'm a list maker and need to have my thoughts and questions organized or I sit there and nod the whole time and then have a million questions later on.

So here's my story: I'm 32, my husband is 36, we've been trying for 3 years, and I've never been pregnant. My cycles vary between 30 and 40 days with most cycles in the 32 to 34 days range, using OPKs, I get a positive about 3/4 of the time on day 19 or 20. My periods last 3 days at best. It took us a year and a half to admit we were having problems (we were going with a ""maybe we're just bad at this"" story for awhile). I did 3 months of clomid (unmonitored) with a gyno about a year and a half ago. I did not get a positive on OPKs for 2 of those months. Went to an RE a few months after that, who told me my bloodwork, ultrasound, and sono hsg were all normal - suggested we were unexplained and should proceed to ivf, as it has better odds than iui. She wasn't interested in the fact that I had 7 months of BBT charts that implied I'd only ovulated once in that time. Since I have regular-ish cycles (mostly 32 to 34 days), I must be ovulating every month. 

So, a few months later, we tried a different RE. He looked over my results from the first RE, agreed that I was unexplained, and suggested a hysteroscopy and exploratory laparoscopy. Hysteroscopy was normal, lap revealed stage 1 endometriosis (not surprising, as I've always had horrendous menstrual cramps). He also suggested IVF. We decided to give it 6 months to see if clearing up the endo would help. 

A few months after that (March of this year), I had what my gyno believes was an ovarian cyst explode while on a flight - that was deeply unpleasant, but led to the discovery that I have really high testosterone (75 ng/dl) and really high DHEAs (685mcg/dl). Off to the endocrinologist, who ruled out a tumor and CAH, and tentatively diagnosed me with PCOS on the basis that I have high androgens and somewhat irregular cycles, and no other explanation. We've been trying to get my testosterone down with metformin (1000mg). Since I've had no change to my androgen levels after 3 months of that, she's suggested I increase metformin to 2000mg, and either go back to the RE or go to a reproductive endocrinology research center who may be able to either find a reason for the high androgens or figure out another way to decrease it and trying ovulation induction. 

My questions:
Is it normal that testosterone is not tested in CD3 bloodwork? 
How bad is high testosterone? I have this feeling that after 3 years of nothing that maybe it's an egg quality issue, but the only information I can find online about testosterone and infertility is that low testosterone is a problem. Should I keep trying to find the reason or go back to the doctor who recommended IVF?  Do I try someone new? Is it weird that I've never had day 21 progesterone done to verify ovulation? I've asked for it, but have been dismissed on the basis that having a period means I'm ovulating.

Oh.  Wow.  

I admit that I judge people who get seriously upset at the sex of their baby because I feel so jealous they have a healthy baby at all. I understand a bit of disappointment, but I've had people say they 'sobbed for days' etc. But this feels differently. First, I am not pregnant with a healthy baby. Also, there is very little chance- unless things go really badly- that I am *ever* going to have a daughter. I know for 99% sure that I won't have a biologically related daughter because if these transfers don't work we are moving on to donor eggs or embryos or childfree.

I didn't wear jeans until middle school. My mom still has my favorite dresses to give to my daughter. My sister and I have sister necklaces passed down through the generations, always going to sisters. I have imagined the close mother-daughter relationship I might have with my daughter.

I am also taking HGH (saizen) and Lupron 10 units in the evening. 

I exercised on the treadmill today, nothing too vigorous, just my usual workout. I felt fine. I then got into the shower and felt dizzy and nauseous. I have passed out before, and it felt very similar to how I felt before passing out. I sat on the shower floor for a few minutes. I then felt dizzy again a little bit later as I was making my breakfast.

So basically like my title says, I'm experiencing secondary infertility.  I have an awesome miracle 5 year old, who was conceived without any assistance at a time when we least expected it (had applied and were given the application materials for foster care, had fully grieved not being able to conceive since we had been trying for 2 years).  We've been trying for our second for 2.5 long years, and have gone through many rounds of Clomid through my OB.  I have PCOS, and based on my last blood draw, everything else looks good (ovarian reserve, etc), at age 31.  

We experienced some strange results with Clomid 4 times now, where OPKs do not ever give us a positive, but I get my cycle on day 35 without having to do Provera.  My OB monitored my last cycle, and on CD12, there was a follicle measuring 10mm.  She indicated that it was not going to grow any more and referred us to an RE.  Then she called back after reviewing my day 3 testing and said let's do one more round of Clomid at 150, I'll scan you around day 16, see if it's big enough to trigger, if so then do IUI.

Do follicles grow after day 12?

I&#39;m happy to have found this sub.  It seems like such a supportive environment!  So basically like my title says, I&#39;m experiencing secondary infertility.  I have an awesome miracle 5 year old, who was conceived without any assistance at a time when we least expected it (had applied and were given the application materials for foster care, had fully grieved not being able to conceive since we had been trying for 2 years).  We&#39;ve been trying for our second for 2.5 long years, and have gone through many rounds of Clomid through my OB.  I have PCOS, and based on my last blood draw, everything else looks good (ovarian reserve, etc), at age 31.  </p>

<p>We experienced some strange results with Clomid 4 times now, where OPKs do not ever give us a positive, but I get my cycle on day 35 without having to do Provera.  My OB monitored my last cycle, and on CD12, there was a follicle measuring 10mm.  She indicated that it was not going to grow any more and referred us to an RE.  Then she called back after reviewing my day 3 testing and said let&#39;s do one more round of Clomid at 150, I&#39;ll scan you around day 16, see if it&#39;s big enough to trigger, if so then do IUI.  </p>

 I've been subscribed and reading posts here for over a year (ever since I first talked to my GP about my problems getting pregnant, that was March 2015). I'm going to be doing an IVF/ICSI cycle this month and I'm getting very nervous and struggling emotionally more than ever, so I thought now is a good time to introduce myself before making any real posts (besides occasional comments I've made on others' posts). 

I'm 34, spouse is 35. I've been off BC since   April 2015, when I graduated university. We were in the not trying/not preventing stage for many years, using the rhythm method most of the time. I realized after a few years there's likely a problem with me or him, because this method shouldn't be working this well! but at the same time I wasn't ready to actively try to get pregnant yet. I didn't want that change of lifestyle. It wasn't until I was 31 (so 2013) that I was ready to start actively trying, tracking things, etc. We tried that off and on for 2 years (he's a small business owner and basically a one man show, and I work full time night shift, so getting our schedules synced was difficult at times). 

I've been told we have unexplained infertility. I started with a fertility clinic in October 2015. The clinic is not local to me, it's 1.5 hours away. It just so happened my intro appt was CD3 so I started right away! Cycles have been like this:

Cycle 1: letrozole 2.5 mg cd 3-7, natural ovulation, TI. Had 1 follicle measuring I think 2.4.

Cycle 2: letrozole 2.5 mg cd3-7, ovidrel trigger, IUI. One follicle, 2.6. 

Cycle 3: same as 2. 1 follicle 3.2. 

Cycle 4: letrozole 2.5 mg CD3-7, puregon 50 units cd 7-12 or 13, ovidrel trigger, IUI. 1 follicle 2.8. 

After this I was referred to an actual RE to discuss IVF. While I waited for the appt, I did another cycle. 

Cycle 5: letrozole 2.5 mg cd3-7, puregon 75 units cd 7-12 or 13, no trigger, TI. 1 follicle 3.4. Not a good idea to do TI with that big of a follicle, it was uncomfortable!

I saw the IVF doc. I was placed on the Ontario funding list but told I likely wouldn't get funding until 2017-2018. This doc sent a note to the fertility clinic im with, with some suggestions for further IUIs. 

Cycle 6: puregon 100 units cd 3-10, ovidrel trigger, IUI. ""At least"" 2 follicles but I didn't get final measurements of these and there may have been a third follicle hiding part way behind the biggest one. 


After that we decided to stop all treatment and save up to do a non-funded IVF cycle because I don't want to wait until I'm 36 to do this. Doc is going to do ICSI because he is worried the problem is the egg and sperm don't like each other, and if he does traditional IVF and that's the problem, we will have no embryos at all. We've got almost all the money saved up so we are starting on my next CD3. Protocol is puregon 275 units starting CD3 and then add in orgalutron starting CD7. The clinic where the retrieval and transfer would happen is 2.5 hours away but I'll be monitoring at my normal clinic. 

Getting really nervous, have had a breakdown this past weekend about it. I'm terrified it won't work!! I was handling IUI very well because I knew there was another option of IVF. But after this there's nothing left besides adoption and I don't want to go that route. Same with donor sperm/donor eggs, I don't want to do that, but who knows where my mind will be in a month or so. 

If you read all this, you're a real trooper! Thank you everyone for your posts as well, they have been helping immensely up to this point. I've learned so much and I feel way more prepared for IVF than I would if I wasn't subbed here.

Plus 150 of Luveris for the first 4 or 5 days of stims which was then switched out for Cetrotide for the rest of stimming.

I had decent numbers - 13 retrieved/13 mature and then 15 retrieved/10 mature. 

I never had anything make it to freeze though - first round transferred 3 on day 3, second was 3 on day 5.

I've switched REs, and started round 3 last Friday. This time I have:

Day 1 of stims- 300 of Gonal F/ 75 Menopur

Day 2 - 225 Gonal F / 75 Menopur

Day 3 - 75 Gonal F/ 225 Menopur

Day 4 - 300 Menopur only

Day 5 - 300 Menopur only


Then I go back to the doc Wed for the next steps but it looks like it's straight Menopur from here out with Cetrotide added at some point (according to my meds-to-purchase list). So it won't be Gonal the whole time like before.

Just curious if others have had a similar protocol switch and any results in terms of better/worse embryo quality? 
I'm REALLY hoping to at least get something to freeze this time, because this shit of always having to do a fresh cycle is for the birds.

The plan is to do day 3 PGS and fresh transfer on day 5. Though if I end up with great numbers on day 3, we might wait and do day 5 testing and plan for FET later. The idea is to avoid ending up with nothing because nothing froze. 

On a side note, Menapur does not seem to make me weepy and cry, but I will beat the shit out of you if you look at me wrong.

Since I've started IVF (almost 2 years ago) I feel like I'm a completely different person. I've gained 13 pounds which I can't seem to get rid of no matter how hard I try. My clothes aren't fitting me anymore so I live in yoga pants, and I'm scared I'm going to gain more when I do my next cycle. I hate the way I look. 

 I just think that this whole situation killed my spirit. I don't get upset when other people get pregnant, I don't get offended when someone asks me why I'm not pregnant, I really don't care about any of it anymore. I spend way too much time at my RE's office that it all feels normal to me. Maybe I got passed the point of being angry and upset with my infertility and I'm so jaded now?

I know a huge part of this slump I'm in is a combination of the stupid amount of hormones I'm on and just being depressed and over this whole infertility lifestyle. 

I do have a therapist that I talk to about it and I've been walking my dogs more just to get some air and exercise. So I know I'm on the right track. Not that kind of depressed yet. It just sucks, you know? I hate how this whole infertility game changes who we are and I miss the person I used to be. I miss not having to start my morning with a blood draw and a wand being shoved up my vagina. This whole thing completely dehumanized me. It sucks. 

Does anyone else ever feel the same? Like to the point where you don't even get upset about it anymore because it all feels so normal? And can someone please tell me how to stop getting fatter with every cycle? It fucking sucks. I'm over it. Someone knock me up already. Please.

I was diagnosed with PCOS last December after going a whole year without a period.  My cycles were pretty irregular before so it took extra long for me to get worried about it (and then I was just scared to go to a doctor).  Also, my tsh was a bit high so I'm currently on a small dose of synthroid ""just for while I'm trying to get pregnant."" (but as far as I'm concerned they're going to have to rip that medication out of my cold dead hands).

I was referred to an RE in June when my husband and I started trying (we didn't have to try for a year first, sweet!), and I feel like that's were things got derailed.  The RE sent us to see a Naturopath to see if we could get something going that way, and so that my body won't be ""fighting treatment"" if we decide to do drugs later.  He wanted me to take folate supplements for a few months anyway, so I didn't think there was any harm in trying it.  He also said something that scared my husband into thinking I'm going to have a miscarriage if we try drugs now, and it took forever to calm him down.

So now I'm taking a whole armada of supplements - 3 a day prenatal, vitex, myo-inositol, an extra folate supplement, seaweed for iodine, and (because I thought it made sense) vitamin D and omega-3s.  So far none of it has done a damn thing.

I'm kind of waffling back and forth between thinking that if I can find the right supplement or the right diet I might be able to ovulate on my own, and thinking that nothing is ever going to work and I'm never going to have a baby.  I need to call my RE to go back and tell him to stfu with the natural voodoo and give me some drugs now please - or at least start the infertility work up he probably should have started months ago - but I've been procrastinating it and I probably won't get in to see him before October.

All my lab tests were normal, his S/A was normal, there should have been &quot;no problem&quot; which is what the doc said. I was offered an HSG at the time but avoided the test out of fear and because all the normal lab tests made it seem unnecessary. Now after 3 years and 5 months of not getting pregnant, I finally did the HSG. I had some anxiety but the insertion of the catheter was easy, the blowing up of the balloon caused some brief intense cramping but bearable. Waiting for the radiologist to come in took what felt like forever. And finally, we were ready. I was able to watch the screen just long enough to see the first small amount of dye enter my uterus, and then the pain took over. I couldn&#39;t help but close my eyes and yell &quot;Ow, ow, ow!&quot; for the next few minutes, my husband rushed over to hold my hand, but I couldn&#39;t stop saying ow. I told the doc I wanted it to be over. He said all the dye was in and they were just taking pictures, I had never been so grateful to hear that. And when he said he was taking the catheter out I said okay and then started bawling. I felt terrible and emotional. With tears in my eyes, the doc showed me the pictures and said, look it&#39;s all normal and you never have to do this test again. I think I cried more then over pure relief. So here I am a day later, still emotional and can&#39;t stop wondering why? and what now? It&#39;s such a helpless feeling.  </p>

Thank you to all of you who sent well wishes for my recovery. Reading messages from women who have been through this hell helped give me strength to get through the surgery. It's been a difficult time but I've mostly been coping ok. This week is my first fertile period since and I'm not sure if hormones are making me feel more emotional about it all.

I don't really want to call them ""highlights"" but here's a point form version of what went down:

-My hCG only got to 164 but they saw a mass in my left tube and some blood in my pelvis on the ultrasound at 6w1d.

-My ultrasound and surgery were assisted by a fellow who was probably 6-7 months pregnant

-I went for my ultrasound at 1:30 p.m. and was being brought into the ER at 7 p.m. It all happened super fast. I received compassionate and quick care and was grateful for that and our universal healthcare.

-I was dehydrated that day so it took a dozen attempts to get the IV in. They eventually gave me laughing gas to make the process easier and when it kicked in I thought I was going to OD. The machines sounded like they were beeping “Tainted Love”.

-In surgery they found a 2.5 cm mass in my left tube and removed it along with the tube. My right tube looked fine and they didn't see any endo (something my RE thought I might eventually want to check for via diagnostic lap)

-I had to stay overnight in the maternity ward sharing a room with a snoring pregnant lady on bedrest and did not sleep at all. My husband had to wear a name tag that said maternity and I of course got wheeled out of the ward with no baby.

-I was so bloated after the surgery I looked 4-5 months pregnant for more than a week and it was a painful reminder

-My RE doesn't recommend another IUI because of the prospect of success, cost, and risk for another ectopic

-We're going to casually try on our own (no OPKs) until we get called off the waitlist for a funded IVF cycle. Estimates for this are sometime between November and March, although January seems most likely.

-The surgery led us to coming out of the infertility closet to our families and I have mixed feelings about that.

-In the days after I stumbled across ridiculous personhood stuff online relating to ectopic pregnancies and it makes me angry some people think I should have risked my life when there was no chance of a viable pregnancy.

-The one baby/pregnancy thing I bought during the less than a week period I thought I might have a viable pregnancy was some “belly jelly” for stretch marks. I'm now using it on my surgery scars.

Emotionally I've struggled with thinking about whether I could've had the ectopic diagnosed sooner and saved my tube. I was only six weeks along with a low hCG so surgery seemed extreme. I've also dwelled a lot on why this happened as I had a clear SHG a few months before and no risk factors for an ectopic. The other thing that's been hard is thinking it may have been a viable embryo just in the wrong spot. I'm trying to focus now on the fact that we have good shot at success with IVF and seeing a psychologist as needed.

Side question: how many follicles would be 'normal' to be seen on an US at any given time.

Running AMH test now and based on those decide if even worth a couple of months of IUI with clomid or straight to IVF.
Clomid would be to try and get 1 on each side (i.e. one on the 'right' side), vs trying to stimulate more eggs.

As expected because of being a unicorn: no multi-embryo transfers and no IUI with injectables, which is why the approach of all or nothing for IVF was sold as the best option. He basically confirmed what some nice ladies have been telling me: shouldn't be a problem to get pregnant, but could be to stay pregnant (though he emphasised the premature birth not the late term mis-carriage risk)

IVF we would be talking about the full-deal: IVF+ICSI+CCS right off the bat. He mentioned 70% pregnancy rate using single embryo transfers and the full deal. Seems reasonable to you?

Interestingly enough he said that for 'unexplained' they don't play around with IVF without ICSI or do further testing because in the end, the extra time for testing is not worth it, best to just go ahead with ICSI even though my partner's sperm is on top form. Thoughts?

I guess I'm not too upset because it basically confirmed exactly what my own research had come up with and what I got from reading people's posts on here. But it's 'nice' to get a consistent picture from all sides I guess... Just annoying we had to wait 3 months to get this consultation but now the ball is rolling.

Basically, my older sister (who I didn't meet until I was 17) thinks despite my fertility issues and recent ectopic pregnancy I should still want to spend time with my nieces and nephews and I'm wrong for distancing myself right now. She easily conceived three kids and has no idea what this feels like. In the last 3 years I moved 5 hours away, got married, started TTC, changed careers and had an ectopic. I've been focused on my own life and not doing a long drive every month for some kid-oriented family event. A few months ago she sent me a message berating me for not paying enough attention to her baby and then unfriended me on FB. She was suspicious of our fertility struggles then, but now she knows for sure and according to my other sister, she still thinks my behaviour is wrong. This came up today because my younger sister is coming to visit this weekend and leaving her toddler at home out of sensitivity and my older sister made comments to her that it's wrong I wouldn't want to be around him right now. Our plan is to go to a thermal spa and chill out, pretty sure a three year old cannot do that.

Anyway, I'm furious at her and I don't see how we can ever reconcile our relationship given how insensitive she's been during this horrible time. Also, I would avoid her if I do get pregnant since she doesn't vaccinate her kids (and they hang out with other anti-vaxxers) and I'm not willing risk exposing myself while pregnant or a baby to vaccine preventable illnesses.

Do you think there is any point in writing her a letter explaining my feelings?

Mr. Lemons and I got pregnant but around 10.5 weeks I expelled a bunch grainy black/brown stuff and at an U/S there was no heartbeat.  The doctor gave me the option of miscarrying naturally, scheduling a D&C, or taking medication to induce abortion.  At that time I believed in my body's ability to do what's right and I opted for a natural miscarriage.  A few days later I started bleeding.  I passed clots as big as my hand but I just kept bleeding and laboring for 3 days. I was bleeding a lot.  My midwife asked me to go to the ER. 

This is where it gets intense.  Feel free to skip to the next paragraph.  The ER staff was great.  Unfortunately all of the operating rooms were full so they asked if they could do a vaginal aspiration in the emergency room instead of a full D&C in the OR. The doctor assured me I would be totally unconscious, so I said okay.  They placed the IV and several doctors positioned themselves around my pelvis and an anesthesiologist was controlling the IV. They pushed the propofol, which made my hand feel like it was melting, and the doctors immediately started doing something. But I wasn't unconscious. I started screaming and begging them to stop.  The anesthesiologist pushed more propofol, more hand melting, the doctors started again, more screaming. I was half out of my head, asking Mr. Lemons (who was there, poor man) to tell me a story. The doctors assured him I wouldn't remember any of this. Finally after several rounds, they managed to get me under and I woke up on my side, sobbing.  The nurse who came in to check on me seemed genuinely shocked I remembered any of the procedure. I was discharged. 

I did get a follow up with one of the doctors who preformed the vaginal aspiration and she said what happened to me wasn't supposed to happen and apologized.  It really helped to hear that.

So for weeks/several months after this happened I started having weird flashes. I'd have a flash of thought that there was a sniper with his gun trained on my heart.  Or that a loved one was being burned alive.  Just a quick flash of thought, then gone.  I'd feel like a malevolent spirit was wishing me harm, that perhaps a ghost had taken residence in my home and while it couldn't physically hurt me, the force of his hate radiated. My most common flash was that my dog would burn alive in her cage in a house fire. I stopped ever putting her in her cage even though she would have accidents in the house. I also had some depression but I think it was part trauma and part postpartum depression.  

It took months for me to realize these symptoms were PTSD, which is especially funny because I work in mental health. For some reason I normalized this, using the ghost explanation or wondering if I were psychic. Brains are weird. 

I got therapy.  First talk therapy, which was okay, but then EMDR, which was what really helped.  EMDR is weird but it works.  You first learn relaxation skills, then you revisit the trauma- slowly with the relaxation skills, and then you use eye movements and follow the therapists hand to increase relaxation. It helped my nervous system calm down. 

I am 98% recovered. I still won't put my dog in a cage but those flashes are entirely gone and I can talk about the trauma without melting down.

I'm in the first part of my 4th Clomid + Lovenox + IUI cycle and feeling really meh about everything. It just seems like this is what we have to do before we do IVF. Though, I'm pretty terrified that we're at the brink of IVF territory now. Mostly I'm afraid of PIO. Hearing about the ladies that give themselves the shot gives me hope. I can (and do) inject myself, but PIO just sounds scary and daunting. Assuming this cycle ends as the rest have, we have an appointment with the RE late next month to discuss next steps. On the plus side, I guess that'd mean another month off. 

We took July off from any treatments and it was so refreshing. This is our second cycle back at it. I'm getting less and less optimistic. Early on, it seemed obvious that I'd get pregnant and have a child eventually, even if it took longer than we'd hoped. Now it doesn't feel so certain. 

I think what got me here today is realizing that I need the support again. The Clomid is doing a number on my moods this time around.

Was already ticked because it's not medically necessary and their program is  so strict (probably to protect their success rates).  Anyway, I'm sitting and waiting for anesthesia and the in-house embryo coordinator, who I never met at any of my prior visits, comes in and tells me that during the blood panel they pulled Friday, my Rubella immunity is gone (pretty sure it was there 6 months ago).  So, I didn't even know they were drawing for this, and because of this one small thing, I'm delayed another 4 weeks, because they have to retest me.  So while I was still groggy, husband had to take me to a CVS Minute Clinic to get it done.


But because of this one fucking thing, that could have been handled 3 weeks ago, I've been delayed ANOTHER 4 weeks.  I'm sick of waiting.  I'm sick of working a job I hate, and 4 more weeks of it is pure agony, especially while my husband's career is doing so well. 

I am so angry.  Also, since I have 4 more weeks before this clinic will do anything, my original clinic may come through with embryos in this time (she said 1-3 months wait about 6 weeks ago), and I like that doctor more anyway. So I'm going to nudge them and see if they can come through for me before the other clinic comes back. 


But fuck this shit.  It should have been handled 3 weeks ago on intake if it was so important to them.  To delay me 4 more weeks now over what is essentially their inability to look at my file and take a blood test (they could have done it 3 weeks ago rather than last Friday like they did) and determine what I need. I could be choosing my embryos this week and getting my drug protocol.

UPDATE:  I looked back through my first doctor's (not my other clinic that I'm on the wait list with... a clinic that I left because the doctor sucked) records.  They never ordered the Rubella test but checked it off on their little handwritten sheet.  This could have been avoided in January.

I let it go at the time, but am now sitting here furious/devastated, having been awake since 5am seething about it.

 Yes, I'm fat right now. Since having severe hypothyroid issues start about 5 years ago, it has been a constant struggle. But I work hard to manage it. This time last year I was doing Crossfit daily and in much better shape. And  I have always asked him over and over to do low carb with me, do 5ks with me, etc and no. He's a thin person and has never really been that into any of that stuff because he's never had to.

So this year has just been a clusterfuck. Two back-to-back fresh IVF rounds starting Jan/Feb, then a pregnancy and a miscarriage, plus the associated comfort eating/drinking means I'm at my heaviest. And I had to use BCP recently to start my next IVF which immediately undid the few lbs I have lost. My metabolism just doesn't do well with the fucking hormones and I feel just fucking beat down with this infertility bullshit. 

He gained a bit of a belly too this year(sympathy pregnancy?) and since we both started working out and low carbing the last few weeks, he of course already lost a few kilos. I lost fuck all because I started the Pill at the same time. 

This year my body has failed me on so many levels, and Ive never felt so unattractive before. Yet apparently it seemed to be a good time for him to joke about my weight. I know he wasn't trying to make me feel bad and has no idea how much it bothered me, but I just feel so down :(

I'm not blaming him for my weight problems- just a little sensitivity would be nice. 

I hope these angry tears at least mean my fucking period is coming so I can start MORE hormones!

Thank you all for your support. I ended up going for a long walk, calming myself down and avoiding him when he first woke up. One nap later I was feeling better and when he asked me what was wrong I told him. He said he loved me no matter what and was sorry for his stupid jokes.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zuq1q/were_me_31m_my_wife_27f_dealing_with_male_factor/

But basically, my wife had two children by the ex before we met, and I adopted them when we got married. They're amazing kids, very healthy, bright, and energetic, and I love them as I would my own biological children. But when we got married, we both agreed that we also wanted more children.

After years of failure, discomfort, and heartbreak attempting to have a baby with my poor quality sperm, we are giving up on ICSI and have decided that donor sperm, with my wife's ex being the donor, makes the most sense for our family.

We both think this is the best option, since we know her ex has good genes (vs. taking a chance with an anonymous donor), so that our children will all be full siblings, and so that there's no risk any of our children will ever feel different or left out because of their race (we're white, my wife's ex is black, so our children are biracial).

The ex and his wife are both on board, and my wife is extremely excited and eager to move forward. I'm very happy to see her so happy and excited, and I'm confident that in our case this is the best option for everyone involved.

We will be going through our doctor, and the laws in our state are clear with regard to artificial insemination and married couples when both partners consent and when it's done through a doctor. And yes we will also still be confirming this with a lawyer. So, I'm not concerned about legal issues. 

I'm also very confident in our relationship and trust my wife. But I still feel a bit of pain/loss and envy/jealousy, that I wasn't able to father biological children, even with advanced medical assistance (while the ex effortlessly ""makes good babies""). I feel like less of a man than him. And have some insecurity about what sort of feelings my wife might have toward her ex from carrying more of his biological children. Again, rationally, I know that she loves me and values our marriage. And the ex is also happily married. 

But I would still be curious what the chances are it will strengthen or rekindle any feelings she might have toward her ex? And how might pregnancy hormones affect this?

2. From friends who have too many kids - Are you sure you really want kids!? You can have some of mine! Or you could adopt. It only takes about 3 years and costs $30k. 

3. Have you tried acupuncture (which I have)? My neighbor/cousin/sister/etc got pregnant right after 3 sessions!

4. Just stop all of your fertility treatments - it's not God's/the universe's way. All those drugs are unsafe and not proven to work. 

5. Instead, try this concoction that had ground up deer antlers and dried bone marrow, that'll spruce you right up. 

6. Maybe it's because you should lose 40lbs...

7. Maybe this is God's/the universe's way of saying you wouldn't be good parents/kids would be unhealthy. Would that be really what you want? Wouldn't push this if I were you!

8. From friends who are single and getting older - at least you can try to have kids. I don't even have a partner to procreate with, therefore, my problem trumps yours. Having a child is a privileged lifestyle choice.

I should point out that I am posting this question for a friend who doesn't have a reddit account. So we're based in the UK, and my friend is in a long-term relationship with another woman, and they're intending to have kids via an anonymous sperm donor/sperm bank in the next year or two. She doesn't know anyone else who has gone through this process, since most other gay couples she knows have used a male friend/donor known to them, whereas they would like to use a donor who is a) completely anonymous and b) has no parental rights whatsoever. (I'm pretty sure that 'b' could be covered with a known donor, too, I know.)

They are intending to spend approx. £600 per month (I think?) to get sperm from the sperm bank in Manchester, UK.

Anyway, so I think what she wants to know is: 

1. Generally what has your experience been like?

2. If you are UK based, what was using the sperm bank like? She says there is an interview, but doesn't know much about it. What do they ask you, and does it seem like they are actually quite picky?

3. How do you feel going through the process? How did your partner feel?

4. I guess anything else, advice or comments, that you would like to tell someone else going into the process! She really just wants to hear anything about it that she can I think.

I'll relay all this to her and send her a link to the thread once it's got some comments. I can answer some questions for her but I don't think she'll be appearing herself because she doesn't use the net much. (I know rite.)

I am just so afraid of another loss that I just want to stack the deck as much as i can, but rational brain says stack the deck asuch as makes sense...  and it would be  saturday transfer on a holiday weekend which is pretty much ideal...</p>

<p>Edit:  clarified protocol and type of biopsy.</p>

I have PCOS and at the time hubbys SA was considered ""normal"" although I don't know the exact numbers. After 1.5 years of trying and after tests I was put on clomid and was lucky to concieve my son now 9.

Fast forward to now, we have been trying for 3years, (although not preventing longer) was I needed to lose weight so end of last year I went back to my GYN I was put on clomid again (which turns me into an angry bitch) I did 2 cycles then went back to see her, she said my progesterone levels were fine and sent me away with 3 more months. During this appointment I enquired if I should have my husbands SA done again as it has almost been 10 years. She told me not to worry men's sperm won't decline and sends me off with the clomid. 

Month after month my blood tests were showing I was ovulating yet still nothing. Me and the hubby decided to order our own SA with his GP. Turns out his numbers and motility are both low so month after month I had all these drugs making me feel like shit for nothing.

We are now seeing a RE who has told us we would probably be best to go straight to IVF.. I hope it is ok I posted in this sub, I wasn't sure because I already have a child if this is ok to be here?
