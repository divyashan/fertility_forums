We were referred to a urologist but has anyone had this? I literally didn't even know this was an option for someone that's never had a vasectomy or anything.

So I'll just be ranting there because I don't know if there's a subreddit more adapted.
I'm a 22-y-old girl. One year or so ago, I stopped the pill and I didn't get my periods. Like, nothing. At first, it was awesome, then, it was scary.
I went to see a ton of doctors. I'm living abroad this year, in a country where I didn't speak properly the language at first, so all these appointments alone were quite hard to go to. 
An endocrinologist finally sent me to do an RMI and good blood exams. It resulted in a macroadenoma, a brain tumor the size of a strawberry, more or less. Apparently, it grew silently for years.
It can be treated by medication or surgery, depends on what the future exams I have to do will say. My head hurts, my eyes are not seeing that well and I just always have that weird blood taste in my nose. Sometimes, my body hurt too. 

 However, so far so good, the chances of me to get kids someday are close to zero.
 I've reached out to some friends in my homecountry to get some support via Facebook. 
The answers I got were from ""Wtf do you even care, you don't want kids right now, you don't have your periods, that's awesome"" to ""Oh great it's not cancer that's nothing then !"", to nothing.

I mean,I'm only 22, alone, on the other side of the world with very few friends and I'm infertile, with a brain tumor, and it's nothing ?
Why does no one care ?
Am I overreacting ?

39,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I’m experiencing analysis paralysis and am curious what you guys think. Despite three failed attempts at IVF and now an AMH of 0.11 (down from 0.47 last October), I would really, really like to give it another go with my eggs. I have no expectation of success, but I just don’t feel done, and I’m hoping one last hurrah can get us where we need to be to feel good about proceeding with donor eggs. 

One doctor said she would monitor my AFC and FSH at the beginning of each cycle, and if my AFC is ever >3 and my FSH is ever <12(ish), she’d do an estrogen-primed microdose Lupron cycle. I think this protocol is a logical, evidence-based choice. It has yielded [good results for a fair number of ladies here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6419lu/seeking_priming_insights_esp_from_dor_poor/), and, prior to my revised AMH result, it was what I wanted to try next. But I’m worried my FSH will consistently be too high, and I’ll never actually get to try. 

Another doctor has been monitoring my current unmedicated cycle, just to observe what my body is trying to do on its own. It is a mess. My FSH was 24. My LH had a textbook surge, but my lead follicle stalled out at 13mm, and my estrogen never rose past 35 or so. My FSH was <6 in the fall, and I thought I was still ovulating on my own, so, combined with the tanking AMH, I’m worried by body is going off the rails, fast, and my options are dwindling accordingly. They called Friday, CD14, and suggested two weeks of birth control to reset my cycle, then we’d regroup after baseline and see if another cycle is less wonky. 

This doctor is of the opinion that as long as I have some ovarian function, there are things to keep trying. Her approach to IVF for me would be extended (like 30 days) estrogen priming, then a microdose Lupron protocol where, if my FSH is trending higher than she wants to see it, we “interrupt” the cycle, kind of like this: http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)02002-6/fulltext#sec1.3). 

She was also more savvy about mini-IVF, and suggested I might eventually benefit from a referral to a reproductive immunologist. Basically, her toolkit seems bigger, but her approach is less orthodox. I’m worried about the lack of evidence, but, on the other hand, evidence isn’t on my side, and somebody creative and persistent could be what I need, especially since she will keep working with me regardless of what my body throws at us.

The doctors and clinics are both highly regarded. I know going with one option for now doesn’t preclude pursuing the other later, but since time is of the essence, it feels important to make the right call at this juncture. 

So: should I fill the birth control and gamble on RE2, or skip it and gamble on my body in hopes that I can do the protocol I think I want with RE1?

The paperwork we signed says that if ICSI is performed an extra $1,250 will be billed. I do believe this to be an honest mistake and not malicious but we already paid for everything out of pocket. We even went as far as to import our meds from Israel to save $2,000.

We've done ICSI before (different clinic) and we wanted to try where the sperm naturally chose ""survival of the fittest"" style.

Introduction: Met my fiancee a couple of years ago and knew he was the one. After he moved in we decided we weren't going to prevent because I was getting up there in the years (I'm 37 and he is 34) ...Well during that time nothing was happening. I decided that we were probably going to need help and went to the RE with the pretext that I was going to freeze my eggs. Went through all the tests and all my numbers were good. We went ahead and had a SA done on him and his numbers were good as well. So I went ahead with the IVF and in the end we decided we would freeze embryos (it was a big leap of faith and added to debt I was accruing from this whole process). Everything SEEMS to have gone well and I have six good frozen embryos (not pgs or pgd tested). We then went back to our lives and decided to try naturally for a little longer. Well he finally proposed and we are getting married in less than two months. I went to the RE to follow up and meet my new doctor (my old one left) and start the preparations for the FET. Well my new doctor mentioned that my old one had left a lot notes of polyps that she saw in my uterus (Why the heck didn't they tell me this before???) She suggested I have a Hysteroscopy done and then if there are polyps have them removed. But then she suggested that we try naturally after that for 3 months. We have been trying naturally for about a year with no results. Does this make sense? Or should I demand that she does the FET anyway?

Apparently my family has been arguing about when to tell me, and my self-centered SIL decided she couldn't wait anymore to make her big announcement and it had to happen today.

We have been trying for 5 years.  PCOS and diabetes on my side, plus low motility.  Brother and SIL were literally the first people I opened up to about what we were going through,  and they acted horrified when I wasn't jumping for joy at their """"two forms of birth control idk what happened!"" pregnancy two years ago.   They called me the day before my 30th birthday to announce it and then invited themselves over for the weekend.

Fast forward to today... I've an RE appt in 2 weeks that I am terrified of.  I'm also at cd37 and, while I think I actually ovulated (maybe for the first time) this month, I don't know when it happened for sure, but I've gotten all negative pregnancy tests and been really really emotional about it.  This message came at a really bad time for me.

He says he ""doesn't want this to come between us like last time"". (It only came between us because they got butt-hurt that I didn't go to their gender reveal party.) He said they want to be supportive, but they don't know how and asked what we needed.  How do I answer this question?  

My thoughts on what I actually need:


-Don't be a jerk when I can't come to your parties.  I don't want to cry and get embarrassed and ruin your special moments.


-Don't include me in your damn group texts of ultrasound pictures.


-Don't insist on holding a family gathering in my home and flaunting your ultrasound pictures all over it.  Also don't use that visit to trap me in a shopping trip and buy a freaking crib.  Don't ask my opinions about said crib. (Yes all of this happened.)


-Don't talk to me for 9 months. (I'd seriously be ok with this.)


-Don't come to Christmas, or at least don't act pissy when I don't if you're there.


-Don't act like I've done anything to hurt you or slight you when I can't get excited for you.  You get all the blessings already. You aren't entitled to my joy also.  


-Don't incessantly complain about your morning sickness, unless you want your eyes clawed out.

I get that I'm acting ugly.  I get that I am struggling with this, and their reproductive success is not their fault and I have to get over it.  I have to forgive them even if they've done nothing wrong (by getting pregnant I mean.  The other stuff..eh.). I get that they want the problem of me to go away so they can live their fantasy dream pregnancy.  I also get that they genuinely want us to be successful.  But they don't get that every time this happens I want to drive off an effin cliff, and that doesn't make me especially crazy or selfish.  They will never understand what this feels like.  They don't get that I pray daily to be spared of the pain I feel constantly when I see their son.  That I both love him deeply and can't stand to be around him for very long because it hurts too damn much.  

Ugh, sorry this is so dark and angry.  No one else in my life gets how I feel right now.

<p>-Don&#39;t talk to me for 9 months. (I&#39;d seriously be ok with this.)</p>

<p>-Don&#39;t come to Christmas, or at least don&#39;t act pissy when I don&#39;t if you&#39;re there.</p>

<p>-Don&#39;t act like I&#39;ve done anything to hurt you or slight you when I can&#39;t get excited for you.  You get all the blessings already. You aren&#39;t entitled to my joy also.  </p>

<p>-Don&#39;t incessantly complain about your morning sickness, unless you want your eyes clawed out.</p>

<p>I get that I&#39;m acting ugly.  I get that I am struggling with this, and their reproductive success is not their fault and I have to get over it.  I have to forgive them even if they&#39;ve done nothing wrong (by getting pregnant I mean.  The other stuff..eh.). I get that they want the problem of me to go away so they can live their fantasy dream pregnancy.  I also get that they genuinely want us to be successful.  But they don&#39;t get that every time this happens I want to drive off an effin cliff, and that doesn&#39;t make me especially crazy or selfish.  They will never understand what this feels like.  They don&#39;t get that I pray daily to be spared of the pain I feel constantly when I see their son.  That I both love him deeply and can&#39;t stand to be around him for very long because it hurts too damn much.  </p>

<p>Ugh, sorry this is so dark and angry.  No one else in my life gets how I feel right now.</p>

<p>How do I answer him without destroying things even worse?  Ugh I hate this so much.</p>

so i have stage four endo that gives me huge symptoms but (as of right now) only has so far impacted one of my ovaries - my tubes are clear and uterus looks good. my husband has MFI - his numbers in multiple SAs have been around 2 mil with not great motility. when last we were at the RE, he suggested that we go straight to ICSI because of the combination of our problems but gave us a referral to a urologist just in case there was something physical/hormonal going on with my husband. 

he (finally) got in to see the urologist yesterday and discovered he has grade three varicoceles (multiples on each side) that are almost undoubtedly the cause of some of his poor numbers. he's also a good candidate for a varicocelectomy, but the urologist pointed out that these might improve his numbers (could even double them) but that research isn't conclusive about whether that helps our chances overall. it also would take about six months to see any changes either way from that procedure. 

we (extremely luckily, on my gratitude list every day kind of lucky) have infertility insurance that will cover 2 SMART cycles. normally they recommend two retrieval cycles and then two FET cycles, which will together equal 2 SMART cycles (unless for some miraculous reason we conceive on the first FET). insurance is tied to husband's job, which he would eventually like to leave, and also could go away at any time after 2017 finishes). 

so here is our dilemma:
1) do we move forward with ICSI with his possibly lower grade sperm and forget the varicocelectomy because it might not do anything anyway?

2) do we do the varicocelectomy and wait to see if his numbers get up to IUI range to avoid extra challenges of ICSI? 

3) do we do the varicocelectomy, wait only a few weeks until he's recovered to move forward with ICSI with lower grade sperm (that wouldn't have time to regenerate in the healthier testicles) with the hopes that maybe by the time we're ready for the hypothetical second sewer miracle it could happen without ART?

Today we finally met our Dr at the Fertility Clinic and after revising my whole history, he recommended me to do the PGS testing, but unfortunately they don't do it at their clinic. The closest one would be in Montreal, in another province, 13h of drive away...

Turns out they found an issue. What they're generally looking for is the development of the glands and stroma in the endometrium. Kliman makes an analogy that the endometrium is like a surfer and a wave - the glands are the surfer and the stroma are the wave. If they don't develop in synchrony the surfer misses the wave and causes implantation failure. In my situation, they found glandular developmental arrest. Apparently my glands just took a shit and stopped developing at some point during my FET protocol.

The reason for this isn't perfectly clear, but my RE and Dr. Kliman spent an hour on the phone discussing my case and coming up with their preferred theory of why they think this happened. They believe that the cause may be due to my low BMI. Since estrogen is stored and regulated by adipose tissue, I don't have enough to properly regulate estrogen when it's supplemented during an FET protocol and my body is overwhelmed. This theory is supported by the fact that I always developed a thick lining very early on and then just hung out until they thought my estrogen was high enough before starting progesterone. 

Their proposed solution is to perform another mock cycle where I'm on a reduced level of estrogen supplementation to start off, and instead of relying entirely on blood tests, my RE will more closely monitor my lining on ultrasound. Once my lining thickness peaks and levels off, he thinks I will also benefit from a more gradual ramp up in progesterone than what I was on before (for the record my progesterone blood level was like 47 before my FET and they said there was no such thing as too high progesterone levels). 

RE said we would also start with 10-14 days of BCP and then 2 weeks of daily lupron shots before starting the next mock cycle. When I asked what his reasoning was for two weeks of lupron when I've seen a bunch of people do two months, he said there was no clinical reason for the two-month Depot Lupron that he could see, but that it has helped some patients in the past to do a full reset of their system and it was up to me if I wanted to do the ""shotgun approach"". 

I also brought up the idea of doing an Igenomix ERA in addition to the EFT since we're going back in anyway (thanks to u/giantredwoodforest for validating the ""why not both""? idea). That way I can also get answers about receptivity window, which the EFT doesn't look at. He said we could do that, but his only concern was getting a large enough sample for each biopsy at once. I think it's worth a shot and since I seem to tolerate the biopsy procedure relatively well I don't really mind if he has to dig around. 

So I'm happy we have some answers and a plan, the only question left is which lupron protocol to start with, if anyone has experience or opinions about lupron suppression to reset the endometrium I'm all ears. 

If anyone is interested in reading more about the EFT, [this paper](http://klimanlabs.yale.edu/infertility/eft/EurekaAlert_152159_284_18222.pdf) has a brief summary of the process and what they look for.",t2_13q6et,False,,0,False,I just got a little less unexplained - Uterine Biopsy Results,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_6ogp0v,False,dark,0.87,,public,18,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,18,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1500590922.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Well I spoke to my RE yesterday about the results of my EFT (<a href=""http://klimanlabs.yale.edu/infertility/eft/"">Endometrial Function Test</a>, a modified version of the ERA invented by Yale doctor Harvey Kliman).

When I asked what his reasoning was for two weeks of lupron when I&#39;ve seen a bunch of people do two months, he said there was no clinical reason for the two-month Depot Lupron that he could see, but that it has helped some patients in the past to do a full reset of their system and it was up to me if I wanted to do the &quot;shotgun approach&quot;. </p>

<p>I also brought up the idea of doing an Igenomix ERA in addition to the EFT since we&#39;re going back in anyway (thanks to <a href=""/u/giantredwoodforest"">u/giantredwoodforest</a> for validating the &quot;why not both&quot;? idea). That way I can also get answers about receptivity window, which the EFT doesn&#39;t look at. He said we could do that, but his only concern was getting a large enough sample for each biopsy at once. I think it&#39;s worth a shot and since I seem to tolerate the biopsy procedure relatively well I don&#39;t really mind if he has to dig around. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m happy we have some answers and a plan, the only question left is which lupron protocol to start with, if anyone has experience or opinions about lupron suppression to reset the endometrium I&#39;m all ears. </p>

<p>If anyone is interested in reading more about the EFT, <a href=""http://klimanlabs.yale.edu/infertility/eft/EurekaAlert_152159_284_18222.pdf"">this paper</a> has a brief summary of the process and what they look for.</p>

2 IVF retrieval cycles and 1 FET (3 transfers total). 1 8 week MC, 1 CP, 1 fail. Vasectomy reversal that is slowly turning back into a vasectomy. Last total count was 10,000.

**Test Results:**

Karyotype (both) - normal

RPL panel - normal (I was shocked at how many things they looked at. I have a marker for eventual thyroid issues but it's currently good. TSH = 2.0).

Sperm DNA fragmentation - 31.8%, low fertility (this is shitty)

**Next step plans:**

Lifestyle changes for 3 months - lose weight, significant reduction in alcohol, increase exercise, take all the supplements.

Me - borderline low responder (9 & 8 retrieved, 5 & 2 fertilized respectively). Next protocol will be an agonist microflare with HGH and BCP suppression (I was shocked by the HGH suggestion since it was totally off the table for previous cycles). She said it was very expensive (?).

Him - hormone screen for any imbalances. If all good, TESE/PESA day of retrieval. Early studies show a lower sperm frag % and high blast/fertilization rates in extracted/aspirated sperm from obstructive azoospermia or MFI. I should have pushed harder for this at our last cycle.

Next retrieval cycle - early October.

**Take-aways:**

The frag result finally shocked my SO into realizing this is our last chance with his sperm. He needs to stop drinking as much and take his weight loss seriously. He's up about 30lbs in the last year or so. I also need to lose about 15lbs (down 6lbs so far). I've been pretty firm that if this doesn't work, we are looking at donors. My RE suggested moving to donor IUIs as I'm definitely a candidate but we need to try one more time with all the things. She gave us a 20% chance of pregnancy with this retrieval cycle.

Interesting tidbit - 20% of the clinic's couples are using donor sperm. I was shocked it was that high.

He&#39;s up about 30lbs in the last year or so. I also need to lose about 15lbs (down 6lbs so far). I&#39;ve been pretty firm that if this doesn&#39;t work, we are looking at donors. My RE suggested moving to donor IUIs as I&#39;m definitely a candidate but we need to try one more time with all the things. She gave us a 20% chance of pregnancy with this retrieval cycle.</p>

<p>Interesting tidbit - 20% of the clinic&#39;s couples are using donor sperm. I was shocked it was that high.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong> - those who have taken HGH, what did it cost? Dose? Side effects?</p>

<p>TL:DR - We have a plan! 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼</p>

We graduated last year and have gotten together 3 times since then. They all knew we I had a surgery to remove an ovary during our second to last quarter, and was recovering early in the last quarter. They also knew my husband and I planned to start trying right after I recovered. I missed the last meet up, so the last time I saw the group we had been trying for less than 6 months. 

I just found out from one of the other ladies in our group that one of the ladies is pregnant. I am so happy for her, but of course the news crushed me. I was really looking forward to seeing everyone and now I'm dreading it. I'm sure we will talk about her pregnancy this weekend when we meet up...and I wonder if they will be asking for updates on our situation. I don't want to go into detail..but they are my friends. I would like to think I don't have to put on my work filter and be all fake, ""Someday! We're trying!""

 It's not like this is a baby shower or our lunch has anything to do with her pregnancy, but I'm sure it will be a big topic of conversation. Either that or this is a new, fun version of my social anxiety: infertility edition. Anywho, if I decide to be honest that we're going through infertility, would it be kind of inappropriate, like stealing her thunder? I know she will be very understanding and compassionate (we're all social workers) but stil....I don't resent pregnant women, I just feel silenced around them, like if I share my pain it's somehow crashing on their big ol' pregnant joy party. Anyone dealt with this?

EDIT: Thanks everyone!! I wasn't planning on bringing it up or getting into many details, I just have a feeling it will come up. I think this anxiety comes from a having co-existed in the office with a pregnant co-worker for 9 months. She knew a little about my situation because we chatted a lot, and once when she asked if we planned on having kids I told her we were having difficulties and we had a fertility appointment coming up. On her last day before maternity leave someone had a little cake for her and a few of us in the office were saying good-bye, but it wasn't a big party (we had thrown her a huge baby shower at work earlier in the week). 

As I was heading out of the office she told me good luck at my appointment. She didn't realize I had it the day before her shower and it was bad news. It was one of those social conundrums for me where it would have felt awkward and innaprioriate to say, ""Actually we already had it a few days ago and it didn't go well"" as I'm heading out the door and she's having a mini celebration on her last day of work. So I put my ""work filter"" on and just told her thanks. Me being somewhat honest to her inquiries didn't sour things between us, but it definitely made things awkward at times (at least for me) and that's in part because I didn't completely hide them from the sacred pregnant woman.

My husband (30M) and I (28F) have been trying to have a baby for 2+ years (2 years, 5 months, but who's counting?). Some background on us, we have been best friends since we were teenagers and only became a couple after ten years of friendship. I have always, always, wanted to be a mom. It is all I want. I got degrees and started a career so I could be the best I could be for my children. My husband didn't want kids, and really thought he would never get married. That said, his point of view couldn't be more different now. He says that sometimes he wants babies with me so badly it hurts. Well, that basically sums up what infertility feels like.

I've done the tests, including an HSG. Follicles are good, Fallopian tubes are clear, I have one cyst but it appears to be unchanging and shouldn't affect anything. I've done the asking 'why' and am resigned to hearing 'we don't know'. I have been on medications for Bipolar 2 that I have successfully come off of for the good of my future babies. I remain on one that I need to be on to be healthy, and have a wonderful psychiatric support team. 

Now, after 3 months on Letrozole we are ready to pursue the next step. This is where we are confused. We can do IUI, and have noticed in this sub how effective this can be, or a treatment called 'Effortless IVF'. Effortless IVF is essentially IVF but the egg and sperm are placed in a cell and in the mother for incubation. The cell is removed to see if fertilization has happened, and then the fertilized egg is implanted in the mother. It appears to have the same success rate as IVF and is half the cost. My gut doesn't tell me that one of these is better than the other (but my gut has also told me that I was pregnant many times over the last 2.5 years). I would love to know your thoughts/experiences.

1. I did an investigative ""cycle"". I don't get a period, so I was taking Provera to induce a period. I went to do multiple tests blood tests x 3, Sono and more. When I went for my sono I asked the doctor what I should do next (what the next steps were). She informed me that I should go make an appointment with my doctor. So I did. When I went for my appointment with my doctor she was almost confused why I was there. She didn't have my results and told me that the doctor should have sent me for more monitoring. Monitoring for what?! I still don't know. 
2. Terrible hours for monitoring. Apparently I can only go for cycle monitoring between 7:00am and 10:30am. I live out of town and work where my clinic is. It's a 1hr drive. So the fact that I can't go on my lunch hour is ridiculous. 
3. I have no idea what's going on. I wish I knew what was going on with my treatment. Every time I leave there or call there I am more confused. My first cycle ended with a period (which is weird to me since I don't get a period on my own...). So I call the clinic to tell them and book an appointment for an ultrasound. The first thing the lady asks me is if I'm taking anything this cycle. (me: how the hell am I supposed to know). The doctor gave me Fermera last time but gave no refills, or instructions on what would happen. 

I'm lost. I'm mad. I just want to go in there and yell. Yell all the time. I have no idea what the treatment plan is. I have no idea what I'm doing anymore. Is it just this clinic? Should I go somewhere else? Is everyone this confused with what's going on or is it just me?

We go to a check up next week to see if it's changed our chances (really hopeful ... seeing notable changes.) however, the past week we have both been waiting for my period to start which wouldn't have been a huge deal except that I have never been that late. Because of the whole infertility thing, i obviously haven't been keeping track of my ovulation due to the stress of it all. 

This past month I've actually been virtually stress free but I started exercising nearly every day. I guess this made me ovulate really late (a whole week). I took a test yesterday which was negative and a test today (at my husband's urging after my period started) and of course it was negative. 

I went back to sleep and proceeded to have two dreams about children which were upsetting (I almost woke up balling from one) ... anyway

We end up going to a family birthday party (his family is huge) and there are 3 babies and one child there. It's always stressful and now the babies are getting louder and the cousins and people that are our age give all their attention to the babies. Maybe it's just me, but my husband doesn't seem too phased by it. I start to feel really uncomfortable and almost like an outcast. I don't want to touch any of the babies, I don't want to ""care"" for them, or distract them, or play with them. I just want to be left alone. To clarify, usually, I just feel the urge to keep babies occupied because I know the theory of relativity and time goes by so slowly for them. This time though, I made it my goal not to hold even one of them. 

Halfway through the night I wanted to really cry, but I know part of that is my own hormones for having started my period. I just can't wait to finally go to the doctor again next week to see if the Clomid is going to help our chances. I know that it won't necessarily be THE answer we are looking for, but we will be one step closer to knowing if we can have biological children. 

I wasn't even stressing until I was 3 days late,... then every day after that was more and more stressful. I just feel that... if it's going to happen (my period), just hurry the F up and happen. I'd rather have an answer. Don't drag me on this roller coaster of emotions in a slim chance. (Husband has azoospermia due to childhood cancer - you may have seen me post before.) 

We are optimistic, but it's hard, ... as it is for all of us here. At the worst, we will know in a few months, and at best, we will know next week. At least, if anything, the Clomid is helping my husband in leaps and bounds in many ways.

It's common in the IF world, but uncommon enough in the primary care/gynecology world that unless you know enough to advocate for yourself your doc/PA/NP might not be familiar enough to initiate care unless you ask for it. There are a few things you should know. I'll call it POI for now as that is the medical term du jour.


- POI is strictly defined as cessation of periods before age 40. Prior to this early complete menopause, diagnosis includes estrogen deficiency, elevated FSH, +/- regular periods, low AMH, low antral follicle count. The average age of regular menopause is 51.
- Initial testing should include FSH, LH, estradiol, AMH, TSH/free T4,  and possibly chromosomal testing
- Vaginal dryness and hot flashes are common but not always present as women may have 
intermittent ovarian function for years; other than this physical symptoms are uncommon.
- POI is often caused by the immune system attacking the ovaries, but can also be caused by prior chemotherapy or radiation and genetic mutations. 50% of POI cases do not have a clear cause. It does seem to run in families somewhat.
- POI occurs in approximately 1% of US women, 1/250 women by age 35, and 1/100 women by age 40. It is typically not reversible.




*Great so now we know a little about how the hell we got here. Why does hormone replacement therapy (HRT) treatment for POI beyond reproductive problems matter?*


- Ovaries make estrogen and POI means you are spending more of your life than most women in a low estrogen state. This increases your risk for a few important things: osteoporosis, heart disease, and possibly decreased cognition, possibly increased risk of dementia. Because of this, **hormone replacement therapy is recommended for all women diagnosed with POI.**
- Low estrogen is associated with vaginal atrophy (weakness & shrinking) and dryness. This causes painful intercourse, decreased libido, and irritability. It's also associated with decreased sphincter muscle strength (think peeing when you sneeze) and decrease pelvic floor muscle strength. 
- POI has an autoimmune component and can be associated with autoimmune thyroid disease in 30% of cases, adrenal disease (less than 10% of cases), and dry eye.


*What do you need to know about treatment (while not pursuing IVF)?*

- Treatment typically includes an estrogen patch or daily pill combined with progesterone until age 50. This mimics natural ovarian function more or less. Progesterone can be associated with mood swings and breast tenderness, along with increased appetite (not fun) but has the wonderful key benefit of preventing endometrial cancer.
- HRT does not prevent pregnancy, there's a small chance you could still get pregnant. That would be great...
- Testosterone supplementation is controversial because it also has undesirable side effects (and I'm not sure there's great research on it). It is helpful in increasing libido, improving bone health, and decreasing fatigue. This may come in the form of DHEA or testosterone. 
- Recommended monitoring includes: bone density scan (to monitor for osteoporosis if not on HRT), annual thyroid testing and physical exam.
- Your provider is probably most familiar with HRT being used to treat menopause symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness). This is similar and the dosing is not necessarily different, but there has been a shift away from treating menopause symptoms because prolonged HRT over the age of natural menopause is associated with increased risk for stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer. It's important for a provider to understand they are treating a POI patient for an estrogen deficiency, not just for the symptoms of menopause.

My personal experience has been difficult and I work in medicine. Women are often dismissed and healthcare providers are very overworked, which means if you aren't persistent about your needs they often go unattended. I had zero libido, horrible dryness, and pain with sex for about a year before I was diagnosed. This has completely changed with HRT, now I have natural lubrication, sex is a lot more fun, and my vagina doesn't feel like a thimble. Which is amazing for my already IVF stressed relationship. I also feel emotionally ""more like me"" whatever that means; I'm more emotionally in touch with myself and with others. I have less fatigue and I'm mentally sharper. After failing our IVF cycles, I had to ask my RE for HRT while we took a break. Her suggestion was to ""just use lube"" and I asked again. I am so glad I did, it's been a huge change. 

I made this post to help others because I know how hard it was for me  to ask for the right tests and treatments. I often delete my comments & posts online for privacy but there is a big gap in provider and patient education here and a lot of people who's lives could be helped with treatment.

This is my first time posts here. I'm 29F, PCOS and family history of infertility, husband is 30M, healthy. We've been trying for about 7 months and NTNP for like 5 years. 

Yesterday was my first RE appt and it was INSANELY overwhelming. I was at the clinic for almost 3 hours they drew blood, did an SA, did an ultrasound, came up with a plan and discussed finances with us. I left there with my head spinning, especially after discussing insurance 😑 -on a good note, once I reach my out of pocket max, the IUI will be 100% covered by my insurance 🤗 

Everything still points to PCOS (didn't think that would change). I definitely ovulated and both RE and Nurse were impressed with how well I know my cycles, and agree that I should continue the Myo-inositol. RE thinks I MAY be growing a small fibroid, but nothing to worry about yet.  

We're going to do cd3 blood and an HSG, and then move on to a medicated IUI cycle with Femara and a trigger shot. I was surprised with how aggressive they got. I was expecting to do a few monitored medicated cycles, but I guess the RE was a bit more worried about my pcos and family history of infertility. I'm so nervous about the hormones. I don't respond well to hormones a go bat shit crazy while on them. So this will be an interesting ride.

We also JUST got the SA results back in, which surprised the hell out of me (they move REALLY quick)  See results below: 
Concentration: 55 mil/ml 
Motility: ~40%
Morphology: 0%  

They want him to come back for a secondary SA, but they didn't think we had to worry too much. They said it's not a horrible analysis, but I'm anxious, because everything I read says 0% morphology is really bad.  The clinic isn't too worried about him though, since he has such a high concentration, they think we'll have a better shot.  I'm praying his second analysis comes out ok.

I was entirely overwhelmed by all the information, reassurance and personal stories you shared with me and I took everything each one of you said to heart.

The Good, The Shitty and my overall final thoughts.

**The Good:**
The appointment went really well and the doctor seems like a perfect fit for us. Straight forward, easy to joke with and moves at a fast, but non-pushy pace. We definitely had some awkward-ish moments because our past isn't perfect (Okay, mine isn't perfect. *His* is damn near spotless...) but she didn't bat an eyelash.

It was definitely information overload, but that's how I like it. The more I know, the better! She mapped out what our next steps will be, ordered some blood work and set up an appointment for my husband to have everything on his side done. 

**The Shitty:**
After my blood work came back, I got a message from one of the RNs letting me know that I didn't have a Varicella vaccination (my mom didn't believe in vaccinating and I apparently missed this one trying to get them done as an adult) and that I needed to refrain from trying to conceive for 30 days. I sort of just thought ""oh, well that's shitty"" when I got the message, but that was before I realized we'll have to wait at *least* another 2 months before trying again.

When I went to the different practice 3 years ago, my doctor had me do clomid/bravelle combo cycles. The first time, I had two mature follicles but was unsuccessful after the iui. The second cycle, I had 3 or 4 and was successful.

This year, I began going to a different practice who only has me on follistim injections (they said that doing just injectibles would get me more follicles than the combo cycle would). The first round, I was on the lowest dose and had one follicle. My mid-luteal progesterone was low. Unsuccessful cycle.

Backstory: 32 years old, unexplained infertility. Husband and I tried on our own for 2 years (2012-2014), then had success with our first IUI in August 2014. We have been trying again since October 2016, and had our third IUI of this ""round"" last week. We met with our RE after our second unsuccessful IUI and he recommended IVF as a next step, but our insurance requires 3 IUIs before they'll cover any IVF-related expenses.

I am torn about starting IVF now because I don't deal well with my hormones being screwed with (and am generally a poor responder), the tentative calendar they gave me is a little overwhelming with monitoring every 1-2 days, and since IVF is the last step, what if it doesn't work? Logically, I know IVF is my best option for success, and that waiting is just going to delay the inevitable. If we don't start a cycle this month, we'll likely need to wait until next year due to work schedules.

Need some advice, as I am completely confused. I have midcycle spotting every month. and it is heavy some days, but most days its just annoying spotting. But it occurs every month. My RE determined it to be related to hormonal imbalance as my estrogen doesn't rise as fast as it should. 

So this cycle even I have spotting, so my doc prescribed estrace and progesterone to help with spotting . As next cycle i will be doing IVF so wanted this cycle to be short (else my cycles are very long) . My question is it ok to take estrogen pills and progesterone pills at the same time?

When I went for my US today , it showed I have 23mm follicle on my left side . what will happen to that follicle? as progesterone pill that I am taking , I thought i will not ovulate . or may be I am wrong?

I'm feeling an extreme tightness and severe pain in my abdomen after my IUI four hours ago. It started about two hours ago and has become progressively more intense. I first noticed how bad it was when I stood from my desk to walk to the bathroom (I'm at work). I had an IUI last month, and I didn't experience anything like this, although I had mild bloating and discomfort for several days afterward. I'm trying to get through to a nurse. In the meantime, has anyone ever experienced this?

Update: my nurse eventually called and said my discomfort could be due to seminal fluid irritation or air from the catheter. I'm having trouble walking and have cried several times. My husband picked me up from work, and every bump in the road made the pain more pronounced. It still just feels like really bad gas, but...it's not going anywhere. I'm going to wait it out. Thank you to those who responded in my moment of desperation, especially since my RE's office wasn't being responsive.

Second update: I was screaming in pain, so we were about to go to the emergency room when it subsided a bit, and we decided to wait it out. My husband is a surgeon and his best guess is that  some fluid or air leaked through my Fallopian tubes into my abdomen (the pain was all over my abdomen, not just my uterus).

I've been snooping around here for a while, have found many threads both hysterical (in a very positive way) and productive. I finally have the guts enough to post… not sure if I'm doing this right, but here it goes:

How personal or impersonal is your RE/fertility clinic?  Do you talk to a team that knows you/your case, or is it more triage-like and whoever is available calls you back/sees you for follow ups?

Here’s why I ask…I'm at a major hospital's fertility clinic.  I have a doctor that is ""mine"", but I see that doctor rarely. It’s a rotating circus of doctors and nurses. If I have question, rarely if at all the person calling me back know anything about me.  As a real-time example, Sunday AM, I had an ultrasound, and the doctor (whom I’ve never met before) mid-scan says very curiously, “hmmm. It would appear you had a large cyst…”  No effing shit, sherlock. If you literally read the very last entry of my file before you walked in the room you'd have seen that.  The cyst is why I had the scan scheduled, to see if it was gone/find out where I am in my cycle, talk about when the next IUI can happen (pending blood test results of course), etc.   Then yesterday, a nurse called to tell me they won’t prescribe me provera because Day 1 “should be any day now” – then I said, well my extremely irregular cycles average 75 days, did you know that? She had no idea, and then wrote the RX. Shouldn’t she have read my file? Known that before making any decision about me? I have so many examples of me having to educate and reeducate nurses/doctors about me.

Is this impersonal experience normal? Are fertility clinics all that impersonal or is this just a side effect of being at a giant, teaching hospital?  I'm not expecting to have someone memorize my case - I absolutely get it; they have tons of patients. But, I've had no consistent coverage AT ALL. I’ve seen no less than a dozen doctors in 20 months and lord knows how many nurses (who are not just support, but are giving me direction/making decisions about my care), and none seem to know the totality of my case (one didn't even know I had had the IUI...). I'm working on getting a second opinion/moving elsewhere, but if I just need to suck it up because this is norm, then I won't go through the annoyance of finding a new clinic.  Thoughts?

Last Friday morning I accidentally left out my Microdose Lupron on the kitchen table. (Micro flare protocol)
It's suppose to be refrigerated and it was out for 11 hours before we realized.
Queue-Mass panic attack and calling/emailing the nurse on Friday afternoon. 

Problem one: summer hours and everyone left the RE office at 3pm. Managed to get hold of a nurse on call. She said to be on the safe side we should reorder and get it delivered Sat morning.

Problem two: CVS speciality is s**t. The refill was too soon after the original order, they wanted to charge $500 out of pocket. Luckily, thanks to this sub I used GoodRX and found cheaper options.

Problem three: getting the script sent to the pharmacy. Back on the phone with the on call nurse. She gave us several pharmacies to contact and said she would call in the script via phone once we confirm who had it in stock. Fyi MD Lupron is a compound medication and has an expiration after it is mixed, not everyone stocks it.

Problem four: the only place that was open to take the call  late Friday afternoon was in Brooklyn. Managed to get the meds ordered, drove 1 hour 40mins to pick it up on Sat morning.

Pros: I am thankful for this sub for the info on GoodRX. And also to my husband for staying calm throughout the situation - he did most of the phone calls because I was still at work at the time. 

Cons: I was out of pocket $175, because of a stupid mistake.

I am totally ranting and expressing all of my emotions today, and don't want to hurt/offend/upset anyone. 

I'm not sure what happened. I'm currently stimming for my 15th egg retrieval - and all the rage and anger and bitterness that I worked really hard to avoid has just overcome me today. We've been doing this for 5 years, unexplained infertility, 5 miscarriages. From this whole process, I've gone from:

Being cute/fit>40lbs overweight
Bright and promising career>quitting my job
Social and outgoing>voluntarily isolated and alone
Loving & adoring my husband>despising him when I'm stimming
Being a confident person>being horribly insecure
Being happy go lucky>struggling with depression/therapy

I can't get over how when infertility happens, most of the loss is on the woman's side. Men can drink and do as they please. We have to diet and avoid all carbs and basically yummy things in life in order to increase our chances of conceiving. There are countless shots and scans and waiting at the doctor's office, while my husband just comes in one day to jack off. I also resent my husband because I told him I didn't want to have kids, and he convinced me that he didn't want any either, just to change after we got married. 

I'm just SO SO ANGRY, and even more so now because we have moved on to surrogacy. I'm angry I will never be able to experience pregnancy. I'm angry that I feel ashamed for not being able to carry a baby. I'm angry that people keep telling me to fucking adopt even though they have no idea how much money and time goes into it. I'm angry that people just don't see my struggle as a real problem, but a privileged lifestyle choice. I'm angry that all of the money we've poured into it and moving we did to get the best treatment was all for fucking nothing. I'm angry that my Dad passed this year, and then I miscarried at home.

He was in love with his daughter, which of course made me picture my husband in the same role so I was just kind of thrown off kilter. We were chatting and he casually said, &quot;So, do you have kids?&quot;  Normally I can just breeze right through a cheery &quot;nope, no kids&quot; but I couldn&#39;t pull it off today. </p>

<p>I kind of made a face and he immediately apologized. I was like, no, no, you weren&#39;t rude it&#39;s just that the worst part of this surgery is that it was supposed to happen. But science is waiting for me when I&#39;m recovered. </p>

<p>Sorry to unload on you, random dude.  Keep adoring your daughter. </p>

Since there have been some discussion about secondary infertility, I thought I might want to share a different perspective-- as an actual only child. I should probably xpost this over on secondary infertility, but I just can't spend a single moment over there for my own reasons. That and from what I’ve heard its a pretty quiet sub reddit.

I'm an only child. My parents struggled (for different reasons than my own) to have me. They attempted to keep their troubles a secret because they never wanted me to feel like I wasn't enough for them in their lives. It probably was a great plan. Except, other adults always had a running commentary. Some people just plain outed them by making off the cuff comments about how I would just have to 'fulfill all of their hopes and dreams' or some such nonsense. However, mostly I (a child, mind you) just overheard a ton of various (unfounded) insensitive statements like ‘Only children are X' ... where X can be: Spoiled, used to getting your own way, over sensitive, unable to have good peer relations, etc.. Its actually pretty horrible to find out you were 'ruined' by nothing you personally ever caused to happen. 

As an adult (for the most part) I'm fine. I've talked with many friends who are also only children and I don't think my experience is unusual. Yeah, its scary thinking about being the only one who take care of your aging parents, but I'm certain that there are many people with siblings who feel the same way. If I had the chance, would I have opted for siblings? Depends on which day you ask me.

It's very painful for me to hear people who suffer from secondary infertility talk about the emotional damage they are doing their children by not being able to have just one. I am in no way discounting your own personal pain about feeling that your family is incomplete, but please, don't assume that you are doing harm by only having 1. Many of us only children will gladly tell you that the harm is from feeling like we aren't enough or are ruined by not having siblings. Things written on the internet have a permanence that casually spoken comments do not. If I ever read something that my parents wrote about negative feelings about only having 1 child, I’d be devastated.

Background- I have a Unicornuate Uterus, which basically means a uterus of about half the size, and only one tube attached. Unfortunately I struggled with ovulation and only seemed to ovulate on my non attached side. Our RE suggested we go straight to IVF. We had success on our first round, and since trying for over a year again, we've had a 2 failed FET, one ectopic, one failed IVF, One IVF giving us a day 3 transfer fail, and waiting on our only frozen embryo to try. 

I have a normal/good AMH but am a very poor responder. 

I had thoughts that maybe we can do smaller doses of stim meds, enough to get me one or two follicles on my attached side, then trigger shot and IUI. He's never suggested trying this, and I don't know if it's silly to even try or not. When stimming for our most recent IVF, I had many decent sized follicles on that side, and know I can grow them. 

My other thought is that maybe I can wait to take ovulation meds a bit later in my cycle (I have VERY long cycles, and can reach day 30-50 without any signs of ovulation). I heard this on a forum somewhere as a thought for those who don't seem to have regular cycles. 

He's over cautious about the possibility of multiples, and has been very reluctant to try anything that would give us that chance. 

What would you do?

We have a second opinion consult with a different clinic on July 20th, in which I will ask whether these are options to try. At this point in time, I don't think I'm willing to do another round of IVF, because our retrieval was the most excruciating experience I have had to date.

<p>He&#39;s over cautious about the possibility of multiples, and has been very reluctant to try anything that would give us that chance. </p>

<p>What would you do?</p>

<p>We have a second opinion consult with a different clinic on July 20th, in which I will ask whether these are options to try. At this point in time, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m willing to do another round of IVF, because our retrieval was the most excruciating experience I have had to date. </p>

<p>I know this is a weird flow of my thoughts, I hope it makes sense. </p>

Two days ago I still had a faint positive from my HCG trigger. I planned to test again this morning (CD 28), and was feeling hopeful the line would be darker. I usually cramp terribly right before I start, and I had only had a few minor cramps. Of course, I woke up at 5 am to pee and realized I was bleeding. So cycle 20 became cycle 21. Also, I turned 32 a couple days ago. 

Husband woke up around 7 and I told him. Despite our plans to work around the house today (we're in the middle of a major landscaping overhaul), he told me to stay in bed and we could do whatever I wanted whenever I was ready to get up. I gave myself a few hours to read in bed and feel sad, and then I decided getting out of the house would do me some good. So we go out to lunch and to walk around some shops. Who are we seated next to at lunch? If you guessed a couple with newborn twins, you get a gold star. I didn't realize until we were already seated, or I would have asked for another table. I faced away from them, but the baby coos and baby talk from the new parents was like nails on a chalkboard to me. Then I felt bad for feeling that way, but holy shit was I grateful when they left. 

So now I'm thinking about the next few weeks, wondering if my RE will suggest moving on to IUI, and wondering if it's time for me to suggest it. This was my 4th medicated cycle. The first two were femara only, the third was femara + hcg trigger, and this last cycle was femara, menopur, and trigger.

Two days ago I still had a faint positive from my HCG trigger. I planned to test again this morning (CD 28), and was feeling hopeful the line would be darker. I usually cramp terribly right before I start, and I had only had a few minor cramps. Of course, I woke up at 5 am to pee and realized I was bleeding. So cycle 20 became cycle 21. Also, I turned 32 a couple days ago. </p>

<p>Husband woke up around 7 and I told him. Despite our plans to work around the house today (we&#39;re in the middle of a major landscaping overhaul), he told me to stay in bed and we could do whatever I wanted whenever I was ready to get up. I gave myself a few hours to read in bed and feel sad, and then I decided getting out of the house would do me some good. So we go out to lunch and to walk around some shops. Who are we seated next to at lunch? If you guessed a couple with newborn twins, you get a gold star. I didn&#39;t realize until we were already seated, or I would have asked for another table. I faced away from them, but the baby coos and baby talk from the new parents was like nails on a chalkboard to me. Then I felt bad for feeling that way, but holy shit was I grateful when they left. </p>

<p>So now I&#39;m thinking about the next few weeks, wondering if my RE will suggest moving on to IUI, and wondering if it&#39;s time for me to suggest it. This was my 4th medicated cycle. The first two were femara only, the third was femara + hcg trigger, and this last cycle was femara, menopur, and trigger. I think I&#39;m feeling an increased sense of urgency due to my recent birthday, and I&#39;m interested in hearing how others knew when it was time. I know that no one can decide for me, but I find it helpful to hear others&#39; perspectives and thought processes. Thank you in advance!</p>

He took a complete history and really allowed us to drive the conversation with our concerns/history: 36F dermoid cyst caused left ovary and tube to be removed, FSH 11.2 mIU/ml, E2 50 pg/ml, HSG showed no tube flow, 36M low motility and low count. We knew walking in that IVF was pretty certain, and we weren't disappointed! My AFC was 3! Wonderful! He ordered AMH (my previous Gyn wanted me to wait for whatever the fuck reason) and saline sonogram, and we need to attend their orientation in a couple weeks, then should be good to go, barring results of sonogram. I'm sure there will be something there just because nothing is easy, but if that can get resolved, we may be able to start the process in the next 3 weeks. The faster we have info and a motherfucking plan the better for me.

I am sorting through my feelings and haven't figured out where I stand yet. I am pretty sure that the AFC means IVF will be a nonstarter for us, but maybe I'm overthinking/overreacting.

Found out this week that our second IUI failed. Fuck. Also found out yet another coworker is pregnant, so I've been hitting the beer and coffee pretty hard this week. 

Some background: Husband (33) and I (32) have been TTC for 18 months. We had one chemical almost a year ago, but nothing else since. Met with an RE in January. My tests were fine except for my CD3 FSH, which was 10.6. Husband's SA wasn't great - 14mil count and 2% morphology. HSG showed my tubes were clear. 

I was told to take coq10 to improve my egg quality, so I've been popping those like Skittles. They didn't tell my husband to take anything - in fact, they acted like his numbers were hardly a problem at all - but I put him on a zinc/folic acid regimen. I think the vitamins have helped him a little bit. His post-wash counts were 17mil and 16 mil for the IUIs.

Our RE recommended starting with IUI since we're so young. First cycle was in April. One mature follicle, perfect lining, no success. Second cycle was in June. Three mature follicles, perfect lining again, still no success. We did Femara, Gonal-F and Ovidrel with each, and I responded well even with the doses being super low. 

At this point, I'm not sure I want to do another IUI. I already ovulate on my own and my cycles are extremely predictable, so that hasn't been our problem. The RE told us that with my high-ish FSH, our odds of success would be somewhat lower than the clinic's 20% average. So another month or two of IUIs doesn't seem worth it if I'm only looking at a 10% chance of success each time.

There's also the issue of insurance coverage. I'm very lucky that my insurance does cover a portion of our IF treatments, but the IUIs are already eating into the lifetime maximum. I feel like that's money we could be putting toward IVF.

<p>Our RE recommended starting with IUI since we&#39;re so young. First cycle was in April. One mature follicle, perfect lining, no success. Second cycle was in June. Three mature follicles, perfect lining again, still no success. We did Femara, Gonal-F and Ovidrel with each, and I responded well even with the doses being super low. </p>

<p>At this point, I&#39;m not sure I want to do another IUI. I already ovulate on my own and my cycles are extremely predictable, so that hasn&#39;t been our problem. The RE told us that with my high-ish FSH, our odds of success would be somewhat lower than the clinic&#39;s 20% average. So another month or two of IUIs doesn&#39;t seem worth it if I&#39;m only looking at a 10% chance of success each time.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the issue of insurance coverage. I&#39;m very lucky that my insurance does cover a portion of our IF treatments, but the IUIs are already eating into the lifetime maximum. I feel like that&#39;s money we could be putting toward IVF. </p>

<p>Anybody have any insight on how to proceed from here? Should we go for one or two more IUIs since I respond so well? Or should our RE have even recommended it considering we both have kinda shitty test results?</p>

RELEVANT HISTORY

Before I get down to the nitty gritty of our first RE appointment today, let me give a bit of history. I've commented my story before, but I've never made a standalone post. I (28/F) was medically retired from the Navy in 2014 after developing UC (diagnosed in 2012) and needing a total colectomy in 2013. I have a permanent ileostomy (stoma, poop bag), and I'm *really* happy I had the procedure! I hadn't responded well to any medications which means I was in an active flare for over a year (running to the bathroom up to 20-30 times a day, pooping myself in the car and at work and sometimes even at home, anemic from blood loss, lack of period due to extreme weight loss and heavy steroid doses, etc...the list goes on and on). The relief after waking up from the procedure (ignoring the trapped air and general pain from being opened up and half gutted) was immense! So, anyway, life with the bag is good.

Having said that, I did have complications afterwards. They managed to damage my bladder while in there, and I also developed a large abscess inside my abdominal cavity that ended up needing a drain to be inserted deep inside (through my butt cheek) in order to heal. There was basically a lot of trauma to my pelvic area from both the disease and the colectomy, unfortunately.

My SO (34/M) and I have been trying since 2016 to get pregnant. We experienced one very early loss late last year, but nothing since then. I began having chronic pelvic pain earlier this year that felt sort of like a UTI, so my doctor referred me to a gynecologist and a urologist. Both ordered ultrasounds and CT scans, and this is where my hydrosalpinx was discovered. My regular doctor wanted a more detailed view of the tube, so she ordered an MRI with contrast. Gyno threw in CD3 panel for the fun of it, and she reported that my LH and FSH were ""flipped"" which may indicate PCOS, but she wasn't willing to diagnose me with it just yet. Radiology reports all came back that my right tube is indeed blocked and filled with fluid, and there may be some endometriosis. So, we were referred to an RE ""out in town"" (so far, everything had been taken care of at our local VA hospital). Today was our first time meeting the RE, and what she told us really surprised me.

THE NITTY GRITTY...

I was under the assumption that my tube would need to be dealt with surgically in order to have any chance of success with fertility in the future because of the fluid impeding implantation. However, because of my history of pelvic surgeries and complications, she told us that she wants to leave the hydrosalpinx alone and go straight to IVF (she also suspects that scar tissue may be impeding my left tube from reaching my left ovary in order to pick up anything after ovulation). She mentioned the Essure coil that could be placed inside the tube to block it, but she feels strongly that it would likely cause further complications that would create a need for more pelvic surgery...which is what she feels needs to be avoided at this time.

She ordered a few more tests for me before she makes her final recommendation (saline sonohysterogram, CD5-CD11 ultrasounds), but she sounded so optimistic about our chances even if we leave the tube in place. I have a very high AMH, and SO's SA came back with great results. Despite all of that, I can't shake this feeling that this tube with its fluid is going to screw up our implantation and possibly put me at an increased risk of miscarriages even IF the IVF procedure(s) work(s).

I plan to press her a bit more about her clinic's success with leaving hydros in place and if she plans to aspirate the fluid before transfers and things like that, but I was curious to see if anyone here had any advice or is possibly in a similar situation (trying to conceive with hydrosalpinx/salpinges being left in place). I am kind of dreading going through a cycle with the ups and downs and costs just to have embryos washed out by my messed up anatomy...

All of your failures knocked me down further and all of your hope reminded me of my own hopelessness. It was a selfish place, I realize. The last year and a half have been particularly difficult, but I think I'm finally emerging from that awfully isolated place infertility dragged me to. First of all I wanted to say thank you for all of the kindness I received while here and to say the camaraderie I have with other folks living through this hell has truly been lifesaving. Anyway, I'm here to ask if there is anyone that would want to help me with a personal project I'm doing on infertility. I'm writing a book of sorts on all the different levels of hell infertility takes you, and I would like to interview others willing to share their experience with me. Ideally I would like the interview to be more of a casual conversation about the ways this experience has affected you. Depending on your comfort level and if you are in the PNW or Florida I would love to do it in person. I'll buy you a coffee or dinner or a beer!

Honestly, I'm not sure where I belong. I don't want to intrude on people that have been through so much, but I just don't like the feeling I get from the other subs. I've been in the tfab sub for a while now, as we're at cycle 14.... but there's so much cutesy crap over there that it's starting to just make me so angry. 

Checked out the stilltrying... same feeling. I really don't want to bother anyone but I don't know where to share my frustrations and my sadness that just gets harder month after month. Cycle after cycle. I'm 29, I'll be 30 in October. My husband is 38. (Trigger warning) he has 3 boys from his first marriage, 17 13 and 7.  The ironic part is that our doctor has us pegged at male factor infertility right now. 

I've never had one, I've never even had the hint of a line. No miscarriages that I know of, no chemical no nothing. I've had previous long term monogamous relationships before my husband, with years of unprotected intercourse, nothing. 

So his numbers are right under the low end of normal. If I can beat lifestyle changes into him, and the next urologist we see has anything useful to say (the first one was a useless dolt), I think his problems will be ok. Obviously his junk worked before. But I think then we'll be back for more testing for me. I've had hormone testing and a vitamin D deficiency, waiting for the results after 12 weeks of ergocalciferol. Had an HSG, came back ""normal"". Very detailed explanation from the doctor. 
I have a hard time believing it's all my husband. I've wanted a baby my entire life. I've been tracking my cycles for years. Ovulation predictors for the last 2 years. The first year and a half of our relationship we weren't trying not to, and we hit plenty of cycles then too. Still nothing. I'm just starting to feel hopeless, and stuck and like nothing will ever work. I think it's even harder with male factor because I can't change his diet. I can't make him exercise. I can't do anything. We have been actively trying for the last year, and I know many of you have been at it for much longer and I'm so sorry. I don't want to intrude. I just feel so sad and so alone and don't feel like I belong anywhere. 

My husband has had a semen analysis from his regular doctor, that got him a referral to a urologist. He repeated the analysis one month later and the number were maybe 2 mil higher. Still below normal. Manually checked for varicocele, did some basic bloodwork, testosterone was in range. Most things looked blood wise basically normal, just the semen quantity quality and motility. That urologist decided there was nothing else for him he could do. What a waste of time. We ended up having a joint appointment with my gynecologist nurse lady, as I have a long track record of abnormal paps and colposcopies for ascus/can not rule out high grade. So that's been miserable for the last 3 years. That mess started maybe 4 months before I met my husband. Maybe summer 2013, 2014? I think. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I tried not to break any sub rules... sorry for the triggers I'm sorry for everything I just don't know who to talk to anymore and crying on my dogs is good I guess but they don't know what a colposcopy is or what it feels like to have a catheter in their uterus or why I cry on them every month because all I get is endless cheerfulness from my husband.

Let me start by saying thanks to everyone who bothers to read/assist. I have said this repeatedly, but I know almost nothing about the terminology involved in IF, so I struggle with how to discuss my medical history in any kind of cognizant way. Among other things but maybe the most frustrating, I struggle with significant brain fog as an effect of fibromyalgia. It's extremely exasperating. 

I will try to keep this short and sweet, but you can look back at my post history for details if you'd like. 

I had the worst ObGyn for forever, who did things like not tell me when my STI tests came back positive from a cheating partner or recommend treatment, downplay then suddenly play up potential cancer diagnosis but refuse to give me a referral, and was overall horridly judgey about my attempts at fertility with my ex-husband.

Fast forward to now. I started a new job a couple of months ago, and have new insurance as a result, that covers a big Ole zilch for infertility care of any kind at all. Except... I talked to my Dr last week (an awesome ObGyn) about how my other Dr's want me to start treatment at the end of the year that means I'll not get another chance to reproduce if I don't do something yesterday. She thinks if I start now, I might get a shot at treatment (retrieval and freezing) before I lose the ability for good. 

Here's the catch: my previous sucky Dr's office says they no longer have my medical records available for transfer to my new doc, but if I can ""prove"" recurrent loss, new Dr can get my insurance to cover some bits and pieces of preparation and testing to determine if I'm a candidate for storage until later (if later is ever a thing, GC, etc. I don't know, I haven't thought that far ahead yet.).

The problem for me is that since sucky Dr never really explained anything to me nor did I know what questions to ask, and essentially my only source of education on my body is google, I am trying to piece together a ""formal"" medical history with like nothing to go on but a very foggy memory (hence the question in yesterday's daily).

So, here's my bid for support: would one or two of you be willing to let me pester the crap out of your PM inbox while I sort through this paperwork? I know that stupid noob questions can get a little thick around here, and don't wanna be ""that guy"", but I'm not sure where else to turn. I will absolutely do my homework best I can, but sometimes I don't even know where to start with Google.

 I was told very early on by an endocrinologist not to take Vitex, or chasteberry as they would only increase my high side of normal free testosterone. I dont know how he came up with that information so quickly, he hadnt even heard of vitex before I mentioned it.

I read once that d-chiro-inosital would help with pcos, and its found in chick peas. So I went on a hummus binge for a while, but still didnt ovulate.

Other things I am currently doing, in hopes they are not bogus: 

Daily Cinnamon for insulin resistance. My sugars have always read normal but I had one high insulin test once.. which resulted in my PCOS diagnosis. I make my own pills with the highest quality cinnamon available. 

Daily Apple Cider Vinegar. My mother in law swears this is a ""miracle"" for overall health. And I figure why the hell not try it. 

Daily Meditation. Might not help me ovulate but certainly helps me deal with the emotional roller coaster. 

Any idea if blackberry leaves would work as well a raspberry leaves? We discovered a huge patch of blackberries on the back of our property and wouldnt mind making tea from it.

And what about prenatals? Is there a brand you trust? I generally distrust supplements after reading a study that found all kinds of crazy shit in supplements and not much if none of what was supposed to be in those supplements. 

Of course, we are still waiting for appointments for a gyn (no REs near by). And will be pursuing femara, and other proven treatments. Just curious as to what y'all have tried. 

Edit: I also want to hear about bogus fertility sites. Which ones give the worst advice? I read one comment on the pet peeve thread about at least one site that was totally not legit. If I can find it again I will ask over there.

I know we will have our small human someday, I hope but man has this been hard. So I guess my question is, Am I just being a gigantic ahole and how oh how did I get over this and try to embrace the happy?</p>
