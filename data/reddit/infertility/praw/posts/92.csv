**BACKGROUND:** I have a polyp sitting on the bottom of my uterus (inside the uterine cavity) and I have 2 REs (long story) that I go to.  One would like to remove asap before I start to stim for IVF (he is local does my IUIs) and the other RE (CrossCountry RE) said he would remove the polyp during my egg retrieval 

Local RE said the reason to do it before is that the uterus lining is thinner if you do it Day 6 of cycle and the polyp is easier to remove. He made an analogy of finding and picking up a golf ball in short grass vs long thick grass. 

CrossCountry RE said his preference is bc ""You will already be under and won't have to go under 2x.""

Going under with Twilight anesthesia doesn't really bother me. I just want the polyp completely gone so it doesn't interfere with implantation or cause another MC (bc they think it could have caused my previous MC). I also have some fibroids so I hope they can remove those too. And some cysts on my ovaries - but those apparently can't be removed until I am ready to stop trying to conceive.

Good to have such a supporting community here 🙂..My insurance told me to select the doctors in these 2 groups that is , HRC fertility (   Www.havingbabies.com) and Reproductive partners (Www.reproductivepartners.com) . Please let me know if anyone selected the doctors from these 2 groups and had success. Thank you for the help.

This is my infertility story. My age is 33 and my husband age is 35. We live in Irvine, CA. We are trying to conceive from past 3 to 4 years but no luck.  We started our treatment from the year 2016 and our doctor did all kinds of necessary tests and he told us that, we are suffering from unexplained infertility 😔 

We did couple rounds of clomid ( I did get pregnant in my first clomid cycle but miscarried around 6 weeks no heartbeat ) after that, we did few rounds of famera but no success. Then we decided to do ivf and we did our first round of ivf in 2018. I choose famous nearby doctor in Irvine. Our treatment started and everything went well. At the end we got 2 PGS tested normal embryos. But I had lot of pain in the embryo transfer process. Doctor assured me that, he placed the embryos where there are suppose to place..So, no need to worry. After 10 days my first beta was 6 very very low number. I was devastated and our first cycle was failed. 
Then the next year i.e 2019 we transferred our second PGS normal embryo.Again same thing happened. This time I was bleeding during the embryo transfer process and it was very painful. Again doctor told me it won’t effect to the result..Sometimes there may be some blockages in the uterus ...🙃..So he used different catheter for transfer. Again the results were same and my beta was 7 this time and our second transfer failed.

Now after 1 year I want to do my 2nd round of ivf. Am not much confident to go with my previous doctor and the treatment is very expensive.

I (32F) have been lurking for a couple months and have been feeling like I wanted to introduce myself for a few weeks. Due to COVID-19 and where I was in my cycle, my husband (32M) and I are still pre-diagnosis. We have done a couple of phone consultations with two out of three of our referred infertility specialists and have results from blood/semen tests with our PCPs. However, we haven't had the opportunity to go through the more substantive tests and labs like HSG/a second semen analysis/etc. The results that led to our referral are below:

1. AMH    1.31 ng/mL
2. Progesterone (cycle day 21)    1.6 ng/mL
3. Sperm count    0.7 million/cc
4. Spermatozoa, motile %    8%

We haven't been trying for very long (July 2019) but I felt that things were off for me. My periods are very, very light and I often can't even fill a tampon and don't bleed beyond 1 single day and very lightly spot before and afterwards. I had IUDs (Mirena then Paraguard) in my 20s and had Chlamydia from a cheating ex-boyfriend in my early 20s. Finally, I have been and am continuing to use OPKs and have never seen a strong positive. I am at a healthy weight and have stopped my half-marathon training on advice from our RE.

On my husband's side, his first and only sperm analysis is not very promising and he is technically obese. I say technically only because he could absolutely lose some fat around his middle but is very, very active and has a ton of muscle. He did have a very bad cold a month prior to his SA testing.

I feel like I want to ask you all what we could possibly be diagnosed with but I know it's too early to speculate. From my reading, it seems that unless our SA results improve significantly, we're likely going to skip straight to IVF.

I'd love to read about similar experiences or insight into our initial results. Or if anyone has had experiences with Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine or Conceptions Denver I would love to read about those.

For further testing we have been tasked with: Day 3 Labs (E2, FSH, LH) with AMH, Baseline ultrasound and 3D ultrasound, HSG, midcycle endometrial biopsy to test for CD138 and cultures, blood draws (CBC, TSH, Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody, blood type, Vitamin D, Chem20, Free T4, Antibodies, Rubella, Varicella), semen analysis, semen culture, Anti-sperm antibodies.

Anyways, thank you all for building this community and for the interesting and helpful posts and resources.

I was bored at lunch and a live popped up in my facebook feed and I started watching it. Probably shouldn’t have. But you know how it is sometimes...

It was by a 21yo girl who still studies at highschool, has no job and lives with her parents. She’s been together with her boyfriend for less than 2 months. He is 20yo, has no job either and lives with his parents too. They both look kind of untidy and disheveled.

She says she’s pregnant and shows 3 different pregnancy tests that are barely positive but still more than squinters. Says it was unplanned but that she’s never used any protection for the last couple years. Also been a smoker this whole time and says she stopped yesterday when she got the positive tests.

She is talking in the most monotone voice I’ve ever heard from a human in my life. Her face is completely stiff too.

Says she’s gonna keep it, she’s so happy, her boyfriend too, that their parents are also happy. Says she’s 2+4 weeks. From last period! Says she’s had strong pregnancy symptoms this whole cycle(!). What?

She answers differently to the same questions throughout the whole live.

She gets angry and annoyed when people asks completely normal questions and when someone is trying to give advice, for example telling her to take supplements for folic acid.

Says all the questions is stressing her out and that it’s gonna make her go out and take a smoke if it doesn’t stop.

She asks a lot of stupid questions herself to the chat and you can tell she has NO IDEA ABOUT ANYTHING. And again gets angry when people answer her questions.

She just sits there saying some really nasty and toxic stuff for a long time and expects people to only congratulate her and wish her well wishes.

Somebody is calmly telling her about their own story with their last pregnancy and symptoms and such, but mentions that that pregnancy sadly ended in miscarriage. The story was not specifically about the miscarriage. But some people in the chat and the girl in the live just went completely hysterical and just screamed “DoN’t TaLk AbOuT mIsCaRrIaGe!!1!11!!1!” and pretty much told that poor commenter to fuck off and die.

I was so choked!

She acted like if no one talked about miscarriage it couldn’t and wouldn’t happen.

That made me so sad and angry. That people that have lost a pregnancy don’t seem to have a right to speak because they bring bad luck or something.

I feel so angry and broken now. Am I a failed human because I’ve had a miscarriage? This can’t be fair, right?

Does anybody have any idea what this girls’ problem is and how one should handle people like her?

Edit: I'm not even thinking about myself much anymore. I've pretty much healed from my own MC. But what about all the other girls that haven't or is in the middle of it? I feel so broken for them.

I'm an essential worker in addiction services... I was moved to a site for coverage and decided to stay with someone I knew who lived near that facility since it was closer and my car is not currently in good conditions. While I was sleeping they got a call informing them someone they had been in contact 24 hours ago has been ordered to quarantine by the county due to expose to someone who is COVID+. 

The household I was in was instructed to self quarantine until we know if the the individual who failed to self-quarantine after exposure is - or +.

I'm still being told to go to work even after I disclosed this to my employer.

I'm currently dealing with unexplained amenorrhea. I'm on Metformin to induce my period, and so far this year I've had one period in 2020. In 2019 I had 5 periods, 3 of them were induced. In 2018 I had 4 periods.

I've been not trying/not preventing and sometimes just TTC with my partner for 3 years now. Nothing. And it seems every fucking day I'm reminded of my own body failing me.

My coworker has made jokes of my body being broken. My boyfriend being insensitive and not thinking before speaking, as supportive as he is when I really need him makes up stupid comments about ""maybe your body tries to get pregnant but at the last minute is like 'nah'. I get on reddit or play mobile games and gets those stupid fucking ads from ChoiceGames where ""oh no a positive pregnancy test"". 

I've been blocking the ads for weeks now. It's Bernie Sanders campaign ads all over again. They just keep. Showing. Up.

I had a UTI and was peeing a lot and my coworker asked me if I was pregnant.

I threw up a couple months ago because I was sick and my boss asked me if I was pregnant.

I talk to my mom and she jokes about me being pregnant.

We go to my in-laws and they now are making jokes about grandkids.

I'm so fucking tired, and I'm so fucking angry.

Even when I've disclosed to some of the individuals that I don't get my periods, I don't ovulate and I have a pretty bad case of PCOS- the comments still fucking continue.

And every single god damn plan I had for 2020 that I had to look forward to and distract myself with. What helped me make everything bearable. Gone for now. No more getting a new car, finally going to an endocrinologist, a concert I was hoping to go to.

Because I'm the only income in my household and need to use the savings to make up for my partner being unemployed due to COVID.

It feels like everything I've worked hard for has been ripped away right under me, again, and again and it's so draining.

I'm at the point were I'm okay with not having a baby right now, waiting a couple years. But it's hard that even with weight loss, supplements and medication my body still feels and acts so fucked up. It took me so long to get over that, and being told by my pregnant coworker that I'm just broken just fucking destroyed me. 

Going to work and taking care of individuals who are withdrawing from meth and heroine, destroying their bodies with track marks and seeing them have no issues with fertility fucking destroys me.

I have a college degree, a job with ok insurance. I live on my own. And yet because of everything going on I don't have enough to pay for the labs I need to get done and going to the doctors right now is a financial decision that I have to plan and save for. Because of everything going on- I can't even take a fucking vacation I had planned and saved for since last year.

But deep down I know the problem is I'm just tired of waiting and putting things off because of other people or things I can't control.

I know with time it will happen, and hope most things come easily and fast. But it doesn't.

I'm just tired of waiting. I work hard for the things I have and want, and it feels like my arm gets bent backwards and the fruits of my labor get reaped by someone else. If I hadn't helped, I could have gone to an endocrinologist and gotten a different treatment to even just try for a baby, or at least being ovulating.

But I don't get to. 

Because x family member needed help with debt. 

Their debt was my new car, vacation, or multiple IUI treatments if I come to need it, or even going back to college to get my Bachelors.

It feels like my life is on hold.

Weeks went by and it was everyone's turn to have an ultrasound. Theirs showed healthy flickers while mine was blank. Just a big dark hole. I skipped Thanksgiving but saw them at Christmas, and was able to cope well enough. They weren't showing yet and we were hopeful to try again soon.

We did try again with an adopted embryo which ended in CP right before our state ordered shelter-in and my clinic closed. Now we have no embryos to try again with and can't move forward with anything until things open back up. And every day that passes, July looms closer.

July will be one year since we went back to our RE to try again. It will be my due date for a baby I'll never meet. And it will be the month I somehow have to find the strength to meet my two niblings who will be born.

And I just ask you, how? How will I ever be strong enough to face this? 

When we had that first meeting last July, I never could have imagined a year would go by, and not only will I not have a baby but I won't even be pregnant. And after the miscarriage, oh I'll for sure be pregnant again by the due date and that's how I'll cope. But no.

When I think about this, I feel like I'm suffocating. I feel like I don't ever want to meet these two babies. I don't want to buy gifts and I don't want to hear other family members ooh and aah. I FOR SURE don't want to go to the baby shower that was previously canceled but has now been tentatively rescheduled for June.

I know I'm not the first and won't be the last who sits by and watches as everyone around them has babies. I've never felt so raw, or angry, or bitter, as I do now. Maybe I want someone to tell me to suck it up or maybe I want to be told to allow the anger to burn me up. I don't know.

I had some extended hospital stays awhile back that cost me thousands of dollars and at the time there was just no way we were able to keep up with payments. Since I wasn’t able to work during that time-and for a year afterwards- we had to adjust our life to a single income and that really put a strain on our finances. 

Fast forward to now, we’re in a comfortable place financially and paying off our past bills. However, as I’m sure most of you know, it can take a long ass time to get your credit score back into a decent range and due to insurance reasons we want/need to get the ball rolling with treatment as soon as possible.

So my questions are these: 

* Has anyone else been in this situation and been approved for a loan?
* If so, what companies? (I’m in the US)
* How was your experience getting a loan? (Specifically with poor credit)
* Is there anything we can do to increase our chances of approval aside from getting our credit back up? 

I would be super grateful any information you have on the topic!  

**Stand Alone Post**

I wanted to make this a stand alone post because I couldn’t find anything in the wiki that talks specifically about finances with poor credit. I figured there might be other people on here facing similar issues and this would have more visibility than if it was posted in the dailies.

This is the standard lowest-intervention thing that lesbian couples trying with a known donor use, which is why I’ve done it 4-6 times depending on if you count cycles or tries, and it's extremely simple and way less pressure than fucking. I got a suggestion from /u/Lmahtr to make this a stand-alone post: I know most of us are beyond the point where that's likely to work, but I think I'm in the same boat as many people here where I figure at least the chances aren't zero if I try at home.  I'm lucky to have options that don't suck my soul, and I want you all to have those options too.  

**Supplies:** you'll want a clean dry container, a needleless syringe, (optionally) preseed or another fertility-friendly lube, and (optionally) a menstrual softcup like Instead.  The clean dry container can be a jam jar, a specimen cup, heck, even a glass. Needleless syringes are easy to get on Amz or at your local drugstore -- a 10 ml size is *plenty*, and 5 ml will usually work (might be better for people with a particularly narrow vagina).  Search for ""oral syringes"".  Drugstores usually sell them as kids' medicine syringes.  Because I try at a friend's house, I also bring a towel, my Kindle and phone for smut, snacks, water, and sometimes a blanket. 

**Technique:** sperm person jacks off into a clean dry container. You can use a specimen cup or a jam jar, whatever. If they need lube, use preseed or some other fertility-safe lube. Once the semen is in the cup, you'll want to keep it warm (in someone's cleavage, crotch, or armpit) until it gets used, which should be ASAP.  

Egg person uses a needleless syringe (10 ml size is good, actual turkey basters are way too large) to suck up all the semen, then sticks it as far as possible into the vagina and squirts it out. Egg person then lies there for 20-30 minutes or so with hips elevated or legs up the wall, and ideally has an orgasm to help maximize the odds. (I usually read smut while my donor is working on the sample so I'm more ready to get off myself once I get my cup o' semen.) Before you get up, you can stick an Instead menstrual softcup (NOT a keeper/divacup style) up in there to keep the sperm in overnight or whatever, but it's not really necessary -- most of the actual sperm should have made it through the cervix within 20 minutes or so.


Let me know if you have questions about the mechanics and I will edit. There's also a technique where you put the semen directly in a softcup and then stick that in, but I've always thought I would just spill semen all over the place and not get it anywhere useful. If that seems appealing, I would just do a test run with a little lube in the cup to see if you can actually get it in place around the cervix without spilling anything. 


**Soapbox/Commentary:** Personally I think this should be a standard solution offered to straight people and it's basically just heteronormativity that doctors don't suggest it. (I do know a handful of straight couples who've found it VERY helpful.) It's not clear if it's quite as high a probability as fucking, but tons of lesbians/etc get pregnant that way. And it's just so much easier emotionally. I can get myself off pretty much whenever, but scheduled sex would be a way heavier lift, and fucking when you're not feeling it for months on end can give you bad associations with partnered sex.  Also, if you're up for getting off together but not for penis-in-vagina sex, you could be together for both partners' orgasms; or if it's simpler to just do everything separately, that's fine too.

He has had only one semen analysis to date, about two months ago. All of my testing came back in the desired ranges, and I ovulate regularly, confirmed with basal body temperature charting since Cycle 4. I just finished Cycle 12 a few days ago. We have timed intercourse correctly every cycle.

His numbers:

* Concentration: 23 million/mL
* Morphology: 6%
* Motility: 58%, with progressive motility at 52%
* Total Motile Sperm Count: 36.22 million

Our doctor classified all of his parameters as demonstrating fair fertility potential. We asked at our follow-up appointment if he should see a urologist, and she said that while she does refer a lot of men, in this case, she was confident he would make the same recommendations she was giving us: vitamins and medicated IUI. She did not recommend a second semen analysis. Due to combined insurance and COVID-19 reasons, the earliest we could potentially pursue medicated IUI is late May, which based on my projected cycle dates is more likely to be June.

While we both want children, it is absolutely fair to say I am more impatient to have them quickly. My husband would be fine with things taking longer so that he can become more established in his chosen career field, but isn't opposed to having a baby now, especially since I have access to paid maternity leave and infertility coverage.

I was fairly certain something was wrong when we hadn't conceived by the six-month mark, but getting him to agree to a semen analysis was difficult. Even now that we know the results, he insists that we have a very minor problem that can be easily remedied once we are insurance-eligible to start treatment and our clinic resumes regular operations. My understanding is that our chances of success with medicated IUI are still very low, at about 8-10% per cycle with Clomid or letrozole. My husband has considerable discomfort with the idea of IVF and would rather adopt if we get to that point; I am open to IVF but am not confident we could come to agreement there, so our treatment options are basically IUI or nothing.

I am seeking advice on managing expectations. From what I've read, medicated IUI is hardly the magic bullet my husband thinks it is, and while his semen analysis results are far from drastic, I don't get the impression that they're that great, either. At the same time, I fully acknowledge I have a tendency toward doom and gloom, partially as an emotionally protective measure. Am I being too pessimistic?

I’ve been on trt 140 mg a week for 2.5 years.i take a small amount of hcg and estrogen blockers for maintenance. 
I do not have kids and have always been concerned about future fertility. I got an SA and it came back negative twice. I started it at 29 because my t was at 160. So I wasn’t sure if this was t or an underlying issue. 

I ask the t dr. He starts me on clomid 25mg daily and says it takes 3ish months to see results. I didn’t feel great on it. I only took it for a month and stopped. 

Questions. In that month would it have worked enough to produce some sperm greater than 0?  

If it did, when would/ should I go back and check? When would that sperm be ejaculated?

If it did work, how long after stopping it would it continue working?

Is it reasonable to still be taking trt which raises my t to about 980-720 while trying to produce sperm?

I’m just trying to establish that I can produce. I’m not actually trying to conceive. I didn’t like the pills, but I would take them to conceive.

I’m a 29F and was told at one point that I have PCOS, however all my lab work was normal and it only appears that I had a bunch of cysts on my right ovary only. That being said, I’ve supposedly ovulated the last 2 months I haven’t been on any fertility drug (clomid). This month I’ve gotten Mira which tests the LH in your urine to the hundredth decimal point (.00). So apparently I can’t add a picture of my graph but basically I should be climbing up to my peak in the next 2 days. Here’s my Lh levels starting on Tuesday. Day 1 = 2.08(none), Day 2 = 2.38 (none), day 3 = 2.87 (none), day 4 = 7.36 (low), day 5 = 6.95 (low) shouldn’t be getting lower, and then today day 6 = <1.00 (none) as if I I had gotten my period. I’m upset obviously, but I don’t know why it barely started to climb up and then just dropped to basically nothing. Also Ive tested at my first morning pee. I just want to be normal. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone knows what this means?

I’m a 29F and was told at one point that I have PCOS, however all my lab work was normal and it only appears that I had a bunch of cysts on my right ovary only. That being said, I’ve supposedly ovulated the last 2 months I haven’t been on any fertility drug (clomid). This month I’ve gotten Mira which tests the LH in your urine to the hundredth decimal point (.00). So apparently I can’t add a picture of my graph but basically I should be climbing up to my peak in the next 2 days. Here’s my Lh levels starting on Tuesday. Day 1 = 2.08(none), Day 2 = 2.38 (none), day 3 = 2.87 (none), day 4 = 7.36 (low), day 5 = 6.95 (low) shouldn’t be getting lower, and then today day 6 = &lt;1.00 (none) as if I I had gotten my period. I’m upset obviously, but I don’t know why it barely started to climb up and then just dropped to basically nothing. Also Ive tested at my first morning pee. I just want to be normal. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone knows what this means?

I'm on the last day of cycle 11 after taking two months off for a lap/hysteroscopy that removed silent Stage I endo. Presuming the lap didn't work some magic, I'm trying to decide how to proceed for my next cycle--letrozole with either TI vs IUI--and I figure there are quite a few people here who have been in this same position.

My RE (who is thankfully staying open) wants me to do 3 cycles of IUI now, but I don't particularly trust her. I've talked to an RE at a clinic a few hours away that's doing a clinical trial for IVF, and he thinks I'd be a good candidate (heard about the trial through a post here, cannot thank this group enough for that!!!), but everything's on hold indefinitely due to COVID19. ETA: If I could start IVF right now, I totally would! They don't expect to start cycles again until June right now though, so I'm wondering the best course of action in the meantime.

My question is, do IUIs make sense with mild endo where there's no MFI or other known issues? I understand that the most likely issues are with egg quality and implantation, neither of which IUI addresses, and an IUI would cost \~$1k. I'd love to hear what you read/your RE said/you decided. I did one IUI pre-lap.

And here's a side question--did they have any recommendation regarding diet and lifestyle factors? Mine didn't, but I've been trying to cut way back on sugar, gluten, and refined grains and eat more fish, esp. during fertile week, to try to lessen inflammation.

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

Since my 4th stim cycle for IVF was cancelled due to COVID-19, and my clinic isn't going to start anything until May at the latest, I've been spending too much time thinking about protocols. So I was hoping some of you here could help:

I've done three stim cycles so far. 33 years old, I have low AMH (.57), am poor responder, but unexplained infertility otherwise.

First: BCP microdose lupron (MDL), Gonal F = 5 eggs, 2 embryos, one anembryonic pregnancy.

Second: Natural start MDL, Gonal F = cancelled due to only 2 mature follicles.

Third: BCP MDL, Gonal F and menopur = cancelled due to only 3 mature follicles. This was a hard call. My insurance will pay for unlimited meds and IUIs but only 3 retrievals. So since doc is convinced I can perform better due to history, we decided it made more sense to cancel than waste a retrieval. This cycle we added HGH to stims but since it didn't seem to help, we're not using again.

We now have three protocols to try:

1-estrogen priming with patches alone (one cycle we primed with pills and I had 2 cysts/dominant follicles at baseline. So not trying pills again).

2-estrogen priming with patches and antagonist. We did this for this past cycle that got cancelled and I didn't have any dominant follicles!

3-direct start with no priming. Doc thought this was fine to try but I was worried about early recruitment (I ovulate on my own cd10-12) so we went with option 2 last time.

I want to be able to start as soon as the ban is lifted. Depending on the time in my cycle, I might have time to prime or have to wait a whole other cycle to prime. Is doing direct start a good idea or should I take the time to prime? If so, have people seen a difference with adding the antagonist vs. estrogen alone? Bonus if you've used patches. 

Doc doesn't want to do BCP again due to fears of oversuppression. We'll be doing gonal f/menopur antagonist protocol. Most online says to do MDL for DOR, but obviously that didn't work for me. I've done a LOT of reading of research studies, and would like some more personal stories to add in. Anything at all would be appreciated.

Hey all, bit of background - 27 year old male and I’m from the UK so medical protocols may vary to where you are from.

February 2019 I was diagnosed with testicular cancer and a week later I had surgery to remove the left testicle. Prior to the surgery I was offered the chance to bank sperm, which I accepted but unfortunately no sperm was found. The urologist and I weren’t too concerned about the lack of sperm at that point as there may have been a blockage or cancer had stopped production. I’ve since been bombarded with tests regarding the cancer (now in remission :D).

6 months post-op I was offered sperm banking again but again no sperm found so the urologist put me on the list for micro-TESE surgery in the hope I can bank sperm that way. Before the surgery I had to have a genetic test first.

Sadly they found a complete deletion of AZFb on the Y chromosome (which is required for sperm maturation) and I was removed from the list as NHS would not cover the treatment and the urologist didn’t want to put the remaining testicle at risk of trauma doing the surgery if the outcome was likely to be unsuccessful.

I will appreciate hearing about experience that anyone else has had regarding gene deletions. 

It’s also worth mentioning that I am single and am actively trying to date but finding it extremely difficult due to this double whammy of cancer and gene deletion (I was in a serious relationship up until around May 2019). I don’t know if I should be telling any potential about my history... but I feel I would be leading them on if I don’t, which I personally wouldn’t want to do.

I am 33, TTC 3 years, mild endometriosis diagnosed via laparoscopy in 2005 and again in 2011. I have low AMH.

Been undergoing fertility treatment for 2 years. 3 failed IUI with clomid, 1 failed IUI with injectables. I moved to IVF.

I have had 4 IVF retrievals and 4 embryo transfers (fresh day 5 w/ 3 compacting morulas, fresh day 3 with 2 8-cell low fragmentation embryos, and 2 medicated FETs with day 5 blasts graded 4AB). All of my blood pregnancy tests were less than 1, never pregnant. I had an ERA before the 2 FETs, was pre receptive, and progesterone was adjusted accordingly.

I have 4 Day-5-blasts still frozen (4BB, 4BB, 4BB, 3AB), not PGS tested.

My doctor believes it's an embryo quality issue, but I am not so sure. I am only 33 (started IVF when I was 31). I have endometriosis history and so I am worried about autoimmune issues. I am also concerned about lining issues (tends to be on thinner side between 5-7). Doctor says no and says egg quality issue and I need donor eggs. This is my 5th clinic.

I am worried about going donor egg route and it not working anyway because it's actually a lining or immune issue. I am leaning more toward transferring the frozen blasts I have to a surrogate.

My husband and I developed this chart do help us cope and communicate after 3 years of TTC. It's been a rough fucking journey, <CW> starting from when I almost bled out in the ER from a totally neglected Ectopic Pregnancy rupture, while my poor husband tried to get the staff to respond </CW> up through findings out my ovary with the remaining tube only produces an egg about 1/6 of the time, a miscarriage and a IVF cycle with 0 blastocysts. Needless to say, we are grieving each of these events when they happen and also as they well back up. Also, the increasingly likely possibility that we will never have children.

My husband was raised in a kind of emotionally repressive family culture and is not very natively empathetic, so he has a hard time gauging the severity of my sadness. He also by default tries to hide his sadness, making it difficult for me to gauge his. 

So we developed this chart that's on our fridge to help us support each other and cope, because we have no support network. We update it whenever we're getting something from the fridge. It's been pretty helpful for us, so I wanted to share so people could adapt it to their own circumstances. Hope this helps someone.

At first, the months went by without much issue. No frustration, no anger, no depression. Then the 1 year mark hit and brief episodes of depression started to occur. Each one slightly longer and slightly worse than the last. We’ve seen a RE and have gone through the tests. Lucky us, unexplained infertility. We’ve gone through a few medicated cycles with timed intercourse and just now (yesterday actually) failed our first IUI. What’s hugely disappointing is not that it failed but that I noticed I’m not as upset as with previous cycles. Maybe this is acceptance?? We’ll continue to try, for now that is. But at this point I highly doubt it’ll happen for us and what upsets me most is my wife is twice as upset. Once because we can’t have kids and twice because she can’t give me kids (background..I’ve wanted kids forever. My wife not as much but now wants a big family and feels like she’s let me down. Trust me, I’ve told her she hasn’t.). 

I woke up today with the phrase “in the end it’s only just us” in my head. I have no idea why, but I wrote it down and the rest just came out. It’s really for my wife, and a little me I suppose. It’s not great and I’m sure there are things like it on here (not plagiarized lol), but i just wanted to share with all of you.


Just Us.

In the end, there’s only just Us. 

Long after the kids have grown and moved away,  
Long after all the Christmas mornings and birthday celebrations,
After sleepovers at Grandma’s and Grandpa’s and fun-filled family vacations, 
In the end, there’s only you and me and me and you. 

The best laid plans, ay?
It’s hard to accept the outcome of a decision you had no hand in making. 
Hard to let go of hopes and dreams of a family that could have been. 
It’s thoughts of the little things that cut deepest. 
But that’s how life goes, isn’t it?
And life will continue to go, won’t it?

So here’s to the little things, as the truly big things apparently aren’t meant to be. 
To sleepless nights and early mornings for no reason in particular. 
To having no real responsibility, except being pet parents, of course. 
To romantic vacations and early retirement. 
To having the freedom to do what we want, how we want, when we want.

Here’s to accepting the things we cannot change. 
And here’s to those not-so-little things that have now become big things. 

Because in the end, there’s only just Us.

Sourcing experts is a community effort. If you know of a good candidate, please reach out to them and ask if they’d be interested or point them to this thread. If they are interested, encourage them to [message the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/infertility). While we appreciate suggestions of experts, the mod team is a group of volunteers (busy like everyone else). We can really use help making first contact.

If you ARE an expert and interested, please reach out to us!

Some examples of experts are:

* Reproductive Endocrinologists
* Fertility clinic nurses
* Embryologists/lab workers
* Endometriosis specialists
* Urologists
* Surrogacy/adoption specialists
* Psychologists/Therapists/Counselors who specialize in infertility
* Genetic counselors
* Financial counselors/insurance experts who assist IF patients
* People who work in advocacy related to IF
* Anything we haven’t thought of?

The commitment to hosting an AMA is a few hours of time. We provide more information on hosting to scheduled experts.

<p>This is my friend! A wonderful, caring, brilliant woman who deserves this news and to have a little family of her own. I feel like a horrible person, I&#39;m disappointed our treatment has stopped and the fact I thought so negatively about my friend has made me feel worse.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble and if I&#39;ve insulted anyone, the grief is hitting me hard today and I just know I&#39;m in another TWW that will result in no baby.</p>

I’m a 29 year old female. I do not have PCOS, endo or any other known fertility issue. 

I first had my AMH test done in November 2018. I was told that it was 20. 

My husband then had to work interstate for the first half of 2019 so we took a 6 month break from TTC. We started trying again in June 2019.

Fast forward to early 2020, my husband has his sperm tested and has low count and poor morphology and motility. We get referred to an IVF clinic. 

When we first met with the IVF clinic they wanted me to get some updated blood work done including an AMH test. 

The clinic then closed for an indefinite period of time due to COVID 19, so our plans for treatment were put on hold.

But then I got a call from someone at the clinic on Friday morning to tell me that my AMH had dropped down to 9.6. I understand that this is low for my age but generally not the worst level by any means. However, the clinic told me they wanted to refer me to a specialist right away due to the fact my AMH dropped by over 50% in little more than a year. They told me they are unable to start an ivf cycle though.

I’m absolutely terrified that if clinics have to remain closed for a lengthy period of time my AMH will continue to plummet. I have absolutely no idea why it’s deceased at such a rapid rate. I’m scared that by the time I can actually start ivf I’ll have no eggs or very few eggs remaining. 

Ive been able to make an appointment at another clinic who at this stage is still treating patients, but who knows how long they will be permitted to continue. 

Has anyone had anything similar happened with huge decrease in egg reserve? Does anyone know what may be a cause for this?

Felt I should give a bit of background for those that might be interested in a man's perspective of male infertility.

These past few years have been the most painful years for my wife and I. It started like everyone else, try every month and hope for that positive pregnancy test. It never came. Then came the initial testing, everything with my wife was good. Me on the other hand, zippo, no sperm. A second analysis and the same result. Then came the blood tests, physical exams, and genetic testing, everything was normal. Finally after 18 months of trying and going through testing we discovered a vesicle cyst, a blockage. We decided to perform a single micro-TESE tissue sample at the same time of the cyst aspiration; unfortunately, the tissue sample netted zero sperm. The cyst aspiration didn't change anything either. I schedule the final surgery I would have, a full on TESE. Prior to the surgery though I went on clomid and HCG injections for two months. Studies in Europe have shown both drugs to have a boost in sperm production. Sadly the world came crashing down, the surgery complete and the realization that I was diagnosed with sertoli cell only syndrome. That was it, the realization hit that I would never have a biological child.

It's become clear to me as I deal through these struggles that most infertility sources are geared towards woman. Men seem to hide their emotions and refuse to open up about their struggles. The question I have this evening for everyone who have gone through a similar ordeal and have gone the sperm donor route is how did you, or your husband, deal with the emotional aspect? Call me crazy, but COVID-19 happened at a convenient time. Don't get me wrong, I feel horrible such a terrible pandemic is affecting the entire world, but on a selfish side I'm happy it buys us, and mostly me, time to deal with the emotional stress of not being able to have a child (genetically speaking). I thought I prepared myself for the inevitable bad news from my latest surgery, obviously I didn't prepare at all since the devastation doesn't seem  to vanish despite how open I am about the struggles and the support network we've built.

Any insight on dealing with male infertility, sperm donor (IUI), or anything else you think would help my wife and I would be greatly appreciated.

The COVID megathread will still be posted every Wednesday and Saturday for **specific and detailed** discussions concerning COVID, but we are opening up the themed threads to **brief** mentions of COVID and the quarantine.

So what does that mean?

* Still NO standalones on COVID specific information. Posts that need to go in the COVID thread or to our Chat/Treatment threads will be redirected appropriately.

* Casual mentions of the quarantine and stopping treatment due to COVID can be mentioned in any scheduled threads.

* Detailed discussion around *anything* COVID related needs to go in the COVID thread. Have an article or study you want to discuss? Have an article about making masks or anything super specific to COVID? Talking about how you’re disinfecting outside items? It goes in the COVID thread. 


Let’s break it down:

Did you see the rules on hospital admissions? 👈 COVID thread

I’m so bummed my transfer was cancelled due to COVID. I’m struggling to process it all. 👈 Post in any of our scheduled threads

Did you see this new mask design? I think it’s better than these other masks. 👈 COVID thread

I’ve started wearing a mask when I go out, I just wore it out grocery shopping 👈 Post in any of our scheduled threads as appropriate. (Edited for a bit of clarity)

I just read the new ASRM guidelines, when do you think they’ll start up treatment again? 👈 COVID thread


As always, our approach will continue to shift as the situation changes. For the above new rules, we will post a link to this post on our dailies for the next week.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Infertility includes: primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.

 Background: had successful FET on Feb 5. Where both embryos implanted. Very high HCG levels. Found out at 6 week, 3 day ultrasound that baby B was a blighted ovum. Found out that 8 1/2 week ultrasound which was supposed to be my final one with RE before I graduated  that baby A who had heartbeat of 133 the week before was only measuring at 7 weeks 1 day, and had no heartbeat. Was supposed to get D&C two days later, but was postponed due to covid19. Doctor at group practice told me I could wait to miscarry naturally until D&C. 2 weeks later a different doctor at the practice called me out of the blue and told me I needed to take misoprostol immediately because it wasn't good to wait this long and now nonessential surgeries have been cancelled indefinitely. I took two doses of misoprostol and nothing happened. No cramping, spotting etc. A couple of days later spotting started, and I've had on and off light bleeding (more than spotting as I need a pad, but way lighter than normal period for me) for 5 days now.

My question is anyone know what my next steps are. I was told that the meds can take a week to work which today is a week and to call on Monday if it still hasn't happened. I'm at what would be 11 weeks. My mom, SIL, and MIL all told me that my twins are still alive, and my body would miscarry if they weren't. This is really upsetting to me. I want children so bad, and they're making me feel like I'm choosing to lose them. I think this is because  they never had to go through fertility treatment and didnt realize that miscarriages are often ""missed."" I trust that they aren't viable as I go to an RE with excellent equipment, and had seen the heartbeat easily 2 weeks in a row and then couldn't. Plus she stopped growing.

I'm just scared as the one doctor said that it wasn't good to wait this long, and surgery is not an option and the pills arent working. One of the doctors at the practice said if I get past 12 weeks ( this will mark 4 weeks of waiting for natural) and go to an emergency room I might find one that will consider it an emergency and do a D&C.

I was directed here after spiraling into a near-meltdown after one of my friends announced she was pregnant after only trying for about a year and a half and desperately trying a chat/pseudotherapy site. There's more there, but we'll start with the backstory. If my username didn't tip you off, I'm bitter at this point, so this post will be salty as hell. Read at your own risk.

I am 35, married to my husband 11 years last month, and we've been trying to have a baby for those entire 11 years. After about 4 years, in 2013, we thought something might be wrong because we were young and healthy and wtf why wasn't anything happening. I did all the painful testing first, ready to accept that if the issue was with me, we'd adopt and I'd be fine with that. Everything came back clean.

My husband went to get a semen analysis done. The call came back later ""Congratulations! The vasectomy worked!""

...What?

That's not what we ordered. Send it back. I don't want that.

Queue husband going to a male fertility specialist who prescribes testosterone, orders a varicocele surgery, and generally screws with my husbands hormones until we get some results. We get marginal results, but it's something.

Queue researching fertility treatments and finding out that 1. they are damn expensive and 2. most insurances cover exactly nothing about them, including ours.

We scrimped, we saved, we raided husband's retirement account, and 2ish years ago we were able to start fertility treatments, in lieu of making a down payment on a house.

We went straight to IVF and ICSI and after the first batch of 2 FETs were negative, we now do PGS testing as well. Our second batch resulted in 3 (chromosomally) normal embryos, of which 2 disintegrated upon thawing, and the third resulted in our third negative. That was a blow and resulted in us taking a year off to build up funds for the meds and get some mental health back. This last batch resulted in 2 normal embryos, one of which was transferred at the end of January and came back negative just in time for husband's birthday. Fun.

The fertility people suggested an ERA, which I did at the beginning of March. The results came just before everything shut down, the same day in fact. They called to tell me they were implanting at the incorrect time for my body and that they'd be ready for next time, and then later called to say that the office building they were located was closing indefinitely. So yay.

So back to my friend. She was finding out that she was pregnant about the time that we were getting our 4th negative. I'm happy for her, but she's the nth one since we've started this mess and I'm so tired of it. My cousins have had children, my brother (who I thought never would) has had a child, a girl who started fertility stuff the same time as me has had her baby, hell, I've had kids I *babysat* get married and have kids!

I'm just hoping to find some support here. My family is great, but I haven't told anyone besides my immediate family because they can be over-bearing and just *do not* understand the struggle. My friends are great, but it's hard to be sympathetic when you've heard it before and it's not something you want. Some validation, some commiserating, anything that tells me that I'm not the only one going through this and it's ok to feel jealous and bitter without turning into a horrible person would be great, thanks.",t2_64888mcw,False,,0,False,Long Introduction (sorry folks) and maybe a rant?,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_fumwpe,False,dark,0.78,,public,5,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Introduction,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1586001249.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi all.

My workplace Slack (a group messaging app, for anyone not familiar) has a channel where people post  pictures happy things - typically it's 95% pets and 5% kids. But now that everyone is working from home because of COVID-19, there's been way more going on in that channel, and people (fairly) want to post more to try to boost each other's happiness. There is the odd pregnancy announcement - it's usually an image of a sonogram. I know that I might see that when I go to that channel, so it's fine. I'm prepared for kids and possibly a sonogram pregnancy announcement! But what I'm not prepared for is a five minute long video this guy posted of him and his wife opening an envelope that said ""it's a girl!"" A freaking gender reveal video in my workplace slack. He didn't say that that's what the video was, so of course I watched it, having no idea what it was. Him and his wife are SO happy in it, like so incredibly, authentically happy, and then after they opened the envelope they had this kind of drawn out kiss. That's the point where I figured it was getting kind of inappropriate for this to be posted in a workplace slack. Instagram, sure. Not at work though.

Anyway, a bunch of people reacted saying congrats, while I descended into a meltdown that lasted the rest of the day, and into the next morning. I feel like I put up so many guardrails to make sure this doesn't happen - I think we all do!

So that I can perform at my job and keep my mental health together on a daily basis. And then some dumb thing like this just breaks that box wide open and I'm an epic mess.

I tried to talk to my best friend about it and she absolutely did not get it, and basically said that this was maybe a little weird in a workplace Slack but ultimately not something I could expect to not see. I know that I can't expect people to know that 1 in 8 couples experience infertility and that just *maybe* there's someone in this nearly 200 people workplace that doesn't want to see your gender reveal.

Today on CD 10 I had HyCoSy that showed no abnormalities, and good passage. Sort of yay! However, no dominant follicle (yet I hope), and about 10 small follicles on each ovary, she wrote AFC 19, and lining 9mm. Non medicated cycle.

How does this all sounds to you? It is not too late? Is it just a month I will ovulate late?

Short back story: We are trying for 19 months now, had early loss 17 months ago and nothing since. I have regular cycles (30-34 days), been 5 months on letrozole that shortened cycle for few days but never more than 1 follicle that I mostly have anyway. My AMH is 23 and my husband sperm analysis was very good as they said. I am doing OPK since last summer just before starting Letrozole and my ovulation can be anywhere between CD14 (just once, otherwise CD15) and CD20.

This TTC is really nerve wrecking :(

Title is pretty self-explanatory. I didn’t start my period til I was 14 but it’s always been bad- extreme pain that doesn’t always respond to OTC medicine. As I got older it continued getting worse- my periods were less regular and I almost blacked out in the shower. That was the final straw and I went on BC at 17 to manage it. 
Now, 4 years later, I’ve been dealing with chronic GI issues for well over a year. I thought I had IBS because everything I ate left me bloated and in pain. I was just diagnosed with SIBO two weeks ago and that can apparently be caused by OCPs, so I quit taking them. However, in reading a thread on this sub some people mentioned the exact GI symptoms I had chalked up to IBS as endo signs- sensitivity to things like garlic, constipation, and bloating. 
This week I had my first post-OCP period and I’m terrified. The pain was so awful I was doubled over, shaking, and thought I was going to vomit. I’m fairly certain I blacked out in the shower again because i found myself on the tub floor with no memory of getting there.
