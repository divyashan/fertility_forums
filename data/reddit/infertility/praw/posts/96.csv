I'm 22 and transgender, so I decided to freeze my eggs because 1) I don't plan on carrying a child but do desire a biological child and 2) a decent fraction of trans men and up getting hysterectomies further down the line. 

I got 15 mature eggs and I'm trying to interpret this outcome to determine whether I'd feel comfortable with the fact that I plan to attempt to use these eggs in my early 30s (and if they fail, risking that I might have become infertile or medically require a hysterectomy in the meantime).

 It's hard to find data on the quality of young eggs, so I looked at success rates of donor eggs (which I presume are similar in quality to my own). From what I've seen, a frozen donor embryo transfer has 42% success rate of a live birth. I then looked at the Hunger Games spreadsheet to try and predict how many embryos I might get from my 15 eggs. Regressing the number of Day 5 Embryos on Mature Egg Count and Age, I predict that I will get 6-7 embryos. So I interpret that as a likely 6-7 shots at doing a successful transfer.

I have been TTC for 4.5 years. I have been  doing fertility treatment for about a year. We had some bumps along the way and now we are here. Fast forward - Dr. decided it was best to take out my right Fallopian tube. When I am under, she is going to take a look at everything. 
Best case scenario: both Fallopian tunes can stay and she will be able to remove adhesions on the right side. This would be a miracle. 
Worst Case scenario: The left one may also have some issues based off the imaging, but Dr is optimistic that it is usable. IF it is causing more harm than good then she wants me to tell her my preference of keeping it - and hoping for a miracle chance of having a baby. OR take both tubes out and having ONLY the option of  doing IVF. and because of the issue that it’s causing, I won’t be able to do IVF if I leave it in there. 

Edit added: They can’t do IVF if I keep the Fallopian tube because it is leaking a fluid that they believe is affecting implantation. I have blocked Fallopian tubes. Hydrosalpinx. 

P.S. not related to post - I’m really burnt out on TTC. The last two  months my surgery got rescheduled and I am on birth control. It’s been nice to not be obsessing.

Where to even start...

I'm 27F, my partner is 34M. We've been trying for almost 3 years. The first year, we had a chemical pregnancy. Tried for a year, with no success, so my husband got a semen analysis done. His result was 6mil/ml, and 67% motility. Morphology was not able to be determined. We left things at that, and decided to continue trying since we were able to get pregnant. A year later, another positive. Only this ended in loss. No reason was discovered. A few months later, another success, but this ended up being an ectopic pregnancy. It ruptured and I lost my right fallopian tube. 

During surgery, my doctor visually examined my left tube and said it looked good. Told us to try for 8 months and see what happened. We have been trying for another year with no success. So we got my husband tested again, and I got and HSG.

My HSG showed my remaining tube was open and no abnormalities in my uterus. My husband's results just came back and his count is up to 29mil/ml and ""normal motility"",however, his morphology came back at 0%. Before his results came back, I was prescribed Femara to start next month. My doctor says we can still try if we want, but he doesn't expect that it will work. He is referring us back to the fertility clinic to meet with a doctor there.

My husband has a suspected varicocele, but has never seen a urologist. Would a doctor at the fertility clinic be able to diagnose a varicocele or treat one? I'm wondering if it's pointless to meet with the clinic doctor and if I should just ask for a referral to a urologist right off the bat.

We are feeling extremely discouraged, like there's no chance of another pregnancy without jumping straight to IVF - which we really can't afford. Is it even possible to get pregnant without assistance with 0% morphology? We don't know what his first SA was in terms of morphology so we don't know if it's even possible.

I’m 25 and my husband and I are thinking about conceiving, but I haven’t gotten my period since January 2020.

I was on Nuvaring from 2014-2020 where I got my period every month. In 2018-2019 I started skipping months as I was stressed (parents divorce and wedding), but I didn’t think much of it. I also live a very active lifestyle which I know can complicate a cycle.

I always thought I had atypical PCOS. I have hormonal acne and migraines, but don’t struggle with severe weight gain. I had my doc give me an internal and external ultrasound and they found cysts on my ovaries, confirming the atypical PCOS.

Once they found the cysts, I panicked and took out my nuvaring back in January. It’s been 7 months and I still haven’t gotten my period back. I’ve been on 2 full 10 day rounds of Provera and still no period. My reproductive endocrinologist has laid out a plan for me with the next steps being Letrozole.

We realize the AM/PM distinction doesn't work for every timezone, just use the most recently posted one (you can sort the sub by ""new"" to find this easily).  It also helps tremendously if you upvote the daily threads when you see them so they stay at the top of the sub making them easier for others to find.

The daily Treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or treatment related questions.  It's a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help.

The daily Chat threads are for anything and everything not related to treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won't stop asking about when you're having kids? Funny story? Rant? These all go in the Chat thread. This is a great place to get to know fellow members outside of their treatment or diagnosis.   

Have a question that you think might warrant a standalone post or doesn't fit in the treatment/chat threads?

We realize the AM/PM distinction doesn&#39;t work for every timezone, just use the most recently posted one (you can sort the sub by &quot;new&quot; to find this easily).  It also helps tremendously if you upvote the daily threads when you see them so they stay at the top of the sub making them easier for others to find.</p>

<p>The daily Treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or treatment related questions.  It&#39;s a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help.</p>

<p>The daily Chat threads are for anything and everything not related to treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won&#39;t stop asking about when you&#39;re having kids? Funny story? Rant? These all go in the Chat thread. This is a great place to get to know fellow members outside of their treatment or diagnosis.   </p>

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result.

We are on our first round of IVF, we have tried on our own for many years and were recently diagnosed with both unexplained infertility and slight male factor (low morphology). We tried IUIs  on Letrozole with no success. My body responded well to 5 days of the Letrozole at 7.5mg, and produced about 10 follicles on the left ovary. With IVF Stims, I was expecting it to be even higher. I’m getting worried because I’m afraid that may not be the case. I’m on day 5 of 300 units of Gonal F  And 150 IU Menopur. I had my first ultrasound on day 3 of Stims and had 4 follicles on the left - less than 10mm and 3 less than 10mm on the right with 1 13mm. They brought me in the next day (today) after taking the 4th night of injections to see if that 13mm grew, in which case I would begin Ceterotide. My concern is that today, the ultrasound showed 5 follicles on each side, all less than 10mm - and the 13mm was nowhere to be found. I asked the nurse if this was okay and I was just told “it’s a slow process”. Usually I love the office I go to, but this answer was not very helpful. I only received 8 days worth of Gonal F and Menopur, and I’m worried about nearing the end with such little progress. With the meds being $4k alone and the cost of everything else, I’m afraid we won’t be able to try this again any time soon and I’m not producing enough follicles to have the best chances of multiple good embryos after the PGS testing. We are also doing ICSI and frozen egg transfer-if we get there! Sorry for the rant, I know they say to relax - but I feel like I’m spiraling a little here! 

I would love to hear other people’s experiences with similar meds. How many follicles did you have on days 3/4? My next ultrasound will be on day 7 (I take the shots at night so by this ultrasound I will have 6 days of Stims down) has anyone had their meds increased at that point and had better success?

I had clockwork, regular, perfect periods all my life, no reason to suspect I'd have any problems conceiving.  6 years ago I turned 37, still no partner that would make a good dad, so I bit the bullet and reluctantly went in to freeze some eggs.  I assumed it'd go fine, I'd do one round and be done.   

I got a horrible shock, my AMH was near zero.  Autoimmune related.  I went through 3 immediate, emergency rounds of freezing.  I got 7 eggs total (poor result).  They wanted me to do a 4th round, emotionally I couldn't handle it right then so I went in a year later and had actual zero left.  When the doc saw this, he gently hinted this may indicate that the 7 I did get the year before are poor quality.   

Those 7 are still on ice but I've spent years grieving in secret.  People who know me casually assume I'm strong, lucky.  They don't know what I've lost.  I don't have a family I can talk to, only a Cluster B abusive mother, a hateful brother, no partner yet (broke up a 2 year relationship 6 months ago).  No one.

I feel a constant sense of betrayal.  I am still working on my feelings, knowing that I need to choose a healthy path to heal without bitterness but I'm so not there yet, and I need help.

I tried to make lemonade and gently encouraged my friends in their 30s to freeze but no one wanted to hear it (I understand that).  I just came off as a buzzkill, so I stopped.  

The hurt is constant and very hard to accept.  I'm also starting to believe men are irredeemably selfish and a waste of time.

Tests done 7/7/2020 

I am a 26 y/o fm. I have had irregular periods since I can remember. I don’t know if it’s necessary to go into years of detail.. compared to most I am on the beginning of this journey and already finding myself riddled with anxiety and going down rabbit holes. I’m struggling to balance being my own advocate while also not being obsessive/compulsive. However, if I wasn’t being obsessive I wouldn’t have caught the doctors mistake she just admitted to.

I had a miscarriage in February of 2019. I wasn’t trying to get pregnant.. but had been having unprotected sex with my boyfriend for about 18 months. I thought I couldn’t get pregnant bc of how infrequent my periods were.. (I realize how misinformed I was). 
After I got pregnant and miscarried I began really educating myself on tracking my cycle to avoid this happening again. I didn’t want to go on birth control bc of all the size affects I experienced in the past. 

A few things happened when I started tracking my cycle: 
- my periods became much more regular after I miscarried. On average they occur every 39 days which I recognize is longer than normal 
- I do not show normal signs of ovulating. I have fertile mucus at the wrong time, dont have normal temp drop 
- I started connecting a ton of dots and recognizing symptoms 
  - fatigue 
 - hair in unwanted places.. increasing over last 2-3 years (nipples and chin
- hair thinning 
-irritability 
Just literally so much. 

After about a year of tracking and reading books I became more aware of my health and the possibility of having PCOS. Originally my doctor said there were a million reasons I could have miscarried.. but it wouldn’t be worth to explore it since i wasn’t going to continue to try to conceive. Not once did she mention anything about an-ovulation despite knowing my irregular cycles. I finally demanded I get my hormones tested and then got these results. 

She did not check my estrogen levels. Everything else including my testosterone is normal. After I pointed out my lh is actually extremely high for my cycle time she “corrected her mistake” and said even tho my androgen is normal she reccomends I get an ultra sound and also check estrogen. She said my high lh in luteal phase, irregular (long cycles) and cysts could be enough to diagnose PCOS.


I really need some help and support about what next steps I should take. I’m worried about my health, my ability to get pregnant in the future, and my mental health. I’m so emotional but also partially relieved that I’m getting closer to figuring out what is wrong. I’m nervous about my ultrasound coming back “normal” and what else could be wrong with me.

All our tests (HSG, AMH, semen analysis) have come back with good results. I also don’t have PCOS or endometriosis. Based on what we currently know, just my biological clock is off, and as a result, I am being treated for a luteal phase defect.

I did 4 cycles of Letrozole with bad side effects (awful anxiety, lining thinning). Last cycle, we switched over to a natural, monitored cycle with Tamoxifen and injections (Follistim, Ganirelix, and Pregnyl). Unfortunately, no success, and all the hormone treatments resulted in a follicular cyst. 

We are currently taking a cycle off from treatment, except for progesterone during my luteal phase. If it doesn’t happen for us this cycle, my doctor seems to be pushing for IUI as our next step. 

Is there another test or step I should consider before deciding on IUI? We’ve discussed a postcoital test, but is it worth it if we haven’t gotten pregnant naturally with hormone treatments? From what I understand, if the results come back abnormal, then the next step would be IUI. If the results come back normal...then what?

I shared this with another woman on my day of the week treatment chat- but I thought it might be helpful to many more people who are worried about or unhappy with the way they are doing thier own progesterone injections. (We will also make one on how to give yourself the injections in a safe spot in your upper thigh if anyone is interested).

*Putting timeline in bullet points to make it easier to understand*

My cycles have been pretty consistently 24-26 days long for the past 2.5 years.

* Started Letrozole on 25/6 for cycle days 3-7
* Solid positive OPK on cycle day 10 at 8:30am along with EWCM mixed with light pink blood.
* Went for U/S on the same day at 1:30pm- no mature follicles (they were too small need a measurement) They assumed I might have ovulated, but P4 came back at 0.43
* Endometrial lining was at an ideal thickness for my cycle day and expected ovulation.
* Rescheduled U/S for cycle day 12
* Strong positive OPK on cycle day 11 at 4pm. Went in next morning at 10:30am on cycle day 12 for another U/S but still no mature follicles. Largest one measured at only 8mm.
* Uterine lining was still at a really great thickness, but APRN was a little concerned that my follicle growth is too slow compared to how thick my lining is getting.
* P4 came back at 1.46, E2 came back at 122.5.
* Rescheduled another U/S for cycle day 16 which is on 8/7

The doctor working that day (this was a Saturday at a different clinic location than we normally go to) said that my bloodwork shows my follicles are still growing, just at a slow pace and it might not be an issue. I try not to be much of an “armchair doctor” however, I am a little curious as to why this is happening.

Why are my follicles so small compared to the thickness of my lining? I know false positives on OPKs are a thing, but I’ve been doing this shit for 5.5 years- I damn well know a positive from a negative.

Has anyone else had a similar situation? Was it an issue that needed to be addressed or was it not a big deal? We’re prepared for this cycle to be cancelled since it seems my only dominate follicle is on my left side*, but it’d be nice to get some information for future cycles.

Maybe the embryos are healthier in an invisible way. I don’t regret my decision.

Hi, I'm second-guessing my decision about what to do next and just want to make sure I'm not crazy.

I have stage IV endo, difficult transfers, and 4 failed PGS transfers. You can read my whole sad story [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/h9m2l5/where_to_go_from_here_fourth_failed_transfer_with/) We have 1 PGS normal left and 2 mosaics.

We've just switched to a new clinic and a new RE who is an endo expert. Unlike our previous RE, he is not a great communicator, but I'm OK with that. We loved our first doc, but she didn't get me pregnant. She also knew a lot less about endo. This new clinic is supposed to be the best in town, should have a better lab, and slightly higher success rates. We'll be doing the ERA, finally, and probably Lupron Depot again.

New doc strongly recommends surgery first to excise endo, including the 3cm endometrioma on one ovary. I'm worried about the tradeoff: This surgery, he agrees, will lower my AMH (which has always been good, 3.7). Wouldn't it be safer to make more embryos first, then do surgery after? ""You aren't going to get much from that ovary now anyway,"" he said, since the cyst is so large. But last year, at my second retrieval, it was about the same size and we still got 4 PGS normals. He didn't really have an answer to that.

He said we can do the retrieval first if we really insist, but he wasn't happy about it. So we agreed to the surgery. We did some research and felt reassured that he's not way off-base—[this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6333762/), for example, states that the European version of ASRM's guidelines call for removing >3cm endometriomas before IVF. Also, could it be that my embryos had an invisible quality issue? Maybe it will be better to grow eggs in a healthier environment after the endo has been taken out. Quality over quantity.

We came to this doctor for a new approach, and that's what he is offering. But I'm fearful that we may have difficulty making enough embryos after surgery. Ugh.

I am so emotionally drained by infertility issue and I want some support.  Been married and TTC for 6 years but no luck.  Finally booked with RE in 4/2020 but found out my hormone, my body all in bad shape despite I've a normal BMI, regular periods and I do not drink or smoke.

Background: F38M40, TTC6yrs

1) Baseline 4/2020

CD3 blood work: FSH 4.76, LH 6.56, E2 176, Prolactin 735 (high)

RE put me on Bromocriptine 2.5mg and started Menopur injection in my first month.  RE decided to use the first month as warm up and adviced me to go natural for timed intercourse.  But in fact my ovaries are not responding much to stim and only got 2-3 appropriate sized follicles.  Of cuz no miracles occurred.

2) 5/2020, I didnt try anything as I had bad asthma and had to see respiratory doc and gave myself a month off.

3) 6/2020, RE decided to start real work and put me on Suprepur nasal spray 3 times a day, coupled with Menopur injection.  I was so bloated during the cycle after stepping up the injection.   I was hopeful during the AFC scan on CD10 when my RE commented that my ovaries finally woke up and got around 3-4 follicles reaching 14mm follicles.  I planned ahead and had taken a day off from work to time sex. There the bad news came.  RE called me the same day afternoon, informing I've got high progesterone level \~7 (not sure about the unit).  RE told me I ve to do trigger shot that evening right away even when my follicles were just 14mm.  I read up the negative impact of premature high progesterone level and my heart sank.  I knew the cycle would go into a waste.  I was in such low mood that my husband and I failed to do it. Was in fact quite sick being bloated, breast tenerderness, cramps and diarrhea for the whole week.  RE said its due to prostaglandin.  Went back to see RE few days later and she told me to consider IVF instead of trying IUI or anything as high progesterone level means poor prognosis.  I have been naive that I thought I can be pregnant after ovarian stimulation + IUI but now I felt like thunder clouds just dawn onto my world.  This cycle also went all weird.  I just have my period today, assuming a constant 14-day luteal phase, my follicular phase was only 8 days!  Short cycle is basically a sign of approaching menopause.  I cried many times in all these years and before I was telling myself to stay positive and hope for the best.  Now with the hard facts of poor hormonal profiles, inadequate ovarian response, out-of-sync uterus, I feel defeated. 

I am sorry for whining but I cant help with it.  I know many of your ladies have tried many times before miracles occur.  I work in healthcare sector myself and my work has to deal with many mothers.  I am responsible for dealing with child abuse cases and I get angry every time when managing these abusive mothers in past 10 years.  Now I feel like depressed as I consider myself a hardworking and caring person and yet I cant have my own child while my clients could get pregnant child after child and not taking care of them and yelling and displacing their unreasonable temper to me and other welfare staff for their problems created by themselves.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Infertility includes: primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.

Hi all! So a little backstory I was diagnosed with Pcos over a year ago after being misdiagnosed with Endo. I was in such a bad place mentally I just stopped seeing doctors because I was fed up with so many medications. Once I was off BC it took 9mths for my cycle to return. I've been eating healthy and lost maybe 10-15Ibs. My cycle is the most regular it's ever been (falling in the same week of the month) for a year now. 

Recently though within the pass 4mths I've notice a lot of what I can only assume is cervical mucus from what I've been reading. 
It happens around the time my period app says is my fertile window. My main concern is that when I say a lot I mean A LOT, like I stand up and it just starts running down my legs. Is this normal? I know some women with pcos show signs of ovulation but aren't really ovulating. I've never had this symptom in my cycle before. It's just super weird and uncomfortable but I've been trying/not trying to conceive for 5yrs now so if it's a good sign I'll take it lol 
I haven't been seriously charting or taking any ovulation tests because knowing myself I'll get super crazy with it and my periods were all over the place and I just felt it wasn't worth my mental health to seriously try. BUT if my body is finally showing some signs that it does work I'll give it a go.

They are ttc for over a year and a half now (she had MA lately) and they also know about our struggles.

I started to yell at him like crazy about how stupid his fear is and what me and my sis had to go through and he is not even able to jerk off in the stupid  plastic cup!

154,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"**A Reddit Guide to Choosing a Fertility Clinic**

I asked for Reddit’s advice on choosing a fertility clinic and things that people wish they had known before choosing a clinic. This is a compilation of that advice, and I hope it can serve as a useful resource whether you’re just starting your infertility journey or looking to make a switch.  This document is a crowd-sourced work, and thank you to everyone who responded and contributed to the information below.

Please feel to comment, add information, point out of errors, disagree, etc. in the comments below.  I will update, add, and correct as necessary.  \[Last edit July 12, 2020\]

**General advice**

If you can, consider doing consultations at more than one clinic so you can compare and contrast and get an idea of what clinics are like, especially if this is your first time dealing with infertility. And remember, if you’re with a clinic that isn’t a good fit, you are under no obligation to stay.  There are some logistics about transferring frozen embryos and differences in freezing standards and protocols that can complicate transportation of frozen embryos, but in the end, if you feel the need to switch, there is probably a good reason for it.

&#x200B;

**Data and Statistics**

There are two main sets of national assisted reproductive technology clinic success data: the CDC and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology

CDC: [https://www.cdc.gov/art/artdata/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/art/artdata/index.html)

Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology: sart.org

\- Redditors generally agree that SART is the more useful of the two data sets and that success data is one of the most important factors in choosing a clinic (with some caveats). There are clinics with great marketing but poor success rates and in the end, they’re not going to get you what you want.

\- While the clinic you choose doesn’t have to be the best in terms of SART data, you should use the data as a threshold and at least pick a clinic with pretty good or above average statistics. If the stats are lower for a clinic you’re interested in, you can  consider the stats as a discussion point. For instance, are the stats lower because the clinic specializes in women with diminished ovarian reserve and mini IVF where people come in knowing that they’re going to do several egg retrievals?  Or perhaps the clinic is patient driven and will keep doing cycles with women, even if they have low odds.  Or do they just tell you that the stats are meaningless or make excuses, which is more concerning.

\- Look specifically at the stats for women in your age group for the most relevance

\- Take the stats with a grain of salt when comparing stats between clinics because patient population may be different (some clinics cherry pick, decline hard cases, require donor eggs for women above a certain age, etc.)

\- You can look at donor egg stats as a baseline for clinic quality because donor eggs are usually from young, healthy women (i.e. best case scenarios) and can help give you an idea of success between clinics

\- If you are located outside of the US, here are a couple of other databases you can review.  The quality varies but at least can give you a starting point to your search:

UK: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority:  [https://www.hfea.gov.uk/](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/) 

Portugal: Associacao Portuguesa de Fertilidade:  [https://www.apfertilidade.org/](https://www.apfertilidade.org/) 

France: Agence de la Biomedicine:  [https://www.agence-biomedecine.fr/Evaluation-des-resultats-des-centres-d-assistance-medicale-a-la-procreation?lang=fr](https://www.agence-biomedecine.fr/Evaluation-des-resultats-des-centres-d-assistance-medicale-a-la-procreation?lang=fr)and fiv.fr  [https://www.fiv.fr/classement-2019-des-centres-de-pma-et-fiv-en-france/](https://www.fiv.fr/classement-2019-des-centres-de-pma-et-fiv-en-france/) 

&#x200B;

**Clinic characteristics**

**Doctors:**

\- Who will you be seeing for your appointments? Will it be one doctor or will you see a group of doctors interchangeably? Will you be seeing primarily a doctor for most of your appointments or will it be a nurse or MA? Will you see different doctors for different procedures depending on what you’re doing?

\- Do you get along with the doctor? Infertility is an intensive process with many emotional ups and downs. Do you feel like you get along with the doctor and the doc will support you through the process, particularly if things go wrong or are hard? Some people think that bedside manner is secondary to success rates or prefer “blunt” doctors, but when the going gets tough or if there is an error or complication, having an understanding or patient doctor can be really important.

**Clinic:**

\- Does the clinic do procedures every day of the week (including weekends if needed)? This is going to be important to individually tailor and time treatments to you and your schedule.  You risk delays in your cycles or less ideal procedure dates if the clinic doesn’t open on the weekends if needed. Some readers have even had cancelled cycles because of timing.

\- Does the clinic batch clients? Some clinics will use strategically use birth control to start/delay cycles so everyone is on the same schedule. Does the clinic do this or are they flexible as to start date, etc. Again, this is important in terms of scheduling to match your body and your lifestyle.

\- Do you want a bigger clinic with bigger resources and maybe a more state of the art lab but possibly less personal attention or tailoring of treatment or do you want a smaller clinic where you may see the same doctors and nurses each visit?

\- Is there someone on call or available 24/7 in the event of emergencies? Will messages be checked on weekends?  It is common for last-minute questions or needs to come up (lost medications, unclear instructions, abnormal bleeding, etc.). Is there a mechanism to quickly and efficient contact the clinic and importantly, will the clinic return your phone call after hours and on weekends?

\- Clinic/physician philosophy:  As you go through the IVF process, you'll find that different physicians and clinics have different approaches, philosophies, and workups.  As a first-time patient, you can ask things like whether the clinic transfers mosaic embryos (as opposed to automatically categorizing them as ""abnormal"", what is their opinion on using ICSI or PGS embryo testing?   There are a variety of person-specific questions that may come up, such as their knowledge, approach, and workup if you have an autoimmune disease, what they'll do if you have several failed cycles, retrievals, transfers, or a history of multiple miscarriages, etc.  In more complicated situations like this, you want to know that the clinic is able to tailor a solution for you, rather than repeatedly using the same cookie cutter approach.

**Nurses and staff:**

\- You will also spend *a lot* of time dealing with nurses and staff in planning appointments, treatments, test results, patient education, billing and payment, etc. This shouldn’t be a top priority in your choice, but if you are having horrible experiences with the staff or finding it difficult to talk to a real person or get answers to your questions in a timely fashion, you may consider switching clinics.

&#x200B;

**Lab**

While the lab is generally not patient facing, it is equally as important as the clinic, as it is the lab that plays a big role in the technical aspects of infertility treatment. You want a lab that is up to date on technology and knowledgeable about current data and research. If you can get a chance to speak to the embryologist, you should consider doing that.

There are many factors that impact lab quality, including experience of the embryologists, protocols, how controlled the environment is, location in the building, etc. It’s important to look at clinic success rates via the resources listed above, but also ask about the lab quality. Per Fertility IQ, here are some reasonable questions to ask and benchmarks to use:

\- fertilization rate (both Conventional Insemination and ICSI).

\- the blastocyst conversion rate (how many fertilized eggs make it to a day 3 or day 5 blastocycst, which translates to an embryo that can be transferred)

\- successful PGS biopsy rate (what percentage of embryo biopsies result in a genetic testing result, as opposed to a result of inconclusive or insufficient DNA. Are those biopsies done by hand or are they laser assisted?)

**Geography/Location**

Many fertility appointments need to be scheduled at the last minute depending on test results, and there are situations where you are at the clinic daily. The convenience of the clinic in terms of hours of operation and location are important, and you should be aware of the flexibility of the clinic, what days they do procedures, etc. Do their hours of operation work with your work or life schedule? Some people choose, have to, or are able to go to clinics that are far away but note that far distance can make logistics difficult.

&#x200B;

**Cost**

This is obviously going to be based on individual circumstances. Some people are limited to clinics within their insurance network and others are entirely out of pocket. All clinics are pricey from an out of pocket standpoint, so some people recommend choosing the clinic that is the best fit with the best success rates and using cost as a secondary measure because a successful cycle that is more expensive is still cheaper than multiple cheaper cycles.

\- If you do have insurance coverage, check to see if both the fertility doc and the embryologist are in network. If the embryologist is out of network, you may end up paying those expenses as out of network expenses.

\- You can also consider how a clinic bills: “my current clinic is slightly more expensive on paper than the second clinic, but they are very good at using diagnosis codes that my insurance will accept (in the US with ""good"" employer-based insurance). I technically had no ""infertility"" coverage until changing jobs recently, but they have done a good job of coding things as ""suspected endometriosis"" or ""ovulation disorder"" etc. that my insurance would accept, and my out of pocket costs have been lower. They also have a financial counselor in-house who has been helpful with reminding me to try and time things around plan years for deductibles, etc. and I would recommend looking for a clinic that has a financial counselor if cost is a concern. however, if you know that you don't have any insurance coverage it may actually be a better deal to go to a clinic that doesn't even accept insurance.”

&#x200B;

**Reviews**

\- There is some utility for online reviews as a summary of the above factors. Fertility IQ reviews tend to be the most in-depth and most redditors consider them the best. Yelp reviews can help gauge the doctor and staff. But most people consider the clinic stats to be more important factors than user review sites.",t2_6ff1aeqp,False,,0,False,A Guide to Choosing a Fertility Clinic,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_hkkon1,False,dark,0.96,,public,73,1,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,73,,False,self,1594579685.0,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1593817691.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><strong>A Reddit Guide to Choosing a Fertility Clinic</strong></p>

<p>I asked for Reddit’s advice on choosing a fertility clinic and things that people wish they had known before choosing a clinic. This is a compilation of that advice, and I hope it can serve as a useful resource whether you’re just starting your infertility journey or looking to make a switch.  This document is a crowd-sourced work, and thank you to everyone who responded and contributed to the information below.</p>

<p>Please feel to comment, add information, point out of errors, disagree, etc. in the comments below.  I will update, add, and correct as necessary.  [Last edit July 12, 2020]</p>

<p><strong>General advice</strong></p>

<p>If you can, consider doing consultations at more than one clinic so you can compare and contrast and get an idea of what clinics are like, especially if this is your first time dealing with infertility. And remember, if you’re with a clinic that isn’t a good fit, you are under no obligation to stay.  There are some logistics about transferring frozen embryos and differences in freezing standards and protocols that can complicate transportation of frozen embryos, but in the end, if you feel the need to switch, there is probably a good reason for it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Data and Statistics</strong></p>

<p>There are two main sets of national assisted reproductive technology clinic success data: the CDC and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology</p>

<p>CDC: <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/art/artdata/index.html"">https://www.cdc.gov/art/artdata/index.html</a></p>

<p>Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology: sart.org</p>

<p>- Redditors generally agree that SART is the more useful of the two data sets and that success data is one of the most important factors in choosing a clinic (with some caveats). There are clinics with great marketing but poor success rates and in the end, they’re not going to get you what you want.</p>

<p>- While the clinic you choose doesn’t have to be the best in terms of SART data, you should use the data as a threshold and at least pick a clinic with pretty good or above average statistics. If the stats are lower for a clinic you’re interested in, you can  consider the stats as a discussion point. For instance, are the stats lower because the clinic specializes in women with diminished ovarian reserve and mini IVF where people come in knowing that they’re going to do several egg retrievals?  Or perhaps the clinic is patient driven and will keep doing cycles with women, even if they have low odds.  Or do they just tell you that the stats are meaningless or make excuses, which is more concerning.</p>

<p>- Look specifically at the stats for women in your age group for the most relevance</p>

<p>- Take the stats with a grain of salt when comparing stats between clinics because patient population may be different (some clinics cherry pick, decline hard cases, require donor eggs for women above a certain age, etc.)</p>

<p>- You can look at donor egg stats as a baseline for clinic quality because donor eggs are usually from young, healthy women (i.e. best case scenarios) and can help give you an idea of success between clinics</p>

<p>- If you are located outside of the US, here are a couple of other databases you can review.  The quality varies but at least can give you a starting point to your search:</p>

<p>UK: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority:  <a href=""https://www.hfea.gov.uk/"">https://www.hfea.gov.uk/</a> </p>

<p>Portugal: Associacao Portuguesa de Fertilidade:  <a href=""https://www.apfertilidade.org/"">https://www.apfertilidade.org/</a> </p>

<p>France: Agence de la Biomedicine:  <a href=""https://www.agence-biomedecine.fr/Evaluation-des-resultats-des-centres-d-assistance-medicale-a-la-procreation?lang=fr"">https://www.agence-biomedecine.fr/Evaluation-des-resultats-des-centres-d-assistance-medicale-a-la-procreation?lang=fr</a>and fiv.fr  <a href=""https://www.fiv.fr/classement-2019-des-centres-de-pma-et-fiv-en-france/"">https://www.fiv.fr/classement-2019-des-centres-de-pma-et-fiv-en-france/</a> </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Clinic characteristics</strong></p>

<p><strong>Doctors:</strong></p>

<p>- Who will you be seeing for your appointments? Will it be one doctor or will you see a group of doctors interchangeably? Will you be seeing primarily a doctor for most of your appointments or will it be a nurse or MA? Will you see different doctors for different procedures depending on what you’re doing?</p>

<p>- Do you get along with the doctor? Infertility is an intensive process with many emotional ups and downs. Do you feel like you get along with the doctor and the doc will support you through the process, particularly if things go wrong or are hard? Some people think that bedside manner is secondary to success rates or prefer “blunt” doctors, but when the going gets tough or if there is an error or complication, having an understanding or patient doctor can be really important.</p>

<p><strong>Clinic:</strong></p>

<p>- Does the clinic do procedures every day of the week (including weekends if needed)? This is going to be important to individually tailor and time treatments to you and your schedule.  You risk delays in your cycles or less ideal procedure dates if the clinic doesn’t open on the weekends if needed. Some readers have even had cancelled cycles because of timing.</p>

<p>- Does the clinic batch clients? Some clinics will use strategically use birth control to start/delay cycles so everyone is on the same schedule. Does the clinic do this or are they flexible as to start date, etc. Again, this is important in terms of scheduling to match your body and your lifestyle.</p>

<p>- Do you want a bigger clinic with bigger resources and maybe a more state of the art lab but possibly less personal attention or tailoring of treatment or do you want a smaller clinic where you may see the same doctors and nurses each visit?</p>

<p>- Is there someone on call or available 24/7 in the event of emergencies? Will messages be checked on weekends?  It is common for last-minute questions or needs to come up (lost medications, unclear instructions, abnormal bleeding, etc.). Is there a mechanism to quickly and efficient contact the clinic and importantly, will the clinic return your phone call after hours and on weekends?</p>

<p>- Clinic/physician philosophy:  As you go through the IVF process, you&#39;ll find that different physicians and clinics have different approaches, philosophies, and workups.  As a first-time patient, you can ask things like whether the clinic transfers mosaic embryos (as opposed to automatically categorizing them as &quot;abnormal&quot;, what is their opinion on using ICSI or PGS embryo testing?   There are a variety of person-specific questions that may come up, such as their knowledge, approach, and workup if you have an autoimmune disease, what they&#39;ll do if you have several failed cycles, retrievals, transfers, or a history of multiple miscarriages, etc.  In more complicated situations like this, you want to know that the clinic is able to tailor a solution for you, rather than repeatedly using the same cookie cutter approach.</p>

<p><strong>Nurses and staff:</strong></p>

<p>- You will also spend <em>a lot</em> of time dealing with nurses and staff in planning appointments, treatments, test results, patient education, billing and payment, etc. This shouldn’t be a top priority in your choice, but if you are having horrible experiences with the staff or finding it difficult to talk to a real person or get answers to your questions in a timely fashion, you may consider switching clinics.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Lab</strong></p>

<p>While the lab is generally not patient facing, it is equally as important as the clinic, as it is the lab that plays a big role in the technical aspects of infertility treatment. You want a lab that is up to date on technology and knowledgeable about current data and research. If you can get a chance to speak to the embryologist, you should consider doing that.</p>

<p>There are many factors that impact lab quality, including experience of the embryologists, protocols, how controlled the environment is, location in the building, etc. It’s important to look at clinic success rates via the resources listed above, but also ask about the lab quality. Per Fertility IQ, here are some reasonable questions to ask and benchmarks to use:</p>

<p>- fertilization rate (both Conventional Insemination and ICSI).</p>

<p>- the blastocyst conversion rate (how many fertilized eggs make it to a day 3 or day 5 blastocycst, which translates to an embryo that can be transferred)</p>

<p>- successful PGS biopsy rate (what percentage of embryo biopsies result in a genetic testing result, as opposed to a result of inconclusive or insufficient DNA. Are those biopsies done by hand or are they laser assisted?)</p>

<p>- What kind of incubators are used (you want low-oxygen incubators that aren’t crowded)</p>

<p>- Rates to look for: For CI, around 75% fertilization for an excellent lab vs. 60% for a “passable” lab. 80% vs. 70% for ICSI. At an excellent lab, 70% of blasts make it to day three and 60% to day five. Whereas, at a passable lab, it will be 45% and 40%. They also mentioned that 99% of embryos should survive thaw at an excellent lab, compared to 90% at a passable lab.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Geography/Location</strong></p>

<p>Many fertility appointments need to be scheduled at the last minute depending on test results, and there are situations where you are at the clinic daily. The convenience of the clinic in terms of hours of operation and location are important, and you should be aware of the flexibility of the clinic, what days they do procedures, etc. Do their hours of operation work with your work or life schedule? Some people choose, have to, or are able to go to clinics that are far away but note that far distance can make logistics difficult.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>

<p>This is obviously going to be based on individual circumstances. Some people are limited to clinics within their insurance network and others are entirely out of pocket. All clinics are pricey from an out of pocket standpoint, so some people recommend choosing the clinic that is the best fit with the best success rates and using cost as a secondary measure because a successful cycle that is more expensive is still cheaper than multiple cheaper cycles.</p>

<p>- If you do have insurance coverage, check to see if both the fertility doc and the embryologist are in network. If the embryologist is out of network, you may end up paying those expenses as out of network expenses.</p>

<p>- You can also consider how a clinic bills: “my current clinic is slightly more expensive on paper than the second clinic, but they are very good at using diagnosis codes that my insurance will accept (in the US with &quot;good&quot; employer-based insurance). I technically had no &quot;infertility&quot; coverage until changing jobs recently, but they have done a good job of coding things as &quot;suspected endometriosis&quot; or &quot;ovulation disorder&quot; etc. that my insurance would accept, and my out of pocket costs have been lower. They also have a financial counselor in-house who has been helpful with reminding me to try and time things around plan years for deductibles, etc. and I would recommend looking for a clinic that has a financial counselor if cost is a concern. however, if you know that you don&#39;t have any insurance coverage it may actually be a better deal to go to a clinic that doesn&#39;t even accept insurance.”</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Reviews</strong></p>

<p>- There is some utility for online reviews as a summary of the above factors. Fertility IQ reviews tend to be the most in-depth and most redditors consider them the best. Yelp reviews can help gauge the doctor and staff. But most people consider the clinic stats to be more important factors than user review sites.</p>

Has anyone recently looked into/done IVF in the Portland area.


Husband and I are just starting the IVF process. My insurance will cover about 15k, and we have 15k or in savings that we can use. 


We’re looking at two clinics- Oregon Reproductive Medicine and NW Fertility Center. ORM sounds like it’ll be about 24k for a round, whereas NWFC is about 13k. I have heard amazing things about ORM- high rates, lots of great doctors, etc... but they are so much more expensive! NWFC is only one physician, has fewer reviews (although I know a few women who have used his clinic successfully). NWFC is also not a SART clinic, although ORM is. 

Ultimately, I’m not sure what to do. We could potentially fund 2-3 rounds at NWFC, but 2 even two rounds would be challenging at ORM. 

I guess my question is: how much is reputation, having multiple docs on staff, SART status, etc worth?

I've been through 3 years of infertility so far and just found r/infertility and feel like there's finally a safe fertility place for me online. The primal scream threads are glorious.

I (37F) am at a major decision-point in IVF treatment and am hoping others might have insights. 

Quick history: I had 3 miscarriages in 10 months. After that, I was diagnosed with Asherman's and my husband (38M) and I decided to do IVF with ICSI and PGS to reduce the risk of future miscarriage. Fertility testing was mostly normal, with slightly elevated estrogen and slightly underactive thyroid for me, and slightly low morphology for my husband. Karyotyping was normal. We managed to get 4 PGS normal embryos with 2 retrievals in 2019. After 2 failed FETs, we have 2 embryos left and are trying to create more because who knows if that will be enough. 

I've had 2 retrievals this year, and out of 7 total blasts created, 6 have been abnormal and 1 was inconclusive and needs repeat testing. I'm so angry+scared that my rate of normal embryos seems to have fallen off a cliff this year after being fine last year. Has anybody experienced this before and gone on to produce normal embryos again in the future? Assuming we do another retrieval, we're expecting it to be our last one. 

We meet with our RE on Monday for a WTF appointment and I'm working on a list of questions and things to request. After reading through the threads, I'm planning to ask about DHEA and Vitamin D supplements; pICSI/Zymot; redoing baseline testing (May 2019 had FSH 7.0, AMH 1.43, E2 57) + ensuring we do DNA fragmentation on sperm; and moving to an all-menopur stim protocol. Am I missing anything? 

If it's helpful, here are my past protocols (all included CCRM vitamin list):

IVF #1 {35yo at the time}: cetrotide priming; omnitrope; stim with gonal-f and menopur; cetrotide; hcg trigger --> 5 blasts, 3 PGS normal

IVF #2 {36yo}: cetrotide and testosterone priming; omnitrope; letrozole; gonal-f and menopur; cetrotide; cabergoline; hcg + lupron triggers --> 1 blast, 1 PGS normal

IVF #3 {36yo}: testosterone priming; omnitrope; microdose lupron flare; gonal-f and menopur; hcg trigger --> 3 blasts, all abnormal

IVF #4 {36yo}: return to first protocol, but hcg+lupron trigger and cabergoline 1 day before retrieval --> 4 blasts, 3 abnormal (1 inconclusive)",t2_4dtfjglk,False,,0,False,Intro and Sudden decrease in PGS normal embryos,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_hk6jm4,False,dark,0.95,,public,14,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,14,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1593756309.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone, I hope this is appropriate as a standalone post.

Hi all,

Just did my first full IVF cycle and it failed miserably.  I only got 2 eggs (2 empty follicles at retrieval).  I had 4 eggs frozen from a previous cycle.  AMH is down to .25 and my FSH has skyrocketed to 18.  Fertilization with ICSI was good, but we did not make it to blast on day 5.  The rest of the embryos all arrested at day 3.  Any clue what this means?  My RE says she doesn't know why.  I'm guessing it has to do with egg quality?   I was on an extremely high dose of meds (375 gonal/75 menapur/cetrotide starting day 4) stimmed for 8 days before trigger. I've been taking dhea, coq10 and all the supplements I could possibly handle.  I'm 42 and trying to go to a new clinic.  I'm a bit worried about possibly going to CCRM because it's so much money and they only freeze at day 5 blast (at least that's what it seems like)  Anyone know of any clinics of last resort?  I've made an appointment for telehealth at Center for Human reproduction in NYC...",t2_35tqpmei,False,,0,False,What went wrong with this cycle,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_hjwc05,False,dark,0.54,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1593722677.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>&#x200B;</p>

I do not think this should be required but the RN explained that if we skip it I would be going Against Medical Advice since that&#39;s their &quot;standard protocall&quot;. Has anyone had a transfer without a Sonomock?? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.</p>

181,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I am a single, 25 yo female who just visited the RE this morning as per my PA's recommendation. My PA suggested seeing an RE after diagnosing me with PCOS based on elevated DHEAs, slightly elevated FSH, slightly elevated testosterone and high prolactin, the latter of which seems to be inconsistent with PCOS positive patients. Here are my main concerns after my appointment:

1.) At 25 years old, and with no partner in sight, should I be worried about an FSH level of 10.5? I'm set to retest this among other levels on CD3 next month. My RE compared this number to the ovarian reserve number of ""a 38-year-old woman."" This statement forced me to tears in his office. From my own research, this statement has come across as either fairly accurate or dramatic. Other women freak out over 9.6 and their fears are calmed. My RE said 10 is in the ""gray area"" and that over 15 is considered quite bad. I'm aware that one FSH reading should ultimately read into the entire hormone panel workup. I want kids badly, and at the very least I want the choice.

2.) I know at this point I probably have PCOS and endometriosis, and the doctor agrees. However, he doesn't necessarily ""recommend"" surgery, and says that he'll only do it if I want it. He called me a ""thinking woman,"" and said I should really do it because I need an answer. I believe I should do it to establish an official endo diagnosis and reduce pain. He seems to think of it as unnecessarily expensive, since he said if my copay is more than a certain amount I shouldn't do the surgery. Isn't price irrelevant when treatment is being considered?

3.) Levels that are being tested by the RE that haven't been taken before are estradiol, progesterone, AMH. Should I wait to be really worried until I get these results back?

I've never tried to conceive before and said I'd wait until I got married to have sex or become pregnant, so I don't even know if I can. I also didn't vibe well with this RE; he's unbelievably intelligent, but I think there's a lack of personal dynamic. At one point when I was crying he said I was ""going to be fine,"" and then proceeded to say ""you're not dying."" He recommended freezing my eggs, but one of his first questions to me was ""why do you think you have PCOS?""

Does anyone have any advice, especially on the FSH? This number scares me the most.

UPDATE: Thank you to all the women on here for their info; it was badly needed during a time of so much physical and mental distress. I just have a proper set of CD3 labs done; FSH came back as 6.9, LH as 4.7 I believe. So well within the normal range. Don't know why the first set came back so skewed, but I believe the cause to be that my ovulation naturally occurs so soon after the last day of menstruation for me. I'll discuss with my PA at follow-up tomorrow, but I feel better going forward. Will never see that RE again; even if he'd been right about the DOR, I still detest the way he handled my case.

My PA suggested seeing an RE after diagnosing me with PCOS based on elevated DHEAs, slightly elevated FSH, slightly elevated testosterone and high prolactin, the latter of which seems to be inconsistent with PCOS positive patients. Here are my main concerns after my appointment:</p>

<p>1.) At 25 years old, and with no partner in sight, should I be worried about an FSH level of 10.5? I&#39;m set to retest this among other levels on CD3 next month. My RE compared this number to the ovarian reserve number of &quot;a 38-year-old woman.&quot; This statement forced me to tears in his office. From my own research, this statement has come across as either fairly accurate or dramatic. Other women freak out over 9.6 and their fears are calmed. My RE said 10 is in the &quot;gray area&quot; and that over 15 is considered quite bad. I&#39;m aware that one FSH reading should ultimately read into the entire hormone panel workup. I want kids badly, and at the very least I want the choice.</p>

<p>2.) I know at this point I probably have PCOS and endometriosis, and the doctor agrees. However, he doesn&#39;t necessarily &quot;recommend&quot; surgery, and says that he&#39;ll only do it if I want it. He called me a &quot;thinking woman,&quot; and said I should really do it because I need an answer. I believe I should do it to establish an official endo diagnosis and reduce pain. He seems to think of it as unnecessarily expensive, since he said if my copay is more than a certain amount I shouldn&#39;t do the surgery. Isn&#39;t price irrelevant when treatment is being considered?</p>

<p>3.) Levels that are being tested by the RE that haven&#39;t been taken before are estradiol, progesterone, AMH. Should I wait to be really worried until I get these results back?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never tried to conceive before and said I&#39;d wait until I got married to have sex or become pregnant, so I don&#39;t even know if I can. I also didn&#39;t vibe well with this RE; he&#39;s unbelievably intelligent, but I think there&#39;s a lack of personal dynamic.

193,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I like one SIL more than other!

I am super nervous posting this so a throwaway. I have struggled with fertility for the last 3 years officially but been trying for over 7. 

I have known my husband and his family over 15years (were friends before then been together 9 years) my husband is over 10 years older than me meaning one SIL let’s call her A is 8 years older and one SIL say call her B is my age.

SIL A has 3 children I do not mind these children but would not say I had a super close bond (my husband does) this SIL was married over 10 years and marriage fell apart the year we got married (3 years ago) I checked in a lot on SIL A and we became close. Turned out her Ex was pretty emotionally abusive and I even more than my husband became a support to her and help with the kids where can (they live 2 hours away)

SIL B and I as far as I knew have never had an issue. She knew our fertility status and I have made effort. She got married a month after us (this was not an issue) but meant I could not go to her hen do as I was on honeymoon. She didn’t even respond to my bridesmaids about mine but I overlooked it. Although as their mum has dementia and could not go to her hen do I felt bad (my dad died of a brain tumour when a teenager and I know the pain of watching a brain deterioration) I arranged a separate lunch just SIL B, SIL A, MIL and me. I made little party bags etc. 

My wedding was lovely all got on and SIL B’s was lovely month later. 

Last year I finally succumbed and had IVF both SIL knew this, it ended in an early miscarriage SIL A then became my support and again we just get on SIL B said very little. 

My husband had a milestone birthday last year. I struggled all year with my loss but put my heart and soul into that birthday. I had contact with both SIL’s throughout. They were involved with the celebrations.

Long story short SIL B announced her pregnancy the weekend of his birthday. An announcement that came from no where and she had never spoken of children before (just to say most my friends have always given me a heads up might be on the cards due to my situation. It’s not a rule but a nice thing) I am an active ‘Aunty’ to a lot of my friends kids!

Again long story short I went to therapy as I just hated her and felt it was cruel (the way she announced not the pregnancy). SIL A again was a massive support and understood. 

So SIL B had her baby in December due to me recovering from an emotional breakdown not completely because of her but was linked, Covid etc I have never met this baby (I have never stopped my husband was his choice). Through advice from my counsellor I finally took courage to contact her and explain my feelings and TBF she owned it. She was very sorry and knew she made a terrible mistake, she also said she thought I hated her for years (which baffled my husband and SIL A) I have never been mean etc. She did again own this and felt sorry. But by this point I did kinda hate her!

So now I have her trying to be a friend and I still feel kinda crap about her. I have sent the baby clothes and a card etc but I just cannot see myself wanting to be apart of his life but mainly due to his parents. SIL B is trying to be friends but I just can’t feel it, I do understand but she made a shitty decision and thought I hated her for over 10 years and said nothing! I have hung out with his family many many times! Also when even trying to be nice she has an insensitive way of saying things both my husband and SIL A say this.

Another friend has had a baby in this time and I love him. She was so kind and sensitive with her announcement it genuinely became happy news and I love seeing him.

I am travelling to see my friends baby in person for first time this week (they live 2 hrs away) and then SIL A as we genuinely get on. 

I love a good photo and Facebook post and worry SIL B will see and ask why not made that effort for her and her baby. In all honesty I struggle with her not the baby I can’t judge him! I just do not want to see her, I do not mind her but do not want to see her unless a family event. I would not go out my way to see just her (she lives closer than my friend and SIL A)

I just feel well I know she expects us to be a doting uncle and aunt and we are not likely to be and it’s sad really all round. But she never made effort before and thought I hated her for years then through her actions I did! 

My husband is pretty equal with both but tends to see SIL A more, I make plans he is an easy life man but he has struggled with the fertility issues and he did not agree with his sisters decision of how she told us. 

I just feel shitty for this kid, what do I do?

My doctor said i can do the blood work when ever i want but i read that they fluctuate during the day going from high to low? Since i'm working night now i will be doing the test after being up for about 20 hours is that ok? Will it give a accurate result?

I'm (32F) new to the sub, but have been over on TTC30 for a while. We've been trying to conceive actively for 2 years, with a few years of casually preventing before that. I haven't been on hormonal birth control since 2010. 

I have a pretty new DOR diagnosis and am on my first cycle of Clomid (currently cycle day 8, with the Clomid on days 3-7) with IUI planned. My RE says to basically expect IVF after a few rounds of IUI, and implied that the IUI probably wouldn't work. I've been reading through the wiki to learn more about the diagnosis and treatment options, but I'm a bit overwhelmed with everything right now. 

For those who have a DOR diagnosis or otherwise are better informed about it than I am, is  a DOR diagnosis based only on pretty significantly low AMH (.08) meaningful? I have normal FSH and historically low Vit D, though my RE didn't check or ask about that. 

I have an ultrasound planned for CD 12 to determine timing for the trigger and IUI. Should I still be  temping and/or doing OPKs during this time, or are those no longer necessary since I'll be monitored by the RE?  Also, my temp has been higher than normal all cycle so far; does Clomid cause that? Also, I usually ovulate on CD 11 or 12, and my ultrasound to check follicles is on day 12. Does the Clomid delay ovulation, or should I try to get an earlier ultrasound? I know there's some information about changing protocols for those who historically ovulate earlier, and I'm trying to figure out what all may apply to me.

My RE says to basically expect IVF after a few rounds of IUI, and implied that the IUI probably wouldn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve been reading through the wiki to learn more about the diagnosis and treatment options, but I&#39;m a bit overwhelmed with everything right now. </p>

<p>For those who have a DOR diagnosis or otherwise are better informed about it than I am, is  a DOR diagnosis based only on pretty significantly low AMH (.08) meaningful? I have normal FSH and historically low Vit D, though my RE didn&#39;t check or ask about that. </p>

<p>I have an ultrasound planned for CD 12 to determine timing for the trigger and IUI. Should I still be  temping and/or doing OPKs during this time, or are those no longer necessary since I&#39;ll be monitored by the RE?  Also, my temp has been higher than normal all cycle so far; does Clomid cause that? Also, I usually ovulate on CD 11 or 12, and my ultrasound to check follicles is on day 12. Does the Clomid delay ovulation, or should I try to get an earlier ultrasound? I know there&#39;s some information about changing protocols for those who historically ovulate earlier, and I&#39;m trying to figure out what all may apply to me. </p>

<p>I can tell I&#39;m spiraling a bit here, so thanks for any guidance you can give.</p>

I wanted to share a recent study on GH and its effects on patients with poor embryonic development. I am 39, classified as DOR and went through two retrievals in 2019 - first retrieval did not use GH, second retrieval did. I was able to net 1 PGS normal from each round:


1st round: 9 retrieved, 5 mature, 3 fertilized via ICSI, 3 day 5 blasts, 1 PGS normal, mitoscore 18

2nd round: 4 retrieved, 2 mature, 1 fertilized via ICSI, 1 day 6 blast, 1 PGS normal, mitoscore 26.


Needless to say, come retrieval day for round 2 we were not very optimistic, but somehow we were able to walk away with 1 normal. 


Today I stumbled upon a study on IVF patients using GH with promising results. The sample size is small, but I thought it would be helpful for those who are on the 'to GH, or not to GH' fence.

My first major flare up lasted 3 months and was brutal. I wasn't taking NSAIDs at the time because I didn't know what it was at first and I was avoiding anti inflammatories due to trying to conceive. When I realized it was an autoimmune disorder I started Naproxen and within days the inflammation majorly calmed down. I don't yet qualify for biologics, so I'm stuck medicating with anti-inflammatories which are obviously no good for ttc. I basically use the Naproxen for about 5 days after I get my period and then stop. So I am more or less toughing it out and managing with stretching, hot baths, and ice. Some days it's okay, other days it sucks.

Is there anything meds that I can safely take for the inflammation while still ttc? (Not biologics). If I have pain/inflammation but my CRP levels are still normal is that an acceptable level of inflammation for getting pregnant? I know our chance are low with my husband's MFI, but I dont want to have too much inflammation if it does happen. But I also dont want to take nsaids because of the risk. I feel like im stuck between a rock and a hard place.

TLDR: Have an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation. I dont qualify for biologics. Anti inflammatories are a no-no for ttc, and I need strong ones (ibuprofen dont do jack).

(TW: Loss)

I am here looking for some wisdom- advice- stories or anything that can help. 

Basically, we are in our third year of infertility. One early loss in January.  I am 30F and husband is 35M.

**We did all the tests:** so far we have low morphology 2% but RE said it's not an issue since his other numbers are high enough. 

**My tests** were all fine except for having Chronic Endometritis which I am currently treating. 

Also, I don't have the best FSH for my age, but technically it is within range. 

We are starting a natural IVF cycle, and we were advised that it is the best option for us: that if we are not pregnant within a couple of cycles then something is wrong. I should add, I'm an American living in Switzerland and the hospital is a research hospital. The Doctor there- kind of started pushing for natural IVF cycles because they believe some women should not be stimulated if they do not need to be. I like the idea and I am willing to take the low chances..

&#x200B;

**The Questions:** first they are not redoing the Hysteroscopy to check if the Endometritis cleared. She said it is too rare, and another procedure will just put me in the risk of having it again. 

The other thing is: I have really low-grade inflammation that can not be attributed to anything. Done a bunch of tests a couple of years ago. Is this something I should worry about from your experiences- if you have any.

<p>(TW: Loss)</p>

<p>I am here looking for some wisdom- advice- stories or anything that can help. </p>

<p>Basically, we are in our third year of infertility. One early loss in January.  I am 30F and husband is 35M.</p>

<p><strong>We did all the tests:</strong> so far we have low morphology 2% but RE said it&#39;s not an issue since his other numbers are high enough. </p>

<p><strong>My tests</strong> were all fine except for having Chronic Endometritis which I am currently treating. </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t have the best FSH for my age, but technically it is within range. </p>

<p>We are starting a natural IVF cycle, and we were advised that it is the best option for us: that if we are not pregnant within a couple of cycles then something is wrong. I should add, I&#39;m an American living in Switzerland and the hospital is a research hospital. The Doctor there- kind of started pushing for natural IVF cycles because they believe some women should not be stimulated if they do not need to be. I like the idea and I am willing to take the low chances..</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>The Questions:</strong> first they are not redoing the Hysteroscopy to check if the Endometritis cleared. She said it is too rare, and another procedure will just put me in the risk of having it again. </p>

<p>The other thing is: I have really low-grade inflammation that can not be attributed to anything. Done a bunch of tests a couple of years ago. Is this something I should worry about from your experiences- if you have any. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>What would you do?</p>

I've always known I'd struggle to conceive as I was diagnosed with primary amenorrhea when I was about 13.

264,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I hope it’s ok to write a stand alone about this, feel free to let me know if not! So I am on the first day of lining prep for FET 2. We did a freeze all in April because of covid. I was surprised by my clinic’s protocol on freezing/thawing as I have lurked this sub long enough and never read about this method. So I was curious to know if anyone had the same experience with this protocol. So my clinic freezes embryos at day 3 no matter the quality, which I found odd as I mostly see people saying that clinics usually freeze at day 5/6. As a result I had 9 embryos to freeze, which they said will be frozen in 3 groups of 3. And for a transfer they will thaw one group, and see how many survive and grow to blasts, transfer the best and freeze the rest again if there other good blasts left. I wasn’t worrying because I thought out of 3, statistically 1 will make it and the others won’t, but they actually all grew to blasts so they transferred one and froze the 2 others. Now I am getting worried about thawing embryos multiple times and taking the risk to lose embryos or damaging the quality too much. I chose for my first to transfer only one. Now I am worried to “waste” good quality embryos if I don’t use them after the first thaw. Do you know what I mean?

So I am on the first day of lining prep for FET 2. We did a freeze all in April because of covid. I was surprised by my clinic’s protocol on freezing/thawing as I have lurked this sub long enough and never read about this method. So I was curious to know if anyone had the same experience with this protocol. So my clinic freezes embryos at day 3 no matter the quality, which I found odd as I mostly see people saying that clinics usually freeze at day 5/6. As a result I had 9 embryos to freeze, which they said will be frozen in 3 groups of 3. And for a transfer they will thaw one group, and see how many survive and grow to blasts, transfer the best and freeze the rest again if there other good blasts left. I wasn’t worrying because I thought out of 3, statistically 1 will make it and the others won’t, but they actually all grew to blasts so they transferred one and froze the 2 others. Now I am getting worried about thawing embryos multiple times and taking the risk to lose embryos or damaging the quality too much. I chose for my first to transfer only one. Now I am worried to “waste” good quality embryos if I don’t use them after the first thaw. Do you know what I mean? They will work again for FET 2 on a new batch of day 3 embryos, saying that it was better. For the second batch, if more than one make it to blast, should I transfer one or 2?

Hi all,
I am looking for some opinions before I set up a formal WTF call with my RE. I am thinking that we might have to amp up an immune protocol in order for anything to stick. Here is some history:

28F, 28M. Husband is pretty healthy besides some high blood pressure, but I have some medical issues.

* 2009: Dx'd with ulcerative colitis, mild. Has been mostly controlled with medication with the odd mild flare up.

* 2015: Dx'd with endometriosis. I wasn't told which ""stage"" i had, but I did have endo on my bladder, ovaries, etc. Lap in Spring 2015.

* 2016: low-risk pregnancy and live birth (9 cycles TTC).

* 2017: Discontinue birth control pills and begin TTC again.

* 2018: OB ordered pelvic ultrasound and standard bloodwork, did 3 rounds of clomid. Unsuccessful. SA came back exceptional. Referral to RE. Did 1 IUI with Clinic 1. Unsuccessful.

* Winter/early Spring 2019: OB did a lap. Found 4 spots of endo but nothing significant. Did 1 more IUI with Clinic 1. Unsuccessful.

* Spring/Summer 2019: switched to clinic 2. Did 3 more IUIs with max dose of letrozole (6 follicles each time). Unsuccessful.

* Summer/Fall 2019: took break from TTC - NTNP

* January 2020: IVF using Micro-IVF protocol. Great response. 11 follicles retrieved, 6 mature, 6 fertilized with ICSI, 4 made it to blast. Wasn't told grades but told all embryos were of the highest quality and looked great. No PGS/PGD testing. Fresh transfer of 1 embryo resulted in chemical pregnancy - beta was ""1"".

* February - April 2020: on BC pills to manage endo in between transfers at my request.

* May/June 2020: FET with two embryos - protocol included estrace, PIO (started 6 days before transfer), doxycycline (started two days before transfer, continue for 5 days), prednisone (started two days before transfer, continue for 5 days), HCG wash (two days before transfer), lovenox (started day after transfer until beta). 5dp5dt I developed hives out of nowhere, controlled with combo Zyrtec+Allegra. Resulted in CP#2, beta was ""1.7"".

A different doctor than my normal one (its a practice with two REs) called with beta results and said the only thing we could really do next time is a hysteroscopy, which I honestly don't want to do because I don't think it will help.

I'm not sure where to go from here. Immune panel? Intralipid infusions?

I want to set up a WTF call with my normal doc but I don't honestly know what to ask for. It doesn't sound like they have any other ideas for me so I want to come with questions/suggestions myself.

Thank you in advance.

The workup included a FemVue HSG and immediately upon starting the procedure my RE was shocked at the amount of fluid in my uterus.

Once she started she was able to determine it was clear mucus but she showed me on the ultrasound there was a LOT of it.

This cycle my baseline ultrasound at day 3 showed some fluid but they assumed it was blood and that I'd bleed more, I did bleed heavily the rest of that day. Our ultrasound to check follicle development day 11 she was again puzzled, there was less fluid but it was still there. She also had some concerns about the thickness of the lining and instructed me to start Estrace vaginally. They scheduled our insemination for the next day. 

Day of the insemination she noticed the Estrace had actually increased the amount of fluid confirming that it is mucus (and to stop the Estrace) but in general she seems stumped whether it's a factor in our infertility. She did get in a great joke asking the sperm to please not get lost in the swimming pool.

She's having me start progesterone a little early (today, 3 days after insemination as opposed to 7 as they normally recommend) as she believes the only danger the mucus poses is to implantation but I'm not super confident it's not a factor in more ways (and from her general confusion I don't think she's confident in her assessment either).
