I ""joined"" the infertile club at the beginning of last year and have held it together so well, without any real freak outs - but man, am I coming close today. 

Since my husband and  I started with our treatments we have had nothing but insurance troubles.  When we started in about March of last year, our insurance gave us a list of providers we could use and sent us on our merry way. We did two IUI's in June and July of last year and both failed. By August, we were referred to another doctor, in the same hospital network, to get started with IVF. The new doctor's office called our insurance to verify our benefits - and were told that we could have IVF with them, but it would not be a covered benefit. I then made over 5 calls to my insurance company to find out where I could go for IVF. 

It took us from August to December to get in with the new clinic. When we sat down with the RE at the new clinic she told me that I would need to have all of my meds evaluated by Maternal-Fetal prior to moving forward with treatment. I had done this when we first started trying to get pregnant 2 years ago, but complied and made an appointment with both my PCP and the chief of gynecology at a hospital in Boston. I had met with the chief two years ago, so it was pretty easy to get in. I made the appropriate medicine changes and at the middle of January, we met with the RE again. We were finally on our way to an IVF cycle! 

So, of course, the universe tries to spite us with more insurance woes. We would like to cryopreserve my husband's sperm because he is scheduled for shoulder surgery around the same time that I would be going for egg retrieval/implantation. The clinic says it's not a covered benefit, but my insurance says that it is! I have spoken with the insurance department at the clinic and my insurance about 10 times in the past two days. At this point, I am about to pull out my hair. There's nothing more I can do right now, because my insurance is sending out a letter saying that cryopreservation is a covered benefit and I have to wait for that to come in, so I can forward it to the clinic. 

I really wish there was a way to store sperm at home, in like my freezer or something, so that we wouldn't have to go through all of this!

53,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Members,
Recently we've received questions about how /r/infertility fits in with the other, more specific subs available (/r/infertilitybabies, /r/secondaryinfertility, /r/infertilityandfaith, etc). Specifically, people wonder what we “allow” here and what we don’t.

As our sidebar has stated for years, /r/infertility is “here for those dealing with primary or secondary infertility, pregnancy loss, and/or trouble conceiving. This is the place to go when it feels like everyone is pregnant, except you.” Our sub welcomes everyone who is suffering from the effects of infertility, from those of us actively struggling to become mothers and fathers for the first time, to those whose bodies are incapable of biologically procreating regardless of whether they’ve been able to do so in the past. The related subs that cater to a more specific set of circumstances, such as /r/secondaryinfertility, are wonderful resources and we are happy, as mods, to remind new members that they exist, but /r/infertility is a rich sub with a lot of members, a lot of history, and a lot to offer infertility veterans and novices alike. We welcome everyone to join in the discussions here, as well as in the more specific subs.

Part of what makes /r/infertility special is our commitment to supporting each other. This is a refuge from the cruel realities of the real world, where it seems everyone is so fecund they get pregnant from sentimental Super Bowl commercials. In order to achieve this, we need to strive to be sensitive to the feelings of other members. That means that those of us with children need to refrain from casually mentioning parenting and life with kids, but also that those of us still working to become parents need to understand that sometimes a prior successful pregnancy is a necessary detail in one’s fertility history. It also means that while weighty discussions of faith might belong elsewhere, we need to remember that some mentions of faith will be appropriate in this sub. The fact that we now have /r/infertilityandfaith as a resource does not mean that we all must pretend to be atheists while we’re here.

The trouble, of course, is that the difference between a post that is appropriate for our sub and one that is not is often a matter of tone rather than content. Fortunately, we mods are here to sort through the grey areas and offer corrections when necessary. But we can’t do it alone. We need your help. When you see something that bothers you please use the “Report” function. When you report a thread, you anonymously bring it to the attention of the mods. You can even include a 100 character explanation of why you believe the post or comment is unsuitable for our sub. If you don’t feel the need for anonymity, you are encouraged to “message the moderators” using the tiny link in the sidebar, right above the list of mods. We are always open to discussing your concerns about the content of our sub.

Lastly, we’ve gotten some questions about whether we should require post flair for various topics. This isn’t something we’re going to do right now because we feel it probably causes more problems than it solves. Not everyone can actually add flair to their posts, depending on how they use reddit, so it would at best be inconvenient. Furthermore, we feel that members who are unaware that their posts are inconsiderate would be equally unaware of the rule to add flair, so the posts that need it most, likely wouldn’t get it. We feel these new members, and our community in general, are better served by a comment from a mod explaining how we work, than a reprimand for not adding flair to their thread. It is our hope that everyone who needs us can eventually understand how to fit in with the culture here.

Okay, that’s it. Keep on being awesome, everyone!

**tl;dr:** everyone is welcome, but please remember to be considerate of others",t2_6dcf0,False,,0,False,Mod post: Discussion on /r/infertility membership and content,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_2uzhi7,False,dark,0.96,,public,37,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,37,,False,self,1423233961.0,,[],{},,True,,1423261125.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Members,
Recently we&#39;ve received questions about how <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a> fits in with the other, more specific subs available (<a href=""/r/infertilitybabies"">/r/infertilitybabies</a>, <a href=""/r/secondaryinfertility"">/r/secondaryinfertility</a>, <a href=""/r/infertilityandfaith"">/r/infertilityandfaith</a>, etc). Specifically, people wonder what we “allow” here and what we don’t.</p>

<p>As our sidebar has stated for years, <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a> is “here for those dealing with primary or secondary infertility, pregnancy loss, and/or trouble conceiving. This is the place to go when it feels like everyone is pregnant, except you.” Our sub welcomes everyone who is suffering from the effects of infertility, from those of us actively struggling to become mothers and fathers for the first time, to those whose bodies are incapable of biologically procreating regardless of whether they’ve been able to do so in the past. The related subs that cater to a more specific set of circumstances, such as <a href=""/r/secondaryinfertility"">/r/secondaryinfertility</a>, are wonderful resources and we are happy, as mods, to remind new members that they exist, but <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a> is a rich sub with a lot of members, a lot of history, and a lot to offer infertility veterans and novices alike. We welcome everyone to join in the discussions here, as well as in the more specific subs.</p>

<p>Part of what makes <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a> special is our commitment to supporting each other. This is a refuge from the cruel realities of the real world, where it seems everyone is so fecund they get pregnant from sentimental Super Bowl commercials. In order to achieve this, we need to strive to be sensitive to the feelings of other members. That means that those of us with children need to refrain from casually mentioning parenting and life with kids, but also that those of us still working to become parents need to understand that sometimes a prior successful pregnancy is a necessary detail in one’s fertility history. It also means that while weighty discussions of faith might belong elsewhere, we need to remember that some mentions of faith will be appropriate in this sub. The fact that we now have <a href=""/r/infertilityandfaith"">/r/infertilityandfaith</a> as a resource does not mean that we all must pretend to be atheists while we’re here.</p>

<p>The trouble, of course, is that the difference between a post that is appropriate for our sub and one that is not is often a matter of tone rather than content. Fortunately, we mods are here to sort through the grey areas and offer corrections when necessary. But we can’t do it alone. We need your help. When you see something that bothers you please use the “Report” function. When you report a thread, you anonymously bring it to the attention of the mods. You can even include a 100 character explanation of why you believe the post or comment is unsuitable for our sub. If you don’t feel the need for anonymity, you are encouraged to “message the moderators” using the tiny link in the sidebar, right above the list of mods. We are always open to discussing your concerns about the content of our sub.</p>

<p>Lastly, we’ve gotten some questions about whether we should require post flair for various topics. This isn’t something we’re going to do right now because we feel it probably causes more problems than it solves. Not everyone can actually add flair to their posts, depending on how they use reddit, so it would at best be inconvenient. Furthermore, we feel that members who are unaware that their posts are inconsiderate would be equally unaware of the rule to add flair, so the posts that need it most, likely wouldn’t get it. We feel these new members, and our community in general, are better served by a comment from a mod explaining how we work, than a reprimand for not adding flair to their thread. It is our hope that everyone who needs us can eventually understand how to fit in with the culture here.</p>

<p>That said, we have activated the option to add flair to threads, so you are welcome to do so if you wish. If you would like us to add more flair topics, just let us know.</p>

<p>Okay, that’s it. Keep on being awesome, everyone!</p>

I've started reading some online blogs about the process and what to expect, and I've got a couple of books on the way from amazon. It's come to my attention that I will be taking a LOT of time off of work, (For some reason I had it in my head it would all be very wham bam thank you ma'am. I feel so naïve.) which my boss is thankfully fine with. We are, however, a very small office, and my coworkers will undoubtedly be picking up my slack.

We're all pretty close and keeping the IVF a secret is just... not likely to work. I can't think of a single lie where I don't come off as lazy or dying of cancer or something. The woman I work with the most, Beth, is very right winged, evangelical Christian. My faith & belief system is very different from hers, but we manage to get along and have fun working together anyways. The trouble is Beth can be very judgmental. She has flat out said that she finds fertility treatments completely disgusting and people who can't get pregnant naturally should get over themselves and adopt. Her words, not mine. It came up back when there was that big surrogacy controversy in the news, she has no idea my husband and I are struggling with this. We continue to get along because I simply refuse to engage in politics or religion with her.

Now a normal person would then be embarrassed and put their foot in their mouth when hearing a coworker is going through fertility treatments. Based on past behavior I think she is more likely to judge me harshly, blurt out something cruel and talk about how immoral I am behind my back. I don't think she understands the effect her words can have on people, she just never learned how to say things nicely or be sensitive to the feelings of others. I'm nervous this could get nasty.

I guess what I'm hoping is that someone will have some thoughts on how to approach this with her? I feel like I need to set boundaries with her and make myself clear that her opinion is not wanted or even appropriate. How, though? I need to be blunt and tactful because once she starts blurting I don't think I'll be able to rise above that shit. It will be too personal. This is all hard enough without judgment and I'm feeling really protective of myself.

There isn't anyone else in the office that worries me really, I just don't want extra stress added to the shit I'll already be going through. I feel bad enough knowing I'll miss so much work, but I don't want to cause a rift in our friendly happy work environment.

I'm 22 years old and on July 19, 2014 I gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Days after leaving the hospital I knew something was wrong with me. I was admitted to the hospital after some time in the ER and to make a long story short, before I knew it I was given a ""choice"": have a hysterectomy or you will die. Not much of a choice is it? So at 21 I had a hysterectomy.

My biggest fear has always been to not be able to have children. I'm so so grateful that I got to have one. I know there are women who would give anything to be able to have one baby. I feel so selfish for feeling this way, but it feels like a piece of me died that day. I could go on and on about all the things that hurt about it but I'm sure you can more than relate. I try to be grateful for what I have and I love my son more than anything, but it hurts. It hurts so bad. I mourn the children I will never have. I dreamed of a big family and I will never have it. It kills me. 

I feel like I don't belong anywhere. I feel like I can't complain because at least I had one baby. I feel like I don't fit in with infertility groups because there's no ""keep trying"" or ""it could happen"". There is no hope. There is just 100% NO. All the online support groups I've found seem to be for childless women. I feel like I'm in a strange situation and there is no place for me. And I can't reiterate enough how much I really feel as if I have no business complaining or being upset when I do in fact have a healthy baby boy. I also feel as though I'm sometimes ridiculous because I would NEVER think those things about another woman in my shoes, but I can't give myself the same without feeling awful.

I truly hope I didn't upset anyone. If I did I am SO sorry. I just am hurting so much and I don't know where to turn. Reddit has always been so kind and amazing for the most part, and I'm hoping it will be the same here. I just don't know what to do or where to go and I need someone to talk to. I need to feel as though I'm not alone because I feel vastly isolated. No one I know can relate to me at all. I feel so lost.

I'm waiting for an appointment with my fertility doc (10 days from now) about next steps... until then, I'm perhaps futilely trying to wrap my head around what the options may be.  

Here's the quick history.  I'm 37. Trying for number one. I have diminished ovarian reserve.  I have always had irregular periods, although typically with very short cycles. When I started tracking with OPKs, I was surging anywhere from day 6-16, though usually very early, luteal phase was fairly consistent though.

I don't recall/have all of my numbers, but when we started this in September, my FSH was a bit high, AMH low, and my antral follicle count was a remarkably shitty 3.  Not 3 each side, but 3 in total.  

Sono showed clear tubes. My husband had a couple of sperm tests, all pretty good, slightly low motility but nothing serious. A couple of luckily-timed ultrasounds while we were monitoring showed a reasonable-sized follicle each time.

I have some subclinical thyroid issues that my regular doc has been trying to perfect once she learned we were trying... I've been 'normal' this whole time, she's just trying to get it into 'perfect for pregnancy'.

Fertility doc recommended at least 3 rounds of IUI plus fertility meds. Did Clomid+IUI. Naturally ovulated super early--LH surge showed up on the blood test they took just to monitor. Follicle was about 20mm.  Didn't work, but I did get long (21 days) luteal phase.

Next was supposed to be Femara+IUI but I again naturally surged on the day they did the follow up blood test, (19mm follicle) but that landed on Christmas so no IUI. Did a trigger shot to ensure that I ovulated.  Ended up with a 34 day luteal phase, and when they investigated why it was taking so damn long, they found a couple of cysts that ruptured.

Starting to conclude that in my body, the medication is shit. I get one follicle with medication and one follicle without medication sow what is this giving me except a mindfuck when my cycle goes weird? But, I figured I'd carry on with the medication if for no other reason than to create a convincing case that in my body, medication is shit. 

Next cycle was supposed to be the same, but after the baseline Day 3 blood test/ultrasound they told me not to take Femara.... my FSH had suddenly surged to over 50.  

Apparently, what I do now is wait to talk to the doctor about what we do from here. Fuck.

Everything I can google about FSH over 50 talks about motherfucking menopause.  

Everything I can google about a low antral follicle count says ""poor candidate for IVF."" Fuck.

I can't find anything about anyone who had a massive, sudden spike in FSH anything like mine, nor anyone who had my practically non-existant antral follicle count like mine. No one can tell me anything about what that might be. Is this a blip and we give IUI another couple of chances? Is this an indictor that we move to IVF?  Is this the beginning of the end of the road? Are there other options?

We're in Canada, so almost all the testing/monitoring is covered.  Medication is not although we have some supplemental insurance that has so far covered Clomid/Femara. IUI is not, but we could afford a few months of that without concern. IVF is not (don't know if we'll have coverage on any of the medications) so if I am a poor candidate that may not be money worth spending. I don't know. How do you even make that decision?

I'm very sick of people trying to reassure me. Most of those people don't know shit from shit. (I have a friend who is like ""Every step is getting closer.""  Really? Closer to what?)  I don't need reassurance. I need reality. Hope is not something I can do anything about.

<p>I have some subclinical thyroid issues that my regular doc has been trying to perfect once she learned we were trying... I&#39;ve been &#39;normal&#39; this whole time, she&#39;s just trying to get it into &#39;perfect for pregnancy&#39;.</p>

<p>Fertility doc recommended at least 3 rounds of IUI plus fertility meds. Did Clomid+IUI. Naturally ovulated super early--LH surge showed up on the blood test they took just to monitor. Follicle was about 20mm.  Didn&#39;t work, but I did get long (21 days) luteal phase.</p>

<p>Next was supposed to be Femara+IUI but I again naturally surged on the day they did the follow up blood test, (19mm follicle) but that landed on Christmas so no IUI. Did a trigger shot to ensure that I ovulated.  Ended up with a 34 day luteal phase, and when they investigated why it was taking so damn long, they found a couple of cysts that ruptured.</p>

<p>Starting to conclude that in my body, the medication is shit. I get one follicle with medication and one follicle without medication sow what is this giving me except a mindfuck when my cycle goes weird? But, I figured I&#39;d carry on with the medication if for no other reason than to create a convincing case that in my body, medication is shit. </p>

<p>Next cycle was supposed to be the same, but after the baseline Day 3 blood test/ultrasound they told me not to take Femara.... my FSH had suddenly surged to over 50.  </p>

<p>Apparently, what I do now is wait to talk to the doctor about what we do from here. Fuck.</p>

<p>Everything I can google about FSH over 50 talks about motherfucking menopause.  </p>

<p>Everything I can google about a low antral follicle count says &quot;poor candidate for IVF.&quot; Fuck.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find anything about anyone who had a massive, sudden spike in FSH anything like mine, nor anyone who had my practically non-existant antral follicle count like mine. No one can tell me anything about what that might be. Is this a blip and we give IUI another couple of chances? Is this an indictor that we move to IVF?  Is this the beginning of the end of the road? Are there other options?</p>

<p>We&#39;re in Canada, so almost all the testing/monitoring is covered.  Medication is not although we have some supplemental insurance that has so far covered Clomid/Femara. IUI is not, but we could afford a few months of that without concern. IVF is not (don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll have coverage on any of the medications) so if I am a poor candidate that may not be money worth spending. I don&#39;t know. How do you even make that decision?</p>

<p>I&#39;m very sick of people trying to reassure me. Most of those people don&#39;t know shit from shit. (I have a friend who is like &quot;Every step is getting closer.&quot;  Really? Closer to what?)  I don&#39;t need reassurance. I need reality. Hope is not something I can do anything about.</p>

<p>(I am apparently in a crappy frame of mind. This FSH over 50 is-this-motherfucking-menopause bullshit just happened.) </p>

We are 34(M) and 33(F) and she has been on 7.5 Femara/progesterone treatments for 5 cycles. Male factor is good and RE says IUI won't greatly increase our chances. We are getting mature follicles, sometimes on both ovaries, but as of yet, nothing doing. Our RE suggested at our last appt that we start to consider moving right to IVF. 

So, it begins. We have been discussing IVF for the last several days and I think we are both OK with the decision to pursue it. Our concerns are what people generally fret about; cost/ failure, multiple births (we'd take it!), invasive procedure, etc... 
We are also concerned that it might be too early to consider it, and that our doctor is pushing us to it.

In January, I was told *""okay, your body is not ready for the embryos, let's freeze them and do a frozen transfer, so that's about five weeks.""*

I'm here to join your club. I am fairly new to Reddit although I have been lurking on and off for the past couple of years. It just recently occurred to me that there would be a bunch of infertility Reddits so here I am. Didn't feel like I could respond to any thread before I introduced myself. So here is my infertility journey in a nutshell:

- I am female, 29, Canadian (BC). My husband is 29, almost 30. 
- we have been trying since 2012 and were diagnosed with severe MFI in 2013. 
- I also have slightly elevated FSH (at the top range of normal). Also just found out I have cervical stenosis.
- We tried one IUI despite having only a 5% chance realistically and it of course failed. 
- August of 2014 was our first IVF cycle (IVF being our only real chance of conceiving). We had about 23 eggs which resulted in 6 embryos. We froze all because I displayed many OHSS symptoms. 
- October 2014 we did a FET and transferred one embryo. It was a success.... For one incredibly happy week. I had a miscarriage and lost the baby naturally at the hospital. 
- we will be doing another FET for my feb/March cycle. Likely still trying with one embryo as implantation was successful last time. This time I also get my cervix dilated because of the stenosis. That will be done on February 11th. If anyone has had this done I would appreciate hearing your story. 

That's about it. I have recently been struggling with a feeling of making no progress on this infertility business and it's been pretty consuming and made me feel like a failure in this and other areas of my life. I think this is partially because of the long wait between FETs. That is mainly due to the fact that my clinic closed for a whole month over Christmas (goodness knows they needed this). Also feeling panicky because I feel like I will end up in the group who has been through numerous IVFs and FETs and the hope is low... I'm so sorry for all those who are in that boat. So these two reasons are why I have sought out more support. Oh and the fact that my sister and two cousins are all having babies in April. They all started trying after us. I will need a lot of support in April if our next FET doesn't work. 

I'm looking forward to getting to know you guys but of course hope you won't be on this board long either.

That my husband and I are dealing with infertility after being soooo careful not to &quot;accidently get pregnant.&quot; That I spend all day with 24 children, some of which I Iook at and think &quot;wow, I would love to have a kid like you&quot; or &quot;I bet our son would have hair and eyes like his.&quot; I want to laugh at everyone who says &quot;oh it&#39;ll happen, stop worrying, you&#39;ll be fine! I know what it&#39;s like to have a hard time getting pregnant , just put your legs in the air.&quot; (That last ones true, I was told that. Yah.)</p>

<p>Oh man, life is just one big fuckin ridiculous joke. Ha. </p>

Have just kind of been going through the motions of life as IUI after IUI failed and test after test yielded no diagnosis but I thought today I'd just get some things out. Today is my 30th birthday. I think every birthday sucks nowadays and I'm sure you all go through the same emotions I've had lately. I always imagined what I'd accomplish by the time I was 30, and having a child always seemed like a simple one. Jokes on me!

The good: My whole immediate family came up to visit (3.5 hour drive) yesterday and it was so nice to see them and spend some time with them. My parents gave me a pretty substantial check and I was just shocked. With tears in her eyes, my mom said I only turn 30 once, but we all knew this was to help with IVF. I said I could turn 30 again next year if it meant more of that haha. My sister bought me this movie I watched a lot as a kid, Heart and Souls, since neither of our significant others have seen it. It was so sweet. My husband comforted me when I was a crying mess. He brought me the most beautiful bouquet of flowers I've ever gotten and took me out today to get this ring I've had my eye on at Kay that was too expensive in my mind to buy considering what we're saving for. But he said he's using his bonus and it's something to make me happy and give me strength through all the shots which I'm dreading the most. Everyone was really loving and supportive so that was really nice.

The bad: I've been having like mini breakdowns on and off. I felt so guilty taking any money from my family and getting this ring from my husband. I'm overwhelmed by sadness that I've hit this milestone and don't have the one thing I wanted by now. I started to feel regret at living in CT. I never intended it to be forever and always imagined moving back by my parents but now that doesn't seem likely. I feel like I'm missing out on so much with my family and I don't want to regret it when they're gone. This was all brought about by the fact that my husband's uncle/godfather just passed away suddenly at 46 and we're all trying to deal with the loss. It felt strange to have his family wishing me happy birthday when that doesn't really matter with what they're going through. Someone mentioned to me ""well, you don't understand. You'll understand when you have children."" Thanks for that reminder, but I let it go this time. And bad luck seems to follow me everywhere. We had to wait over an hour for a table when we went out to dinner with my family (making them very late driving home) and had to sit by the door so were freezing anytime anyone came or left. Figures.

So it's been a day of ups and downs, a rollercoaster of emotions. I wish I could just start the IVF process now and not wait another month and a half. Waiting to find out exactly how expensive these meds will be so that can improve or crush my mood. Fingers crossed.

It’s a picture of my brother with my mom on her 32nd birthday. “32,” carefully pasted on her gift, in yarn, no less. Along side, the word, “Mom,” also decorated the package.

I vividly remember, with the assistance of my aunt Ruth, carefully constructing the gift inside. It was a homemade apron that, funnily enough, my mom never ever wore. Not once. It was constructed of fabric in shades of white, and that oh-so-popular “country blue” color that graced all of our mothers' kitchens in the 1980s. The apron included a frilly country lace edging, and country blue pockets in the shape of hearts. Of course. 

I also remember wrapping the apron, and my brother and I gingerly pasting yarn to the front of the package, leaving no question as to for whom the gift was intended and for what occasion. “Mom. 32.”

Spoiler alert: My mother loved it, wouldn’t you know. 

These memories of my mother’s 32nd birthday, have somehow, without my conscious awareness, become a benchmark for my own timeline for motherhood. 

I guess I have always envisioned my children doing something similar for me, on my 32nd birthday. When my 32nd  birthday came and went a year ago, I thought to myself, reassuringly, “At least… I’m sure… I’ll be on the path to motherhood this year.”

The benchmark has passed. No children. No sign of children.

Of course, we remain hopeful for children during this, my 33rd year.  

But for now, today is a day on which I can’t help but mourn the loss of my long-held idea; that I would some day be a 32 year old mother.

So... I'm figuring out that the PA who sent me for CD21 is pretty uneducated, to start. Apparently CD21 progesterone is only for women who have a 28-day cycle. My cycle is more like 32-34 days, so I should have it done around CD25. That's great. However, to add to the confusion, my chart this month is an utter mess, and FF has no idea when/if/how I've ovulated. I'm either 8-9dpo, or 1-2dpo. Here's a link to my chart, just to make your brain hurt:


http://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/57707b

The PA who ordered this, is the same PA who had NEVER heard of Vitex (she pronounced it ""vit-REX"" our entire appointment, and I had to explain to her what it does), and also told me that lack of EWCM has no bearing on fertility. AND, she was going to have my FSH done on CD21. I took it upon myself to educate myself about the bloodwork I'm having done,  and learned it has to be done on CD3, so I took it upon myself to reschedule and show up at the lab accordingly. Lastly, when I explained that I get deep stabbing pains on my right side from Ovulation to AF each month, which has occurred since having my cyst removed on that side in 7/14, she told me condescendingly ""that's called ovulation pain."" Really? The same side every month, coinciding with a surgery to that ovary? And lasting for 2 weeks? You is so smart. So, I don't have much confidence in her.

Anyway, my progesterone today was 8.6. Our lab's reference range is 5-23 for the mid-luteal phase. Everything I've read says that anything under 10 is cause for concern, yet they have it allowable as normal all the way down to 5?? Like I said, I'm not sure if I'm 8-9dpo or 1-2dpo, but from what I've read about the reference ranges, it is low according to anything but this particular lab's range.

Just looking for some reassurance that this is an OK level, and my doctor isn't as incompetent as I'm beginning to think she is. I truly have the feeling that I'm going to walk in, and she's going to say that since I have any progesterone, it means I've ovulated, and not to worry. I'm considering calling to schedule with someone else, the more I review the things she told me that I absolutely know are incorrect.

Living with infertility. 

When you go to Target, and you see all those cute baby outfits and the furniture? You redirect your attention to kitchen decor.

You walk down an aisle, and there’s a dad playing with his two daughters while mom shops. You imagine your husband doing that before you focus your attention on accent rugs. 

Next, you’re confronted with six pregnant women as you walk across the store for cheese and candy because fuck healthy eating, it hasn’t helped you so far. You imagine what that must feel like, having a life growing within you. You shut those thoughts down because it hurts so goddamn much. 

As you’re walking to the register, you encountered three sets of twins and you wonder if that will be you because you have to do fertility treatments for any hope. But then you remember, those haven’t worked for you, either. 
Finally, FINALLY, you make it to the register…and the cashier and lady in front of you know each other. Oh, look at that, they’re talking about how the lady can’t get pregnant again. “It’ll happen when it will!” Oh. Now let’s talk about how amazing it felt in the delivery room after you each held your children. Really? Is this SERIOUSLY happening to me? Yes. Yes, it’s real. So at this point, you’re trying so hard not to cry because hello, crazy. You will the cashier to shove everything in the bags so you can sit in your car and just curse fate for being so fucking cruel. 

That isn’t even a day with infertility. That’s an hour. Constant redirecting of thoughts, ignoring anything baby around you, just trying so hard to forget the one things that is unforgettable.

I'm in the process of changing REs so I decided to get a couple second opinions.  I've done 4 cycles of femara, 2 monitored with trigger shots.

RE 1.) Belives my eggs aren't getting mature and we have mild MFI.  Recommends IVF.

RE 2.) Believes my eggs aren't getting mature, sperm is fine.  Recommends injectable cycle with TI.

RE 3.) Diagnosed mild MFI.  Recommends clomid/IUI.

I have one more opinion coming tomorrow.  I'm a little dizzy with the varying opinions!  IVF, TI, and IUI have all been suggested!  I guess what I'm wondering is, does the doctor even matter?  Is it just the treatment I should worry about?  I mean, if I do a medicated IUI, does it matter who does it?  Are there factors I should be concerned about other than the diagnosis and treatment?  

How did you pick a clinic/doctor?

That has a lot to do with the fact that when I first joined this sub I got to know a lot of the regular users. I followed their stories, I felt their pain with them, their exciment, and I hoped with them each month. And I'm so happy to say that almost every single one of them has moved on to r/infertilitybabies. Which is wonderful!! However, it has actually made this a place that makes me feel incredibly sad now. Another place for me to look around and think ""Wow, everyone else can do it, why can't I?"" And I know it's full of new, supportive members, but that doesn't stop me from getting upset. And I really hate that because this used to be one of my biggest support systems. Now I tend to avoid it more often then not and end up with no one to talk to. 

This last year has been one of the hardest for me because we got stuck in a never ending loop with a doctor who apparently only wanted to see us to get our money. She never did any treatments with us, just sent us away each time telling me to lose more weight. For a whole year. While making me take birth control to force a regular period. I had two pill options for my BC. One made me feel sick, the other absolutely killed my sex drive, so that was fun. I did manage to lose 35lbs and 2 pants sizes, learn tennis, run 2 miles without stopping, and made dead lifts my bitch, so this year did make me healthier. However, it wasn't enough weight for my RE (absolutely no treatment until I'd lost 50lbs), which made me sad, which made me eat, which stopped my progress. Luckily, we have switched to a new RE who is very pro-treatment. He's ready to get started whenever we are. 

But we can't start now because we have to save up first. Of course our insurance doesn't cover shit when it comes to IF, so it's all out of pocket. And since our old RE always said we'd start with monitered clomid and timed sex, we didn't expect our first few cycles to be a huge expense, however, our new RE wants to go straight to IUI since the unmonitered clomid and timed sex didn't work for us in the past. So even though we've progressed, it doesn't feel like we have. And in retrospect, we obviously should've been saving for this the entire year we were with the old RE, but we were being optimistic and putting our money towards getting other bills paid off instead.

I'm not even sure what the purpose of this post is. I guess I'm just a little depressed and desperate to get all of this off my chest. I don't have anyone in my real life I can talk to about this because no one understands, and when I come here I get even sadder because all the old members have moved on without me.

I know we all shout at newcomers to get to an RE, the only reason I hadn't yet was because an RE I had a freebie 10 minute consult with agreed that I needed to have the fibroid taken out, so I was waiting for that surgery before proceeding. 

Still, I am disappointed in my Gyno. I had my follow-up appointment last week and he never asked me (or my husband) what we thought, what we wanted to do, etc. He just kept saying to wait 6 months, try naturally for 6 months, and then see him if I am not pregnant by the end of the year. FUCK THAT SHIT! This has been 2 years now, and I do have the luteal phase defect/weak ovulation which is why I was on femara, so how does he expect that to be cured from the fibroid surgery??

My insurance MIGHT cover testing at the new clinic if he would refer me but he won't because he thinks we need to try naturally again. No, just no. We planned financially as though insurance wouldn't cover it anyways. 

So we have an appointment at OHSU in Oregon in March for an evaluation/consultation. I feel like I'm at such a weird place because my OBGYN did SOME tests (HSG, thyroid, AMH, sperm analysis for the husband), did some super basic IUIs (meaning NO ultrasound monitoring), and then the fibroid surgery. No other hormonal testing was done even though I asked for it, he said they only do it in women over 35 (I am 30, will be 31 in March). 

So I have no idea what testing they will want to do or what treatment they will recommend. I guess I wouldn't be surprised if they wanted to do more aggressive IUIs (since the RE I had the free quickie consultation with said that is what they would do to be aggressive before fibroids tried to come back), but when I read about the success stats I just feel depressed.

I know we all shout at newcomers to get to an RE, the only reason I hadn&#39;t yet was because an RE I had a freebie 10 minute consult with agreed that I needed to have the fibroid taken out, so I was waiting for that surgery before proceeding. </p>

<p>Still, I am disappointed in my Gyno. I had my follow-up appointment last week and he never asked me (or my husband) what we thought, what we wanted to do, etc. He just kept saying to wait 6 months, try naturally for 6 months, and then see him if I am not pregnant by the end of the year. FUCK THAT SHIT! This has been 2 years now, and I do have the luteal phase defect/weak ovulation which is why I was on femara, so how does he expect that to be cured from the fibroid surgery??</p>

<p>My insurance MIGHT cover testing at the new clinic if he would refer me but he won&#39;t because he thinks we need to try naturally again. No, just no. We planned financially as though insurance wouldn&#39;t cover it anyways. </p>

<p>So we have an appointment at OHSU in Oregon in March for an evaluation/consultation. I feel like I&#39;m at such a weird place because my OBGYN did SOME tests (HSG, thyroid, AMH, sperm analysis for the husband), did some super basic IUIs (meaning NO ultrasound monitoring), and then the fibroid surgery. No other hormonal testing was done even though I asked for it, he said they only do it in women over 35 (I am 30, will be 31 in March). </p>

<p>So I have no idea what testing they will want to do or what treatment they will recommend. I guess I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they wanted to do more aggressive IUIs (since the RE I had the free quickie consultation with said that is what they would do to be aggressive before fibroids tried to come back), but when I read about the success stats I just feel depressed. We have already been at this for 2 years. I&#39;m tired of waiting and feeling stuck in limbo. </p>

<p>So, any opinions on treatments? tests needed? </p>

Each time they made notes and said 'next time we'll do X or Y, or we'll start Z sooner'. Unsurprisingly, we failed, as I was shown on Christmas Day by a lovely present from my uterus. Merry Christmas to me, yes?

Since we were out of town for the first few days of my cycle, we opted to take the month off as there really was no way that I could get started on the right track. It was a nice month, with me losing 6 pounds so far on my new diet.  Today is a ""lovely"" Day 1, and the sort of Day 1 that starts off with a sudden blurt and not my typical spotting for a day or two.

I feel like I just can't do it this month again.  I'm telling myself all sorts of logical reasons for that, from the fact that I am going to Las Vegas for a girl's weekend at the end of February, to the fact that I've started losing weight and feel like giving that a bit more time will improve my odds exponentially even by giving it one more month.  And to the fact that with the Vegas trip, and uncertainty about taxes this year that won't be settled until Mid-March when some other forms come from employment - I really don't know if I want to spend the money on things.  We can ""afford"" it, but it's a case of wanting to save the money instead just in case taxes nail us and I go too wild in Vegas.

All that said, I'm worried that I'm wanting to take this month off instead because I just can't handle failing again so soon after last time.  We've been working at things and suffering setbacks and complications for over 3 years now. Hell, probably close to 5 at this point.  It took us this long to get to IUI and I think I was just too hopeful for that procedure and getting my period on Christmas day absolutely gutted me.

Is it so wrong to take a month off from fear of disappointment and worry that I just can't handle another setback so soon? Am I just fooling myself to think this will ever be easier?  We've drawn a line in the sand, for ourselves, that we likely won't go to the IVF stage of attempts.  It's too expensive and we personally don't feel like we're strong enough to handle that stress.  So we're basically giving IUI our all and then if after 3 or so attempts (however many the doctor wants to try, I guess) we're just.. throwing in the towel.

Am I just a huge wimp for wanting another month off to get myself ready for what is closing in on our last attempts?

I've been lurking a long time, but finally decided to join in on the conversation. A little background on me:
29 years old (30th birthday very close.. which you know what that means: more friends getting pregnant by the day and more depression!). My husband and I have been trying for 14 months. Not even a hint of a positive during that time. 

To keep things short, I've had ovulation/irregular issues.. went to acupuncture to fix it awhile ago and seemed to do the trick. Cycles are now pretty ""normal"", though I suspect something else could be going on (always have had some pelvic pain, etc, getting everything tested...). 

Finally convinced husband to go for semen analysis back in December and our worlds were crushed. His count was 6 million, 0% progressive motility and morphology couldn't even be counted. He then went to a urologist who was an ass and said he had ""small, soft balls."" He had all the tests done (still don't have all the answers yet...but ultrasound and blood work came back fine) and a second analysis which came back WORSE. 4 million this time and abnormal viscosity.

He has been sick with a fever 3 times in the past month, so I don't know if that has impacted it... but needless to say, he has tried to change his lifestyle. Minimal/no drinking, exercise, vitamins, etc. None of the doctors seem to think ANY of this will change it.

We had our first R.E. appointment a few weeks ago and her answer was pretty straightforward: due to his severely low counts, IVF is really our only option. She went through all the details of it, is making me go through some tests this month, etc.
Given my type A personality, I want to get started NOW. I'm tired of waiting and we've already wasted so much time. I would be lying if I said I wasn't a tiny bit resentful that my husband refused to test his sperm for a year. My husband, on the other hand, while he accepts that this is probably our fate, wants to wait it out. He still thinks we can ""beat the odds"" and wants to try naturally for another 3-6 months. He doesn't want to put ourselves through so much physical, emotional and financial pain if we don't need to.

I think he's in denial and is just putting it off. I guess my question is -- am I rushing into IVF? I want a family, I want biological children, and if his count is that low, what other option do we have?

I'm in the last few weeks of prepping for IVF at a new RE, and she tested my AMH. It came back *really high*.

Age: 36

FSH: 4.0 (tested multiple times over the last few years)

AMH: 11

PCOS status: I have some but not all of the classic PCOS symptoms. In fact, I have not, to my knowledge, ever actually had cysts on my ovaries! But I have long (35+ day), often anovulatory cycles, insulin resistance and a big fat ass, difficulty losing weight even with a high caloric deficit, and a couple chin hairs. 

My googling this morning leads to believe that an AMH in the range of 1.7ish is normal for my age, and anything from there up to 4 is pretty good. That makes 11 seem.... really high. And I've learned its correlated with PCOS. I see studies showing ""high AMH"" has positive predictive value for IVF-- that women with AMHs in that 1 - 4 range have a higher response to the stimulation phase, making more eggs, and thereby netting themselves a better chance at making a good embryo and getting pregnant.

Well, last year I did IVF and had 11 eggs retrieved. That's not a terrible response, at all, but its not crazy high. And I actually had my stims raised from (IIRC) 100 units of Follistim at the outset to 150 units and adding 75 units of Menopur before completing 12 days of stimming.

She and her husband are sort of in a way, me and my husband's spiritual mentors. My husband and I are Christians have been struggling a lot lately. At least I know I have been. 

This friend also struggled with infertility and after 3 years of trying she and her husband stopped trying and never conceived their own child. Yet their faith grew stronger and stronger. They have also fostered and adopted 12 children. So as can be imagined, she is the one always helping me come back to my faith when I am angry with God and frustrated and not understanding why this is happening to me. Even though I know talking about her infertility brings up the emotions and pain all over again, she still willingly talks to me and calms me down. 

I know there are people who are not believers in this subreddit, and I promise I'm not trying to preach to you. I just wanted to share these verses shared with me, as it has uplifted me and has made me feel so much better in the past few days. 

She has shared with me, a verse that is helping me. It is in Psalms 113:9 ""He (being God) settles the childless woman in her home, as a happy mother of children""

This verse has given me hope and light when I was in a crazy dark place before. Almost completely hopeless and angry. This brought me back and has been making me feel so much better.

She also shared with me, some insight from the Bible and one way the Bible views infertility. Proverbs 30:16 

“There are three things that are never satisfied,
    four that never say, ‘Enough!’:
    the grave, the barren womb,
    land, which is never satisfied with water,
    and fire, which never says, ‘Enough!’

Infertility is compared to fire, a desert that never has enough water, and the grave. Our desires to become parents are so extraordinary that it is compared to a blazing fire, a dry desert, and death. This helped me to realize that unless someone has gone through what you have gone through, they won't understand how you're feeling. Infertility isn't compared to other people's struggles but rather the earth's phenomenon that ""never say, enough"". We just keep on going. Even when we really don't want to keep going, there's something within us pushing us to keep trying, just one more time.

203,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello,
This is an x-post from r/Parenting.  Someone suggested that I post here as well -- note that I'm not sure if i'm fertile/infertile or not, hope that doesn't break any rules.  Anyway, here goes...

My wife and I are having trouble conceiving and, although we're very happy with each other otherwise, our lack of success is taking a toll on us. My specific issue is that the process has given me a bit of an anxiety, at least around the time that my wife is ovulating. I never really realized that women were only really fertile for 2-3 days per month, and worrying about the need to perform during that small window makes me so anxious that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and I actually cannot get in the mood. (Yup, I get so anxious I can't have sex. Embarrassing.)

I think I might feel better hearing some of your experiences and thoughts on the situation.  Basically, anything along these lines below (which, sadly, I assume pertains to everyone on this subreddit)

* Experienced depression, anxiety, or anything else from the process of trying to conceive and/or had trouble conceiving.
* Any negative feelings that result from ""forced"" or ""scheduled"" sex when trying to conceive.

More info/background: I'm a 32 year old man who has been married for 4 years. About 7-8 months ago, my wife and I decided we were ready to start a family. I had NO idea how complicated and stressful that could be. Obviously this was naive, but I didn't know much about female ovulation/menstruation, other than that one dreaded week of the month. When I found out that there was pretty much a two-three day window to conceive within a given month combined with my very busy work schedule and my wife's Type A personality I began to get very stressed.

The anticipation waiting for that monthly ""sweet spot"" builds up and, to be completely honest, a lot of times I get so anxious that by the time it comes I am not up for sex. The ""scheduling"" of things seems very unnatural and makes it really hard for me to get in the mood.
I unfortunately now know when ovulation will occur based on my wife's period begin/end dates. She's successfully hid it from me on a few occasions which was really helpful, but that's usually not possible since we obviously live together.

I'm sure people will say ""get help""... I did go to a counselor of sorts this fall and while it felt good to talk to someone, it didn't really help. Granted, they didn't necessarily specialize in this kind of topic and also were more of the social worker variety than a true psychiatrist. Perhaps the latter would actually be able to help?  I am hesitant because it is a TON of money and the outcome is uncertain...

Final notes that might be helpful for context: 
* We normally have sex 2-3 times per week, but usually on the weekends when we aren't busy or stressed from work.  This has been a pattern for years, so I guess we should have foreseen that random tuesday night sex was going to be a bit of a change.

* The frustrating thing is we tend to have a lot of sex before and after my wife ovulates when I feel ""normal""

* We both work long days in corporate jobs that are generally a bit draining. We're not unhappy at work, but tired by the time we get home at 8pm each day.

* Anxiety medicine apparently isn't a good idea since one of the side effects is lack of sex drive.

* In retrospect, I wish we were the couple that just stopped using birth control but never ""scheduled"" when they wanted to conceive... too late, though.

I feel completely ridiculous posting all this, but I'm hoping your thoughts and experiences might make me feel better. I know there are a lot of people out there who've experienced similar stress and/or actual fertility issues.  My wife doesn't know that I'm posting this, but I'm going to show her your replies and I think it will help make her feel a bit better too.

<p>The anticipation waiting for that monthly &quot;sweet spot&quot; builds up and, to be completely honest, a lot of times I get so anxious that by the time it comes I am not up for sex. The &quot;scheduling&quot; of things seems very unnatural and makes it really hard for me to get in the mood.
I unfortunately now know when ovulation will occur based on my wife&#39;s period begin/end dates. She&#39;s successfully hid it from me on a few occasions which was really helpful, but that&#39;s usually not possible since we obviously live together.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure people will say &quot;get help&quot;... I did go to a counselor of sorts this fall and while it felt good to talk to someone, it didn&#39;t really help. Granted, they didn&#39;t necessarily specialize in this kind of topic and also were more of the social worker variety than a true psychiatrist. Perhaps the latter would actually be able to help?  I am hesitant because it is a TON of money and the outcome is uncertain...</p>

<p>Final notes that might be helpful for context: 
* We normally have sex 2-3 times per week, but usually on the weekends when we aren&#39;t busy or stressed from work.  This has been a pattern for years, so I guess we should have foreseen that random tuesday night sex was going to be a bit of a change.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The frustrating thing is we tend to have a lot of sex before and after my wife ovulates when I feel &quot;normal&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>We both work long days in corporate jobs that are generally a bit draining. We&#39;re not unhappy at work, but tired by the time we get home at 8pm each day.</p></li>
<li><p>Anxiety medicine apparently isn&#39;t a good idea since one of the side effects is lack of sex drive.</p></li>
<li><p>In retrospect, I wish we were the couple that just stopped using birth control but never &quot;scheduled&quot; when they wanted to conceive... too late, though.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I feel completely ridiculous posting all this, but I&#39;m hoping your thoughts and experiences might make me feel better. I know there are a lot of people out there who&#39;ve experienced similar stress and/or actual fertility issues.  My wife doesn&#39;t know that I&#39;m posting this, but I&#39;m going to show her your replies and I think it will help make her feel a bit better too.  </p>

<p>Again, apologies if this post is misplaced as I am pretty much new to Reddit.  Thank you all in advance for your thoughts.  </p>

Anyway, so, I have PCOS. I have been breastfeeding for 15 months, and I stayed off birth control because...well, honestly? I don't want anymore hormones in me after going through a shit ton of infertility treatments. I wanted to see how my body would do on its own, after everyone and their moms told me that having a baby tends to ""cure"" infertility. 

My naive, stupid self thought that my cycles would return, and they'd be normal. That I'd ovulate on day 14 and all that stupid crap. Nope. My first postpartum period came when my son was 13 months old. It was light and lasted four days. My second one came 48 days after that. A long cycle, but not the longest I've had. I chalked it up to still breastfeeding. 

My third one? Oh, let me tell you about this crap. My third one came TEN DAYS after my second one ended. I bled for 12 days, 6 of those days being so heavy that I almost had to go to the ER (I was told to go, but I didn't). Because I was sure I had no more blood left to bleed, I dragged myself to the OBGYN. 

I have an ultrasound on Monday to check to see if everything is okay, but what really had me down was the fact that she wants me to go back on birth control so I can control the cycles and the bleeding.

She had decided she wanted me to come in rather than just talk over the phone.  I had my husband come with me (which I think was a good call if only because he got to meet the doctor).

She went over all of the issues I have had this cycle while being on Clomid, and how I responded to the Clomid in previous cycles, and agreed that we would not do any Clomid going forward.  We also started talking about plans for future cycles - she gave me the option between Femara and Gonal-F, but said given that I have over-responded on very low Clomid doses overstimulation would be more of a concern with Gonal-F, and there would have to be more extensive ultrasound monitoring (aka, missing more work).  My husband and I agreed Femara would be the preference, but we'll consider injectibles if I have bad side effects on Femara.

The other thing she wanted to talk to me about was the hair loss, and my overall stress levels.  A lot of ""well, there's a lot we don't know about infertility, but lowering stress is never a bad idea"" and she suggested taking some cycles off.  My husband agreed that taking a break would likely cause me MORE stress and anxiety than it would alleviate, and helped me advocate for moving forward, even though he agreed with the doctor that I need to figure out some ways to reduce my overall stress.

The first one, tonight, was not bad. I imagine they'll get worse over time, but here is what we did.

1. Warmed up the substance till it was thinner and more liquid. (Lowered the vial for about 10 minutes in very warm water, then repeated it since it cooled down by the time we did the shot.)
2. I heated the area with an electric pad for about 5 minutes first.
I didn't ice the area beforehand. (Read pros and cons of ice first, but I thought the warmed, relaxed muscle was the way I wanted to start out. I'll change if pain gets worse and report back.)
3. We used a 25 gauge needle.
4. I leaned on the leg that wasn't getting the shot.
5. My husband took about 20 seconds to slowly press in the liquid. For the first minute I didn't feel a thing. In the second minute I felt ""something,"" but it wasn't stinging or pain. For today, just a sort of dull pressure/awareness.
6. He put hot water in a ziplock baggie and that was my warm compress. We alternated pressing down the baggie with massaging the area for maybe 10 minutes.

90 minutes later, it feels normal.

Other info: My dose is 2 ccs, and this progesterone comes in sesame oil. I've read that it's both worse and better than other kinds. Can't compare, since this is my first shot.

Sending wishes of strength to anyone who's faced with this treatment. I'm sorry we need to go through this. 

I'll report back as the days go by, if it gets worse, I get any side effects, or we change our technique.

**Edited to say 20 seconds, not 2 min, per info from my husband. (Sure felt like longer than a few seconds!)

UPDATE on day 6 of shots: so far nothing more than minor pain. Minor = one quick sting when needle went in and, once, a weird ""awareness of unnormal pressure/intrusion"" feeling in second half of oil being pushed in. But, so far, no agony or bruises or bumps. Sitting on the heat pad now. Really hoping this lasts! (And needs to last!!!)

UPDATE on day 14 of shots: So far, I've felt intense pain once, during a shot. The best way I can describe it is a hook moving around in there -- something unnatural and sort of disgusting and painful. I did cry. We have never used ice, and we continue to use a lot of heat and massage. Yesterday (day 13) for the first time, my hips hurt outside the shots, when I was walking -- felt like I'd been on a hike the day before. That night, the shot was painless. Will continue updates if I have any other useful info.

The takeaway, so far: the shots themselves have only been truly painful once. And, after 2 weeks, soreness is starting to settle in. Overall, I have to say they were less bad than I was fearing. Obviously unpleasant, but not nightly agony. Hoping others facing PIO have a similar experience, and it's not worse. Hugs to all. ",t2_iibv6,False,,0,False,First PIO done.

I watched the video on <a href=""http://www.freedommedteach.com/eng/"">http://www.freedommedteach.com/eng/</a> and still couldn&#39;t get the air out completely. </p>

My husband and I decided before we were married that we would go through our first year without getting pregnant.  We would take all precautions necessary.  I even had one friend say ""You're going to be on birth control *and* make him wear a condom, aren't you?""  Well, honey, yes.  If that's what it takes.  We are part of a religion that marries pretty young and starts popping out kids fairly quickly.  Getting married in our late 20s is not the norm.  We didn't live together first so we just wanted the first year to be us.  In September 2012 we decided to pull the goalie.  Boy, were we excited...and so naive.  By February 2013, I knew something was wrong.  I had tried tracking temps, ovulation kits, everything I could think of.  I had so many people tell me that we needed to keep trying.  The likelihood of getting pregnant within 2 years was slim.  I'm so glad I didn't listen.  A dear friend gave me the name of her OBGYN.  I made an appointment and saw him in March.  I explained to him the situation and he started me on Clomid starting in April.  It was awful.  The worst emotional roller coaster I could have imagined.  I went the three rounds, increasing dosage each cycle.  By July, my new OBGYN retired and I was assigned another.  He wanted me to go one more round and the same dosage as the third.  I was reluctant, but did it anyway.  Waste of time and money.  No dice.

I was referred to an RE.  We started the blood tests and the ultrasounds and even started seeing a nutritionist.  Husband had a semen analysis and everything looked good.  I had an HSG scheduled the beginning of September.  As some of you ladies know, quite an awful experience.  Now, although the tech can clearly see what's going on, they wouldn't tell me anything.  My RE had to go over the results.  The timing was horrible.  We couldn't get our schedules right and it was an entire month before I could get back in.  Unfortunately it was a day my husband was at work.  So here I was, by myself for yet another appointment, as my RE told me what the problem was.  Too many cysts and fluid-filled tubes.  Tubes are basically withered on the ends and not functioning the way they should.  My only option is IVF.  Further, he was worried that because of the fluid building up, there was fear that it would reflux into my uterus, destroying my uterine lining and decreasing the chance of successful implantation.  He suggested doing a tubal removal.  My ovaries and eggs looked good and uterus looked normal for now.  I could play the chance game or I could move forward with the simple 2 hour laparoscopic surgery.  

We met again with my OBGYN for the surgery in January 2014.  I had a trip planned for Guatemala in February, so we planned the surgery for later in March.  We did our research and felt that removing my tubes would be the best chance at preserving my uterus for future IVF.  At the time, we didn't have plans in the immediate future for IVF.  We actually had already started going the adoption route.  At this point, we were in the middle of completing classes for our home study.  But we knew at one point, we'd want to try IVF.  So the end of March comes around and my surgery was not a success.  What was supposed to be 2 hours turned into about 5 1/2.  I had so much scar tissue built up from having my appendix removed when I was younger that they couldn't even see through the first scope.  They cut me open.  My doc started to remove parts of one tube and the blood began to flow.  It took 4 trauma surgeons and my doctor to get the bleeding under control long enough to close me up.  Surgery failed.  The recovery was **awful**.  I really wish I had known about this sub then, because I really needed it.  My most depressive period in my life.  I was on short term disability for 6 weeks and hated about 95% of it.  I hated the whole process and wanted to give up.

May 2014 I went back to work.  Life went back to normal, but I was still on my ""I don't care about kids at all"" road, which of course, not true.  We ended up diving head first into our adoption plan.  We had an amazing case worker and by September, everything was turned in and we waited for our home study to be approved.  We got approved in October and our profile went live in November.  By December it was like my uterus was screaming at me.  I was ready for IVF.  As much as it scared the ever living crap out of me, we needed a baby.  And we were ready to do whatever it took to get one.

Now...for today.  It was the first time seeing my RE since that awful day in October 2013.  I was so excited.  On pins and needles.  My mom and I even planned a trip to Texas in April to seem my sister.  (Flights were **super** cheap today!)  We get into the office and I give him the run down of the last year.  Then he gets into the nitty-gritty.  He starts pulling out charts of ideal weights for IVF...and I'm not near it.  Let me back up a little.  After my surgery, during my depressive stage, I decided I needed to get healthier.  I am 5' 4"".  At the time of my surgery, I was 265 lbs.  My highest weight.  Ever.  Not exactly a goal I had aspired to, obviously.  It just happened.  I got lazy and I really like food.  No excuses.  My weight contributed to some of my surgery complication.  Not a good thing.  So in May, I decided I would get healthier for me.  No fad crash diets, no working out like mad and hating it.  I would make better and healthier food choices and do my best to work out 3-5 times a week.  Most importantly, I wouldn't guilt myself for missing a work out or enjoying some ice cream from time to time.  By October, I was down 30 lbs.  Over the holidays, I put about 8 lbs back on.  Now, here I am, sitting in the office and all I can think of is how it took me 7 months to lose 30 lbs, and I still need to lose 30 more to be at an ideal weight for IVF.  What a crushing blow.  It took everything I had to hold back the tears that were about to overflow.  

I realize that there are so many worse things that I could experience right now.  I realize that 30 lbs may not seem like a big struggle.  But 30 lbs means more waiting.  More waiting for something that I, we, want **so damn bad**.  And that's before we can even start the process.  Any of it.  More waiting.  Now I'm worried that I'll completely stress myself out because 30 lb could mean no baby for awhile.  I don't even know how to process it all right now.  I kept thinking, ""Do I need to get a second opinion?""  I mean, I know the risks pregnancy and obesity, but there are *plenty* of much heavier women getting pregnant naturally and having healthy pregnancies and babies.  So why am I so freaking special?

Right now, I'm so angry.  I feel hopeless.  I cried as soon as we got into the elevator.  I cried myself to sleep on the highway.  I cried at dinner in Outback.  I did make it to my water aerobics class and I cried the entire way there.  Big, ugly sobs.  And I just still want to cry.  Haven't I given enough yet?  Haven't I wanted it bad enough yet?  Haven't we all?  I try to think about those that have been waiting longer and have been through so much more, but this already hurts so bad.  I can't imagine it hurting so much worse.  I'm just at a loss.  All I want to do is dive into a bowl of ice cream, but in the back of my mind I keep thinking *it will push you farther from getting that baby*.  It's just not fair.  And I'm so over all of it.

The likelihood of getting pregnant within 2 years was slim.  I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t listen.  A dear friend gave me the name of her OBGYN.  I made an appointment and saw him in March.  I explained to him the situation and he started me on Clomid starting in April.  It was awful.  The worst emotional roller coaster I could have imagined.  I went the three rounds, increasing dosage each cycle.  By July, my new OBGYN retired and I was assigned another.  He wanted me to go one more round and the same dosage as the third.  I was reluctant, but did it anyway.  Waste of time and money.  No dice.</p>

<p>I was referred to an RE.  We started the blood tests and the ultrasounds and even started seeing a nutritionist.  Husband had a semen analysis and everything looked good.  I had an HSG scheduled the beginning of September.  As some of you ladies know, quite an awful experience.  Now, although the tech can clearly see what&#39;s going on, they wouldn&#39;t tell me anything.  My RE had to go over the results.  The timing was horrible.  We couldn&#39;t get our schedules right and it was an entire month before I could get back in.  Unfortunately it was a day my husband was at work.  So here I was, by myself for yet another appointment, as my RE told me what the problem was.  Too many cysts and fluid-filled tubes.  Tubes are basically withered on the ends and not functioning the way they should.  My only option is IVF.  Further, he was worried that because of the fluid building up, there was fear that it would reflux into my uterus, destroying my uterine lining and decreasing the chance of successful implantation.  He suggested doing a tubal removal.  My ovaries and eggs looked good and uterus looked normal for now.  I could play the chance game or I could move forward with the simple 2 hour laparoscopic surgery.  </p>

<p>We met again with my OBGYN for the surgery in January 2014.  I had a trip planned for Guatemala in February, so we planned the surgery for later in March.  We did our research and felt that removing my tubes would be the best chance at preserving my uterus for future IVF.  At the time, we didn&#39;t have plans in the immediate future for IVF.  We actually had already started going the adoption route.  At this point, we were in the middle of completing classes for our home study.  But we knew at one point, we&#39;d want to try IVF.  So the end of March comes around and my surgery was not a success.  What was supposed to be 2 hours turned into about 5 1/2.  I had so much scar tissue built up from having my appendix removed when I was younger that they couldn&#39;t even see through the first scope.  They cut me open.  My doc started to remove parts of one tube and the blood began to flow.  It took 4 trauma surgeons and my doctor to get the bleeding under control long enough to close me up.  Surgery failed.  The recovery was <strong>awful</strong>.  I really wish I had known about this sub then, because I really needed it.  My most depressive period in my life.  I was on short term disability for 6 weeks and hated about 95% of it.  I hated the whole process and wanted to give up.</p>

<p>May 2014 I went back to work.  Life went back to normal, but I was still on my &quot;I don&#39;t care about kids at all&quot; road, which of course, not true.  We ended up diving head first into our adoption plan.  We had an amazing case worker and by September, everything was turned in and we waited for our home study to be approved.  We got approved in October and our profile went live in November.  By December it was like my uterus was screaming at me.  I was ready for IVF.  As much as it scared the ever living crap out of me, we needed a baby.  And we were ready to do whatever it took to get one.</p>

<p>Now...for today.  It was the first time seeing my RE since that awful day in October 2013.  I was so excited.  On pins and needles.  My mom and I even planned a trip to Texas in April to seem my sister.  (Flights were <strong>super</strong> cheap today!)  We get into the office and I give him the run down of the last year.  Then he gets into the nitty-gritty.  He starts pulling out charts of ideal weights for IVF...and I&#39;m not near it.  Let me back up a little.  After my surgery, during my depressive stage, I decided I needed to get healthier.  I am 5&#39; 4&quot;.  At the time of my surgery, I was 265 lbs.  My highest weight.  Ever.  Not exactly a goal I had aspired to, obviously.  It just happened.  I got lazy and I really like food.  No excuses.  My weight contributed to some of my surgery complication.  Not a good thing.  So in May, I decided I would get healthier for me.  No fad crash diets, no working out like mad and hating it.  I would make better and healthier food choices and do my best to work out 3-5 times a week.  Most importantly, I wouldn&#39;t guilt myself for missing a work out or enjoying some ice cream from time to time.  By October, I was down 30 lbs.  Over the holidays, I put about 8 lbs back on.  Now, here I am, sitting in the office and all I can think of is how it took me 7 months to lose 30 lbs, and I still need to lose 30 more to be at an ideal weight for IVF.  What a crushing blow.  It took everything I had to hold back the tears that were about to overflow.  </p>

<p>I realize that there are so many worse things that I could experience right now.  I realize that 30 lbs may not seem like a big struggle.  But 30 lbs means more waiting.  More waiting for something that I, we, want <strong>so damn bad</strong>.  And that&#39;s before we can even start the process.  Any of it.  More waiting.  Now I&#39;m worried that I&#39;ll completely stress myself out because 30 lb could mean no baby for awhile.  I don&#39;t even know how to process it all right now.  I kept thinking, &quot;Do I need to get a second opinion?&quot;  I mean, I know the risks pregnancy and obesity, but there are <em>plenty</em> of much heavier women getting pregnant naturally and having healthy pregnancies and babies.  So why am I so freaking special?</p>

<p>Right now, I&#39;m so angry.  I feel hopeless.  I cried as soon as we got into the elevator.  I cried myself to sleep on the highway.  I cried at dinner in Outback.  I did make it to my water aerobics class and I cried the entire way there.  Big, ugly sobs.  And I just still want to cry.  Haven&#39;t I given enough yet?  Haven&#39;t I wanted it bad enough yet?  Haven&#39;t we all?  I try to think about those that have been waiting longer and have been through so much more, but this already hurts so bad.  I can&#39;t imagine it hurting so much worse.  I&#39;m just at a loss.  All I want to do is dive into a bowl of ice cream, but in the back of my mind I keep thinking <em>it will push you farther from getting that baby</em>.  It&#39;s just not fair.  And I&#39;m so over all of it.  </p>
