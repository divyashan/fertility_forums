  Tonight is the first time I'll be doing the injections. I was taught how by nurses- so that's not the big worry, it's more of the possible mood swings and bloating, etc. I'm doing this as a single woman, 37 going on 38.  Preserving my eggs for 5 years. Just began seeing a guy, it's only been a month, and of course I'm not telling him right now.  I'm afraid of becoming over-sensitive over silly things in the next 10 days and scaring/pushing him or others away. 

&#x200B;

The good thing about doing it right now is that I'm currently working from home with a flexible schedule, so I don't have to worry about the side effects affecting me at an office during 9-5 or whatever. 

&#x200B;

My retrieval will be probably in 10-ish days. Worried about so much. Don't know who will be able to pick me up because literally the closest people to me will be out of the country or out of town for work- no exaggeration. This is a personal and private procedure that I don't feel comfortable telling everyone about, so I'm reluctant to tell acquaintances or others not as close to me (they'd be picking me up from a fertility clinic).

&#x200B;

It's been a real whirlwind ending up here. I'm 30, gay, and have always always wanted to be pregnant. Knowing it wasn't going to happen accidentally for me and being the planner I am, I got everything in place through my 20s. My wife and I got married last year and decided 2019 was the year we were going to put our plans into action.

Then I tested positive for Huntington's disease. Luckily (although literally nothing feels lucky right now) I'm on the low end of positive, so I likely have at least 15-20 years before I start getting sick, and will likely have between 5-10 ""good"" sick years after that. I'm absolutely destroyed at this news and feel like I'm grieving so much of what I thought my life would be. I have an incredible support network and am involved in research, and I have a fab therapist who I've know since long before this news. I'm doing as well as can be expected considering.

I'm in a soup of anxiety and doubt right now, mostly related to pregnancy.  I'd always felt that as long as I can carry a pregnancy I'd be fine, it didn't need to be my genes, especially since my wife also has a uterus and eggs. After getting my diagnosis and knowing I won't live to be an old person I feel this intense and inexplicable desire to pass on my good genes and have a biogenetic child. Either way, for me to conceive we have to go through IVF. I have no insurance coverage, but my genetics group is covering PGD/PGS and I'm so thankful for that. If they weren't we'd probably be moving forward with reciprocal, as the bill is already fucking insane without the added PGD piece. I'm a good saver and we're above water financially, but this definitely makes it harder to feel financially safe.

My wife is anxious that if we struggle to conceive with IVF that the stress will be too much for me and put me over the edge. I hear that concern, but also want as many healthy years as possible with any kids we are able to have. Right now our compromise is we're going to move forward with everything up until the FET and reassess how our emotions are at that point/decide whether we need to wait a few months to get ourselves right. The idea of waiting more terrifies me and my guess is we'll end up moving forward when our non-affected embryos (assuming we have some... good god) are ready.

No particular question to ask. Just looking for solidarity as I stare into the maw of my own death while trying to create a new person. Life is a wild and changeable thing.

The results of a randomized controlled trial looking at whether physiological ICSI (pICSI) results in a higher live birth rate than traditional ICSI were just published in the Lancet (one of the top medical journals in the world). The authors do not find that pICSI resulted in a significantly higher live birth rate and thus do not recommend it as standard practice. The only outcome that was significantly different between the 2 groups was a lower miscarriage rate in the pICSI group, but they didn't have a large enough sample size to draw strong conclusions about this difference. 

PubMed open access version here: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618329891?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618329891?via%3Dihub)

(if this doesn't work, let me know - I'm at work at a university so hard to tell what is open access)

A few notes from my quick read:

\- This looks very sound methodologically and has a nice sample size (I'm an epidemiologist but don't do work related to infertility). The study was double-blinded and they used a stratified randomization process, which makes sure the 2 groups are balanced on things like maternal and paternal age, RPL, and ovarian reserve. 

\- You might note that although the difference was not statistically significant once other confounding factors were controlled for, there was a 12% higher live birth rate in the pICSI group.

\- The sample excludes women with DOR (I think, I'm too lazy to convert AMH>1.5 pmol), couples who did an IVF/ICSI split, or anyone using donor eggs or sperm.

I'm having a hysteroscopy next Wednesday to correct a uterine subseptum, and then hopefully start an fet cycle in March. one doctor in my practice said why do the hysteroscopy before knowing our test results in case we have nothing to transfer, but he didn't tell me that till my preop, after we had been told our schedule multiple times and had this procedure scheduled for 2 months because it takes forever for a surgery spot to open up. but that's another discussion, my procedure is next week and the doctor that sees me most often supports the decision 
what I came here to talk about is my in laws. they're coming Tuesday, initially they were coming Thursday to visit because they have a long weekend, but with my hysteroscopy wednesday they decided to come Tuesday to help. which is nice, but I'm dreading it. as soon as we told them about my husbands Mfi and our plans to do IVF with pgs/pgd testing, they haven't known how to respond. my husband is very open about it, which is fine it's our information to tell. but my mother in law has said multiple times we shouldn't tell anyone not even extended family, she was weird that I even told my parents because she thought they'd be mad at him or blame him or think I should get divorced. which is so insulting that she would tell me she thought that about my parents. And a couple times shes said that we probably shouldn't have told them about it, just tell them when were pregnant. and that was so hurtful because my husband talks to people and his parents in particular about this stuff because he needs support, and they're basically saying they dont want the burden of this difficult time in our lives. I got really insulted, and I stopped giving them so many updates about our treatments because they told us it should be private. and my mom is happy to talk things through with me, shes very supportive, and I dont feel like sharing this with people that act like my problems are a burden to them.

I&#39;m having a hysteroscopy next Wednesday to correct a uterine subseptum, and then hopefully start an fet cycle in March. one doctor in my practice said why do the hysteroscopy before knowing our test results in case we have nothing to transfer, but he didn&#39;t tell me that till my preop, after we had been told our schedule multiple times and had this procedure scheduled for 2 months because it takes forever for a surgery spot to open up. but that&#39;s another discussion, my procedure is next week and the doctor that sees me most often supports the decision 
what I came here to talk about is my in laws. they&#39;re coming Tuesday, initially they were coming Thursday to visit because they have a long weekend, but with my hysteroscopy wednesday they decided to come Tuesday to help. which is nice, but I&#39;m dreading it. as soon as we told them about my husbands Mfi and our plans to do IVF with pgs/pgd testing, they haven&#39;t known how to respond. my husband is very open about it, which is fine it&#39;s our information to tell. but my mother in law has said multiple times we shouldn&#39;t tell anyone not even extended family, she was weird that I even told my parents because she thought they&#39;d be mad at him or blame him or think I should get divorced. which is so insulting that she would tell me she thought that about my parents. And a couple times shes said that we probably shouldn&#39;t have told them about it, just tell them when were pregnant. and that was so hurtful because my husband talks to people and his parents in particular about this stuff because he needs support, and they&#39;re basically saying they dont want the burden of this difficult time in our lives. I got really insulted, and I stopped giving them so many updates about our treatments because they told us it should be private. and my mom is happy to talk things through with me, shes very supportive, and I dont feel like sharing this with people that act like my problems are a burden to them.

48,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi r/infertility,
   I’ve been here for awhile now and this sub has been so amazing.  I am wondering if any of you have a similar situation or can help me understand our results we got today.  Backstory- I got pregnant with twins from an IUI with injectables in October and miscarried both of them at 8 weeks.  Got genetic testing done and found that at least one of them had a 4q deletion that was “large” and in people with this area of the 4th chromosome missing they can have a variety of problems- mental retaliation, facial malformations, short stature, heart problems etc.  and the embryos were missing so much that they thought it could be the cause of miscarriage.  Ok great- we have a cause.  So my husband and I do FISH testing to make sure neither of us has a translocation or is a carrier.   We get the results today- my husband has a 4q deletion and the missing part was not found anywhere else- it’s just a deletion not a translocation.  The genetic counselors told my RE they were shocked my husband is normal.  He is super smart, average height, handsome, literally nothing wrong with him.  His biological dad was a super weird dude though and some people thought he was MR or on the spectrum but my husband was adopted so we don’t know a whole lot.   RE says 50% of our embryos will have a 4q deletion but since my husband is normal they don’t know if it will or will not cause significant problems but with the size of the deletion they’re surprised it didn’t.  So..we can do IVF with genetic testing or just take our chances that the HALF of all possible pregnancies will have that genetic problem with unknown results.

   I’ve been here for awhile now and this sub has been so amazing.  I am wondering if any of you have a similar situation or can help me understand our results we got today.  Backstory- I got pregnant with twins from an IUI with injectables in October and miscarried both of them at 8 weeks.  Got genetic testing done and found that at least one of them had a 4q deletion that was “large” and in people with this area of the 4th chromosome missing they can have a variety of problems- mental retaliation, facial malformations, short stature, heart problems etc.  and the embryos were missing so much that they thought it could be the cause of miscarriage.  Ok great- we have a cause.  So my husband and I do FISH testing to make sure neither of us has a translocation or is a carrier.   We get the results today- my husband has a 4q deletion and the missing part was not found anywhere else- it’s just a deletion not a translocation.  The genetic counselors told my RE they were shocked my husband is normal.  He is super smart, average height, handsome, literally nothing wrong with him.  His biological dad was a super weird dude though and some people thought he was MR or on the spectrum but my husband was adopted so we don’t know a whole lot.   RE says 50% of our embryos will have a 4q deletion but since my husband is normal they don’t know if it will or will not cause significant problems but with the size of the deletion they’re surprised it didn’t.  So..we can do IVF with genetic testing or just take our chances that the HALF of all possible pregnancies will have that genetic problem with unknown results.  Can anyone help me understand how he has this with no abnormalities that we know of?  What would you do in this situation? Has anyone heard of this before? </p>

Hello,

My husband and I have been TTC for four years. We are finally starting IVF treatment on February 11th and am exceptionally nervous.

My heart is absolutely in bits because last weekend my youngest brother came home to tell us that he and his girlfriend of 5 months are three months pregnant. This is unexpected but they are delighted and planning to make it work.

So much is making me sad- how can there be an accidental pregnancy when in the same family, I am desperate for a child? I can't believe that my parent's first grandchild won't be mine. I feel like a terrible big sister as I don't know how to support him or be excited for him when I feel so jealous and broken and hurt. I love him but can't believe a child is being born to such a new couple when we are still waiting and praying.

Their 12 week scan is on the day we start our base line scan, the irony. Managing stress during IVF process has become much much harder. I dread the insensitive comments from extended family about my little brother beating me to it and I am so frightened of a failure for our treatment while looking at their growing bump and excitement.

Of all the many lows, and difficult pregnancy announcements since we starting trying, this is breaking my heart.

&#x200B;

I'm 18dpiui #2, with no period and a negative beta yesterday. My only HPT was 13dpiui on an internet cheapie, and of course that was negative too. I posted here last month because I was concerned about the length of my luteal phase with such a long cycle, but folks told me that fertility drugs could lengthen my luteal phase so I chilled and then started spotting 16dpiui #1. But here we are two days later with no signs of a period at all. Both my cycles have been medicated with 150mg Clomid CD 5-9, and Ovidrel trigger shot. First cycle I triggered on Day 13, had two follicles at 20.1 and 21.1. 2nd cycle I had an ultrasound on Day 13, follicles weren't big enough yet so I had a 2nd on Day 15, where I had one at 18 and 1 at 15, so we triggered and I did IUI on Day 16. My RE has also been doing IUI \~24-25 hours post trigger, whereas I've read most people do closer to the 36 hour window, even if you want sperm waiting for the egg? I mentioned it to the NP at my REs office the last time, and she was like ""well sperm lives three days!"" which is I know is NOT the case for frozen donor sperm. I've heard 24 hours max, more likely 12. She seemed completely disinterested in my question about pushing the IUI out to 30+ hour post-trigger.

&#x200B;

Given my extended luteal phase, I'm just not sure I'm ovulating in the window at all. I'm temping, but I do shift work and sleep like trash, so I feel like my temping is not particularly reliable. I broached this to the NP at my REs office after my negative beta yesterday, and her response was that next time they could draw progesterone one week into my two week wait to confirm ovulation, and then if I hadn't then next time, IUI #4, do a double trigger. That's fine, but I'm interested in seeing if there's anything I can do to gather information/improve timing BEFORE I drop another $2k on this project. I'm single, I'm a social worker, I have no financial support from anyone and no insurance coverage, so every dollar matters, as I'm sure it does to everyone on this sub, no matter your situation.

&#x200B;

Background- I'm 34 (until next month), TTC Solo with frozen donor sperm. My AMH is low (.374), but I ovulate regularly on my own (or I did until I started this process), and I've always had very regular periods. HSG showed clear tubes, but I had a hysteroscopy in July to remove an endometrial polyp, and a laparoscopy in November to remove ovarian cysts which popped up after my first post-hysteroscopy cycle and wouldn't leave. First IUI was December. FSH was high normal (9.9), and per my RE he's not worried about egg quality yet, given I'm 34. I do have hypothyroidism, which has been controlled with Levothyroxine for almost 4 years, and all my recent thyroid labs have come back normal. I don't think I've been tested for thyroid antibodies, though. I take a handful of supplements every day- prenatal, CoQ10, Zinc, Omegas, Vitamin D, B-Complex. Also an SSRI which I don't intend to stop.

&#x200B;

I realize IUIs have a low individual success rate, and that I'm only two in. We might be doing everything right and it just hasn't worked, or it may never work. But I can't help but feel like some things need to be tweaked. 

&#x200B;

So here are my ""What Would You Do"" questions...

1) Would you switch donors after two failed IUIs? I like my donor, but this is the easiest ""switch"" to make to change things up. I've been using California Cryo, and I know there are cheaper banks out there, too.

2) What about pre-trigger lab monitoring, in addition to the ultrasounds? I know some people do this. Can anyone tell me more? I'm wondering if my body wants to ovulate later, and we are trying unsuccessfully to ovulate an immature egg, or if we are ovulating an immature egg, and my luteal phase length is due to something else entirely.

3) Would you consider moving to injectable meds? My RE said I'm responding well to the Clomid with two follicles, and that he doesn't think injectables are necessary yet, but I'm wondering if I should push that route for Round 4 if needed. With my AMH I doubt I'll be a great responder, but it's maybe worth trying? I also have an IVF consult at CNY scheduled for late April, just in case it's something I'd consider. My RE at the very beginning said I have the best chance with serial IUIs given my AMH, but I'm interested maybe in mini IVF as another option too. Since I don't have any coverage, CNY is really my only option at this point given cost.

4) Should I/would you push to try a different brand of trigger this upcoming round? I know pregnyl and novarel are other options. They are IM injections, right? 

5) How long would you wait to start a period this time? My NP at the REs office said maybe by Friday give her a call and then we'll start progesterone to get me going, but I'm so frustrated with the idea of just pumping myself full of more meds to do something by body should be doing naturally IF I in fact did ovulate.

6) Any other labs I should be getting? I need to see my PCP anyway for thyroid med refills, so I was thinking of trying to get her to run a more extensive thyroid panel, and if I do it in the next few days maybe do the reproductive hormones as well to see if it would give me insight into where I am in my cycle. I feel frustrated that the NP at my REs office is hesitant to do this.

So my wife (a MTF trans woman) and I have been trying to conceive our first since June '18.  I went off HBC at the end of May.  We tried at home for 6 months before my wife started estrogen. During that time we also banked sperm.  From about July-December, I used OPKs and vaginal temping to track my cycles.  I was consistently ovulating between CD 13-15 according to FF.  I had short cycles, with a 10-12 day LP.  Early only I also had a lot of EWCM, which then really disappeared the longer we tried. Anyway, starting in December we started working with an RE.  I got all the testing including the thing where they look at your tubes.  Everything seemed fine (other than a brief thought that maybe my thyroid levels weren't great, but that turned out ok). So, in January we started Femara 2.5 mg for 5 days.  It went ok, my follicles were a little small at CD13, but big enough to trigger (15 mm), so we did it.  36 hours later, we went in for our IUI, only to find out that somehow the sample of my wife's frozen sperm was all dead.  So that cycle was cancelled.  My wife no longer produces semen so we couldn't try at all.  We panicked that maybe all the sperm was dead, but then we did a test thaw and those sperm were ok. So now here we are in the next cycle,  I did 5 days of Femara 2.5 mg and went in on CD 11.  My follicles were only 10-11 mm.  Go back in 2 days later, the 10s haven't grown at all, the 11 mm is now 12 mm.  OPKs have all been negative (faint line).  Doctor's office calls after they get the bloodwork, new plan is for me to take 5 mg of Femara CD13-18 and come in two days later.  So last night I took the first dose.  This morning I somehow have EWCM?  I don't understand what my body is doing.  

So I guess where I'm at:

What is my body doing?  I thought for sure I was ovulating on my own just fine, why am I not ovulating now with the help of meds?

Do I have PCOS or something and no one can identify it?  I don't have like outrageous numbers of follices and no one who has done a vaginal ultrasound has seemed to think this. I also have regular cycles.  Buuut I also have a lot of body hair including dark facial hair, but I'm also Italian and French by dissent and this is kind of common?  

I have this lingering feeling that I have some sort of hormonal issue that no doctor can really identify or figure out?  I'm pretty positive I have PMDD.  I am much much more stable on hormonal birth control.  I also stopped getting my periods when I was 14, because I got too thin (BMI was like 18.5, so small but not officially anorexic).  

How is it going to be possible that I don't ovulate until after CD20? I have NEVER had a long cycle (except when I stopped getting my period in high school).  

Why am I getting EWCM now?

Also, WHYYY IS THIS SO HARD AND LIFE IS JUST UNFAIR.

Went to RE at 6 months TTC, got basic bloodwork and ultrasound. Husband got SA. Everything came back normal and we continued trying for about 6-7 months without success. 

Just went back to thesame RE last month and she gave “unexplained infertility” diagnosis and ordered HSG which happened yesterday and looked normal. 

The plan she’s proposing at this point is 3 months of medicated (femara) and monitored cycles without IUI (since husbands sperm is good she says IUI is not needed). After 3 months of this plan if we have not had success we will start IVF. 

I am fine with continuing with this doctor for medicated cycles. I actually like her personally, she’s very nice and seems smart. However, once we reach IVF I feel the stakes are significantly higher and I’m not sure how to figure out if we’ve chosen the best doctor/clinic for our needs. We will be putting a lot on the line and want to make sure we have chosen well. 

If you have actually gotten this far in my post, thank you (!) I am now finally getting to questions:

1. Has anyone had experience with RMA of New York Brooklyn office? 

2. How do you decipher information on FertilityIQ? My doctor has a good rating but doesn’t seem to have many patients with success. 

3. RMA clinic success rates are slightly higher than national average, but what are you really looking for when you look at clinic success rates? What does above national average really tell you? 

4. How do you ensure that you are going to get individualized treatment plan rather than cookie cutter experience? Many of the reviews of my doctor sound similar when they describe their treatment which is somewhat of a red flag for me.

I'm going to an orientation session tomorrow and I'm sure that will answer a lot of practical questions but I'm curious, did some of you have treatments that were just off the table for you personally? I realize that finances play a big part for those who don't have insurance coverage but if money weren't the determining factor? 

At my first RE appointment, the doctor asked if I wanted to be walked through the IVF process and I said we didn't need to talk about it because I didn't expect that I'd want to do something that intense and involved. Maybe I would just be okay with not having kids. (I had assumed we'd be doing Clomid or IUI).

A month later it turns out that due to our test results IVF is our only option (with a 45% estimated chance of success) and I'm now on the phone with insurance and signing up for class and posting here! I can't tell if I'm being swept up in the process or if I've actually learned more about IVF since that first meeting and I'm just making a more informed choice.

I'm sidelined right now waiting for ERA and Endometritis biopsy results, but I'm curious about DNA fragmentation since my husband has not had the tests. After our egg retrieval, we had 2 day five and 2 day six embryos; PGS testing showed 3 out of 4 normals although the embryologist labeled the quality as lower (two BC, one CB and one CC). The abnormal embryo has low mosaicism so RE said he would also be comfortable hanging on to it and we should consider transferring it. Both I and my husband were on hella antioxidants prior to the retrieval. We are technically unexplained but even after tons of antioxidants (ubiquinol, carotenoids, multivitamin, Omega 3) for 9 months on end (although no lifestyle changes for husband - he's overweight and drinks a beer daily), husband's sperm morphology actually decreased from 3% to 2.5%. FET #1 (SET) resulted in a beta of 2.8. I don't think we're going to do the DNA fragmentation testing unless we choose to do another egg retrieval, but that may be our next step if our planned SET FET #2 is a failure. But I'm curious how common it is that higher sperm DNA fragmentation can still result in some PGS normal embryos? Obviously PGS isn't foolproof, and we may have false positives in the mix. But I'd think 75% is pretty good for getting PGS normals in your mid-late thirties, although I'm concerned about our embryo quality...and both of these have got me wondering whether untested DNA fragmentation might play a role.

Sidenote: The only possible thing wrong that's been discovered has been my husband's low morphology; his motility is always good and his count is excellent. RE also suspects silent endo and adenomyosis, although my periods really aren't that bad (medium heavy, maybe one day of cramping that's solved with 200mg ibuprofen).

We are always glad to see members graduate, and to welcome new users in to the fold. However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.

If you haven't already, please read our sidebar and/or the sticky post listing our rules. If you're on mobile you can find this under ""About of Community"" at the top of the page.

Mention of pregnancy/ positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread. Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C"". Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules. This is to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Sometimes mentions of children/pregnancy is painful. Unsolicited mentions does include flair - a reminder to keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

Secondary infertility and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed at the moderator's discretion.

Be kind to one another. There is no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.

This is a science-minded, realistic, sometimes cynical sub. There are many communities online for people who want a more ""positive"" or ""upbeat"" experience complete with baby du$t and those who are seeking ways to ""cure"" infertility with natural remedies, gimmicks or diet cleanses have many places to go. People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).

Sex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. Infertility isn't cute, and neither are the terms we use. There has been an increase in automod triggers for banned terms/acronyms. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content. AF means ""As Fuck"" and the use of AF for referring to a period is not allowed.

No solicitations will be allowed for monetary or medication donations. To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed. Posts by members who want to donate their leftover meds to others here are allowed.

If you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button. The ""report"" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment. This will help us to actively moderate this community and makes it easier to catch posts or comments that break our rules.

As always, we are so proud to moderate this amazing community of strong, diverse and compassionate women (and men). Thank you!

However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already, please read our sidebar and/or the sticky post listing our rules. If you&#39;re on mobile you can find this under &quot;About of Community&quot; at the top of the page.</p>

<p>Mention of pregnancy/ positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread. Vague and sensitive mentions to &quot;success&quot; are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies &quot;I had success with A,B,C&quot;. Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules. This is to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Sometimes mentions of children/pregnancy is painful. Unsolicited mentions does include flair - a reminder to keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.</p>

<p>Secondary infertility and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses &quot;blessed&quot;, &quot;miraculously,&quot; &quot;easily conceived&quot;, etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed at the moderator&#39;s discretion.</p>

<p>Be kind to one another. There is no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.</p>

<p>This is a science-minded, realistic, sometimes cynical sub. There are many communities online for people who want a more &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;upbeat&quot; experience complete with baby du$t and those who are seeking ways to &quot;cure&quot; infertility with natural remedies, gimmicks or diet cleanses have many places to go. People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub&#39;s audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).</p>

<p>Sex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. Infertility isn&#39;t cute, and neither are the terms we use. There has been an increase in automod triggers for banned terms/acronyms. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content. AF means &quot;As Fuck&quot; and the use of AF for referring to a period is not allowed.</p>

<p>No solicitations will be allowed for monetary or medication donations. To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don&#39;t strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed. Posts by members who want to donate their leftover meds to others here are allowed.</p>

<p>If you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button. The &quot;report&quot; feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment. This will help us to actively moderate this community and makes it easier to catch posts or comments that break our rules.</p>

**\[To: Name(s)\]**

\[Company\] Human Resources

\[Address\]

Dear \[Company\] Human Resources:

As a \[Company\] employee, I feel the need to reach out on behalf of myself and my coworkers. Please regard this letter as part of my employee engagement survey.

My partner and I are suffering with the disease of infertility. We are not alone. 1 in 8 couples have trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy (2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth, CDC). 

I was surprised to learn that \[Company\] does not cover infertility treatment, given that it’s such a common problem. **I know \[Company\] cares about family. Your choice to cover these services would better align with our company’s values.**

Coverage of infertility services would allow me to:

* Focus better on my job with fewer financial worries
* Have a less stressful home life, without constant worry about how to get the support we need to start a family
* Feel that \[Company\] supports me as a person — not just as an employee

This coverage is not as expensive as you might think. Studies indicate that including comprehensive infertility coverage in a health benefit package may actually reduce costs and improve outcomes. For example, in a survey conducted by the consulting firm William M. Mercer, 91 percent of employers who began offering infertility treatment experienced no increase in medical costs as a result of providing this much-needed coverage.

When infertility treatment is not covered, patients are often forced to choose other treatments, even when these other treatments are more costly, more invasive, and less likely to be effective. For example, a woman who has trouble conceiving because of blocked fallopian tubes has the best likelihood for successful pregnancy with in-vitro fertilization. When this isn’t covered, her only option is invasive tubal surgery. Not only is this less likely to result in pregnancy, but it can cost $8,000-13,000! According to research, “The decline in use of high-cost procedures like tubal surgery would likely offset the cost to include IVF as a benefit and provide improved health outcomes” (William M. Mercer. “Infertility as a Covered Benefit,” 1997).

According to another study, comprehensive infertility coverage **may actually reduce premium expense** by as much as $1 per member, per month. Insurance premiums now indirectly provide coverage for “hidden” infertility benefits. The costs for surgeries to remove scarring in the fallopian tubes for women or remove varicose veins for men, for example, were calculated to be adequate to cover more effective and often less expensive treatments such as ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination and in-vitro fertilization (Richard E. Blackwell. “The Hidden Costs of Infertility Treatment in Employee Health Benefits Plans”, 2000).

I understand that changing insurance coverage is no small feat. If necessary, please consider an alternative option: a stipend. This stipend (typically $10,000-20,000) could be made available to employees, in order to help cover the cost of treatment, adoption, or surrogacy.

Considering how very important fertility issues can be to so many people, I hope \[Company\] will begin offering infertility coverage and support to our family building efforts. Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

A concerned \[Company\] employee

101,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Unexplained, ttc over 2yrs, waiting to start last cycle of clomid/gonal f before moving onto IUI. My RE doesn't think IUI is worth our time because all of our testing has come back normal and we don't have MFI. I'm not a great responder, my amh is 1.5, but we can't afford ivf at this time. My cycles were normal until right before I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, then they got very long and unpredictable. Levo has my tsh around 1.25, but my cycles never went back to normal. So I don't ovulate regularly on my own. That is our only 'off' thing. 

Anyway, I'm a slow/not wonderful responder and I've begun to wonder if my egg quality is bad. I did gain weight because of the hypothyroidism (hashimotos btw). I don't have PCOS.

This is what I've come up with so far:

Morning before breakfast: Levothyroxin, Vitamin E (vitamin e is for lining because of repeat clomid use), one baby aspirin

After breakfast: 300mg CoQ10, 50mg Vitamin D 

Before dinner: pantoprozole (for stomach issues, I've been having trouble fitting this one in bc it needs to be taken on an empty stomach and can't be taken with a lot of other meds/vitamins

After dinner: 300mg CoQ10, prenatal. 

That's all I've come up with so far. Because of the MTHFR, I know I should be taking a prenatal with or additional methylfolate instead of folic acid. I'm having some trouble finding it where I live though. Is folate the same thing as folic acid in terms of what I need it for? Or is folate what I need to be taking? (Basically, is methlyfolate the same as folate?)

Also, I was told I should be taking vitamin B. I did pick up vitamin b6, but after googling it it seems like the dose is too high to take daily and I should look for a B complex for daily use. But I've also vaguely remember hearing something about B vimatins (can't remember which), negatively impacting ovulation or implantation/lining or something like that...but it's possible I misunderstood. 

Any other recommendations? I'm most concerned about egg quality and lining. But I also don't want to be taking anything that negatively affects any of the prescription fertility stuff (Clomid, gonal, ovidril, progesterone). The progesterone is just precautionary. I'm not sure why, but from ovulation to the time I start spotting before a period is around 17 days, not on progesterone. I have no idea why my luteul phase is so damn long. But it is, and it's annoying. I'm getting off topic though. I'm curious to hear what everyone has to recommend. Google has a lot of contradicting information. Thanks everyone!

This thread has now been combined with the Weekly Post-Beta Concerns & Discussion. For a whole week this thread will be posted for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, your pregnancy announcement is allowed in this thread, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

We have a follow up appt with our RE this week to talk about our next step. I don’t know how they will treat the macrophages part. 
I’m just getting so depressed and I don’t know what will be our next step. We only have 3 PGS tested normal frozen embryos left and I don’t know if we should do another EFT or just transfer and hope for a miracle or do another retrieval to bank more embryos or look into surrogacy😢</p>

I asked some follow up questions and questions about scheduling, but they never respomded. So like the SIS, I call on CD1 to schedule it for CD3-10ish. I start spotting yesterday (Thurs) so I call. For whatever reason the receptionist days I have to speak to the nurse, and to leave a voicemail on the nurse line if they don't answer. So I do that at 2pm. No call back Thurs afternoon. No call Friday morning. We're looking at a full day off work for this someday next week so I really need to get this scheduled before COB today. I call back around 11. Directed to leave another voicemail, this time with the nurse manager. Fine. Finally she calls me back around 2pm (right before I was going to call again because they close at 3). 

Basically she says they dropped the ball and there aren't any open procedure appts next week. It's more complicated than that but I don't want to type out all the details.  So she said they called in a birth control prescription for me that I now have to go pick up and take until they can get me in.

Upset that we are delayed another whole cycle. I did send an email expressing my frustration after I stopped sobbing in the work conference room.

I know there are bigger fish to fry, that others have been delayed linger I'm sure. But this really strung since it was an error, which they admitted to, on their part. So much of infertility is out of our control, this was supposed to be one thing that could be in our control and it go f-ed up.

I have PCOS (high DHEA, insulin resistance, history of high free testosterone, but no cystic ovaries since 2010 or so), hypothyroidism, and was diagnosed with DOR due to an AMH of .6 and a follicle count as low as 3, though as high as mid 20s. Average these days is around 10 - 13.

I'm fresh off of two VERY disappointing cycles with fucked up retrievals. I think there's an issue with my current protocol based on past responses, though my MD went to egg quality as an issue. Which I don't dispute since I've only had 3 blasts out of 10 embryos across 4 cycles (we're hopefully freezing at day 3 for cycle 5). But I don't think my egg quality has abruptly tanked to the degree where 5/6 of my eggs are completely immature.

\-------

Cycle #1 : No proming. Follistim 300, Menopur 150 - 225, Ganirelix. Triggered with 10k Pregnyl. : 8 follicles, 7 eggs, 4 mature, 3 fertilized, 0 blasts. One embryo barely made it past fertilization, the other two died off between day 3 and day 5. 

Cycle #2 : also did acupuncture + supplements (coQ10, acai, grapeseed, vit D, multi, inositol) this cycle. Estradiol priming. Follistim 450, Lupron 20 2x daily, HCG 10. Triggered with 10k Pregnyl. : 11 follicles, 11 eggs, 5 mature, 4 fertilized, 3 blasts, 1 PGS normal, 1 mosaic. Estradiol was 2500 day before retrieval. 

Cycle #3 : acupuncture + supplements. Estradiol priming. Follistim 450, Lupron 20 2x daily, HCG 10 : converted to IUI for poor response - only 2 follicles grew. Failed. This was a ridic hail mary as we used MESA retrieved sperm for the IUI which is generally too low for this.

Cycle #4 : (new clinic) BCP priming. Clomid 50, Letrozole 5, (two days later added) Follistim 150 then incr to 225.  Double trigger 250 Ovidrel, 15 Lupron. Reaction to anesthesia during the procedure botched the egg retrieval so : 8 follicles, 2 eggs retrieved, 2 fertilized, 0 blasts. One died off early, the other just before blast. Estradiol was 885 day before retrieval. 

Cycle #5 : BCP priming. Clomid 50, Letrozole 2.5, Follistim 225. Double trigger 250 Ovidrel, 15 Lupron. 11 follicles. Ovulated left ovary before procedure (which makes zero sense, these weren't even the largest follicles), so only 3 retrieved, 4 follicles were ""empty"" from the right. 2/3 eggs were ""very immature"" (GV) and 1 fertilized. That one didn’t even make it to day 3 and stalled at one cell. Estradiol was 1333 day before retrieval. 

\--------

I'm not sure whether the issue with this most recent cycle is with the protocol or the trigger, given the volume of empty follicles and immature eggs despite the sizes being decent and indicating 5 or 6 mature eggs before retrieval (25, 20, 18.5, 18, 18, 16, 14, 12.5, 12, 11, 11). 

I really welcome any and all thoughts. I think I am going to resume acupuncture, as the one blast cycle was where I did the most acupuncture and revisit supplements. But I'm confused as to what I should be asking, suggestions around protocol or trigger etc. We have four vials of TESE sperm left, and assuming all are good, plan to use them all but may have to start spacing out cycles due to the money aspect.

Everything checked out as within normal limits, leading to the tentative diagnosis of unexplained infertility. Except for one thing: the doctor wants me to be tested for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome before we proceed with IUI. She saw it come up in my family history. I marked it because I know my dad has APS, but I didn’t know what it really meant.

So she explains to me that APS can be a cause of recurrent miscarriage and infertility. Given my history and my dad’s diagnosis, she thinks it’s worth testing. It’s apparently a fairly simple “fix” for pregnancy - they use a blood thinner or aspirin to prevent microclots that could threaten a pregnancy.

Sounds good. Ok. Do the test. 

So then I go home to find out more about APS. Y’all, infertility and miscarriage would be the least of my concerns with APS. I knew my dad had it and has a risk of blood clots, but my dad is 60 so I thought it was just one of those things. It is not. It’s rare, it’s an autoimmune disorder related to blood clotting and it’s life threatening. Blood thinners are dangerous, but so is the syndrome. Expected lifespan is 15 years shorter than average. It can be disabling.

So now I’m freaking TF out. It sounded like a really nice, neat solution to all my problems at first, but it’s so much more than that. Yes, maybe it might help me conceive and give birth to a live baby. But I won’t ever be able to get life insurance; it could be a really terrible pre existing condition if the US insurance system goes back to that; if I did get pregnant I could **die** before my children grow up. I may never meet my grandchildren. And what, god forbid, if I pass it along to my children? They’d have the same concerns! 

I’ve been wracked with anxiety and panic ever since then. I can’t sleep. The order is in, but I haven’t gone to the lab for the test. I’m scared. I don’t want to know the answer.

But I won’t ever be able to get life insurance; it could be a really terrible pre existing condition if the US insurance system goes back to that; if I did get pregnant I could <strong>die</strong> before my children grow up. I may never meet my grandchildren. And what, god forbid, if I pass it along to my children? They’d have the same concerns! </p>

<p>I’ve been wracked with anxiety and panic ever since then. I can’t sleep. The order is in, but I haven’t gone to the lab for the test. I’m scared. I don’t want to know the answer. I’m thinking of stopping this whole thing and not trying anymore. Maybe we should stop and be content with our family as just us.</p>

Long time lurker first time poster, I'm here for my own stuff but right now I really need ur advice on how to be a good friend please. 

So, really good girlfriend of mine (the couple are both my friend but her specifically) have just reached the end of their fertility journey without success. They have been through the absolute ringer - three hyperstimulation events, 31 embryos non of which made it past day 5, extensive investigations,  ovarian hemorrhage. Everything. It has been torture, and they are done. I don't blame them. 

She is now heading down the hysterectomy pathway, which will be another battle for her as we are all under 30. 

I want to know how to help, while also holding some resilience and hope for our own journey. Normally we go for big walks with the dogs together but shes only a week out from her last hyperstim and is recovering. Through the course of her treatment I've snuck care packages into her mail box, but somehow that doesn't feel like enough atm. Is there a gift that says ""this is so fucked, I'm so fucking sorry, I hope they take ur fucking uterus out so u can be well for the first time in 10 years""?

Not sure that this is the correct place for this post, but I'm new here. Please let me know if this belongs in a thread. My partner and I had been TTC for a year when we went to see a few fertility specialist. We settled on a pretty low frills clinic that's affiliated with a hospital, but we liked that money wasn't their number one motivation. We also live in Canada, where there's limited IVF funding, and they were able to guarantee us our spot the fastest. We're scheduled to start IVF in April, but after doing 3 medicated IUI cycles with them, I quickly realized that I will have to be my own advocate. For instance, I'm not guaranteed that my doctor (who knowns my case best) will be the one doing the egg retrieval, it's whoever's on call that day. Even the residents that do the daily ultrasounds are instructed not to speak with you and slow things down. All the information's relayed by a RN's, some of whom are much more experienced than others. It's not ideal, but it's also not all bad. And if we back out of our round now, we would end up on a waiting list at another clinic, and I'm 37. 

That's where I need help! I've been doing all the research I possibly can, and this subreddit has been the best resource I could find.

I am a researcher at the University of Manchester who is currently conducting a project on women's experiences of egg freezing. I am looking for women who either **have frozen their eggs**, or who **have considered doing so**, to take part in interviews via Skype or the telephone. I aim to conduct one interview with each participant. So far, the interviews have lasted between 30 minutes to an hour. There will be no cost to any participants, via phone calls, for example.

&#x200B;

Initially, I was focusing largely on the kinds of support networks that women engaged with when deciding to freeze their eggs (for example, friends, family, etc). There isn't a great deal of research on women's experiences of egg freezing however, and so I wanted the project to be led by the participants and their experiences as much as possible. My interview schedule has therefore evolved to focus on a number of issues that others have mentioned (for example, opinions on media perceptions of egg freezing). Generally speaking however, the questions are very open for the participant to answer in whatever way they would like - no participant's experience is the same after all!

&#x200B;

Here is an example of some of the questions I will ask:

&#x200B;

Would you say that you had a specific support network? Did you talk to others about your decision? What personal responses have you received? Are you in a relationship? Is this something that is important to you? Tell me about how those around you felt about your decision to freeze your eggs

&#x200B;

If you are someone who has been through the egg freezing process, or is seriously considering freezing their eggs, and you are happy to talk about your experiences with me, please get in touch at: [Georgia.hibbert@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:Georgia.hibbert@manchester.ac.uk)

Looking for some advice please. I don't have a clotting issue. I've had all the RPL testing. I'm about to do my 7th PGS transfer with our last euploid. Is baby aspirin possibly the culprit here? I feel like we're getting so damn close.

Transfer 1 - CP

Used baby aspirin.

Transfer 2 - MC, blighted ovum/no sac at 6 weeks

Used baby aspirin.

Surgery to correct sperm DNA fragmentation (33% -> 14%). Retrieval #2.

Transfer 3 - MC, HB at 5+6 (first time ever), SCH bleed, no HB 3 days later

Used baby aspirin. Discontinued BA at SCH Dx.

Transfer 4 - negative No BA. Used lovenox transfer through beta.

Transfer 5 - negative No BA. Used lovenox transfer through beta.

Hysteroscopy/lap. Removed a couple of teensy polyps. Negative for endometritis.

Transfer 6 - MC, HB at 6+2, large SCH pressing on sack. Even larger SCH at 7+2 with non viable HR. Used baby aspirin until beta and then switched to lovenox. Continued lovenox after SCH Dx.

We used the BA on this most recent transfer because after 2 negatives we (RE and us) wanted to go back to what was working. He then wanted to switch to lovenox as it's shown to maybe have a small benefit. But now I'm thinking that BA is causing recurrent SCH bleeds, the lovenox made it worse, and the next transfer should be with NO anticoagulants.

Long story short, I didn't have my period for over a year. It restarted last year but is more unregular than not. I was diagnosed with PCOS because of the irregular periods but I do not have any of the other symptoms.

Husband and I have been tested for what seems like everything under the sun. I used to not mind needles but lately I've been feeling myself cringing whenever I need another blood test.

We finally got an abnormal test result this morning but I have no idea what the heck to do with the information. My anti-mullerian hormone level is 7.92 ng/ml. I guess the confirms my diagnosis of PCOS but almost everything I find online is about low anti-mullerian levels. 

Is this just another piece of information that doesn't really help me resolve anything? Previously, I was told I have mildly elevated TSH levels so we corrected that with synthroid and then I had low vit. D levels so we corrected that too. But none of these are SOLID reasons as to why I would be infertile. 

My doctor wanted to start me on femara but every time we get ready to do so it gets delayed because of something. I'm starting to feel resentful... It's been 2 years and we haven't even started fertility drugs. My doctors refused to consider the year I didn't have my period as a trying year because I wasn't ovulating but it's not like they had any solutions for me then either. I was relaxed and patient about the process but I think 2 years is more than anyone can ask of me to be relaxed and patient. 

&#x200B;

I guess my question is, what do I do about high anti-mullerian hormone level? Do I just stay the course and start femara with my next period? What does a high anti-mullerian level mean in the real world and how does it apply to the situation?

I've been using the oil for about 10months(cbd and thc together) and it's helped me with high levels of anxiety, with depression, weight loss...energy levels. Better outlook on life. It's really been a miracle for me.
I had IVF about a year ago(before I started using the oil) and it worked but I had a miscarriage at 3weeks.
(I have stage 2 endo with both tubes blocked)
I've just started my stims for the next IVF. I'm much more healthy and positive this time around. 
Has anyone done IVF while taking the oil? I do not want to stop taking it, it's also regulated my cycle from a 35 day cycle (very painful) to 29 days ( mild pain). I figure, if it's been so good for me why stop now when I may need it? I don't want my hormones getting all out of whack (which they will anyway die to the meds)
So...any opinions? Only open minded people please, I don't need judgement and negative comments. Just advice from a good place.

184,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband had a kidney transplant about 20 years ago.  He's doing well kidney wise, but has been considered to be in end stage renal disease for about 20 years because a transplant can only do so much. To that end, his renal function is stable, but not like someone with two functioning kidneys.  About 1.5 years ago, his adrenals failed due to the medications he's been on for 20 years and we got sent to an endocrinologist.  At his followup this year, my husband asked the endocrinologist about a symptom which sounded suspiciously like a hot flash - suddenly sweaty and hot, easing in about 15 minutes.  (Of course, he had never told me about this.) The endocrinologist thought it might be a testosterone issue, so he tested ALL the things and his DHEA came back low (22), his FSH came back high (10.2) and his testosterone was borderline low (\~300).

We are following up with endocrinology to determine how to best treat this but I think it's going to put IVF on hold for now.  First and foremost, I want him to feel better and I know he's pretty miserable with the ""hot flashes"".  He does have a frozen sperm sample that also came back low, but I'm thinking this may be a hormone issue instead of a medication issue (some of the transplant meds can really screw with the sperm count), or a combination of the two. We see our RE on Thursday to hopefully get a plan moving forward. Of course, I have  fibroids starting to grow again, plus I'm getting older, so putting off IVF until we get his hormones leveled out maybe isn't the best option for me.  

All this planning and I feel like the latest results are a slap in the face. The RE seemed confident he could get me pregnant even with my husband's low count, but I'm dubious, especially since that was before we knew about the hormone issue.  And even if the few sperm looked good, what's their actual quality, especially in a pretty hostile environment?  Has anyone had something like this happen so late in the game?  We were hoping to do our first egg retrieval in May or June and I'm worried it's going to take a lot longer to get his hormones back to where they should be.

We've been focused on work, getting married and buying a house, and getting a puppy.  I feel like we are now closing in at the point where we will either need some substantial medical intervention... Or make our peace with being parents to furbabies.  I've been scared, miserable, and feeling very lonely.

Him: 33. after telling his regular doc that we'd been trying so long to get pregnant his doc ordered an SA.  We got the results back in December.  15 sperm with bad tails.  Yikes.  He also has a varicocele that he figures has been there and noticable for 20+ years at this point.  His doc told us to go to a reproductive endocrinologist who could then refer us to a urologist if need be.

Me: DXed with PCOS at 21.  I'm now 32.  Went on the pill 2011-2016 bc I was ovulating and getting bad PMDD.  Went off the pill late summer 2016 bc we decided we we're open to getting pregnant... And the new pill was having nasty side effects (super fatigued, bled for over a month straight).  I had a few decent ovulatory cycles, then tbh stress shut that down on any regular basis... And got me a subconjunctival hemmorhage and pneumonia (I can track these dates and what was stressing me out pretty well.)  Where I feel this gets more complicated is  my mother had ovarian cancer.  She got it in her 50s after having and breast feeding multiple kids, and doing the 5+ years on the pill.  Her maternal grandmother maaaaay also have had it (and that woman's vagina was a clown car.) Mom has an appointment to get genetically tested in a few months.  I have not been tested.

Because of my work schedule we won't be able to schedule all the doctors appointments till like 4 months from now.  I'm looking at the costs ($, emotionally, time, physically) and already feeling overwhelmed.

So I'm left wondering if the immediate family history of ovarian cancer contraindicates the drugs that are frequently RXed to treat infertility (PCOS + basically azoospermia)?  If anyone has had a similar experience?  Or has any scientific literature they can point me to?  Calming words of wisdom as I watch women around me all get accidentally pregnant and then look at me and wonder why I'm not joining them?

210,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone. I’m new to this sub and to reddit, and I would greatly appreciate any and all advice for how to proceed with my infertility treatment and surgeries.

My husband (39M) and I (32F) have been trying to conceive for about two years now. Full background is as follows:

I had surgery to remove an endometrioma on my right ovary in March 2016. After surgery, I found out that I also had endometriosis elsewhere in my pelvis, which was removed. The doctor also removed my impacted Paraguard IUD. Tubes were tested and came back clear. At three week post-op, the cyst had returned at full-size. I only recently found out that the doctor drained the cyst instead of removing it.

Began trying to conceive in December 2016, switched gynecologists and continued to monitor the cyst. In May 2017, underwent laparoscopic surgery to remove the now 8.5 cm cyst. Part of my right ovary was removed as well. Tubes were tested, looked clear. This entire time, my doctor was telling me not to worry, I was young, etc. and wouldn’t run basic fertility tests. Was told the cyst may have been compromising my fertility, but since it was removed I should be fine. Doctor told me I could either take clomid unmonitored or move to IUI with or without clomid.

Since my cycles are regular and I apparently ovulate (judging by ovulation strips, cycle dates, and ultrasounds) I chose to do natural cycle IUI with an ovidrel trigger shot. First cycle was April 2018. Progesterone was tested, looked great. The cycle failed. I later had 3 more natural cycles with trigger, and one IUI with clomid and trigger (December 2018.) All five cycles failed.

I spoke to another doctor at my clinic in December, and he ordered blood tests (progesterone, FSH) and an HSG. Progesterone was slightly elevated, and FSH was elevated at 12.8. Follow up AMH was ordered and came back at .38. Was told it was low, but no one seemed concerned. I researched the numbers, and realized that I clearly have DOR. Which in hindsight makes sense, given my history of endometriosis and ovarian surgeries. Husband’s sperm was tested; apparently it’s ideal in both quality and quantity. So I’m the problem.

Had an extremely traumatic HSG in December. I was told by the doctor performing the test (not my doctor) that my tubes were clear and all was well. I then called my doctor to follow up, and was told that the HSG showed a filling defect or air bubble. Had a SIS two weeks ago to check on the suspected air bubble, and my doctor found was he thinks is an endometrial polyp in *a completely different part of my uterus.*

Has anyone had experiences with IUD scarring looking like a potential polyp? I’m no expert, but on the ultrasound it didn’t look like there was a round or protuberant growth – it was more like the saline was flowing underneath the endometrial layer. Could this be scar tissue from my impacted IUD?

I’m going in for my first consult with a RE later this week, and I feel like such an idiot for wasting so much time with gynecologists who either didn’t care about my fertility or were inept. I’ve been reading that I should have moved on to a RE/IVF first thing after my cyst was identified and/or removed, and that my AMH should have been tested before my surgeries. None of my doctors mentioned any of this.

I’m also worried about having surgery to remove the suspected polyp – because of potential scarring and/or an increased cancer risk. My doctor wanted to use a manual morcellator, which terrifies me since I’ve had a cervical cancer scare (LEEP, etc.) and I have an increased risk of ovarian cancer because of my cyst. I know that a potential polyp only has a 1-3% chance of being cancerous, but with my track record, I’m a bit paranoid and don’t like the idea of potentially cancerous cells being ground up and spewed around my uterus. Does anyone know the most effective/conservative method to remove endometrial anomalies?

I’m new to this sub and to reddit, and I would greatly appreciate any and all advice for how to proceed with my infertility treatment and surgeries.</p>

<p>My husband (39M) and I (32F) have been trying to conceive for about two years now. Full background is as follows:</p>

<p>I had surgery to remove an endometrioma on my right ovary in March 2016. After surgery, I found out that I also had endometriosis elsewhere in my pelvis, which was removed. The doctor also removed my impacted Paraguard IUD. Tubes were tested and came back clear. At three week post-op, the cyst had returned at full-size. I only recently found out that the doctor drained the cyst instead of removing it.</p>

<p>Began trying to conceive in December 2016, switched gynecologists and continued to monitor the cyst. In May 2017, underwent laparoscopic surgery to remove the now 8.5 cm cyst. Part of my right ovary was removed as well. Tubes were tested, looked clear. This entire time, my doctor was telling me not to worry, I was young, etc. and wouldn’t run basic fertility tests. Was told the cyst may have been compromising my fertility, but since it was removed I should be fine. Doctor told me I could either take clomid unmonitored or move to IUI with or without clomid.</p>

<p>Since my cycles are regular and I apparently ovulate (judging by ovulation strips, cycle dates, and ultrasounds) I chose to do natural cycle IUI with an ovidrel trigger shot. First cycle was April 2018. Progesterone was tested, looked great. The cycle failed. I later had 3 more natural cycles with trigger, and one IUI with clomid and trigger (December 2018.) All five cycles failed.</p>

<p>I spoke to another doctor at my clinic in December, and he ordered blood tests (progesterone, FSH) and an HSG. Progesterone was slightly elevated, and FSH was elevated at 12.8. Follow up AMH was ordered and came back at .38. Was told it was low, but no one seemed concerned. I researched the numbers, and realized that I clearly have DOR. Which in hindsight makes sense, given my history of endometriosis and ovarian surgeries. Husband’s sperm was tested; apparently it’s ideal in both quality and quantity. So I’m the problem.</p>

<p>Had an extremely traumatic HSG in December. I was told by the doctor performing the test (not my doctor) that my tubes were clear and all was well. I then called my doctor to follow up, and was told that the HSG showed a filling defect or air bubble. Had a SIS two weeks ago to check on the suspected air bubble, and my doctor found was he thinks is an endometrial polyp in <em>a completely different part of my uterus.</em></p>

<p>Has anyone had experiences with IUD scarring looking like a potential polyp? I’m no expert, but on the ultrasound it didn’t look like there was a round or protuberant growth – it was more like the saline was flowing underneath the endometrial layer. Could this be scar tissue from my impacted IUD?</p>

<p>I’m going in for my first consult with a RE later this week, and I feel like such an idiot for wasting so much time with gynecologists who either didn’t care about my fertility or were inept. I’ve been reading that I should have moved on to a RE/IVF first thing after my cyst was identified and/or removed, and that my AMH should have been tested before my surgeries. None of my doctors mentioned any of this.</p>

<p>I’m also worried about having surgery to remove the suspected polyp – because of potential scarring and/or an increased cancer risk. My doctor wanted to use a manual morcellator, which terrifies me since I’ve had a cervical cancer scare (LEEP, etc.) and I have an increased risk of ovarian cancer because of my cyst. I know that a potential polyp only has a 1-3% chance of being cancerous, but with my track record, I’m a bit paranoid and don’t like the idea of potentially cancerous cells being ground up and spewed around my uterus. Does anyone know the most effective/conservative method to remove endometrial anomalies?</p>

We are about to make a big decision and I'm just looking for any advice that might be helpful. 

We began trying to concieve right after our wedding in 2016. After about 8 months with no success we did a few clomid cycles, and then met with a fertility clinic near us when that didn't work. We ended up doing 4 rounds of medicated IUI-- all fails. We moved on to start an IVF cycle- the cycle ended up getting cancelled due to lack of ovarian response.

I was starting to feel a little uneasy with the clinic we were going to for various reasons-- but mostly because it felt like no one was giving us any direction or guidance once we had a failed cycle-- be that the IUI cycles or the IVF. 

I decided to get a second opinion. I sent over all of the paperwork from the first clinic to a new doctor. Immediately he said, ""did they go over you AMH levels or FSH levels with you?"" I said no, and honestly didn't really know what they were. He explained what they measured and said that a woman of my age (35) should have an AMH level of about 1.5, and that mine (when it was taken a year ago) was .165. Of course he said this isn't a predictor of egg quality, just how many are left in the basket. We then talked about my FSH levels, which seemed to also run on the high side. 

Needless to say, my husband and I freaked out. Why was this NEVER explained to us at the previous clinic? We just assumed that everything was fine since they never brought it up to us. We were angry, hurt, and now facing the reality of our situation. We have a serious egg problem. 

The new doctor suggested we try another IUI since I still had 2 left that were covered by my insurance. So we did that in December of 2018 and that also failed. This doctor has also indicated that IVF with my own eggs is not really an option, and that the best route for success would be donor eggs.

 So that's where we are at now. We have a consultation with the doctor tomorrow to really explore the donor egg route. If anyone has been in a similar situation, or has used donor eggs and has any tips for questions to ask or things you would have done differently, I would greatly appreciate the input. 

TL/DR: Evidently my eggs are crap. Doctor says my best chances for success is going the egg donor route. I'm lost, confused and grieving. Any help is much appreciated.

Im 33 husband is 32 we have Male factor infertility due to him having op on undescended testicles when he was 8. My amh was lower end of normal at 14.
We did our first icsi cycle last yr got 4 top grade embryos. Fresh transfer was chemical, 2 FET's have been negatives. We are getting ready to transfer our last embryo.

For my last two FET's we just took 4 fematab a day then 5 days of crinone gel and then transfer. Both times my lining was measuring over 8 with a triple line so all looked good.

Sorting out our protocol with the clinic for fet

We are doing scratch cycle beforehand

Then we have changed from Fematab to Progynova and switched from crinone gel to cyclogest

The other things Im wondering about are 

1. The use of a trigger shot...has anyone done this as part of an fet?

2. The use of the hcg injection days 1, 3 & 5 after transfer....has anyone tried this?

3. The use of the bondi protocol which is a clexane blood thinner injection and Prednisolone a low dose steroid...this seems to be used for immune issues or repeated ivf fails... has anyone used this without being tested for immune issues?? Is it damagin to use this method without havin the tests done??

We have one embryo left so wana throw everythin at it

238,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi All,

I've tried to put warnings and be as conscientious as I can about what I write, but please let me know if something I write is inappropriate or unwelcome, it's truly unintentional. 

&#x200B;

Seeking thoughts on # of embryos to transfer for #2 after preeclampsia.  

TW: success and failure

After 2 ectopic pregnancies and tubes removed in 2016, we did 1 IVF retrieval that resulted in 8 embryos.  The immediate fresh transfer w/ 1 embryo failed (prob high progesterone).  After that we did a FET w/ 2 embryos.  Note: a few days after the positive beta, I experienced heavy bleeding and passed clots. A couple weeks later we confirmed healthy singleton pregnancy.  In talking to the doctor, he thinks it's likely that the other embryo implanted and  I miscarried the other embryo when I bled and passed clots.  Fast forward to 28 weeks and I developed Preeclampsia and after a LOT of touch and go (i.e. 3x wk ultrasounds and lots of craziness) had baby at 35 weeks (very sick, but unrelated to Pre-E and fine now).  

In December 2018 we started for # 2 with our remaining embryos and on the first FET (technically FET #2) of this attempt (transferred 1), I was successful until I miscarried around 6 wks ( on New Year's Day no less).  RE thinks that certainly this miscarriage and likely the FET #1 embryo were the result of chromosomal anomalies (we haven't done genetic testing b/c that wasn't an identified issue). I now have 4 embryos left and we will not be doing another IVF retrieval, so these 4 are it.  We also don't plan to do genetic testing b/c it's basically the cost of a FET.  

The Dr basically said that he would normally say to transfer 2 at this next cycle, except with my history of Pre-E (hence why I told y'all about it), he would probably say to do just one.  The chances of complications with twins is much higher from the start and then when you  add a predisposition to Pre-E, it could end up in basically lots of disastrous circumstances.  But again, we're fine with the actual idea of twins.

 By my (bad) math I started with 8 embryos, 4 have been transferred  with 1 failure, 2 chromosomal anomalies and 1 success. Anyways, just curious what # of embryos others think makes sense based on these circumstances, e.g. 1 or 2.  Also, if it at all matters, in between the ectopics, I'm like 75% sure I had a CP , but really wasn't super into tracking anything at that point, so it's very unverified and I could have just been crazypants.  Of course, this post is potentially moot as I'm awaiting an MRI to tell whether I tore the tendon in my big toe while literally walking across the living room.  If I tore it, it sounds like I'll be having toe surgery (ha!) instead of a FET cycle.  (also, anyone have (mild?) surgery and then immediately do a FET?) 

Any thoughts would be most welcome!

I was diagnosed with PCOS 5 years ago.

On Wednesday I was told I have Mthfr mutation and then on Friday I was told I also have and Autoimmune Disease that is attacking my thyroid.

Im feeling pretty defeated right now and upset that this might be the end of the road for us having children 


Update: Thank you all so much for taking the time to reply. I had been having a bad couple of days trying to get my head around everything. I was told by my GP that I needed to go see my specialist when she found out that i havent received the results from all the testing we did after my last miscarriage. My GP only told me about the Mthfr mutation because i kept pushing her to tell me whats in the results.

I'm a 34F, no known fertility issues and we're doing IVF with PGD to avoid a genetic condition. My AMH and FSH were good and so we were hopeful. Well, today we went for the eco and apparently I'm not responding v well to the stims... I only have 3 follicles that are ready for retrieval... one super dominant. They upped my meds and we will stim for 3 more days, then go back on Monday for another eco. If it doesn't look like we have at least 5-7 follicles ready for retrieval, they advised to skip extraction this cycle and start a new stim cycle next month and hope that I respond better (the thinking is that doing a retrieval and getting only 3 eggs is just not worth the stress of the surgery). We need about 30 eggs retrieved so that we can hope for about 20 fertilized and then have at least 6 get to day 5 so we can send them for testing.

&#x200B;

Feeling frustrated right now because I guess I was overly optimistic because we weren't doing IVF for fertility reasons so I  thought it would be relatively ""easy"" for us, but I guess that was naive and that's not the case. Letting myself wallow a bit today but then I need to put my big girl panties on because I know stress and negativity can't be good for the process.

&#x200B;

We started stimming on Sunday and today was our first eco. I&#39;m a 34F, no known fertility issues and we&#39;re doing IVF with PGD to avoid a genetic condition. My AMH and FSH were good and so we were hopeful. Well, today we went for the eco and apparently I&#39;m not responding v well to the stims... I only have 3 follicles that are ready for retrieval... one super dominant. They upped my meds and we will stim for 3 more days, then go back on Monday for another eco. If it doesn&#39;t look like we have at least 5-7 follicles ready for retrieval, they advised to skip extraction this cycle and start a new stim cycle next month and hope that I respond better (the thinking is that doing a retrieval and getting only 3 eggs is just not worth the stress of the surgery). We need about 30 eggs retrieved so that we can hope for about 20 fertilized and then have at least 6 get to day 5 so we can send them for testing.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Feeling frustrated right now because I guess I was overly optimistic because we weren&#39;t doing IVF for fertility reasons so I  thought it would be relatively &quot;easy&quot; for us, but I guess that was naive and that&#39;s not the case. Letting myself wallow a bit today but then I need to put my big girl panties on because I know stress and negativity can&#39;t be good for the process.</p>

My clinic charges ~$22k for IVF with ICSI (can’t remember if PGS is included or $5k extra) which includes estimate for meds. It’s the only option and they only do FETs, about $3200 each FET, so only ‘cycle’ is a bit over $25k. After looking around on this thread, that seems expensive, I think.

* July 2018: Wife was advised by OB/GYN that all seemed normal, and to follow up with infertility if 6 more months passed.
* November 2018: I started down the path of getting tested via my PCP so that i would ideally have something to take with us to the infertility doctor. He referred my to a urologist that was able to order a semen analysis.
* (Later in) November 2018: Had semen analysis. Clear issues from my side (see other section below)
* December 2018: Initial Fertility Doc visit where we shared the knowledge of my issues. He ordered blood testing for both, genetic testing for me, a follow up for me with a more infertility specializing urologist and a HSG for my wife.
* January 2019: Blood + Genetic testing done (not sure of results). Follow up with urologist yielded more bad news (below). Still outstanding are the HSG for my wife (tomorrow) and our follow up with the fertility doc (Monday).

To date, we're not aware of any issues my wife is having but that should be better confirmed on Monday. Here is what is going on with me: 

1. The semen analysis revealed issues with concentration/motility impacting my overall sperm count. They had to extract a 10ul drop for further examination (I think he said in a centrifuge) and saw that there were ""rare motile and many non-motile sperm"". I guess my count isn't necessarily 0, but it's also not very much. 
2. At urology follow up today the doctor did a physical examination and feels that based testicle size my issue is related to sperm production as opposed to a blockage of some sort.

I have two recommended paths forwarded, both as input to likely IVF:

1. Testicular Biopsy for extraction
2. Clomid + L - Carnitine + Folic Acid for 3 months and a follow up semen analysis. Also suggested the standard no drinking/no smoking/healthy eating and regular exercise. He didn't sound optimistic about this approach but I want to try it all the same. We're still relatively young, need to save IVF money anyhow, and #1 sounds like absolute hell. 

If you're still reading this novel, I guess I'd really just know:

1. If anyone has had any success whatsoever in actually conceiving with these specific/similar challenges?
2. Is a Testicular Biopsy as painful as he described it?
3. Has anyone with similar stats done the medication regimen I described with actual results?

Thank you in advance. Blessed to have found a community where I can feel kind of normal. This whole ordeal is immensely emasculating and terrifying.

Abstract
BACKGROUND
Endometrial scratching (with the use of a pipelle biopsy) is a technique proposed to facilitate embryo implantation and increase the probability of pregnancy in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF).

METHODS
We conducted a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial. Eligible women were undergoing IVF (fresh-embryo or frozen-embryo transfer), with no recent exposure to disruptive intrauterine instrumentation (e.g., hysteroscopy). Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endometrial scratching (by pipelle biopsy between day 3 of the cycle preceding the embryo-transfer cycle and day 3 of the embryo-transfer cycle) or no intervention. The primary outcome was live birth.

RESULTS
A total of 1364 women underwent randomization. The frequency of live birth was 180 of 690 women (26.1%) in the endometrial-scratch group and 176 of 674 women (26.1%) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.27). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage. The median score for pain from endometrial scratching (on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse pain) was 3.5 (interquartile range, 1.9 to 6.0).

CONCLUSIONS
Endometrial scratching did not result in a higher rate of live birth than no intervention among women undergoing IVF. (Funded by the University of Auckland and others; PIP Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12614000626662.)

The success rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) remains modest; the probability of live birth is approximately 25 to 30% per initiated cycle.1-3 Endometrial scratching, which involves the obtaining of an endometrial-biopsy sample with a sampler such as the pipelle, has been proposed to increase the success rate of IVF. It has been postulated that the endometrial injury, or “scratch,” that results from the biopsy may facilitate embryo implantation by inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms.4-7

Pooled results from randomized trials have suggested benefit from this procedure, especially in women in whom implantation had failed previously.8 However, many trials have had methodologic limitations, including small size, and unclear methods of randomization and concealment of trial-group assignments; some have been published only as conference abstracts.9-12 One of the larger trials with a robust design showed a lack of benefit from endometrial scratching; a subgroup analysis suggested lower rates of pregnancy with this intervention than with no intervention among women in whom implantation had failed repeatedly.10,13 Despite conflicting evidence, a recent survey showed that 83% of fertility clinicians in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand offer or recommend endometrial scratching, which can cost patients as much as £400 (approximately $500 U.S.).14

We conducted the Pipelle for Pregnancy (PIP) trial to investigate whether endometrial scratching, delivered by an endometrial pipelle biopsy, increases the probability of live birth in women undergoing IVF.

Methods
TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
The trial protocol was published previously15 and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Women were eligible if they were planning IVF with their own oocytes (stimulated IVF cycle with planned fresh-embryo transfer, or frozen-embryo transfer with the use of stored embryos); the choice of stimulation protocol and luteal-phase protocol was according to the standard practice at each clinic. Women were excluded if they were not planning an embryo transfer (e.g., fertility preservation or plan to freeze all embryos for storage [freeze-all cycle]), had any contraindication to pipelle biopsy (e.g., vaginismus), or had undergone any disruptive intrauterine procedures within 3 months before the start of IVF (specifically, hysteroscopy, sonohysterography, hysterosalpingography, laparoscopy, surgically managed miscarriage, or endometrial biopsy). Less disruptive procedures, such as embryo transfer and intrauterine insemination, were permitted. All women provided written informed consent.

The trial was approved by Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health, New Zealand, and subsequently by the relevant ethics committees at all sites internationally. The first two authors, the fourth author, and the fifth author vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.

RANDOMIZATION
An online, third-party data-collection and randomization system was used to confirm participant eligibility and ensure concealment of trial-group assignments before randomization. Randomization was performed in a 1:1 ratio with the use of block randomization of two different sizes between 6 and 16 repeating in random order, with stratification according to recruiting site and according to whether a fresh-embryo transfer or frozen-embryo transfer was planned. Women underwent randomization on or after day 1 of the cycle that preceded the IVF cycle. After randomization, trial personnel and participants were aware of the trial-group assignments (i.e., no blinding).

INTERVENTION
Women who were assigned to endometrial scratching were scheduled for an endometrial scratch between day 3 of the cycle preceding the IVF cycle and day 3 of the IVF cycle. Day 1 of the IVF cycle was defined as the first day of the menstrual period or withdrawal bleeding, or the day before the first day of stimulation in the case of no bleeding. This time interval was based on previous studies showing benefit from this intervention.16,17

A clinician performed the endometrial-scratch procedures using a pipelle, a plastic biopsy catheter approximately 3 mm in diameter (e.g., Pipelle de Cornier, Laboratoire CCD, France). Participants were advised to attend with a full bladder and to take pain medication before the procedure, according to clinic protocols. The procedure was carried out as described previously.15 If it was not possible to insert the pipelle into the uterus, a tenaculum, local anesthetic, and cervical dilatation were permitted, or a second attempt was scheduled for another day or with a different clinician (or both). The procedure was discontinued at the participant’s request (e.g., because of pain or discomfort) or if the clinician was unable to pass the pipelle. Immediately after the procedure, participants were asked to record the pain experienced during the procedure on a visual analogue scale (scores ranged from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse pain). Participants were contacted within 1 week and asked whether they had any vaginal bleeding the day after the procedure. Participants who were assigned to the control group received standard care.

OUTCOMES
The primary outcome was live birth per randomly assigned woman; we included all participants in their randomly assigned groups and adjusted for stratification variables.18 Secondary outcomes were ongoing pregnancy (viable pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation), clinical pregnancy (one or more gestational sacs at approximately 6 weeks of gestation), multiple pregnancy (two or more gestational sacs or heartbeats at the stage of clinical pregnancy), ectopic pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy (defined as a serum level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin of >25 mIU per milliliter or a positive home urinary pregnancy test), miscarriage, stillbirth, pregnancy termination, pain during the procedure, bleeding the day after the procedure, and maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Data were also collected on pregnancy outcomes of delayed cycles and (unplanned) freeze-all cycles followed by frozen-embryo transfer if the embryo transfer occurred within 3 calendar months from the expected day 1 of the IVF cycle. Only the result of the first embryo transfer was captured. In addition, any spontaneous pregnancy that occurred before an embryo transfer and within the 3-month window was recorded.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Originally, the sample size was calculated on the basis of the anticipated effect size of a 16-percentage-point difference between the two groups for the outcome of live birth, as reported in a Cochrane review.19 At 90% power and a two-sided significance level of 5% and with an adjustment (doubling of the sample) to permit detection of subgroup effects, a sample of 840 women was required.15

After the publication of an updated Cochrane review that suggested that the anticipated effect of the intervention might differ between women in whom implantation had failed repeatedly and women in whom it had not, the sample-size calculation was updated on the basis of anticipated effects of the intervention in these two subgroups.8 For the outcome of live birth and at 80% power and a two-sided significance level of 5%, 280 participants with at least two previous unsuccessful transfers were required to detect a between-group difference in live-birth rates of 15 percentage points (31% vs. 16%), and 1002 women with no more than one previous transfer were required to detect a difference of 8 percentage points (33% vs. 25%). Therefore, the trial aimed to recruit a minimum of 1300 women in total (650 per group, at a 1:1 ratio). The primary analyses were planned for the total trial population; post hoc, this would mean that the trial had 80% power to detect a between-group difference in live-birth rates of 7 percentage points. The sample-size amendment was implemented without knowledge of any interim results in the ongoing trial.

Odds ratios were calculated both with and without covariate adjustment for the stratification variables (site and fresh-embryo or frozen-embryo transfer), with 95% confidence intervals and P values. The adjusted analysis was the primary analysis. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted according to fresh-embryo or frozen-embryo transfer, implantation failure (≥2 or ≤1 previous unsuccessful transfers), recruiting center, cause of subfertility, duration of subfertility, exposure to nondisruptive instrumentation (yes or no), and use of contraceptive pills for IVF scheduling (yes or no). We performed these analyses by including an interaction term between trial-group assignment and each covariate in a multivariable logistic regression. Logistic regression was used to investigate prespecified predictors of live birth in the endometrial-scratch group: timing of scratch in relation to embryo transfer and pain during the procedure. Linear regression was used to investigate prespecified predictors of pain in the endometrial-scratch group: previous cervical surgery, use of contraceptive pills for IVF scheduling, and use of a tenaculum. Confidence intervals for secondary outcomes and subgroups were not adjusted for multiple testing, and inferences that are drawn from the intervals may not be reproducible.

The primary analyses were performed with the use of R software20 and conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, including all women in their randomly assigned groups. Missing data were not imputed for any variables; however, the four women who withdrew and the one woman lost to follow-up were assumed not to have conceived.

Two post hoc per-protocol (treatment-received) analyses were performed, which attempted to estimate the effect of receiving endometrial scratching, with the use of randomization as an instrumental variable. These analyses were conducted in reaction to nonadherence observed in the trial, including differences in the proportions of women undergoing embryo transfer between the trial groups. In these analyses, the effect of receiving the scratch was estimated in the whole group and in the subgroup of women who underwent embryo transfer. Both analyses were performed by fitting bivariate probit models with robust standard errors in Stata software.21

PARTICIPANTS

Assessment, Randomization, and Analysis.
Table 1.

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Participants.
Participants were recruited during a 3-year period from June 2014 through June 2017 at 13 sites in five countries (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). In total, 3627 women were assessed for eligibility, and 1364 underwent randomization, 690 to the endometrial-scratch group and 674 to the control group (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Approximately 25% of the participants had undergone two or more previous unsuccessful embryo transfers.

Table 2.

Characteristics of Fresh IVF Cycle.
Table 3.

Characteristics of Frozen Embryo Transfer Cycle.
Cycle characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 2 and Table 3). In total, 1118 participants (82.0%) underwent embryo transfer, 586 (84.9%) in the endometrial-scratch group and 532 (78.9%) in the control group. Of 133 women undergoing an unplanned freeze-all cycle, 67 underwent a frozen-embryo transfer within the 3-month window permitted by the trial protocol (Figure 1). In addition, there were 2 women in the endometrial-scratch group whose frozen embryo did not survive thawing and who initiated a new IVF cycle with fresh-embryo transfer within the 3-month window. In total, 20 women became pregnant during the trial without IVF (17 women before starting their IVF cycle, 2 women who were discovered to be pregnant after starting their IVF medication but before oocyte retrieval, and 1 woman during a freeze-all cycle) (Figure 1).

ENDOMETRIAL SCRATCH
Of the 690 women assigned to endometrial scratching, the procedure was performed in 641 (92.9%), either on the first or second attempt (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The procedure was not attempted in 28 women assigned to this intervention, and it was discontinued in 19 cases owing to difficulty navigating the cervical canal and in 1 case owing to participant request. (Information regarding completion of the procedure was missing for 1 participant.) The median time between endometrial scratch and embryo transfer was 35 days (interquartile range, 22 to 39).

Women who underwent the procedure had a median pain score of 3.5 on a 10-point scale (interquartile range, 1.9 to 6.0); 37 women had a score of 0, and 6 women had a score of 10. There were 14 adverse reactions: 5 women were recorded as having experienced excessive pain, including 1 woman who presented to the emergency department owing to intense pain after the endometrial scratch, which had been conducted concurrently with a sonohysterogram procedure; 7 women fainted or felt very dizzy or nauseous after the procedure; and 2 women had excessive bleeding. These outcomes were subjectively assessed by the clinician performing the procedure. There were no reported cases of infection or other adverse events after the procedure. The procedural information was not captured for 8 participants in the control group who underwent endometrial scratching despite their trial-group assignment.

PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS
In addition to the 36 participants whose treatment was inconsistent with their assignment, 5 women underwent a disruptive instrumentation procedure within 3 months before initiating the IVF cycle (four sonohysterogram procedures and one hysterosalpingogram procedure), including 4 in the endometrial-scratch group and 1 in the control group. A total of 4 women withdrew from the trial, all for personal reasons (Figure 1). Demographic data were recorded for these women, but no further information was collected.

OUTCOMES
Table 4.

Trial Outcomes (Intention-to-Treat Analysis).
The live-birth rate was 180 of 690 (26.1%) in the endometrial-scratch group and 176 of 674 (26.1%) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.27; P=0.97; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.27; P=0.99) (Table 4). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage (Table 4). The results of the per-protocol analyses were similar to those of the primary analysis (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).

There was no evidence of any benefit from endometrial scratching among women in whom implantation had failed at least twice or among women in whom it had failed no more than once (estimated interaction odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.15; P=0.14) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). In addition, there were no significant interactions for any other subgroups for the outcome of live birth (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Neither the days between endometrial scratch and embryo transfer nor pain during the procedure was a predictor of live birth in the endometrial-scratch group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). In women undergoing endometrial scratching, pain was unrelated to previous cervical surgery or use of contraceptive pills for IVF scheduling but appeared to be slightly greater with the use of a tenaculum (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Discussion
The PIP trial was a large, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized trial of endometrial scratching as compared with no procedure before an IVF cycle. Endometrial scratching did not result in higher rates of the primary outcome of live birth than no procedure in intention-to-treat or in post hoc per-protocol analyses.

Subgroup analyses did not identify any populations of women who might benefit. There was no benefit observed in the subgroup of women in whom implantation had failed at least twice; the point estimate in an interaction analysis was in the direction of lower effectiveness of endometrial scratching in these women than in women in whom implantation had failed no more than once, as was reported in another large trial,13 and the confidence interval suggests that a benefit is unlikely.

The median pain score during the procedure was 3.5 of 10, and there were 14 adverse reactions. Additional potential harms of endometrial scratching include cost and inconvenience; most procedures were scheduled as an extra clinic appointment, and in practice an endometrial scratch costs patients up to £400 when offered in a private fertility setting.14

The results from multiple previous trials have been inconsistent but have generally favored endometrial scratching in women undergoing IVF.8,22-26 Many of these studies were small and underpowered or suffered from a high risk of bias, such as lack of concealment of trial-group assignments (which is known to be associated with exaggeration of treatment effect)27,28 and other biases (e.g., stopping early for a positive effect).8 The current trial had a large sample size, concealed trial-group assignments to limit the potential for selection bias, and had minimal attrition; four women withdrew from the trial, and the pregnancy outcome of only one other participant is unknown. The rate of single-embryo transfer was similarly high in both groups in this trial, which reflects current recommended practice and limits the potential for performance bias. Furthermore, the pragmatic trial design and the recruitment in 13 fertility clinics across five countries improves the generalizability of the results. Despite availability of the procedure privately in many fertility centers,14 only eight participants in the control group are known to have had the endometrial scratch during the trial and 92.9% of the women in the endometrial-scratch group completed the procedure.

An important limitation of our trial is the lack of blinding. It is possible that knowledge of trial-group assignments may have contributed to the higher proportion of participants in the control group than in the endometrial-scratch group who did not undergo embryo transfer. There were imbalances favoring the endometrial-scratch group both in the proportion of women starting an IVF cycle and in the number of women with embryos available for transfer after oocyte retrieval (Figure 1). Women in the endometrial-scratch group may have been more likely to start their cycle in order to capitalize on their exposure to the endometrial scratch. However, results were materially unchanged in a per-protocol analysis. Another potential limitation is that the definition of recurrent implantation failure in this trial was two or more previous unsuccessful transfers and did not involve consideration of the stage or quality of the transferred embryos.29 Last, because the outcomes of pain and bleeding were captured only in the endometrial-scratch group, it is not possible to compare the frequency of these adverse events between trial groups.

In conclusion, in this large, multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial of endometrial scratching before IVF, endometrial scratching did not result in a higher live-birth rate than no endometrial scratching. The procedure was associated with a mild amount of pain and a small number of adverse events.

Endometrial scratching did not result in a higher rate of live birth than no intervention among women undergoing IVF. (Funded by the University of Auckland and others; PIP Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12614000626662.)</p>

<p>The success rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) remains modest; the probability of live birth is approximately 25 to 30% per initiated cycle.1-3 Endometrial scratching, which involves the obtaining of an endometrial-biopsy sample with a sampler such as the pipelle, has been proposed to increase the success rate of IVF.

TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
The trial protocol was published previously15 and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Women were eligible if they were planning IVF with their own oocytes (stimulated IVF cycle with planned fresh-embryo transfer, or frozen-embryo transfer with the use of stored embryos); the choice of stimulation protocol and luteal-phase protocol was according to the standard practice at each clinic. Women were excluded if they were not planning an embryo transfer (e.g., fertility preservation or plan to freeze all embryos for storage [freeze-all cycle]), had any contraindication to pipelle biopsy (e.g., vaginismus), or had undergone any disruptive intrauterine procedures within 3 months before the start of IVF (specifically, hysteroscopy, sonohysterography, hysterosalpingography, laparoscopy, surgically managed miscarriage, or endometrial biopsy). Less disruptive procedures, such as embryo transfer and intrauterine insemination, were permitted. All women provided written informed consent.</p>

<p>The trial was approved by Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health, New Zealand, and subsequently by the relevant ethics committees at all sites internationally. The first two authors, the fourth author, and the fifth author vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.</p>

<p>RANDOMIZATION
An online, third-party data-collection and randomization system was used to confirm participant eligibility and ensure concealment of trial-group assignments before randomization. Randomization was performed in a 1:1 ratio with the use of block randomization of two different sizes between 6 and 16 repeating in random order, with stratification according to recruiting site and according to whether a fresh-embryo transfer or frozen-embryo transfer was planned. Women underwent randomization on or after day 1 of the cycle that preceded the IVF cycle. After randomization, trial personnel and participants were aware of the trial-group assignments (i.e., no blinding).</p>

<p>INTERVENTION
Women who were assigned to endometrial scratching were scheduled for an endometrial scratch between day 3 of the cycle preceding the IVF cycle and day 3 of the IVF cycle. Day 1 of the IVF cycle was defined as the first day of the menstrual period or withdrawal bleeding, or the day before the first day of stimulation in the case of no bleeding. This time interval was based on previous studies showing benefit from this intervention.16,17</p>

<p>A clinician performed the endometrial-scratch procedures using a pipelle, a plastic biopsy catheter approximately 3 mm in diameter (e.g., Pipelle de Cornier, Laboratoire CCD, France). Participants were advised to attend with a full bladder and to take pain medication before the procedure, according to clinic protocols. The procedure was carried out as described previously.15 If it was not possible to insert the pipelle into the uterus, a tenaculum, local anesthetic, and cervical dilatation were permitted, or a second attempt was scheduled for another day or with a different clinician (or both). The procedure was discontinued at the participant’s request (e.g., because of pain or discomfort) or if the clinician was unable to pass the pipelle. Immediately after the procedure, participants were asked to record the pain experienced during the procedure on a visual analogue scale (scores ranged from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse pain). Participants were contacted within 1 week and asked whether they had any vaginal bleeding the day after the procedure. Participants who were assigned to the control group received standard care.</p>

<p>OUTCOMES
The primary outcome was live birth per randomly assigned woman; we included all participants in their randomly assigned groups and adjusted for stratification variables.18 Secondary outcomes were ongoing pregnancy (viable pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation), clinical pregnancy (one or more gestational sacs at approximately 6 weeks of gestation), multiple pregnancy (two or more gestational sacs or heartbeats at the stage of clinical pregnancy), ectopic pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy (defined as a serum level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin of &gt;25 mIU per milliliter or a positive home urinary pregnancy test), miscarriage, stillbirth, pregnancy termination, pain during the procedure, bleeding the day after the procedure, and maternal and neonatal outcomes.</p>

<p>Data were also collected on pregnancy outcomes of delayed cycles and (unplanned) freeze-all cycles followed by frozen-embryo transfer if the embryo transfer occurred within 3 calendar months from the expected day 1 of the IVF cycle. Only the result of the first embryo transfer was captured. In addition, any spontaneous pregnancy that occurred before an embryo transfer and within the 3-month window was recorded.</p>

<p>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Originally, the sample size was calculated on the basis of the anticipated effect size of a 16-percentage-point difference between the two groups for the outcome of live birth, as reported in a Cochrane review.19 At 90% power and a two-sided significance level of 5% and with an adjustment (doubling of the sample) to permit detection of subgroup effects, a sample of 840 women was required.15</p>

<p>After the publication of an updated Cochrane review that suggested that the anticipated effect of the intervention might differ between women in whom implantation had failed repeatedly and women in whom it had not, the sample-size calculation was updated on the basis of anticipated effects of the intervention in these two subgroups.8 For the outcome of live birth and at 80% power and a two-sided significance level of 5%, 280 participants with at least two previous unsuccessful transfers were required to detect a between-group difference in live-birth rates of 15 percentage points (31% vs. 16%), and 1002 women with no more than one previous transfer were required to detect a difference of 8 percentage points (33% vs. 25%). Therefore, the trial aimed to recruit a minimum of 1300 women in total (650 per group, at a 1:1 ratio). The primary analyses were planned for the total trial population; post hoc, this would mean that the trial had 80% power to detect a between-group difference in live-birth rates of 7 percentage points. The sample-size amendment was implemented without knowledge of any interim results in the ongoing trial.</p>

<p>Odds ratios were calculated both with and without covariate adjustment for the stratification variables (site and fresh-embryo or frozen-embryo transfer), with 95% confidence intervals and P values. The adjusted analysis was the primary analysis. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted according to fresh-embryo or frozen-embryo transfer, implantation failure (≥2 or ≤1 previous unsuccessful transfers), recruiting center, cause of subfertility, duration of subfertility, exposure to nondisruptive instrumentation (yes or no), and use of contraceptive pills for IVF scheduling (yes or no). We performed these analyses by including an interaction term between trial-group assignment and each covariate in a multivariable logistic regression. Logistic regression was used to investigate prespecified predictors of live birth in the endometrial-scratch group: timing of scratch in relation to embryo transfer and pain during the procedure. Linear regression was used to investigate prespecified predictors of pain in the endometrial-scratch group: previous cervical surgery, use of contraceptive pills for IVF scheduling, and use of a tenaculum. Confidence intervals for secondary outcomes and subgroups were not adjusted for multiple testing, and inferences that are drawn from the intervals may not be reproducible.</p>

<p>The primary analyses were performed with the use of R software20 and conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, including all women in their randomly assigned groups. Missing data were not imputed for any variables; however, the four women who withdrew and the one woman lost to follow-up were assumed not to have conceived.</p>

<p>Two post hoc per-protocol (treatment-received) analyses were performed, which attempted to estimate the effect of receiving endometrial scratching, with the use of randomization as an instrumental variable. These analyses were conducted in reaction to nonadherence observed in the trial, including differences in the proportions of women undergoing embryo transfer between the trial groups. In these analyses, the effect of receiving the scratch was estimated in the whole group and in the subgroup of women who underwent embryo transfer. Both analyses were performed by fitting bivariate probit models with robust standard errors in Stata software.21</p>

<p>Assessment, Randomization, and Analysis.
Table 1.</p>

<p>Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Participants.
Participants were recruited during a 3-year period from June 2014 through June 2017 at 13 sites in five countries (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). In total, 3627 women were assessed for eligibility, and 1364 underwent randomization, 690 to the endometrial-scratch group and 674 to the control group (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Approximately 25% of the participants had undergone two or more previous unsuccessful embryo transfers.</p>

<p>Table 2.</p>

<p>Characteristics of Fresh IVF Cycle.
Table 3.</p>

<p>Characteristics of Frozen Embryo Transfer Cycle.
Cycle characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 2 and Table 3). In total, 1118 participants (82.0%) underwent embryo transfer, 586 (84.9%) in the endometrial-scratch group and 532 (78.9%) in the control group. Of 133 women undergoing an unplanned freeze-all cycle, 67 underwent a frozen-embryo transfer within the 3-month window permitted by the trial protocol (Figure 1). In addition, there were 2 women in the endometrial-scratch group whose frozen embryo did not survive thawing and who initiated a new IVF cycle with fresh-embryo transfer within the 3-month window. In total, 20 women became pregnant during the trial without IVF (17 women before starting their IVF cycle, 2 women who were discovered to be pregnant after starting their IVF medication but before oocyte retrieval, and 1 woman during a freeze-all cycle) (Figure 1).</p>

<p>ENDOMETRIAL SCRATCH
Of the 690 women assigned to endometrial scratching, the procedure was performed in 641 (92.9%), either on the first or second attempt (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The procedure was not attempted in 28 women assigned to this intervention, and it was discontinued in 19 cases owing to difficulty navigating the cervical canal and in 1 case owing to participant request. (Information regarding completion of the procedure was missing for 1 participant.) The median time between endometrial scratch and embryo transfer was 35 days (interquartile range, 22 to 39).</p>

<p>Women who underwent the procedure had a median pain score of 3.5 on a 10-point scale (interquartile range, 1.9 to 6.0); 37 women had a score of 0, and 6 women had a score of 10. There were 14 adverse reactions: 5 women were recorded as having experienced excessive pain, including 1 woman who presented to the emergency department owing to intense pain after the endometrial scratch, which had been conducted concurrently with a sonohysterogram procedure; 7 women fainted or felt very dizzy or nauseous after the procedure; and 2 women had excessive bleeding. These outcomes were subjectively assessed by the clinician performing the procedure. There were no reported cases of infection or other adverse events after the procedure. The procedural information was not captured for 8 participants in the control group who underwent endometrial scratching despite their trial-group assignment.</p>

<p>PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS
In addition to the 36 participants whose treatment was inconsistent with their assignment, 5 women underwent a disruptive instrumentation procedure within 3 months before initiating the IVF cycle (four sonohysterogram procedures and one hysterosalpingogram procedure), including 4 in the endometrial-scratch group and 1 in the control group. A total of 4 women withdrew from the trial, all for personal reasons (Figure 1). Demographic data were recorded for these women, but no further information was collected.</p>

<p>OUTCOMES
Table 4.</p>

<p>Trial Outcomes (Intention-to-Treat Analysis).
The live-birth rate was 180 of 690 (26.1%) in the endometrial-scratch group and 176 of 674 (26.1%) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.27; P=0.97; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.27; P=0.99) (Table 4). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage (Table 4). The results of the per-protocol analyses were similar to those of the primary analysis (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).</p>

<p>There was no evidence of any benefit from endometrial scratching among women in whom implantation had failed at least twice or among women in whom it had failed no more than once (estimated interaction odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.15; P=0.14) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). In addition, there were no significant interactions for any other subgroups for the outcome of live birth (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Neither the days between endometrial scratch and embryo transfer nor pain during the procedure was a predictor of live birth in the endometrial-scratch group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). In women undergoing endometrial scratching, pain was unrelated to previous cervical surgery or use of contraceptive pills for IVF scheduling but appeared to be slightly greater with the use of a tenaculum (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).</p>

<p>Discussion
The PIP trial was a large, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized trial of endometrial scratching as compared with no procedure before an IVF cycle. Endometrial scratching did not result in higher rates of the primary outcome of live birth than no procedure in intention-to-treat or in post hoc per-protocol analyses.</p>

<p>Subgroup analyses did not identify any populations of women who might benefit. There was no benefit observed in the subgroup of women in whom implantation had failed at least twice; the point estimate in an interaction analysis was in the direction of lower effectiveness of endometrial scratching in these women than in women in whom implantation had failed no more than once, as was reported in another large trial,13 and the confidence interval suggests that a benefit is unlikely.</p>

<p>The median pain score during the procedure was 3.5 of 10, and there were 14 adverse reactions. Additional potential harms of endometrial scratching include cost and inconvenience; most procedures were scheduled as an extra clinic appointment, and in practice an endometrial scratch costs patients up to £400 when offered in a private fertility setting.14</p>

<p>The results from multiple previous trials have been inconsistent but have generally favored endometrial scratching in women undergoing IVF.8,22-26 Many of these studies were small and underpowered or suffered from a high risk of bias, such as lack of concealment of trial-group assignments (which is known to be associated with exaggeration of treatment effect)27,28 and other biases (e.g., stopping early for a positive effect).8 The current trial had a large sample size, concealed trial-group assignments to limit the potential for selection bias, and had minimal attrition; four women withdrew from the trial, and the pregnancy outcome of only one other participant is unknown. The rate of single-embryo transfer was similarly high in both groups in this trial, which reflects current recommended practice and limits the potential for performance bias. Furthermore, the pragmatic trial design and the recruitment in 13 fertility clinics across five countries improves the generalizability of the results. Despite availability of the procedure privately in many fertility centers,14 only eight participants in the control group are known to have had the endometrial scratch during the trial and 92.9% of the women in the endometrial-scratch group completed the procedure.</p>

<p>An important limitation of our trial is the lack of blinding. It is possible that knowledge of trial-group assignments may have contributed to the higher proportion of participants in the control group than in the endometrial-scratch group who did not undergo embryo transfer. There were imbalances favoring the endometrial-scratch group both in the proportion of women starting an IVF cycle and in the number of women with embryos available for transfer after oocyte retrieval (Figure 1). Women in the endometrial-scratch group may have been more likely to start their cycle in order to capitalize on their exposure to the endometrial scratch. However, results were materially unchanged in a per-protocol analysis. Another potential limitation is that the definition of recurrent implantation failure in this trial was two or more previous unsuccessful transfers and did not involve consideration of the stage or quality of the transferred embryos.29 Last, because the outcomes of pain and bleeding were captured only in the endometrial-scratch group, it is not possible to compare the frequency of these adverse events between trial groups.</p>

<p>In conclusion, in this large, multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial of endometrial scratching before IVF, endometrial scratching did not result in a higher live-birth rate than no endometrial scratching. The procedure was associated with a mild amount of pain and a small number of adverse events.</p>

What is standard treatment for PCOS after being on metformin for 9 months? I’m 31 with a history of chemical pregnancies. I’ve done IVF 2x w/ a different partner and have some great info from that....

Background...
4 years ago I did 2 fresh & 1 frozen rounds of IVF because my ex DH had a vasectomy and I PCOS.  Total embryos 23.  4 implanted between the first fresh & frozen.  Both ended in chemical pregnancy with strong numbers in the first week.  The second IVF round we found out EVERY embryo had crazy bad genetics.  The drs basically told me and ex DH to not even try for a biokid because of how bad the genetics were.  The drs couldn’t explain it and were genuinely shocked at how bad the results were- I was 27, DH 38.   My egg quality was good, but when the embryo formed, the genes were bad.  Fast forward to now...

I’m remarried with a partner who has never had kids and has never had any fertility testing done.     I’ve been on metformin for 9 months at 1500mg  and my periods are still not regular. I’ve been off birth control since 7/2018.  We’ve been trying since 10/2018.  Nothing.  Just irregular periods.  I’m 31, he’s 30.  

My goal is to be aggressive because I do not trust my fertility to chance one bit. If I’m
Going to do IUI, i want injectables and progesterone shots.  My husband is very apprehensive about anything that’s not natural.  He’s agreed to IUI, but doesn’t like the idea of IVF.   I’m on the fence, knowing how much $$$ it is and how emotional it can be.  We both are comfortable with adoption and are thinking well probably do that.   

We have our first fertility appointment tomorrow with a new specialist.   Our old specialist deemed me fertile and sjectablesaid to just have sex every day.  Yeah right. My husband’s job is physical and having sex just twice a week is challenging. He’s also finishing up grad school.

If you had my history, what would you do? Would you go for IVF? Or would you try for the IUIs a couple rounds?  For those who don’t know, adoption can cost anywhere between $500-$20k.   Do you think it would be worth trying IVF if it comes to that or just going straight to adoption? I don’t want to waste money because we don’t have a lot to blow on this. Any thoughts and wisdom appreciated.

A little intro - been TTC for 6+ years, married for 8.5. We thought we’d spend the first 2 years as blissful newlyweds before starting a family. I laugh in the face of my naivete. In 2013 I was diagnosed with unexplained infertility and low ovarian reserve. We weren’t quite ready for IVF so we spent the next 4 years trying naturally along with 2 IUIs + medicated TI cycles. Had a bad experience with an IVF clinic in 2017 so I took some time off until last year, when we dove into IVF. Well, mini IVF.

My 2nd ER would have been today but I decided to cancel yesterday after my 3-4 follicles turned into 1. 

3 of the 5 cycles were cancelled due to poor response and 1 was converted to an IUI because I missed the cut off for the lab’s holiday blackout dates.

Silly me, thought it was extra early implantation bleeding until the full blown period came, despite $$$$$ for ultrasounds and blood tests.

I had a full IVF cycle a few months ago (retrieval in July/FET in Oct) and had assisted hatching done on the embryos. Assisted hatching was quoted to me in my retrieval treatment estimate at $1510 which I paid upon receipt. Tonight I got a notification that I owed $1510 for assisted hatching because apparently they performed assisted hatching during embryo culture in July and again on the day of FET in October. They applied the first $1510 to the one performed during embryo culture and are saying that the this bill is for the assisted hatching performed at transfer. Can you even do assisted hatching twice? Let alone bill twice for it in the same cycle?

Quick question for the hive mind. I had a full IVF cycle a few months ago (retrieval in July/FET in Oct) and had assisted hatching done on the embryos. Assisted hatching was quoted to me in my retrieval treatment estimate at $1510 which I paid upon receipt. Tonight I got a notification that I owed $1510 for assisted hatching because apparently they performed assisted hatching during embryo culture in July and again on the day of FET in October. They applied the first $1510 to the one performed during embryo culture and are saying that the this bill is for the assisted hatching performed at transfer. Can you even do assisted hatching twice? Let alone bill twice for it in the same cycle? Assisted hatching was only quoted to me as a part of my retrieval, not my FET cycle, and it seems insane that my doctor&#39;s office would bill twice for it. Anyone had this happen or just know more about assisted hatching than me?</p>

My husband and i have been doing infertility for a little over a month but have been dealing with negative pregnancy tests for about a year. I started a new job and we started infertility treatment at the same time so the whirlwind of emotions have been endless. We like the place we go to but scheduling has been difficult.  

Today was our first IUI. I have been keeping my new job in the loop and giving them the dates and times i will be late.
I rushed to my apt today and they told me they scheduled me at their other center which is in no way close to my work. 

Long story short a women saw how upset i was bc if i didn’t get it today it would be another month wasted and this is the 3rd Scheudling issue, she offered to give me her IUI spot bc she was off today. 
I’m so overwhelmed with emotion and couldn’t do anything but thank her.

Here you have the option of posting the outcome of your cycle (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread has now been combined with the Weekly Post-Beta Concerns & Discussion. For a whole week this thread will be posted for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, your pregnancy announcement is allowed in this thread, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top ""Read This"" sticky on the main page.** For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, r/InfertilityBabies. Of course, you are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences (and continue to support other community members) here on r/infertility.

I actually love my current clinic, but I’m beginning research because if our next two transfers fail (5 transfers of 7 blasts total) I’m most likely going to switch, or at least consult at a couple of others, before doing another retrieval. Since insurance requires a referral and medical records need to be sent, etc I’m starting early so I can hopefully avoid unnecessary delays. 

I do have insurance coverage so I’m limited somewhat by that in terms of which clinics and REs are in network (always weird when only 1 or 2 of many are in-network at the same clinic!) I also live in the Providence area and commute to Boston for work daily so there are a variety of logistical challenges that will inform our ultimate choice, including the location of a clinic’s embryology lab/where they do retrievals and transfers. 

I’m particularly interested to hear from anyone who has done PGS at a Boston area clinic and what PGS testing lab was used for those results (and cost!) My current clinic doesn’t really push PGS testing and is on the smaller side and at the end of the day while I like them I’m a little cautious that their embryology staff has less experience biopsying embryos than a larger clinic where more patients do PGS. I’ve also never heard of the lab they use for PGS testing which gives me pause.

And my husband is so fucking weak. All he does it talk about how this process is ""so hard"" for him. And he does fucking nothing. I take myself to most of my appointments. I have to take the injections. I'm the one that can't drink. I'm the one that calls insurance every week to follow up on claims. I do all of the research. All he has to do is fucking jizz in a little cup.

And now he's talking about how the idea of selectively picking some embryos over others makes him uncomfortable. My husband, the fucking scientist. Thinks that going through IVF is worse than having a chronically sick child (sickle cell disease). Man, what a hard fucking choice. 

I hate him. I sincerely do. 

We have six embryos on ice and I don't think I even want to transfer them. I don't want to be with someone who gives up so easily. He has no idea what it's like to work for anything. He's so fucking lazy. 

I'm not fucking adopting. I'm not taking care of any sick kids.

Men are so stupid and it's all just fun in games. So short-sighted. ""Why can't we have kids the fun way?"" He says. Because 2 minutes of your dick isn't worth me having to take a kid to the hospital every week.
