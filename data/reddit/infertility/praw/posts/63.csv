0,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi. 

I had a FET last Sunday, August 19th. My beta is scheduled for 3 days from now, 10 days total. 

Two days after, I had strong pulling and cramping that I thought could be implantation. 

A few days went by. I had minor heart burn and felt sick. But I knew it could simply be the progesterone tablets which I take vaginally. 

Then, on day 5, I had very light pink in my discharge. My heart stopped. It was all I could think about. 

By that time, I thought it was too late for implantation. So, on the morning of Saturday (start of day 7) I decided to try a non-digital HPT.  It came back negative. Completely. There was absolute no sign of a positive. Not even when I checked at night. 

Then, that night, I started having intense period cramps followed by darker stained discharge. They felt like normal period cramps. 

My periods have always been light until the last day or so and I have spotting for like, 7 days before the 3 day heavy period.

Anyway, I cried. I've read online how many people get a positive reading at 4dp. 

I am fairly certain it didn't take. 

Even today, I am having the cramps with the red discharge. 

But, my fiance isn't really buying all this. He thinks there's still a chance, that nothing has changed because I need to wait the full ten days before beta. 

The discharge stained red is getting worse, from very light to always in it now. My clinic is opened tomorrow. 


By this point, I am already considering how I want to do this again. Do I want to use the same clinic after I only ended up with one viable embryo and none to freeze? How do I finance it when my first cycle was paid for by government granted health? Am I even capable of ever becoming pregnant as I've never, ever seen even a smidge of a line on a HPT. 

I don't know what I want. I feel I cried enough. I just want to do the damn test and get the negative over it and stop hurting myself by thinking there is still a chance. I want to dust myself off and start again. 

Worse still, I made this struggle public on Facebook. Everyone recited; ""THINK POSITIVE"", but I feel like thinking positively doesn't do much and it's good to be realistic. 

I hate that I went online and looked up other results. I hate that I am still seeking reassurance on a public forum. 

I  am going to call them tomorrow, but they'll mostly humour me I think.

Since seeing our RE specialist earlier this month, I took a break from the thread trying to deal with my new emotions.

The day we went for our first RE consultation was CD 18 I woke that morning and was bleeding.  I had gotten a positive OPK on CD 17. It was a very late OPK from what I’ve had in the past (between cd 10-cd14) but I had started taking some additional supps so thought it was maybe that.  

The bleeding seemed light at first, but by the time we were ready to leave for our appointment I clearly needed a tampon.

At the appointment I told the RE about the bleeding and that I’d never had such a short cycle, but he thought given how my cycles were already on the shorter side some months (24-26 days) and my ovulation was on the early side it could be a true period.

I went on to bleed pretty heavily that day and the following day. So only two days of bleeding.

We scheduled another round of CD 3 blood work and vaginal ultrasound for two days later.
That day my nurse called to say that my bleeding wasn’t a period based off of the blood work and ultrasound.

It’s now CD 37 and while I’ve thought a few times I could feel a period starting, it’s still not here.  My nurse has stated that if it’s not arrived by cd 45 I’m to call to schedule a no period ultrasound and blood work and they will likely give me something to start my period.

At this point I’m just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, is there potentially something else happening to me outside of the DOR that I need to be concerned about?  Is there any voodoo I can enlist to bring on a period???? Who the heck even asked for that, lol.

Thanks so much!

The NHS has record that we’ve been actively TTC since April of 2017. They sent me for an ultrasound scan and blood work in October - these came back clear for PCOS. Cut a long story short I had to pay for private treatment in February of this year after going 4 months without a period. My doctor at my GP surgery was telling me this could be ‘normal’ for me and even advised I saw a female doctor next time as he had no idea what to suggest (what?)

In March I decided to go back to my surgery with news of my PCOS. They told me to come back in May if I wasn’t pregnant and they refer me for fertility testing. It was a lady doctor I saw this time and she mainly lectured me about my weight and then told me I was probably still ovulating despite not having a period. I called bullshit there and then and nope’d the fuck outta there.

I didn’t go back in May. I felt pretty damaged from my previous experiences on the NHS so I holed myself away.

We only have untested embryos and now are down to 2 Day 5s and 1 Day 6. All are showing as good quality. 

At the time of both transfers, lining would be balloon shaped with the thickest part at 7mm and thinnest near the top of the uterus at 6.6-6.9. First transfer, we medicated for 14 days to get where we needed to be; second time, 24 days. When both losses occurred, the signal was bleeding / spotting with clots. My clinic will not do beta tests unless forced. 

At our 2nd WTF Appt, the consultant suggested it could either be lining issues, embryo issues (ie both were abnormal), a combination of both, or just plan old bad luck. We will not risk trying to test our embryos currently in the freezer. In the UK, they only consider ""recurring miscarriage"" as 3+ losses, so they will not do a battery of tests until the next mc (which I think is rude and will fight this, fyi).

Note, AMH and TSH are all fine. I ovulate every cycle and cycles are regular. We started IVF + ICSI due to MFI (my husband has retrograde ejaculation, so semen goes to the bladder instead of out). 

So now that we've dispensed with the background, some questions:

Have any of you gone on viagra to treat lining issues and if so, what were your side effects? *We have concerns I'm being over medicated and my clinic does not do any blood tests during FET. In addition to introducing viagra, I will be on 2x Evorel estrogen patches every other day from start (vs staircasing to this) + 6 tablets (vs 3) of progynova each day.*

If you were or have been in a similar position (unexplained loss, untested embryos), would you transfer 2 good quality untested embryos? *We've been advised against this as I am 4'11 and other than some meat on my bones, I'm petite.*

Have you ever undertaken reproductive immunology testing? Or similarly, done intralipid infusions to combat potential antibodies fighting the embryo? 

Is there anything else you would consider looking at or testing for at this stage (short of another retrieval cycle with PGS testing)?

10,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, just looking for some advice.  I did IVF/ICSI/PGS in March which resulted in 2 normal embryos.  Did a FET in May which was a success until 13w1d at which point I had a very sudden and unexpected miscarriage of a healthy baby that we had just seen waving at us on ultrasound the day before.  I had to have a D&C that night and a blood transfusion, and after just minimal spotting for two weeks and then nothing, we thought we were on our way to zero HCG and transferring our last embryo.  

Almost four weeks after the D&C, I suddenly started gushing blood, and a trip to the ER found suspected retained products of conception.  This was confirmed by an ultrasound at my OBGYN the day after I was discharged from the hospital.  So I was sent home with a prescription for Cytotec with the hope of passing the tissue at home and avoiding a repeat D&C.  Unfortunately, the Cytotec failed to work in any capacity, so now I am scheduled for another ultrasound to confirm no progress on Monday and schedule a repeat D&C for Tuesday.

Here is the issue - I have spent today working myself into an anxious mess regarding scarring of my uterus.  I don’t know what to do or if there are even any options other than another D&C.  Maybe I already have scarring from the first D&C.  I was already an anxious mess about our only other embryo working and now the embryo may have additional hurdles to work through.

So, my questions (sorry for such a long background ramble):

Is the only option D&C if Cytotec failed?  My OBGYN indicated that if one dose doesn’t work, multiple doses aren’t going to work either.

Is she wrong?  Should I ask to try Cytotec again before another D&C?

What about a hysteroscopy?  Or hysteroscopy with D&C?

After this part is over and I’m back with my RE, will a SIS reveal any/all issues or should I ask for a hysteroscopy?  I only have one embryo left and my husband doesn’t want to go through IVF again, so I can’t really take a wait and see if it fails to then check things.

I am 36, and my husband is 44 with 2 grown children from before me.  We started TTC last October.  My cycle is like clockwork- ovulation is always confirmed through temping and OPKs.  I became pregnant quickly, then had an MMC in December (10 weeks).  After waiting a few cycles, I got pregnant quickly again in April, but it was a CP. 

I went to the RE for RPL testing.  We discovered that my AMH is currently 0.2.  It was pretty shocking.  Everything else was clear.  The RE suggested starting aggressive treatment immediately- it was a very brief conversation (I was still lying on the table after he had just finished my HSG when he dropped that bombshell) so we need to have a follow up conversation about next steps.  I also see a Naturopathic physician who specializes in preconception care, and I've got some recommendations from her already.  At this point I have decided to take steps to improve my egg quality and then try again on our own before seeking more involved treatment.

The RE suggested starting aggressive treatment immediately- it was a very brief conversation (I was still lying on the table after he had just finished my HSG when he dropped that bombshell) so we need to have a follow up conversation about next steps.  I also see a Naturopathic physician who specializes in preconception care, and I&#39;ve got some recommendations from her already.  At this point I have decided to take steps to improve my egg quality and then try again on our own before seeking more involved treatment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been active over at <a href=""/r/ttcafterloss"">r/ttcafterloss</a> and am grateful to have gained much knowledge there.  I would be interested in hearing from anyone here that&#39;s in a similar situation (it feels a bit strange to be over here, since I don&#39;t have a problem getting pregnant).  I have a lot to learn about treatment options and such so that&#39;s why I wanted to reach out over here.  Like I said earlier, it&#39;s been a real roller coaster and my opinions on a lot of things have changed and will likely change again.  Thanks for reading.</p>

25,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I had posted last night because I was beyond heartbroken thinking I had to let go of my 19 year old cat the same day as my FET.

Here’s a play by play that includes cat and FET details for those interested.

At about 6pm yesterday I knew I was losing her and you tell yourself things like, “ok, if tomorrow morning she still won’t eat, we’re going straight to the vet.”

She had t had water or food for a day.

She was neurotically restless but once I kicked the dogs out of the room and turned the lights off, she curled up in my arms and fell asleep.  I actually slept and at about 4am, I heard her drinking water, then heard her eating the food I left out.  Thought I was dreaming.  I wasn’t.

She was noticeably better this morning.  I still debated on whether now was better than later but she was HUNGRY and I got her meds in her and she looked happy.  Kitty gets to stick around.

I went to work, fairly stressful day.  I was super testy with anxiety on top of it.  Drank a ton of water to make sure my bladder was full.

Left, went to the IVF clinic.

Embryologist came in and we had a great discussion about my embryo.  It had thawed nicely and was opening up, which not all of them do (it was at this point that he showed me a picture of my high performing little octopus and I got REALLY excited).

See, I only have one.  So I’ve been trying to stay neutral because I have my life plan with a baby and my life plan without a biological child, neither of which are devastating to me.  I read up on this and learned how crushed so many women are when this route doesn’t work.  I am avoiding that to the best of my control.

They did an ultrasound on my belly to make sure my bladder was full (it was VERY full).

RE came in to confirm everything.

I changed and assumed the position.

Steps are:

Speculum 
Ultrasound on belly watching for catheter
Catheter insertion
Call the embryologist 
Then you sit there until they walk the embryo over
Embryologist and RE transfer the embryo to the catheter
You watch the ultrasound screen and possibly miss the “bubble” because who the hell can read those things

You get a photo
You get dressed
You pee a MAJOR pee

You go home and your kitty curls up on your belly and falls asleep.  

You take a nap with the kitty.

I’m a little crampy, which is normal.  

It still doesn’t feel real.  

Blood test on 9/4.

As for the cat, she’s still my baby.  The vet suspects a brain tumor so it’s just a matter of time but I’m spoiling her until then.

39,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Just wanted to hear your thoughts and maybe draw out any lurkers.

My husband and I have sickle cell trait. We never really tried for a ""free baby"" because I really wanted a healthy baby. I had a feeling I wouldn't have good luck. The chances of having a kid with the disease is supposed to be 25%, but throughout IVF, we've found 58% of our embryos to the have the disease.

I'm currently benched until I get my laprascopy done in October. In the meantime, we've been thinking about trying for a free baby. I'm just feeling kind of desperate and want to know if it's possible for me to have a kid at all.

My husband has no problem having a sick kid, but he's also not particularly good at thinking long-term or fully realizing what that entails until it comes around.

I've read that there are multiple types of sickle cell disease. The worst is SS. My lab reports show me to have 41% Hgb S, 56% Hgb A, and 2% Hgb A2. My husband is 26.3% Hgb S, 69% Hgb A, and 4% Hbg A2. He has alpha thalassemia. We both have 0% Hbg C. Hgb A is the normal blood type.

It seems to me that if our child did have sickle cell disease, it's most likely to be SS and not at all likely to be SC. But, I know nothing about blood genetics. Sickle Cell SS has a median life expectancy 42 and the worse symptoms, while SC has a median of 60 and few symptoms. The median in the United States is 78. I was also reading a [research paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832312/) (based in Brazil), and 37% of the participants had had a blood transfusion in the last year.

My husband has been trying to convince me that having a kid with sickle cell disease isn't that bad. But as I write it out, a life expectancy of 42 is nearly half of a normal life. I could very well out-live my child and that would really suck. So, that's off the table.

So I guess the next question is, do we try and selectively abort, if it comes to it? I'm not adverse to the idea (except that it will feel like a waste of time since we can't test until 10 weeks), but again, as I write this out, I realize my husband isn't into the idea. He's expressed interest in keeping a child if we get pregnant with a child with sickle cell disease but hasn't made it seem like a dealbreaker. But, as I write this, I am remembering that he's the type to never really give a hard stance until he has to. So, he'll waffle now, make it seem like he has a ""soft"" preference, then once I've scheduled an abortion, he'll start a super big argument. Claim that he didn't know how he felt until now. Then, my choice will be to ruin our relationship by having an abortion and upsetting my husband or ruin our relationship by keeping a sick kid that I will resent being forced to have.

Cool, so maybe no free baby for us after all.

Edit: Thanks everyone, for all your thoughtful responses. I actually showed my husband this thread and we agreed not to try for a fsb. He also didn't try to disagree with my last paragraph, which confirms my belief that selective abortion isn't for him.

<p>My husband and I have sickle cell trait. We never really tried for a &quot;free baby&quot; because I really wanted a healthy baby. I had a feeling I wouldn&#39;t have good luck. The chances of having a kid with the disease is supposed to be 25%, but throughout IVF, we&#39;ve found 58% of our embryos to the have the disease.</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently benched until I get my laprascopy done in October. In the meantime, we&#39;ve been thinking about trying for a free baby. I&#39;m just feeling kind of desperate and want to know if it&#39;s possible for me to have a kid at all.</p>

<p>My husband has no problem having a sick kid, but he&#39;s also not particularly good at thinking long-term or fully realizing what that entails until it comes around.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read that there are multiple types of sickle cell disease. The worst is SS. My lab reports show me to have 41% Hgb S, 56% Hgb A, and 2% Hgb A2. My husband is 26.3% Hgb S, 69% Hgb A, and 4% Hbg A2. He has alpha thalassemia. We both have 0% Hbg C. Hgb A is the normal blood type.</p>

Recently we began looking into IVF. As it stands, we aren't jumping to any conclusions but if we get nowhere within the next year we intend to pay for IVF. I spoke to a fertility specialist in the Czech Republic (Prague to be specific) who said with my medical history they could offer us a 3 cycle 100% refund plan for £9,100. This is incredibly cheap as opposed to the cost where we live. Plus, I like the peace of mind that we'd be refunded the money if no pregnancy came of it.


I've looked for flights and hotels to Prague and they're all fairly cheap. We could easily afford it. However, I'm wondering how long does the actual IVF process take? How long would we need to stay in Prague? I'm very new to this IVF business and have no idea. I've only just started doing my research tonight.

Long story short: good friend of mine got pregnant this summer. She never wanted kids, only started trying because everyone else was trying and she didn’t want to be left out. She even told me to my face after she announced that she wasn’t even sure if she wanted this to happen to her. Wtf? 

Anyway I’ve been childishly avoiding her for weeks. So today I decide to see how she’s doing and I didn’t mean for it to lead to a convo about my feelings but it did. I told her how I am happy for her but that I just can’t be that person for her to talk to about her pregnancy given my infertility issues and the struggles I’ve had this past spring with depression due to it. I told her we could still hang out and all but that I just needed some space and I loved her and supported her but if I didn’t show for her baby showers it’s not because I don’t care about her, it’s that I just can’t go to those things anymore. 

So she texts back that she’s devastated. That she’s so hurt she’s losing me. That she can’t believe I’m cutting her out. That if the roles were reversed she would treat me this way. That she was going to ask me and my husband to be guardians. That she was there for me when I needed her and why can’t I do the same for her. 

Ok am I out of line or what? I thought my responses were pretty honest and yet thoughtful. Help me out here, ladies. Thank you!

Husband and I saw his geneticist today. He suspects possible Klinefelter, which would mean TESE, PGD etc. Or it could be late-onset Kallman; if it's a known gene that means PGD, not one of the known genes still means electroejaculation at least, so probably still IVF (but possibly, possibly IUI).

As a geneticist, he doesn't order any but genetic tests. He always requests the PCP order any other tests. So he was all ""Patient's wife, have your PCP do the initial day 3 tests and refer to an RE so you can get ready in case you do need to do IVF.""

Well...turns out it *is* day 3.

Cue phone tag. I got on the phone to my PCP as we drove the 3 hours home from the geneticist. Receptionist #1 sends me to physician's assistant...'s voice mail box. Call back, receptionist #2 gets me the physician's assistant. Who gives my PCP the message...

...that...

""The patient's fertility doc wants these tests.""

So at 5:30 pm when the lab is about to close, receptionist #1 calls me back to tell me my PCP of course said the fertility doc should be the one to order those tests.

AUGH!

Dear PCP, I don't HAVE a fertility doc. My husband has a geneticist, who thinks I NEED a fertility doc. And also day 3 tests...but w/e.

Will call again tomorrow. (It's OK to do day 3 tests on day 4, isn't it? Geneticist said so, but he's a geneticist, not a fertility doc. Or should I just give up on the PCP and hope the gyno, who I am seeing for the first time in September (previously just used the PCP for gyno), will order these?)

This whole situation is just so frustrating. I'm already annoyed at life for delaying us to this point (first I was sick so we lost years to my diagnosis and treatment till I was 38; then ""just (try to) go have sex"" for a year as I aged from 38 to 39, dropping our chances of success even more). I'm in the ""just can't STAND to see ANY MORE TIME AT ALL get wasted"" stage. ...it is a stage, isn't it? Isn't it? :/

74,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I’ve had a rough few months. I’m hoping someone else here will understand too! It’s been over a year of actively TTC (12 cycles, but 13 months b/c 1 cycle he was in another country when I ovulated). I knew I might have a hard time because I’ve been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and estrogen dominance, and I’m overweight, but I’ve been working  losing weight on eating high fiber and low sugar and low cal, working out, prenatal vitamins, omega3s, getting my house in order. I thought it would happen eventually. I kept thinking it would happen before one anniversary or another, and definitely before I needed to book a specialist. Yet here I am. And lately it seems my life is slowly spiraling; I didn’t imagine how infertility would color every aspect of my life.

 My (senior but not THAT senior) died within 2 months of each other of unrelated causes, my friend tried to console me by sympathizing that it was like my babies had died. It made me realize that the cats may be the only “babies” I’ll ever have which has seriously complicated my mourning process. Meanwhile everyone I know is pregnant, my MIL asked me why we don’t have kids and if she should save my nephews baby stuff for me, and I’m mentally preparing myself to go through all the milestones of birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries with “I thought I would be pregnant by X date.”

And just to be clear, by everyone is pregnant, I mean it seems like all the fertile women in my life. My two best friends are pregnant and due in 3 months of each other. I’m hosting both their baby showers. My SIL is “surprise” pregnant at 43. My cousin just had her second. 3 of my homeless clients with substance abuse disorder are due within the next 5 months. Even every stranger on the internet seems pregnant! I’m happy for them, really! It’s just hard NOT to think about babies, when its everything that’s being talked about by all the people in my life. 

I’m just swimming in my own thoughts, feeling more and more hopeless as each cycle passes. One of my pregnant friends literally got pregnant the first time she tried, and WONT STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. I mean, I’ll talk baby shoes, showers, names, fruit size of the week, nursing, nurseries, maternity clothes, literally ANYTHING but conception. My life is peeing on sticks and getting concrete feedback of my inadequacy. She follows up with “why don’t you just adopt; I would have adopted if I couldn’t get pregnant [from someone who literally never worried that they wouldn’t get pregnant]?” I’m guessing a lot of people on this sub know that line; it’s definitely not for me or my husband. I’m relieved to throw myself into night classes, just so there’ll be a test I can pass. I’m saving money to see a RE, but it’ll be years before I can afford even a single round of  IVF, which my insurance doesn’t cover (nor will it be required to). 

The worst part is my husband acts like he doesn’t care about the infertility at all, and flat out won’t talk about it, and jokes he only cares that he’s getting to have sex. He won’t look at a website, won’t take supplements, agrees to stop smoking pot and cut back on beer (but doesn’t), he doesn’t want to know about my cycle, he’s not interested in seeing the specialist with me. I don’t know if it’s bravado, if he’s afraid I’ll cry if I bring it up, if he’s afraid he’s the one who’s infertile, or if he secretly doesn’t want kids and is afraid Ill divorce him and stop paying his bills if he’s honest. It makes me feel so lonely  and paranoid. 

I’m working to remind myself how lucky I am. Other than the infertility thing, my husband is gentle and supportive and helps me a lot, I have a supportive family, I have a job a like and I’m going to night school for an even better one, and I’m trying to figure out what an acceptable future without kids can look like.

I’m hoping someone else here will understand too! It’s been over a year of actively TTC (12 cycles, but 13 months b/c 1 cycle he was in another country when I ovulated). I knew I might have a hard time because I’ve been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and estrogen dominance, and I’m overweight, but I’ve been working  losing weight on eating high fiber and low sugar and low cal, working out, prenatal vitamins, omega3s, getting my house in order. I thought it would happen eventually. I kept thinking it would happen before one anniversary or another, and definitely before I needed to book a specialist. Yet here I am. And lately it seems my life is slowly spiraling; I didn’t imagine how infertility would color every aspect of my life.</p>

<p>My (senior but not THAT senior) died within 2 months of each other of unrelated causes, my friend tried to console me by sympathizing that it was like my babies had died. It made me realize that the cats may be the only “babies” I’ll ever have which has seriously complicated my mourning process. Meanwhile everyone I know is pregnant, my MIL asked me why we don’t have kids and if she should save my nephews baby stuff for me, and I’m mentally preparing myself to go through all the milestones of birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries with “I thought I would be pregnant by X date.”</p>

<p>And just to be clear, by everyone is pregnant, I mean it seems like all the fertile women in my life. My two best friends are pregnant and due in 3 months of each other. I’m hosting both their baby showers. My SIL is “surprise” pregnant at 43. My cousin just had her second. 3 of my homeless clients with substance abuse disorder are due within the next 5 months. Even every stranger on the internet seems pregnant! I’m happy for them, really! It’s just hard NOT to think about babies, when its everything that’s being talked about by all the people in my life. </p>

<p>I’m just swimming in my own thoughts, feeling more and more hopeless as each cycle passes. One of my pregnant friends literally got pregnant the first time she tried, and WONT STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. I mean, I’ll talk baby shoes, showers, names, fruit size of the week, nursing, nurseries, maternity clothes, literally ANYTHING but conception. My life is peeing on sticks and getting concrete feedback of my inadequacy. She follows up with “why don’t you just adopt; I would have adopted if I couldn’t get pregnant [from someone who literally never worried that they wouldn’t get pregnant]?” I’m guessing a lot of people on this sub know that line; it’s definitely not for me or my husband. I’m relieved to throw myself into night classes, just so there’ll be a test I can pass. I’m saving money to see a RE, but it’ll be years before I can afford even a single round of  IVF, which my insurance doesn’t cover (nor will it be required to). </p>

<p>The worst part is my husband acts like he doesn’t care about the infertility at all, and flat out won’t talk about it, and jokes he only cares that he’s getting to have sex. He won’t look at a website, won’t take supplements, agrees to stop smoking pot and cut back on beer (but doesn’t), he doesn’t want to know about my cycle, he’s not interested in seeing the specialist with me. I don’t know if it’s bravado, if he’s afraid I’ll cry if I bring it up, if he’s afraid he’s the one who’s infertile, or if he secretly doesn’t want kids and is afraid Ill divorce him and stop paying his bills if he’s honest. It makes me feel so lonely  and paranoid. </p>

<p>I’m working to remind myself how lucky I am. Other than the infertility thing, my husband is gentle and supportive and helps me a lot, I have a supportive family, I have a job a like and I’m going to night school for an even better one, and I’m trying to figure out what an acceptable future without kids can look like. It’s just hard sometimes, but I have to remind myself that life is still mostly good.</p>

Blah blah, I have PCOS and I don't ovulate on my own, did two cycles of timed intercourse with letrozole and trigger shot under the guidance of an RE. First cycle ended in a chemical pregnancy, second I just learned today ended in a negative.

I'm all mentally prepared to go for the next cycle, when the nurse tells me that the next step is to meet with our doctor in person, probably to discuss more aggressive intervention because I had ""poor results"".

I feel frustrated by this, and anxious. Is it normal to be, er, judged based on just two medicated cycles? I mean, I did have some success, right, even if it didn't last? I was feeling optimistic about my track record, does this mean I'm actually screwed?

I'm not ready for IVF yet. I'd really like to continue with the protocol we're on, because I mean, we had some version of success as far as I'm concerned. I'm afraid of getting pressured into something I'm not mentally ready for. I'm afraid of being given up on.

And now I just feel frustrated that this is more time, more weeks, pissed away until my doctor's appointment, and then more time to get back on the pill to reset my hormones and start whatever next protocol. So much waiting, so much uncertainty, so much feeling like I wake up to waiting for the night to come again so that there is one less day of waiting.

I apologize if any of my ranting is out of line. And I guess it's my bad for not really getting a clear expectation on how many cycles we'd do before moving on to the next thing. I am probably just being dramatic.

Could anyone share any insight into how their infertility treatments progressed? Is this normal? Thank you in advance.

<p>Could anyone share any insight into how their infertility treatments progressed? Is this normal? Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT: I can&#39;t thank you all enough for your thoughtful replies and for sharing your experiences. I have been stewing  on this, and I&#39;ve decided to arm myself with a list of questions I&#39;ve prepared beforehand, and be ready(ish) to stand our ground unless she has some earth-shattering information. It&#39;s scary, but, feels right. Thank you all &lt;3 </p>

I'm an early 30's guy living in Los Angeles, and last year my wife and I found out that I have a low sperm count and were recommended to try IVF. I currently work in Television, and even a company as large as The Walt Disney Company doesn't offer infertility coverage in the package we chose (we chose the Kaiser HMO). My wife can't leave her job and her insurance doesn't cover it either (she works for the University of California system and they don't offer it either).

So after MUCH soul searching, I've decided to \[temporarily\] leave the entertainment industry to work at a company that offers infertility benefits. Although I know that Starbucks employees get it even if they are part time, I want to make a move to a company that has better career prospects (*just in case I end up getting stuck there, or something*), so I've been actively pursuing a position at Bank of America, which also offers benefits to PT and FT employees (even at the teller level).

**Can we all crowdsource this together and make a list of all of the companies we know that offer infertility benefits?**

At the moment, Fertility IQ has done a bang up job making a [comprehensive Index for 2017-18](https://www.fertilityiq.com/fertilityiq-data-and-notes/fertilityiq-best-companies-to-work-for-family-builder-workplace-index-2017-2018) which has a good list of companies.

Know of any others that didn't make the list?

I had my first embryo transfer yesterday. The embryo is rated the highest quality (4 AA?) and I was so happy! 

The second embryo we got was still developing. They wanted it to grow more before freezing it. 

Today, the nurse called. 

The other one stopped developing. 

We have none to freeze. 

I am so happy that we had made it this far! After finding out that only 6 out of my 11 eggs were mature, and that only two fertilized and both made it to blast, I made it to FET. 

But the frozen one was meant to be a security blanket, in case this little one didn't make it. And, our government funded IVF only covers one session, plus all embryos created by it. 

I feel grief but I also feel ungrateful. This was so good, I have an embryo in me. And , hopefully, they'll make it!

I kind of suspected something was off when the doctor spoke so highly of our one embryo but kind of went ""they are still watching it before freezing it.""

Anyway, we made it so far with just the two. Having the one not make it was a slap in the face, our luck had run out.

<p>Anyway, we made it so far with just the two. Having the one not make it was a slap in the face, our luck had run out. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what I need right now. I am just rubbing my stomach, hoping the embryo in me sticks. Hoping to hope. Hoping to never have to do this again and go through these Hellish emotions. </p>

TL;DR: The US is ahead of Japan in terms of IVF, so if you're considering the US or Japan, go with the US clinic.

I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8qvo41/picking_a_city_to_do_ivf/) 2 months ago asking for suggestions on how to pick an IVF clinic. No matter what, we have to travel out of state since there aren't any IVF facilities in my state. Based on the advice I received, I ended up doing a few interviews with different IVF clinics.

The first was Pacific Northwest Fertility in Seattle, WA-- great success rates, but super expensive!

The second was Oak Clinic in Japan-- super affordable, but no real success rates. Also, super concerned about not getting quality care due to the fact that I'm fat.

The third was Reprogenesis in the Czech Republic-- super personalized care, but no real success rates and 30+ hours of travel time to get there.

I contacted other clinics and either received no response, got a nasty response, or just didn't feel like the follow through was very good with them.

So Reprogenesis was actually one of my favorite places. They have really personalized care so you see the same doctor throughout. With the Japan clinic, I actually had 3 doctors just by the time we got to the consult phase. The Pacific Northwest Fertility Clinic was fine and had great success rates, but we simply can't afford the cost. We ended up choosing Japan because we can't afford the Pacific Northwest Fertility clinic, and it just takes too long to the Czech Republic from where we live.

So, we get everything set up with Japan, and I still have a lot of reservations. I know I want to do pre-implantation genetic screening because of all my losses, but Japan can't do it. They have to send my embryos to somewhere else, and they have to do it through a shell company so that transfer can't be traced back to them. Also, they couldn't stop telling me how big I am. I'm fat, but I can still shop at normal clothing stores. But Japan is the best way for us to afford to do IVF with our genetic material first and still have money left over to try donor IVF cycles if it doesn't work.

I sell my happy place-- 5 acres of land up in the mountains-- to my FIL, a decision that I made with a broken heart but not a broken bank so money wins over happiness on this round. FIL starts telling everyone what's up. He wasn't sworn to secrecy or anything, but I hate feeling like I'm being talked about. He was just excited because he bought the land from us so that we can afford IVF. So, he tells my SIL, and she tells him to tell my husband to tell me (ugh! can you see why I hate this?) that she knows someone who is an IVF doctor in Oregon. Long story short-- I get around to calling this guy, and sure enough... he's an IVF doctor (let's call him Sparta because I'm having fun with names).

I tell Sparta all about our plan for 2 cycles of IVF in Japan. He stops me. He tells me, ""Don't go to Japan for IVF."" Then, he tells me a bunch of reasons why. He said that Japan is 5 to 10 years behind the rest of the world in terms of IVF. He said that if his clinic will call 1 of 4 embryos genetically normal, the Japan clinics might say 3 of the same 4 embryos are genetically normal. He said that they don't have the same regulations on how sensitive tissues are handled, and there are mix-ups all the time. He said a team in his office just got back from Japan -- because they were going there to help bring Japanese patients to the US for IVF.

I was crushed. I literally was waiting to fill my prescriptions for my first round of medications to start IVF in Japan, and here's this incredibly qualified guy telling me that Japan is a long shot for us getting pregnant.

Then he breaks it down for me. Sparta tells me that my best chance of getting pregnant is with donor embryos. He said that by the time people get to him, it's not uncommon for them to have spent 6 figures on IVF cycles. Sparta said it's not unheard of for his clients to have spent over $500,000 on IVF. Guys! I do not have 6 figures to spend on IVF-- I've got less than $30,000. Sparta also said that for those people, the chance to pass on their genes and to be genetically related to their children is often an emotional decision... and that he often tries to persuade them to consider things purely from a numbers standpoint. Sparta said if we use donor embryos, there's an 80% chance we'll get pregnant.

So my next question, naturally was, ""Sparta, will you be my IVF doctor?"" He said no-- he only sees people from other countries, but Sparta said that Pacific Northwest Fertility is a good place to go with sound medical practices and a respectable lab, plus they are about $10,000 cheaper than Sparta's own clinic.

At this point, I'm 6 months past the fourth failed IUI. I am not looking forward to starting over, but based on Sparta's advice, I contact Pacific Northwest Fertility. We are waiting for our appointment with the IVF doctor. Two donor eggs will cost us $22,000 at Pacific Northwest Fertility. 

So after all my work and research and money spend on consults, we ended up picking a place in the US due in large part to how regulated the industry is. From mandatory reporting for success rates to how tissue samples are handled, the regulations give us a lot of peace of mind. I just wanted to share my experience in case there are other people out there considering travelling abroad for IVF.

<p>I was crushed. I literally was waiting to fill my prescriptions for my first round of medications to start IVF in Japan, and here&#39;s this incredibly qualified guy telling me that Japan is a long shot for us getting pregnant.</p>

<p>Then he breaks it down for me. Sparta tells me that my best chance of getting pregnant is with donor embryos. He said that by the time people get to him, it&#39;s not uncommon for them to have spent 6 figures on IVF cycles. Sparta said it&#39;s not unheard of for his clients to have spent over $500,000 on IVF. Guys! I do not have 6 figures to spend on IVF-- I&#39;ve got less than $30,000. Sparta also said that for those people, the chance to pass on their genes and to be genetically related to their children is often an emotional decision... and that he often tries to persuade them to consider things purely from a numbers standpoint. Sparta said if we use donor embryos, there&#39;s an 80% chance we&#39;ll get pregnant.</p>

<p>So my next question, naturally was, &quot;Sparta, will you be my IVF doctor?&quot; He said no-- he only sees people from other countries, but Sparta said that Pacific Northwest Fertility is a good place to go with sound medical practices and a respectable lab, plus they are about $10,000 cheaper than Sparta&#39;s own clinic.</p>

<p>At this point, I&#39;m 6 months past the fourth failed IUI. I am not looking forward to starting over, but based on Sparta&#39;s advice, I contact Pacific Northwest Fertility. We are waiting for our appointment with the IVF doctor. Two donor eggs will cost us $22,000 at Pacific Northwest Fertility. </p>

<p>So after all my work and research and money spend on consults, we ended up picking a place in the US due in large part to how regulated the industry is. From mandatory reporting for success rates to how tissue samples are handled, the regulations give us a lot of peace of mind. I just wanted to share my experience in case there are other people out there considering travelling abroad for IVF.</p>

Met with our RE and basically at this point they are saying it’s hard to say if it was the egg or sperm due to 5 mature and 80% of them fertilized. So we are looking at cycle #2 in the next few months if all goes well financially. RE is keeping me on the microdose Lupron protocol with a few adjustments but not many. She has me now on CoQ10 in addition to prenatals and 2,000 iu of vitamin D. As for my husband, she is recommending a TESE due to possible DNA fragmentation. She also recommended acupuncture for the both of us. 

She also said that either our first cycle was a fluke and this second cycle will possibly have better outcomes or if it fails again on day 3, we can sum it up to the fact that our bodies just don’t make good embryos. It was hard to hear but We did talk about a plan B if this cycle isn’t successful and the best one would be embryo donation. 

Overall it was a much more positive and productive appt than we were expecting. Still a lot of emotions but we are just glad that we at least have a couple of plans in place for us.

As background, this will be my 4th FET with PGS normal embryos.  For both my second and third FETs, I used embryo glue and had implantation, but not further success.   My next FET will be with higher quality embryos from a different cycle than the other three attempts.  There is some concern that my uterus may be the issue, but my RE does not feel that it cannot support a pregnancy and we've finally found that estrogen patches work to get my lining to the desired thickness.

After hearing about the hCG wash here, I asked my RE if they would be open to trying that for my next cycle.  I found out today that she got permission from the lab director for me to do this (it is not something that is part of their regular protocol).  I've read some studies on hCG wash, my RE feels like this is more of a grey area in terms of increasing odds, but again, is willing to add this in.

The caveat is that she is hesitant to do both embryo glue and an hCG wash.  She indicated there have not been studies that look at the use of both together, and personally is a bit concerned about adding too much liquid to the uterus during the FET (the concern is that may inhibit implantation).  Her recommendation is for me to just use embryo glue again, but ultimately, left the decision in my hands.  Kind of like a bad ""choose your own adventure"" novel.

On one hand, I don't want to go against her advice, and I have had implantation with embryo glue in the past.  On the other hand, I'm tempted to try something new since I have not yet had success.  I have 3 PGS normal embryos remaining and know that emotionally, this may be the last try time I try a transfer before discussing moving on to other options.  That makes me just want to do both, but again, don't want to go against her recommendation.

I'm also going to post this in [r/infertilitybabies](https://reddit.com/r/infertilitybabies), but thought some people here may have had similar conversations with their REs.  Has anyone had detailed conversations with their REs about these, used both in a cycle, or have additional pointers to research?  What would you do?

**Update**
After reading the responses here and in r/infertilitybabies and continuing to do research on my own, I've decided to go with the hCG wash (500IU immediately before transfer).  Ultimately, it came down to the following

176,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello, everyone. I'm hoping to get some advice from people who've been through IVF.

Background: I'm 33 and have had 4 failed IUIs, with one CP in May. I have anovulatory PCOS but have been ovulating on a 35 day cycle for 8 months now with 7.5 mg Letrozole. I've lost 110 pounds in the last few years as part of my conception journey, and have about 40 to go before I'm in the normal BMI range.

Unfortunately, while I've lost weight, my husband has gained a significant amount. He is morbidly obese (over 400 lbs), and it has affected his sperm. 3 years ago, when he was probably 100 lbs lighter, he had 4 SAs done over the course of 6 months, with them starting out not too bad, and getting progressively worse, to where our RE said IVF was our only option. We didn't pursue further treatment after that, because I decided I wanted to lose weight. Started up again April '17, and my husband was put on Clomid. He's been on it ever since, and it's helped, despite his weight gain. For our first two IUIs (which started in March '18) his count post-wash was 7.5 mil. The next two IUIs his count went own to 2.5 mil, and we don't know why. After our fourth fail, our RE told us that the next step would be IVF. He said it wasn't impossible for us to conceive naturally, but emphasized how much higher the success rates are with IVF vs IUI.

We decided to try naturally for 6-12 months, and really focus on my husband losing weight. It has been difficult for me to be told *yet again* that I have to wait months and months for a chance (I have no hope of TI working) especially since IVF itself is such a long process. But I also acknowledge that it would be prudent to do everything we can to give ourselves a chance before we shell out that kind of money and put my body through hell. (You ladies are absolute warriors and I am in awe of every single one of you.)

My concern is time. I will be 34 in a few months and just don't know how wise it is to let my eggs get any older. I am fortunate that I have a very high AMH due to my PCOS, but I'm still worried about quality issues, especially given that I'm still overweight and suspect that I still have pretty bad hormonal imbalances.

To those of you with experience, do you think it would be better to start IVF now at this younger age, rather than try to get my husband's numbers up? I asked my Dr. that same question at my last visit and he was maddeningly unhelpful. I'm terrified of more time going by with no change, terrified of my husband losing weight but it still not fixing the problem, and I'm also terrified of not giving us a chance to do the right thing and address some obviously huge issues with our health. I kick myself every day for not taking this all more seriously when I was younger- now I feel that time is about to slam the door on my hopes of conceiving, and I just don't know what to do. I've been in the depths of despair for so long now that I don't feel capable of making good decisions. Any advice or perspective would be greatly appreciated.

I have mixed emotions, because on one hand I am happy to finally be proactive in this process, on the other hand, I'm confused following the appointment because I feel like the doctor has decided I need a lot of intervention and possibly IVF before even conducting one test.

My mother had severe endo that resulted in a full hysterectomy when she was 35. However, I ovulate as confirmed by OPKs, CM and BBT and very regular 26-27 day cycles. 

I have never been diagnosed with Endo, and have not done one single test, even bloodwork, to get a base on what is going on. As I said this was my first appointment and consultation.

She said she has a strong suspicion I have endo, and offered me the option to jump right to a laparoscopy and that I possibly qualify for an IVF trial coming up next month.

Isn't that moving a little fast? I am a healthy woman who has managed to get pregnant twice and am otherwise healthy.

At the end of the appointment we decided to do the HSG, sonography, Cycle 3 bloodwood and go from there. 

I just feel like she has already decided without one single exam that i'm a lost cause in conceiving naturally, which is scary to me.

187,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I probably don’t belong here because, I mean, I don’t really belong anywhere. 

SO and I have been together for nearly four years. I’m 18, he’s 20. At first we used condoms, then I tracked my period for a while, and then we kind of stopped caring. 

About a year or so in, it kind of dawned on us that... there was no accidental pregnancy. And so the topic of “if something is wrong” came up. 

And now it’s almost like a secret between us. There might be something wrong, and we might never have kids. And I could deal with it, mostly, for a while. 

Except now... seven people we know are pregnant. SO’s sister/cousin (his mom married his dads brother after his dad passed) is pregnant. His brother’s GF is pregnant (not his kid)... and they’re terrible. They won’t stop smoking weed or cigarettes at all. They claimed they would slow down but they aren’t. If anything they’re smoking MORE now that they’re pregnant. They’re 15&16 for gods sake. 

And so when we go to SO’s house (he lives with me and my parents) I just sit there, awkwardly, while they talk about their pregnancies. And it’s EVERYTHING. 

Like one of them had a pimple. “Oh I remember first tri acne. It was terrible.” 

They ate a big meal and were there complaining about their stomachs hurting. “Oh it’s your uterus stretching to make room for the baby.” 

And I’m a picky eater. I try not to be but I can’t help it. I literally gag. So when we were down there I got food for myself. SO didn’t want anything because he ate at home. We brought it back and sat in the living room. I offered SO some and he didn’t want any so I ate it. Last time we did this, we had more money and bought both pregnant girls food. 

The next day, his mom got mad at me for eating in the living room. “It was rude to eat in front of the pregnant people. It’s bad for them to really crave something and not get it. Like [SO’s brother] got a strawberry mark cause I didn’t get strawberries when I wanted them one time.” 

And I just felt shafted. Like pregnant or not I’m still fucking human and need to eat. Had they wanted any, they could have fucking asked for it. I would have shared. And even then... last time we literally bought them food. It’s not my fault they got pregnant and can’t afford to get their cravings because they spend all their money on fucking weed. 

Now the more I sit here and think about them being pregnant, the more I feel... left behind, I guess? They’re having babies. And in a couple years I know we’ll still be struggling/pretending there isn’t a problem, while my friends are having babies. 

And being left behind had been pretty much the story of my life. So it sucks. And will continue to suck.

<p>The next day, his mom got mad at me for eating in the living room. “It was rude to eat in front of the pregnant people. It’s bad for them to really crave something and not get it. Like [SO’s brother] got a strawberry mark cause I didn’t get strawberries when I wanted them one time.” </p>

<p>And I just felt shafted. Like pregnant or not I’m still fucking human and need to eat. Had they wanted any, they could have fucking asked for it. I would have shared. And even then... last time we literally bought them food. It’s not my fault they got pregnant and can’t afford to get their cravings because they spend all their money on fucking weed. </p>

<p>Now the more I sit here and think about them being pregnant, the more I feel... left behind, I guess? They’re having babies. And in a couple years I know we’ll still be struggling/pretending there isn’t a problem, while my friends are having babies. </p>

<p>And being left behind had been pretty much the story of my life. So it sucks. And will continue to suck. </p>

204,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Warning: mention of living child due to discussion of issue related to donor sperm sibling-hood

Hello!  My wife and I (two women) are trying to conceive a sibling for our child, ideally using the same sperm donor we used for that child.  We only have a few vials left of that donor (we're currently in the midst of our first IUI as a result of RPL and DOR), and have located someone with vials of our donor that are willing to sell to us.  The only problem: they live over a thousand miles away (we're all in the US).

We'd need to pay them, and then they'd sign the bill of sale, and then we'd provide the bill of sale to the cryobank to complete the transfer of ownership of the vials.  The cryobank will not serve as an intermediary for the sale.

We're trying to figure out the best way to deal with such a huge transaction remotely.  I thought that it's possible some here might have had a similar experience.

We've come up with two options:
1) One of us fly down there, stay one night, meet them & complete the transaction in person (i.e., here's the money, please sign this form, thank you & good day).  This would cost about $200 (there are some super cheap flights).

2) Create an agreement that we both sign, indicating the intent to sell & the sale price & including all of our details, then pay them through PayPal or similar, then they send us the signed bill of sale.

What would you do in this or a similar situation?  Any recommendations (or ideally, first-hand experiences) are very welcome!

227,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"**Update:** Just found out I have a tiny prolactinoma! So now the added decision is, do we start any of this now, or wait for the cabergoline to work?

I'm expanding a bit on the question I posed in the donor thread yesterday. This is mostly to get my thoughts out, but I'd really appreciate any feedback or ideas on which course of action makes the most sense (assuming my RE doesn't declare us mentally unfit for flip-flopping so many times!)

Quick recap:  Two cycles (one ICSI, one half & half) got us 18 eggs, and 5 embryos that made it to day 3, but never made it to blast. Standard insemination seemed to give us a much higher fert rate (60% instead of 15%, with an admittedly small sample size). We have two cycles of insurance coverage left, which pays for monitoring, retrieval, IVF/ICSI, and PGS. We pay for all meds out of pocket.

We're trying to decide how to use our final two insurance-covered cycles, and how much of a chance to give our own genetics.

**Evidence for egg problem:**

- My AMH is .88 and FSH is 11.5
- AFC ranges from 7-14
- I'm an autoimmune mess

**Evidence for sperm problem:**

- All embryos have made it to day 3 but not day 6.
- Standard insemination gave us a much higher fert rate (though eggs were mature, looked fine, and were not fragile). 
- Family history of unexplained infertility (both paternal uncles)

**PLAN A:**

1. Do our next IVF cycle with my eggs, half his sperm, half donor sperm. If donor sperm works and his does not, we've found our problem.
2. If donor sperm fails, confirmed egg problem. Use final insurance cycle on donor eggs and his sperm.
3. If #1 and #2 fails, confirmed egg AND sperm problem. Move on to donor embryos (out of pocket).

This plan could definitively tell us if we need donor eggs (before we take a chance and spend the money on them), but it also means giving up our last chance to go ""all out"" with our own genetics (using standard IVF, which we now know gives us a higher fert rate, on all of the eggs). We'll always wonder if we gave up too soon, and just needed one more try.


**PLAN B:**

1. Try one more IVF cycle with my eggs, his sperm, and standard insemination - because if not, we'll always wonder.
2. If that fails, use our final insurance cycle on donor eggs.
3. If #2 fails, do a few out-of-pocket IUIs with donor sperm, on the off chance that the problem was bad sperm (and not eggs) all along.
4. Donor embryos.

This plan bets on my eggs being the problem, and allows us to spend insurance on the most expensive things (PGS and donor eggs). If donor eggs don't work, it confirms a problem with my husband's sperm, but doesn't definitively rule out an egg problem. Unless we want to shell out an additional $20k, we'll never know if IVF with donor sperm and my eggs would have worked.

**PLAN $$$:**

1. Try one more IVF cycle with my eggs, his sperm, and standard insemination - because if not, we'll always wonder.
2. If #1 fails, use our last insurance cycle to do IVF with either half donor sperm or 100% donor sperm.
3. If #2 fails, pay out of pocket to do a donor egg cycle.

So now the added decision is, do we start any of this now, or wait for the cabergoline to work?</p>

<p>I&#39;m expanding a bit on the question I posed in the donor thread yesterday. This is mostly to get my thoughts out, but I&#39;d really appreciate any feedback or ideas on which course of action makes the most sense (assuming my RE doesn&#39;t declare us mentally unfit for flip-flopping so many times!)</p>

<p>Quick recap:  Two cycles (one ICSI, one half &amp; half) got us 18 eggs, and 5 embryos that made it to day 3, but never made it to blast. Standard insemination seemed to give us a much higher fert rate (60% instead of 15%, with an admittedly small sample size). We have two cycles of insurance coverage left, which pays for monitoring, retrieval, IVF/ICSI, and PGS. We pay for all meds out of pocket.</p>

<p>We&#39;re trying to decide how to use our final two insurance-covered cycles, and how much of a chance to give our own genetics.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence for egg problem:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>My AMH is .88 and FSH is 11.5</li>
<li>AFC ranges from 7-14</li>
<li>I&#39;m an autoimmune mess</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Evidence for sperm problem:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>All embryos have made it to day 3 but not day 6.</li>
<li>Standard insemination gave us a much higher fert rate (though eggs were mature, looked fine, and were not fragile). </li>
<li>Family history of unexplained infertility (both paternal uncles)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PLAN A:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Do our next IVF cycle with my eggs, half his sperm, half donor sperm. If donor sperm works and his does not, we&#39;ve found our problem.</li>
<li>If donor sperm fails, confirmed egg problem. Use final insurance cycle on donor eggs and his sperm.</li>
<li>If #1 and #2 fails, confirmed egg AND sperm problem. Move on to donor embryos (out of pocket).</li>
</ol>

<p>This plan could definitively tell us if we need donor eggs (before we take a chance and spend the money on them), but it also means giving up our last chance to go &quot;all out&quot; with our own genetics (using standard IVF, which we now know gives us a higher fert rate, on all of the eggs). We&#39;ll always wonder if we gave up too soon, and just needed one more try.</p>

<p><strong>PLAN B:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Try one more IVF cycle with my eggs, his sperm, and standard insemination - because if not, we&#39;ll always wonder.</li>
<li>If that fails, use our final insurance cycle on donor eggs.</li>
<li>If #2 fails, do a few out-of-pocket IUIs with donor sperm, on the off chance that the problem was bad sperm (and not eggs) all along.</li>
<li>Donor embryos.</li>
</ol>

<p>This plan bets on my eggs being the problem, and allows us to spend insurance on the most expensive things (PGS and donor eggs). If donor eggs don&#39;t work, it confirms a problem with my husband&#39;s sperm, but doesn&#39;t definitively rule out an egg problem. Unless we want to shell out an additional $20k, we&#39;ll never know if IVF with donor sperm and my eggs would have worked.</p>

<p><strong>PLAN $$$:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Try one more IVF cycle with my eggs, his sperm, and standard insemination - because if not, we&#39;ll always wonder.</li>
<li>If #1 fails, use our last insurance cycle to do IVF with either half donor sperm or 100% donor sperm.</li>
<li>If #2 fails, pay out of pocket to do a donor egg cycle.</li>
<li>If #3 fails, donor embryos.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this plan, the order of #2 and #3 wouldn&#39;t really matter - we would have to pay completely out of pocket for one. This would let us try one more time with our own eggs and sperm, and systematically test if our problem is due to eggs, sperm, or both before moving on.</p>

We’re about to head into our first cycle. I just turned 39.  No MFI. Likely cause of infertility is pelvic adhesions from multiple abdominal surgeries to remove fibroids. My numbers (approximate):

AMH 2.6
FSH: 4.3
E2: 51

We are about to have our pre cycle meeting with RE to discuss the protocol. My question is how does the RE decide what protocol to use?

237,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone. I’ve been lurking on and off on this forum for a while now.
I wanted to share my journey thus far because I hope it might give some good insight for others.
A little background: my husband is 40 and overall healthy- just has hyper mobility and should drop 15 lbs, I’m 28 and healthy besides pcos, but I’m 115 lbs, active lifestyle and don’t have much of the benchmarkers for pcos. I’ve never ever used oral contraceptives, just don’t personally believe in them for me.

We’d been trying to have a baby since Nov 2016. This January I went to Mexico City for a 3 week stay and did all my medical here, most importantly going to an amazing fertility clinic. I decided that I would do IVF here in Mexico City but needed to work out the details with my husband, so I bought 3 months worth of Metformin and 6 months worth (because that’s how it’s packaged) of Clomid, it’s over the counter here. I paid the equivalent of $70 usd (I also bought 4 months worth of Prozac because I needed it, my total of $70 includes the Prozac).

I had a horrible, horrible time on Metformin/Clomid. It sucked! I was really sick the entire time- I would sleep about 14 hours daily, had very low energy, developed vertigo, was vomiting almost daily or had diarrhea, hair loss.

During the 4 months Feb-April, we went to couples therapy because I’m just a big believer in therapy and if we were really going to make a big commitment of trying to have a child We both wanted to make sure we were in good emotional and mental shape for it. We decided that we would start IVF in June. I took May off and didn’t do any Clomid/Metformin. All that happened is I sweated a gross amount for about a week and a half and then felt normal again.

We decided to move to Mexico City for the entirety of our fertility journey. I do know we are lucky to be able to get up and go whenever we want, we have loads of flexibility in our lifestyle, I am aware no everyone can do so.

We arrived June 18, started treatment June 19, injections technically started on the 22. The first month was a bit trying because my husband got sick, and we were hopping from Airbnb to Airbnb while looking for an apartment to rent.
We found an apartment in a cool, hipster neighborhood, I’ve always wanted to live somewhere hip- Colonia Roma Norte. 2bedrooms/2bathrooms, balcony, it’s actually the entire 2nd floor the elevator comes to our door. $800/month usd equivalent. We’ve slowly been buying some furniture but so far the pad is pretty empty; but it’s still so cool.

The first cycle was Gonal 225 and Merapur 75, then 3 days in it changed to Gonal 150 and merapur stayed the same.

On July 4 they extracted my eggs, I made 40 eggs in total and from the 13 embryos that were good 4 survived. I took the rest of the month off and did birth control because my hormones were wild.

I decided to do another cycle to get more eggs and have the embryos frozen or just have backups if the implantation fails. I’m currently on the second cycle, same med amounts and the extraction is set for next Tuesday.

Surprisingly this has been so easy for me. I’m enjoying the IVF, which I assumed I would hate. I even took a week to go to the beach of Zipolite. The only discomfort I’ve had is a few days leading up to extraction I’m bloated and it hurts from so many eggs and my boobs hurt from plumbing up.

Now to what matters the most to me: how much have we spent! All converted to USD.

Clomid/Metformin- around $70 (minus the Prozac, I can’t find receipt so I don’t know exactly, sorry)

Initial consult in Jan- $50.00

IVF 1st Cycle- $3,071.00

Hysterosalpingografia- $123.61

Labwork for husband and I- $367.91

Prepay for PSG (or whatever the genetic testing is called)- $3,188.99


Gonal and Merapur (we made 2 diff purchases first cycle) total- $1,061.

Cerotide- $38.32

Birth control- 4.02

Gonal and Merapur (first purchase for 2nd cycle)- $493.68

IVF 2nd cycle (they gave me a “discount”)- $2,872.79
 

For us this is way cheaper than doing it in LA. I love the clinic, my doctor is so cool. This experience has brought my husband and I closer and it’s been surprisingly enjoyable.

Quick background for those who don't know - my husband has azoospermia with normal testosterone, normal LH, high FSH, no y chromosome microdeletions, normal karotype, and normal physical exam.  The urologist recommended mTESE but he only does a few a year, and was very very very expensive.  My RE recommended another urologist who is slightly more inconvenient location wise, but is thousands and thousands of dollars cheaper, infinitely more experienced, and has done a lot of research/written papers on the diagnosis and mTESE procedure.  We are waiting a month to see him, and are planning on taking the first available surgical date once we meet him. 

The first urologist shut down my question about any supplements or diet changes, but I'm curious what others have been told/think.  The doctor basically said ""eat leafy greens and exercise"" which my husband does already (literally eating a salad I forced on him as I type this) and has for a long time.

IVF #1 - 9-11 mature follicles seen on ultrasound, 5 retrieved, 5 mature, 3 fertilized, 2 made it to blast on day 6, last one grew to day 7 and was discarded (did not meet criteria for freezing by day 7). Both blasts biopsied and sent for PGS and both were abnormal.

IVF # 2 (current cycle) - 14-16 mature follicles seen on ultrasound, 11 retrieved, 9 mature, 5 fertilized, all five still alive on day 4 but only one made it to morula stage, all five still alive on day 5 but only three made it to morula stage, two still in multi-cell (cleavage stage), no blasts yet on day 5.

Which brought us to where we are today. We got our Day 5 report this morning. None of the 5 embryos made it to blast yet. Some are in morula stage and some are still in multi-cell (cleavage stage). The lab thinks the morulas are looking good and on track to become blastocysts tomorrow (same as IVF #1). Based on this update we decided against doing a fresh transfer because we really want to do PGS due to previous experience of chromosomal abnormalities. 

But my question is what is going to happen to the ones that haven't made it to morula by Day 5? They are still alive but are now at least two days behind. Do these have a chance at all or should we give up on them making to freeze? What's the reason for the slow embryo growth both cycles?

278,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello,

I needed a few days to ingest my first week of official infertility, but wanted to share what has happened thus far and what we know and don't know.  I hope this helps someone else, and maybe there is someone here that has been in a similar situation.

I've already written and introduction (you can see my post history for those details) so I'll spare you the back story, but long short of it was my OBGYN had conducted CD3 blood work on me (also HSG) and SA on husband back in Feb.  The doctor left a message that all my numbers were in normal range and husbands SA was excellent.  At 38 (me) and 41 (husband) we were both excited and happy everything looked good.  We proceeded with our tracking and efforts, and nearly every month my husband would roll over after our trying attempt and look at me and say ""yep, I know that's the one....swim little guys swim"".  I'd laugh and giggle and we'd talk to my tummy encouraging his guys to race to the finish. 

We've had fun trying to conceive and I know that is a far cry from what many women and men are experiencing, but we had  hope and excitement and no reason to believe that with time it would all work out.

After July came, and my period showed up I looked at my husband and said, maybe we need to see the RE.  Mostly because half the year is over and what if we needed just a little help, I wanted to get in to utilize the little insurance coverage I have (and before having to meet my whole deductible all over again).  So i called my OBGYN and met her within a few days, she gave the order to Shady Grove and then said let me run one more test, AMH.  She warned me not to take the results alone too much to heart, and so I proceed.  I called the next day to get a consult appointment to Shady Grove and was so happy to get in to see the doctor within a week.  Then things began to rapidly change...I called my OBGYN to have my file and test results faxed to the RE's office and reminded them when my AMH came back to send that over.  The nurse tells me it has and says your results are 0.27 and that's normal but we do like to see over 1.00.

I knew nothing of the ranges at the time, but something told me this was NOT good news.  I tried not to panic, but immediately started searching on her for AMH results...the more I saw the more panic set in.  I quietly searched all weekend and the more I read the more it looked like DOR was going to be my scarlet letter.  Since I wasn't sure of anything, I sat with this information all weekend and only told my husband that the number is supposed to be over 1.00 and that mine was 0.27, but the doctor said other things are looked at so not to panic.  

When we sat down this week with the RE at Shady Grove I knew in my gut something was wrong, besides the panic that my doctors office had not faxed my test results over when I arrived (after 30 mins of calling them we finally got the results while talking to the doctor), he looked at my numbers and then looked at me and said the good news is there is no MFI, ""your SA numbers are excellent"", but unfortunately if these numbers are correct (referring to me) then we are looking at sever DOR.  I asked was it my AMH alone that gave this prognosis?  He said no that my E2 of 133 and AMH is what is concerning.....I was angry....my E2 alone was alarming to him, why wasn't my OBGYN concerned, why did she tell me it was normal.  

We continued to talk and discuss my cycles, and I proceed to explain what I normally experience periods every 25-29 days and positive OPK's between CD 10-13, BUT something isn't right this month because I got a positive OPK on CD 16 (just the previous day) and this morning I work up and I'm bleeding pretty heavily.  He asked if I needed a tampon and I told him yes, before I left to see you it was heavy enough that it was going down my legs and I needed a tampon.  I explained to my knowledge I've never had such a short cycle nor have I ever had spotting mid-cycle or even leading up to my period.  We decided to assume that I was on CD 1 and he wanted to run all of my blood work all over again, get a vaginal ultrasound for AFC, and do the standard ID blood panel too.  

I cried when we walked out, but by the end of the night both my husband and I agreed that the bright side was I had just started my cycle and we wouldn't need to wait long for our follow up and next steps.  I spent this whole week looking up DOR results, egg donor process, cost, shared risk plans, and even embryo donation.  

Wednesday I had my CD 3 tests and ultrasound.....during my ultrasound they said my lining looked good, but found 2 follicles on the left and 4 on the right, so 6 total.  I knew that wasn't a great number but remember the doctor saying well if we have more than 5 then we can talk options with IVF versus donor egg.  In my husbands head that meant IVF with my own eggs may be an option if I had over 5.   Back to this board I went and when I saw women posting numbers of 10 plus AFC again I knew my little number 6 wasn't going to bring us the best news.  

Later that afternoon my nurse emails me with this..... 

E2 110

FSH 8.61

LH 3.32

TSH 2.300

Vit D 33.77

*""They are all within normal limits of an ovulation cycle.   Based on the ultrasound and the hormone values you are not at  baseline.   Which means you are still in an active ovulation cycle.  Dr. said call with day 1 of your next period to come in for the  baseline blood work and ultrasound.  We consider day 1 to be the first  full flow day of your period.  Please let  me know if you have any questions.*"" 

WTH...I literally ran from my desk called my nurse and asked her to explain, telling her that i had two full days of heavy red bleeding that needed a tampon (there was some brown blood but majority was bright red).  I hadn't bleed much that day, but normally my period lasted 3-4 days with day 3 and 4 being spotty through the day and heavier at the end of the day.  She tried to explain that based on the numbers it looked like I just ovulated and these numbers don't coincide with the beginning of my cycle....she used a lot of the formal terms, which confused me, but mostly because I was angry again.  The one bright side I had was we could move forward quickly and now I have this unexplained bleeding which was in no way spotting and no one can tell me why.

So here I am, still confused and each day swinging between hope, optimism, and sheer panic and fear.  My husband is in the frame of mind to have hope till we know otherwise, but even he had a small breakdown this week due to stress from work and knowing that we will need to come up with some serious cash whatever option we have (we just put nearly 100,000 down on our new home, all of our savings is in our new house).  

I guess my question is does my story resonate with anyone else, if so what was your ultimate plan?  I have lost all hope that I would have enough eggs or even quality (at 38) eggs to use my own....I'll never have a biological child.  Obviously I need to wait for the second round of CD 3 test, but would welcome anyone's experience and thoughts.  I fear the doctor will say I'm on the borderline of trying my own eggs versus a donor option, and then we get into the whole of spending the money trying my own crappy eggs, just to be told, yeah these are no good? Versus a donor option where I could at least go in knowing that the one factor that's been preventing success is eliminated (assuming we don't find anything else wrong with me).  The later option would give us all peace of mind that this could work, even if it takes a few times we can have the family we've always wanted. 

I'm also looking into embryo donation, and while my husband doesn't like the option, I've asked him to at minimum to keep it on the table and research it with me.  I feel awful admitting this but the first reason I wanted to explore this was the cost factor.  If we have to do donor eggs or even if they say regular IVF could give us good odds, I have in my head I must do the shared risk option.  I know my mind and I couldn't handle going in knowing I only have money (insurance coverage for one shot, we would still likely have over 5,000 to 10,000 out of pocket to come up with for one IFV cycle when you consider medications).  Getting accepted for shared risk IFV seems far fetched, and my age is ticking away (I'll be 39 in 6 months), donor egg shared risk may be more likely, but then it looks like that could be upwards of 40,000-high 50,000s including medication (this is all based off of my searching on this site please feel free if you have more concrete numbers to share).  The embryo route though is far less, and in my head seems so much more attainable, and for whatever reason has given me the greatest hope that its something we could actually do that wouldn't put our family so far in to debt, strain our marriage fighting over finances and how we will even afford our desired family if and/or when we succeed.  Financial security has always been a massive fear for me, it took a lot of trusting my husband to spend our savings on our house.  Yet, the thought of depriving my husband of a child of his own is so terribly painful....for some reason I'm doing better with the reality I may never have my own biological child, then taking his opportunity away.

When I did try to share why its something that gives me hope, he did share that he doesn't like it since there is nothing wrong with his sperm and he would be missing out as well.  He didn't mean it to hurt me, I totally get it, but it did sting.  I know he needs time, he isn't at my place, and since nothing is wrong with him he may never be.  I found a documentary called One More Shot, about a couple that decided to do embryo adoption.  I've asked us to watch it together, hoping I can understand more....and he can see how couples that have come to this place have found peace with this option as well.  

If anyone has been in a similar situation, on the borderline of options or if this speaks to you at all I'd love someone insight, guidance and/or resources.  I do apologize for how long this is, this is the first time Ive poured my thoughts and fears out, and so much of my thinking is all over the place.  I told my husband the best way for me to process this is to learn as much as possible about our chances of success, costs, and the general process before we get our results back.  I want to be armed with knowledge so we can make a call for what we can or are willing to do.  It takes time to make these decisions, and I definitely am feeling the pressure that time is not on my side.

Then things began to rapidly change...I called my OBGYN to have my file and test results faxed to the RE&#39;s office and reminded them when my AMH came back to send that over.  The nurse tells me it has and says your results are 0.27 and that&#39;s normal but we do like to see over 1.00.</p>

<p>I knew nothing of the ranges at the time, but something told me this was NOT good news.  I tried not to panic, but immediately started searching on her for AMH results...the more I saw the more panic set in.  I quietly searched all weekend and the more I read the more it looked like DOR was going to be my scarlet letter.  Since I wasn&#39;t sure of anything, I sat with this information all weekend and only told my husband that the number is supposed to be over 1.00 and that mine was 0.27, but the doctor said other things are looked at so not to panic.  </p>

<p>When we sat down this week with the RE at Shady Grove I knew in my gut something was wrong, besides the panic that my doctors office had not faxed my test results over when I arrived (after 30 mins of calling them we finally got the results while talking to the doctor), he looked at my numbers and then looked at me and said the good news is there is no MFI, &quot;your SA numbers are excellent&quot;, but unfortunately if these numbers are correct (referring to me) then we are looking at sever DOR.  I asked was it my AMH alone that gave this prognosis?  He said no that my E2 of 133 and AMH is what is concerning.....I was angry....my E2 alone was alarming to him, why wasn&#39;t my OBGYN concerned, why did she tell me it was normal.  </p>

<p>We continued to talk and discuss my cycles, and I proceed to explain what I normally experience periods every 25-29 days and positive OPK&#39;s between CD 10-13, BUT something isn&#39;t right this month because I got a positive OPK on CD 16 (just the previous day) and this morning I work up and I&#39;m bleeding pretty heavily.  He asked if I needed a tampon and I told him yes, before I left to see you it was heavy enough that it was going down my legs and I needed a tampon.  I explained to my knowledge I&#39;ve never had such a short cycle nor have I ever had spotting mid-cycle or even leading up to my period.  We decided to assume that I was on CD 1 and he wanted to run all of my blood work all over again, get a vaginal ultrasound for AFC, and do the standard ID blood panel too.  </p>

<p>I cried when we walked out, but by the end of the night both my husband and I agreed that the bright side was I had just started my cycle and we wouldn&#39;t need to wait long for our follow up and next steps.  I spent this whole week looking up DOR results, egg donor process, cost, shared risk plans, and even embryo donation.  </p>

<p>Wednesday I had my CD 3 tests and ultrasound.....during my ultrasound they said my lining looked good, but found 2 follicles on the left and 4 on the right, so 6 total.  I knew that wasn&#39;t a great number but remember the doctor saying well if we have more than 5 then we can talk options with IVF versus donor egg.  In my husbands head that meant IVF with my own eggs may be an option if I had over 5.   Back to this board I went and when I saw women posting numbers of 10 plus AFC again I knew my little number 6 wasn&#39;t going to bring us the best news.  </p>

<p>Later that afternoon my nurse emails me with this..... </p>

<p>E2 110</p>

<p>FSH 8.61</p>

<p>LH 3.32</p>

<p>TSH 2.300</p>

<p>Vit D 33.77</p>

<p><em>&quot;They are all within normal limits of an ovulation cycle.   Based on the ultrasound and the hormone values you are not at  baseline.   Which means you are still in an active ovulation cycle.  Dr. said call with day 1 of your next period to come in for the  baseline blood work and ultrasound.  We consider day 1 to be the first  full flow day of your period.  Please let  me know if you have any questions.</em>&quot; </p>

<p>WTH...I literally ran from my desk called my nurse and asked her to explain, telling her that i had two full days of heavy red bleeding that needed a tampon (there was some brown blood but majority was bright red).  I hadn&#39;t bleed much that day, but normally my period lasted 3-4 days with day 3 and 4 being spotty through the day and heavier at the end of the day.  She tried to explain that based on the numbers it looked like I just ovulated and these numbers don&#39;t coincide with the beginning of my cycle....she used a lot of the formal terms, which confused me, but mostly because I was angry again.  The one bright side I had was we could move forward quickly and now I have this unexplained bleeding which was in no way spotting and no one can tell me why.</p>

<p>So here I am, still confused and each day swinging between hope, optimism, and sheer panic and fear.  My husband is in the frame of mind to have hope till we know otherwise, but even he had a small breakdown this week due to stress from work and knowing that we will need to come up with some serious cash whatever option we have (we just put nearly 100,000 down on our new home, all of our savings is in our new house).  </p>

<p>I guess my question is does my story resonate with anyone else, if so what was your ultimate plan?  I have lost all hope that I would have enough eggs or even quality (at 38) eggs to use my own....I&#39;ll never have a biological child.  Obviously I need to wait for the second round of CD 3 test, but would welcome anyone&#39;s experience and thoughts.  I fear the doctor will say I&#39;m on the borderline of trying my own eggs versus a donor option, and then we get into the whole of spending the money trying my own crappy eggs, just to be told, yeah these are no good? Versus a donor option where I could at least go in knowing that the one factor that&#39;s been preventing success is eliminated (assuming we don&#39;t find anything else wrong with me).  The later option would give us all peace of mind that this could work, even if it takes a few times we can have the family we&#39;ve always wanted. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also looking into embryo donation, and while my husband doesn&#39;t like the option, I&#39;ve asked him to at minimum to keep it on the table and research it with me.  I feel awful admitting this but the first reason I wanted to explore this was the cost factor.  If we have to do donor eggs or even if they say regular IVF could give us good odds, I have in my head I must do the shared risk option.  I know my mind and I couldn&#39;t handle going in knowing I only have money (insurance coverage for one shot, we would still likely have over 5,000 to 10,000 out of pocket to come up with for one IFV cycle when you consider medications).  Getting accepted for shared risk IFV seems far fetched, and my age is ticking away (I&#39;ll be 39 in 6 months), donor egg shared risk may be more likely, but then it looks like that could be upwards of 40,000-high 50,000s including medication (this is all based off of my searching on this site please feel free if you have more concrete numbers to share).  The embryo route though is far less, and in my head seems so much more attainable, and for whatever reason has given me the greatest hope that its something we could actually do that wouldn&#39;t put our family so far in to debt, strain our marriage fighting over finances and how we will even afford our desired family if and/or when we succeed.  Financial security has always been a massive fear for me, it took a lot of trusting my husband to spend our savings on our house.  Yet, the thought of depriving my husband of a child of his own is so terribly painful....for some reason I&#39;m doing better with the reality I may never have my own biological child, then taking his opportunity away.</p>

<p>When I did try to share why its something that gives me hope, he did share that he doesn&#39;t like it since there is nothing wrong with his sperm and he would be missing out as well.  He didn&#39;t mean it to hurt me, I totally get it, but it did sting.  I know he needs time, he isn&#39;t at my place, and since nothing is wrong with him he may never be.  I found a documentary called One More Shot, about a couple that decided to do embryo adoption.  I&#39;ve asked us to watch it together, hoping I can understand more....and he can see how couples that have come to this place have found peace with this option as well.  </p>

<p>If anyone has been in a similar situation, on the borderline of options or if this speaks to you at all I&#39;d love someone insight, guidance and/or resources.  I do apologize for how long this is, this is the first time Ive poured my thoughts and fears out, and so much of my thinking is all over the place.  I told my husband the best way for me to process this is to learn as much as possible about our chances of success, costs, and the general process before we get our results back.  I want to be armed with knowledge so we can make a call for what we can or are willing to do.  It takes time to make these decisions, and I definitely am feeling the pressure that time is not on my side.  </p>

<p>Thank you so much for letting me have my therapy session and do a brain dump on here...you are all so amazing and strong.</p>

I’m in a predicament and got to thinking that there is no way I am the only one who has faced this challenge in the infertility world. So, here it goes:

After 5 pregnancy losses, lots of therapy and over a year of researching various doctors and clinic statistics, I finally found a clinic and doctor and lab that I want to work with, everything has been going smoothly preparing for a retrieval and then we find out our options for paying for a cycle of IVF, which are:

1. The clinic’s all cash rate

2. File insurance to utilize the little IVF coverage we have, then we would be responsible for any remaining balance. 

Sounds pretty normal, right? But, what isn’t sitting well with me is that if we do choose to pay cash, the clinic’s billing department is saying they will not provide us the codes to file claims with our insurance company on our own and if we want to use our benefits, they would file the insurance for us. 

Is this even legal? Has anyone ever experienced this and how did you handle it?

**tl;dr Thoughts on taking a break between IUIs to try some natural boosters for next time. My husband just tells me to do what I think is best but I don't know anymore!**

So, I just found out that our third IUI failed. First two were medicated with Follistim + Ovidrel. This 3rd one, I had a surprise functioning ovary during baseline testing/ultrasound, so we didn't do Follistim but did Ovidrel before the IUI. 

My initial thought was, great we have money saved that we didn't use for Follistim last cycle, let's try one more medicated and see what happens (this might be our last try because of money). I can't help thinking that this might be a good time to take a break though. I've been making diet and fitness changes, losing a little weight, etc., and I have a previous supplement regimen that worked -- but it requires a couple months to really make a difference (or so I'm told).

Based on the IUI timings this year, there wasn't really a good opportunity to try the things that have previously helped me (plus, I figured since we needed IUI this time, the meds would override any issues I could have ""fixed""). I was anovulatory (PCOS) before successfully conceiving 3 years ago. After several failed Clomid cycles (timed sex, not IUI), I started ovulating on my own, after an RD friend suggested maca, vitex and some other things during the months I was on a break from the Clomid.

I'm torn because I hear the success rates are higher the more IUIs you do? At least, until you get to 5 or 6, right? We don't have sperm issues, just my PCOS/ovulating issues, so we're good candidates for IUI (as opposed to IVF). So I don't want to ""ruin"" any momentum we have from the previous 3 IUIs. But I also feel like I should be doing more to help my chances? Whatever that means.

290,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi All,

First time poster here. Desperate for answers. Looks like I just had my 3 failed transfer. My official beta is tomorrow but since my at home pregnancy test at 7dp6dt is negative I'm pretty sure I have nothing to look forward to.

What's keeping me going right now is putting together a list of questions for my WTF appt. I was hoping for help and advice on next steps.

Here's my history:

TTC #1 since 6/2016. PCOS, diagnosed since I was 18. I should mention I am skinny, 118 lbs and 5'5 so not the typical case. I am currently on 2000 mg of metformin. Clinic had me on 1500 mg but my PMP increased it to 2000 as she specializes in PCOS. 7 failed IUIs. Failed fresh - CP. It was barely a positive with a first beta of 7.8, second beta of 0. Failed FET #1. Then we did PGS testing and ERA and took several months off. My first and only egg retrieval results were 23 retrieved, 13 fertilized (no ICSI), 5 made it to day 5, all 4 5AA and one 5AB. 5 more made it to day 6, also great embryos. After PGS we had 6 left (3DB, 5AB, and 4 that were 5BB). Assuming they used 5AB this time that was a day 6 blast. I've had the immunology tests for hypercoagulable states and NK cells. 

**Baseline Numbers for all cycles:**

Fresh transfer 8.6 lining, estrogen at 3000 (moderate OHSS)

FET #1 8.6 lining, estrogen at 343

ERA Cycle 8.3 lining, estrogen at 432

FET #2 first baseline 7.8 lining, estrogen at 296; Doctor wanted better so estrogen was increased & suppositories added

FET #2 2nd baseline 8.6 lining, estrogen at 497

**What I've had done and done:**

\- HSG, perfectly clear tubes, no blockages

\- Hysteroscopy with endo scratch prior to IVF #1, showed no inflammation or issues

\- Hysteroscopy with endo scratch prior to FET#2, no inflammation. My cervix was dilated bc it's tilted and has caused painful transfers.

\-  acupuncture, exercise, brought my testosterone level down from 49 to 23 as recommended by my PCP, changed my diet to be mostly gluten and dairy free, try to eat organic meat and produce. Not sure this helped since this cycle was the first time my lining was thinner than usual and estrogen was lower.

My last FET protocol:

Calendar picture included. I took baby aspirin, and the other meds listed.

Vitamins I take: bee pollen + royal jelly + bee propylis combo (supposed to reduce pcos related inflammation), zinc, vitamin d 2000iu, folic acid, fish oil, super b complex

Update: We did all the blood testing possible and everything has come back normal. I had a lap with hysteroscopy done to check for silent endo and a possible hydrosalpinx, nothing found. I had my cervix dilated with a catheter this time due to difficult transfers. Next step is adding prednisone, lovenox, claritin, and pepcid AC to my protocol. There was some confusion about my ERA. Igenomix originally recommended an extra 24 hrs of PIO based on biopsies done on day 5 and day 7 but now they want me to try at 143 hrs instead of at 135 hrs. We will also be transferring two embryos for the first time. We are not really optimistic at this point but I've got 5 embryos left. My plan is to use them all and do another retrieval. This way, if some miracle cure comes around for RIF, I'll have a chance.

After a lost pregnancy, my primary care physician told me to try for 6 months and then make an appointment. Well, it's been 6 months now and my primary care doc is on maternity leave. I don't even know where to start to get diagnosed with any particular type of infertility.

The only thing I have right now is that last year I was tested for AMH and the results weren't good.

Complicating this, I went for an appointment in May for an ulcer with another doctor at the same clinic because my PCP was busy. During the visit I asked her just one question about trying to get pregnant and she added a CPT code for preconception counseling to the bill that they sent to my insurance company. Now the insurance company won't pay for that visit even though it was primarily about the ulcer.

When I found out that my PCP was on leave I was just going to make an appointment at another clinic for a regular pap test, and ask that doctor about what my next steps are. But now that I got the bill for the appointment in May I'm afraid to make an appointment to start about (possible) infertility because I don't know what I have to pay for and what will be covered by insurance.

I guess I thought that my insurance would cover everything up until I started to get any treatments, if necessary.

As a quick introduction my wife and I have been trying for years, with 3 failed IUI's, we're in our early 30's, never had a positive result, chemical or anything resembling a step in the right direction. We are classified in the unexplained category, as no testing has shown anything wrong.

So basically, I (The male half of this shared throwaway account) spend a considerable amount of time cycling and in the gym.  As far as I can tell,  cycling has largely been debunked as being detrimental to sperm production at least in terms of physical trauma to the area, assuming proper bike and saddle fitment.  However, the heat aspect has never really been isolated and explored.  Considering that a typical ride may consist of 2+ hours of sustained 80% to 90% max heart rate activity, all the while wearing a padded ""liner"" shorts that keep everything crammed in, there's little ability for cooling or temperature regulation.  Additionally, there's travel time to and from the trail to consider, and generally .5 to 1 hours of bullshitting with buddies afterwards, all the while the neither-regions are getting cooked.

A typical week probably includes 8 to 10 hours of fairly intense riding with a high heart rate.

Quick backstory first: I've spent the last 3+ years dealing with IF, I'm an active member over in r/IFseniorclass not so active anymore here cause of our circumstances and lengthy history (but use to be and am trying to when I can). But MFI + my autoimmune = IVF with 2 egg retrievals, 5 transfers (7 total embryos) and 4 miscarriages. We're now moving on with life childfree.

I recently started a t-shirt/tank top/legging company, mostly fitness, tacos, and drinking related shirts. I'm wanting to add an infertility section to raise awareness and too give our sassier and crasser IF and IFchildfree types a place for shirts (and hopefully socks, working on that). Here's the point of the post:

**What saying, ideas, and pictures would you love to see on a tshirt? (Explicit content is welcome).**

Once this is ready to go in addition to the shirts there will be some basic info about IF and resources. And of course (with the thumbs up from the mods) I'll share the link here.

Quick backstory first: I&#39;ve spent the last 3+ years dealing with IF, I&#39;m an active member over in <a href=""/r/IFseniorclass"">r/IFseniorclass</a> not so active anymore here cause of our circumstances and lengthy history (but use to be and am trying to when I can). But MFI + my autoimmune = IVF with 2 egg retrievals, 5 transfers (7 total embryos) and 4 miscarriages. We&#39;re now moving on with life childfree.</p>

<p>I recently started a t-shirt/tank top/legging company, mostly fitness, tacos, and drinking related shirts. I&#39;m wanting to add an infertility section to raise awareness and too give our sassier and crasser IF and IFchildfree types a place for shirts (and hopefully socks, working on that). Here&#39;s the point of the post:</p>

<p><strong>What saying, ideas, and pictures would you love to see on a tshirt? (Explicit content is welcome).</strong></p>

<p>Once this is ready to go in addition to the shirts there will be some basic info about IF and resources. And of course (with the thumbs up from the mods) I&#39;ll share the link here.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your ideas!! I&#39;m sorry we&#39;re all here and I hope I can help bring a smile to some shitty times and maybe raise some awareness too.</p>

A bit of background: my husband and I are 38 with unexplained infertility and 3 IUIs and 3 fresh IVF transfers behind us (third transfer ended in a chemical).

Looking for gentle advice please. 



Had a suspected abdominal pregnancy after iui with donor and trigger shot back in April. (Despite rising hcg the doc couldn't find the pregnancy anywhere in my lady bits, and it was very obvious it was not in my uterus)....this was my 6th loss and I needed 3 double doses of methotrexate to start decreasing hcg levels...and this was my second ectopic pregnancy....confirming that BOTH tubes are stupid and I cant make a baby without IVF (which I cant afford)

didn't have a low quantitative hcg until end of May and I chose to defect from other blood draws because honestly I was sick of being stabbed and they had enough tests to prove hcg was on the decline and i was dealing with depression and didn't want to go into the office full of pregnant ladies....that was probably not the best decision and I know that
...i should have continued testing to zero...but i didn't do let's move on....

I am now 62 days since any bleeding with no sign of my period in sight. It's not possible for me to be pregnant (depression is a major mood killer)....plus I tested anyway because I'm a spaz and thought maybe I'm the first recorded case of immaculate conception...

I haven't read the entire thing yet, but some highlights from skimming are:

- Up to 10% of ICSI routinely fails

- Sibling oocytes behave similarly - so it's not that a handful of eggs fail to fertilize for each patient, but that some patients (like me) get an abysmally low fert rate with ICSI
- There are various ways that human error/poor ICSI technique can damage an egg
- In many cases, ICSI fails because of very poor egg or sperm quality
- Eggs can degenerate after ICSI if their membranes are either so stiff that they shatter, or so flexible that they take a lot of manipulation to penetrate. In these cases, ICSI probably shouldn't be attempted unless there is severe MFI.
