Now a month later he did a second semen analysis and this was his numbers: 

Count 29.4 (reference given >15)
Motility 84% (reference given >40)
Morphology 18% (reference given >14)

I just don't understand how morphology could jump from 5 to 18? My RE said if the second one came back low, we would be sent to a urologist. Now they are saying that he doesn't need to see the urologist or do anything. I guess I have 3 questions:

1. Has this happened to anyone else? Is it frequent that the first time is low and then the second is normal? My husband said (and sorry if TMI!) but the first time his sperm came out a little and then he had to keep going to get out more. And this time it came all at once? Not a man, so dunno if this makes a difference?

2. Should I push for a urology consult anyways? I just want to make sure if there is an issue we take care of it early. Trying to be super proactive but not overly crazy. 

3. Do these reference numbers seem right to you? Just want to double check.

2,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello everyone, 
I am here asking for advice because I am afraid I won't be able to handle the situation well on my own. 

A little of background information.
We are about to start IVF (April), and we are facing a very low chance of success due to my low AMH and high FSH and for a necessary PGD to rule out a congenital (and fatal) form of my genetic condition.

I moved to and currently live in my BF's country. I love it here, and I am at the final stage of higher adult education. 
However, I recently resigned from my job because of physical health and mental health issues (not IF related). Even if this is not my best moment in life, and I am emotionally struggling with a lot of things, I decided to go ahead and face my first cycle of IVF (age and numbers are working against me - it is a matter or now or never).

My family knew we were trying to go down the IVF route because of my genetic condition, so when we recently discovered about my really poor numbers, I kept them in the loop. Considering they live far away, it is not difficult to avoid discussing the matter when I don't feel like. I am lucky as they seem to have understood my boundaries on my IF. 

In here, I have my BF's family, and I feel close both to his mum and sister. 
When we started trying naturally, I went to have a chat with his sister because I wanted to make sure I was not going to put her in a tricky position. She was single, almost nine years older than me, and I just wanted to make sure she was ok about being involved with what was going on. 
As I didn't have the chance to choose how much involved I wanted to be when my friends had their babies, I just wanted her to have it her way, not mine.
She was incredibly supportive and told me that she was ok about being involved because she had decided to be child-free since a young age. 

After that months passed with no pregnancy and we were referred to a fertility clinic. 
After our first visit with the RE team, my BF and I decided not to share our IVF plans with his family because there were still many tests in the development and we agreed we needed a plan before upsetting them. 

Fast forward to now, we have a plan, will start our first IVF cycle in April, and I feel we are now at the point where we need to inform his family.

I selfishly think that we will need support and his family is as close to me as my own. I want to feel free to talk about this with them if I feel the need. His mum is also a retired nurse, so I think that she will also be more knowledgeable than me about injections and so on. There is also the possibility they will decide not to be involved, and I will need time to adjust to this too. It is all so new and scary.

Now, I wanted to meet one of the next weekends and talk with them just to let them know what is going on, but I also received news about my SIL struggling a lot with depression and anxiety. I am questioning if the situation with us would be detrimental for her and I am not sure how to approach the subject with my BF either. 
We love her, and we want to help, but at the same time, I have a limited time span to share this news with them and let them decide how much they want to be involved. 

I am extremely anxious about being vocal about our plans, our pain and our very limited hopes. I think it is also partly because I am aware of another couple (BF's best friend and wife) was considering IVF because of MI,  but they struggled financially and personally with what the process required (weight loss and medication). I feel for them, and I don't know how I will be able to share any news, if needed with them, without jeopardising their friendship.

I know I should not be so affected by other people's personal decisions, but as I said, this is a very delicate moment in my life. I am dealing with a lot of different things, and I am losing myself a little. 

I would appreciate any 'objective' piece of advice on this matter as all of this is really heavy on my mind.

So after I recently made the move from r/stilltrying over to infertility after we got diagnosed with MFI on top of my already diagnosed PCOS during IUI#1. Today hubs went to the urologist to get his low counts checked out. Back during the IUI cycle, his SA was 8.4M/ml (2.4M/ml post wash with only 0.5ml used for the sample) 30% motile and 1% morphology. Urologist was super nice and helpful in regards to the male side of infertility. He came in, chatted with us a bit, and asked my husband to ""drop his trousers"". I tried so hard not to giggle during this, but I let one slip.. haha 

Anyways, comes to find out, he has a grade 3 varicocele on the left side. Urologist recommended if we are planning to have more than one kid to go ahead with surgery to remove the varicocele. In the mean time, he checked a hormone panel to see if there was anything else we could do (medication wise) in the mean time to improve his numbers. 

The urologist made us promise to name our baby David if we get pregnant. Totes will doc! Get us knocked up!

tl;dr hubs has a blockage on his highway or swimmers which we're going to get surgery for so our next IUI numbers don't suck so bad. 

{Update} His testosterone came back low as well, so he's starting clomid. I'm actually really relieved to have some answers.

Urologist was super nice and helpful in regards to the male side of infertility. He came in, chatted with us a bit, and asked my husband to &quot;drop his trousers&quot;. I tried so hard not to giggle during this, but I let one slip.. haha </p>

<p>Anyways, comes to find out, he has a grade 3 varicocele on the left side. Urologist recommended if we are planning to have more than one kid to go ahead with surgery to remove the varicocele. In the mean time, he checked a hormone panel to see if there was anything else we could do (medication wise) in the mean time to improve his numbers. </p>

<p>The urologist made us promise to name our baby David if we get pregnant. Totes will doc! Get us knocked up!</p>

<p>tl;dr hubs has a blockage on his highway or swimmers which we&#39;re going to get surgery for so our next IUI numbers don&#39;t suck so bad. </p>

<p>{Update} His testosterone came back low as well, so he&#39;s starting clomid. I&#39;m actually really relieved to have some answers. </p>

Haven't even gone to a doctor or anything, but I'm pretty sure I am. I know that this sub is for those who've been diagnosed, but a diagnosis isn't available for me for another two years at least, and in the meantime, I'm still struggling 

My boyfriend and I met when I was fourteen, almost fifteen, and he had just turned seventeen. While I don't like to say it, before I met him, I'd had a few sexual encounters before, but I felt taken advantage of later, when I'd dealt with my personal problems surrounding sexual abuse. Condoms were used because the boys didn't wanna be dads just as much as I didn't wanna be a mom. 

With my current BF, the aforementioned one, we didn't use a condom once and after that we just stopped using them. He pulled out, and there were a few times we thought was a scare. 

And then I got baby crazy, because everyone his age group and mine were having them. I tracked my period, and by that point caution went out the window yesterday and we didn't even pull out anymore. 

It's been nearly two years of not pulling out EVERYTIME we have sex, yet there has been no pregnancy, accidental or not. I'm nearly seventeen, and while I've calmed the hormones down, I'm still struggling with the fact there may never be a baby, when all I've wanted was to be a mom. 

Adoption isn't an option, neither is IVF, mostly due to financial issues (my uni is gonna cost 100 000 $ + and he's currently getting his GED, going to become a construction worker) but also because of a history with anger issues (stemming from favoritism with his mom & older brother) and my abundance of untreated mental illnesses (again... stemming from abuse)

25,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband and I had a heart to heart tonight and it was not great. Long story ahead.

I should start by saying I'm currently out of a job and, as such, I'm feeling super displaced/low self-esteem/uncertain about the future/generally in a rut. A few other things have happened in the past couple weeks to heighten these feelings, like running into an old co-worker who was sort of my pupil who is now doing far better in his career than me, and today getting a rejection letter from a company I'd had 4 interviews with and thought for sure an offer was on its way.  

So anyway, last month we decided to get a second opinion about how to proceed with IF (after DOR diagnosis, 2 failed IUIs, a 1-egg IVF failure, and recent MFI diagnosis) and the doctor we saw recommended moving to DE IVF w/icsi. We were prepared for it, but still tough news.

A few days after the news I thought we'd get right into the DE process, but since husband was going to have vein surgery for the MFI anyway on march 31, we thought we'd take some time off. 

This has been the first time in 25 cycles, basically 2 years, I haven't had a plan for either that cycle OR the next. And it's been...strange. 

I started to think about why I was doing all this. I started thinking about being childfree. I started questioning if maybe that was the solution. Opting out. 

Of course I'd considered this before, but I always deep down knew the answer, which is that ultimately I'd be ok living child free, but my husband would not. I have lots of friends (ones he's not close to) who have made the choice actively to not have children. I have lots of adult hobbies like doing improv, writing, and making music. My husband's friends (and our close couple friends) ALL have kids, and he's a school teacher, where his entire work community revolves around kids and parents and families. The only thing he does outside of that is play video games and sometimes see movies with his friends when they leave their kids home with mom. I go to bars to see comedy and music venues to watch shows. He doesn't go with me. His sister has 3 kids. My siblings are both older and child free. We live in the city. His school and family are all in the suburbs, where he sees us going once we have our baby.

So I brought it up tonight. I've been thinking about being child free. I read a thing online about how some millennials (the ""selfie"" generation) view their kids as an extension of and reflection of themselves and their identity. I definitely know people like that, they are some of the people I'm most bitter towards. I thought, I'm the half of the relationship that is unsure about my actual ability/desire to raise kids, and would feel more comfortable with all this if it were my DNA and it were to, ya know, just happen. But that's a lost hope. So can I make the conscious CHOICE to raise a child that's not biologically mine? My husband could. I'm not sure I can. Maybe I'm the shitty millennial who has to see herself in her offspring.

He says (and ppl say) once that baby is in your arms you won't care. It will be yours. But I still feel SO BITTER right now. Is this permanent, or just a bi-product of the aforementioned rut? A symptom of depression brought on by waking up and not going to work or having much purpose for the past 3 months? Then my husband says, I had no idea you felt this way, everything we've done up until now had me thinking you were just as determined as I was to have this family. If you don't want kids, that seriously changes the entire relationship. That kinda falls under the category of ""irreconcilable differences.""

I'm like look, were just talking it out for now. I'm just telling you things I've been feeling. I know I'm depressed right now and I'm not suggesting making any major decisions until I can get out of this funk. But did you really never think I COULD go this way, just knowing what you know about me and how I live and who my friends are and how it's all kinda different than you? He said he just never really thought of it. Was he in denial? Was I? Am I still?

I think if we were to split up and he went on to have the family and life he wanted with someone else, I'd regret it. I'd probably move to a bigger city with more of the stuff I like to do, new faces and a fresh start, but then I'd see him in his family suburb life and think about how trite I was, I shouldn't have run away, should've stayed the course. He said, ""in this scenario, you act like I'd have it all, but I wouldn't have you."" 
""And how important is that to you in all this?"" 
""Very.""

We left it as, we agreed that Jesus, divorce would be horrible. Neither of us wants that. We love each other. It's just that he thinks of our path forward as having plan A (DE) plan B (adoption) and I think of there being a third option of neither. He sees only the 2. Yes we are different ppl, but we have always been better together. Why should this be any different?

We started trying January 2016. I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor in high school and have been on meds since then. My endocrinologist would never confirm my fears, but I always felt deep down that the tumor would cause fertility problems. It is a prolactin secreting tumor, which makes me produce milk (which is really weird considering I've never been pregnant!) It also messes with my other hormones and can suppress ovulation. 

The details: because of my medical history I went to my obgyn for help after only a few months trying. Blood work showed low progesterone, normal prolactin. Started on clomid - I didn't ovulate on 50 or 100mg but had success with 150. Since I didn't conceive after 3 months, I saw a RE. 

The workup with the RE showed low progesterone and slightly high testosterone. My ovarian reserve was good. Semen analysis was good - great count, slightly low motility. We decided to try a couple more months of clomid with OPKs before the HSG. I had the HSG since I didn't get pregnant - one of my tubes was blocked. Doc said he has no way of knowing if it is actually blocked or if I just had a spasm from the pain. 

So we continued on, and did 2 clomid cycles with trigger shot and timed intercourse this time. 
At some point during the clomid cycles, I had a routine visit with my endocrinologist. She started me on metformin due to my high testosterone, thinking it would help me conceive. I am and have always been petite (5 ft, 105 lbs)and I've had issues with low blood sugar since childhood. 

January was our first IUI. We did clomid plus trigger shot. I was hesitant to do the IUI because my lining was thin (5.2)after so many months of clomid. But the doc and nurses acted like it would be fine and said I should still try. I had between 5-7 good eggs but Aunt flo started right on time. 

This month, I was fed up with my doc continuing to prescribe clomid, despite it being 8 continous months! I asked and he agreed to Femara. I had 1 or 2 decent eggs so we did the trigger shot and a 2nd IUI. Unfortunately, Aunt Flo began exactly on time. 
Is my RE doing what you would expect? I have few answers and feel like there has to be a more definitive cause. We are going to get a 2nd opinion before anymore IUIs or IVF. What do you recommend as far as testing or treatments? What next steps should I take?

I've been wanting to introduce myself for awhile, but have hesitated doing so as I wasn't sure I'd been at this long enough to be allowed in. But as we are gearing up for our first round of IVF next month, I think I would really benefit from being active here. Right now I'm a regular over in r/stilltrying but I'd like to try it out over here too. As much as I love it there, I'm afraid I'm outgrowing that sub, as most of us over there are just starting to seek out treatment or are doing IUIs. We just finished our 3rd failed cycle of IUI. Now it's time to crank it up a notch. 

Backstory on us: I turned 30 this month, my husband will be 31 in a few months. We started actively trying in December of 2015. We did achieve a pregnancy in July, our 8th cycle, which I then lost at 5 weeks. That was hard, we are only now starting to heal from that. I'd done a little bit of testing throughout the first year, HSG was clear, ultrasounds showed I had some cysts. We went to the RE after 12 cycles. He diagnosed me with endometriosis. GP diagnosed me with Hashimoto's shortly following that. I'm set to see a rheumatologist in 2 weeks to look into a suspected autoimmune disease. I'm a mess. Luckily, my husband is holding up his end. He's got great numbers, I just can't get my body to do what I want it to. 

So we did 3 IUIs with 100mg of Clomid and the ovidrel trigger. After the first one didn't work I didn't really expect the others to be different. I was just getting through it so we could move on to IVF. I'm on CD5 today, and we are waiting for next cycle to start IVF, so we've are having a little reprieve from TTC. If anyone has any advice for a newbie going into IVF, I'd greatly appreciate it. I've been trying to learn everything that I can so I know what's happening and what to expect.

Hi internet friends. I'm MrsDayDreamer and I wanted to introduce myself and ask for some help. I've been lurking for awhile now and have found some great info in all of your posts. 

MrDayDreamer (30) and I (29) have been trying for 18 cycles now. We moved back to our home state (for many reasons, stress and being closer to family being two of them) about 5 months ago and I finally had my first RE consult mid-January. My cycles last about 23 days and for the last few months I've been ovulation around CD 14/15 (using OPKs, was previously temping vaginally also but it was causing problems with sleep). So that means I've had about 8 day LPs every cycle. Last year, I was having ~26 day cycles with supposed ovulation (confirmed via temping) around CD17/18, so even then around 8 day LPs. My progesterone levels were pretty non-existent last year (with the -
~26 day cycles) so I likely wasn't ovulating at all/well. The RE tested my progesterone the last two cycles and it was 3.1 ng/mL and then 8.0 ng/mL after an unmonitored round of Clomid (CD3-7 at 50mg). So still not showing great ovulation.  My RE pretty much said she wouldn't supplement with progesterone until after a positive pregnancy test so that's :/ 

After the poor progesterone results with Clomid, I requested CD3 testing for FSH, E2, and AMH.  The RE wanted to just do another two Clomid cycles (upping the dose) with monitoring, and then possibly IUI. Husband's sperm are good to go so I felt like IUI was jumping the gun a bit. After some back and forth with the RE, I finally got the blood tests. Values were as follows: 
FSH: 9.1 mU/mL (Follicular Phase ref: 2.5-10.2 mU/mL)
Estradiol: 48 pg/mL (Early Follicular Phase ref: 30-190 pg/mL)
AMH: 1.0 ng/mL (ref: 0.9-9.5 ng/mL)

Other relevant test results:
Prolactin (tested w/ last progesterone): 19.5 ng/mL (ref: 2.0-23.0 ng/mL)
TSH (tested in October 2016): 1.485 mcU/mL (ref: 0.4-4.2 mcU/mL)

I just got the AMH result via my online med record this morning so I haven't had a chance to talk about it with my RE. I think the next logical step is an AFC. Anyone have any thoughts on anything else I should be asking about? My insurance doesn't cover anything infertility related (yay), hence why I thought IUI was jumping the gun without the blood work. And IVF isn't in the cards for us because of that too.

Also, anyone have thoughts on a 1.0 AMH for a 29 year old? Seems pretty crappy for someone my age :( 

Thank you for reading and for any advice you can give.

Just thought I would post and get my thoughts out of my head a bit with an update.    
&nbsp;
[PREVIOUSLY ON](http://media.ifunny.com/results/2015/04/29/0le1647235.jpg) PAUL & GENEVIEVE VS. THE UNIVERSE: We started TTC back in October 2015.  After a few months of nothing, we did some tests.  I had a low sperm count and my wife's hormones were a little off (still in normal ranges, but approaching the edges of the ranges).   We kept trying, but then some DNA results finally came in and hit us with an EFFING hammer.  My wife was a Fragile-X carrier with an 80% change of a full mutation in the next generation which would result in mental and physical disabilities for our children.  So now the ONLY WAY to have healthy children is IVF with PGD to select the embryos without the gene.    
&nbsp;
NOW: So we have been through 4 IVF cycles now, trying to collect enough eggs to finally do the PGD test (because of course you can only do the test once on up to 12 embryos and then you have to pay to do it again).  Our cycles worked out like this:
    
&nbsp;Cycle 1: 8 eggs retrieved, 2 blastocysts, names: Scrappy & Pokey
    
&nbsp;Cycle 2: 4 eggs retrieved, 3 blastocycts, names: Huey, Dewey, & Louis
    
&nbsp;Cycle 3 (micro-flare): 4 eggs retrieved, 1 blastocyst, name: *indecipherable tears*
    
&nbsp;Cycle 4 (mini-IVF): 1 egg retrieved, 1 blastocyst, name: Polyanna
    
&nbsp;
So we have 7 so far.  We've been trying to get to at least 8 before we do the PGD test as statistically that gives us the best odds of 2-3 good blastys.  We would like to have multiple children so we feel we have to get all the embryos we can now because the Fragile-X mutation is likely to cause my wife to menopause early.  (Her hormones are already drifting to the edges.)  Thus this an elaborate, expensive numbers game we're playing against a [ticking clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw).
    
&nbsp;
The last cycle was the worst.  We did mini-IVF so we expected lower numbers, but our doctor took a vacation in the middle of it, passed us to his colleague, who changed things immediately and then we ended up with only 1 egg despite having like 3 great follicles during the checkups.  It was very discouraging because we think the new doctor messed things up and if we could have even gotten 2, we would have met our goal.
    
&nbsp;
Now we're on a break from the cycles to give my wife's body time to recover.  As you can see, her response seemed to decrease each cycle.  So we think a break might help.  We're also now in a financial fight with the clinic because insurance is finally paying out but they are trying to get all the money even though we paid them large cash deposits at the beginning of each cycle!  (That's a whole other long post so I'll save that for later)
    
&nbsp;

The really quick background is that we (both 30, I have PCOS, husband is fine) have been trying for over four years and in that time have had one miscarriage and three CPs. The miscarriage occurred before we started seeing the RE. The first CP was from an IUI and the other two were from consecutive FETs of untested embryos.  I had RPL testing done after the first CP and everything came back normal.

My current RE is basically [this](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/05/us/05onfire1_xp/05onfire1_xp-master768-v2.jpg) when I ask for more testing. She has suggested doing an ERA but the clinic doesn't believe that immunology has enough data behind it to warrant looking into (I have psoriasis and it flares when I get pregnant). She also tells me that I am still within the range of normal amount of cycles required to get pregnant. She wants me to just do another FET. I have one more attempt left with my insurance.

I went for a second opinion with my four inch thick stack of medical records and within five minutes the doctor said that my TSH was too high, my RPL panel only covered acquired issues and not hereditary,  I need immunological testing, and once all of that testing was done I should do another fresh cycle, test all of the embryos, ERA, then FET. Basically she said everything I wanted her to, but now I feel almost as if we're starting over and that stresses me out. 

My husband is ready to switch but I'm hesitant because the other clinic's SART scores are much lower than my current clinic (30% vs. 50%).

I've been reflecting on my last year as a 20-something year old. At my 29th birthday, we were firmly in TFAB territory. My SO and I were in a really good place in our relationship. I'm not sure I can still say that with such certainty. I always just assumed it would happen for me (just like everyone else here) but never a hint of a positive in one year of actively trying. In July, we found out we had to do IVF/ICSI. What a kick in the face. I was shocked and messed up about it for a long time.

What have I learned about myself since then? I like to hide from people when I'm dealing with difficult things. Miscarrying was the hardest thing I have ever done. There was so much hope in that little embryo and I literally flushed it down the toilet. I'm stronger than I thought. I've given myself 30+ injections and taken hundreds of pills that mess me up emotionally and physically. My need for independence was confirmed. So independent that I took misoprostol by myself. That didn't go over well. I'm depressed. I recognize it, that I'm becoming a shell of who I was. I don't find joy in the things I used to. Half of the last year was spent ""willing it to happen"". I never imagined my life without kids and now I'm starting to think about adopting or foster. What is wrong with our embryos?

A quick recap, I don't ovulate and husband has below average sperm (but not too terrible!) RE reckons we're now probably looking at me having shitty eggs too. Great!

But there is good news. We're at the top of the list for a funded cycle. We'll be starting that in March so I'm back on the pill to get ready. We're also going to be doing a new time lapse morphometry imaging (if there is a spot available at collection). Basically the embryos are put in an incubator which takes regular photos. RE doesn't care about the regular photos but thinks not disturbing the embryos to check up on them might help their development.

I asked about all the additional testing (I hunted down all the mentions of extra testing on here so thanks!!) and gave up 5 or 6 vials of blood yesterday. I wish I'd taken note of everything that was listed but I forgot. Also RE has me starting on melatonin to improve egg quality.

We're also going back to antagonist protocol from our first round (2nd switched up to menopur to which I barely responded and this latest round was flare protocol). Strangely during IVF1 I had more follicles, more eggs, more embryos but low estrogen (which is why we've been fiddling). We fixed the estrogen in the last round but had shittier follicles, eggs, embryos. Go figure. And we're going to double trigger and push collection out to the end of the 36-38 hour collection window in case some of my eggs were still stuck to their follicles. 

Pretty much we've got two more rounds and if the results are still shitty we're pretty much at the end of our run. We were told that if we wanted to go down the donor egg route we have to find our own donor (and we don't know anyone who we could ask) so we'd have to advertise and hope someone suitable volunteered.

**Update from urologist who sent me an email: 
Low sperm morphology was seen.

There is a lot of debate among fertility specialists about the clinical usefulness of morphology (shape) measurement.
Some people think it is a very important measure. Others, like me, find that it's not a very helpful measure because almost everyone I see has a low morphology, so the test loses meaning for me for the most part, unless one particular bad factor was seen like round-headed sperm or headless sperm. Taken in isolation, I don't think strict morphology is a strong predictor for fertility or not. Literature supports and refutes the usefulness of morphology in different studies. In one study men with 0-4% morphology had more pregnancies than couples with >14% morphology. This tells us morphology may not be a good predictor for fertility chances, really.

Out of the millions of sperm in the sample, the lab looks at about 200 to estimate the morphology. If they count 8 that are strictly normal by the strictest measures, and not abnormal in any one category ( head size, head shape, nose shape, midpiece, straight tail, etc) then you have a ""normal"" sample with 4% strictly normal morphology. If they count 6 normal ones, you have 3% normal morphology, etc. It is just SINGLE DIGIT numbers they are counting to estimate the morphology, it is not a thorough sampling, really, just an estimate. I very rarely see morphology over 6% in anyone.

There is no particular therapy for isolated low morphology. I recommend over-the-counter fertility supplements, though the evidence these help a ton is slim. Otherwise lifestyle modifications: stop smoking, avoid excess alcohol, avoid heat exposure, and such.

We were trying without help for 6 months before we got married and probably a year while we were married. 

Most of the fertility issues are on me, I have both PCOS and Endo (suspected). I only fit a few symptoms of PCOS and do not feel like I belong in the PCOS subs because I have periods monthly, I am not diabetic or pre-diabetic and I am not obese. 

I had an HSG test done and everything was go to go so my gyno/ob decided to put me on Clomid 50mg, for 3 months, without any luck. It did however get all the eggs out of my ovaries, so she decided to up the dosage to 100mg on the 4th month. That was way too much and caused more cysts to form and have fluid sitting in my ovaries and tubes. 

At this point I freaked because it was obviously more serious than I was expecting. Me, hubby and the gyno decided to not do the clomid ever again (she even refused to try it again) and within a week I was getting a more permanent birth control put in to control the cysts. 

May of last year I got nexplanon put in and was suppose to have 3 years on it without any major issues and all was good until January. It just ""failed"" (by failed I mean it quit working to help my periods and pain) I was in bed for 3 days before my period started and the two days while the period was there, I had bad uterus pain which i assume was the Endo. 

2 weeks ago I went to the RE doctor in my area that was recommended to me, and she ran some blood tests. I got the results back and after reading them I am now freaking out that my time is running out. My AMH levels are low, which explains why we couldn't get pregnant but with my confirmed diagnosis of PCOS, it is suppose to be high. 

I went over the results with my gyno/ob and am going to the RE doctor tomorrow. 

Questions: 
I am 25, is it common to be dealing with this right now? 
Should I be worried about not being able to have kids? 
Is there anyone out there that has PCOS and is dealing with low AMH levels? 

I just feel like I am about to fight a losing battle, and am currently trying to decide if all this is worth it or not.

I want to be able to go back next week and say A) you're wrong, and/or B) you made me feel bad about this. 

She also said that I should be sure to try this month because HSGs can help you get pregnant and asked if I was putting my legs up after intercourse, because her ""other patient had an HSG, then tried that month and put her legs up and got pregnant!"". Gee wiz, I hadn't thought of that. You mean all I need to do is stay calm, have sex, and put my legs in the air and that should do the job better than ovulation kits, and clomid and injections and my three IVF cycles or upcoming IUI and everything that all fucking entails???!!!

She has hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to turn against the thyroid gland. We knew this before we ever got married - she was diagnosed in her early twenties. What we didn't know is that hashimoto's can also affect the reproductive system. After two years of taking temperatures, careful timing, and several failed IUIs, we finally did some research of our own and asked her doctor to do CD 3 testing. Knowing what we know now, I'm still furious that he put us through all those IUIs without ever having done CD 3 testing, but it is what it is. The results came back as severely diminished (as in undetectable) ovarian reserve.

We talked about options and it's important to her to carry a baby herself - she wants nothing more in the world. So we went to meetings and talked to specialists and decided to go down the IVF route. With her ovarian reserve in the state it was in, we figured it would be ridiculous to try and retrieve any of her own eggs. So we picked a donor. She was new to the program and very young, but she had a kid of her own so she was proven fertile and we liked what we read on the bio we were provided, plus she kind of looked similar to my wife, so we chose her.

Two days before the scheduled retrieval, someone from the fertility clinic called and told us that it wasn't going to happen. They were very vague on the details but apparently our donor had contracted an STD, and she'd be blacklisted from any donation program for a year as a result.

This was a bad time for my wife and me, understandably, but the clinic was very accommodating and offered us a bunch of free meds and services for a new donor of our choosing (I guess this kind of situation was sort of unprecedented). We quickly chose a different donor, one who'd been through a cycle before and was in the middle of her second at the time.

From there, everything happened really fast. She wasn't a new donor so no need for the screening processes that held us up before. Retrieval day came and went, then I made my contribution, and when all was said and done we ended up with seven frozen embryos. Which is phenomenal, from everything I've read in general and from our donor's past cycles in particular (both ended up with four frozen embryos).

Now transfer day is upon us, and I've been silently freaking out for the past two weeks. It got to the point where her doctor told me to stop reading things online because I was getting into research/hypothetical papers and it was stuff that wouldn't really do us any good in the here and now.

I'm worried that it won't take. I'm worried that it will take and that we'll lose it during pregnancy. We haven't even gotten to the MC stage yet because she's never been able to get pregnant in the first place. We have seven to work with, which is incredible, but I'm over here wondering at what point do we stop trying to have her carry a baby herself and start thinking about a surrogate? After two? Three? Four?

I'm not really voicing any of this to her because I know it's important that she remain as stress-free and relaxed as possible, but she knows I'm a worrier. Now our first FET is tomorrow so I'm venting here while she sleeps.

She's also self-conscious about any potential babies not having any genetic ties to her (has to do with the way she was raised herself and the way her family treated her) and I try to comfort her but in the end there's only so much I can say because my DNA is accounted for, after all.

I dunno. I'm worried it won't take, I'm worried it will. Every bad case scenario is constantly running through my mind. I tear up during diaper commercials, lol.

Especially in my situation. I hope men are still welcome here.

Backstory, this is our second go-round. We (M35, F32) were here before (my wife used to actually be an active participant of this sub) - started trying 2012, miscarriage 2013, diagnosis of unexplained IF/LPD --> 2014 letrozole IUI x 3, follistim IUI cancelled, IVF (follistim/ganirelix/menopur) with complete fertilization failure followed by a spontaneous pregnancy while planning IVFx2-->healthy child for which we are very grateful.  The problem is that because it was spontaneous and the prior IVF failure, we have no frozen embryos to work with. In the interim we moved to upstate NY and changed insurances (we have no IF coverage) but are in a slightly better financial position which will be helpful.

We met with new RE today, which was a bit rocky as he didn't seem to get the idea of billing under a different ICD 10 code to help get our diagnostics covered and seemed dismissive re the finances of it all.  I'm a doctor (cardiologist) and couldn't believe this attitude, which got my wife really ticked off. The finance people were a bit confused as well but the nurses were somewhat helpful.  The clinic is decked out like the W hotel (CNY fertility), which was a bit jarring.  But I've learned that none of that shit matters including whether we ""love"" the RE - it's all about science, clinic communication, and more than a bit of luck and getting a healthy child and hopefully not going broke.

I'm not sure how many second-timers are on here but two other impressions have definitely hit.
1. As IF veterans, we are more savvy and less intimidated and definitely less blindly optimistic.  But being a veteran doesn't alleviate the ptsd sensations - the day after day waiting, the up and down disappointment, the conversion of sex to a task, the jealousy.
2.  In some ways there is definitely less of an emotional edge. On the other hand, I get asked about a second child almost daily by random people with no hesitation.  And people (including close family) tend to assume that we are ""cured"" of IF and give some story of ""my friend had ivf the first and then got pregnant after a month of trying with their second"" etc. While this is true for some couples, NOT for us.

She's always been like a sister to me. She always thought she could never conceive and has been through a few nasty lady procedures in her life, one very recently. I would never wish fertility issues on her or anyone, but the working assumption has always been they'd never have kids. So while I'm happy for her, I'm totally blindsided by this.

She told us by writing a very thoughtful letter; we're the first to receive the news. She knows how hard it is going to be for us, and I must say, her telling us in advance of the family, and by heartfelt, hand-written letter was really sensitive. It's really the best way to receive the news and I'm grateful for that.

Hubs is working so I can't tell him while he's already stressed. Obviously can't tell my mom because it's not my news to share. And the only two friends I can talk to are currently unavailable... so I'm writing here.

I just needed to get it all out. I'm happy for her, and absolutely crushed for me. Our grandparents are old and declining, and I was so excited to tell them about our baby, right before we lost it in September.

And now all I can think about is that she will get to share her news with them someday very soon. I'm happy they'll have a great grandchild, and so sad that I couldn't be the one to give that to them. 

We all agreed as a family that it was best to not share our 18week loss with the grandparents... to save them the pain. And now I'm regretting that. I want them to know how close we were, and how excited we were to be parents and make them great grandparents.

I&#39;m happy they&#39;ll have a great grandchild, and so sad that I couldn&#39;t be the one to give that to them. </p>

<p>We all agreed as a family that it was best to not share our 18week loss with the grandparents... to save them the pain. And now I&#39;m regretting that. I want them to know how close we were, and how excited we were to be parents and make them great grandparents. I&#39;m jealous of her and that she&#39;ll get to share the news with them and see the reactions I had imagined seeing.</p>

<p>Phew, this kinda sucks. Let the drinking commence.</p>

Positive, my BF's numbers are all looking good. He's fit for the job.

Considering that we were referred to IVF/PGD because of my genetic disorder, it is a relief to know we don't have to add any additional concerns coming from his side. 

Not so positive. My AMH is low (9), and my FSH is high (12).

Apologies for the long post. It's my first time here. 
My husband [35M] has two younger brothers. Both of them have wives that just gave birth and they are holding a joint christening next week which his entire family will be attending.
This is a difficult situation for me because I'm 37, I've never been pregnant, and we've been TTC for a little over a year now with no luck. I had 2 Depo Provera shots in the months before we started trying and I got my period back within 2 months of it ""wearing off"" but who knows if the Depo affected my fertility somehow or not. I was examined last June and the gyno didn't seem to think I'd have any trouble getting pregnant despite the Depo or my age--no PCOS, no cysts, etc. She sent me home saying come back next year (because she expected I'd be pregnant by now, I think). I'm going to be returning for more tests quite soon.
My husband had his sperm tested last month and although the doctor said everything looked good, I noticed the morphology was 1% which I've heard can be bad. But he already has one child, age 10, with an ex-girlfriend. The ex got pregnant almost immediately after they started dating and he caught her cheating not long after the child was born, but apparently no one ever questioned/tested paternity because the child looks exactly like my husband. I must say I think the child does look like him and so I've been assuming the child is his. This means my fertility, or lack thereof, is probably the issue. It hurts me damn near unbearably each and every day knowing I'm the only one that doesn't have a child of my own.
I know time isn't on my side anymore and I always feel like I'm on the outside looking in. I don't have to tell you ladies just how hard it is to see babies seemingly coming to everyone around you and for whatever reason you're being left out. I don't know if I'll ever be a mother. I only know it's what I most want to be.
All that having been said, this christening event is about my SILs and their babies. It's about coming together and celebrating their incredible good fortune and happiness, and it's nothing but utter selfishness for me to be standing by struggling with a tidal wave of negative emotions the entire time. I'm afraid I won't present myself well that day but for their sakes I would very much like to. 
None of them know what I'm going through because we've kept the whole thing private. Not only is there a language barrier but there's also the fact that I'm simply not close to either SIL (I've seen them both probably three times total before this) and I wouldn't want to lay this on them even if I could. This day is about them and their families and I want that to be the focus 100%. 
Me just not attending is not really an option.
I guess what I'm getting at is (albeit in a totally long-winded way) does anyone have any tips for navigating this type of situation? I don't want to go to pieces. I want to try and be as graceful and as happy for them as is possible and I hope that comes across. Any advice you can offer is most welcome.

<p>I am also wondering about working while on the treatment... how do you tell your boss you might miss work?

Last cycle we did back to back IUIs with clomid, fsh and a trigger shot also progesterone suppositories after IUI. On Cd11 after finishing clomid and my first  two fsh injections I had an 18mm follicle and a 12 and 9mm as well. I triggered two days later and IUIs took place on cd14 and cd15. Husbands counts the first day post wash were 34 mil, 52% motility. Second day was 66mil 71% motility. So I felt pretty good about our chances, let myself get my hopes up and it failed. That cycle cost us close to two grand. 

This cycle I opted to do just clomid (50mg), trigger and Timed intercourse because my husband and I talked and decided we didn't want to spend another 2k just yet. Last cycle was hard on both of us too. Today was CD11. I took clomid cd5-9. Two good follicles today, 17mm and 19mm. 

So my question is, do you think it's worth the money it to do IUIs with no MFI? The doctor says my issue is weak ovulation/low progesterone. I see her on march 1st and I'll discuss everything with her then, but I'd like to her your opinions as well.

Well, a lot more coverage than I had before, which was zilch.  I would still have to pay for my meds, but they'd cover any procedures a certain number of attempts.

My husband and I had accepted that it wasn't going to happen.  We've made plans about traveling in a couple of years now that my step-daughter is almost in highschool.  It was really tough to get to the happy post-no baby infertility struggle, but it's also been a  huge relief to not be poked and prodded and a slave to my cycle.  I'm also older than I wanted to get pregnant.  I'll be 35 in a couple of months.  I know that isn't old, but it's not super young either, and I'd be classified as high risk due to some other health risks.  

But now I know that between making an extra 17k a year (Yeah, my new job rocks!) and insurance covering a huge chunk, it's possible again. We had to quit because we couldn't afford it.

Names are standing out to me again.  ""Oh, that would be a great boys name!  What a wonderful girls name!""  That kind of thing.  Daydreams are slipping in.  Of being pregnant and of having a kid who actually calls me mom.  Then the reminder of diapers and crying and lack of sleep come through my mind and I ask myself if I really want to start the process all over again with no guarantee.

<p>My husband and I had accepted that it wasn&#39;t going to happen.  We&#39;ve made plans about traveling in a couple of years now that my step-daughter is almost in highschool.  It was really tough to get to the happy post-no baby infertility struggle, but it&#39;s also been a  huge relief to not be poked and prodded and a slave to my cycle.  I&#39;m also older than I wanted to get pregnant.  I&#39;ll be 35 in a couple of months.  I know that isn&#39;t old, but it&#39;s not super young either, and I&#39;d be classified as high risk due to some other health risks.  </p>

<p>Names are standing out to me again.  &quot;Oh, that would be a great boys name!  What a wonderful girls name!&quot;  That kind of thing.  Daydreams are slipping in.  Of being pregnant and of having a kid who actually calls me mom.  Then the reminder of diapers and crying and lack of sleep come through my mind and I ask myself if I really want to start the process all over again with no guarantee.

My husband (Mr. T) and I are both 28, healthy, and we've been trying to have a baby since October 2015. I always had periods every 30-32 days, so we were convinced that conceiving would be easy for us (ha!). That clearly was not the case. An HSG in August 2016 showed a potential left tube blockage, but they aren't sure if it's an actual blockage or just a spasm from the procedure. RE doesn't want to do a laparoscopy just yet because he feels like we have a chance to get pregnant while avoiding surgery. Mr. T's SA shows great count and motility, but a morphology of 2%. My bloodwork comes back with slightly high AMH (8.6 ng/mL), low progesterone (8.7), and slightly high fasting insulin. RE says I display some characteristics of PCOS, but I ovulate regularly (even though it's a ""weak"" ovulation based on my progesterone levels), and my ultrasounds show clear ovaries, no sign of any cysts whatsoever.

First Clomid cycle: 50mg for five days, unmonitored (due to holiday travel). Result: negative.

Second Clomid cycle: 50mg for five days, monitored. CD12 ultrasound showed multiple follicles, but the biggest was only 12mm, so the plan was to ""stair-stepped"" me up to 100mg of Clomid for 5 more days and check again. On my second day of 100mg Clomid, I got a positive OPK. The nurse thinks initially that it's a false positive, but it continues to show up on different brands, so they determine that my body is ovulating regardless of whether the follicles are mature enough, so I shouldn't use my Ovidrel shot this cycle because ""it would be a waste."" CD21 progesterone check is 19.6, which is a huge improvement for me. Result: negative.

Third Clomid Cycle: 100mg for eight days, monitored. CD3 ultrasound shows no cysts, good lining, and over 20 follicles on each side at the proper size. I experienced a constant, dull ache on my right side for a few days. CD12 ultrasound shows one 23mm follicle on the right side (hence the ache) and a couple of 13mm follicles on the left side. Mr. T gives me my Ovidrel injection last night and we're still in the ""frantically having sex over the next three days"" phase of this cycle. I'm trying to find that balance of being hopeful without getting my hopes up too high this time around.

Has anyone else out there had issues with ""immature follicles"" but they still ovulate? Everyone at my RE's office seemed so surprised last cycle (not really a comforting feeling, even though I know these people rock) and I can't seem to find anything out there in the vast Google-land about immature follicles without it also talking about PCOS and cysts (which I've never had). 

Also, side rant: during the time we've been trying to have a baby, we've added two nieces and a nephew to the family.

My husband and I started trying in January of 2016. I went off birth control, after which I never got a period. Many tests later, I was diagnosed with PCOS, which then got rediagnosed as an ""ovulation disorder,"" as I don't have any markers of PCOS aside from not ovulating. 

We've so far done 4 TI Clomid cycles, one of which was accompanied by a trigger shot. Then, since my lining was shit, they switched me to Femara with a trigger for a TI cycle. 

Then we moved onto IUI. I had one canceled cycle (due to a cyst) and one failed IUI with femara and a trigger. Now, I'm on my second IUI cycle. My follicles have always been slow to develop (with medication I'll typically ovulate around day 21-25). However, this time, my follicles seemed especially stubborn. Thus, my doctor initially had me take a half shot of menopur for three days. I went back in for an US, and my follicles were the same size, still. Then, I took a full shot of menopur for two consecutive days, only to be met with an US showing no growth. They're having me do two more shots of Menopur, and I'll go back in on Monday. 

Has anyone else had an experience like this? I have no idea why after 6 medicated cycles my follicles are just refusing to budge. I feel like I'm losing hope for this cycle, and now I'm spiraling out that my body has stopped responding to meds. I'm also worried it's just going to end up being canceled after we've already spent over $1k on meds and ultrasounds.

So this month was my first medicated cycle. I've been diagnosed as ""on the spectrum"" with PCOS (29-45 day cycles, AMH of 7). My husband has mild MFI with a 19 million/mL sperm count, 40% motility and 2% morph. 

My RE started me at 2.5mg Femara and an Ovidrel trigger this month. I went in on CD 11 and I only had one dominant follicle at 11cm. Went in 3 days later and it was 14mm, then two days later it was 16mm. They asked me to come back in 2 days but I could not - five ultrasounds in two weeks was just too much for me, considering I have a 24 ultrasound LIFETIME max on my insurance - and I'm a nurse who works 12 hour shifts and it is hell trying to get shifts moved around. 

Due to my resistance to get ultrasound #5 when obviously the low dose Femara did nothing and my one follicle was growing at 1mm per day, they told me to take OPKs at home at 10am each day until positive, then trigger at 3pm - which I did at CD 18 (yesterday). 

Their instruction was to trigger on the day of the positive opk but still not have sex until about 30 hours after, on the night of CD 19, tonight. 

Instead, I had sex the night of the trigger (last night), following a natural positive OPK, and very early this morning, because my husband is a firefighter and is working tonight. I'm worried about my timing, but also curious if moving up intercourse was the best thing to do, considering my opk was positive naturally. 

Do you know the rationale behind waiting till 36 hours total beyond the positive opk to have sex? It makes more sense just only wait until 30 hours after Ovidrel if one had not had a natural positive opk before hand.

Here's a little background info.
My wife had two miscarriages in her early twenties, one of which was an ectopic pregnancy. She has never carried to term.

Since 2015 she/we have had two miscarriages (the last one was ectopic pregnancy. (That's a miscarriage too, right?))
We have now been told by an infertility doctor that her tubes might be messed up and given the fact that she has had two ectopic pregnancies her risk for having another is now significantly higher. If she were to have another ectopic pregnancy, the risks are severe, even death.

Here is what we know for sure from the doctors last examination.
1. My wife's ovaries and uterus are healthy.
2. Something may be wrong with her tubes but we won't know for sure until she has a procedure (Hysterosalpingography?) next month.
3. IVF has been suggested by the infertility doctor as the ""only"" and safest option for us to conceive.
4. Given the cost of IVF and percentage of failure to conceive, we feel that we can't even consider it at this point.

Now, my wife is putting her faith in expensive and unscientific methods to ""cleanse"" her Fallopian tubes, uterus and ovaries. Such as ""Healthy Fallopion"" kits, acupuncture, reflexology and Chinese herbs and minerals to remove the ""toxins"" from her body.

I'm a medical professional and approach most things with a scientific, dispassionate mind. I read and follow studies. I have a general distaste for all things ""holistic"" due to their untested nature and denial of the validity of modern medicine.

That having been said, I'm fully supportive of my wife and want the best for her, but I don't want to throw money peace-meal at homeopathic remedies if we should be saving our money for an eventual attempt at IVF!

I would love to here from any of you that have had positive PERSONAL experiences from alternative therapies for womb-health prior to pregnancy.
Bonus points if you have had a similar experience to what we are having and can offer some wisdom!

(I asked before if she thought I should see a RE, but she just pulled a face and seemed to think she could handle the work-up.) Just before Christmas she delivered results saying I had bilateral hydrosalpinx and an abnormally shaped, small uterus. She said next stop was a RE who would remove both tubes and go straight to IVF. I was really confused at that point because immediately following the HSG the radiologist assistant told me the left tube had filled and spilled right away. The right was blocked, but did eventually spill. Even though I was devastated with the OBGYN's results, I felt like we finally had an answer as to why nothing was happening.

Ended up with an RE in a big city. All my blood work, FSH, and AMH were good. He read all the reports from my OBGYN and said IVF was likely the course. He wanted to do an HSN. I had that yesterday. He had a really, really hard time placing the catheter. Said the opening from my cervix to uterus was very small. He said he couldn't look at things prior to inserting the saline because of this. (I did have an ultrasound with my initial blood work.) After the saline was inserted he seemed really surprised. He said my uterus looked normal. The OBGYN HSG showed a t-shape, but he didn't see that at all. He said both tubes had fluid, but said it was saline he put there. He felt it was spilling into the cavity. He said my ovaries also looked great. After the test he felt we should consider trying IUI instead of going straight to IVF, but was open to our decision since we are paying out of pocket.

I was too in shock to ask many questions. Has anyone had conflicting results like this? I trust my RE, more than my OBGYN at this point. But can HSN really give you a good idea of the status of fallopian tubes? I am really happy about the HSN results, but confused now that I am back in the unexplained category. I do have a family history of endo. I am just worried we will start IUI or IVF having missed something that we need to take care of before trying. Plus being completely out of pocket, I am scared we will hit our financial cut off before we get to attempts that have the potential for success if we are missing something. Maybe I should ask for laparoscopy? Or a second opinion?

187,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"The ""Angry at Feminism"" thread really got me thinking about mandatory IF treatment and the right to motherhood being as important as the right not to be a mother.  I almost put this post in that thread, but thought it veered a too far from the important discussion about the need for thoughts on IF from a feminist perspective..and it got way too long.  

I began thinking about mandatory IF treatment last month when a talking with a close family member who might have to have IVF next year. She lives in a country which covers IF/ IVF treatment as part of national health care, which is awesome.  She agreed it was wonderful, but then sighed as she told me the story of an old friend of hers who just had twins after 4 rounds of IVF. This woman is unemployed and her ""boyfriend"" is a criminal in constant trouble with the law.  The woman actually has no way to support these twins except with govt. assistance. By the time the twins were born the father was on the run from the authorities again and in hiding. Then I thought back to mentally ill Octo-Mom and her absurd abuse of IVF treatments and then expecting CA for support her dozen plus kids. 
 
I had always thought IF treatment should be covered by insurance but had never considered the downside to that coverage. It immediately veers towards slippery slope argument territory.  How do you ensure mandatory IF treatment isn't misused? Or will misuse/abuse of it just go with the territory? I mean medicaid is abused constantly but it gets more complex when the treatment involves creating children to raise and nurture. I did my internship at CPS and it enraged me how many totally unprepared women had children for the absolute worst reasons. These children ended up in foster care and the woman would just have another to replace it, wash, rinse, repeat.  I remember teenagers lamenting they had not got pregnant (yet) because once they had a baby they would qualify for Section 8 and be able to have their own apartment - motherhood would make them ""someone"" and bestowed a status/ attention in their communities. They wanted a baby because it got them a free apartment, made them an ""adult,"" (the idea of a job to get an apartment didn't seem to enter their minds). Also, since many came from abusive backgrounds they thought of a baby as someone who would always love them and couldn't leave. It was so so sad and depressing. I can promise you these same women would have lied and demanded IF treatment in order to get a baby asap. Yet, it would be considered bigotry to have any type of standards for women who wanted IF treatment if it was mandated.  Having minimum requirements like financial stability, maturity/age, etc.. would be viewed as bigotry against poor and/or young women. 

Of course, I admit I'm very bitter and cynical after working at CPS and its probably skewed my thinking.  I would happily endorse mandatory BC for everyone until they can pass basic tests proving they would be a capable parent.  The irony is everyone I've ever known undergoing IF treatments would be top notch parents. It's one of life's great ironies that these couples who would be such wonderful parents struggle to conceive whereas the totally unprepared, unstable, selfish women I was assigned by CPS to monitor should have never been mothers, yet had babies like rabbits. (Apologies to rabbits) 

I'm not sure how the situation could reasonably be handled if IF coverage was mandatory (under insurance AND medicaid) to prevent abuse or if you just must accept the abuse/misuse of it by some in order to help the many. I don't think it's possible to have a discussion about who is ""worthy"" or prepared to be parents without a whole dump truck of classist assumptions, racism, bigotry and judgements coming along for the ride.  

When I worked at CPS there was a woman who was mildly mentally retarded.  She had six children, five were in foster care and the youngest still with her.  She didn't like ""children"" she just liked babies, so once her babies became toddlers she lost interest because she ""couldn't hold them"" like a baby doll anymore.  She was a terrible mother that needed constant monitoring and help to ensure the babies in her custody survived. She did not have the intellectual capabilities to see the problem with her behavior. We couldn't get her sterilized because of fear of lawsuits and discrimination against mentally disabled people. (The history of mandatory sterilization for mentally ill/ disabled people in this country 75 years ago had caused a swing to the polar opposite) We had to secretly get her on nexplanon (and paid out of our own pocket) to get around the system which wouldn't allow it due to fear of accusations of discrimination.  It was an all around tragedy - and her children were the ones who suffered the most.   This is how much social service agencies feared the slippery slope of who should or shouldn't be a mother - even in a case where it was stunningly obvious that this woman should not be having children and had no ability to care for them.  

The above is a extreme case, but in regards to mandatory IF treatment a good scenario would be a young, single, unemployed, high school drop out who desperately wants a baby, and might be a very loving mother but can't financially support a child and would require govt. benefits to raise the child until it is 18. (in the real world it seems such women are usually absurdly fertile, but lets say this imaginary one suffers from IF). Would it be unjust to deny her fertility treatment based on her financial inability to support a child? You could argue it would be unfair to the child and taxpayers, but that won't get you very far.  Other women like her have children so why should she be denied the opportunity due to a medical condition. 

On the other hand you have plenty of women/couples who could support a child and raise a child in a very loving home, but they just don't have the extra $25K to undergo IVF treatment. It's  terrible Catch-22.  Do you accept the former in order to assist the latter? 

The more I've thought about the subject the more complex it gets. I just wondered if I was blind to some obvious solution or if there simply is no solution.  Mandatory IF treatment would simply have to take the good with the bad and be totally blind to any judgements about who or wouldn't be a ""good"" parent because it's not up to insurance/govt. to decide such matters (and they have a pretty bad history in that regard).  There are already millions unprepared, unsuitable parents who have children naturally and the number that would be added thanks to mandatory IF treatment would probably be a drop in the bucket.  But mandatory IF treatment would definitely help the many women/couples out there that want to be and would be wonderful, loving parents.  A case of the possible good far outweighs the potential for abuse. 

There may already be a wealth of information on this subject since some govt. do mandate IF treatment, if so I'd be curious to read it. And apologies if this subject has already been discussed here but I just had not seen a thread about it in the last year when I tried to search. 

I'm very interested in the thoughts on the matter from others, esp from people who have had to slog through the emotional and financial trenches of IF treatment.  I wondered how it would feel to go through the struggle and pain, being uber-responsible, working extra hard to earn and save to get IF treatment only for it suddenly to be a freebie for any person below the poverty line who qualifies for medicaid?

I’ve been thinking a lot about what has happened recently to make me dislike feminism so much. A lot of it is just my political and moral aversion to “white feminism,” which I detest for so many reasons and which may or may not be connected to my second point, which is personal: 

I feel like I’ve been in my hour of need for years now and feminism is nowhere to be found. If I wanted/needed to have an abortion, not have an abortion, breast-feed, not breast-feed, stay home with a kid, not stay home with a kid, get paid maternity leave, get paid paternity leave, feminism would have my back with 1000 articles and slogans and websites and supportive narratives for why that is a great choice. But infertility? Facing a devastating, gendered medical diagnosis, with no insurance coverage, while battling bullshit misogynistic social narratives at every turn? Fuck you kid, you’re on your own.

I did a literature search once for feminist theory and infertility, and you know what I  found? An academic feminist’s paper about how IVF is a tool of the patriarchy because it colludes politically weak women into ""breeding."" FUCKING THANKS. Last year, the leftist magazine the Baffler had an article, written by a woman, about how sad and weird it is for couples to pursue donor eggs, and it ended with a sanctimonious “just adopt” anecdote about some lady who adopted like 8 special-needs kids from foster care. AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY. It’s not just that feminism doesn’t have my back, it’s that I don’t have to look hard to find feminists actually shitting on me.

Last year I made a new friend (Jessie), who has quickly become very dear to me. She introduced me to another friend of hers (Taylor), and though I never met this person, we talked over chat frequently. Taylor knew about my infertility and IVF, one day she approached me about her own struggles trying to get pregnant. She had been trying for more than a year and had a history that indicated she may have had uterine or fallopian tube scarring. I listened and encouraged her to see a doctor. This conversation was lengthy and really touched me on a personal level. Some time went on and we didn't talk as much in chat but would email from time to time. 

Anyway, a few weeks ago Jessie told me that Taylor is pregnant. No medical intervention, just took a bit longer than normal I suppose. I was devastated and immediately began crying. All I could think was ""why not me?"" Lord knows I have put in enough work between 8 IUIs, one major surgery, and 3 IVF cycles, it's not fair! And I know how childish this is, but damn. 

Since finding out she is pregnant, Taylor has not talked to me even once. I was hoping she would reach out and tell me herself, so we could have that conversation, but no. I'm hurt and angry. The conversation we had really meant something and I thought we had bonded in that moment, obviously it meant nothing to her. Every night now, I think about her and her pregnancy and get insanely jealous and am moved now to tears. And it's not just her pregnancy of course, it's the loss of somebody who I thought had become a friend, somebody I did care about. If it wasn't for Jessie, I would forget about Taylor and move on, but I can't do that because they are very close. It's put me in a weird situation where I am stuck in this shitty position and I don't know what to do. Nobody else I know in real life would understand these emotions. I wish I could just be happy for her, but I can't when she won't even talk to me. I feel like she only cared when she thought I could support HER through her own problems, and doesn't actually give a shit about mine.

I thought once I stopped I'd get my period right away but it doesn't even feel like it's coming any time soon! I have an appointment on Thursday for my baseline ultrasound and blood work, so do they will go ahead if I'm like CD1 that day?

I am new, my sister recommend I come here for support and guidance.

My husband and I had our blood/semen tests last week and saw the OBGYN yesterday.

Turns out while hubby's sperm is perfect, I have great hormones... but high progesterone.

Was told I didn't ovulate that cycle, and as my periods are irregular (either early or late each time by about 4 days either side), I either ovulate irregularly or never.

Feeling pretty gutted - why do I get awful (painful, long, heavy, disgusting) periods (that are more often early than late)- for no egg???

It's like being forced to go to church on Easter and get no chocolate eggs. Where are my eggs??? I put in the hard yards (blood, sweat and tears, literally)!

So, anyone else in this situation? Have you conceived since?

I am on clomid 50mg for 3 months to make me ovulate, and if that does not work the OBGYN will do a laparoscopy to check if I have any blockages (I have past endo).

Oh - to top it all off, I have cervical dysplasia, so a possible future of cervix cutting.

Snip snip!

This rubs me the wrong was as initially I was told to lose because it could hinder tests, due to the anesthesiologist, for overall health, etc. Not once was it mentioned that weight can impair implantation and the number of other plus size women getting pregnant seems to go against that.

I've had incredibly painful periods since menarche, throwing up, passing out, the works. Controlled it with birth control for 10+ years. When I went off hormonal birth control I had horrible daily pain, bloating, etc etc and excruciating periods (back to throwing up and blacking out). I've had two excision surgeries, and am doing much much better since then, with no daily pain and somewhat painful periods which I can control with pain meds.

We got our fert report today and it was a real shock to us.  This was our 3rd retrieval and we've never had attrition at the fertilization stage (our drop-offs have always been day 3 to day 6).  In fact, last IVF, even the M1's managed to fertilize.

This time: 14 eggs retrieved, 5 were GV, 9 looked mature

9 were ICSI'd, 5 'fell apart' with the ICSI pipette (I didn't even know that was a thing) - the eggs were apparently atretic with abnormal cytoplasm

Of the 4 that fertilized, 2 fertilized abnormally and have been discarded.

So we have 2 in the running and our track record isn't so great for getting blastocysts from fertilized eggs, so I think this whole cycle may have been for naught.

I got the news right after dropping Mr.BC off at the airport (he's travelling for work again) and ugly-cried all the way home.  Poor Mr.BC got a one-line text message with the results from me and then boarded the airplane.

I know it's way too raw right now to make any decisions, but I'm thinking we will need to do go back to our SF clinic with our tails between our legs and try to re-create the magic of IVF#1.  Or maybe my eggs have just rotted over the last 12 months and there's really not much more to do.

I promise I read the rules and FAQs) and this is my first post about infertility on the internets (intimidating!). After 7 years on the pill, I stopped Fall of 2014. We started TTC Feb 2015. My cycles were crazy and up to 55 days long and we weren't having any luck.  I tried a few rounds of clomid with my OB but didn't have a ""robust"" response.  I felt super defeated seeing some tech at the OB's office monthly. I didn't understand why my cycles were still so long and I didn't feel like I was being educated. A midwife friend told me about the Creighton Model System so I started seeing a consultant to learn more about tracking my signs of fertility (I started tracking cervical mucus (CM)).  I also read Taking Charge of Your Fertility and Zita West's Eat Yourself Pregnant to learn more about how conception works. I started seeing a Creighton/NaPro doctor Fall 2015 and was diagnosed with PCOS. Dr said labs weren't slam-dunk PCOS, but long cycles and classic string of pearl ovaries were. Using Femara we got my cycles shorter, started taking supplements for CM including mucinex, started day 7 progesterone bloods, follicle scans etc. Nothing. Finally, May 2016 I did HSG to check tubes (believe me I am still kicking myself for putting off this test for fear of pain) and discover I have a septate uterus (wall of tissue divided my uterus at the top). We stopped TTC for fear of loss and I had lap surgery July 2016 to remove uterine septum and check for suspected endometriosis. NaPro Dr's claim to train in advanced surgical techniques to minimize scaring, so I felt like I was in great hands. During lap, advanced endo (Dr said 3 on scale from 1-4) was found, and I had full blown (5 small incisions) abdominal, robotic surgery.  With clean tubes (tubes were clear at HSG), endo and uterine septum removed (blood-filled cyst on left ovary was also removed) we were ready to TTC again. Sorry for the additional detail, but I had an extremely traumatic psychological allergic reaction to the narcotics from the surgery - Ultram (Tramadol). Intense anxiety, agitation and suicidal thoughts.  The absolute most hellish 24 hours of my life. My Dr. actually released me from the hospital in this state, thinking I was fatigued from lack of sleep during hospital stay.  When I was still hyperventilating at the drop of a hat at home, hubby and I knew something was wrong and Dr. changed meds. This traumatic experience caused me to loose faith in the Dr. She had also suggested an ovarian wedge resection during the surgery and this recommendation also unsettled me. So Fall 2016 we started seeing RE (RE said previous Dr. ""toasted"" my ovary which freaked me out and new RE kind of laughed at all my CM charting). I'm on a higher dose of Femara and using Ovidrel shot around CD 14, instead of waiting until CD 18 or so when my OPK kits would normally turn + on my own.  RE also did a follow up hysteroscopy Oct 2016 to remove ""widow's peak"" left over from earlier septum resection. I've done the Femara + Ovidrel protocol 3 times since and still nothing.  This RE has shut down my concerns about low progesterone (he says with mature follicle on scan and ovidrel shot, we know I ovulated and that means my progesterone is fine) and poor quality CM (i.e. none, I'm dry as a freaking creek bed). My insurance covers IUI at 90% after I meet my deductible, so we plan to try that 2-16-2017. RE said after IUI my only options would be IVF (insurance does not cover) or another lap to see if the first surgery missed something.

I have found all the forums with the confusing acronyms intimidating. After growing up in an unhappy home and clinging to the belief that I would create my own happy family for as long as I can remember, the emotional pain of infertility is almost too much. That is why I am asking for a fertility Sherpa.  What am I missing?  What tests should I ask for (my insurance covers up to IUI at 90%)?  What hope do I have? I'm here for hope. Educate me please.

Summary: 32 with PCOS, uterine septum and endo removed. Current RE protocol Femara (CD 3-7) + Ovidrel CD 14 with IUI planned. Also, I have the damn basal body temperature thermometer next to my bed, but have yet to start. 

Also, I mentioned I have little EWCM around ovulation.  However, every freaking month about 4 days before my period I get thick, gummy CM like clock work.  This is how I know every time I'm not pregnant.  I get the cloudy, gummy stuff, then one day of amber-colored CM then period spotting starts.  Last concern I have is brown spotting.  I usually have some amber/brown spotting day before period bleeding starts. Then after period I have 3-4 days of brown spotting.

**EDIT:**

Thanks everyone for the positive notes and feedback.  We thought people might get a chuckle but we were really honoured by all the positive comments.  As I sat next to Mrs.bc in the chair with an IV sticking out of her, swathed in electric blankets, we looked at the comments being left and it made us feel great.  Thanks everyone!

The retrieval went pretty well, we got 14 eggs.  Last time we did this we had a huge drop-off so we're hoping for a good fertilization report tomorrow.

<p>So someone tell me, once you trigger you don&#39;t take any more stims right?!</p>

We'd already been trying to conceive for about a year; it wasn't working, and when Zika started to become a real issue, we decided to pull the trigger and move to the U.S.

It's been a HUGE transition period. Reverse culture shock for me (been living abroad for the past 7 years), new culture shock/language barrier for him, and a bunch of logistical stuff to work out with documentation, insurance, long-overdue dental care, etc. But finally we got ourselves to an RE for more extensive testing.

**The present:** According to the doctor, we're ""medically boring."" All blood/hormone numbers normal. No apparent problems with uterus/tubes/ovaries. Sperm count good. No overlapping genetic conditions. Just straight up unexplained.

Last month we did our first IUI - failed. Trying again this month. 12 inches of snow fell yesterday, and boy do I miss those endless 80-degree days in Brazil  :-(

**The future:** This is our plan - if the 3 IUIs don't work, we'll take a few months' break, maybe do some traveling while we think about next steps. I'm undecided if I want to do IVF.

I've found myself somewhat detached and clinical about this whole thing. I really want to have kids, but it's almost like I've distanced my emotions from it - if we're successful, awesome; if not, I know I can still have a happy life. I want it to happen, but I won't be devastated if it doesn't. 

Honestly the most painful part would be fielding the questions from friends/family, especially in Brazil where it's a little less taboo to ask about or comment on a couple's reproductive plans.

I thought I'd seen it all, knew it all, and was prepared for all. But, I've been thrown a curve-ball, and I want your opinions or experience with this. Searching left me with no answers. 

I went in for my baseline Wednesday to get the IVF 3 party started, but I had 2 cysts, one on each ovary. They were about 12-16 in size. I was sent home and told to wait for blood work results and instructions. If they are producing estrogen, we'll have to sit this cycle out and maybe to estrace priming in the luteal phase of this cycle to prevent this from recurring. If they are not, we might proceed. Sounds right, okay. I'm not new to cysts, I make them like no one else. 

My estradiol came back at 72, which isn't high. But my nurse called me and then emailed me with the summary, below:

>So the reason we're not starting is because the ultrasound showed 2 larger follicles on your ultrasound. Normally, this means that your body has already selected two follicles for this particular month to grow. This normally doesn't happen until later in the menstrual cycle, but in your case it happened very early on. 

>The problem with starting injections is that if we started, its very likely that only these two follicles would hog all the drug and grow. 

>We checked an estradiol level and normally this level would be elevated (meaning the follicles are already producing hormone). In your case, the estradiol was still low, so unclear if these are just left overs from a previous cycle or just a bit too early in their growing stage. 

>Dr. recommends still proceeding with the same type of protocol (day 2 start, Gonal F, Menopur, antagonist and Growth hormone), but first we need to assure that 1) these follicles are gone and 2) we prevent the same thing from happening next month. 

>We do this by doing something called ""estrace priming"" where we basically give you oral Estrace in the luteal phase (the second half, after ovulation) of your cycle. When you take the Estrace, it tricks your brain into not pumping out FSH so early on in your cycle, and therefore should prevent these early follicles. 

>But in order to guarantee that you ovulate and the timing of starting the Estrace is correct, we want to trigger ovulation. That is why we want you to come back in a week. If the follicles have grown and your estradiol has risen, we can trigger ovulation and plan to start the estace a week later. Otherwise, if not growing/making hormone, we may have to just follow the cycle and see what happens to these follicles. 


So, you can see, they think these cysts are early follicles and not cysts at all? But the low level of estradiol would seem to indicate they are cysts, right? In the years I've been doing infertility treatment, I've been benched A LOT because of cysts. Like, at least 8 times in 2 years. Could I really just been pre-maturely creating follicles that my previous clinic thought were cysts (previous clinic never tested estradiol)? I do have short cycles at 24-26 days, and I've read DOR women can sometimes have early recruitment. 

I understand why I cannot proceed with the IVF this cycle. If they are cysts, there's a chance they could rupture or damage the ovarian environment. If they are follicles, they'll suck up all the meds. I get all that. What's really throwing me for a loop is the plan for me go back in a week and trigger theses follicles and start estrace priming. Has anyone here ever done anything like that? Not the estrace priming, but the triggering to get rid of them? BCPs are the standard treatment and what my previous clinic always did. I do NOT want BCPs. I was on them for my first IVF, and I was way over suppressed, so I'm glad we're not going that way, this is just a situation I've never dealt with before. What do you guys think?

One last thing, about DHEA. I was on DHEA for all of 2015-16. I had cyst after cyst. After our first IVF failed, I stopped taking it because I didn't think it made a difference and I hate myself and most things while on it. Well, lo and behold, when I went in for my baseline for IVF 2, having not taken DHEA, there were no cysts! My Dr told me to go back on the DHEA for IVF 3, so I did, and now I have theses cysts.

We are using donor sperm so because of that we could do donor IUIs or do another round of donor IVF. Part of me says ""IUI duh!"" because it's cheaper per round and way less medically invasive.

Things seemed to settle down and then... life decided it was time to pile more stress on my plate. In the past 2 weeks:

1) my dad broke his FEMUR when he fell off a little step ladder helping us with our home renovations - not only do I feel terrible about that but now we are waiting on an electrician to finish what my dad can no longer help with... 

2) my great-grandma died. It wasn't unexpected, she was 96, but it still hurts. I am going to miss her so much. 

3) my elderly dog started having incontinence issues again, which makes me sad. And it also exhausts me bc it increases our laundry about 5 times the normal amount. We got a new medication from the vet, after she had a reaction to the first, so hoping it helps but we won't know for awhile. 

4) renovations are moving forward but not as fast as we expected- esp. since the issue in #1 above. We can't start treatment until these are done.  

5) I can't even read the news right now. I am not trying to be political here but this has become such a source of stress for me I have to actively try to disassociate from the current events in this country to cope. But it's proving impossible bc I am a person that always likes to be informed and people know this about me so they always are trying to talk to me about it and it is suspicious/ weird if I am like yeah please don't speak to me about that right now, I am avoiding all news from my hermit hole. Then once I hear something I have to look it up to confirm if it is real. Yep- total dumpster fire, still burning strong. 

I just want to ""check out"" for a solid week, but I can't do this bc I have to save my vacation time and money for treatment. Normal adult responsibilities never stop and my husband is so used to my current level of stress being at critical levels that it is a new normal around here rather than a cause for concern so his support has dropped off. 

I also forgot to mention I have been having trouble sleeping - as I post this at 1 am - and as a result have been struggling getting to work on time which makes me feel like a total basket case who has not one iota of shit together. Not even a little bit together. I am gaining weight, I have not worn make-up in a good 2 months at least, just turning into a sad frump. 

I know this is super whiny and long but it has been too much to post on the daily and I needed to get it out. 

TL;DR Fuck you, life. Your timing sucks.

Things seemed to settle down and then... life decided it was time to pile more stress on my plate. In the past 2 weeks:</p>

<p>1) my dad broke his FEMUR when he fell off a little step ladder helping us with our home renovations - not only do I feel terrible about that but now we are waiting on an electrician to finish what my dad can no longer help with... </p>

<p>2) my great-grandma died. It wasn&#39;t unexpected, she was 96, but it still hurts. I am going to miss her so much. </p>

<p>3) my elderly dog started having incontinence issues again, which makes me sad. And it also exhausts me bc it increases our laundry about 5 times the normal amount. We got a new medication from the vet, after she had a reaction to the first, so hoping it helps but we won&#39;t know for awhile. </p>

<p>4) renovations are moving forward but not as fast as we expected- esp. since the issue in #1 above. We can&#39;t start treatment until these are done.  </p>

<p>5) I can&#39;t even read the news right now. I am not trying to be political here but this has become such a source of stress for me I have to actively try to disassociate from the current events in this country to cope. But it&#39;s proving impossible bc I am a person that always likes to be informed and people know this about me so they always are trying to talk to me about it and it is suspicious/ weird if I am like yeah please don&#39;t speak to me about that right now, I am avoiding all news from my hermit hole. Then once I hear something I have to look it up to confirm if it is real. Yep- total dumpster fire, still burning strong. </p>
