1,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi. I’m new here.  I’m 39 - almost 40.  I was on the pill for approximately 17 years and went off it in December 2016 as my partner and I were ready to start trying.  I had a withdrawal bleed on January 1 of this year but nothing since.  I would feel pain/cramps on either side of my abdomen during what I thought was ovulation every month.  The first few months were abnormally painful.  And I would get cramps two weeks later - I always felt like a period was coming but it never did.  I finally went to my doctor in early April.  He did blood work which he said was normal and did an ultrasound, which showed a dominant follicle.  He told me to wait and see.  I went back in late June for a follow-up.  This was the first time my hormone levels were tested. 

Results: FSH - 55.  Estriadol - 148.  Progesterone - 0.3. Testosterone- 0.76.  LH - 46.5.

My family doctor had no idea what any of this meant and sent me to a specialist clinic.

I saw the OB/specialist in early August.  For some reason my hormone test results never made it to my file.  I told her that my FSH was 55.  She told me then - without taking a second test, without doing a day 3 test, without even seeing the results - that I had POF and that I should go to a fertility doctor and look into donor eggs.  This was my first fucking appointment and I had no idea what was going on and this is what was put on me in the first 30 minutes.  She wrote me a prescription for HRT and that was it.  They took further blood tests, but she told me not to expect anything to change.  

I haven’t started the HRT because I’m not ready and partially because the first specialist told me that the estrogen would swell me up and I have a wedding to go to and I want to look good in my dress.  If my life is shit I at least want to look pretty.

I booked an appointment with a naturopath after this.  She recommended a whole lot of vitamins and some TCM herbs, which I have been taking since mid-August. 

I went back to the OB last week and half of my test results from the early August appointment had gone missing so they had to redo them.  So I had blood work done last Monday.

I got a call from the OB on Thursday saying that the results were in and that my FSH was 7.9 and that my estrogen was ok.  I was shocked, but happy.  And then on Friday my period came back!  It felt so good.  I felt like a woman again.  She also mentioned that my thyroid levels were off and that they wanted me to see an Endocrinologist.

They called me back in to the OB today.  I mentioned to the intake person/resident that I had seen the naturopath and had I had been taking the TCM herbs.  The resident, my OB and an Endo then came into the room and basically lectured me about going to a naturopath and taking herbs, told me that my period is fake and that the herbs might give me cancer and that they skewed the last blood results.  I felt like I was a kid being lectured for doing something wrong.  They want me to stop the herbs and come back again in a few weeks for a re-test.  They said that my estrogen was at an unhealthy high level.

I hate all of this. I hate being on an emotional roller coaster. I hate the way all of this makes me feel.  I wasn’t ready to have kids before now.  I finally found someone who I want to do this with and I’m being told that it can’t happen and I don’t understand.  Why do I still get cramps every month but no period?  No one will explain that.  Why did I get “ovulation” cramps every month if I wasn’t ovulating?  I don’t like my doctors.  But they are supposed to be the best in the city and the only place that specializes in POF.  I feel like they don’t listen.  They don’t explain.  The herbs are the only thing that has changed anything for me.

I don’t have anyone around who understands.  My partner thinks that the specialists are just brushing off eastern medicine. He just thinks that everything will work itself out.  My best friend has a toddler and I can barely talk to her because I’m so jealous.  I just need some help.  

Sorry if none of this makes any sense or if it’s too long or I’m too sad.

I'm 35, as is my husband. I stopped taking the pill in May of 2015, but we didn't start officially ""trying"" until August. After two years of no luck, I had my first appointment with an RE last week. It was pretty standard, and I have to call the first day of my next period to schedule an HSG and second sperm analysis for my husband. (He had one in August of 2016, but the RE said a lot can change in a year and wants to repeat it). He had very good results on the first analysis.

However--my lab results are slowly trickling in (they report them electronically if you opt in) and my AMH was only .23!!!

I was given two options in November for a FET by my RE - either Nov 3 or Nov 10 and if I can't make either of these dates it will be pushed out to January due to scheduling issues in December.  The issue is my clinic says they strongly recommend rest for the day of transfer and two days after and both Nov 3 and Nov 10 aren't great days. On Nov 3 I go to classes in the evening and all day on Nov 4. I reached out and unfortunately my professor stated that she will fail me if I miss out both days for any reason (I have reached out to the program manager to see if this is even within school policy). Nov 10 is the Friday before a big deliverable at work and depending on what's going on I might even have to work that weekend. My boss is very old school so there is no telecommuting option. So I'm debating just doing a Nov 3 transfer and going to school that night (and skipping the Nov 4 class day since it's all day from 8 am  to 6 pm - I know I am allowed to miss 1 class within school policy). I googled (yes I know not best) and it seems really varied on how much rest everyone had after their FET. I don't want to mess up my chances but I'm not sure if the clinic is just overly conservative? I asked again with more details and the nurse just repeated the same thing she said in the beginning which is that they strongly recommend day off on the transfer day and two extra days if I want to be successful.

tl;dr How many days of rest after the FET did others do?

So my husband and I have hit our ""deadline"" to conceive somewhat naturally. I am currently on his insurance which has no IF coverage aside from diagnostic tests and three medicated cycles. I am a nurse that is employed at a major healthcare system that also has the only fertility clinic in our city, the one we've been going to. My employer offers a plan that has $4500 IVF + ICSI and next month is open enrollment, so in order to consider the IVF route, I need to decide now if I want to switch insurance (hence, the deadline). Even so, this would be the only fertility clinic covered under the $4500. 

Thing is, I can't stand our RE there. I am just a number to her, and she really doesn't seem to give a shit about getting us pregnant. 

-She never drew a FSH/LH saying it was ""old science"" and said only the AMH matters. 

-During my Femara cycles, I had to keep reminding her to up the dosage (even after the first cycle when they made me come back FIVE TIMES to be twat wanded for follicle scans because I was NOT RESPONDING). She literally would never change the dose until each time I had to call and ask her nurse to ask her to change it since I had not responded well the previous cycle. 

-She said my husband's 18 mil count with 17% motility and 2% morph was normal and she was not concerned (what?). I had to ask her, six months later, if we could try a repeat SA, and she was reluctant to have it done but let us do it. When that one was even worse than the first, I never heard back from her. I finally got in touch with her via email and asked if we should be referred to a reproductive urologist, and her literal response was ""that's up to you. If you want to. We have one at the clinic."" I feel I shouldn't have to keep pestering my RE to keep us moving forward. 

-She has discouraged even trying IUI saying they don't really work, even in conjunction with the Femara. Excuse me but, if there is any way to get my husband's abysmal sperm closer to the goalie, why can't we try this? 

Anyway, I'm just not vibing well with her, and if we are even going to consider IVF, I definitely don't want her running the show. Has anyone had to switch RE's, within the same clinic? I feel pretty embarrassed just calling to ask. Do I start all over?

My RE personally doesn't perform HSG's, so when I went in for mine last year (which I had to BEG for btw, because of course, she doesn't think they are useful), another RE performed it and he was such a kind, awesome doctor. I'm hoping to call and ask to switch to being his patient, if he is accepting more.

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m just not vibing well with her, and if we are even going to consider IVF, I definitely don&#39;t want her running the show. Has anyone had to switch RE&#39;s, within the same clinic? I feel pretty embarrassed just calling to ask. Do I start all over?</p>

<p>My RE personally doesn&#39;t perform HSG&#39;s, so when I went in for mine last year (which I had to BEG for btw, because of course, she doesn&#39;t think they are useful), another RE performed it and he was such a kind, awesome doctor. I&#39;m hoping to call and ask to switch to being his patient, if he is accepting more. </p>

Kitaya K1, Matsubayashi H1, Takaya Y1, Nishiyama R1, Yamaguchi K1, Takeuchi T1, Ishikawa T1.

Abstract
PROBLEM: The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the prevalence of chronic endometritis (CE) in infertile women with a history of repeated implantation failure (RIF) and to determine whether oral antibiotic treatment improves their live birth rate in the following embryo transfer (ET) cycles.

METHOD OF STUDY: Endometrial biopsy samples obtained from infertile women with RIF were subjected to immunohistochemistrical/histopathologic diagnosis of CE. Following antibiotic administration to the RIF/CE group, their histopathologic cure rate, microbial detection rate, and reproductive outcome in the subsequent ET cycles were prospectively studied.

RESULTS: 33.7% of infertile women with RIF were diagnosed with CE. Following the first-line doxycycline treatment, the histopathologic cure rate in the subsequent endometrial biopsy was 92.3%. Following the second-line metronidazole/ciprofloxacin treatment, the overall cure rate was 99.1%. The live birth rate in the first ET cycle (P=.031, RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.03-2.12) and cumulative three ET cycles (P=.037, RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02-1.90) following antibiotic treatment in the cured RIF/CE group (32.8% and 38.8%, respectively) was significantly higher than in the RIF/non-CE group (22.1% and 27.9%, respectively).

CONCLUSION: Chronic endometritis was found in one-third of infertile women with RIF.

ER was yesterday, woke up feeling good this morning and it's been downhill all day. Feel crampy and sloshy and definitely more swollen than I was the last days of stims. I get out of breath really easily and can't comfortably stand up straight and I'm nauseous. Also constipated for the first time in my life - have only pooped once since my trigger on Thursday, despite being on my third day of stool softeners.

I don't think I'm at risk of OHSS - had 15 follicles, E2 around 3800 the day before trigger (they didn't test it after that), and Lupron trigger. But I feel like shit and getting worse.

Is this normal? I have done a lot more walking than is probably ideal - so much is closed around here now that I've probably walked 1-2 miles each the last two days just getting food. I fly home tomorrow and that will be GREAT, except for the hours in transit, which I expect will be pretty miserable.

Anyway, hoping for advice as to whether this is normal or whether I should be concerned.

Thanks all!

54,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi ladies - I have had 2 failed FETs over the past year on PGS tested 5 day blasts. For my next transfer, my doc and I have agreed to do 2 months of Depot lupron to suppress suspected endo and reset lining issues. He wasn't super convinced that endo was my definitive cause for the past two failures, but he was willing to try something new for the next round. 

My question is for those of you that have done the Depot Lupron for FET, can you share your protocol? Did you do BCP before your first Depot shot and did you continue to take BCP for the first week after your Depot shot? From what 
I read online, it seems that DL shots are typically given on CD1-3, so shouldn't I stop my BCP before I go in for my first Depot shot? 

This isn't a protocol my clinic / nurses typically do for patients, so my nurses didn't have answers when I asked them why I'm supposed to be on BCP after my first shot of Depot Lupron. Any insight or ideas greatly appreciated! 

My protocol goes like this: 
-- 28 days of active BCP
-- Depot lupron shot #1 after 24 days of BCP (note I will take another 4 days of BCP after the lupron shot)

For my next transfer, my doc and I have agreed to do 2 months of Depot lupron to suppress suspected endo and reset lining issues. He wasn&#39;t super convinced that endo was my definitive cause for the past two failures, but he was willing to try something new for the next round. </p>

<p>My question is for those of you that have done the Depot Lupron for FET, can you share your protocol? Did you do BCP before your first Depot shot and did you continue to take BCP for the first week after your Depot shot? From what 
I read online, it seems that DL shots are typically given on CD1-3, so shouldn&#39;t I stop my BCP before I go in for my first Depot shot? </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a protocol my clinic / nurses typically do for patients, so my nurses didn&#39;t have answers when I asked them why I&#39;m supposed to be on BCP after my first shot of Depot Lupron. Any insight or ideas greatly appreciated! </p>

<p>My protocol goes like this: 
-- 28 days of active BCP
-- Depot lupron shot #1 after 24 days of BCP (note I will take another 4 days of BCP after the lupron shot) 
-- 4 weeks after my first shot, do second shot of Depot Lupron
-- Approx 26 after second shot of DL, start BCP again for 21 days
-- Then start lupron suppression, vivelle patches, etc - standard medicated FET prep </p>

I have been lurking after a particularly gutting natural cycle in which I was 11 days late.  The day I started spotting and knew I would get my period, I was blindsided in front of a group of people by finding out that my best friend's girlfriend is pregnant.  It seems like now is the time to engage with this group since it is waaaay better than any other IF forum I have seen around the internet.  You guys are awesome and I am looking forward to being a part of a group that really gets it.  

My husband and I have been trying for about 5 years.  For most of that time he was in school and we did not have very good insurance coverage.  After a year or so of trying on our own, at 34 years old I met with my first RE.  We did a monitered cycle and SA and everything looked pretty good except I had an endometrioma, which meant I have endometriosis.  I had an HSG and he found one tube blocked, which he was able to force open.  Starting late that night I had level 10 pain, but calls to the RE were not taken seriously since I did not have a fever.  Pain remained but RE just did not want to deal with it.  At our final meeting to discuss test results and overall plan he told us to do IVF of course, and gave us an 80% chance - whatever the fuck that means.
I was told that I could have surgery to remove endo and cyst but I was ""on the cusp of being too old"" so he did not want to do it.  Just do IVF and everything will be fine.  We were paying out of pocket and not making much money at the time so there was just no way.

We were totally devestated at hearing that our only hope was IVF even though we were both pretty damn healthy endo aside.  I sank into a pretty bad depression for a year until it was time for my annual exam.  I had been dealing with intermittant pain the whole time but was too depressed to deal with it.  When I went in the GYN could not find my cervix right away because that the endometrioma was by now so large that it was pushing my organs around.  Apparently that HSG ""woke up all my cysts"" as the GYN said, and at 8cm or so it needed to go.  I had surgery to remove the cyst and endo and all went well.  Hope returned.  

Now it has been over two years since the surgery and still no dice.  Hubs has a new job and great insurance so we found a new RE and had two failed IUI's.  That was earlier this year.  I had finally gained some ground with IF related depression.  Life changes made me forget a little I guess.  But now I am sinking back down to the depths and trying to find the will to do some more IUI's.  

Getting back to that pregnant friend and the advice.  I had told this friend to please email me or send me a card or something when they got pregnant.  Thought I had my bases covered.  To be fair they have not had a perfectly easy time of it.  I know that because we have talked about it.  She needed some medical intervention and once they got her sorted she got some positive tests and early miscarriages (at least one, but maybe 2).  I think partly he didn't tell be because he was afraid she was just going to lose it again, but now plenty of time has passed.  This is happening.  I don't think I can talk to him on the phone about this.  I will totally fall apart.  My plan is to email him, but I am having trouble figuring out what to say.  I honestly don't know if he is scared to talk to me about it or somehow oblivious that I am upset.  I feel like all my email drafts so far sound way too accusatory and I'm worried that I'm taking out my IF on him.  I am also terrified that they could lose this pregnancy and then I am a super asshole for being upset about this.  

I know this is a long post right out of the gate, and I appreciate any advice I can get from people that understand.

Update:  I got myself so worked up about this, I had to do something.  I sent him an email saying that I was upset over how it went down, and even though I am happy for him, I feel hurt that he hasn't mentioned it to me. This is the first real confrontation I have had about my IF.  Every other time I just ate it.  We'll see how it goes. 

**New Update** I did hear back from him and he says he is really sorry.  He remembers talking to me about sending a message but I guess didn't put it together at the time.  Ok, so now that's done.

<p>Getting back to that pregnant friend and the advice.  I had told this friend to please email me or send me a card or something when they got pregnant.  Thought I had my bases covered.  To be fair they have not had a perfectly easy time of it.  I know that because we have talked about it.  She needed some medical intervention and once they got her sorted she got some positive tests and early miscarriages (at least one, but maybe 2).  I think partly he didn&#39;t tell be because he was afraid she was just going to lose it again, but now plenty of time has passed.  This is happening.  I don&#39;t think I can talk to him on the phone about this.  I will totally fall apart.  My plan is to email him, but I am having trouble figuring out what to say.  I honestly don&#39;t know if he is scared to talk to me about it or somehow oblivious that I am upset.  I feel like all my email drafts so far sound way too accusatory and I&#39;m worried that I&#39;m taking out my IF on him.  I am also terrified that they could lose this pregnancy and then I am a super asshole for being upset about this.  </p>

<p>I know this is a long post right out of the gate, and I appreciate any advice I can get from people that understand.</p>

<p>Update:  I got myself so worked up about this, I had to do something.  I sent him an email saying that I was upset over how it went down, and even though I am happy for him, I feel hurt that he hasn&#39;t mentioned it to me. This is the first real confrontation I have had about my IF.  Every other time I just ate it.  We&#39;ll see how it goes. </p>

<p><strong>New Update</strong> I did hear back from him and he says he is really sorry.  He remembers talking to me about sending a message but I guess didn&#39;t put it together at the time.  Ok, so now that&#39;s done.  Fuck I&#39;m crying again.  At least I didn&#39;t love a friend over this, so that&#39;s a win.</p>

So Aunt Becky decides all Stephanie needs is a second opinion on this whole ""Can't have a baby thing"" and surprise surprise, she has 'a few viable eggs left,' but must get started right away, and will need a surrogate

They are actually relatively accurate in the cost of that, but of course, the whole family decides to ""pitch in"" and will totally help utterly broke Steph with the cost...which, whatever, they live in a 2.5 mil house in San Francisco,  I'm sure someone has that kind of scratch lying around.

So then, Stephanie decides she needs to keep this from her boyfriend, and will be using a sperm donor for some reason, I dunno, it was weird.  Anyway, heartfelt midair ""I will love you AND this baby Steph"" moment, boyfriend WILL be the baby daddy, and scene.

This community has provided me with comfort though, knowing there are others that can completely relate to me.  I am not ""out"" to most people in my personal life, and the few that I am out to are extremely supportive, but have not had the same experiences.  

My husband and I have been trying to conceive officially for 4 years, but have not used any sort of birth control for 5.  I have a history of cancer and became involved in a longitudinal research study about 9 years ago comparing (theoretical) fertility of women with a cancer history vs. those without it.  So I've been having follicles measured and AMH, FSH, etc. tested for a long time.  Everything has always been fine.  I've also had normal periods since age 11, even during chemotherapy.  The doctor who conducted the study is also my RE, so I've been seeing her for a long time and she knows me well.  
I had an HSG in 2014 which showed a cyst blocking one of my tubes (other one was fine).  So I had surgery to remove that.  There were still no positive pregnancy tests, my husband got tested and had good motility, but slightly low sperm count.  We tried for a while after that with clomid, and then went to IUI in 2016.  We did three IUIs which all failed.  
In December 2016 we decided to move onto IVF (I was very resistant to this, as I know someone IRL who did years of retrievals/transfers and was a basket case of course).  Stimulation went really well, I produced 19 eggs, 18 fertilized with ICSI and we ended up with 11 5 day blasts.  Literally in the recovery room after retrieval we got a call from my MIL (who only knows we haven't been able to conceive, but no details) who fell and broke both arms and had to come stay with us for several weeks. Because of course.  Our cat also got very sick and needed surgery around the same time because life is crazy.  We did a fresh transfer which resulted in a positive beta, but was low.  It dropped after two days.  We then did a FET in April which resulted in a good positive beta, but betas did not rise as they should have, and they could not find anything on the ultrasound at 6 weeks.  I was scheduled for a D&E but started bleeding the day of the procedure.  In August we decided to transfer 2 hoping that one would take.  I got a good positive beta that was increasing as it should.  1 embryo implanted and I had a missed miscarriage at 8 weeks 5 days.  I had a D&E Wednesday, and now I'm just so sad. 
I'm feeling my age, regretting not going immediately to IVF, not getting embryos tested, etc.

Married for 5 years and had decided to start trying -- we kind of knew that there might be issues because my husband does not produce any semen when he ejaculates... like maybe one drop. We knew it would probably be an issue but we kind of decided to ignore the problem until we were ready. When we decided it was time I started doing my research and realized that it was actually going to be an issue to only have 1 drop of semen. I asked him to make an appointment with his primary care physician to get referred to a urologist. Urologist told us he couldn't do anything and that we should probably contact an infertility specialist. 

Here's where things get interesting....all of these doctors appointments and tests ect take SO LONG. I'm getting my Ph.D. in molecular biology so we decided to do some ""experiments"" in the meantime. Retrograde is when the semen goes back into the bladder instead of coming out like it's supposed to...I suspected that this was my husband's problem since he had cancer as a baby with abdominal surgery which often causes nerve damage leading to retrograde. So we went to my lab, had him ejaculate in the bathroom and then I had him pee into a cup and we looked at it under a microscope. ANDDD...there were sperm!! We did a happy dance. The sperm were in the urine, and dead :( but they were there! 

Since then, I've bought a microscope, centrifuge, pH test strips, salinity meter etc. My hope is that I can figure out how to keep the most sperm alive in the urine so that we can use them for artificial insemination, IUI or IVF. I've been working on a protocol to keep them alive and I have gotten to the point where I can see 1-2 moving/living sperm still alive even after being in the urine. 

In January, I am able to get added to my husband's insurance which covers some infertility treatment but until then I'm just optimizing this protocol, doing some artificial inseminations with the sperm I've extracted from the urine and doing testing go get ready to start fertility treatments (HSG and official SA in a few weeks). 

We haven't told anyone else what is going on yet and I'm already struggling emotionally with feeling like things are unfair and being annoyed that we are literally SO CLOSE. The sperm are there and there are lots of them but they just instantly die in the vat of toxic acid in my husband's bladder. 

I know we have a lot to be thankful for and it is still early so I'm optimistic but I'm already feeling like cutting ties with some friends who are expecting and are totally driving me nut and insensitive because I haven't told them that it's going to be a struggle for us.

94,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So I just completed my third round of IVF. Everything was going so great. I started injections on Saturday Sept. 2nd, and when I had my first in office appt on Tuesday the 5th, my estradiol was already around 450ish so they had me lower my menopur from 450 to 375. I also was taking 8 units of HGH but they had me continue on that same dose. Well I ended up only stimming for 8 days because my follicles were growing nicely and I had about 11-12 follicles ranging in size from 17-21mm when I triggered. I ended up getting 13 eggs retrieved, 9 were mature and 6 fertilized. When the lab called me on day 3 they told me I had 3 really good  embryos and 3 fair ones. 

Now this is where my rant comes in. My doc called me personally to let me know the results and told me that if we wanted to do a 3 day transfer we could. I told him I was inclined to do a 3DT because the first round we did a 5DT that was not successful, the second round we did a 3DT and we were pregnant until about week 10 when we miscarried. So I told him that I really felt like a 3DT was best but that I would call my husband and my GC and see what they thought. 

My husband said he also talked with the doctor and said since we have 2 8-cell and 1 10-cell on day 3, he thinks that we should for sure wait until a Sunday 5 day  transfer. I again expressed to my husband how hesitant I was to wait until Sunday, but my husband kept saying the doctor told him there is no difference in waiting to do a 5DT.

Then I called my GC and she said she would do whatever I wanted to do, but she would prefer a 5DT also because of family commitments. My GC reiterated to me that she would do whatever I wanted. Even though I know my husband and GC would have done what I wanted to, I guess I was trying to please everyone, I don't know, and agreed to do a 5DT last Sunday.

As we were getting ready to leave our house Sunday morning, my doctor calls me again to tell me that he had bad news, and that all 6 of our embryos had stopped growing and we had nothing to transfer this round. 

I about lost my mind. Firstly, I was furious at myself for not insisting that we do a 3DT. I know the studies show that if it makes it to day 5, there are better chances of resulting in a successful pregnancy, but how does anyone know that it wouldn't have survived if we had transferred day 3? I mean even if it hadn't, at least we would have had SOME KIND of chance this round. Now I just feel like that was a complete waste of time, money and everything because we didn't even get to try and transfer anything. Ugh if only I would have told them that I want to do a 3DT.

I'm devastated. I can't even talk with my sisters about this yet because I know I will completely lose it. Now we are going back and forth wondering if we're done, do we try one more time and insist on day 3..I just don't know anything right now. I've been absolutely beating myself up every day for not insisting on a 3DT. Like I'm sick about it. 

To make matters worse, of course this weekend on FB I see two pregnancy announcements from TEENAGERS! I officially lost it after seeing those. I mean I was crying and bawling and yelling uncontrollably. It wasn't my best night. 

Anyway, I have been wanting to post this here to at least get it off  my chest, but its taken me a few days to be able to do so.

I got back my 23andme results today, indicating I have a compound heterozygous MTHFR mutation. I am still waiting on other clotting disorder results from my RPL panel, but my doctor didn't order homocysteine or Factor II. I called the office and asked if I could add those and also asked if they had the rest of my tests in. The nurse emailed me the lab slip and said, yes we have most of the tests results in but will go over them with you at your consult. My consult is not until 10/9. I was stunned, as it was my impression they would call when they got the results and I said as much. I tried to explain that I am fully aware of all the tests I got and what the ramifications are. I also explained that getting information is the last thing I have that gives me any comfort, whether its good or bad news, and withholding information for 3 weeks was very upsetting to me. I also said I would happily pick up my records and wait to discuss an action plan with my doctor, but at least I would know my results in the meantime. I get a phone call from the Office Manager, letting me know that they will not give me results ""like this"" over the phone and that I should stop harassing the nurse for test results. Again, I tried to explain and I am very, very upset by this whole process and that having information of any kind is a comfort, that I desperately need. She then proceeded to tell me my records will be ready tomorrow and hung up.

I just turned 36yo, was diagnosed with Diminish ovarian reserve last year. AMH 0.55.  After many unsuccessful attempts at getting pregnant via ovulation induction, we decided to try IVF in Jan 2017.  Fast forward 9 months and we have now done 3 IVF cycles, though I wouldn't call them truly IVF because we still haven't attempted an embryo transfer.  We wanted to bank as many embryos as we could before I got pregnant with the1st baby, so we could have a 2nd baby down the road (figuring my ovaries would be really done in 2 years).  Out of the 3 cycles I produced a total of 17 (7/6/5) embryos, but only 5 that lived to day 5 and only 1 that was normal with PGS testing.  We call that our popsicle baby because it's in frozen storage.  After $35,000 I am ready to come to terms that my eggs are just old, few, and lousy.  My husband thinks it's worth 1 more try with a different clinic. My sister is 28 (never pregnant) and has offered to go through a cycle and donate her eggs to us.  I feel bad putting her through all the injections and hormones and weight gain; Especially since she lives hours away and I wouldn't be there with her.  So I came up with the brilliant idea that my sister and I would travel to this big fancy clinic in California together HRC (www.makingbabies.com) and cycle together.   I would go through one last IVF cycle to see if we could squeeze those ovaries for a few more drops and my sister would do an egg harvesting cycle.  We would fertilize all my eggs and enough of her eggs (25% success rate = 20 eggs?) to give us a chance of 4 good embryos.  If she makes lots of eggs we would freeze the rest and save them for her if she ever needs them.  

So...
The venting: As *simple* as it sounds in my brain, this is fucking complicated.  In addition to all the labs and exams my sister now needs, there are psych evals, lawyers, double infectious disease tests, repeat genetic screening now for her, cycles to sync, finding a place to stay and a car for a month, plane tickets, leave from work.  Plus I have yet to meet an infertility office staff that has their shit together, so it's more like I'm coordinating them, than they me! These seems like an insurmountable mountain, not to mention that I'm hemorrhaging money.  Ahhh!
 
- Does anyone have experience with HRC, Dr. Coffler?  Are they as great as they advertise (and their stats show)?
- Has anyone done a known donor?  How much is the legal stuff?
- Any success stories with DOR?  
- Should I use DHEA? CoQ10? Acupuncture? Zoloft and booze?
- Is my math right? 2 babies =  60% implantation rate for PGS normal embryo x 4 embryos = 25% normal embryo rate for a egg donor x  20 eggs
- Did you use an egg donor?  How many eggs did they make?  How many good embryos?

We call that our popsicle baby because it&#39;s in frozen storage.  After $35,000 I am ready to come to terms that my eggs are just old, few, and lousy.  My husband thinks it&#39;s worth 1 more try with a different clinic. My sister is 28 (never pregnant) and has offered to go through a cycle and donate her eggs to us.  I feel bad putting her through all the injections and hormones and weight gain; Especially since she lives hours away and I wouldn&#39;t be there with her.  So I came up with the brilliant idea that my sister and I would travel to this big fancy clinic in California together HRC (<a href=""http://www.makingbabies.com"">www.makingbabies.com</a>) and cycle together.   I would go through one last IVF cycle to see if we could squeeze those ovaries for a few more drops and my sister would do an egg harvesting cycle.  We would fertilize all my eggs and enough of her eggs (25% success rate = 20 eggs?) to give us a chance of 4 good embryos.  If she makes lots of eggs we would freeze the rest and save them for her if she ever needs them.  </p>

<p>So...
The venting: As <em>simple</em> as it sounds in my brain, this is fucking complicated.  In addition to all the labs and exams my sister now needs, there are psych evals, lawyers, double infectious disease tests, repeat genetic screening now for her, cycles to sync, finding a place to stay and a car for a month, plane tickets, leave from work.  Plus I have yet to meet an infertility office staff that has their shit together, so it&#39;s more like I&#39;m coordinating them, than they me! These seems like an insurmountable mountain, not to mention that I&#39;m hemorrhaging money.  Ahhh!</p>

<ul>
<li>Does anyone have experience with HRC, Dr. Coffler?  Are they as great as they advertise (and their stats show)?</li>
<li>Has anyone done a known donor?  How much is the legal stuff?</li>
<li>Any success stories with DOR?<br/></li>
<li>Should I use DHEA? CoQ10? Acupuncture? Zoloft and booze?</li>
<li>Is my math right? 2 babies =  60% implantation rate for PGS normal embryo x 4 embryos = 25% normal embryo rate for a egg donor x  20 eggs</li>
<li>Did you use an egg donor?  How many eggs did they make?  How many good embryos? </li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you!  Best of luck with your own journeys too!</p>

So she says my chances of success with IUI (or more IVF should we try again, which we are not planning if we can avoid it), are low, like maybe under 5%?

We had our initial fresh transfer (2 embryos) five days after my egg retrieval. We have three frozen embryos left, but I just had two frozen cycles cancelled back to back before we ever even got to the transfer. The first FET I was on oral BCPs and estrogen. All was textbook until my last monitoring appt before the transfer when I find out I had a breakthrough ovulation, which, according to the Dr, only happens about 1-2% of the time. Oh goodie. I'm a goddamn unicorn. Cycle cancelled. A couple thousand dollars later, we go at it again, this time with lupron and del estrogen injections. I didn't ovulate, but my lining also didn't develop. Cycle cancelled.

My Dr reviewed all three cycles again in more detail, and paid extra attention to my fresh cycle since it resulted in a full term singleton birth (I only mention it because it is relevant to my medical history and fertility journey). From what she can tell, my body does NOT like the del estrogen injections BUT is fine with the lupron. She has come up with a very particular, detailed protocol for the next time around that is a little closer to that fresh protocol, and she wanted to give me mediation to force a period so we could try again right away. I asked if I had to, or if we could just wait until my body cycles naturally to start again. I figured I could use a little break both physically and psychologically. She thought that was a great idea and encouraged it, so right now I am ""on a break"" for at least one month, maybe two, depending on my husband's travel for work.

My fresh IVF transfer went so well, I kinda feel like I had this roller coaster coming (not in a self loathing kind of way, just a Murphy's Law kind of way). I am just curious who else has had similar issues with their FET cycles and what has/has not worked for you.

The article is mainly focused on older women who get zero PGS normal embryos, and whether they should be able to transfer abnormal embryos. I can definitely see why that might be the right choice for some women, especially if they end up with nothing ""normal"" to transfer.

But I don't love the sensationalism of ""there are so many babies who could have been born!!!"" and how the story completely ignores why some couples chose PGS (especially those with repeated losses) and the horrible pain of miscarriage/TFMR. I also don't totally believe that none of the women who transferred abnormal embryos as part of this little experiment didn't have to TFMR (I guess it's a small sample size). I think what this article doesn't address is that surely, if people start transferring abnormal embryos, TFMRs are going to happen. But women in a large parts of the U.S. don't have access to abortion services. Do they just have to hope that things will self-correct?! That's fucked. 

This was interesting takeaway though: “The American Society for Reproductive Medicine is poised to issue a guideline to physicians, according to a version of the document obtained by New York, stating that there is “insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of” PGS “in all infertile patients.”” Seems pretty common sense to me, but I also was at a clinic where PGS was not pushed.

I'm curious what you guys think about it (and whether anyone has read the medical studies behind these findings). I did not do PGS and miscarried what was almost surely a genetically abnormal embryo this past summer, so I'm definitely considering doing PGS if we reach the point of another retrieval (we've got one fair day-five blast and one morula that we'll probably transfer together this coming summer, when we have the time and money to do it). 

I also loled at the author thinking B*FN means ""Big Fat Nothing"", bahahaha. What a jabroni.

Background: male and female couple with unexplained infertility, no known health issues.

We are six weeks out from a fresh transfer of a single hatching blastocyst from our first round of IVF that resulted in a negative pregnancy test. We haven't heard from the clinic since the call to confirm the negative test, so we called to book the followup. Our file hasn't been reviewed yet and because of that, they won't book the followup.

It seems a bit odd that the appointment can't even be booked and we live many hours from the clinic so it would be nice to plan... Is this normal practice?

The cycle itself seemed a bit odd as well. The initial FSH dose was basically the same as 2 negative IUI+med cycles that resulted in single follicles to be ready on trigger day (we had asked the nurses that we try for multiple follicles on the second IUI but that didn't seem to be acted on). On day 5 of the IVF cycle, the FSH dose was nearly tripled and we were worried about a cancelled cycle. It seems like our history wasn't considered when setting the initial dose?

After a stim cycle that took a couple of more days than expected, we had what seemed to be a great retrieval and good fertilization and development. On the day before the day 5 transfer, we had 5 high quality morulas and we were told by the embryologist to expect to freeze several blastocysts.

Yayyy!! After years of trying and so many questions, it seemed like things were going well. 

Minutes before the transfer on day 5, we were told that 4 of the morulas had arrested but the remaining blastocyst was good for transfer. Reading various forums... this doesn't seem typical but also isn't unheard of. We asked if they could be monitored for another day and did learn during that time that they hadn't really ""arrested"" but they believed the embryo quality wasn't viable so none were frozen. Had we known this, we may have asked for more than one to be transferred on day 5.

Based on the weirdness booking the WTF and all of our questions, combined with the lack of followup (we haven't talked to a doctor since a few months before the first IUI) and an extra 3 month delay (6 months total) between our initial consult and testing results because of a filing error... we are losing trust in the clinic. Is this warranted or are we expecting too much?

Story: About 2 years I did an egg donation, the process took about 4 months of lab testing and doing paperwork. The week before the donation I had to inject 2-3 different fertility drugs into my stomach each night. I ended up releasing 22 eggs into my ovaries. After the retrieval of the eggs, I was told by the nurse practitioner that they were ""bad"". She described them as grainy and oval. When I asked what that meant, she just told me to see a fertility doctor.

Questions: Can anyone shed light on what this may indicate? Or have experienced the same problem?

I am not sure if I am in the right place, but I am wondering if there is anyone out there with the 46,XX SRY+ Male karyotype.  It's a very rare form of Klinfelters where the Y is not present, just the SRY (sex-determining region Y protein) that has transcribed on to one of the X chromosome.  This makes for someone to have completely male features, but is technically a chromosomal ""female"", if you disregard the SRY leg. (Good diagram here: https://amasianv.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/xx-male1.jpg)

We saw a genetic counselor and ""specialist"" yesterday and they both explained the very minimum and gave very vague answers to our questions.  The specialist drew a diagram with X and Y's and confirmed that XX Males are indeed, very rare. (All of this we already knew)  We left feeling very discouraged and felt as if the appointment that we waited 6 weeks for was a waste of time.  At one point, the genetic counselor encouraged us to try to conceive naturally for a while to see if it ""just happens"" which, honestly, felt like a slap in the face since most XX Males are sterile.

Anyway, our next step is a semen analysis to see if he has azoospermia.  We aren't very sure what to expect other than it to come back as a zero count, at least confirming our fears and having it on his chart so another ""medical professional"" doesn't tell us to try naturally.

Is there anyone out there who is going through something similar or that can point me in the direction of some articles or a specialist who actually knows what they are talking about?   We were told early on in this journey that we may be contacted to participate in a study since this form of Klinefelters is very rare, especially with someone who is relatively a-symptomatic and has normal testosterone levels.

  Is there any hope for us to have children of our own?  Any advice or encouraging thoughts are gladly accepted.  Thank you!

Lucky him, this is a new mutation, as his father does not have it and it's passed down on the Y chromosome. 

There is a chance that the Dr will find sperm when doing a MicroTESE as the strain he has (AZFc) gives a 40-50% chance of finding any. I hoped for better odds. Typically in this scenario if they do find sperm, it's not a lot and it's still immature so they don't recommend freezing it because the risk of losing some due to freezing and then thawing is too high. If they were to find a significant amount, then they will freeze some. They recommend that I have my egg retrieval right around the same time as this surgery so they can do ICSI if sperm is found. 

They also said that many patients have donor sperm as a back up ready to go in the event that no sperm is found. To be completely honest, donor sperm was originally a hard no for us. But hearing that it's possibly the only way we can have a child that's even partially biologically ours has changed that some but we're still thinking. I'll have eggs retrieved and then if they don't find any sperm, we need a plan for the eggs. We could just freeze them, but then what's our plan? An IUI with a donor was a thought, but if I already have the eggs retrieved then would it really make sense to do an IUI instead? 

I haven't done any testing for IVF yet. Literally none. Since we were waiting to figure out what was going on with hubs, the Dr. recommended holding off on me. We have an appointment on Friday with the RE to recap the Urologist visit and make a plan. We will ask his opinion on donor back up sperm and what he thinks, where he recommends getting it from, the selection process, etc.... I assume then I'll plan to do CD3 blood work for hormones but my question is, what else should I expect before I can start IVF? I'll be on CD15 on Friday. Do you think I'll have to do a HSG since we'll be planning for IVF? I'm such a chicken about all of this so any potentially painful test I can avoid I will be happy with! I plan to ask the Dr, of course.

I'm glad that the Urologist said surgery is an option for hubs but was also hopeful that they could freeze it before me starting IVF. It's okay that that's not the case, I just hate that we'll have to go through everything while not even knowing if they'll find anything. I am also super thankful for our doctors. We're so new to this process but so far they've made great recommendations and not had us running around trying to get answers. They've been very proactive and seem to have our best interests in mind.

I've also started looking into counseling for infertility. Hubs says he's okay with using a donor if we need but I don't think it would hurt to have someone else talk through everything with us to make sure we're both okay with it.

First an intro: I'm 35, trying for number one for 21 months.  My partner and I have been together for six years but we delayed our trying until we both finished grad school. We actually became pregnant on our first month trying but had an early miscarriage which completely, absolutely devastated me.  It was like someone cut off an arm. It gutted me, to where I was crying on the bus at seeing other pregnant women, crying at pregnancy announcements, crying with every period.  (The stuff that I think seems normal now for anyone else going through infertility, unfortunately).  One year later, we were referred for infertility investigations and found my AMH was 9, I had a blocked right tube and partner has a low (14k) but otherwise normal semen analysis.  We were put forward for IVF and while waiting, became pregnant again, but this time with an ectopic.  Because of how it was positioned, it was possible that they would have to remove a corner of my uterus, or do a complete hysterectomy.  Thankfully, they were able to leave the uterus alone and remove just one tube. So I suppose I was less sad about this pregnancy as a) I kept my uterus intact and we were given the green light to keep going (if they removed part of my uterus, we would have had to wait 12+ months and the chance of carrying a pregnancy to term would be extremely low); and b) despite being in the wrong place, it seemed to be growing normally, which was reassuring.  That said, the idea that I might lose my womb and would lose my tube made me think long and hard about the very real possibility that I would never have a genetically-related child.  And as painful as that was, I started to at least acknowledge it as a possibility.  Not embrace it or accept it, but notice its presence in the corner and poke it with a stick once in a while and realize that, while it’s painful, it won't kill me.  It will change the shape and texture of my life and my plans and our relationship, but I could at least grit my teeth through pregnancy announcements and overhearing everyone else's conversations about scans and showers and all of that painful stuff, and save my tears for later.  

So fast forward to now and we've begun our first IVF cycle.  I am on a long protocol and it's mostly been smooth.  My egg collection was this week and we collected 8 eggs, six mature, and all six fertilised normally via ICSI.  The embryologist scheduled us for a 5 day transfer on Saturday, and we won't hear from them until then (unless, I suppose, the embryos stop growing?)

When I received the call from the embryologist, I was thrilled.  Absolutely completely over the moon thrilled.  For the first time in over a year, I began to daydream about pregnancy and parenthood and all of my buried hopes came rushing back.  I'd honestly forgotten that I even had hopes and dreams like that, because I'd locked them so deep inside.  And it terrified me, because these last almost-two years have been nothing but pain and disappointment and I am so, so scared of falling back there again.  I want this to work so badly, so desperately that I’ve never felt anything more dire.  I’m an atheist and never so much as set foot in a church but this has brought me to my knees.  I don’t know how to balance being hopeful and positive with also feeling realistic—how can I hold on to some positivity but also be realistic?  Is it even possible?  My partner tries to cheer me up by saying “well, this is good news, let’s be optimistic,” but the truth is, there’s about a 38% success rate for my age.

TW: Miscarriage
My husband and I have been trying over two years.  I stopped birth control in August 2015 and didn't get my period for four months.  Then I got it every two weeks.  Then finally about 6 months out it normalized.  Great, I began using OPK's, then temping, trying to figure out when I was ovulating.  Never in my life have I had a positive OPK.  Temps all over the place.  My obgyn started doing progesterone draws on CD 21 and they were always less than 1, confirming no ovulation.  So we started with an RE July 2016, and I started ovulating! My insurance covered IUI's with meds with low co-pays which seemed amazing given how shitty infertility coverage can be.  I got pregnant with my 4th IUI and was so so happy.  Still the happiest 3 weeks of my life I can remember.  At the 7 week ultrasound the pregnancy was dating behind, with no heartbeat.  A few excruciating weeks confirmed it wasn't viable, but my body wasn't picking up on that.  I had a D&C at about 11 weeks, and they confirmed the miscarriage was due to a trisomy.  

I was hopeful I had got pregnant once.  I did 4 more IUI's.  2 with injectables.  All looked pretty textbook, although I've always been a bit of a slow responder to meds.  So I've done 8 total.  I want to scream writing that out.  I just felt like something else was wrong, and asked to have my fertility labs re-tested.  

My AMH dropped from 2.69 in July 2016 to .51 in August 2017.  FUCK! My FSH went from 5.69 to 10.1.  I got this in an email message from my doctor in the middle of France on vacation and spiraled HARD.  I might have drank an entire bottle of wine that night (it was delicious, the hangover not so much).  We had already been planning to do IVF this fall, but my mindset went from ""no guarantees but it will probably work for us"" to ""are we even going to be able to do IVF?"".  The internet was not my friend, I had to stop myself from googling too much.  

Since we've been back I've talked to my doctor who made me slightly more hopeful, his opinion is that although my ovaries are in free fall IVF may still work and some reasons for hope are still my age, my high antral follicle count, and my documented good response to fertility meds.  So ok, there's that.  But his opinion is also that I've got a 6-9 month window to try to salvage whatever I can.  We've got consults set up in October, I'm trying to take this month off from worrying (yeah right) and just focus on being healthy.

Sorry for the long long post.

It took me forever to find a place that cared about this and could do private blood tests to follow up on it.

They said my protein S levels were below the low limit and everything else they checked came back normal (and TSH magically went down from 2.9 a few weeks ago to 2.0 now, although totally different testing locations). But now there's some confusion because the doctor originally thought my last miscarriage was in February, and I just informed her that it was actually in early August, and she said this could have affected the protein S test result, because the value can go down during pregnancy.  So I probably need to get it retested again in my next cycle, when I will already have to decide to do IUI instead of IVF based on this result (I made the decision that if they actually found something obviously abnormal in my tests, I would do IUI again + recommended treatment; if nothing was found, I would ask to move forward with IVF). How long after pregnancy is long enough to test this and be sure that it's truly too low??

Anyway that's the only weird thing I've ever had that could in retrospect be related to this, other than having pretty clotty periods that became much more like liquid blood while taking baby aspirin. But I figured clots during menstruation is just normal?

On one hand I'm relieved that *something* abnormal was found and that it happens to be something completely treatable, even if it's taking daily heparin injections through my entire next pregnancy, should that be so fortunate to ever happen again.

My OBGYN performed a hysteroscopy this past winter to remove what she thought was going to be multiple polyps and turned out to be one (which was removed).  I&#39;m wondering if I actually grew additional polyps in the ensuing months, or if my uterus just looks lumpy during ultrasounds...  Either way, back to the surgical table for me, and more waiting before IVF.....  </p>

Things have just been bad lately, I just lost my job my uni fundings been cut, I think my depression is crawling back, and I don't know if I can pay my rent. 

It's all just too much and no matter where I seem to go I always see an article on how IVF funding has been cut, or someone telling me it's my moral obligation to adopt.

I've been doing medicated cycles for months now (and trying since February) but have only had one truly well-timed cycle that did not result in a pregnancy. I've made many more attempts than that but some were before the polyp was removed and the progesterone was corrected. Others just weren't timed well due to using a donor that is out of state and barriers such as shipping difficulties, planning trips to see him on very short notice, and lastly *his* vacation schedule >:\ 

I've basically turned into a bitter, angry, negative person because I'm so tired of missing cycles for other people's shit (like vacations. Grrrrrrrr!!!!!). I know he works hard and he deserves a vacation. I know I'm being irrational about it. That's why I know I can't do this anymore. SO and I went to see our RE last week to fill out consents to use a sperm bank and to discuss IUI vs. IVF. I feel such a sense of relief that I don't have to consider *anyone's* schedule but my own damn ovary's.  

Our RE suggested trying a cycle or two of IUI since we haven't had very many well-timed cycles and also suggested a new type of IVF called INVOcell. 

Regarding IUI's.... according to her my potential for a pregnancy each cycle with IUI is about $14%. Each cycle is about $3000 including the sperm. To me, those odds just don't seem great and it makes me hesitate to try it given my overall odds. Is there anyone here who is content with their decision to try IUI first? I'm wondering how people who have now moved on to IVF feel about taking the time to do IUI's. Is the general consensus that it was a good experience or that it was a waste of time? My AMH is 2.66 which is good and my other labs were all in normal range. I ovulate every month and have responded well to Letrozole. My progesterone is in the 40's each cycle on lab day. Based on that it seems that I should be a good candidate for IUI. I have very little CM so that very well could be the problem (and I've tried the mucinex, drinking tons of water, etc.).

The second option she suggested was INVOcell IVF. Basically, I do a minimal stimulation protocol and go through an egg harvesting procedure. Following that, the eggs and the sperm are placed in a small capsule together which is inserted into me like a tampon. I basically incubate my own embryos for 5 days then I have the second procedure to place the embryo in my uterus (sorry, I'm new at this-- I don't know the precise term). Extra embryos are frozen for later attempts. The plus side is that the procedure is *substantially* less expensive than IVF. Altogether for retrieval and one attempt it's about $9000. She didn't tell me my exact odds but previously when I asked about my odds of conception she said 50% odds for IVF. So assuming it's the same for this procedure those are substantially better odds than IUI. 

My concerns with this type of IVF is that it's new. It's just coming out of clinical trials where it was successful but I feel unsure about putting that kind of money down to be sort of a guinea pig. I read up a little on the procedure and most of the data I'm finding seems to be sponsored by the makers of INVOcell...That isn't reliable data because it's biased. I did read some personal blogs of women who used it and were successful. The one major downside to the procedure is that less eggs are harvested so fewer embryos develop. If I am successful on the first or second go, this is not too much of an issue--we are a one and done family. But if I have to undergo multiple IVF procedures then the risk of running out of embryos becomes a real consideration. 

Has anyone here heard of INVOcell or even tried it? I'd love to hear your thoughts. I am going to message my RE with these questions as well as ask her for research data that I can look over. This subreddit is such a wealth of information though so I'd love to hear some feedback from y'all as well. 

Thanks so much!

So, hello!

I'm 30 and my husband (32) and I have been trying since June 2016. Like so many people, I was sure it would happen for us right away and spent that first year feeling increasingly sad and a little hopeless. I felt like we were doing everything right--I was confirming ovulation with tests and daily temping, my cycles were normal, we were timing everything right, etc. 

We finally saw an RE in July and did all the testing ordered for us, my husband has had 3 SA's that all looked good, all my blood tests came back looking good, AFC at 18. The only oddity was low vit D levels which I'm now addressing through a prescription strength supplement. Then I had my HSG. The RE let me do it through my normal doc's office so we could save a little money. A week later I got the results back showing both my tubes were blocked.

My RE offered us two options--to repeat the HSG at their center so they could get the images not just the result and confirm the blockage, or go straight to IVF. She recommended the latter because she said a spasm on BOTH sides would be incredibly unlikely. I know this probably sounds silly but the idea of needing IVF completely broke my heart. I decided to repeat the HSG, basically just to stall the IVF convo, and went in the following week to get it done. Immediately after starting the NP doing the test goes ""You've got tubes, girl!"" They called me up the next day and told me to call back on CD1 to start medicated IUI.

My gyn also recommended acupuncture to me and I've been seeing this amazing acupuncturist for a couple months and she is so optimistic for us that with better stress management, acupuncture, herbs, and dietary changes like cutting caffeine, alcohol, and sugar that it can still happen naturally for us.

My girlfriends who know we're trying ALL (literally ALL, I'm not exaggerating) got pregnant on their first try and are so sweet and interested in what we're going through but mostly of the ""relax and it'll happen for you"" ilk. I went out on a limb and told my mom, who I'm pretty close to and is generally pretty supportive, and she responded with something along the lines of ""I'm so sorry honey, it'll happen for it just takes time--a year is not that long. I had three miscarriages, just be glad that's not what's happening."" I know she meant well and I *know* how painful that experience was for her, it just felt sad for me to have her invalidate what I was trying to share. I don't know anyone in real life who has been through this.

Anyway. I feel a little like I'm trapped in a limbo that's entirely my own making. My husband is amazing and will support whatever I want to do but he really does want to keep trying the old fashioned way. He is so optimistic that it will happen for us eventually. I can't get over the dream that it could still work and the bratty, spoiled, ""we-shouldn't-have-to-do-it-this-way"" feeling about IUI or IVF. Unexplained is such a mind fuck--I go between thinking ""something MUST be wrong and we should just start"" to ""there's nothing wrong and we've just had bad luck for 17 straight cycles"" about 10 times a day. I am also obsessed with the idea that if I were healthier--cutting any treats and caffeine and alcohol and carbs and blah blah--if I were as healthy as possible, it would work.

This is our first IVF and we're here because my husband has a blockage and needs TESE surgery retrieval to get sperm. Everything seemed cool with me. AMH 2.1, FSH 7 and everything looks peachy and they started me on the antagonist protocol with no birth control. They said to expect 10-12 eggs, lovely. 

Baseline u/s AFC was only 8. Upped my Gonal F from 200 to 300 (and stayed on Menopur 75) after only 4 growing on day 5. Went today on day 8 and still just 4 follicles. They were 1.3 - 1.5 in size. The doctor said I have a few options. I can cancel and hope that I'll have a higher AFC next time and they'll start me on much higher doses instead of waiting to see how I'll respond, and hopefully recruit more follicles. Or continue but to have my husband go through the pain and expense of the TESE surgery for 4 eggs might not be worth it. I then asked if I can harvest and freeze these eggs to add to our next cycle, and she seemed to think it was a lot of money for that but doable. We have great coverage for meds and paid less than a thousand for everything. 

Cost wise (I'm in Canada) it will be $12,000 to cancel now and just do another cycle from scratch ($2.5k non refundable plus $9.5 k another full IVF/ICSI/TESE) plus meds, or convert this to a freeze all PLUS another full round with the TESE for $15k plus meds. 

We've been waiting SO long to start this because it took forever to diagnose and treat my husband. Also due to scheduling we may not get to try again until Jan due to the urologists schedule for the TESE. I don't mind doing the egg retrieval twice and have already come this far I'm leaning towards freezing these 4 and doing another full cycle. We weren't expecting this today, I feel totally defeated. 

What would you guys do? Is there anything I can do to have more or better follicles next time? I'm a healthy weight, I eat well, exercise.. I don't know what else to do.

I thought you were there, I really did. My body was acting abnormally, giving me what I thought were signs of your creation and growth. My mind went crazy, running through everything I needed to do to prepare for you because it knew without a shadow of a doubt that you were there. 

I talked to you. From the moment you were introduced to me, I tried to do everything right. I changed my diet, eliminating anything that could potentially hurt you. I was kinder to my body physically, simultaneously increasing my exercise while reducing any strain I might experience. Even though your father was away at training, even though I had to put down my dog, even though my mind and heart were in so much pain and turmoil, I stayed away from anything that might chemically calm me. 

Maybe that was my mistake. 

Maybe I needed to take care of myself first. I was so concentrated on you, on this inaccurate gut instinct to protect this small, frail, nonexistent child I had (not) created. I know my emotional state would have affected you if you truly had been there. I tried to keep myself as calm as I could in order to create the most hospitable environment possible for you. It probably wasn't enough. My inordinate stress is likely what kept you from blessing us with your being. Yet even as I type these words, I know this is a ridiculous and untrue sentiment borne from grief. 

You had a 25% chance of being created from the start. Any physical issues I may have only further lowered those odds, and I assuredly have a few. Even all my tissues and organs are perfect, I know my hormones levels and chemical makeup are wrong. I can barely keep myself surviving, so how can I have expected to grow and nurture you properly?

My certainty in your existence scared me towards the end. I thought of all the things I would be missing out on. I primarily focused on all the food and drinks I would be forced to abandon, because come on, it's me. I probably love food more than I loved the thought of you.

And right there, that flippant remark... perhaps that's what did it. I didn't want you enough. I wasn't ready. I was (and remain) in love with the concept of you. I want everything good you could potentially bring to our family, but I'm not prepared for you as a whole, with all the negative things your life would bring. 

Ultimately, I am fully aware there is nothing I could or couldn't have done to make you happen. It doesn't matter how much pineapple I ate, or if I created a Pinterest board dedicated to positive visualizations, or if I had meditated to remain calm, or if I never ingested anything cold ever again, or if I used a heating blanket (which the experts on the message boards assured me was a baby killer).

My RE recommends acupuncture to all of her patients, and I chose an acupuncturist from the handful of brochures and business cards in the clinic lobby. The consultation was free. The acupuncturist asked me to identify a goal, and I said, ""Never to have to do IVF again. I want to have the highest number of good-quality eggs retrieved."" He said the three most important factors for egg quality are sleep, hydration, and protein. His acupuncture and supplement recommendations were:

* one acupuncture session per week until retrieval
* one session before and after FET (we're doing freeze-all)
* B-complex (dosage unknown, as I didn't buy this supplement): 1 at breakfast for general prenatal supplementation and stress
* ProOmegaD (dosage unknown): 2 at breakfast - general prenatal supplementation and egg quality
* Antioxidant formula (vit C, E, and some other stuff - dosage unknown): 1 at breakfast, 2 at bedtime - egg quality (he said this was optional, since I'm already taking 500mg vitamin C)
* Ubiquinol/CoQ10: 1 at breakfast, 1 at dinner - egg quality and circulation (my RE recommended 200mg daily)
* DHEA: 50mg at breakfast - egg quality and count (RE recommended 150mg daily)
* Royal jelly 500mg dehydrated (equivalent to 1500mg fresh): 2 at breakfast - egg count

His dietary recommendations were:

* Drink 3 liters of water daily
* Consume a lot of protein
* Reduce or eliminate alcohol and all soft drinks, including diet
* Consume minimal caffeine, sugar, and wheat flour
* Keep a regular meal schedule
* Have a high-protein breakfast (he recommended 2-3 eggs) without bread, fruit, or juice. Oatmeal is fine.
* Have dinner *at least* two hours before bedtime.

Sleep stuff:

* Keep a regular sleep schedule
* Count 25-50 relaxed, deep breaths at bedtime (this really helped me go to sleep last night when all I wanted to do was browse the internet on my phone!)
* At least 10 minutes of light exercise daily (stretching/walking). No strenuous endurance training. Keep it moderate at most. (I won't follow this and will continue doing hot yoga/barre whenever I can until stimming).

He said that if I was *really* intent on maximizing my egg count/quality, to do the following:

* Eliminate all flour: wheat, coconut, almond, etc. 
* Eliminate high-sugar dairy (i.e., milk). He said cheese and butter are fine.
* Go as low-carb as possible

My first acupuncture session was fine. He placed several needles on my lower abdomen, focused a heat lamp there, and passed an electrical current through them. This is meant to stimulate my ovaries somehow, or increase circulation to them. I was left alone in the room for 25 minutes with calm music playing. Now, I'm not one to take naps, and I even have trouble taking them on weekends and vacations. I was totally *out* within a few minutes, and I had a vivid dream of hanging out with Beyoncé and our babies being friends. I'm not a huge Beyoncé fan, so that was weird, but still pleasant!

Pricing info: 

* Consultation was free. No acupuncture is performed at consultation.
* Intake visit ranges from $165 - $195, depending on # of visits purchased
* Follow-up visits range from $85 - $100

I went to see a new endocrinologist yesterday, she's not a reproductive endocrinologist, just a regular , but she's based at the womens hospital where I'm getting my other treatment and where we started exploring our infertility, so she's hyper aware of all things fertility.

I'm in pre-cancer limbo for a while and I need to get my thyroid, weight and anything else under control while we wait, because:
1 - the mostly free IVF clinic have agreed to take me with some significant weight loss. (~30kgs or 66lbs)
2 - I NEED to do SOMETHING while I wait!!!

So obviously diet, exercise need to be right (check and check), I got a lap band 2 years ago (helped but still not enough, but will be awesome when I'm trying to maintain my weight). I get to increase my thyroxine (c'mon metabolism) and I've started Saxenda injections tonight (thus the title) for weight loss, too. You're not allowed to get pregnant on it so while I'm waiting for my treatment to work I'm going to throw whatever I can at my chubby ass to see what sticks, well preferably melts away, but you get it!

It's $1000 for 3 months, so it better bloody work, and I go back in a month to see how I'm going, if I tolerate it well but still not shifting the weight, we may add more meds to work towards the weight goal for IVF if (when) I get good results after my biopsy in January!

It's so weird, I've always been against drugs for weight loss (for me, no judgement here), I've always been an optimistic fat person who thinks she's got is all under control (news flash, she doesn't) so to take this step is huge, terrifying and exciting! 
The things we do for a chance at making a baby, avoiding a hysterectomy and a cancer diagnosis, huh?

I hope you guys don't mind me journaling a bit here, I take such comfort from everyone here that I feel like I can relax and just be.

We're from the UK but have to travel to Spain for the procedure. We've already had two failed attempts. The first was actually successful, for like two days. A chemical pregnancy I believe it's called. That's the closest we've got.

This section has been provided by ______ Pharmacy to help you plan your actions in case there is a natural disaster 
where you live. Many areas of the United States are prone to natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and 
earthquakes.

Every client/patient receiving services should think about what they would do in the event of an emergency. Our goal is to help 
you plan so that we can try to provide you with the best, most consistent service we can during the emergency. 


*Know What to Expect*

If you have recently moved to this area, take the time to find out what types of natural emergencies have occurred in the past, and what types might be expected.

Find out what, if any, time of year these emergencies are more prevalent. Find out when you should evacuate, and when you shouldn’t.

Your  local  Red  Cross,  local  law  enforcement  agencies,  local  news  and  radio  stations  usually  provide  excellent  information  and tips for planning.


*Know Where to Go*

One of the most important pieces of information you should know is the location of the closest emergency shelter. These shelters are opened to the public during voluntary and mandatory evacuation times. They are usually the safest place for you to go, other than a friend or relative’s home in an unaffected area.

*Know What to Take with You*

If you are going to a shelter, there will be restrictions on what items you can bring with you. Not all shelters have adequate storage facilities for medications that need refrigeration.
We  recommend  that  you  call  ahead  and  find  out  which  shelter  in  your  area  will  let  you  bring  your  medications  and  medical supplies, in addition, let them know if you will be using medical equipment that requires an electrical outlet.

*An Ounce of Prevention...*

We  would  much  rather  prepare  you  for  an  emergency  ahead  of  time  than  wait  until  it  has  happened  and  then  send  you  the  supplies you need. To do this, we need for you to give us as much information as possible before the emergency. We may ask you for the name and phone  number of  a  close  family  member,  or  a  close  friend  or  neighbor.  We  may  ask  you  where  you  will  go  if  an  emergency  occurs. Will you go to a shelter, or a relative’s home? If your doctor has instructed you to go to a hospital, which one is it? 

*Helpful Tips*

* Get a cooler and ice or freezer gel-packs to transport your medication.
* Get all of your medication information and teaching modules together and take them with you if you evacuate.
* Pack  one  week’s  worth  of  supplies  in  a  plastic-lined  box  or  waterproof  tote  bag or tote  box.  Make  sure  the  seal  is  
watertight.
* Make sure to put antibacterial soap and paper towels into your supply kit.
* If possible, get waterless hand disinfectant from a local store. It comes in very handy if you don’t have running water.
* If you are going to a friend or relative’s home during evacuation, leave their phone number and address with ________ Pharmacy. 
* When you return to your home, contact ________ Pharmacy so we can see what supplies you need.

*For More information*

There is much more to know about planning for and surviving during a natural emergency or disaster. To be ready for an emergency, contact your local American Red Cross or Emergency Management Services agency.

*An Important Reminder*

During any emergency situation, if you are unable to contact our company and you are in need of your prescribed medication or
supplies, you must go to the nearest emergency room or other treatment facility for treatment.

where you live. Many areas of the United States are prone to natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and 
earthquakes.</p>

<p>Every client/patient receiving services should think about what they would do in the event of an emergency. Our goal is to help 
you plan so that we can try to provide you with the best, most consistent service we can during the emergency. </p>

<p><em>Know What to Expect</em></p>

<p>If you have recently moved to this area, take the time to find out what types of natural emergencies have occurred in the past, and what types might be expected.</p>

<p>Find out what, if any, time of year these emergencies are more prevalent. Find out when you should evacuate, and when you shouldn’t.</p>

<p>Your  local  Red  Cross,  local  law  enforcement  agencies,  local  news  and  radio  stations  usually  provide  excellent  information  and tips for planning.</p>

<p><em>Know Where to Go</em></p>

<p>One of the most important pieces of information you should know is the location of the closest emergency shelter. These shelters are opened to the public during voluntary and mandatory evacuation times. They are usually the safest place for you to go, other than a friend or relative’s home in an unaffected area.</p>

<p><em>Know What to Take with You</em></p>

<p>If you are going to a shelter, there will be restrictions on what items you can bring with you. Not all shelters have adequate storage facilities for medications that need refrigeration.
We  recommend  that  you  call  ahead  and  find  out  which  shelter  in  your  area  will  let  you  bring  your  medications  and  medical supplies, in addition, let them know if you will be using medical equipment that requires an electrical outlet.</p>

<p><em>An Ounce of Prevention...</em></p>

<p>We  would  much  rather  prepare  you  for  an  emergency  ahead  of  time  than  wait  until  it  has  happened  and  then  send  you  the  supplies you need. To do this, we need for you to give us as much information as possible before the emergency. We may ask you for the name and phone  number of  a  close  family  member,  or  a  close  friend  or  neighbor.  We  may  ask  you  where  you  will  go  if  an  emergency  occurs. Will you go to a shelter, or a relative’s home? If your doctor has instructed you to go to a hospital, which one is it? </p>

<p><em>Helpful Tips</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Get a cooler and ice or freezer gel-packs to transport your medication.</li>
<li>Get all of your medication information and teaching modules together and take them with you if you evacuate.</li>
<li>Pack  one  week’s  worth  of  supplies  in  a  plastic-lined  box  or  waterproof  tote  bag or tote  box.  Make  sure  the  seal  is<br/>
watertight.</li>
<li>Make sure to put antibacterial soap and paper towels into your supply kit.</li>
<li>If possible, get waterless hand disinfectant from a local store. It comes in very handy if you don’t have running water.</li>
<li>If you are going to a friend or relative’s home during evacuation, leave their phone number and address with ________ Pharmacy. </li>
<li>When you return to your home, contact ________ Pharmacy so we can see what supplies you need.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For More information</em></p>

<p>There is much more to know about planning for and surviving during a natural emergency or disaster. To be ready for an emergency, contact your local American Red Cross or Emergency Management Services agency.</p>

<p><em>An Important Reminder</em></p>

<p>During any emergency situation, if you are unable to contact our company and you are in need of your prescribed medication or
supplies, you must go to the nearest emergency room or other treatment facility for treatment.  </p>

I don't have PCOS or any other things that would make OHSS more likely, but this is definitely an unusual response for me.
