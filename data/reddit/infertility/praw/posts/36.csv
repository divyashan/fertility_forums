<p>I had NO intention of posting something that would trigger anyone on the board and if it did, I am very sorry. I should have posted in the results thread. I didn&#39;t know and I got ripped for it. </p>

<p>What hurt was seeing people cheer eachother on for ripping into me and scolding me for my mistake. I thought I could post about my type of infertility struggle but I am realizing now that many don&#39;t see me the same. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve been told &quot;At least you know you can get pregnant&quot; It doesn&#39;t feel like that when ever time you bond with that little seed it dies. I am in an incredibly fragile state and was desperate for support but was met with how wrong I was. It&#39;s ok, I broke the rules. I get it and then I spiraled down all night long. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t read the side bar rules on the app I use and I just didn&#39;t know. I&#39;m sorry. I hope there&#39;s a place in this group for women going through IVF who have recurrent miscarriages. I want the other ladies here to feel supported and loved and I&#39;m sorry if posting about my likely loss was a mistake.</p>

After lurking for quite some time, I've come to a point in my infertility where I have so many questions (google can only answer so much), and after reading so many of your posts, I think that you all have so much knowledge to share. I apologize if this is long, and for all the questions...I'm pretty new to this. Here's my background: 

My husband and I are both 32. We've been married for 4 years, and have TTC for the past 2 years, albeit the first year was no charting, or OPKs. My cycles have always ranged from 28-35 days, with some one-off cycles going up to 40 days (this has only happened twice that I remember, around really stressful times). My doctor suggested charting, which I've been doing for around a year. Even with longer cycles, I'm getting a temp shift, along with a positive OPK; luteal phase is always 13-14 days. Finally after a year of this with no avail, my PCP referred me to an RE in January. My husband's analysis came back a few weeks ago, and the RE had no concerns, and said everything looked good. Are there additional tests that my husband should have done, or is this typically the only one? I've also had a transvaginal ultrasound, which showed I had ""few follicles"" on each ovary, as well as two very small uterine fibroids. Neither my PCP or the RE had concerns about the fibroids. I've had all the necessary blood work done over the past two months, with zero answers to explain why I'm not getting pregnant. Most recently, I've had my AMH levels tested (5.94), and yesterday had the HSG test showing that both tubes are opened. Next step is using clomid and ovidrel in my next cycle. Yesterday's HSG test was on CD16, so we didn't TTC this cycle. I typically ovulate between CD16-20, and after the test (within about 5 minutes) I had TONS of EWCM, like more than I've ever had EVER. I found some stuff online, but nothing to really explain if that's normal, or what it's a sign of.

Lastly...support. 3 out of 4 of my closest friends are pregnant. 3 people I work with are pregnant. I haven't shared our struggle with anyone, as I don't feel like anyone can relate.

Long version: 

If you love uterine biopsies as much as I do, you may be interested in my previous post about my previous Igenomix ERA and e-tegrity beta-3 integrin tests. The goal was to replicate my failed transfer cycle of a PGS normal embryo from August 2016. My first biopsy showed: my uterine lining was pre-receptive by 1 day (Igenomix ERA) and no beta-3 integrin protein (makes sense because pre-receptive).

1. Igenomix ERA (again) - to test whether uterine lining is in-phase (this is a follow-up test, after a slightly different progesterone protocol - 1 unit each day rather than ramping up from 0.5 units).
http://www.igenomix.com/tests/endometrial-receptivity-test-era/

2. Receptiva endometriosis test (NEW!) - to look for latent endometriosis. receptivadx.com

Result:

1. Igenomix ERA showed that I was still pre-receptive by 12 hours. So... getting closer. New progesterone protocol was not enough. 

2. Receptiva endometriosis test: 
This showed an elevated level (score: 2.8) of BCL-6 meaning that I have a level of latent endometriosis. The good news is that it's not a super high level. If it was 3+ or 3.5+ I'd be looking at months of lupron depot treatment (yay menopause). My awesome doctor called the maker of the test and found out that the appropriate treatment for my lower level of BCL-6 is letrozole: https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/27/3/881/640603/Endometrial-receptivity-defects-during-IVF-cycles

Conclusion: Given the ""pre-receptive by 12 hours"" not ""receptive"" result and the fact that no embryo has ever implanted in my uterus - ever - as far as I know, I'm going to be doing a follow-up biopsy at the recommended time in another medicated mock cycle. I'll also be doing the letrozole treatment and using a follow-up Receptiva test to see if the letrozole has lowered my BCL-6 levels enough. Biopsy for the win, I hope. I hope I can take more pain meds next time.

I'm definitely bummed that my transfer is now pushed by another 6 weeks (6 weeks * infinity = infinity) but so glad I did not flush my embryos down the toilet. It's also clear my uterus is picky as fuck, and I hope I have a solution to this nonstick uterus eventually, especially the letrozole treatment. My next biopsy will be mid-March, with the next transfer then around late April. The weeks turn into months and into years, huh?

<p>If you love uterine biopsies as much as I do, you may be interested in my previous post about my previous Igenomix ERA and e-tegrity beta-3 integrin tests. The goal was to replicate my failed transfer cycle of a PGS normal embryo from August 2016. My first biopsy showed: my uterine lining was pre-receptive by 1 day (Igenomix ERA) and no beta-3 integrin protein (makes sense because pre-receptive).

To make a long story short, I saw a few oddities in my paternal matches last year which were confirmed a few weeks ago when a half sibling showed up in my DNA matches.

I grew up with one brother and my parents, who later divorced because of my mother's numerous infidelities. My dad died 20 years ago in an accident. When I saw the half sibling match I made something called a mirror family tree, which is basically a ""fake"" family tree using alternate information from that which you've been told. Lo and behold, when I included this half sibling's father's family information, I found I had DNA matches on both his mother's AND father's side of the family. My brother also took the DNA test and we are full siblings.

I don't have a good relationship with my mother, but I confronted her anyhow and she denied everything. She told me a convoluted story about getting IUI with my father's sperm when I was conceived in the early 80's. She said they had trouble getting pregnant because my dad had an extra chromosome. I researched after the fact that this could have been XXY or XYY. XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) would have rendered him infertile, but would have also presented a host of other problems that I'd never observed in him. It would have made more sense if he had XYY given his physical and mental characteristics, but XYY does not cause IF. Given my mother's propensity for lying and experience as a nurse, she could have been making this up.

Frustrated, I finally wrote a letter to this half sibling's father, who is a doctor, including the DNA and match information. I did not state my conclusions in the letter. 

In the meantime, my mother reached out to me and asked to meet. I thought maybe she wanted to tell me the truth, but instead, she offered to pay for a round of IVF. I'd recently revealed to her that I am IF and would likely require IVF if my husband and I ever wanted children, but we've chosen not to. We are at peace with not having kids, although I can't say we don't still hope it may happen spontaneously one day. I was so pissed off by her offer; I felt like my mother was trying to buy me off rather than admitting the truth of my brother's and my conception.


The doctor responded to my message a few days later and stated that the process was to be confidential at the time, but since I'd gone as far as to contact him, he admitted that he was my and my brother's sperm donor. He said he has 4 daughters with his wife. He didn't give much more detail than that, which is okay with me right now.

I feel vindicated in my suspicions. For a while, I really thought I was losing my mind. It's such a strange thing to learn, in light of my present struggles. I don't blame my mother for using a donor if there truly was MFI; I understand that level of desperation. But I fault her for they lying. My dad has been dead and buried for 20 years, there was no reason to keep the secret, especially since I'm in my mid-thirties and had the DNA evidence in hand. I hate that she gaslighted me and tried to manipulate me using my own IF when she knows first hand how awful it is! It seems she's lied to everyone about this. I may never know the truth of what my father knew, but he was certainly fond of telling my brother and I anecdotes of how we had these shared characteristics of his family. I can't imagine he would have been okay with donor sperm. No one in our extended family gave any hint of even knowing about this.

As for me, the information has been fascinating and terrifying. The science nerd in me keeps saying, ""This is neat"" whereas the philosophical part of me keeps saying, ""I shouldn't exist!"" I've been pretty secure in my identity as an adult, but this information has thrown me for a bit of a loop. I wish I had been told about this when I was younger.

My brother hasn't been handing it well at all. He actually sent me a message saying he didn't want to discuss it at all before I heard from the doctor, so I've just been sitting on this information with my husband and a few, close friends.

Thank you all for reading. I hope this hasn't been too off topic, but it seemed very relevant to me in my journey with IF.

First of all, I'm so glad I found this site -- it feels like a better fit for me than a lot of the other online boards I've seen. So, thank you for being awesome. 

I got diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency / premature ovarian failure (this condition seriously needs a name rebrand) around Christmas. Was super fun.

I'm 27 and my husband and I were ttc for over a year before a cancer diagnosis and possible future infertility for him sent us to a fertility clinic in October (we really should have gone sooner, I know.) We banked a lot of pre-chemo sperm and decided to move forward with an IUI. I had to have a scope test done to determine that IUI was our best move and we found out my tubes are blocked - well that answered a lot of questions right there.

After that we shelled out some dough to try IVF. With our ""package"" we got 3 transfers. I was put on Lupron injections at 10ml from Jan 6-Jan 28, on Jan 20 I started 150ml of Menopur and 300ml of Follistim. I was checked with US on Jan 24 and had 13 follicles all sized around 10-15. They said it looked ""so good"" that they didn't even need to monitor me 2 days later like originally scheduled. Instead they waited until the 28th, when my doctor was out of town mind you, so I had to see the other doctor in the clinic - 14 follicles with the biggest being 18-20, the rest around 14 and one little guy at 10. He sent the info to my doctor who told me to trigger with Pregnyl that night.

Had the retrieval on Monday and got 12 eggs, they called me on Tuesday and told me only 4 eggs were mature, but they were already dying and none of them fertilized. Now they're saying I don't make good enough quality eggs for fertilizing and we need to be looking at donor eggs. They keep saying its very rare for that to happen and they were sorry because they didn't know to be looking for egg quality, I just feel a little shafted. All that time and work and it was over in 24 hours.

I have a consultation with my doctor on Tuesday to discuss future options, but he's still heavily leaning towards donor eggs. I'm trying to put together some questions to be asking him, I obviously want to exhaust all efforts of using my own eggs without breaking the bank..but I also want it to work. Any advice is appreciated!

**edit**

Thank you all so much for the different perspectives. It seriously has helped process some things. 

One thing I just remembered - when I had my scope test at the end of October he kind of rattled off all of the issues he saw with it. I guess I just zeroed in when he said ""tubes blocked"" as to THATS why we hadn't been able to conceive yet..but seeing where I'm at now I think they saw this before and just didn't look into it any deeper.

- Lightly rotated uterus (said there was nothing to worry about with that)
- Left ovary was in the wrong place. It was more tucked behind the uterus and has been difficult to see with the ultrasound since that day. There was also a lot of scarring just in/around that ovary
- Tubes blocked
- Not enough cervical fluid

<p>I&#39;m 27 and my husband and I were ttc for over a year before a cancer diagnosis and possible future infertility for him sent us to a fertility clinic in October (we really should have gone sooner, I know.) We banked a lot of pre-chemo sperm and decided to move forward with an IUI. I had to have a scope test done to determine that IUI was our best move and we found out my tubes are blocked - well that answered a lot of questions right there.</p>

<p>After that we shelled out some dough to try IVF. With our &quot;package&quot; we got 3 transfers. I was put on Lupron injections at 10ml from Jan 6-Jan 28, on Jan 20 I started 150ml of Menopur and 300ml of Follistim. I was checked with US on Jan 24 and had 13 follicles all sized around 10-15. They said it looked &quot;so good&quot; that they didn&#39;t even need to monitor me 2 days later like originally scheduled. Instead they waited until the 28th, when my doctor was out of town mind you, so I had to see the other doctor in the clinic - 14 follicles with the biggest being 18-20, the rest around 14 and one little guy at 10. He sent the info to my doctor who told me to trigger with Pregnyl that night.</p>

<p>Had the retrieval on Monday and got 12 eggs, they called me on Tuesday and told me only 4 eggs were mature, but they were already dying and none of them fertilized. Now they&#39;re saying I don&#39;t make good enough quality eggs for fertilizing and we need to be looking at donor eggs. They keep saying its very rare for that to happen and they were sorry because they didn&#39;t know to be looking for egg quality, I just feel a little shafted. All that time and work and it was over in 24 hours.</p>

<p>I have a consultation with my doctor on Tuesday to discuss future options, but he&#39;s still heavily leaning towards donor eggs. I&#39;m trying to put together some questions to be asking him, I obviously want to exhaust all efforts of using my own eggs without breaking the bank..but I also want it to work. Any advice is appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Thank you all so much for the different perspectives. It seriously has helped process some things. </p>

<p>One thing I just remembered - when I had my scope test at the end of October he kind of rattled off all of the issues he saw with it. I guess I just zeroed in when he said &quot;tubes blocked&quot; as to THATS why we hadn&#39;t been able to conceive yet..but seeing where I&#39;m at now I think they saw this before and just didn&#39;t look into it any deeper.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lightly rotated uterus (said there was nothing to worry about with that)</li>
<li>Left ovary was in the wrong place. It was more tucked behind the uterus and has been difficult to see with the ultrasound since that day. There was also a lot of scarring just in/around that ovary</li>
<li>Tubes blocked</li>
<li>Not enough cervical fluid</li>
<li>They like to see 7-9 eggs in each ovary, and I only had 5 in my right and 2 in my left. I think this is where the whole &quot;you have shitty eggs&quot; talk is coming in.</li>

I guess some part of me just thought last month was just a ""bad egg"" and this month would be fine, especially since by BBT chart has been relatively good this month and all my other blood tests have been normal. But no, my level was basically exactly the same this month as last (7.2 and 7.1). So I guess it's most likely a consistent issue for me. 

I know it's a small problem relative to all the things that can go wrong, but I've also read (and heard from some of you ladies on here) that it's usually not an isolated problem, so I'm frustrated both by the result and by feeling like I'm in the dark and the information I want (what's actually going on!) maybe won't ever be available. Like, WHY is my progesterone low? I know I can supplement it, and that Clomid may help, but I'm just someone who wants to know WHY everything, so that's frustrating. 

Plus I just feel like I've spent the last year and a half spending all my money on supplements and acupuncture and massage and had my sex life turned totally robotic when there was basically no chance of me conceiving with these levels probably the whole time. I guess I'm also frustrated with myself because I wish I'd pushed for more answers sooner. 

Anyway, I also got my LH tested, at the suggestion of several ladies on here. My LH was 3.2, taken the same time as my progesterone (7DPO). My FSH was 5.7, taken CD3 of a previous cycle. Seems like that's okay, though I've seen a few things suggesting that FSH much higher than LH can indicate DOR, but with mine so close together I don't think that's what it's likely showing. Definitely doesn't indicate PCOS, which is what I was concerned about and why I asked for the test. Also, I found out that my AHM was tested CD3 and I was just never given the results (thanks to the person on here who gave me the heads up that Kaiser doesn't send that one to part of your medical record you can see). It was 4.04. So basically I think all my numbers are good except progesterone. 

Anyway, I don't guess I have any specific questions (unless I've said something that doesn't make sense), just needed to vent I guess. 

Next cycle we'll be doing Clomid and I'm going to ask my doctor about possibly starting my SSRI back up again as well to help with possible mental health side effects.

We just met with our fertility doctor today for the first time and he said we have 2 options:

1. I can have a Laparoscopy to assess the damage to my left tube and any other potential scarring or issues to my right tube and uterus.  There is a chance that at that time something could be done to try to repair the left tube during the operation (if it's not a hydrosalpinx but something else), or we will just find out that the HSG was correct and we have to do IVF.  The wait time for a LAP is going to be 3-4 months, and then our DR said 6 months of TTC naturally after that before we should go to IVF

Option 2 is to go straight to IVF which would be significantly more $$, but less invasive, and I have a better chance of becoming pregnant.  We could also start the treatment in March, so if it was successful we would likely be expecting a lot sooner than if we keep trying naturally and wait for the LAP....

**Cups**

I've used a menstrual cup for a few years now and can not say enough good things about it. [For those unfamiliar here's a basic a intro](http://theecofriendlyfamily.com/2012/04/what-menstrual-cup-is-right-for-you/) it's basically a reusable cup that you put up inside your vagina to collect menstruation. There are a couple disposable version now too that I haven't tried but I hear are handy for camping so you're not trying to clean your cup or hands in less then ideal camp settings.
 
Reasons I love the cup:

* Reusable for a long time thus environmentally and financially friendly.

* I had some major dryness issues with tampons, not a problem with the cup

* Less cramping than with tampons

* I can go longer between messing with it (and no TSS risks). I had to change tampons every 3-5 hours. This I pull out and dump every 12 hours (first thing in the morning, and right before bed). On my heaviest day maybe empty once more at lunch time. 

Different brands can feel and fit different. Also most brands have one or two sizes (usually pre and post pregnancy related). They run about $20 up front which kind of sucks if you end up having to buy a couple to find a good one. But once it's in you totally can not feel it. 

**Cloth pads and liners**

So in my other post I was bitching about constantly having to wear panty liners. It's a hassle, they peel off and stick to me, it causes problems/break outs with my skin down there, and I hate the waste. Someone mentioned cloth pads which I had never thought of so I went shopping. I found [this store on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ClothJunkies?ref=l2-shopheader-name) and ordered a few panty liners. And, well, I'm in *love*. They are soooo much more comfortable, they stay in place better, and they breathe so my skin isn't angry at me.

Not sure I'd use the cloth pads for my period, but I don't like any pads for my period. That said for everyday wear for while I'm dealing with FET spackle crotch they are amazing. And the store I found has all sorts of patterns you can pick from so I have sharks, vampires, and party ponies. Which all make me happy.

So do you use cups or cloth pads? Got a store or brand you love? Got questions about using either product?

122,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi there. I'm looking for some of this group's seemingly endless insight. 

My husband and I have been trying for a little over 2 years. After months spent attempting to improve my husband's sperm (low count, motility, morph) and 3 failed IUIs we are finally moving forward with IVF (!!).

I started BCP on cd1 for 9 days. Had my baseline appointment last Friday. My right ovary was quiet while my left one was nowhere to be found (it likes to hide super high, basically behind my lungs). Greenlight on stims pending my blood test results.

Got a call from the nurse Friday evening with some tough news. My E2 was 474 (??!!). All other numbers were in range and my lining had not thickened. 

She said to come in again on Monday for monitoring and we'd put together a game plan. Cue a brutal weekend of waiting and worrying that I won't be able to use the meds that are now occupying my husband's beer space in the fridge.

Went in on Monday and the RE still struggled to see my left ovary, but finally thought he located it AND a 20mm follicle (??!!x2). My E2 was still high. 

We converted to an IUI, I triggered that night, and was instructed to call on CD1 to get back on BCP and suppress for the next cycle starting in March.

My questions:

- That E2 number is really high. Has anyone experienced similar levels from a single maturing follicle? Or have high E2 from another cause at their baseline appt?
- Is it a bad idea to suppress with BCP again when it failed so miserably the first time? Anyone have similar issues with subsequent success?

My nurse and RE assured me that the follicle was spiking my E2 and that a longer run on BCP (should work out to about 24 days of suppression before the next cycle) will prevent this from happening again. 

I just have a hard time trusting that I won't end up on the sidelines again. Guess I'm hoping to find someone with a similar experience that can help me figure out if there are any other considerations I should be taking into account. 

Thanks and warm thoughts to everyone that is kicking around this awful and wonderful subreddit.

 Tl;DR - RE says IUI or IVF is my only option because I ovulate, and husband's sperm looks good. Possible endo diagnosis. Feeling extremely discouraged, and have gotten more and more depressed. 

*BIG SIGH* Okay, so before the holidays husband and I saw our RE for the first time. I like her, she gives off a good vibe. Very scientific, which I like. She's given us more info than our previous doctor, but I'm hesitant. She looked at my info and determined I am  a) 100% ovulating on my own b) do not have PCOS like my OBGYN diagnosed me c) husband's sperm is normal. I should mention we will hit our 2 year actively tracking and trying May/June.

She put us back into unexplained infertility territory, with a 50-60% chance I have endo. Said I could get a laparoscopy if I wanted to confirm that diagnosis, but she would treat me the same whether I have it or not. She did a trans vagnial ultrasound, and said my ovaries looked good. They measured if I'm remembering right about 10cm across, which I thought sounded kind of big. She didn't say anything about it, so I didn't press for information.  There was a corpus luteum or a cyst on my right ovary. She suspected it was a corpus luteum because of where I was at in my cycle. But there was no follow up to double check if it was not a cyst. I had between 7-9 follicles on each ovary. 

She told us our only options that make sense are IUI and IVF. I mentioned maybe having her track one of my cycles unmedicated, and she said it would be a waste of our money because I'm for sure ovulating. I've a lot of tests done, HSG, lots of blood work (never day 3 though) and the sperm has been tested *multiple times* (we were in a medical study for all of last year that focus on sperm production). But I'm wondering if maybe my lining isn't right? Or another problem that could be caught with some monitoring throughout my cycle? Not just day 21s.

I don't feel right about there being no other option outside of an IUI or IVF. Does anyone else also ovulate, that did other things before an IUI? There's got to be something. I did make an appointment to see another specialist that specifically works with endometriosis, that's at the end of this month. 

At the moment we're in limbo, our budget is extremely tight even though I work part time on top of my full time job. It will take us at least a year to save up for an IUI which in all reality isn't insanely expensive (about 3500 *for 3 rounds* at this clinic) but we're just so strapped for cash it will take us a while to save up, which I hate. 

I've honestly been so miserable since that appointment. I hate that there's nothing I can do now but wait, and save for money that we'll never have. Which is an exaggeration, but every bill I pay I just think, ""that could have been IUI money."" Everyone I know is pregnant, the count is at 32 now. My sister in law is pregnant, and that's a whole story I can't get into. She told me how they got pregnant, and I'm not allowed to tell anyone. It's this big secret, and it's driving me crazy.


The RE told me to throw out all of my tracking stuff because we don't need it, just have sex from day 10-20 until we're ready for an IUI. This last cycle we went 12 straight days of sex and honestly I hated it, I don't think I can do that again.  I'd much rather track and then have sex a few days in a row. I'm just at the end of my rope and I feel like I'm not allowed to feel that way because I've never had a MC or a CP, I've never had a single positive. Technically it hasn't even been 2 years yet, so why am I complaining? BLARG!

133,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi. First time poster, long time lurker. I've read this sub for about a year now. Back in July 2014 (Trigger warning!) I had a miscarriage at 17 weeks and then had a really hard time struggling afterwards. I still struggle with memories and post traumatic stress fun now, but the initial year after was extremely hard, and lonely, and isolating especially. There isn't much on the Internet in terms of commiseration for this without being bombarded with perky positivity, but this sub is a pretty special place. I wanted you all to know that.

If I had found this sub back then, I don't think I would have been quite as miserable because you all seem to lean on each other in the best way. It is so refreshing to have people just let feelings happen instead of stifle them-either by saying ""oh that's too negative"" or by saying ""at least"" this or ""at least"" that. It isn't just the internet- it seems like a lot of people in real life have a big problem with realism in regards to tragedy and hard times. I hate it. I've found people who give a shit through a support group, which really helped me survive, but being let down by family and supposed friends still burns my ass. I've cut out a lot of people just for being jerks.

The stuff you say, the feelings you express, make sense to me. I root for all of you in your lives. I love it when good things happen to all of you and it bothers me when bad stuff happens to you, too. I wanted to let you know I give a shit, and your experiences are valid and important to me. It bothers me when people go through struggles of any kind (but especially struggles related to infertility) and are made to feel crazy or invisible, or both. I hate it when people come to this sub and brag (there was an especially egregious one yesterday, yikes) or just ask ignorant questions and my intention in this post is to be the opposite of that. I hate it when you all get triggered or bombarded with baby stuff. There's a lot of times I'll see a commercial or tv show or movie and notice that stuff too, still. I don't think I'm ever going to forget the feelings I felt three years ago.

I was thinking about that shitty year and when I first went to go see a movie by myself which took a lot of effort. It was hard for me to leave the house that year but afterwards I started seeing movies by myself a lot and that helped me. There was a long stretch of time where the best part of my day was when the screen said ""feature presentation"" and the worst part was when the credits rolled and I knew I had to get back to thinking about my own damn life again. I don't know how healthy it was for me to escape my own mind this way and I'm not advocating for it, I'm just saying this helped me personally survive. For what it's worth, I don't regret it.

Anyway, the first movie I saw by myself happened to be ""Gone Girl"" because I just wanted to get out of the house and out of my own head and I'm not very picky when it comes to movies, I'll watch just about anything. I felt really self conscious going by myself but I revved myself up and said fuck it and went. So the movie ends and it sure was a doozy and I'm walking out of the theater and feeling self conscious all over again because like I said I'm by myself and I feel like a loser. There was this other girl alone at the theater that day coming out of the same movie and she saw me and walked up to me with a big smile on her face and said, ""Man, that was some fucked up shit!""

I think about that girl now and then because it was like somebody threw me a goddamned life preserver. It was so nice for somebody else to just acknowledge that something else was fucked up and it wasn't ""God's will"" or ""everything happens for a reason"" or ""you need to move on"" or any of the stupid, insulting shit I heard all that miserable year. For better or worse that ""advice"" has stopped...I think the people who said it just plain forgot about what happened to me (including my own dear old dad) and I feel like the only person who remembers anymore which is a different kind of quiet sort of heavy misery sometimes. I was thinking about that girl, and feeling thankful, and I thought, there really isn't that much difference between that girl and this group in my mind. Just somebody or some bodies out there to be like, ""that sucks"" or whatever, which is just so fucking nice to hear sometimes instead of being invalidated.

Motility varies between 38-46. 
This time (through continues use of clomiphene and FertilAid at RE request):

We got married in August 2014 and after some discussion around waiting until the next year, we decided to try for baby in October 2014. Or rather ""not preventing"". In December of 2014 we actually started tracking and trying. In May of 2015 we got pregnant, MC at 7 weeks in June 2015. Nothing since. Unfortunately the MC also meant my ""one year before they'll test me clock"" got reset and I couldn't get any infertility testing until June 2016. In August 2016 I had a biopsy and HPV along with severe precancerous cells were discovered. In October it was decided I would need to have the Leep procedure to remove them. The Leep procedure meant we had to put baby's on hold until 6 months after, and no testing until 6 months after that. I sobbed. Another year added to this impossible journey. My OBGYN and I decided on a 4 month wait time vs 6 to start trying. She also figured since I was young (24 now 25) we would do all of the fertility procedures (5) at the same time as the Leep and therefore I wouldn't have to wait. Score 1 finally for us. That was finished yesterday. When I woke up I hoped she'd found a reason why we weren't pregnant. She didn't.  Everything is fine, husbands sperm were tested and they're fine. Now every angle of my uterus, tubes and endometrial layers have been checked and they're fine too. So why the fuck are we 2.5 years into this with no baby?? My 18 year old sister found out she's pregnant on Christmas. Her twin is upset because she wanted to get pregnant first.  Neither is in a good relationship or has a good job. I found out Sunday night a friend is 12 weeks pregnant with her boyfriend, one she's nearly broken up with 100 times in the last year.

We got married in August 2014 and after some discussion around waiting until the next year, we decided to try for baby in October 2014. Or rather &quot;not preventing&quot;. In December of 2014 we actually started tracking and trying. In May of 2015 we got pregnant, MC at 7 weeks in June 2015. Nothing since. Unfortunately the MC also meant my &quot;one year before they&#39;ll test me clock&quot; got reset and I couldn&#39;t get any infertility testing until June 2016. In August 2016 I had a biopsy and HPV along with severe precancerous cells were discovered. In October it was decided I would need to have the Leep procedure to remove them. The Leep procedure meant we had to put baby&#39;s on hold until 6 months after, and no testing until 6 months after that. I sobbed. Another year added to this impossible journey. My OBGYN and I decided on a 4 month wait time vs 6 to start trying. She also figured since I was young (24 now 25) we would do all of the fertility procedures (5) at the same time as the Leep and therefore I wouldn&#39;t have to wait. Score 1 finally for us. That was finished yesterday. When I woke up I hoped she&#39;d found a reason why we weren&#39;t pregnant. She didn&#39;t.  Everything is fine, husbands sperm were tested and they&#39;re fine. Now every angle of my uterus, tubes and endometrial layers have been checked and they&#39;re fine too. So why the fuck are we 2.5 years into this with no baby?? My 18 year old sister found out she&#39;s pregnant on Christmas. Her twin is upset because she wanted to get pregnant first.  Neither is in a good relationship or has a good job. I found out Sunday night a friend is 12 weeks pregnant with her boyfriend, one she&#39;s nearly broken up with 100 times in the last year.  I&#39;m happy for them truly but it always sparks the &quot;why you and not me&quot; thoughts. 
That&#39;s my rant and story. Is anyone else in the same &quot;there&#39;s nothing wrong with you, it&#39;ll happen when it happens&quot; boat?</p>

Background-

Sorry this is long. Wish it wasn't!

I am a secondary infertility patient. Been trying for a second child since November 2014. (First pregnancy was a total unicorn-no complications with exception of needing an unexpected c-section) 

Multiple miscarriages pre-fertility treatment- blighted ovum (D&C), 2 chemicals, ectopic with ruptured tube for the grand finale (tube removed). RPL showed everything ok. Hysteroscopy showed polyp that was removed. HSG showed remaining tube ok. Did 2 cycles Femara before I had crazy spotting episode and gave up with OB.

Started with RE February 2016. Was a high responder to stims-had 23 frozen embryos (8 5-day expanded blasts, 2 6-day expanded blasts, rest early blasts) Opted out of PGS testing because we were proven together, assumed tubal factor, and only 33. (I really regret this.)

1st FET transfer was a flat out negative (I struggled with thin lining and my body apparently hates synthetic estrogen)

2nd FET transfer was a stimulated cycle to try to thicken lining. Worked well, was pregnant, lost at 9 weeks. Further tests show MTHFR and Anti-thrombin III deficiency. 

3rd FET transfer was a natural cycle after cancelling a stim cycle in between because body decided not to participate. Natural cycle went well. Added Lovenox. And...embryos (which we thought were great) go to shit. Had to thaw 5 to get 2. Resulted in chemical pregnancy. All 8 5-day blasts now gone. 

If you're still reading-thanks! My RE would like to thaw our remaining embryos (15), PGS test, and refreeze. We don't really want to continue doing the same thing with crap results, and I really can't take many more losses before going insane. Concerned that some of our best embryos didn't even make the thaw for our last transfer, so we are finding it hard to believe they'd survive so much manipulation. Research is spotty at best and seems that different clinics have different opinions.

We would plan to do a full retrieval with PGS if the thaw/biopsy/refreeze/rethaw goes to shit. My hope (ha!) is to have that completed before turning 35 in September.

Thanks for any advice you have. I haven't posted often, but I have learned so much here and find a lot of comfort in knowing I'm not alone.

No real answer as to why I'm not pregnant but I have to get my a1c down 1 point before we can start fertility meds.  

I have an older sister and a younger (31) brother. My sister isn't married and no kids, my brother got married in 2015, about 8 months after I did.  He called me this morning to tell me that him and his wife are expecting their first. I'm sure many of you can relate to this feeling of excitement for them and this pit of despair for yourself.  Apparently they tried 4 months.  I've cried off and on today.  A few things that are really sticking with me is that I don't get to be the one to tell my parents that they are going to be grandparents for the first time anymore. I've imagined that moment, and I'm sure they will still be excited if I get pregnant but it will be different now.

He called me this morning to tell me that him and his wife are expecting their first. I&#39;m sure many of you can relate to this feeling of excitement for them and this pit of despair for yourself.  Apparently they tried 4 months.  I&#39;ve cried off and on today.  A few things that are really sticking with me is that I don&#39;t get to be the one to tell my parents that they are going to be grandparents for the first time anymore.

I posted briefly over at the senior class sub, so if you saw that you can ignore this. A lot of people have been asking about my results (thank you!) so here it goes:

We had 9 embryos make it to Day 5 today, but sadly only 1 was PGS normal. So we transferred that one today.

I'm a whole mix of emotions - I was terrified of having no normals, so I'm definitely grateful for that one, as well as the knowledge that our normal embryos are even possible for us.

However, I'm devastated that we only got the one. Feeling very down about it now.

If you don't know my background, we spent last Sept-Dec doing 3 freeze-all rounds to batch for PGS. We are doing day 3 PGS, which allows for fresh transfer on day 5. This is due to bad luck getting blasts to freeze in the past.

So we thawed our 7 frozen Day-3's we had from those batches and added them to the 5 fresh ones we had on Day 3 this week so all could be biopsied. Results take 48 hours, so it's intense, but it allows for a fresh transfer on Day 5. We did the 3 hour drive to the clinic today not knowing if we even had any embryos to transfer. We found out results at 11, and half an hour later I was doing the transfer!

Anyway, the normal one came from one of the frozen rounds - not sure which yet but I think from the 1st one in September (trying not to think about what if we'd just done the damn PGS then and skipped the useless next 3 rounds. Ugh)

In terms of the HGH, I added it only to this last fresh round. My last 3 banking rounds had pretty low numbers - my left ovary just seemed to be quitting and was only giving one or two follicles. We added HGH to this current round, and lefty had a much better response - 6 follicles. However, of 11 retrieved, only 6 fertilized, 3 made it to day 5 but all were abnormal. So the HGH improved retrieval numbers at least. 

So now we wait. My anxiety is through the roof. But it only takes one, right? (fucking hate that saying). Thank you to all who checked in on me - the support from this group is a godsend! Mwah!


fun bonus info: as we were leaving the room in the clinic today after the transfer, my hubs showed me a post on FB on his phone of my good friend's preg announcement.

I lost my mother when I was twenty-one. I´m in my mid-thirties now, so it´s been quite a while. Nobody ever does, but if anyone ever were to ask me how I dealt with my mother´s death, I would say I didn´t. Ever. I just compartmentalized and managed and somehow life got on. Things like the loss of a loved-one, they don´t get better. But as you move forward through time -as you always do- the time-distance makes them smaller. So they´re not so all-encompassing anymore. They´re easier to .... put aside for a while. 

I´m fine. Usually. But those last months have been trying. Life has been tough. I really want a baby, but that´s very unlikely and as if DOR wouldn´t be a bad enough thing to put you under time-pressure, there´s also a little tumor growing in my head that will eventually have to be removed (the tumor, not the head) and with the medication I will have to take and the DOR that will probably be the end of our race against my failing ovaries. 

Two weeks ago, I went to a new RE. I just called the clinic and they gave me the next available appointment with a free doctor, so I didn´t specifically choose her. But she´s really nice. She´s mid fifties, not exuberant, but cordial.

So good on you folks, this seems like a very healthy community for a very difficult topic. 

I joined so that I could share the story that my wife and I have lived to date, to get an outside perspective and perhaps to get some information/advice from other 'infertility veterans.'

We married in Fall, 2013 and were already trying to get pregnant. She had been on birth control since the age of 17, and she was 33 when we were married. We got pregnant very quickly and were ecstatic. 10 weeks later, she had the first of many miscarriages. 

We have had a total of 6 pregnancies, and 6 miscarriages. We are on our second fertility specialist. The first clinic we worked with had a very standardized protocol, almost a flow chart that they took every patient through... if this happens, you do this, if that happens, you do that. 

We wanted a more personalized, flexible and adaptable approach so after a year we made a switch. 

Our current doctor is great. After the 6th miscarriage, she had to have a DNC. During the post-DNC check-up, one of the awesome doctors at our new clinic spotted a septum in her uterus, which meant another procedure to remove it plus a plastic 'guitar pick baloon' (I don't know how else to describe it) to form her uterus correctly and prevent the septum from coming back. 

Removing the septum gave us renewed hope after 3+ years of trying and way too many miscarriages. We did three IUI's, all failed. 

I guess I should also mention at this point, every test done on my sperm has shown no issues. I don't say that to brag, just to provide context and information. 

After those unsuccessful IUI's, we received major help from our families and moved forward with IVF (trying to remember the protocol, antagonist something...). We had some hiccups with the shots at first, but my wife is a damn trooper and we got through it. 

They retrieved 13 eggs, only two were fertilized so they did a fresh transfer a few days later. 

This past monday, on my birthday of all days, we received news that her pregnancy test was negative. So here we are, just waiting for her period to come and trying to figure out what in the hell we do next. 

Where I am looking for help/advice is twofold: 

1) Her body/mind are so ravaged by three straight years of hormones/shots/procedures that I think she needs a break from all of that and I'm asking her to just try naturally for 2-4 months. The wife gets fertility acupuntcure/massage/chiropractic/herbal treatments (on top of everything else, sheesh) and those folks all agree with me, luckily. 

Has anyone else out there taken a break from all of the 'science' stuff and had success? Any other suggestions? 

2) My wife has gotten really depressed through this entire process. She does see a therapist that specializes in folks struggling with infertility, but I feel her emotions and attitude are going to a very dark place. Every mention of pregnancy on TV or in a movie, anyone she knows that becomes pregnant or has children, they are all treated with disdain, anger and just cut off. 

I am not naive to the fact that these are very legitimate and understandable reactions, and I've found myself feeling anger and jealousy when I see friends making pregnancy or birth announcements... but this is another level. She has completely cut her younger sister out of her life because she had a child and wasn't trying to do so. She has a very close friend that she has cut off, and a lifelong friend who also suffered through infertility but has finally had success - both cut off. Mostly, it's the overwhelming anger that she suffers from that concerns me. I am concerned that her outlook and attitude is having a negative effect on our own infertility struggles... it feels like it's a cycle, the negativity feeds into the infertility, and our continued struggles feeds into the negativity. 

I need advice on breaking that cycle. I'm going to talk to our doctor today and let him know my thoughts. We are scheduled for a meeting with him tomorrow morning to make a plan going forward and I want him to help back me up. 

Any advice or information would be great, especially from women who might have struggled with some of the same feelings my wife is experiencing. I surely do not have the same experience that she does and I recognize that I will never fully understand it. I also know that many of those feelings are normal and legitimate... but I honestly believe that what she is experiencing is beyond the norm and bordering on dangerous.

I have called my local rep...  I have called congressmen Hice.  I have openly railed to rally others to share in my anger and act by calling their reps...  I marched last Sat in Seattle before knowing of this bill but my personal reasons were to stand for my rights as a woman.  

Hice's office said ""oh we're not anti-ivf, that's not what this is""...  And I asked...  So what about pgs testing and if we chose not to transfer a bad embryo? ""Oh...  I don't know the answer to that.""  Right because you didn't think about that.  And they vowed to get back to me with answers.  I have sent both th messenger and fb page message with the list of questions resolve poses as issues with a personhood bill...  I don't expect answers but I think I may call every day and ask them one by one daily.  

I've contacted my RE to express my concern.  His response:

""We are actively fighting HR 586.  This type of legislation has been proposed many times at both the state and federal level and rarely makes it out of committee.  At this time there is no law and likely will not be one.  We face this type of bill being introduced every year. ""

And sure, he's trying to say...  In the past it's gone no where...  But we have a GOP controlled house and senate here and a president who I can't depend on to veto this if it does happen to go forward to that point.  And a VP if somehow the president is impeached that wants personhood.  

So here we are...  With a hard conversation.  The uncertainty of IF and IVF being successful is hard enough.  

Please, don't stop talking about this.  We have to speak up...  We have to be loud.

Yesterday AM was my &quot;Day 3&quot; blood draw and they kept my prescriptions the same so I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m responding okay enough.</p>

I didn't have a ""real"" period for 6 months, and was extremely worried, especially since many pregnancy tests came back negative, so I knew I wasn't pregnant.

Some history - I am in mid 30's, no kids. My Fibroids were discovered during 1st pregnancy, though initially was told would not cause any harm, had miscarriage at 23 weeks. 2 fibroids are towards outside, 1 intramural, and 1 about 6cm submucosal, which is the main cause of concern as its occupying the cavity. My OBGYN asked me to see a RE.


**Reproductive Endocrinologist**- suggested to do laparoscopic surgery to remove the fibroids. He also said we may have to have IVF later on if Fallopian tubes get damaged or scarring. He is ready to do the surgery in 2 weeks, hasn't asked for MRI or additional imaging/tests.
We went for an second opinion, to a Gyn surgeon.


**Gynecologic surgeon** - Thinks its safer in my case to go with abdominal myomectomy, even though he is well known robotic/laparoscopic surgeon, as the one inside cavity needs to be carefully removed and endometrial lining preserved. He thinks surgeon will have full/better control during the procedure to do a clean job and suture it well, so that it doesn't rupture during future pregnancy. He wants to atleast do an MRI before surgery to see exactly whats going on.  He did not suggest IVF or anything yet and is optimistic everything will be fine afterwards, even though recovery time is slightly longer.

I'm joining you this evening from the corner of my couch, as I pop another Motrin and open the bottle of wine I have been drooling over for the past two weeks -- in a vain attempt to cure the cramps that kindly reminded me today that we failed again.

Almost two years to the day, we started trying and now we're staring down the start of IUI cycle #3 this week with a scheduled reconsult with our RE. 
I'm 27, and was diagnosed last December with PCOS after almost of a year of trying with no success. I've always had normal periods, but suffer horrendous cramps and other fun side effects like severe nausea. After 8 years on birth control (and with none of those fun symptoms), I guess it's no surprise PCOS finally reared its ugly head to screw us over. My husband is 29 and his semen analysis came back ok. After the usual tests and an HSG for good measure confirmed I haven't been ovulating but egg count and quality look good, we were encouraged to give timed intercourse a try with the usual cocktail: Femara, Metformin (the ""devil"" drug as I affectionately call it), and Ovidrel to trigger. We were told by the doctor and pharmacists that we wouldn't be here long. 

Five failed medicated timed intercourse cycles and a deployment later, we're now reeling from a surprise pregnancy announcement from my younger sister in law (typical ""we only tried for two months and now we get to bring the first grandchild into the world! blah blah blah) despite her knowing about our struggle. After I got over my meltdown and jealous rage a few months ago, we moved on to IUI. The holidays with the in laws and golden daughter were, as you might imagine, a real blast.

So far, no dice. Last cycle, after only one ovary decided to barely respond to meds and the sperm sample showed some possible motility issues, we were advised to set up a reconsult, which in my mind, means we're probably going to talk IVF once this next IUI cycle fails. 

Some days, I wonder how almost 2 years (1.5 when you factor in deployment) got here so fast. Like many of you, I remember the day I threw my birth control pills away and stupidly thought, ""This year, everything is going to change!"" And boy, has it. With this latest failed cycle, it stings a little more than usual -- it was the last chance for my husband to physically be here for a success before he deploys again in the fall. Like so many of you, I'm tired of this bullshit emotional rollercoaster ride, and while I want off, I am terrified of the prospect of being forced to jump. I'm tired of life revolving around ultrasounds, blood work, catheters, pills, shots, and two week waits. Despite having much to be thankful for, this shitstorm of a journey continues to break us down little by little.

Sob story now complete, I wanted to thank you guys for getting me through some of the dark days of waiting, of despair, and even the few moments of fleeting hope. I find myself cheering for you guys daily and I don't know how I would have made it so far without your awesomely bitter humor, soul baring experiences, and sincere encouragement. Some days, you take the words I can't bear to utter out loud right out of my mouth. I am grateful for this space, and I am ready to finally join you all here if you'll have me.

<p>Almost two years to the day, we started trying and now we&#39;re staring down the start of IUI cycle #3 this week with a scheduled reconsult with our RE. 
I&#39;m 27, and was diagnosed last December with PCOS after almost of a year of trying with no success. I&#39;ve always had normal periods, but suffer horrendous cramps and other fun side effects like severe nausea. After 8 years on birth control (and with none of those fun symptoms), I guess it&#39;s no surprise PCOS finally reared its ugly head to screw us over. My husband is 29 and his semen analysis came back ok. After the usual tests and an HSG for good measure confirmed I haven&#39;t been ovulating but egg count and quality look good, we were encouraged to give timed intercourse a try with the usual cocktail: Femara, Metformin (the &quot;devil&quot; drug as I affectionately call it), and Ovidrel to trigger. We were told by the doctor and pharmacists that we wouldn&#39;t be here long. </p>

Some place ideas:

1) if Vancouver Islanders want to join, we could do it near Tsawwassen Mills as there is a free shuttle from the ferry so no need to bring a car over.

2) if Washingtonians AND Vancouver Islanders want to join, we could still do it at Tsawwassen Mills, but at the Tim Hortons so we can wow you with timbits.

3) if it's just the Vancouver people, let us know some good ideas for meeting up.

Some date ideas:

We were thinking maybe Feb 11/12 or Feb 18/19?

I don't think reddit does group messages, so if you want to PM us with your email address and place/date preferences and we'll try to come up with a workable plan.

We're looking forward to seeing some folks if you can make it!

I am wondering what your thoughts are about controlling obsessiveness when it comes to IVF. 

I have been looking at all of the possibilities and getting consumed by the language and concepts. (And I have been lurking/reading IFsenior class -- so many great contributions there). But of course there is no limit or end to what is there to be learned.  

It isn't healthy, but I find myself relating everything to a previous loss, and that lends a sense of urgency. like if I don't learn everything then I might have to go through that kind of loss again. I get that this is illogical; correlative instead of causative. 

Am I the only one? Does this happen occasionally? if so, does it pass?

<p>Ugh. Sorry, I just needed to rant a little. I&#39;ve been lurking for a while, and I&#39;ve commented on others&#39; posts a few times, but I guess I could go ahead and do an intro. We&#39;ve been trying for 4.5 years now, with many starts and stops for both emotional and physical reasons. We came out to family after about 3 years thinking we&#39;d get support; instead we got shat on in the moment, and ignored ever since. </p>

<p>In December I was finally diagnosed with both PCOS and endo. Yay? I&#39;m glad to have something to point to, but I&#39;m kinda tired of my body being an asshole, too, y&#39;know? We live 4 hours from the closest fertility clinic so it&#39;s going to take a while for us to really get this train going thanks to the stupid logistics, but at least we have a plan now.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening to me a rant a little, and for having such a supportive community here. I&#39;m not exactly glad to be here, as I&#39;m sure you can all understand, but it does feel good(ish?) to know I&#39;m not alone.</p>

While we were going through our IVF treatments, we thought at some point our medical coverage might change and it would no longer be covered... so we stockpiled some of the more expensive fertility drugs.
My dilemma (and question) is that now that we have decided not to do a 3rd round of IVF, I have all of these meds and I sincerely don't want to just chuck them away after how ridiculously expensive they were... and at the same time, I am scared of any legal ramifications of giving them away even though they have been held in all the proper conditions since receiving them and are 100% good to go. (I also just want to see them work for someone who is on this journey and do something positive to be totally honest.)

Looking for counsel here on what to do about giving them away or throwing them away (yikes). Sincerely would like to give them a good home... but afraid...

I've been doing a lot of research on various uterine receptivity tests as it seems I may have something going on after 3 failures with PGS embryos.

I'm waiting to do a second ERA test, but now I'm wondering if I should also do this test called e-tegrity that looks for whether your lining has a certain kind of protein that allows for implantation.

The ERA seems to be getting a lot more attention but maybe that's because it's newer. Does anyone know if the e-tegrity test is also something one should get one if they've had multiple failed implantations? Or is it only indicated in certain situations? Is one more ""informative"" than the other?

I've been reading online that CCRM only does the e-tegrity test and not the ERA...that seems strange to me, since it seems like many women have been helped by the ERA. But I'm learning the hard way that IVF doctors tend to have their own beliefs about things that are often contradictory.

I'm really struggling. Maybe it's because we didn't wait. As soon as we got married, we started TTC. Maybe that's our problem. But it's bad. It's like we are just roommates who have to have sex. Not even like, oh fun sex, just like, we have to. I can't even say we are friends because if a friend called and said ""oh hey I'm so stressed about work"" I would talk to them about it and try to hep. When my husband says the same thing, I have to force myself to not tell him to suck it up. I resent him so much. Not because of his MFI, but because his lack of ownership and support. Everytime I come up with a plan, IUI, IVF, fosterr care, adoption, he shoots them all down. Because ""it'll happen."" He's so against trying everything, but he also doesn't want to adopt the childless life. So I can't seek treatment, but I also am not allowed to move on with my life. So it's limbo and I resent him for putting me here with no way out. There is no support when I cry about being depressed about all this beyond the ""have hope, it'll happen.""
