We got into this gig for the love of it before we were aware of our fertility issues. I had been a teacher at a non profit preschool for several years and delt with the local child protection services often. One of the biggest problems I noticed was the lack of available safe and secure homes for children, and I said then, that as soon as I was stable enough to do so I would become a foster parent. 

Currently we have a sibling set (9 months old and 19 months old) that each entered our care at birth, and we are on track to adopt the older one this year!!

I would love to answer any questions you have about foster care, and share information from my own experience, but please keep in mind that every state has different rules and regulations and I can only speak to my home state. I encourage anyone interested in foster care to contact your local child protection service agency and ask specifics!

**Schedule is now finalized (as of 2:30pm CST 4/23/18)**

Special shout out to /u/dawndilioso for her work on this project!

**If you are taking part in the AMAs and came to us from another subreddit, please familiarize yourself with [our sub’s rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7ol945/read_this_before_postingcommenting_important_sub/)**  The mods will be reviewing the AMAs as they are taking place (where possible) to ensure the rules are being followed.  The most relevant guideline is:

>Mention of pregnancy or live children is a touchy subject in this forum, but may be discussed in neutral, sensitive language, especially in the context of making an introduction or answering a question about success with a particular treatment protocol. Statements of medical facts are very helpful (ex. “We had success after using xyz protocol"" instead of ""my first IUI resulted in my 2 year old daughter""), but unprompted discussion of pregnancy or children may not be well-received and may be removed.

**Monday, April 23rd, /u/underscore77 (Lindsey) will be doing an AMA from 8:00 am to 11:00 am CST regarding foster care and her foster to adopt experience** 

[AMA Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8eb50a/hi_im_lindsey_and_im_a_foster_and_preadoptive/)

*TW: This AMA may contain triggers due to discussions of past and current children in her care.*

*Lindsey has been a licensed foster parent for two years and has shared her home with 14 children, which included some beautiful reunification stories and seeing children off to their adoptive homes. Currently she is on track to adopt her child from foster care, whom she has had since their birth 19 months ago. She would be glad to answer questions regarding this experience. Please keep in mind that every state has different regulations and limitations on foster care and she can only speak to her own state and her own experiences.*

**Tuesday, April 24th, Nick Stretchbery, the Business Intelligence Manager of Fertility Centers of Illinois /u/AMillionDollarBaby will be doing an AMA starting at 12 pm CST/1pm EST/ 10am PST**

[AMA Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8em3qh/hi_im_nick_and_i_am_the_business_intelligence/)

*Each visit at every one of those clinics creates an immense amount of information, from lab results to insurance claims and processing, that all needs to be organized, analyzed, and optimized. Enter: Business Intelligence. Nick and his team work with every department to ensure that patient data is properly cared for and analyzed to provide the best patient experience possible. Take it where you want! He’ll talk about anything you ask – insurance questions, what it’s like to go through treatment (or, rather, what it’s like to watch someone you love go through treatment), navigating all of the ins-and-outs of the treatment process, interesting behind the scenes tidbits – so come with everything you’ve ever been curious about. If he can’t answer something, he’ll definitely find someone who can.*

Our typical day consists of minor/major surgery cases, diagnostic testing, and procedures such as intrauterine insemination all the way to in vitro fertilization egg retrievals and embryo transfers. Our practice focus includes polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), unexplained infertility, male infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, third party reproduction (egg donation, sperm donation, gestational surrogacy), basic infertility treatments (ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination), and advanced fertility treatments (In vitro fertilization, preimplantation genetic testing/diagnosis, comprehensive chromosome screening).*

Primarily our job focuses on the day that sperm and eggs come together and extends to when the embryo is transferred back. Between that time so many parts are moving and patients rarely get an in depth explanation about this. What started out as an fun hobby on Instagram has now led to 1000’s of patients getting the chance to speak 1 on 1 with the real baby-makers in an unbiased, informative format.

* Is it weird that we're leaving out Menopur? From what I've read, it looks like some REs don't like to use Menopur for PCOS patients.
* She seemed to leave it up to us whether or not we do ICSI. I really don't know what to do here... I would think that fertilization rates are better with ICSI?
* Is 150 iu of Puregon high enough? With Gonal, I would start around 75 and go up to 112.5 so I don't see how 150 is going to help multiple follicles develop.
* She suggested that we consider PGS if we end up with a lot of embryos. I'm on the fence about this. Any thoughts?

[I posted about that here.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7p1cyn/should_we_move_onto_donor_egg_or_try_round_3_of/) 

We ended up getting a second opinion and decided to go with a new RE. My husband called the surro agency to transfer our surrogate's medical history, and the head of the surro agency said: ""That doctor will never approve her"". We were like, um, why not?? When we next met with our new RE, she told us she would have never done that transfer because our surrogate had ""dangerously low iron levels"" and that it could be an indicator of a more serious health issue. She said it was not something that could be rectified with some iron supplements. This was news to us. We were never informed about this from our previous RE or agency. Our new RE said it was a serious issue that needed to be addressed before we moved forward with her and also noted that they barely received any medical background paperwork on her from our previous RE clinic or our surrogate agency. We contacted both the agency & clinic numerous times to get the proper background info and in the midst of trying to get it, our surrogate quit. She said it was because she was having major health problems from her low iron! At this point, we had literally JUST found out this was even an issue and it was now months after the transfer and she quit because of this ongoing health problem. We were and continue to be very upset that we did that transfer when the surrogate was sick and were never informed. 

We have yet to discuss this with our previous RE. The surro agency reassured us that they had plenty of surrogates that our new RE *would* approve and proceeded to send us profiles--one had multiple c-sections, one was 39 years old, one was clinically obese,  one has numerous pre-term labors. Our new RE rejected one that seemed maybe ok but had too may c-sections. I did not even bother to send the others to her because even I could tell they were NOT great and would be rejected. 

So now we are strongly considering hirng a different surro agency, which is obviously even more $$$. The old agency also informed us there is a $7,500 rematch fee even though our surro literally quit on us (& was sick).

I don't even know what my question is. I am just so sick of being lied to & taken advantage of in this shitty process. I guess I am wondering what any of you would do in our situation?

We opted to go straight to IVF with donor eggs. That was four years ago. Our first two batches of donor egg embryos all arrested before transfer (two different donors). Our third batch producted 6 PGS tested normal embryos. We transferred all of them over five cycles. I just got the call today that our very last transfer was a negative.

We’ve both had all the tests my RE can think of. My uterus has been probed, biopsied, and filled with saline so many times it feels like an old football. We’re talking about moving on to donor embryos now, but I’m terrified those won’t work either. Our bad track record with embryos arresting and my husband’s history with MFI suggests it might be a sperm problem (though apparently nothing that shows up on standard tests), but what if I’m killing them somehow and throwing a bunch of donor embryos into me does nothing but waste them?

A few final steps, if you're so inclined: 

* Please RSVP/sign up to bring something at [this link](http://polljunkie.com/poll/ynbocr/if-meetup-what-were-bringing). See what others are bringing [here](http://polljunkie.com/poll/imzoen/if-meetup-what-were-bringing/view)

* I'd like to be able to reach you if we have trouble finding each other once at the park. I'm not familiar with it beyond what I've seen on a map, so I think having contact info would be a good safeguard against losing anyone or going to the wrong spot. To that end: how can we create some kind of group chat? My first idea was to have everyone PM me their numbers, and then I can create a group text. However, if you're uncomfortable with that, could you recommend an alternative? Another user suggested I send my number to everyone, but then I won't have any way to reach you if I change the picnic spot. So, how can we manage this?

Meetup details:

* When: Saturday, 1pm
* Where: Lakeside Park, Oakland. I think the pergola area looks like it will work, so that's where I'm planning to set up. You can see it in the upper right section of [this map](http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/opr/documents/marketingmaterial/oak056316.pdf). 

* If you've got picnic blankets, bring 'em! Even better if they're plastic lined on the bottom, since I've read that the geese can be a little messy.

Here's the list of people I've been updating. If you're not on it, but want to come, just let us know! Also, please remember that if you've gotten a positive test, it would be best to bow out quietly so we can try and maintain the fun :)

We'll need to go through IVF + PGD. We understand that theoretically there's a 25/25/50 chance the embyro is normal/balanced translocation/abnormal. So if our aim is to implant 2 normal blastocysts we should try for 8 to go through PGD (25% of 8)

I went to my first RE appointment last cycle. I’m 34, secondary infertility, been trying without a single positive test for 13 cycles at that time. 14 now.

For many reasons at the appointment I told the RE we were really information seeking, it was not likely we would seek treatment but for the hope of regaining sanity I needed some answers as to why this unexpected infertility. Doc was pleasant we had about a 20 minute consultation in which he explained to me my options dependent on what we learned.

We go into the ultrasound, he sees five AFs on left, 2 on right. He says well it’s not impossible for you to get pregnant but lower your expectations, I’ll let you process that, shakes my hand and leaves. At this point I have literally no idea what has just happened.

I get bloodwork drawn, go home, get on google and realize wait a minute, woah, what the heck! 

Office never calls with bloodwork results. Through persistence I basically learn that they have an IUI nurse and an IVF nurse and because I was with neither of them I fell through a paperwork hole. When they finally do call me sir results nurse says AMH is 0.2 and I stop her there - which I regret - and say hey I want to talk about these results. I’m 34. Am I going into menopause what’s up? She says yes ok we will call you back.

Obviously they never do.

So I decide to find a new office. Get an appointment, fill out paperwork. I don’t trust they will send records so I call 1 week out to check. They haven’t sent them. I call office. When office hears it’s for a fertility clinic they charge me $25 and then say well it takes two weeks to send records but I’ll see what I can do.

To no surprise my appt is Wednesday. I really want to learn what my bloodwork said. My FSH, my estradiol, etc. it’s been a month of suspense. 

But realistically I probably won’t have that information for this new doctor on Wednesday. 

My question is this. I am going to this new dr on a different day than the previous. It was CD 3 and this one will be CD 15. Should I go ahead and go in and re do the tests anyway? Can they confirm ovulation by looking at me now and then comparing to the results when they get them?

Doc was pleasant we had about a 20 minute consultation in which he explained to me my options dependent on what we learned.</p>

<p>We go into the ultrasound, he sees five AFs on left, 2 on right. He says well it’s not impossible for you to get pregnant but lower your expectations, I’ll let you process that, shakes my hand and leaves. At this point I have literally no idea what has just happened.</p>

<p>I get bloodwork drawn, go home, get on google and realize wait a minute, woah, what the heck! </p>

<p>Office never calls with bloodwork results. Through persistence I basically learn that they have an IUI nurse and an IVF nurse and because I was with neither of them I fell through a paperwork hole. When they finally do call me sir results nurse says AMH is 0.2 and I stop her there - which I regret - and say hey I want to talk about these results. I’m 34. Am I going into menopause what’s up? She says yes ok we will call you back.</p>

<p>Obviously they never do.</p>

<p>So I decide to find a new office. Get an appointment, fill out paperwork. I don’t trust they will send records so I call 1 week out to check. They haven’t sent them. I call office. When office hears it’s for a fertility clinic they charge me $25 and then say well it takes two weeks to send records but I’ll see what I can do.</p>

<p>To no surprise my appt is Wednesday. I really want to learn what my bloodwork said. My FSH, my estradiol, etc. it’s been a month of suspense. </p>

<p>But realistically I probably won’t have that information for this new doctor on Wednesday. </p>

<p>My question is this. I am going to this new dr on a different day than the previous. It was CD 3 and this one will be CD 15. Should I go ahead and go in and re do the tests anyway? Can they confirm ovulation by looking at me now and then comparing to the results when they get them?</p>

<p>Or should I just cancel and move the appointment to next month?</p>

102,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I spoke with the genetics counselor at my clinic about the changing technology around PGS testing and mosaics and learned a few things that I thought were interesting.  We did three rounds of banking with PGS testing last year, and as of that time the lab we used, Reprogenetics, was still doing standard PGS.  In that process they take 3-5 cells from what will become the placenta to test.  If most of the cells are normal it’s considered a normal embryo, if most of the cells are abnormal it’s considered an abnormal embryo.  It sounds like they couldn’t tell how many cells were which though.  With NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) they can now determine how many cells are normal or abnormal.  From the sounds of it, this only became a customer offering in the last year or less.  From CooperGenomics (who now owns Reprogenetics in this case) they categorize like this:  

0-1/5 cells abnormal = normal (>80% normal)  
2/5 cells abnormal = “low-level mosaic” (60-80% normal)  
3-4/5 cells abnormal = “high-level mosaic” (20-60% normal)  
5/5 cells abnormal = abnormal  

However, the clinic can choose to know the mosaics or not.  If the clinic chooses not to know they follow a logic that would mimic the old PGS results where the low-level are considered normal and the high-level are considered abnormal.

So overall, old PGS testing is treating low-level mosaics as normal already.  Research shows that mosaics with less than 50% abnormalities have a live birth rate of 42.2%, where as normal embryos are 46.6%.  Mosaics with greater than 50% abnormalities have a live birth rate of 15%.  With standard PGS you are already getting those embryos transferred.  With NGS the only difference is that you now know what the degree of abnormality actually is and can choose to transfer the high-level mosaics that would previously have been considered abnormal.
The counselor also confirmed the research I’d seen previous that approximately 25% of embryos are actually mosaic and that percentage does not change with age.

If you are forgoing PGS testing because you are concerned about a discarded mosaic potentially being successful you need to consider what type of testing your clinic is doing.  Standard PGS testing is likely netting you the mosaics with the best chance of success already.  Not testing at all or NGS effectively only gets you the additional high-level mosaics that have a 15% success rate.  With NGS testing you have a choice to transfer them, while still avoiding the abnormals that would not be successful.  

I confirmed that my clinic is saving all mosaics now that they can be identified.  They have confidence in transferring the low-level mosaics since they were effectively being transferred under the normal label previously, but they are cautious about transferring the high-level mosaics because of the low success rates.

My wife and I decided before we started this entire process that we would try IVF 3 times and then call it quits. We've gone through 2 IVF cycles with spectacular failure with no embryos making it to 5 days. Both times we transferred 3 3-day embryos without success. So we've decided to move on to donor eggs due to egg quality and DOR. 

After multiple searches and tons of profiles, we found the perfect candidate with ethnicity, age, and personality that really resonated with my wife. Unfortuntately, the donor never responded to the agency so they changed her status to archive. So we started over again, but the problem is there's not a lot of new donors or turnover for the criteria we are looking for as we're both half Asian. 

We narrowed the list down to two donors. They both have pros and cons for each. 

**Donor 1:**

* Previous donor (3 cycles averaging 20 eggs per cycle)
* Absolutely beautiful (occupation is model)
* Asian Ethnicity (1/2 Chinese, 1/4 Korean, 1/4 Japanese)
* Local 
* Extremely expensive ($30k donor fee, $15k agency fee)
* Age - 28

* New donor
* Average looks 
* Full Korean (my wife's ethnicity)
* Other side of the country so travel expenses
* Average costs ($10k donor fee, $10k agency fee)
* Age - 20


We're covering all the IVF costs ourselves. Currently paying off the two previous IVF cycles. Our family (wife is very close to hers) has stated multiple times not to worry about money and that they'll help but we haven't asked them. 

We're debating if the ~$25k difference is worth it. We've joked that shouldn't we try to set our future kids (if successful) up for success by being good looking. This whole damn thing feels like we're on Tinder swiping left and right on candidates.

We've been TTC for 18 months and waiting for 6 months for my husband's open enrollment to start so that we could switch coverage to the HMO they offered from the high deductible plan we're on now. We're in Illinois so all HMOs are required to comply with the full Illinois infertility mandate, covering up to 4 IVF retrievals for primary infertility (up to 6 total). For whatever reason, many companies are like my husband's and only offer complete IF coverage on one plan; the rest only offer diagnostic coverage with ""treatment of the underlying condition"" (doesn't help us, we're unexplained). Well, his company has pulled the HMO it seems, and all of the other plans are ""diagnostic only"". Husband wasn't able to make it to the meeting last week and we only got a chance to look at the full benefits explanation last night. No plan is offering coverage according to the full requirements of the Illinois mandate (including the IVF requirements). My question is, is this legal? Does anyone have any clue if companies in Illinois are obliged to offer at least one plan that meets with the full requirements of the mandate? I know my husband is a valued employee and I'd hope he'd be able to have some leverage with his bosses to solve this, but it sucks that as a discreet guy he's going to have to be upfront about something he'd rather keep private. We're also in a horrible time bind because his open enrollment starts Monday and we're leaving the country on vacation on Tuesday. Enrollment closes before we get back so we need as much information as we can collect now, before he talks to his office tomorrow. (This is not exactly what I had in mind for obsessing over on my vacation.)

In anticipation of any questions about why we're not on my insurance, my employer is Catholic so they won't even cover birth control. :/ I don't know if it's worth the threat of leaving - neither of us really wants to leave our jobs but in a state with mandated coverage, it doesn't make sense to stay with an employer who won't cover your disease treatment.

I wrote this letter to my friends, with whom I've been largely silent, and wanted to share it here in case it reverberates with anyone else. 

Dear friends, 


I’m writing from the hospital, where I’m being treated for an ectopic pregnancy (if you don’t know what it is, try not to Google image search it). This is our fourth pregnancy loss over the course of the last three years. These years have been hard, and we’ve grown in ways I never thought we would need to. But I’ve also shrunk away from people I care about, and who care about me, as it got harder to be honest about what was going on. I’ve told some of you parts of what we’re going through and I’ve told some of you nothing, and I’m sorry. There’s no rhyme or reason to it. 


For a long time, I assumed that I’d tell you all when we could put a neat bow on the narrative of these years, after our child was born, in passing, “Oof, getting here took a long and hard road.” We did a round of IVF last summer, after our third miscarriage, and produced two genetically abnormal embryos, neither fit for transfer. 2015, 2016, 2017, and now 2018 are the years that held our losses. Their details don’t seem important now, and we’ve learned that losing a pregnancy is a thing that can physically take weeks or months. Due dates don’t matter anymore, as every month of the year holds some marking point to remember. And though the times of loss have been dark, life has happened. They haven’t been the everything of us. We have laughed and had joy and been ourselves through them. We had a giggle fit over nothing this morning while checking into surgery. I love this man beside me with everything I have. 


And even as we’ve lived, it hasn’t felt real to respond, “Everything’s fine,” when you’ve asked, and it’s felt exhausting and painful to go into it all. And out of fear of either option, I’ve slowly stopped asking how you’re doing because I don’t want to need to respond. I’ve left social media, I’ve hidden in bathrooms, I’ve walked out of parties, I’ve disappeared from lots of spaces that I used to love as they became painful. 


The truth is, I’m not sure what has kept us going. We can happily and readily imagine life without a child, or especially with children that aren’t biologically related to us. We’ve had so much time to kick the tires around our desire to become parents that we’ve dismantled the car and rebuilt it. I think it became hard to walk away, and each loss made me want to make it right, as if going on to have a healthy pregnancy would be the thing that could fix our hearts from all of the loss and failure. It won’t. I’m not sure where we’re going next, but I’m feeling a great deal of peace right now because we are for once in a moment of choice. 


I’ve made the decision that, in addition to removing the pregnancy that’s currently threatening to burst my right Fallopian tube, I will have both tubes removed today. The doctor who has been following us through this has been wonderful and supportive, and there’s not a doubt that this is the right thing to do. It is a beautiful and powerful decision that means to us that 2019 will not hold another miscarriage. Good riddance.

She showed me a picture of my insides, and my tube looks rather bunched up, and my ovaries are 'kissing', aka stuck together, behind my uterus. It was a shock because she only suspected very mild endo based on my symptoms. Yesterday was lots of crying. 

IVF is an option. We are also talking about surgery. She is recommending a surgeon who is one of the leading gynecologic surgeons in the country. He uses a technology for excision called JPlasma laser for really really precise excision and much less risk of damage to surrounding tissue. They might be able to get me in as soon as May, which is the next time this surgeon is in my city.

Of course, no guarantees that this will unblock my tubes. But in case it might, I want to give it a shot. Otherwise, it's IVF for me. Which scared me at first. But after talking with my husband (who was so supportive and willing to do whatever it takes).. I feel better about it if it comes to that. At worst, the endo surgery will give me a healthier body to move forward with IVF.

I'm still kind of in rough shape. I don't know much about advanced endo, since I never though or expected to have it. Success stories don't seem very common, and while I want to have hope that at least one tube could be unblocked, I also don't want to give myself false hope.

Nostalgia got the better of me and I tuned into Roseanne. Kinda regretting it. The entire Becky is a surrogate plotline is terrible. Episode 4 annoyed the crap out of me. Becky lied about her age (43) and just found out her eggs aren't viable and she has less than a 5% chance of becoming pregnant. The woman who hired her coldly says she's not getting any younger and just bounces. I...I..I have no words. Wtf did I just watch? Wtf just happened here? 

Then I was surfing Instagram and a trailer for a new Charlize Theron movie came on. ""Tully"" is about a stressed out, mom of 3 with a new infant, a husband, and a free night nanny bumbling her way through parenthood. She spilled the breast milk! Hilarious. Screaming in the parking lot. Bahahah, parenting! Isn't she amAzing?!

150,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello, everyone.  I have mostly been lurking here the past few months, since I was diagnosed with DOR (AMH 0.7/FSH 14.3/AFC 6).  There is so much helpful information and I am continuously amazed by the support everyone gives each other.

I am going to be starting my first IVF cycle in mid-May.  I spoke with the nurse yesterday, and she said that they are going to put me on BCPs prior to the cycle and start me on Metformin (no diabetes but they want me on it to prevent miscarriage if I get that far).  For my actual stim meds, this is what they are going to prescribe:

300 IU Menopur in the morning
300 IU Follistim or Gonal-F in the evening
Omnitrope 3 vials
Cetrotide or Ganirelix
Pregnyl or Novarel trigger 1 vial
Lupron 0.8 cc trigger x 2

Does this sound like an appropriate protocol for someone with DOR?  From reading here, it seems like BCPs can cause over-suppression and higher doses of FSH may not work well because my FSH is already high.   I’m trying to decide if I should really argue the point with my RE, but he’s previously dismissed the idea of priming with something other than BCPs and a microflare protocol.  I’m kind of thinking maybe I just go with it for the first cycle and see what happens, but we are going to be paying ~$10,000 out of pocket per cycle and I’d like to make sure we are giving it our best shot each time.  

Thanks in advance for any info/opinions you provide!

I'm re-watching Angels in America, damn the series is so well done, a few small triggers one of the female characters mentions having a loss and mentions wanting a baby, but really not a part of the series in a big way. 

Excited for Grey's tonight. 

Married At First Sight-damn this week was intense! Such drama between Jon & Molly. If anyone watches this show I feel like Shaunice and Jepthye are going to end up with like 20 dogs, because whenever they have a fight he's going to buy her a new dog. 

Suits-back but I'm kind of meh on this last season, the story line has gone way into unbelievable land. But I wonder how they'll end it.

Re-watching some scary movies since tomorrow is Friday the 13th, I kind of love The Omen remake. 

Mary Kills People-had the season finale which is weird since I feel like it just started, but I really like this show, highly recommend.

Alex, Inc-The new Zach Braff show, I enjoy it so far, they have kids but not a huge part of the show.

Rise-Highly recommend, good trigger free so far enjoyable show. 

Billions-On Showtime, great casting, love it.

Silicon Valley-This show is so funny, glad my husband talked me into watching it.

Looming Tower on Hulu-It's a dark topic, but I love this show. There's only one more episode though next week.

<p>I&#39;m re-watching Angels in America, damn the series is so well done, a few small triggers one of the female characters mentions having a loss and mentions wanting a baby, but really not a part of the series in a big way. </p>

<p>Excited for Grey&#39;s tonight. </p>

<p>Married At First Sight-damn this week was intense! Such drama between Jon &amp; Molly. If anyone watches this show I feel like Shaunice and Jepthye are going to end up with like 20 dogs, because whenever they have a fight he&#39;s going to buy her a new dog. </p>

<p>Suits-back but I&#39;m kind of meh on this last season, the story line has gone way into unbelievable land. But I wonder how they&#39;ll end it.</p>

<p>Re-watching some scary movies since tomorrow is Friday the 13th, I kind of love The Omen remake. </p>

<p>Mary Kills People-had the season finale which is weird since I feel like it just started, but I really like this show, highly recommend.</p>

<p>Alex, Inc-The new Zach Braff show, I enjoy it so far, they have kids but not a huge part of the show.</p>

<p>Rise-Highly recommend, good trigger free so far enjoyable show. </p>

<p>Billions-On Showtime, great casting, love it.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley-This show is so funny, glad my husband talked me into watching it.</p>

<p>Looming Tower on Hulu-It&#39;s a dark topic, but I love this show. There&#39;s only one more episode though next week. </p>

I'm in Ontario, Canada. I was instructed to take milk of magnesia two nights before, Ativan the night before, and one Ativan an hour or two before the procedure. I was taken into the recovery room, hooked up to an IV to get some fluids, walked into the surgical room myself and hopped up onto the table. My husband was with me (including a cool hairnet and face mask) and was allowed to hold my hand and touch my face. I was awake for the whole procedure, but they pushed fentanyl and I had some local numbing in the vaginal canal. It was painful, but on a scale of 1-10 I'd classify it as about a 6, and I'm a big wimp about stuff like that. When I said it hurt, they gave me some more drugs, and I squeezed my husband's hand when it hurt me. I had a nurse on my other side holding my other hand as well. 

It took maybe 15 minutes? Then they helped me off the table, into the wheelchair, and back into the recovery room where I dozed for a few minutes before waking up.

But um yea. Its getting worse. as sadly many of you know with PCOS increased Acne everywhere, hair in bad places, uncontrollable weight, hormonal issues and the works are signs. But I got medication to help and its starting not to work. Its starting to be a glorified acne and hair controller. *Metformin for those wondering* the pains are still coming worse as the cysts pop and hurt. The pains are also going lower. And overall, things are so bad now. And I can't even take a anti-depressant to help with my depression. Because that drove me worse and it seems if I try to take both medications they cancel each other or makes the depression/hormonal imbalance worse. So no anti-depressant. And whats worse to me is that I've started getting hives. On my neck *which makes me think its acne and when its to late I realize its not*, on my thighs, and legs, including my behind.

*to be clear, I went through all I was eating to ensure it was not an allergen because I got a few of those and its not. its actual hives*

Now I admit I was not ready to be a mother and he had just left and it was best he left because he was a horrid man but back then I didn't think it was apart of anything. but over the years I started to get the signs and I did nothing.

*to explain mum had a worse set of PCOS and literally should not have been able to get pregnant but did with me. I would not turn, and other complications. But I was born safely as possible* 

But the thing is, due to my relationship of the past, I haven't exactly dated much. Meaning since I was 19, I've been on 3 dates and one fun night with a great guy. *completely safe with protection etc* and I don't feel safe with most guys, so I'm the odd duck.

I Am moving to -state- soon and I have decided to go with IVF with a friend donating or not. But I'm scared. I really am scared, because I know its expensive and semi-dangerous and sadly not 100 percent chances. I'm 24 and this may be my only way to be a biological mum, *I don't have anyone to surrogate. And honestly I can't do that to someone. For them to carry a baby for 9 months then to have to hand them over? its cruel to me and I can't do that to them. but I'm so scared. I can't easily go to family because they won't understand me. They never went thru fertility issues, they don't have PCOS, They have SO's to support them...I've nothing like that.

I'm just scared that I'll get the news that I can never have a child on my own, even with IVF.....

and I'm thinking about when I get to -state- I'm gonna get in with a clinic and work on starting IVF processes *i mean hormonal medications etc* to be ready when I go through with the rest....

I&#39;m 24 and this may be my only way to be a biological mum, *I don&#39;t have anyone to surrogate. And honestly I can&#39;t do that to someone. For them to carry a baby for 9 months then to have to hand them over? its cruel to me and I can&#39;t do that to them. but I&#39;m so scared. I can&#39;t easily go to family because they won&#39;t understand me. They never went thru fertility issues, they don&#39;t have PCOS, They have SO&#39;s to support them...I&#39;ve nothing like that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just scared that I&#39;ll get the news that I can never have a child on my own, even with IVF.....</p>

<p>and I&#39;m thinking about when I get to -state- I&#39;m gonna get in with a clinic and work on starting IVF processes <em>i mean hormonal medications etc</em> to be ready when I go through with the rest....</p>

<p>sorry its so jumbled...I&#39;m just so stressed and scared and unsure of everything...</p>

169,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I've been procrastinating on writing this standalone post. 
I wanted to walk-through my thought process on deciding to do a Laparoscopy/Hysteroscopy and the questions I asked my Doctor.

**Background:**
I've gone through 4 egg retrievals (about to start number 5) and had 2 failed normal pgs tested FETs. First was chemical and second was miscarriage at 6w3d. In between the FETs, I did an ERA mock cycle which indicated I needed an extra day of progesterone. 
Our diagnosis is MFI and DOR (although that is questionable, since my ERs range from 5,10,6,7). My last tested amh was 1.53. 
However, I am a slow responder to stimms and my typical duration is 12-14 days on meds. 
I have normal periods (no extreme pain) and regular bleeding. 

**Surgery consultation:**
After the last failed FET, I switched clinics. My new RE suggested a diagnostic Laparoscopy/Hysteroscopy surgery. His hypothesis was I had an hydrosalpinx tube that was impacting the implementation. At this point, I was googling frantically on ""hydrosalpinx"".

My Doctor was very good at mentally preparing me for the possible outcomes. Here are the questions I asked and his responses:

* I have no painful periods, a clear HSG and SIS. Why do I need a Lap/hysteroscopy?
Failed pgs FETs is a symptom and an indicator that something else is wrong. Lap is the ""gold standard"" to see if there are any issues that cannot be seen via MRI/SIS/HSG/Ultrasound. The Doctor is literally looking at your ovaries, tubes etc (lap) AND on the inside of your uterus (hysteroscopy)  

* Why do I need surgery? Can I take the BCL-6 test?
No, we do not do that test because it is not FDA approved for Endo diagnosis. NOTE <- other clinics do this test. Its relatively new.

* What other issues will you look for?
Polyps, Endo, Uterus structure is normal, issues with your tubes etc.

* What will you do if you find Endo?
I will either burn or cut it out depending on where it is and the severity of it. Specifically, if it will impact your fertility.
FYI - he did find tiny bit of Endo, he was pressed to call it stage one, which he burned off.

* Will the Lap impact my fertility? Or cause my numbers to drop?
No, my Dr's focus was on tubes only. His main concern is to maintain fertility. If he sees Endo wrapped around my ovaries, it would cause more damage to remove it than leave it alone.
I had to sign a waiver understanding the worst-case scenario is, I wake up with both tubes removed.

* Why do you need to remove the tube(s) if there is an issue? Why can't you just unblock it or fix it? 
No, those are temporary fixes and no guarantee that it wont revert back to the same issue. If your primary goal is to get pregnant and you are doing IVF, the best approach would be to remove it.
He said stats show after tube removal due to hydrosalpinx, implantation percentages go up. [link](http://www.ivf1.com/hydrosalpinx-infertility-ivf/)

Finally, he emphasized it was my decision to make. He would be ok if I wanted to try another IVF cycle without doing the Lap first. However, it was his recommendation to do it. Logic being why waste time and money when there may be an underlying reason for the failed FETs.
If I do the Lap and there are no issues, that would be one more thing off the list to check.
If I redo the HSG and it was inconclusive, a Lap would still be needed to definitively say there are no problems. Note: that my first HSG was clear!

**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**
Lap is still surgery and should be taken seriously.  I've read some horror stories on Laps gone wrong. You need to weigh-out the pros and cons before making that decision.

For me it was the right choice. He removed my right tube because of hydrosalpinx. It was really twisted and inflamed, there was some flow going through the tube, but it didn't look normal compared to my left side. He showed me photos afterwards.
He said it looked like there was scarring on the tube, but he doesn't know when or what caused it.

We are starting IVF number 5 now and I am feeling more positive about this cycle.

So my insurance (Aetna) only uses centers that they’ve contracted with and called centers of excellence. However, there’s not one in my state, so I’m jumping through hoops to figure out how to get this covered (with my plan they should cover at 100% other than pgs). 

Step 1) Obtained “network deficiency exception” or “gap exception” stating that they’ll treat my center as if it is in network
Step 2) Obtained letter with every single CPT code that they’ll cover 
—- this was a pain because since my insurance doesn’t require preauth for IVF. So no one would give me a preauth letter. Except my center requires it. And then then the insurance authorized HCPC codes and not CPT codes. And the center will only do CPT codes.
Step 3) Now the center is telling me that they “balance bill” and since they’re not in-network I may end up with a huge bill anyway (e.g. their insurance rate is $15K, if the insurance says $10K is what they negotiate with other folks and is all they’ll pay, I get billed the other $5K out of pocket).

The other option is to do the self-pay rate of only $10K.. then send it to my insurance company who will cover 80/20 for the first $10K($2K my share), then will pay 100%. However, with this plan they will also only pay out their negotiated rate - which means I could still end up paying more due to “balance billing.” I don’t know if the clinic gives me an itemized receipt with CPT codes to submit here. If they’re charging me the self-pay rate, can I still submit to my insurance?

So scenario 1 I have no idea what I’ll be responsible for. It could be almost nothing, it could be a lot($7K/$8K max?). I won’t know until the bill comes. 
In scenario 2 I know I have to pay the first $2k, but then I don’t know after that. Possibly less “extra” but also I could run the risk of the insurance covering nothing.

My mom took me to the appointment. We were in the waiting room and she kept going on about how she read/ saw something about people getting pregnant on vacation and asked if I had thought about going on a holiday. 😒🙄

Onto the appointment. Apparently I had a severe infection that affected both my ovaries and tubes resulting in removal of one ovary and tube. Well apparently now I have to wait at least another 3 months before I can even think about any intervention because they want the ovary to heal completely before even attempting to do any stims. There’s also only a slim chance that the other tube survived all the damage which means we would have to do IVF. By the time we get all our ducks in a row I’ll have been benched for at least 14 months.

Hubby also needs to go for a semen analysis before we have an appointment with our RE. He called the lab for an appointment and the earliest one is at the end of May. I mean it’s not a big deal given that we can’t do anything for 3 months, but I find myself frustrated nonetheless.

205,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi,

I'm looking for some advice/recommendations on moving to a DOR specialty clinic (is there such a thing?…) I am in the southeast, but have basically exhausted my local options. (current clinic is my third opinion..) Feasibly I could drive to Atlanta, or a clinic in the Northeast I could fly to relatively easily (ideally one that is used to travel patients…)   My local RE would likely be willing to help me out with some satellite monitoring..  I've been reading about Cornell for DOR?  

I guess my actual question is does anyone have any advice?  And what’s the benefit/what would be different?  I have had it explained to me by my current RE when I asked about a specialist is that protocols are basically the same and there is some degree of chance/luck depending on your response that month – and a specialist wouldn’t make a difference.   

My stats:

3 early losses from trying naturally (one was confirmed trisomy)  Whole RPL workup- nothing came back except for low AMH 0.6, FSH 11.8   AMH retested at a different lab at 0.9.   Good AFC, usually around 10ish, but I don’t respond well to stims.  Strategy was to go to IVF with PGS testing to hopefully avoid another loss and because I have fantastic insurance coverage.   


IVF #1: at a local large hospital clinic, BCP before stims, microdose Lupron protocol with HGH, lead follicles, retrieval anyway, 4 mature, 3 fert, 1 day 5 blast, PGS abnormal.  No way to really adjust my protocol here, have to be on bcp before.. so I changed clinics.

 
IVF #2: small clinic, everything starts when I start my cycle.  Individualized treatments.  Did an Estrogen and cetrotide primed antagonist cycle. Regular stims…I forget the amount.  Really really slow growth.. retrieved anyway, premature ovulation thru cetrotide before retrieval of my 2 largest follicles.  Nada from this cycle.


IVF #3: same clinic, long/luteal Lupron cycle, higher stims, 150 menopur, 375 gonal f, great response.  10 eggs but only 4 mature, were expecting more to be mature. (2 matured overnight at the lab and fert next day) so 6 fertilized total, none made it to day 5, just fizzled out.

 

We are now exploring the idea of more of a natural/mini cycle at my same clinic. (currently about to do my first IUI cycle, femara and gonal f with trigger) Idea being to monitor my response, try an iui, if I have a decent response we could possibly try a retrieval down the road. (Not guaranteed... Just mentioned..)

 

Issues I have with my current clinic:  They have great SART data… and I think they might be encouraging me to not do another IVF attempt because of their scores.  (Personally I don’t care, if an IUI is the best decision for me that is fine, I just want something to work!  And I am not convinced that they are sending me down the wrong path but I feel like it is skewing the information.) Also, my current RE doesn’t think that there is any merit to adding DHEA or HGH or supplements, and I know there is controversy over them but I know for some people they may make a difference. (Only one he's good with is coq 10).    Also, I have asked a few times about trying the microdose Lupron protocol again (possibly adding testosterone priming..) because that's the only one where I got an actual blast....and I get dismissed... Like, 'oh, well it didn't work before'... (Part of me thinks that it is because that was the cycle I did at the previous/competing clinic... That he was trying to improve upon...)  But I dunno.. It was pretty shitty too... Just not the worst one. 


Sorry this has become a rant..  I've already starting to process the option of moving into donor eggs but I want to make sure I've explored all my options first.  


Apologies for the long post and I appreciate the feedback!

Apparently they couldn’t even get to one ovary. And the surgery took a little more than 2 hours. I mean, I can’t say he didn’t try. (I was told that’s a long time?)

218,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello!  Just found this sub a few weeks ago and I can't tell you how immensely helpful it has been for me.  So, firstly I want to thank you all for being the one and only place where I feel like people actually know exactly what I'm going through and feeling.

A little background on me:  Have always wanted to be a mom since I can remember.  In fact, I used to pretend I was pregnant with a balloon in under my shirt when I was a little girl and spent my teens and 20's dreaming of having four kids, and was always making lists of what I would name my children.  Got married 2 years ago (29 at the time, I'm 31 now) went off birth control, and was so excited to finally make my dream come true and start having babies!  And, naive me just figured I'd get pregnant within a few months (actually convinced myself that I would have a ""honeymoon"" baby!).  All the women in my family have had no issues getting pregnant.  I actually have quite a few relatives that are only 11 months apart.  

So, my next year was spent using OPKs, tracking my cycle on FLO, taking my BBT, eating all the right foods, not drinking any coffee or alcohol, trying every possible position, or suggestion anyone would throw at me, all the yoga and ""fertility"" meditations, you name it, I have likely tried it.  So, a year goes by and I'm just in shock.  The hubs and I are very happily married and have an active sex life, how could I possibly not be pregnant?  Always went to the gyno every year for annual check-ups with no issues, other than bad cramps during my period (which I was always told was nothing to worry about).   Cycle is very regular, 28 days every months and I generally ovulate on the 14th day.  What the heck could be wrong?

So, after a year and a few months, I asked my gyno to refer me to a fertility specialist (this was actually an ordeal as for some reason my gyno does not believe that people need to go to a fertility specialist and gave me a whole weird speech about how in Haiti no one seeks out fertility specialists and there are no issues with getting pregnant, and some people just take longer than others and we just need to be patient...that's a whole other story - and I will not be going back there).  We finally get referred to an RE and go through all the extensive and expensive testing and all the results are great....until the HSG.  This was incredibly painful and when we discovered that I have a blocked right tube.  I was devastated, and still am.  

So, the last 8 months have been spent doing medicated TI cycles and IUI's (all failed).  Having only 1 decent tube adds the complication of only being able to do the IUI's when I have a follicle on the left side.  And, lucky me seems to produce follicles only on the right side for months at a time, even with Clomid and Femara.  Clomid has also given me some pretty painful cysts, causing canceled cycles.  So, I've only been able to do 2 IUI's since starting fertility treatment.  This last one hit me harder than I could have every imagined.  I scream cried on the bathroom floor after I got my period and had to actually ask my boss to leave work the next day because I could not stop crying at my desk.  

I have recently started doing acupuncture and therapy and the two have really been helpful for my overall well being.  I actually love going to both.  Currently taking this month and next month off to decompress, and then we'll meet with our RE to discuss what our next plan of action is.

So, that was quite the wordy introduction, but I know how helpful it has been for me to read all of your stories and I hope this atleast connects with someone to know they are not alone in this very painful and emotional journey.

I just found this subreddit a few days ago and decided to joined for the first time, mainly because of the intelligent and supportive comments throughout, and because I have no other outlet to truly express my frustration at this IF journey. You guys seem like the only ones who would truly understand. 

We are in the TWW of IUI #1 after having tried on our own for a year. My well-intentioned husband wanted to help distract me from the hellish over-analyzing that consumes me during the TWW. So he proposed that we go see a movie – Game Night, a light-hearted comedy/mystery about “A group of friends who meet regularly for game nights find themselves entangled in a real-life mystery,” straight from IMDB. What could possibly go wrong? *eyeroll*

I’ll just rant about the subplot that no one really cares about except for people who are struggling with IF, but to cover my bases, SPOILER ALERT!!!

So it turns out, one of the underlying subplots is that the main couple is having trouble conceiving. In one of the very first scenes, they’re meeting with the fertility specialist, and the whole conversation is a stupid, tactless mockery of a consult. The RE says that stress from game competition could affect sperm motility, and then ends up asking for a date with the main character’s brother. I get that it’s a comedy and no one bought a movie ticket to get an education in Fertility 101. I get it. But it stung to unexpectedly see this difficult process of a fertility consultation be mocked and trivialized on the giant screen. I turned to my husband and said “What the fuck? I thought we signed up for a movie about games!”

Throughout the movie, they made off-hand jokes about helping Max (Jason Bateman) boost his sperm motility by finally beating his seemingly successful brother in various games. (Yup, that’s exactly how sperm biology works.) I could have left the theater in one piece if that was the extent of it. But no… the movie culminates with a 3 month time lapse, and the final scene is a game of charades where Annie (Rachel McAdams) literally draws a bun ... in ... you guessed it... an oven... as an announcement. Like really? Really?? Is that how it works?! 

I get that I’m more sensitive to these things than the movie’s intended audience. I’m not mad at the moviemakers. Okay, maybe a little. Aren’t there endless other topics to mock and trivialize other than fertility? Literally, they could’ve made this subplot about anything else and none of the movie would change. Rather, I’m more angry that I can’t even go see a movie without life reminding me of our shortcomings. How pathetic is it that a seemingly innocent movie could make me feel so irritated? Infertility distorts everything. 

Not sure if anyone has seen the movie or will see it. We literally had no idea that this subplot was part of this movie. I wish I knew it contained IF triggers. If I knew, I wouldn’t have seen it. Lesson learned: look up plots, subplots, and sub-subplots of all the movies we see from now on. 

I feel better after this rant. Feel free to tell me to snap back and stop overreacting; I already know I am being overly dramatic.☺

* What to bring: Please use [this link](http://polljunkie.com/poll/ynbocr/if-meetup-what-were-bringing) to sign up to bring something, if you're so inclined. Before signing up, use [this link](http://polljunkie.com/poll/imzoen/if-meetup-what-were-bringing/view) to check what people have already signed up for. It looks like alcohol is not allowed, so I plan to bring it in some kind of clever hiding contraption. We will also need picnic blankets; I have two that I can bring, but the more we have, the cozier we'll be. Maybe even outdoor pillows?


A small bit of housekeeping: If, between now and the meetup, you get a positive beta/HPT, I think it would be wise to quietly bow out of the meetup. No need to send a message; I think that'll save all of us, myself included, some pain, and keep the day as free and fun as possible.

My husband and I are just starting our 3rd IVF stims this week after 6 medicated IUIs over 3+ years... during this time we only have shared our struggles with a few friends as I can't deal with all the questions - I find it too stressful to have to share our sad stories on demand - so we keep our circle tight and super private.

One of my girlfriends who knew about our struggles never really came to visit us (we moved out of town), or followed up to see how I was doing, or what results were... so we started to not include her in the happenings...

Her comments were really lacking in empathy and she seemed to really not understand how hard this was on our hearts, to have such a f*d up experience...
One example is that once I was complaining about not having cocktails due to the IVF treatments and mentioning how hard it is to put life on hold, and the response I got was ""why is it hard? You wouldn't drink if you were pregnant, so not drinking when you're trying to get pregnant should be a given... I mean if you really are committing to a baby, why are you complaining about not having a cocktail?"". 
When this happened - I remember my ""inside voice"" wondering how she might feel about a 3 year long pregnancy (basically was I to assume that from her perspective nothing I had to give up or any pain I had to experience throughout all of my infertility treatments were off limits as a complaint or inconvenience?)... I found comments like this so obnoxious... and so lacking in any sort of empathy... 
Other comments included irritating opinions about treatment and a know-it-all mentality when it was clear she didnt really understand IVF or the process, or how difficult is was physically or emotionally. It's just IVF. No biggie.

Fast forward to her husband finally agreeing to try for a kid... and on her second IUI, she got pregnant.
I have barely heard from this friend for the last year... and suddenly I got the ""yay we're pregnant"" news.. UGH!

Then I got a text message a few weeks later saying she had an ectopic pregnancy. So I immediately sent notes and flowers and felt really bad for them, and also felt bad for having difficult feelings toward her not showing up for me.. because it wasn't important - they were going through the worst kind of hell... 
So I made excuses for her, even though my husband was irate at how I was being so responsive when she had basically been MIA from our lives for a year+...

And fast forward to a text today saying they are really excited about their next IUI coming up soon...

So here I am with all my bad feelings about a selfish friendship and wondering if I am only feeling this way because of my own struggles or because she hasn't cared one lick about what we are going through, and hasn't bothered to ask either... and maybe I just need to stop being responsive and let the friendship just fizzle out. Because at the end of the day - aren't your friends who supposedly love and care about you, and who are in the inner circle of this infertility hell, supposed to show up?
Please feel free to tell me to get over myself... or please tell me to lose the friendship - I'm just totally at a loss.  My husband however wants to leave it in the rear-view mirror for good...

245,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,
All of a sudden we find ourselves at a huge crossroads. Multiple crossroads. Have you ever seen a spaghetti-junction? (google image search that absurdness). That is us, right now. 
Yesterday we got the disappointing news of our negative beta for our 5th try at IUI with donor sperm. In the same communication, we also received the news that our RE is now going into research, and we were assigned to a new resident trainee at the clinic. We also got the go ahead that the next step should be IVF w/ ICSI.

Our 5 tries at IUI history is as such: 4 failed IUIs, 1 success ending in trisomy 20. Cycles have been medicated from everything from clomid, to letrozole, HCG trigger, to Ovidrel. My average was typically 2 follicles per medicated IUI, but with clomid I over-responded. I have a low AMH for my age (about the average for someone 10 years older than myself), but a seemingly very high AFC. These results have been labeled ""incongruent"" and a suggested diagnosis of DOR has been addressed. With the cost of donor sperm being as it is, we are at this point ready to call it quits with the IUIs. I am mentally ready to do my funded attempt at IVF. 

Realistically, this will probably be our last ditch effort. I don't think I could fathom the cost of an additional unfunded cycle. I have a lot of anxiety re: spending money, and even unloading the money we have into 5 failed attempts has been hard for me to deal with. 

Cross-roads questions:

1)I am really uncomfortable with being assigned to a trainee RE for my one shot at IVF. I think I would like to look into transferring to a satellite of the clinic which is closer to my new work. In doing this, I would also get to switch out of this new trainee's caseload and onto a much more experienced RE. The only downside to this is potentially having a longer wait time for my funded cycle. Opinions?

2) We had some shitty luck with donors during the IUI process. Our first donor was someone we really both loved. We bought 3 vials from him to start. It quickly became apparent after two cycles that his numbers just sucked. 5 million, and 2.5 million were post-double-wash counts (our clinic has a mandatory wash policy on even pre-washed vials). We decided to forgo using the 3rd vial and instead did the subsequent 3 IUIs with 2 new donors who both had great counts.

All of a sudden we find ourselves at a huge crossroads. Multiple crossroads. Have you ever seen a spaghetti-junction? (google image search that absurdness). That is us, right now. 
Yesterday we got the disappointing news of our negative beta for our 5th try at IUI with donor sperm. In the same communication, we also received the news that our RE is now going into research, and we were assigned to a new resident trainee at the clinic. We also got the go ahead that the next step should be IVF w/ ICSI.</p>

<p>Our 5 tries at IUI history is as such: 4 failed IUIs, 1 success ending in trisomy 20. Cycles have been medicated from everything from clomid, to letrozole, HCG trigger, to Ovidrel. My average was typically 2 follicles per medicated IUI, but with clomid I over-responded. I have a low AMH for my age (about the average for someone 10 years older than myself), but a seemingly very high AFC. These results have been labeled &quot;incongruent&quot; and a suggested diagnosis of DOR has been addressed. With the cost of donor sperm being as it is, we are at this point ready to call it quits with the IUIs. I am mentally ready to do my funded attempt at IVF. </p>

<p>Realistically, this will probably be our last ditch effort. I don&#39;t think I could fathom the cost of an additional unfunded cycle. I have a lot of anxiety re: spending money, and even unloading the money we have into 5 failed attempts has been hard for me to deal with. </p>

<p>Cross-roads questions:</p>

<p>1)I am really uncomfortable with being assigned to a trainee RE for my one shot at IVF. I think I would like to look into transferring to a satellite of the clinic which is closer to my new work. In doing this, I would also get to switch out of this new trainee&#39;s caseload and onto a much more experienced RE. The only downside to this is potentially having a longer wait time for my funded cycle. Opinions?</p>

<p>2) We had some shitty luck with donors during the IUI process. Our first donor was someone we really both loved. We bought 3 vials from him to start. It quickly became apparent after two cycles that his numbers just sucked. 5 million, and 2.5 million were post-double-wash counts (our clinic has a mandatory wash policy on even pre-washed vials). We decided to forgo using the 3rd vial and instead did the subsequent 3 IUIs with 2 new donors who both had great counts. In your opinion, with IVF w/ ICSI, would you go back to using that 3rd vial from donor #1? I unfortunately don&#39;t remember his motility/morphology but presumably after 2 washes those low numbers were likely whatever was still good. Or would you instead choose to toss that remaining vial and spend another $1k on a new vial from one of these new donors? </p>

I guess because I've had a couple of years to deal with my infertility issues it isn't hitting me as hard as my wife - we are always upset when a transfer doesn't work, but this one has been especially rough on her.

Is there anything else I can do to help her get through this as a husband?

They want me to trigger today with 10 follicles of good size. In my last three cycles I had 25 follicles (antagonist cycle), 16 follicles (down-reg) and 15 follicles (down-reg). From those I got 1 PGS normal embryo each.

**The important part**
I really messed up this cycle and missed a  few doses of Menopur at the beginning, plus there were some other oddities with not going on the pill and then having to down-regulate with Synarel for a lot longer. 

**Pros**
* If I cancel before Egg collection, I’m out a cancellation fee of $500 (plus $500-ish for meds) vs $7500 for a full cycle
* I’d probably be able to start a new stim cycle as soon as my period arrives (need to check).
* I feel there are good explanations to why I’m getting a poorer response this time than usual.

<p>They want me to trigger today with 10 follicles of good size. In my last three cycles I had 25 follicles (antagonist cycle), 16 follicles (down-reg) and 15 follicles (down-reg). From those I got 1 PGS normal embryo each.</p>

<p><strong>The important part</strong>
I really messed up this cycle and missed a  few doses of Menopur at the beginning, plus there were some other oddities with not going on the pill and then having to down-regulate with Synarel for a lot longer. </p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>
* If I cancel before Egg collection, I’m out a cancellation fee of $500 (plus $500-ish for meds) vs $7500 for a full cycle
* I’d probably be able to start a new stim cycle as soon as my period arrives (need to check).
* I feel there are good explanations to why I’m getting a poorer response this time than usual.</p>

Silicon Valley-I find this show really funny. I love Gabe from the office. 

TLC show 3 wives one husband-mention of multiple miscarriages. 

Married At First Sight-really confused by this season, next week looks crazy!

Mary Kills People-Really enjoy this, the plot line is interesting, and no triggers. 

UnReal-good drama and no triggers this season. 

Suits-I really don't get the plot of this show anymore, but no triggers. I don't understand how Donna gets super promoted, and Harvey is dating his ex-therapist, also how will Meghan Markle leave?! So I keep watching to find out. 

Grey's Anatomy-I'm super bummed that April and Arizona are leaving the show. Excited to see if Meredith will start dating a potential love interest that was mentioned in the previous episode last week.

I just got back from being diagnosed with gingivitis for the first time. It turns out that Progesterone and Estrogen can exacerbate existing gum problems, and if you've got them already, you're probably going to have sore, tender, bleedy gums when you're doing an FET. 

So, my tips:

* be really good about flossing and brushing leading into any treatment protocols. The fewer issues you have now, the less bad they'll get once you're shooting hormones into your body.

* get your xrays updated before you do a transfer! (I haven't done this, and was due for an xray today. If the transfer failed, I go back in next week for new xrays)

* get a water pick, and/or swish warm salt water around in your mouth if your gums are tender. 

* If you've got any cavities or other pending problems that your dentist is keeping an eye on, ask if they'd be willing to do them when you are pregnant, or if you should just do them sooner, because when treatment works, you might end up having to get a cavity filled without anesthetic (because apparently some dentists are sadists)

* If you get diagnosed with hormone-related ""pregnancy gingivitis"" during an FET cycle, don't feel bad about yourself, it's not actually preventable, just survivable.

I went from hopeful and optimistic about this cycle and our situation to a total mess. They're a few years younger than us. She had her IUD removed right around the time my first transfer failed in December - which means her first month ever trying simply worked. I crumbled and completely took it out on my husband, who is hurting just as badly as I am, and is my rock and deserved so much more in that moment. I woke him up at five in the morning, unable to sleep, to apologize, so maybe we could start today back to where we were last night - at the very least knowing how much we have each other through it all. 

I'm happy for our friends; it's how it should be for all of us. But as it turns out, life doesn't work that way, and I'm still feeling vulnerable and sad and I wish I could just flashback to earlier last night and hold on to that feeling of hope and optimism. 

Fingers crossed today's FET is our turning point.

I couldn't say ""another asshole friend who doesn't get how hard this has been!"" and mask my sadness with bitterness or anger.

plus size 29 yr old dealing with infertility and early loss for 3 years this week.

started my first cycle of medicated IUI recently, I'm on metformin, iron supplement, baby aspirin and just finished a round of letrizole last Friday. 

My first follicle scan was yesterday and there was only one follicle at 11mm, my doc wants it to be 18 before moving forward with ovidrel and IUI. I have another scan tomorrow, but how fast does a follicle grow?

thing is we are going to use donor sperm this time around and it needs to be shipped to my doctors office in a tank and the doctor isn't able to store it. So I ordered the vile yesterday to be delivered tomorrow morning in a tank that would last until monday. I couldn't wait to order for after tomorrow's scan because shipping doesn't always cooperate over the weekend and there's no one at the office to recieve it anyway. 

now I'm all nervous and feel way to pressured to grow a follicle nice and fat in a short amount of time. 

How fast does a follicle grow? Could it Peter out and not ever get to 18mm? what if I ovulate early and we miss It?

Yesterday we had our wtf-meeting with the hospital in Belgium. We did 4 cycles in the Netherlands and now one at Belgium. Even though we had 18 eggs only 10 were mature and only 4 fertilised. And only one made it till day 5 (partial blast). Because of those numbers and my low AMH (below 1) they suspect I have bad egg-quality and they suggested we use donor eggs. They also suggested to tes me for Fragile-X and to do some genetic screening, so we might just do that even though it won’t change anything they think it will help in the process.
I am absolutely devastated! This is the worst news possible for me. I am an only child and ever since I was little I dreamed about having my own kids. The past few years I have been slowly adapting to just one kid, but now I guess it means no kids.
In the Netherlands it is not allowed to do anonymous egg donations so the only situations where it would work is if you have your own donor. Besides me not really being comfortable with it, it is just not something you can ask.. in Belgium they do have donors, but they are not available for Dutch people.

We started seeking help almost a year ago now and I diagnosed my husband with retrograde ejaculation (basically due to a surgery as an infant, semen goes into his bladder instead of coming out) so conceiving naturally is literally impossible due to the lack of sperm.

After a shit-ton of bloodwork (I think totaling like 25 vials just for me), we had our consult with Dr. Trobough of the Alan Beer Institute today. We learned that I have several immune factors that are likely preventing implantation by attacking the embryo. I don't remember what they are because JESUS it was like listening to an hour-long biochem lecture. 

Because of these immune factors, he recommended the following:

1. one round of LIT (leukocyte immunization therapy), followed by retesting and a possible second round of LIT. This is not approved in the US so we would have to travel to Tucson and then go to the center that does it across the border in Mexico.

If my results are still bad after 2 rounds, I will do a month of Humira and IVIG treatment.

2. Lovenox injections on day 6 of FET cycle.

3. Prednisone starting before FET and continuing through first trimester if successful. Likely IVIG treatment at time of transfer as well. 

I'm so fucking overwhelmed by all this. The timing of all this means we won't be able to do an FET until August, and they strongly recommend not trying naturally in the meantime because it can lead to miscarriage as you go through the treatments.

Just got a call that 2 of my 6 embryos made it to Day 5 blastocyst stage. The nurse said that there may be more but only 2 at Day 5, and that I would get a call tomorrow with a report if any more made it to blastocyst.
My question is - how many days do they give to see if an embryo reaches blastocyst stage? I have read anywhere between 5-8 days. Is there a point where it just stops dividing?

2nd question is - she said that they will do the biopsy on the 2 so far to look for chromosomal abnormalities, which I am nervous about due to my age. She said it would take up to 2 weeks for that to be completed. Is that normal? The impression I got was that it would take 2 weeks then they would set up the transfer date. At what point do they put you on meds pre-transfer?

It does look like it is possible to import eggs into US, but looks very complex, costly and time consuming. Also I am wary of the few egg/embryo couriers available...I cannot afford the risk of something going wrong during transportation.

319,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"**What is Unexplained Infertility?**


Unexplained Infertility is a diagnosis given after a patient has been trying to get pregnant for one year (12 months) and has been unable to. For women trying to get pregnant from 20-35, the one year mark is usually when it is recommended to seek treatment if pregnancy has not been achieved. For women age 35 and older, the timeline is 6 months.
Equally, you can also be diagnosed with unexplained infertility after 4-6 failed IUI cycles, if you are trying to conceive with frozen or donor sperm and don’t have the option of having sex to try to get pregnant.
Unexplained Infertility is a diagnosis given after standard medical investigations have failed to find anything abnormal. (These tests include - semen analysis, checking fallopian tubes to make sure they are not blocked, and confirming that a woman is ovulating)
Unexplained Infertility affects 25% (or 1 in 4) of infertile couples.
Unexplained Infertility is a diagnosis that can be applied to women who’ve been pregnant before, and those who have not. This can include previous pregnancies that have resulted in miscarriage, stillbirth, live birth. 

**Tests you will likely have done to determine you are Unexplained Infertility**


To be diagnosed with Unexplained Infertility, several tests will be conducted on you and your partner to determine if there is a hormonal, structural or other health concern that is causing you not to become pregnant. 


**Semen analysis** - In a nutshell, is there sperm and is there enough of the right quality? (Better explanations are provided in the FAQ!)


**Hysterosalpingogram** (Or HSG because that’s one hell of a long word) - This is test to determine whether your fallopian tubes are clear. If they are not, if they are blocked, then that is a reason why pregnancy may not have occured. If they are clear, it is determined to be “normal”. (Again, better explanations are provided in the FAQ)

**Hysteroscopy** - This is a test where the uterus itself is investigated. Are there polyps, a septum, fibroids or perhaps a bicornuate or other unexpected shape to the uterus present?


**Ovulation** - Is the woman ovulating? Clinics may confirm this in a variety of ways - women with regular cycles who’ve been recording basal body temperatures and charting them may be as much proof as an RE needs. (Please chime in on how your RE confirmed you ovulated!)


**Blood work** - Ideally, your AMH levels (Anti-Mullerian Hormone) should be checked at this stage, to make sure that you do not have diminishing ovarian reserve.
Other blood work may be ordered - This could included markers for celiacs disease, thyroid hormone checks, iron levels, etc. It seems to vary by practitioner what will or won’t be ordered. 


**Primary vrs Secondary Infertility**


**What is Primary infertility?**

Primary infertility refers to a woman who has not been pregnant at all. This means no chemical, no miscarriage, no stillbirth, no livebirth. This is not a hugely important difference, but it comes up from time to time in scholarly literature. Thus, a woman who has been trying for a year, never had a positive pregnancy test, with “normal” test results would be given the diagnosis of “Primary Unexplained Infertility”.


**What is Secondary infertility?**


Secondary infertility refers to women who have been pregnant before, but are now unable to get pregnant in the expected 1 year. What “counts” when we say pregnant before? 
Chemical pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and livebirths. You can be a childless woman but be diagnosed with secondary unexplained infertility if your medical history includes several miscarriages. 


Added bonus - You know how you’re discussing your really depressing fertility history with a health care provider, and all of a sudden they light up when you mention you had a miscarriage? And then they say something like “Oh! So you’ve been pregnant before! That’s great!” and smile like somehow the miscarriage was a happy occasion that all should rejoice over?
Turns out that statistically, having been pregnant before increases your odds of getting pregnant again by 1.8 times. (You are 1.8 times more likely to get pregnant again)
However, miscarriages are still super depressing, and this statistic doesn’t change that. :/


**So now that I have this diagnosis, what should I do?**


**Expectant Management**

Have sex. I know that no one wants to hear that after a year of optimistic rose-coloured lensed love making, followed by timed intercourse, followed by designated fucking days, followed by despair driven forced sex as dictated by some stupid app on your phone… but the science seems to indicate that long term, most folks with Primary or Secondary unexplained infertility are likely to get pregnant without any help. Seriously! 

Here are some papers to back me up:


(NB: Scientists refer to have sex to get pregnant as “Expectant Management”, which is nowhere near as descriptive as “Fucking with purpose” or “trying for a free sex baby”, but I suppose we can forgive them)


[Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial (2008) ](https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a716)
“In couples with Unexplained Infertility existing treatments such as empirical clomifene and unstimulated intrauterine insemination are unlikely to offer superior live birth rates compared with expectant management.”



[Unexplained infertility: overall ongoing pregnancy rate and mode of conception](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/26/2/360/595834)

“Overall success rate in couples with unexplained infertility is high. Most pregnancies are conceived spontaneously. We recommend that if the pregnancy prognosis is good, expectant management should be suggested.” 

**Exceptions to the just go have sex approach**

If you are age 35 or older, have diminishing ovarian reserves, or have some other reason why time is very much of the essence, expectant management may not be recommended. This is definitely going to be something your doctor discusses with you, to find the optimal route for you and your fertility. 


**But I’m so tired of just having sex…** 

Yes. I am deeply sympathetic to this, and I hear you. 
By the time you get a unexplained infertility diagnosis it seems like you’ve been waiting forever. Finally you get an appointment with an RE, a fertility clinic, someone who’s going to run tests and figure out why things aren’t going the way they were supposed to. You get your hopes up, this all feels like steps forward! Finally!
The tests come back, the answers are all positive, and then you’re told to just go back to doing that thing that hasn’t worked yet. 
It’s very discouraging. It’s hard to feel good about that.

Turns out that’s pretty normal. 

From the [Clomifene Study](https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a716)
“More women randomised to clomifene citrate (94%) and unstimulated intrauterine insemination (96%) found the process of treatment acceptable than those randomised to expectant management (80%).

The [Hunault prediction model](https://www.freya.nl/probability.php) helps me feel more optimistic about our longterm chances.


**What if I don’t care about all those studies and want to pursue some sort of treatment anyway?**

Well I for one am not going to tell you how to live your life! 
The best caution against pursuing IUI, IVF or drugs is probably cost. Maybe IUI is covered for you. Maybe the benefit of doing something is more valuable to you than the cost. These are all individual decisions that you will have to make.

<p><strong>Primary vrs Secondary Infertility</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is Primary infertility?</strong></p>

<p>Primary infertility refers to a woman who has not been pregnant at all. This means no chemical, no miscarriage, no stillbirth, no livebirth. This is not a hugely important difference, but it comes up from time to time in scholarly literature. Thus, a woman who has been trying for a year, never had a positive pregnancy test, with “normal” test results would be given the diagnosis of “Primary Unexplained Infertility”.</p>

<p><strong>What is Secondary infertility?</strong></p>

<p>Secondary infertility refers to women who have been pregnant before, but are now unable to get pregnant in the expected 1 year. What “counts” when we say pregnant before? 
Chemical pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and livebirths. You can be a childless woman but be diagnosed with secondary unexplained infertility if your medical history includes several miscarriages. </p>

<p>Added bonus - You know how you’re discussing your really depressing fertility history with a health care provider, and all of a sudden they light up when you mention you had a miscarriage? And then they say something like “Oh! So you’ve been pregnant before! That’s great!” and smile like somehow the miscarriage was a happy occasion that all should rejoice over?
Turns out that statistically, having been pregnant before increases your odds of getting pregnant again by 1.8 times. (You are 1.8 times more likely to get pregnant again)
However, miscarriages are still super depressing, and this statistic doesn’t change that. :/</p>

<p><strong>So now that I have this diagnosis, what should I do?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Expectant Management</strong></p>

<p>Have sex. I know that no one wants to hear that after a year of optimistic rose-coloured lensed love making, followed by timed intercourse, followed by designated fucking days, followed by despair driven forced sex as dictated by some stupid app on your phone… but the science seems to indicate that long term, most folks with Primary or Secondary unexplained infertility are likely to get pregnant without any help. Seriously! </p>

<p>Here are some papers to back me up:</p>

<p>(NB: Scientists refer to have sex to get pregnant as “Expectant Management”, which is nowhere near as descriptive as “Fucking with purpose” or “trying for a free sex baby”, but I suppose we can forgive them)</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a716"">Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial (2008) </a>
“In couples with Unexplained Infertility existing treatments such as empirical clomifene and unstimulated intrauterine insemination are unlikely to offer superior live birth rates compared with expectant management.”</p>

<p><a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/26/2/360/595834"">Unexplained infertility: overall ongoing pregnancy rate and mode of conception</a></p>

<p>“Overall success rate in couples with unexplained infertility is high. Most pregnancies are conceived spontaneously. We recommend that if the pregnancy prognosis is good, expectant management should be suggested.” </p>

<p><strong>Exceptions to the just go have sex approach</strong></p>

<p>If you are age 35 or older, have diminishing ovarian reserves, or have some other reason why time is very much of the essence, expectant management may not be recommended. This is definitely going to be something your doctor discusses with you, to find the optimal route for you and your fertility. </p>

<p><strong>But I’m so tired of just having sex…</strong> </p>

<p>Yes. I am deeply sympathetic to this, and I hear you. 
By the time you get a unexplained infertility diagnosis it seems like you’ve been waiting forever. Finally you get an appointment with an RE, a fertility clinic, someone who’s going to run tests and figure out why things aren’t going the way they were supposed to. You get your hopes up, this all feels like steps forward! Finally!
The tests come back, the answers are all positive, and then you’re told to just go back to doing that thing that hasn’t worked yet. 
It’s very discouraging. It’s hard to feel good about that.</p>

<p>Turns out that’s pretty normal. </p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a716"">Clomifene Study</a>
“More women randomised to clomifene citrate (94%) and unstimulated intrauterine insemination (96%) found the process of treatment acceptable than those randomised to expectant management (80%).</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.freya.nl/probability.php"">Hunault prediction model</a> helps me feel more optimistic about our longterm chances.</p>

<p><strong>What if I don’t care about all those studies and want to pursue some sort of treatment anyway?</strong></p>

<p>Well I for one am not going to tell you how to live your life! 
The best caution against pursuing IUI, IVF or drugs is probably cost. Maybe IUI is covered for you. Maybe the benefit of doing something is more valuable to you than the cost. These are all individual decisions that you will have to make. </p>

<p>Study that discusses this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/30/1/71/682326"">Overtreatment in couples with Unexplained Infertility</a></p>
