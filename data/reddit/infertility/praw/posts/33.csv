So I know I'm dumb but I just now figured out what you guys mean whenever ppl talk about different states offering different IF Insurances: That state law (in 15 states) requires carriers to offer certain minimum IF benefits. I kept thinking you guys meant ACA, but now I see it means any company that operates out of that state. A real a-ha moment for me.

So I was reading the list on the RESOLVE site and wasn't entirely sure how to interpret. Some are straightforward and some aren't. So I hoped y'all could help.

I just was laid off my job in my home of KY (I had just finished maxing out the $15k lifelong IF benefit that was offered, so silver lining?) and am thinking of looking for a job in and moving to Illinois in order to get better coverage and not put our family in the hole before we even get started. I'm 31, DOR and have already had 1 failed IUI and 1 failed IVF with no leftover embryos (nothing to transfer) so while I'm not there yet, If I'm looking at uprooting my whole existence, donor eggs may be an eventuality for us. I know MA requires insurance to cover donor eggs and also has no lifetime max, but I can't understand IL.

Have any of you out there moved for IF purposes? Are there any other states that pay for donor eggs? What about drugs? What else should I consider?  Also, I'm going to pitch this to my husband as a temporary move that could help us start a family. Thinking a two year time limit. Is that logical?

Several years ago, I had a Mirena IUD put in. From the minute it was inserted, it felt like someone was squeezing my uterus. The cramps were so painful that I was doubled over, and pain shot down the back of my left leg. Though the pain of the cramps lessened somewhat, they never went away (nor did the shooting pain) and I bled for 5 months straight until the doctor removed the IUD. I instantly felt better. 

We've been trying to conceive for a year, and I've had 3 chemical pregnancies. (Well, 2 confirmed, 1 suspected). Other friends who've had chemical pregnancies say they just felt like heavy periods. But for me, I am always doubled over in pain and for 1 to 1.5 days bleed incredibly heavily, then the bleeding slows to light spotting for another 6 days. During the last one, I was bleeding through 1 super plus tampon every 10-15 minutes.

In fact, when the first one happened, I hadn't taken a pregnancy test and I actually went to the hospital because I thought that something was terribly wrong. We'd been on vacation, so by the time we got to the hospital it was day 2 and the bleeding was slowing. A urine pregnancy test didn't show anything, so they told me I just had my period and sent me on my way. 

It wasn't until then next cycle when I got a positive test at 10 DPO and started bleeding a few hours later in the exact same manner that I realized the first was probably a chemical pregnancy too. A few months later, the exact same thing happened again.

Hey ladies!
 So I had my first appointment with an RE. I was diagnosed in August with pcos, and it never felt right to me. I was really sick on metformin for 4 months, finally decided enough was enough after a check up with my obgyn, and she gave me really conflicting advice. 

Well the RE said I do not have Pcos. I'm ovulating on my own and there's  no reason for me to track with opks or temp. She checked my ovaries and they both looked good, about 10 follicles on each, I just happened to be 8 days post ovulating, and there was a corpus luteum (or a cyst if I wasn't where I thought I was in my cycle) on my right ovary. 

That puts us back into unexplained infertility territory, she said she suspects maybe I have endometriosis due to some symptoms (spotting before my period, cramping during sex), but she wasn't 100% on that.

Basically she said there's not much more anyone can do until we go for an IUI or IVF. Since I'm ovulating on my own, a monitored cycle on clomid would be pointless. So here we are. we're going to start saving probably for a year and do IUI. This clinic is 875 a cycle, which is reasonable, but not for us. We're both freelance artists (husband runs a Youtube channel, and I'm a photographer) so it's going to take a while to get the money, but that's the next step. I have 3 sets of 30 wondofs OPK I'd like to give to 3 different ladies. First come first serve.

RE is worried because my AMH is dropping.  It's not low, but it's going down (3.88 at last check, and FSH is around 11 - US measurements), and my endometriosis is growing rapidly.  RE is worried that things are going to get worse and worse and it won't be long until it's just that much harder to get viable embryos.  At this point, my left ovary barely produces at all, and what it does produce is very hard to get through the large endometrioma on it.  She also thinks that another lap to remove it will cause more harm than it could possibly do good.  We have 4 embryos on ice right now (after retrieving 21 over 2 cycles - no transfers).  The drop off rate is just so high.

So here's the plan.  We're going to take a cycle off to regroup, and not have to stim or retrieve during Christmas or New Years.  Maybe then my body will start to sort itself out.  I'll be on birth control to contain the endo as much as possible.  After that, we'll do another retrieval with a similar protocol as last time.

They're going to keep watching them, but they're probably out.

The plan for this round was a fresh day 3 transfer since we have a history of not making it blast. Our RE gave us the option of transferring 2 or 3. She said normally, she'd only do 2, but because of the endo and having had a failed cycle, she'd do 3 if we were okay with twins. I laughed, what DOR gal gets to have twins?! Since we had a total of 4, my husband and I decided to transfer just 2 of the 8-cell embryos and the other 2 will be frozen this afternoon. We thought, this way, if this transfer doesn't work, we can transfer 2 next month? Does that make sense? I was so unsure, and we had to decide right away. Originally, I was thinking we'd transfer all of them, but I was thinking I'd only get 2 or 3 on day 3. I just don't know if that was the right move. Too late now.

The procedure was okay. My vaginal canal is still pretty sore from the retrieval, so the speculum was not my friend, but it was okay. Although, I did feel really exposed in the leg holders with my bits pointing up, a big bright light shining on me and the window to the lab pointing right at my spread legs. However, everyone (all females minus my husband) was so amazing and kind and sweet. One of the Drs in the room is very pregnant, so that was not fun to be around during my transfer, but what do you do if you're a woman in that field? She has a right to be pregnant. It just sucked to be around her during such a vulnerable time in my infertility. But, it was really, really neat to see the little air bubbles float into my uterus and to see the pictures of our embryos. I cried. The RE and the embryologist said the embryos looked really good at 5% and 10% fragmentation and 8 cells. So, here's hoping/praying/bargaining/all of that.

We went to get lunch after, and at the table next to us, someone made an announcement about how his wife and he are having a boy. Ugh, everyone started gushing and I started crying (again). But, I'm home now, and we're both off the rest of the day. We're going to watch movies on the couch. First beta is on the 14th.

My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 10 months now with no luck. Timing is pretty much a non-issue (I've been charting and we've been hitting 1-2 of the best days each month for 9/10 months - and the other month he wasn't in the same state during O-time), but there are factors on both sides that *could* cause problems (I may have scarring from a past D&C or from a somewhat traumatic IUD removal; he has diabetes which, though well-managed, could impair fertility). We've got our first RE appointment scheduled for late January, when it'll officially have been 1 year since we started trying, but this week we have check-ins with our regular docs to see if there's anything we can identify or rule out while we're getting the referral we need for the RE. I'll note that when I did a pre-conception checkup in January before getting my IUD removed, the GYN said everything seemed normal.

So. If you could go back in time to your last visit pre-RE, what would you have wanted to ask? When I was making the appointment, I tried to get some insight into what (if anything) they could start evaluating, but was basically just told ""you'll just have to come in for a consult."" as if that's all they could say over the phone.

They used that cycle to check my tubes (clear) and if I ovulated (I didn't).

So my latest appointment I got in and the doctor basically just handed me a prescription for more provera and also clomid, explained when to take it and that was it. He didn't order any blood tests to see if I ovulate, though I suppose if I don't I'll have no period.

But he didn't tell me when exactly I'll ovulate. It's been 3 years since I've had a cycle, honestly I can't remember what my cycle is normally like. I don't know of clomid makes you ovulate around d14 like normal?

I don't want to stress myself out getting ovulation test strips to check, but is sex every other day between d12 and d20 likely to cover the ovulation timeframe? I read not to have it every day otherwise the sperm will be immature and not able to reach the egg.

I'm pretty pissed off with the appointment tbh. It was a different doctor to last time and he seemed to just want me out of the room as soon as possible. The nurse who was in the appointment did tell me afterwards to expect bloating and extreme pms. Did that happen for you if you took it?

Anyway, fast forward a little bit and suddenly where I didn't have a regular period each month, I started getting them. Which was totally fine with me, ya know whatever. 

So fast forward again, to two weeks ago when I came down being SUPER sick. The doctor deemed it was pneumonia, but after not getting better after a heavy round of meds, he wasn't so sure, but ended up sticking with his original diagnosis. I figured I was going to skip my period in November, since I got sick right around the time it would have came. You know stress and blah blah all that fun stuff. My period came on the 28th of Novemeber, and i had one day of heavy flow, then one day of very light flow and then nothing. 

This is very odd for me, I flow super heavy for at least 4 days, then light flow for the next 3-4 days, until it finally comes to a stop.

From what I'm looking at online this is not great?

My SO and I did our first round of IVF in October. I had 9 mature eggs and 5 fertilized using ICSI. We had 3 make it to day 5, a 2BB and 2 morulas. They transferred the blast and a morula which lead to a short pregnancy (8 weeks) when we discovered the embryo didn't develop past 6 weeks. A medical miscarriage happened last week. I'm still dealing with some spotting and my HCG was still over 2,000 this last Monday. I go for a repeat HCG mid next week.

The last morula made it to day 6 and was frozen as a 4BB. I'm nervous that our embryos aren't good quality. Are the success rates for day 6 transfers just as good as day 5? It makes me nervous that they were all so far behind where they should be on day 5. 

My RE doesn't do your AMH unless she suspects issues so I don't know that number. All my other tests came back normal.

<p>I was wondering if anyone had anymore information or experience with this. </p>

<p>This month we are doing medicated IUI (clomid, maybe some injections, trigger shot, then insemination)</p>

<p>Edit: i can&#39;t thank everyone enough. I&#39;m definitely making a LONG list of things to bring up and discuss at my next appointment. </p>

Since then I've been inching my way through this whole process since January with our RE including multiple failed IUI's, hysteroscopy, IVF retrieval, etc. with no real diagnosis. We were gearing up for our first FET next week and just found out it is likely being canceled due to fluid in the lining. This is probably the 4th time during one of my various cycles there has been fluid. One of the first times resulted in the hysteroscopy to remove polyps. Other times it has happened it hasn't been as much of an issue since what we were doing wasn't dependent on the lining, but now it is problem. 

Has anyone dealt with fluid in the lining? I'm somewhat frustrated that my RE doesn't have any plan for how we should deal with it. We've seen it happen now multiple times, and yet there was no concern or plan about it as we went into this FET cycle even though I brought it up. I am concerned this may have to do something with scarring I have in the area but I don't know since we kept ignoring it when it wasn't getting in the way.

104,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, guys:

I've been a bit absent this week.  Since so many of you have checked in on me and were watching the Mr. Feetos saga, I thought I'd give you a quick update.  Sorry if this is the wrong place, but this is sort of a novel and seemed excessive for the daily thread.

It's been a rough week.  After his trip to Urgent Care on Monday [and the morbidly hilarious trip into the house](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5fhvfv/tuesday_off_topic_thread/dakds96/), his pain was not getting any better, but on Tuesday he was able to walk with help and his cane to get to the bathroom and back to his recliner.  

Over night, though, things took a turn for the worse.  He wet himself (completely - probably twice) over night, and he couldn't walk in the morning.  He was very confused and had trouble focusing his eyes.  I couldn't move him, so I called 911 and had him taken by ambulance to the ER.  They determined that one of the meds that Urgent Care had given him was VERY VERY BAD to take with one of his daily scripts.  (They had his meds list when they prescribed it, so I'm a bit on the pissed side.)  The ER doc said we were lucky we stopped the meds when we did, because that combination can cause coma or death.

The ER ran a CT on his hip and determined that there was no bone/tendon issue there, so it was likely just a compacted muscle on the nerve.  Because of that, they couldn't hold him or admit him.  They gave him some new scripts and a stronger steroid.  Then **they released him BEFORE HE COULD WALK**, so we had to have him sent by ambulance back home.  Still wearing pee pants.  I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown trying to figure out what I was going to do with a 260 pound man covered in urine who couldn't walk or stand.

Thank God for the Paramedics who brought us home.  They were very clear that they were going to stay and help me get him cleaned up and into the house, and that I didn't need to worry.  They would help me however they could, and wouldn't leave until he was clean and stable.

Since he didn't take his meds that morning, we were lucky that by the time the whole ordeal was done and we got home, much of the previous medication had worked its way out of his system.  He was able to stand briefly so I could get him cleaned up and changed into clean clothes and an adult diaper (don't ask why we had those suckers in the house already).  I called my Father in Law to take his scripts to the Pharmacy and buy a urinal in case he was going to be stuck in the recliner for a few days.

Today, the pain in his leg is much, much lighter.  But through the course of the week at some point he pulled his pectoral muscle badly while trying to hold himself up, and that's causing him a great deal of pain.  Poor guy couldn't catch a fucking break if it hit him in the face.

We have a referral to an orthopedic doc to do a different type of scan of the affected area on his leg, but are trying to get that care transferred to the VA, since that's where his PCP is and all tests are covered 100% there.  

I'm okay now.  I got a couple good nights of sleep, and he's feeling much better.  I'm all of a sudden VERY grateful that I got benched this month.  This cycle would have been scrapped anyway, and this way I didn't have to spend any money.

Now to just figure out how to get the VA to cover the ambulance and ER charges...

Thanks for the love!

21, M.

183 cm height

90.1 Kg weight

Caucasian

DOC: 1.5 weeks with 2 weeks of break in between, resumed today. 

Location: Genital area, mostly around the scrotum/testes

No other medical issues

Current Meds: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen 

Issue: Ok, this is going to be long. But I am going to make it brief. Ask and I shall elaborate. 

**1)** Happened once, 6 months ago. Came out of nowhere. Lasted 6 days. Started with peeing feeling. 2 days later, pain started around scrotum, but not the balls themselves. Visited 3 different doctors in 2 different locations and did the following tests:

- STI tests x4 = Negative

- Prostate exam = negative

2nd doctor suspected bacteria; put me on macrobid. Didn't work. Became well on 6th day solely by painkillers. Masturbated twice and everything was working fine. No blood in urine or semen. No weird smell from Urine or semen. If it is not in the symptoms list below, it did not happen. 

Pain scale: 7. I could barely function for the entirety of the incident. 

The whole first experience was out of the blue. No traces of causes and when it left, it didn't leave any traces. For 6 months after this first time, EVERYTHING WENT BACK TO NORMAL! 



**2)** 2nd time it happened, 2 weeks ago. Lasted 1.5 weeks. Masturbated twice and each time I did, it got a bit worse. Yet again 3 different doctors (yes, again. Completely different) with following tests:

- STI tests x3 = negative

- No prostate exam

- An Ultrasound of scrotum/testes = nothing found. Currently waiting for Urologist appointment. 

No antibiotics prescribed. Doctor's suspicion: Torsion, prostatitis, STI, inflammation. 

My self diagnosis: Male dyspareunia, Inflammation, prostatitis, a UTI that got there somehow. 

Pain scale: 4-7 varying throughout the day. 

**Self-treatment:**

- Lots of water (calms the pain down)

- Less sitting

- More exercising

- Walking

- showering

- Lying down

- Pain killers mentioned above

- Trying not to masturbate

- Massage of the scrotum or pulling the scrotum hard

**Symptoms**

- Lower back pain

- Constant pain in the scrotum and shaft

- Feeling that you need to pee (even after peeing)

- Instantaneous sharp *shock* pain in the scrotum or shaft (only happened in 2nd time). Shock because it leaves me startled for a while. There is no pattern to expect it. 

- Couldn't sit on your bum for too long because of genital pain

- Feeling that my scrotum or shaft having a muscle spasm

- pain at the tip of penis when peeing sometimes

- Pain killers did not respond sometimes even when I have Naproxen

**Professional Diagnosis**

- Nothing found. NOTHING. 

- Ultrasound results showed nothing but small testicle size than normal 

- Waiting to speak to Urologist

- no hernia

**Things to know about me**

- I never smoked anything in my life

- I don't drink alcohol

- NEVER. HAD. SEX.

- family history of kidney stones

- No history of depression and anxiety 

- masturbate at least 4 times a week. 

****

**UPDATE**

From the time I first uploaded this post on /r/AskDocs, I have made 2 more visits to the clinic and done some home treatment. Here are the details:

**Doctor visits**

- UTI test  = negative

- prostate exam = nothing 

- no cysts 

- really tender testicles 

- Appointment for 2nd ultrasound (completed)

- Put me on Vimovo and Azythromycin. Why? Because I pushed him to. But I wanted something like Cypro or Bactrim. He suspected it just HAD to do with STD. I did not buy them. Why? Because damned if I do, damned if I don't. If it doesn't work, my money is wasted on stupid meds. If it does work, it proves to him that I had sex with someone and got an STD, which is 100% false. 


**Masturbation**

- It really varies. When I get aroused, there is some pain, 5 or 6. Occasional Mild shock pain. 

- Sometimes, after ejaculation, I feel swell with constant 6 pain. Mild 3 shock pain. 

- Other times after ejac, I feel terrible constant pain and 7 shock pain. Could last hours before it calms down again back to Mild shock pain and what not. 

- I really tend to massage my testicles and stroke my penis gently while bending a bit downwards to reduce chances of retrograde ejac. 

**New Home treatment**

- Hot showers while massaging the scrotum

- Lying down on my belly 

- Lying on my back, bringing my knees up to my chest and staying like that for 20 minutes or so.

This was our first cycle of IUI.

Our doctor wants to do at least 3 rounds of IUI before discussing switching to IVF. My partner is depressed and not managing well without her meds (she is trans), and IUIs are already prohibitively expensive as everything is out of pocket for us. I almost want to just move into IVF - I figure, why waste more time? But $600 per IUI is nothing compared to $15,000 for a first IVF cycle. They have a financing company they work with, but I have also considered approaching my credit union for a line of personal credit or loan to cover it. I don't know which would be better. It all feels totally crazy and I am crazy stressed just thinking about it.

Mostly I am just freaking out and needed to vent before I drive my partner totally crazy. (Too late, probably.)

Can&#39;t even tell my family we have been TTC or that we have issues because they are trans/homophobic. All my friends are getting pregnant like rabbits or something, happy for them but screaming on the inside.</p>

<p>I feel like I should apologize for complaining - I have been lurking here for months and many have it far worse than I do. Best wishes to everyone.</p>

My wife (31F) and I (31M) have just started our first round of IUI treatments. We have unexplained infertility, and our doctor started her on Gonal F, a very low dose. Until now, she has always been fairly regular with her cycles. On Monday, we went in for a CD10 ultrasound, and her follicles were small, 10mm, so they told us to come back in today for another. The biggest was only 12mm today. We now have to come back in on Friday for another ultrasound. Everything is fine and on track according to the doc, but things should have progressed quicker than this with the hormones, or so we thought. 

As a reference, last month, she went for a baseline ultrasound and on CD3, her biggest follicle was 9mm. Today, CD12, it was only 12mm, after taking the hormones. Something doesn't seem to compute for us.

I ended up connecting with her and we are both awaiting a FET in Jan/Feb of next year and we text all the time.

It didn't work. They begin planning to meet..... and reply all. Mention how far along the all are... and reply all.... then the peer leader tried to step in and start a new thread... problem is that she shows up as the group when she replies- so the cycle kept continuing.

also currently though, i feel like complete crap! i can walk, but I resemble a hunched over old lady when i do. i feel WAY better then I did yesterday and was able to return to work today, but I am definitely not ""back to normal"". 


the morning after my trigger when i went in for blood draw, i talked to a nurse who informed me that instead of the suppositories, i was going to have to do PIO because of my overzealous ovaries. i talked with her for a while about OHSS and the risks involved, and she warned me to not be surprised if we went to a freeze all cycle instead of a fresh transfer because of the fact that i was already in pain and my last ultrasound before trigger showed free fluid already building up in my abdomen. i wasn't super happy about this, but figure whats waiting another month at this point, i'm super lucky to have had a good response to stims in the first place so i don't want to push that luck. 


well, here's the issue. that nurse is at the ""main campus"" of my clinic, where i spent a lot of time over thanksgiving weekend since the day before the holiday was when my ovaries decided to ""bloom"" haha. ever since Monday rolled around and I've been dealing with my normal clinic, doctor, and nurses, no one has said one peep about doing a freeze all cycle. in fact, they called me earlier today to let me know my fresh transfer was scheduled for this saturday at 10:30am and to have a moderately full bladder when i come in... 


it's become clear to me at this point that i will have to be the one to bring up cancelling the fresh transfer and going for a freeze all, and i am not sure that i want to do that because i am a crazy person. i have googled all of the things and a lot of info on the web says that the lupron trigger ""completely prevents"" OHSS. Is that true even if you have 59 eggs?? Am I putting myself at extreme risk if I am so lucky as to achieve a pregnancy with my fresh transfer on Saturday?? My clinic hasn't been doing follow up bloods since the retrieval so I am not sure if I ""officially"" qualify as already having OHSS, but I have had many of the symptoms (infrequent/painful urination, tender/bloated abdomen, and I know from the last ultrasound I had a bit of free fluid) and i really don't want to end up in the hospital. btw my doctor and nurses definitely KNOW that i have all of these symptoms, I have spoken with them daily and i definitely have not hidden my symptoms. 

also, there is also a lot of info out there about how ""aggressive luteal phase support"" is necessary to even have a chance at achieving pregnancy when doing the lupron trigger with a fresh transfer. since the night after retrieval I've been doing 1ml of PIO and two estrace tablets a day. is this aggressive enough?


TL;DR have pcos and got 59 eggs from my first round of stims. did a lupron trigger. worried about OHSS but clinic seems to still be gung-ho for a fresh transfer. do I protest and insist on freeze all, or trust their judgement (i really really wanna trust their judgement, but also don't want to end up in the hospital)?",t2_tjb2p,False,,0,False,OHSS and the fresh vs frozen tfr decision,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_5fsips,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1480572126.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>i have PCOS and just completed my first IVF stims, retrieval was Monday morning. i did a lupron trigger, and the day before trigger my Estrogen was about 8,700. my clinic doesn&#39;t measure estrogen the day after trigger, so no clue what it was then, but definitely higher. at retrieval they got 59 freaking eggs!! &amp; we currently have 16 day 2 embryos, so yay! </p>

My husband and I have recently learned that our only option for pregnancy is via IVF.  I have severe endometriosis and hydrosalpinx, which means we have to do egg retrieval (maybe 2x), fertilize and freeze embryos, and then I have to have surgery to remove my tubes along with an endometrioma before we can go forward with IVF.  Luckily we like in NJ which is a mandated fertility coverage state--so we do have a lot of coverage as compared to other areas, which I know is a blessing.  

I just found out that my RE only uses ICSI for fertilizing the eggs because they have better results with it.  Our insurance only covers the ICSI (a 2,500 out of pocket cost each time) if my husband ""fails"" his semenalysis 2x.  When I was discussing this with the financial counselor at the RE I made a joke about wishing I could make him fail, and she cryptically recommended I ""google it"" in order to find ways to beat the test.  So I tried, and have not found anything so far.  Does anyone on here know how to go about this (in a manner that does not even remotely damage my husband)?  Economically the 2,500 in addition to other uncovered costs (cryo, genetic testing etc.) is gonna be rough for us to swing especially over multiple rounds.

Anyone want to chat? 
https://webchat.snoonet.org/infertility

I haven't told my sister and don't want to so here I sit just a few days post ER being inundated by new born photos. 

I've been lurking for a long time getting a lot of support by reading everyone's stories. We are unexplained, with difficulty getting blasts to day 5. We originally started the process as we have a genetic condition we wanted to avoid so naively we came in thinking IVF would somehow be 'easier' for us, however turns out not so much :'(. I've never felt like it would be fair to complain as we are so lucky to get something but I struggle so much sometimes as our numbers drop off a cliff between ER & day 5 (1/3 or less on average), and then we have the testing and the numbers drop again. I feel like in the time we have taken to save to afford IVF and now go through multiple cycles everyone is lapping us. 

Has anyone else had any difficulties with poor blast numbers or large numbers of PGS abnormal numbers? Do you have any advice? Our clinic suggested vitamins after our first round delivered nil blasts for testing but don't seem to have any real idea why it goes so badly.

Would love to chat about anything! Thank you so much for sharing so much of your stories, I have been reading along crying and cheering everyone on and I just wanted to say how much help it has been.

My manager has been very flexible, allowing me to make up time, work from home more than usual, etc to accommodate appointments. He doesn't know what is going on just that I have a medical issue approved for FMLA. 

So everything is fine for the most part... I know this is probably a better deal than most people have in the US... but finding time to make up work for appointments is getting more and more difficult. And the bigger problem is that I feel like I cant mentally focus for a full 40 hr week like I used to. My productivity is suffering big time and it's very unlike me. It is also unlike me to miss/make up time as much as this bc I have never had this many appts before! 

I am exploring the idea of reducing my hours (32 hrs vs 40?) but I am unsure how to approach it. I think this would actually improve my work bc I would be more focused during the time I am here. Not to mention how helpful it would be for my mental health. The problem is that I'm not entirely sure I can afford to reduce my pay proportionally to the hours and I don't even know if my manager and on up would be receptive to the idea. The kicker is that I recently had a meeting where I was asked what they could do - (I can't remember the exact wording but a pay raise was implied). 

Is it unreasonable or inadvisable for me to propose something like this without a reduction in pay - Or with a smaller reduction proportional to the hours - In place of the previously mentioned pay raise? Before I breathe a word of it I want to have a solid plan/proposal. 

I wanted to ask this community specifically to see if anyone has been in a similar position or has any alternative ideas on how to approach it? Maybe there are some good corporate buzzwords to include about how this is actually a good deal for the company (all they care about at the end of the day honestly)?

I de-lurked a month or so ago to comment on /u/MBel312 post about Czech clinics. I figured its time to introduce myself and give an update on our progress toward donor egg ivf.

We’re are late, late 30’s - like, practically 40. We’ve been trying for the last year…so, not long considering our age. As soon as we decided to start trying, I got a 100 day cycle. 

I went to see the OB/GYN on account of the 100 fucking days. I had already been reading this subreddit at that point, so I knew to gladly accept the OB/GYN’s referral to an RE.

A bunch of blood draws later and it was pretty clear what the issue was. My FSH was 33 and AMH was undetectable - so total DOR. Go straight to donor eggs, do not pass go.

This was not as difficult to wrap our heads around as I would have thought. I think I’ve known there’s something wrong for awhile. If we conceived as readily and accidentally as our friends and family, we’d have 8 kids by now.

The price for a fresh donor cycle at our clinic is $30,000. The price for a frozen cycle with 6 donor eggs is $18,500. We could move forward with one cycle with a %40 - %60 percent chance of success…but if we needed a second cycle it would be much much more financially painful/crippling.

We were going to go for the frozen donor cycle when I started coming across forum postings for international clinics. The more I read about the Czech clinics the more I started to think of it as a real option. My husband and I have a background in biology, including ART - so we have a pretty good grasp on the technology and science. The Czech clinics looked more advanced in some ways than our local clinic.

After some research I picked the Gennet clinic, although there were quite a few clinics that were comparable. I first contacted them mid-September, we had a consult with the doctor mid-October, we were matched with a donor mid-November (just a few days ago) and are now scheduled to go to Prague for the transfer in January. I’d be happy to give more details if anyone is interested in the process. The total cost for the procedure is $5000. With flights and AirBnB lodging for 10 days we’re looking at $7500 total. There’s definitely some additional challenges with organizing monitoring stateside and figuring out the meds, but it has been manageable so far.

So after a reading a since deleted ""graduate"" advice post on r/TFAB this morning, I feel like it is time to move on from that subreddit.  Maybe I have become too jaded.

My husband and I are both 26.  I am a night shift nurse, and he works in a STEM field.  We live in the southwestern US.  We started trying in December 2015, so it's been almost a year.  I had a very early miscarriage in May (starting bleeding 1 day after my missed period).  We started some initial fertility testing in October with my women's health nurse practitioner (she works with an ob/gyn and another NP).

So far everything with my husband looks ok-ish I think.  On his first S.A. he had 6% morphology, 29.1 mil count, and 51% motility.  On his second (5 weeks apart) he had 8% morphology,  17.6 count, and 48% motility.  Both S.A.s had increased viscosity.  So everything either seems to either on the low end of normal or high end of abnormal with the WHO criteria.  He is scheduled for a urologist appointment later this week that the NP referred him to just in case.


I was just diagnosed with mild PCOS, which is very frustrating to me.  I had a slightly low BMI, so the NP told me to gain 10-15 lbs before we start fertility drugs because she thinks it will help with fertility.  I've gained a few so far, but it's going fairly slow. I think I usually ovulate according to the temp rise on my charts around day 20, but last month when we did day 21 progesterone, my level was .91.  I kind of figured it would be low because I hadn't gotten a temp. rise till day 25, but it was still disappointing on top of the PCOS diagnosis.


I did the HSG last month.  I did it at the hospital I worked at because my insurance would only cover part of the cost if I did it at the chain of hospitals I work at.  The appointment was a 3 hour wait and there was a couple newborn sitting in the same outpatient procedure lobby for the first hour.  The procedure itself was fine though.


So that's where I'm at so far.  Sorry for the wall of text, It's been an annoying month and I'm just ready to get this year done with.  I'm at a normal BMI now, which is good I guess.  I'm trying to decide if I should stay at my current doctor's office or go to an RE.

I found this sub after reaching my limit with the WeddingBee boards and really appreciate how honest and supportive everyone is here (as well as finding humor in this terrible pit of uncertainty). 

My husband and I have been trying since November 2015. After six months, I began temping and charting which showed early ovulation (CD 11–13) and a long enough luteal phase (14 to 16 days). We started seeing an RE in October, and so far all the tests have come back mostly normal (SA for my husband, AMH, CD 20 progesterone, prolactin, TSH and free T4, HSG – the only potential issues are a TSH of 2.35, although from my research it seems like they won't want to treat this, and a stenosis of the cervix that made it difficult to get the catheter up for the HSG). We have an appointment on Thursday to discuss next steps. 

Here's our quandary: We currently live in Turkey and will be leaving next June. All fertility treatments are out of pocket. But, IVF is much cheaper here – one cycle, excluding meds, is around 3,000 Euros. My RE has already said that if we were unexplained, he would suggest a few IUIs (no more than three) and then IVF. He doesn't support the use of Clomid for women who ovulate on their own, as he said that the research doesn't show that much of a benefit. I asked whether it would be possible to jump straight to IVF, and he said that was up to us, but that it does have a much higher success rate. Since we don't have much time (we're gone for half of December, so we wouldn't start treatment until January), my husband and I have talked about skipping IUIs and bringing in the big guns (with the added benefit that IVF can be diagnostic as well). Obviously it's a personal decision, but has anyone done this? Any thoughts about going straight to IVF as a couple with unexplained infertility? Do you think trying one IUI with injectibles would be worth it, just to see how I respond to them?

If it were up to me, I would follow the guidelines set by the NHS, which is for couples with unexplained infertility to try for two years and then move straight to IVF. But time is not on our side, and wherever we move next, IVF will either not be as good (think southeast Asia) or prohibitively expensive (US). 

Also, are there any questions you think we should ask the RE before jumping into IVF? I'm already a bit concerned about my narrow cervix, as it could make IUIs or IVF more difficult (my HSG was quite painful, and I had a long recovery time, around four days or so). I also would prefer to do ICSI and PGS testing, because if we're going to go for it, we might as well make sure that we're transferring genetically normal embryos (although I'm aware that we might not even get there, i.e. I could be a poor responder to stims, and that even a genetically normal embryo is still no guarantee of implantation). But is this overkill since we have no known problems? I've never had a positive pregnancy test, so no miscarriages.

My daughter was born in Aug 2015 at 24 weeks and 3 days due to cervical incompetence.  I had a classical c-section due to her being breech. Sadly, she passed away 2 weeks later.  I had a transabdominal cerclage placed in January and have been trying to get pregnant since then.  I had an early MC in July but have otherwise not gotten pregnant.  My FSH is high but my amh is in the normal range. The RE is confident that I should be able to get pregnant.  
My progesterone tested lower at 8dpo at 9.2 so I was put on post ovulation progesterone.  We did IUI last cycle and it didn't work.  I had 2 mature follicles.

<p>So my question is this- for a FET, if the lining is good and I can get my estrogen up, should I still transfer? We are planning to do PIO as well. Should I let my crappy follicles stop this cycle? The lining should be the most important thing right? I can&#39;t decide if I&#39;m being bullheaded or just dumb. </p>

Not great, so the change in medication didn't do much (even though he didn't change it to the past protocol that had worked, like I wanted). He thinks we'll probably get 5 at retrieval based on the sizes. So, fuck. 

We are planning on doing day 3 PGS with day 5 transfer, after having had a mc on IVF #2 (and never getting anything past day 5 to freeze). So you generally want 10 or so embryos to biopsy on day 3. We have three day-3's frozen (from IVF #3 and 4 with this guy, no transfer done), so having only 5 retrieved this time would be shitty.

So as I'm changing after the ultrasound, I hear my husband say something like is it even worth bothering to continue the cycle. Then I come out and the RE is now suddenly talking about donor eggs and how that could be much better retrieval numbers. 

Now, I have no known fertility factors, and in my first two IVFs at another clinic, they retrieved 13 and then 15 eggs. That was back in Feb/Mar. We left that clinic because we wanted to do PGS moving forward and the RE wasn't really for it.  Donor eggs have NEVER been mentioned by anyone.  

Now, suddenly with this new guy, I'm getting under 10 eggs at retrieval. (last round was 5). It seems like the left ovary is not responding much at all. No idea as to why. He has also never replicated the exact protocol from the first clinic in feb/march, so who knows if that old protocol would still work. Or maybe my ovaries just said fuck it and can't do what they could 5 or 6 months ago. Who knows? But we are still getting eggs. Problem is not all fertilize.

So suddenly going to donor eggs is a huge fucking jump, no? It really threw me for a loop. And then I asked if with donor sperm, we'd be doing just IUIs, right? and he said yes. And my husband asked if we did IVF with donor sperm, fertilization rate would be better, right? And he said yes. And then later said no. And then said yes. And then said donor eggs with husbands sperms would get us better embryo numbers for PGS. And then said, or we could do my eggs with donor sperm. But he was really pushing the donor egg thing as just an easy solution, just like fucking that. Or keep doing what we are doing with different meds, etc. So basically, no clear answers from him. I feel like he's just trying to find the fastest solution to pregnancy, without accounting for the fact that having to do donor anything is a huge step, and I'd like to avoid that until there's no other option.

Now I'm totally fucking lost. We are going to finish up this cycle because I've spent a bunch on meds already. I might just tell them to go ahead with PGS anyway even if we only have like 7 or 8  because we've already paid for PGS. But I really feel like I'm done with this clinic. I have no fertilization reports from the last 2 cycles from them. Or even receipts. No new bloodwork has been run except for the STD panel, and then estradiol at the end of stimming for one of the cycles. 

What the fuck do I do? Go back to fresh transfers and forget PGS and risk a miscarriage? He said because transfer #1 didn't take, and transfer 2 ended in MC, there's a strong chance the embryos all had genetic problems, hence pushing for PGS. But after the MC, it was discovered I have a clotting issue, so that could account for it. Karyotypes and everything else came back fine for us both.

My past RE said the opposite - the mc was bad luck and just keep trying with fresh transfers.

Now I&#39;m caught between wanting to be as far away from her as possible and feeling I want to be involved because this is the first baby in the family and maybe the last. And she&#39;s my sister and needs me. And maybe being an Aunt is the best I&#39;m going to get so I want to &quot;be there&quot;. We&#39;re going there for Christmas so I have a month to get my shit together. The bloke said we could just not go and go snowboarding instead. </p>

<p>The bloke admitted he&#39;s scared about how i will be if this is it; we never get pregnant and I have to watch her bringing up the child I wanted so badly. I have no idea. </p>

I want kids. I've always wanted kids. 1, 2, 3 - no more than 3 please but kids. Husband is pro-kid, but would prefer just one. Sometimes wavers a bit, but I think that's fairly normal.


History time. My husband and I found out in our late teens that he has Klinefelter's, or XXY chromosomes. He's pretty normal (aside from the fact that he married me, poor sod), except for the low testosterone and sperm count. Some men with this condition have a lot of other symptoms, so I try to count us as being fairly lucky. So at 18 he was told he would ""never have children"" following the karyotype testing. We've found out this year that he might not have been infertile at that time, but 10 or so years of testosterone replacement therapy have fried whatever sperm production he may have had. We're looking at a big 0 sperm, repeated multiple times.


Our fertility clinic didn't give us a great prognosis from there. They could do the micro TESE and ICSI, but they were very uh... stark... with the chances of that working. Plus my husband would have to come off of the testosterone for several months (which is going to throw him on a roller coaster), and each attempt would mean he would need to supplement more and more testosterone. We decided this option was not for us, and have since snuck a few peeks at various sperm donor websites.


We're not ready to really go all in just yet; I'm wrapping up my master's so I'd like to finish that before we add the stress of treatment. Logically I know this, but the emotional part of my brain is just fixating on it. Combined with a barrage of less-than-helpful comments (everything happens for a reason, maybe it's just not meant to be, if it's supposed to happen it'll happen...) I'm feeling frustrated, hopeless, annoyed, and guilty.


And there's a small part of me that I can't quite get to shut up, that wonders if maybe they're right. Maybe I'm not supposed to have kids and I should just focus on what I do have.

I'm so upset, angry, and confused this morning.  Like many of us often feel, I'm sure, I can't help feeling like I'm being punished for something I did in this life or another.

Here's what happened...
I started Lupron (10 units) on 11/11.  Did that for a week until I got my period on Saturday, 11/19.  Decreased Lupron to 5 units, started 225 Gonal F + 75 Menopur (a pretty standard protocol for someone my age, I'm told).  Today is cycle day five.  I went to see the RE this morning for an ultrasound. Turns out I currently have ONE big follicle at 19mm - an early developer or whatever the hell that was sucking up all my meds.  Needless to say, my cycle is cancelled.  No point in doing a retrieval just for one egg.  Apparently this sort of situation is rare (?), but not unheard of, but that certainly doesn't exactly make me feel any better about the situation. The nurse told me that this has happened to other women they've treated and those women go on to have successful retrievals on different protocols, but I'm still scared.  At this point, my doctor's going to regroup and come up with a new protocol.  I'll most likely have to wait until after Christmas to get started again.  This is so fucking unfair, I'm just tired of it. So tired of all of it.  

Has anything similar happened to anyone here?  If so, did you go on to have a successful egg retrieval on a different protocol?

On top of this shit, I had dinner with  my best friend last night who is currently 13 weeks pregnant after trying (naturally) for one month.  She sat there and told me how much being pregnant sucks and how horrible she feels all the time... I get it, it's no fun being nauseated and tired all the time, but do you really think I'm the person you should be venting about this to? I didn't know what to say.

<p>This time around, a new ultrasound tech did tell me I had a 20mm follicle, but didn&#39;t mention if I had any others. She also said my lining was thin, but didn&#39;t mention the number. So for today&#39;s IUI I tried to be a bit more proactive. I had to have another ultrasound beforehand to check the lining - the regular nurse said it looked good but didn&#39;t tell me the number. She mentioned I had a nice follicle and I asked, &quot;how big?&quot; And she just replied, &quot;it looks good.&quot; Then during the IUI I asked how the sperm count looked and she said, &quot;Good.&quot; </p>

<p>I feel like everybody here gets way more detailed info from their doctors, but maybe I&#39;m mistaken?</p>

<p>Bonus question: in the TWW for Thanksgiving and the start of holiday work parties. How are you avoiding alcohol at events centered around alcohol?</p>

I had my second IUI (first was CP) last week and just got an offer for a job that would start June 1. It's a teaching position where the absolute busiest season is August-December. I need to give them my decision by Monday, but I've already asked for more time. 

It's a really cool offer, but I could definitely do something else. I have another offer with a much more flexible start date. 

So, is it lame to accept a job knowing I could possibly be out immediately? We've been trying for almost two years and I'm tired of planning around the thing isn't happening, but I don't know what's ethical here. 

Thanks in advance!

Update: first, thanks to the many amazing responses! This ended up being a nonissue. Not pregnant, of course. However, I do think that I would have told them if I was... it was a lot of soul-searching and talking with my partner, but it was just too important for me to know what kind of support I would have (and there was really no other way to find out without being so obvious), to start making real plans, and overall it just felt skeezy. Idk. Maybe I would have not gone through with it in the end, but I just wanted this update to be out there if anyone is in this situation again and wants to chat.

My husband and I have been trying to conceive since September 2014. I got pregnant in two months, but when I went in for the first ultrasound, the OB couldn't find a heartbeat. Because it was two days before Christmas and the office was closing for the holiday, they told me I had to do a D&C that day. I went in that morning thinking I was going to share an ultrasound picture with my visiting family that night, and walked out kind of in shock.

After about six more months of trying, I just felt like something was wrong, so we saw an RE, and did two IUIs, and both failed. At that point, they did a full work up and told me (through email!) that I had DOR. We moved to IVF, and I didn't respond very well, and only had one day 5 blast. We transferred it and got two very strong betas. When I went in for the first ultrasound, though, his (I know it was a boy because of later testing) heartbeat was only 90 and the RE told me there was essentially no chance of survival. I had to keep going in for ultrasounds until his heartbeat stopped, at which point I had another D&C, and testing revealed a chromosomal abnormality.

After I recovered, I decided to switch clinics, and found one in another state that I liked. My RE there recommended we do the embryo banking program because of my DOR. So we did retrievals there in June, August, and October, loading up the car and the dog and spending 10-12 days in an airbnb each time. After all that, we have some frozen, PGS-normal blasts, and we're going back for a FET in December. 

Oh, and about a year and a half ago, we moved to a new state for my job, and have been told about 1000 times that ""it will be so much easier to make friends here when you have kids.""

Sorry for the long intro. My life has been so completely taken over by this process, and reading this sub has been hugely helpful to know that I'm not the only person going through this, which I so often feel. I no longer have any friends without kids, and I don't think anyone not going through this themselves can understand just how isolating it is.

Background: We've been trying since October 2015. Diagnosed with PCOS six months in, and I've completed four rounds of Femara with TI. First round at 2.5 failed according to progesterone checks, next three at 5 caused ovulation according to ovulation tests and 7DPO blood draws. I've never had a positive pregnancy test.

My doctor (not an RE, but OBGYN who ""specializes"" in infertility at my group office) suggested moving on to IUI. I like him, and have liked his laid back approach in the past. He's the doctor who put me on Femara and who does all of my monthly checkups. The one downside, which I used to think was a positive, is that he's pretty lax on monitoring. For the Femara cycles, I've always just used OPKs and done the blood draws with monthly pelvic exams, and I appreciated that because of my crazy work schedule (I travel for work, often overnight, so making appointments for specific days in a cycle can be super difficult).

When I went to talk to him today, he said we'd go ahead with the IUI, but that the monitoring (or lack thereof) would be the same. Call when you see a surge, IUI will be the next day. While I used to not mind this, it's kind of got me a little more worried to know that I *don't* know exactly how I'm responding to this medication, and whether it's barely working or maybe working too well. 

My insurance covers all of the medications and testing for infertility, but has a lifetime limit for actual procedures, so the IUI's will count towards that at $400/month (and we have a $10k lifetime limit). 

I'm considering calling the closest RE's office to see their availability, but am worried that starting that process will end up with me having so many required appointments that I will have a really tough time making each and every single one every month due to the nature of my job, and that that will almost be worse that doing these cycles with ""lite"" monitoring. I know so many recommend the RE, and for good reason. I'm just stuck on what to do when I don't have the typical 9-5 job. My work is pretty understanding so far, but I'm not sure how well they (or the clients I'm at daily) would do with more appointment than I already have now. 

Any advice? 

Do I try a month or two here or seek out moving on to an RE immediately? I know that this is the last step he really offers.

My best round (IVF#2) had Gonal 300 + Luveris 150 for the first 6 days of stims, starting cycle day 3. Then it was Gonal 300 and cetrotide. So basically a 2:1 ratio of FSH:LH for the first 6 stim days.

My baseline for IVF 5 was today and we're ready to go. However, RE said Luveris is being phased out and he doesn't have it any more. Instead we will do Gonal and Pergoveris. 

Pergoveris is 150 of FH and 75 of LH.
 I am doing a high dose of 450units of gonal today, cycle day 2. Then tomorrow I will do 150 of gonal and 225 of pergoveris. Meaning I will be on a ratio of 300 FSH and 75 LH. 

I'm nervous that the LH is low, considering it's halved what it was on that best cycle. (if I'm understanding correctly). I didn't know the ratio till I got home so didn't say anything to him at the time

I have been TTC for 4+ years and nothing, zip, nada. So we are now in the process of fertility treatment and my doctor started me on 25mg of Clomid and its my first month. I always thought I did ovulate by myself as I got positive OPK's around CD14 but then I did a progesterone draw at 8DPO (this was before Clomid) and my progesterone levels were 9 nmol/L which I have read is too low and means you didn't ovulate?

So back to this cycle I am planning on going in for a progesterone draw on 7 or 8DPO again to check if this Clomid is working, but I'm on CD21 so far and no ovulation! And haven't got the usual signs of it so I am slooowly giving up on it! I was wondering does anyone know when to get your progesterone tested if you didn't ovulate and so can't go in 6-8 DPO?

However i have reached the end of my rope and this is the only place I feel like I'll be heard and understood, so here goes.

I'm 35, husband is 39; we've been together 5 years and married for one.  We officially started trying after we got married last November;  I always knew in the back of my head that it would be a challenge because my periods have been irregular and my GYN said she thought I might have PCOS. Last week I finally saw an RE and after reviewing my cycles and previous blood work he very clearly stated that I'm not ovulating.  He then asked about a LEEP procedure I had in 2010 and stated that that procedure most likely compromised my cervix and is most likely the reason I don't produce any cervical fluid, and definitely don't have any good stuff to help the sperm.

My husband has no sperm, 2 tests both confirm zero sperm... Next is blood work to test hormone levels...

275,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"OK- thanks in advance for letting my rant. I'll try not to make this too long. 

I have a friend. We'll call her Lola. She became one of my closest friends when I moved 5 years ago to a new city. I was partnered up and she was my kooky, fun-loving single friend who always took me on adventures with her. Three years later, she started dating her now husband. But she was still mostly down for fun stuff. 

She was a bridesmaid in my wedding, which was almost 3 years ago now. Lola felt a little uncomfortable that her bf hadn't proposed to her yet, and often talked about feeling ""behind"" with me, which I told her I understood, but she absolutely should not ever feel that way! In the meantime, my husband and I moved for work to another city about 3 hrs away. Then Lola got engaged about a year and a half ago. I was so thrilled for her and she asked me to be a bridesmaid. 

I came out to her about my infertility in a tearful phone conversation. She said a few weird things, oscillating between ""that would feel like a death sentence"" and ""its no big deal, you can just do IVF, right?"" but was mostly supportive. I told her that one of the surprising things about dealing with IF has been my difficulty talking about babies and pregnancy with other people- its very painful. 

As all this was going on, I planned and hosted her bachelorette party. This occurred this past May. At the bachelorette, every single person there was either pregnant or a parent, except for Lola and me. Lola basically spent the entire 2 1/2 days talking about her plans for pregnancy, her baby names, asking pregnant people tons of questions, etc. Ignoring me of course in the mix. Basically 100% ignoring what I told her, which was that conversations about pregnancy are very hard for me. I got really mad a few times, but I didnt say anything because this was her bachelorette. (Aren't we supposed to be like looking at naked dudes or something? What kind of a bachelorette is this?!)

Cut to 5 days before her wedding. This is June of this year. Lola had asked me to be the only other person besides her sister to give a toast at her wedding. I was happy to do it, despite being frustrated with her lately. Lola texts me and our mutual friend (who has been extremely supportive of me despite being very pregnant)  that she ""got some weird news."" She proceeds to say over text that she was pregnant at her bachelorette (she was wasted the whole time, but I assume she did not know), but she went in for a check-up and she had a missed miscarriage. ""I have to get it vacuumed out now! Whoops!"" Those were her exact words. 

My first reaction was OMG POOR LOLA. My second was wondering why she was being so cavalier about this. I called her to ask if she was doing okay, what I could do, and she literally said ""I am actually fine, just annoyed if I can't have sex on my honeymoon. But at the end of the day, at least I know I can GET pregnant. Woohoo!""

I almost died right there. I had to get off the phone quickly and deal with a lot of sh*t. Like you are bragging to me about getting pregnant without trying? Anyway. I gave her toast at her wedding, it was all lovely, she had a D&C and had a lovely honeymoon, etc. Meanwhile, I was going through IVF- shots and drs appts and my retrieval- none of which she was there for. She didnt call to ask me about it. 

Two months ago I wrote her an email to try to lightly explain why this time had been hard for me and how I wanted to save our friendship. She gave me a (mostly) sweet reply and my heart melted for her again. I still didnt trust her with all the details of my situation, so I didnt tell her when we were going to transfer our embryo. 

We went ahead and transferred in October. It failed. I was in a depression for about 3 weeks that I have recently come out of. I wrote Lola an email after some time to tell her what had happened. She wrote me back to say how sorry she was, but how much she looked forward to seeing me over Thanksgiving. 

Cut to yesterday. She wrote me an email and guess what: she's pregnant. What's more? Her due date is when mine would have been- had my embryo lived. 

I haven't responded to her because I am grappling with being there for her, saving our friendship, and taking care of me. I just don't understand why 2016 is so goddamn awful and why the universe just keeps throwing this shit my way. I am trying to go into 2017 after healing from our first FET and trying to gear up for another transfer, and then this is what happens?

She's been a good friend to me in other respects, and she was there for me when my mom was sick last year. But this seems to be..a tough issue for us. 


tl;dr: a very close friend of mine had previously put distance between us bc she was insensitive about my infertility. but now she is pregnant and her due date is what mine was before i lost my embryo. i love her but i need to love myself, what do i do?

Backstory: For about a month, I'd been hearing from the other nurses/phlebotomists/etc that there was a new nurse, and that she wasn't a pile of fun to work with. The general consensus was she was ""too much."" My mother thinks this was unprofessional of them to tell me this, but I mean fucks sake I'm there every day for the past two years, it's not like they're probably telling everyone who walks in.

SO anyhow, the new nurse was assigned to my transfer. She's around 55 years old and is grinning like a maniac at me walking me back to pre op.

She asks me if I've done this before (fair question) and I was like ""yes, I know the drill"" and then she grins at me like a deaths head and goes ""DID IT WORK?""

Wut. I sort of look at her for a second and I was like... ""well.. no."" and then she goes ""WELL THIS ONE IS THE ONE!""

Silence on my part. The phlebotomist was walking through and heard the whole exchange and is miming exaggerated eye rolls behind her.

Whatever, she's new, it's fine. We go in for my transfer, and even though I've told her that this is not my first rodeo, she's explaining everything and super nervous. Fine, I let her explain, maybe this is her first transfer. She also expresses sorrow that my husband isn't with me - I tell her he never comes and she makes a BIG FROWNY FACE AT ME.  Excuse, he does not need to be here when they shove a straw up my cervix. We just aren't that couple.

FINALLY my awesome doctor comes in and we are ready to go. Doctor is like ""Let's do this!"" and I go ""Lets get me knocked up!"" and the nurse sort of skitters uncomfortably. Embryo up on the screen, name check, yup that's mine and the fucking nurse goes ""There's your baby!""

That was it for me - I told her that wasn't a baby. Dr. also agrees, that's not a baby. Then Dr. and I talk about the forest fires in this state while she gets my cervix straw all up in there, while the nurse weirdly puts her hand on my should her and keeps trying to look into my eyes like we are all making the miracle of life together. 

After the transfer while they're flushing out the catheter making sure lone embryo isn't stuck up in there, my Dr. was like ""you  have no idea how much everyone here wants this for you"" and the nurse jumps in with ""we want it for EVERY patient!!"" AND that was the end of that convo. I could only see my Dr.'s eyes, but they were hysterical. She was TFAB come to life. LIVE TFAB.

I was laughing so hard when I left, it was probably beneficial for transfer. I can't imagine having to do procedures with Mary Sunshine every day - but they're also lucky that I wasn't having a sensitive day, because who the FUCK ASKS YOU IF YOUR LAST TRANSFER FAILED AT YOUR OWN RE's office.

280,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all – do any of you have experience with hypothyroid issues? 

I had a diagnostic genetic test done awhile ago that showed I have an inactive liver gene (CYP450). This gene is responsible for processing stuff like most antidepressants and opioids (we finally found out why SSRIs don't work for me! Also, codeine cough syrup). 

It also impacts the effectiveness of Clomid – I managed to convince my RE to put me on letrozole instead for that reason.

I've recently come to learn that it is also responsible for metabolizing/converting about 60% of your thyroid hormone load. It also contributes to progesterone metabolism.

My free T4 and TSH levels have all come in at the normal range, but we haven't run any T3/antibody levels for me. I know that you can have hypothyroidism, or at least subclinical hypothyroidism, within the ""normal"" range of T4/TSH.

I've also learned that hypothyroid can be associated with premenstrual spotting and chemical pregnancies, both of which I've been struggling with.

I've actually been tested for hypothyroid before – I have ongoing problems with chronic bronchitis, fatigue, chilly hands/feet, and eczema/dry skin. But since those basic levels have always come back okay, nobody's ever followed up with it.

Am I officially a Bonkers Lady, or is this something I should seriously hustle my RE about testing before we proceed? I realize we all have hopes of finding some sort of ""magic bullet"", but the last year or so has been a non-stop parade of discovering how this stupid genetic blip has fucked me over in sneaky ways over the course of my life.
