Any idea what I can expect? I am a little nervous it will just be ""pay us enough and we will make it happen."" I personally think there's more testing/monitoring to be done.

He thinks it is strictly a ""sperm meets egg"" problem and thinks the next step for me is an IUI. Is this standard? Is it possible that even though I am ovulating according to the blood work that there is still something not quite right?

I agreed to try it out (I didn&#39;t even ask what the side effects to me would be; I am that desperate).  Anyone else done a protocol like this?</p>

<p>The protocol involves prednisone, z-pack, PIO shots (1/day) and progesterone supplements (1/day) starting on Monday, transfer on Wednesday, then Pepcid and Claritin starting on Friday, daily until 12 weeks of pregnancy. I&#39;m a bit worried about whether there really are no adverse consequences to our baby (including post-birth) from those medications.</p>

<p>Side note: I do have perennial allergies but have resisted ever taking allergy medication (other than an herbal supplement, which worked well during the time I was taking it), so it&#39;ll be interesting to actually treat them now and not be a frequent mouthbreather.</p>

The RE I saw today put forward the possibility of canceling, but when she called just now after talking with my RE, she said my RE wants to continue with stims to be on track for retrieval next week.  She said my ovarian reserve may be lower than we thought and that we'll increase the meds next cycle to try for more eggs.  (My follicle count was 13, but despite my second AMH value of 1.51, I did have a first, lower AMH value of 0.4, which had been kind of dismissed as probably a mistake as it was done at a different lab.)

One thing that seems weird to me is that despite my lower follicle count at the day four scan (six follicles plus a few smaller ones that didn't make it to today) and an estradiol level of 89 (should have been 100-250), they didn't increase my meds at all.  Also, I did four days of Ganirelix the week before stimming, which a few people commented was unusual.  

There's also the troubling matter of some unknown bit hanging around my right ovary.  We've been keeping an eye on it , and at first they thought it might be a cyst, but apparently it looks just like a hydrosalpinx.  Except... *I had my tubes removed in October.*  Did a bit of tube get left behind?  Maybe.  I'll have to have another HSG to be sure.  But this eliminates any possibility of a fresh transfer, which sucks as the REs are now advising against biopsy since we'll likely only get one embryo. 

Also, and I just need to vent here, we had kind of shitty service at breakfast after the scan and my husband didn't want to tip.  I waited tables for years and always tip unless the service is egregiously bad (which it was not, in my opinion).  So I tipped (only 15%, even a little less!), and he just wouldn't let it go on the drive home, despite my begging him to, as my mind is very much on my inability to produce eggs and I just didn't want to put my energy into arguing about it.

My doctor told me today that it may be random or it may indicate a ""rapidly diminishing ovarian reserve.""

I'm 31, so my original gyno made me wait a full year before starting to do any testing even though my cycles were absurd (ranging from 36-54 days). There's been some discussion of it potentially being PCOS, but I've never gotten a definitive diagnosis. In the meantime, I started going to a acupuncturist who specializes in fertility.

I finally switched doctors, got CD3 bloodwork, an HSG - all good except my TSH levels were borderline high. I was put on Clomid this cycle and ovulated on CD 19, which was super exciting. I finally felt like we had a remote chance of it happening this cycle for the first time in months.

That same day, I got a call about my husband's sperm analysis. His morphology is extremely low: 0.5%. My initial reaction is that it is because he is on Prozac. He has an appointment scheduled for next week to get weaned off of that and put on Wellbutrin instead. 

I still got my 21 day bloodwork - progesterone looked good, but HSG was negative. No surprise there. My doc is recommending that I slow down tracking everything with OPKs wait on doing anymore Clomid cycles until the halflife of the Prozac ends and we can do another sperm analysis - 6 weeks from next week.

So at this point, I'm just feeling defeated. I have scheduled an appointment with a fertility clinic in 2 weeks to see what our options are. I'm fearful that Prozac isn't the issue and now we're both dealing with physical issues. Before when I knew I was the one with the strange cycle, I could handle it. I was taking all my vitamins, doing acupuncture, going to the doctor and feeling like I was making progress. Now with both of us, I just don't know.

I honestly want to just skip the Clomid, IUI, etc. etc. and move onto IVF because I'm so sick of trying to troubleshoot a problem with methods that aren't helping. I don't even know if they will do that. Will fertility clinics allow you to move forward to IVF without trying IUIs?

It's the only thing of significance that has popped up that could be causing his severe MFI. There are two methods we can use - surgery (where they actually cut into skin and tie off the vein) or an embolization, which uses tubes and xrays and little metal coils to block off the problem area. When we met with the urologist two weeks ago, he said we could probably schedule the surgery in a couple of weeks, and we would wait at least another 4-6 weeks before cycling again. 

We decided to investigate that embolization procedure (less invasive and shorter recovery time) and just had that appointment today. The earliest we can get in for that particular procedure is sometime in January. Meaning we can't cycle until March at the earliest. I am so fucking annoyed. Why does every step of this process have to be so time consuming? I asked Mr. Alces if he would consider the surgery if it meant he could get it done sooner, and he was on the fence. I get wanting to have the less invasive option, but fuck, if it's a month or so difference, can't we at least consider the surgery?

I know that I am being a bit irrational and letting my emotions overtake my logic. I really wish the urologist had set realistic expectations. I've emailed the urologist to see how quickly the surgery could be scheduled, and Mr. Alces and I agreed we would go from there. 

To top if off, I get upset and cry, and Mr Alces is all logic - ""we can't do anything about it"" - I KNOW, darling, but I can't help that I'm emotional. You'd think after almost 7 years together, he would get that.

The earliest we can get in for that particular procedure is sometime in January. Meaning we can&#39;t cycle until March at the earliest. I am so fucking annoyed. Why does every step of this process have to be so time consuming? I asked Mr. Alces if he would consider the surgery if it meant he could get it done sooner, and he was on the fence. I get wanting to have the less invasive option, but fuck, if it&#39;s a month or so difference, can&#39;t we at least consider the surgery?</p>

<p>I know that I am being a bit irrational and letting my emotions overtake my logic. I really wish the urologist had set realistic expectations. I&#39;ve emailed the urologist to see how quickly the surgery could be scheduled, and Mr. Alces and I agreed we would go from there. </p>

<p>To top if off, I get upset and cry, and Mr Alces is all logic - &quot;we can&#39;t do anything about it&quot; - I KNOW, darling, but I can&#39;t help that I&#39;m emotional. You&#39;d think after almost 7 years together, he would get that. </p>

<p>UPDATE: Good news - urologist can book the surgery on December 2! Mr Alces is in agreement that the sooner, the better, so it looks like this is happening next week! The rollercoaster continues. Thanks to everyone for the support!</p>

Jon had cancer in the past, so he’s had the experience of getting that call from the doctor and hearing “You have cancer,” even though cancer was highly improbable. Since his father had colon cancer, it added to our feeling that no matter what the statistics said, we “probably” had cancer. 

Our experience with infertility also drove this outlook; we should “probably” be pregnant by now.

I am new to this sub so I thought I would introduce myself and also pose a question. My partner and I have been ttc for 4 years, I have PCOS and a blocked tube (damn you, righty!). SAs in the normal range, but not always great. I've done 4 IUIs (3 w/Clomid, 1 w/ injectables) and just finished the first half of a freeze-all IVF cycle.

I had my ER about three weeks ago and it turned into a freeze-all cycle (due to OHSS risk - my clinic seems to be super-paranoid about this). In a couple of weeks I'll be starting the process to get ready for an FET likely in January.

I haven't had a chance to talk to my doctor about it yet. I would love to know, for people who have done an FET, the specifics of the drugs you had to take - are there different protocols the way there are for the first half of the cycle, or is it the same for everybody? If you don't mind sharing this, how much were the drugs for the FET part of the cycle? If you have insurance, did you find the coverage for them differed from those in the first half of the cycle? (My husband and I both had 0 coverage for anything infertility-related on our plans, including the fact that none of the drugs were covered; but he was doing some looking yesterday and seemed to think some of these ones might be covered?)

I'm the ugly step-sister to her Cinderella. Everyone loves her, she's pretty, she's outgoing and friendly and bubbly. She married up (like whoa) and everyone loves her high finance Gaston (to my Tweedledum). When she announced her engagement, my mom cried; when I got engaged, she laughed. 

Should I go on, or do you get my point?

Being the attention whores they are, of course they announced their engagement at a holiday one year. Every holiday I am TERRIFIED, that she will up an announce that they are expecting. Not only is that not fun for us in the first place, but to learn it in front of a crowd (of her adoring fans) would literally kill me. 

I was hoping we could skip Thanksgiving and go with my inlaws instead (even though I do not like them) just to avoid the possibility, but my MIL is stubborn and ""has made other plans"" (which she won't tell my husband about).  

My family does not know about our IF, though I don't know how they couldn't suspect at this point. Not that it would matter much anyway if the news of a new royal baby were to pop up, I'd be completely ignored and shoved aside anyway. 

I hate that I have these feelings towards her, hate that I can't just enjoy a holiday with my family (as if they aren't hard enough already!). My husband's solution is to just not go, but I'd just hate that I let her keep me away from MY family as well, you know?

I started a FET cycle over the weekend (my fourth) but on Tuesday I finally had a long awaited consultation (I made the appointment in April) with a pregnancy and repeated implantation failure specialist. (AKA medicine's most depressing speciality). I really liked the guy; he was both very smart and very well-related.  He was clearly skilled at talking to someone who has gone through pregnancy loss, he was compassionate but never spoke down to me. He recommended I cancel the cycle and pursue a few more evaluations. So here is my new plan:

1) Repeated Endometrial Biopsy to see if inflammation persists. If so, three weeks of antibiotics and follow-up biopsy.

2) Insulin resistance test.

3) Further blood work, including testing for TPO anti-bodies; this may be of interest to thyroid ladies but apparently the presence of these anti-bodies are correlated with infertility/miscarriage and according to the doctor I met with new research (sorry, I should have asked for a source on this) can be addressed with Selenium. 

4) Start taking Folic Acid above and beyond that in pre-natal (2mg). This he put into the won't hurt, might help category. 

I left the appointment feeling hopeful and in very good hands. Today, I'm feeling more complicated feelings about delaying the cycle. After three years, every delay of a month or two both doesn't matter at all and really fucking matters. (Side concern: Still don't know if I'll get money back for the cancelled cycle). 

I do have peace that I'm doing the right thing and turning over every stone.  His rationale for canceling the cycle was essentially: God forbid, this happens again, you don't want to wonder. Both kind and direct.

I also wanted to say that I mentioned in a previous post that my husband was going to be out of town for this consultation. Someone on the sub who lives in my city offered to come with me. I don't want blow up her spot because she seems like a humble gal but it was amazing that she offered this and she was an unbelievable source of support and helpful questions during the appointment.

Our surgical consult was yesterday. We had psyched ourselves up to go in and get this done. Over a month to wait for the consult, but the desk assured us that after the consult, actually getting in for the surgery was easy(48 hours max). We had all our ducks in a row. House clean, proper recovery foods, comfy jammies, new couch to recover on, arrangements for the pets to be taken care of and work off. 

We went in for the consult, and right off the bat the doc wants another ultrasound to get a good look at it(He'd only noted it our first visit, then monitored it to see if it changed throughout our treatment). For the ultrasound, he couldn't determine if it was a dermoid(requires bigger surgery, cannot remove laparoscopy as it must be removed intact) or a fibrous mass(can be removed via laparoscopy) . 

Doc gives radiology a call, and they agree that an MRI is the best way to go to determine which surgery is needed, so now we're set back by half a week waiting on that. Then the doc says it wouldn't be likely we could even get in for surgery until December, anyway.

THEN! Then! Get this. *The front office sends back a note that our insurance has dropped their clinic entirely as of November.* No notice, nothing. Our favorite doc that has been busting his backside to help us, that we trust, cannot work with us any longer. They're fighting the insurance for us to get us grandfathered in, but between that and having to wait further for the mri results and everything, we were just defeated.

97,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'm new here. I've been a reddit lurker for a long time, but I never thought about searching reddit for anything fertility-related until my husband mentioned he was doing some reddit reading last night. I just need to vent and speak my frustrations out loud.

Eight years ago, I was in a bad place so I slept with an acquaintance (really a neighbor of a friend I didn't know that well at all). We used a condom and it broke, so I took the morning after pill and about 6 weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. I was terrified, but I knew I would have my daughter anyway. So I spent the next 5 years raising my child as a single mom. Her dad and I have remained good friends and he is involved in her life. We've worked really hard to make it a very healthy relationship and I'm proud of us. 

I started dating my now-husband in 2011 and we married 2 years ago this December. We've been trying to get pregnant for those 2 years. I've been watching everyone around me get pregnant. My daughter asks me all the time, ""Mommy, when will I have a younger brother or sister?"" We went for testing and everything came back normal. (I did recently find out I *may* have a blocked tube on my left side).  Time just keeps passing and I'm still not pregnant. And I've been so angry.

I was in a situation in which many many women would have had an abortion. (And I have no judgments to those that do).  I went through so much pain during that time of my life- it was lonely and scary.  Of course, I would never change it for the world.  And now, that I'm married and trying to have a child with the man that I've committed myself to for the rest of my life, I'm not able to get pregnant?!?

I have been mad at God. I spent the summer asking Him why I deserve this. I really do know better, but I'm still angry.

I can feel the anger fading and it's good. I've been praying more throughout the day to ask for peace. It's just hard. I feel like every time I gain a little ground emotionally, something else is there to kick us in the ass.

Yesterday we went to a fertility specialist. We are looking to explore our options with IUI and IVF. But then we got the estimate after the office looked at our insurance. We are going to be able to afford about 2 rounds of IUI or one round of IVF and that's it.  Because just paying for that will put us in more debt than we can take on right now.

We got home last night and we both felt a weird combination of encouraged and discouraged. Encouraged because maybe there are options for us and discouraged because of the financial aspect. A few hours after we got back from our appointment last night, we get a call from our brother and sister in law...calling to tell us they're pregnant. The timing could not have been worse. Of course we are happy for them, but last night it felt like I was punched in the stomach.

How do I get through this pain and get over my anger? 

TL;DR I got pregnant 8 years ago from one night of sex, a broken condom, and the morning after pill. Raised my daughter as a single mom. Now, I'm married and trying to conceive- can't get pregnant.

I&#39;ve been a reddit lurker for a long time, but I never thought about searching reddit for anything fertility-related until my husband mentioned he was doing some reddit reading last night. I just need to vent and speak my frustrations out loud.</p>

<p>Eight years ago, I was in a bad place so I slept with an acquaintance (really a neighbor of a friend I didn&#39;t know that well at all). We used a condom and it broke, so I took the morning after pill and about 6 weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. I was terrified, but I knew I would have my daughter anyway. So I spent the next 5 years raising my child as a single mom. Her dad and I have remained good friends and he is involved in her life. We&#39;ve worked really hard to make it a very healthy relationship and I&#39;m proud of us. </p>

<p>I started dating my now-husband in 2011 and we married 2 years ago this December. We&#39;ve been trying to get pregnant for those 2 years. I&#39;ve been watching everyone around me get pregnant. My daughter asks me all the time, &quot;Mommy, when will I have a younger brother or sister?&quot; We went for testing and everything came back normal. (I did recently find out I <em>may</em> have a blocked tube on my left side).  Time just keeps passing and I&#39;m still not pregnant. And I&#39;ve been so angry.</p>

<p>I was in a situation in which many many women would have had an abortion. (And I have no judgments to those that do).  I went through so much pain during that time of my life- it was lonely and scary.  Of course, I would never change it for the world.  And now, that I&#39;m married and trying to have a child with the man that I&#39;ve committed myself to for the rest of my life, I&#39;m not able to get pregnant?!?</p>

<p>I have been mad at God. I spent the summer asking Him why I deserve this. I really do know better, but I&#39;m still angry.</p>

<p>I can feel the anger fading and it&#39;s good. I&#39;ve been praying more throughout the day to ask for peace. It&#39;s just hard. I feel like every time I gain a little ground emotionally, something else is there to kick us in the ass.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to a fertility specialist. We are looking to explore our options with IUI and IVF. But then we got the estimate after the office looked at our insurance. We are going to be able to afford about 2 rounds of IUI or one round of IVF and that&#39;s it.  Because just paying for that will put us in more debt than we can take on right now.</p>

<p>We got home last night and we both felt a weird combination of encouraged and discouraged. Encouraged because maybe there are options for us and discouraged because of the financial aspect. A few hours after we got back from our appointment last night, we get a call from our brother and sister in law...calling to tell us they&#39;re pregnant. The timing could not have been worse. Of course we are happy for them, but last night it felt like I was punched in the stomach.</p>

<p>How do I get through this pain and get over my anger? </p>

Does anyone know if it is ok to use the Clear Blue Easy digital tester for multiple cycles? As in, the box I got last month had 7 tests in it, and I only used 5. Will the result be unreliable to use the same digital tester with one of the unused test sticks for this month's cycle?

As a small back story, my husband had cancer/chemotherapy as a teenager and does not have any sperm. As far as I know, I do not have any problems that would affect my fertility. (I have had basic day 3 and day 21 blood work that is all in the good range as well as regular periods and positive opks monthy.) So, for the past 3 months we have been doing IUI with donor sperm. I am taking clomid 50mg on cycle day 5-9 just to hopefully increase our chances of success. However, I am not having any monitoring other than home opks. I know many of you will say that's not ideal which is probably true, but it is what it is for this cycle at least. So here is my dilema... I am on cycle day 14 today. The last two cycles where I took the exact same clomid dose, I got a positive opk on day 15 at almost the exact same time of day in the afternoon. So I was expecting my positive opk tomorrow afternoon instead of today. So when I took my opk this morning at work, it was almost as a afterthought because I was certain it wouldn't be positive until tomorrow. The problem is, it was positive, and now I'm concerned it was a false positive. Since I was testing at work today (I worked over night last night), I used the same digital tester that I had left over in my work bag from last month with a new tester stick. I didn't think much about that until I got the surprise positive LH surge.  As soon as I got home from work, I opened a new box and tested again, and it was negative this time.  That was about 5 hours later. So there are 2 possibilities. One is that I  got my LH surge one day earlier this month with a true positive early this morning and then it was over by the time I got home and retested. The other is that since I used the digital tester from last month, it is trying to use data from last month and is giving me a false positve and I actually haven't had my LH surge yet.

The plan was to do IUI this month the day after my positive opk. Since I have already had my frozen donor sperm shipped, I have to decide whether to do the IUI tomorrow or wait until the next day. I will test again in the morning, but still if I get a negative again in the morning I won't be sure whether I have already had my LH surge this morning or I haven't had it yet.

(I have had basic day 3 and day 21 blood work that is all in the good range as well as regular periods and positive opks monthy.) So, for the past 3 months we have been doing IUI with donor sperm. I am taking clomid 50mg on cycle day 5-9 just to hopefully increase our chances of success. However, I am not having any monitoring other than home opks. I know many of you will say that&#39;s not ideal which is probably true, but it is what it is for this cycle at least. So here is my dilema... I am on cycle day 14 today. The last two cycles where I took the exact same clomid dose, I got a positive opk on day 15 at almost the exact same time of day in the afternoon. So I was expecting my positive opk tomorrow afternoon instead of today. So when I took my opk this morning at work, it was almost as a afterthought because I was certain it wouldn&#39;t be positive until tomorrow. The problem is, it was positive, and now I&#39;m concerned it was a false positive. Since I was testing at work today (I worked over night last night), I used the same digital tester that I had left over in my work bag from last month with a new tester stick. I didn&#39;t think much about that until I got the surprise positive LH surge.  As soon as I got home from work, I opened a new box and tested again, and it was negative this time.  That was about 5 hours later. So there are 2 possibilities. One is that I  got my LH surge one day earlier this month with a true positive early this morning and then it was over by the time I got home and retested. The other is that since I used the digital tester from last month, it is trying to use data from last month and is giving me a false positve and I actually haven&#39;t had my LH surge yet.</p>

<p>The plan was to do IUI this month the day after my positive opk. Since I have already had my frozen donor sperm shipped, I have to decide whether to do the IUI tomorrow or wait until the next day. I will test again in the morning, but still if I get a negative again in the morning I won&#39;t be sure whether I have already had my LH surge this morning or I haven&#39;t had it yet. Any insight would be appreciated.  </p>

I'm ok with the decision not to do a fresh transfer.  I was miserable and my body needed rest after making a whopping 33 eggs.

Everything (other than the procedure running late and nearly peeing my hospital bed trying to hold a full bladder) about the transfer went by the book.  The thawed embryos looked beautiful.

I&#39;m always all about being strategic, tactful, catching flies with honey, so pre-emptively cutting her off feels like going nuclear and a very unfamiliar way to handle her.</p>

<p>My family is very normal and low-key; I have zero experience managing things like this in a family and have always just tried to support my husband when he has to deal with something with her.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

When my wife was 20, she was diagnosed with PCOS and told (wrongly) that she would never be able to have children. Even though we weren't married then and hadn't even been thinking about kids yet, she was devastated and left in tears. We now know that there are many options and treatments that have been successful for women with PCOS, but at the time we were so young and didn't question it.

Fast forward five years to 2011 and we are getting married and it's at this point that we both started trying, gradually. I know it sounds weird to put it that way but that's because it was weird. We started using contraception only intermittently and then not at all. She started tracking her cycles and we both started watching for the start of each period and for fertile signs. But nether of us said anything about it to each other - if we didn't admit that we were trying, then we weren't failing. I know it sounds stupid, but keep in mind at this point we still thought that she didn't even really have a shot at conceiving naturally anyway.

Finally, in January 2015, after four years of this, my wife found out unexpectedly that she was pregnant. We were still trying without acknowledging it but had long ago given up hope that it would actually happen. The pregnancy progressed well until 19 weeks, when my wife went into sudden preterm labor and our son was delivered 3/29/2015 at 6:27 PM. He was technically not born alive because he did not take a breath on his own, but he still had a heartbeat and was still moving when he was born. He was alive by my definition and his name is Walker.

It is now going on eight months since he passed and we have had no luck conceiving again. This time we are more open with our efforts, with ourselves, with each other, and with those who are close to us. My wife has been placed on metformin and we have tried three failed Clomid cycles (50, 50, 150).

My child has the funniest sense of humour. Is that what it is? She likes to play hide and seek, or “catch me if you can”. Or is it a he? I’m not exactly sure, but I speak to him or her. I think of him or her. All the time. I imagine what she would look like, what it would feel like to have him snuggle up on my lap, or in between Corey and I on the couch, or how it would be to have her tucked inside a snugglie inside my coat on a crisp Saturday walk about the city. I think of how soft his hair is, the colour a meeting place between Corey’s brown and my blonde, her eyes the perfect blend of green and blue. I think of how he would be the perfect fit for this silent space we made for her.

Missing someone you have never met is the strangest thing. It occupies every nook and cranny, fills in all the dark corners you can never reach, the muscles you didn’t even know were there until they started to hurt. Soon enough, you are walking around your everyday with an aching, throbbing pain deep inside your chest that isn’t easy to talk about, that not everyone understands, that not even you can understand. I never thought I would be this way. When I was in my early twenties, so principled and thinking myself so world-aware, if the topic of fertility treatments like in-vitro fertilization ever came up, I would say dismissively at the television or radio or to whoever was listening, “if a woman can’t get pregnant *naturally*, then she should just adopt. The universe is trying to send her a message.” And yet here I am, fifteen or so years later, with an acute awareness that has come with time, experience and heartbreak, that that 20 year old woman simply didn’t know what the fuck she was talking about. At the same time, a part of me misses being that person, and wishes that it still felt that simple, that black and white. I feel ashamed and embarrassed that I have let things get more complicated, that those early disappointments started to soften the edges and blur the lines. I wish it felt like the universe was actually talking to me. I stand outside in the dark and there is nothing there. 

For many years now we have been trying to coax him out into the world. Or her. It’s been six years, almost seven, and I hate that I am counting, or that I even have to count. All it does is make the missing her part even more excruciating. There have been a few times, a few glimmers of hope, where it seemed that we might actually meet. Positive tests and hormones rising, but in my heart I always knew the persistent bleeding was a bad sign. “It happens sometimes, don’t worry,” but I knew. Your gut will speak to you if you listen, or sometimes you don’t even have to listen, it just taps at your shoulder incessantly. 

I am not one of those women whose reproductive system is some kind of trustworthy thing, some beautiful mystery of womanhood, tucked inside their bellies, ready to spring into action. I am not someone who never had to think about it, or who got pregnant by accident. I am not someone who has ever had that part of my body function normally. It is a part of my body that has been poked and prodded by countless doctors, laparoscopic surgeries to scrape and cauterize and remove any signs of endometriosis, hormones prescribed in an effort to will my menstrual cycle into submission. The pain has been unbearable at times. “Well, we only consider it severe pain if you are bringing yourself to the ER,” a doctor once said to me. I was dumbfounded. Countless memories came to mind of me curled up and moaning in bed, in seething pain. Carting myself up to the ER, where I could curl and moan and breath through my teeth while sitting on a hard plastic chair in the waiting room for hours until someone might actually see me, is the very last thing I would want to do while in that amount of pain. “She has to self-medicate,” my husband tried. “She takes pain medication and drinks scotch. She’s in a lot of pain.” The doctor nodded blankly, unmoved. 

I knew it might take us a little longer in light of this. I knew that my body might give us a fight. And indeed it has. More poking and prodding, jabbing needles stuffed with hormones into my body, and don’t even get me started on the number of times I have had a dildo-shaped ultrasound wand rammed up into my vagina. My body has felt anything but a fertile place. It has felt like an empty and often very lonely place.  Over time, my feelings about infertility have become so tangled. Once you start down the path of trying to solve the problem, you get further and further into the weeds until finally you look around and realize you’ve walked much further into the muck than you told yourself you would. And yet, you keep walking because something in you tells you that thing you are looking for could be just up ahead. Just there. See? You can almost see it. And so you keep going, for a while at least. There has to be an end point somewhere, whether it’s a financial one or an emotional one or just a line drawn on your mental calendar. Otherwise, it truly drives you mad. Still, though, it is never that simple. That end point hovers over me, taunting me, and in some ways puts even more pressure on me. *This is your last chance to lose ten pounds and see if it’s the magic key. Better deal with that stress now because it can’t be helping your chances. Are you sure you are eating all the right things, and not eating all the wrong things? Are you taking all the right supplements? Are you sure?*

More poking and prodding, jabbing needles stuffed with hormones into my body, and don’t even get me started on the number of times I have had a dildo-shaped ultrasound wand rammed up into my vagina. My body has felt anything but a fertile place. It has felt like an empty and often very lonely place.  Over time, my feelings about infertility have become so tangled. Once you start down the path of trying to solve the problem, you get further and further into the weeds until finally you look around and realize you’ve walked much further into the muck than you told yourself you would. And yet, you keep walking because something in you tells you that thing you are looking for could be just up ahead. Just there. See? You can almost see it. And so you keep going, for a while at least. There has to be an end point somewhere, whether it’s a financial one or an emotional one or just a line drawn on your mental calendar. Otherwise, it truly drives you mad. Still, though, it is never that simple. That end point hovers over me, taunting me, and in some ways puts even more pressure on me. <em>This is your last chance to lose ten pounds and see if it’s the magic key. Better deal with that stress now because it can’t be helping your chances. Are you sure you are eating all the right things, and not eating all the wrong things? Are you taking all the right supplements? Are you sure?</em></p>

**Fuck You, Facebook**

If you’re feeling pretty chipper /
And you haven’t any doubt /
That your life is on the fast track /
And you’ve got it figured out /

I know a place to go to make /
Those feelings go away /
And replace them with a sense that /
All your dreams have gone astray /

A place where all your friends /
Are sharing only their good news /
Where everyone is happy and /
They never seem to lose /

I used to write a post or two /
For each and every day /
But now when I log in there’s /
Just one thing I want to say /


*It’s “Fuck you Facebook” /
I can’t wait for your demise /
And also to my friends who are /
Just filled with outright lies* /


George is on vacation /
Sally’s got a great new job /
Frank just had a baby /
With his great new husband Bob /

Greg works at McKinsey /
He’s racking up the miles /
He was upgraded to first class /
And just had to share his smile /

In case you had forgotten /
Susie’s wedding years ago /
Here’s a reminder that she’s married /
To the most amazing beau /

“Can you believe it's ten years /
Since I married my best friend /
I’m so blessed our happy union /
Is just never gonna end” /


*So “Fuck you Facebook” /
I can’t wait for your demise /
And also to my friends who are /
Just filled with outright lies* /


Do you ever wonder /
What some honesty could do /
If we shared the truth on Facebook /
Even when we’re feeling blue /

While I’m happy you got pregnant /
On just your second try /
Maybe I’ll post that I’ve been trying /
Since July 2005 /

And by the way last April /
When I didn’t call you back /
It’s ‘cause I was busy having /
An anxiety attack /

While my husband's posting photos /
Of him fishing on the sea /
He's at the bar around the corner /
And he won't come home to me /

Now I have a problem /
With a few prescription meds /
There’s a bottle in my bathroom /
And two more beside my bed /

So every time you post ‘bout how / 
Your little babe has grown /
I’ll assume that just like mine /
Your life is a disaster zone /


And I’ll say ...

We are unexplained (AMH - 1.64 and husband's morphology - 4% were of some concern, but OK otherwise). After 6 months of trying I decided to get organized, talked to my insurance, got assigned a reproductive nurse/consultant, and learned that we have something like 1.5 IVF worth lifetime cap (treatment and meds). After a bit of diagnostics, we decided to go forward with IVF, because I felt like $$/success rate looked better, at least until we eat through the insurance money. I made triple OK with my insurance consultant that going directly to IVF was not a problem. So now I am on track to IVF, been on birth control for 2 months (and not happy about it), supposed to start stimming next Saturday, and ER Nov 30th. I've had a back-and-forth with the clinic-insurance-Caremark pharmacy for about a month now, they never seemed to have talked to each other effectively. So today, week before I am supposed to start stimming, I got a final decision letter from the insurance saying that they are not going to pay for Menopur and Follistim, because I have not done three cycles of Clomid beforehand. Now I know this is peanuts compared to what a lot of you deal with, but I have not budgeted for random -$4,000 and have not been this close to crying at work yet. I checked with the insurance consultant and she was able to tell me only that the ""treatment"" branch of insurance and ""meds"" branch of insurance simply do not talk to each other (the good news is that ""treatment"" branch of insurance is still willing to go ahead with the IVF). I just don't know what to do. Nobody is going to talk to me during the weekend anyway, so thinking time. The way I see it:
Option #1 - suck it up and absorb the 4k, probably more, but get the cycle going (getting IF treatment and house down-payment in the same year was too optimistic anyways, right?). Of course this happened in the midst of the great Bravelle recall, but I take all and any tips for discount meds that deliver really fast.
Option #2 - get mad, drop everything, and probably lose 1k (we paid $500 of IVF ""down-payment"" and they are gonna charge us another $500 for cancelation, if I manage to get the whole thing dropped EOD Monday, $1000 after. There was other stuff like ""pre-op exam"" for the ER this week and I cannot probably get our of my baseline ultrasound on Monday at 7:30 am.
Option #3  - (which is an option if the clinic choses to works with us) pushing as much money and treatment as we can, from what we already spent, towards IUI with Clomid (I am not even sure how would that work with the fact that I am on the bloody BC still). I believe that's about 7% success rate and 2k (our clinic, the only clinic in the state supported by our insurance, does Clomid only with monitoring and IUI for just that much), but after we get three bloody (heh) cycles done, we qualify for our insurance to pay the meds and probably still have enough money for IVF before we reach the cap.
I would definitely appreciate any thoughts. As I said, on a relative scale of problems, this is -2, but it really feels like too much today.

Whilst most clinic appointments have been as good as can be expected, I'm utterly appalled at the conditions that men have to put up with when it comes to providing a sperm sample on site - especially on egg collection day.

How any man, let alone one who's supported his partner through the stimming process, been at the clinic since early morning, and has the worry of his partner undergoing a surgical procedure, can be expected to ejaculate on cue in little more than a broom cupboard with no soundproofing and only dog-eared copies of Razzle for encouragement is utterly beyond me. That's not even considering the ridiculously tiny plastic pot.

It seems as if this 50% share of the embryo creation process is treated as little more than a necessary irritation. I know this may seem like a strong reaction, but given the vast amount of money charged for each cycle and the effort put into ensuring the best outcome for women, I can't believe that so little thought is given to the male partner's experience.

Of course the female partner has to go through the daily injections, intrusive scans, major physical and psychological side-effects and surgical procedures, and I'm not in any way diminishing this, rather I would've expected more effort to be made to support men. In my own experience, whilst undergoing IVF is way tougher than I could've expected, this is mitigated somewhat by the constant medical attention. My husband had to deal with his own stress about the process and look after me as well, but with only a fraction of the back-up.

I know that everyone's opinion of porn is different, but as a bare minimum I would've expected the provision of a private, comfortable room, a selection of new, decent mags and videos and an 'anatomically-accommodating' receptacle for the sample. I was definitely apprehensive about egg collection, but wouldn't have changed places with my husband for anything. 

Ultimately, I wish the clinics would grow up and accept that making babies is inextricably linked to sex, and enable both partners to have as stress-free an experience as possible.

Rant over. Thanks for reading.

I really look forward to hearing anybody's thoughts on this!

We are potentially going to be doing our next extraction on Thanksgiving. We'll see both our parents that day (in separate events), and we typically do the cooking for one of those events. So if I'm going to be recovering from an extraction, we'll have to provide advance warning.  

I'm wondering how you handle telling your parents about your IVF cycles. A bit of context: We got pregnant on our last cycle and had what my husband and I call a ""double miscarriage."" We had a lot of bleeding, an ER doc said we had a miscarriage, then a week later my fertility clinic said the pregnancy was fine. Then two weeks later we were told the embryo had stopped growing and had no heartbeat. So we told our parents we were pregnant, then told them we miscarried, then told them we were pregnant again, and then told them we miscarried again. All within about four weeks. So ... that was awful. 

With this cycle, I don't want to have a bunch of people waiting on our results. I don't want to feel like I have to give a report out to the entire Noodle clan. But lying is too difficult. Mr. Noodle (Lord Noodle?) thought we could just say I had the flu on Thanksgiving, but I don't think that will work.  

Thoughts? xoxo

I had my ER in mid-July with the intention of doing a FET with the next cycle.  In August, a hysteroscopy revealed an issue that needed to be surgically removed and turned out to be adenomeiosis.  My RE said I'd need to wait until the next cycle to give my uterine lining time to recover.  

During the September cycle, 2 days before my scheduled transfer date, my RE said she didn't like the character of my lining and that she wanted to be extra cautious given my pre-IVF miscarriage history.  She thought that maybe my lining still needed more time to recover from the surgery in August.  

Forward to October -- RE put me on a different protocol to theoretically help my lining.  I started with BCP, then added Lupron.  Then my ultrasound revealed that I was ovulating through.  RE canceled my cycle and said to continue on Lupron to hold my place in the protocol, then I can proceed to stim meds when I start my period.  That was 4.5 weeks ago.  Still no period.  I go in twice a week for scans and bloodwork.  The follicular cyst is still huge, but my estrogen levels finally started dropping -- then the estrogen kind of stalled around 100 (needs to be <50), so today, RE said we'll do a procedure next week to drain the cyst, which should help the estrogen continue going down.  

At this rate, we're looking at a mid-December transfer at earliest.  4 months of delays, but coming just a couple of weeks at a time.  Everything in my life has felt like it's on hold because we keep thinking the transfer is a short while away.  E.g., haven't booked a long weekend trip in case I start my period the night before we leave and then can't get into my RE's office until CD5.  We've decided that if there's another canceled cycle, we're taking a break for a few months, going on a proper trip, and letting my body recover from all the meds and miscarriages (my last normal cycle was in February -- since then, it's been chemical pregnancy, pregnancy until 11 weeks, D&C, IVF retrieval, start meds until cycle gets canceled, repeat last step 4x).

Anyone else have any of these issues?

**TL;DR**: Adenomeiosis, uterine lining had poor character, I'm a super-ovulator but my period refuses to start.  Anyone else?

My family is pretty big and pretty close. I have aunts on both sides of the family who struggled with infertility. Both sets of grandparents are aware of our TTC struggles. My four siblings have been pretty supportive and patient, two of them have children of their own. They aren't perfect and often say the wrong thing, but they do try to understand what I'm going through so I'm  proud of them for that. 

It has been almost two years since our last fertility-related doctor visit. Six years TTC, eight married, together 12 years this Sunday. We've spent the last two years saving up and working on ""us"" and are now finally ready to do our first round of IVF. I have unexplained IF, my husband's SA's have been normal every time.. maybe slightly below avg morphology but that's it. All the tests that have been done on me have produced no answers of any kind. Our dr is very optimistic that IVF + ICSI will work for us. I'm not allowing myself to be quite that hopeful, I've chosen to go into this as if it's another diagnostic procedure only. 

So I am conflicted about whether or not to tell anyone besides my parents that we are finally doing IVF. I would love to be able to surprise people with good news, but would of course hate to have to deliver bad news. I would love to have a little bit of privacy for once, to see how we do in going through this mostly on our own, and to be able to grieve privately if this attempt fails. But I would also hate to hurt anyone's feelings when they find out they've been kept out of the loop, when most of them have been so supportive and aware of me thus far. And with all the hormonal gunk that's going to be coming my way via the injections, I may find that I really need to be able to talk to my family about it. But we have holiday celebrations coming up, which will be held at my brother and SIL's home this year, and I don't know how I'd go about concealing the refrigerated meds in their fridge.

My husband and I have been trying for four years now...IVF, two FET, one chemical from a natural pregnancy, one miscarriage from the first FET, failed IUI.  We did all of the treatments at one clinic in Austin.  I am planning on doing IVF again with genetic testing and see if my eggs are normal (the miscarriage was a triploidy from me).

I am trying to decide if I should go to a different clinic in Austin or go out of state?  I had a consult with CCRM in Denver.  If I go out of state, I might as well research other top clinics.  What do you think are the best fertility clinics in the US?  I checked out the ratings but curious what y'all think!

Thanks for the advice :)

1.  Increase in my self awareness - I have never been a navel gazer always the ""doer"" in my family.  With that I have lost myself along the way - forgetting or possibly not knowing who I am.  I have had to take a long hard look in the mirror - which can be ugly and painful.  I have learned a lot of negative things about myself - mainly my controlling nature and perfectionist tendencies.  I have also learned I am a very strong person which I never felt that I was.  I have learned my limits and I have also learned the importance of boundaries.  I don't think I had much self worth in the past but the IF process has forced me to do some major self care as well as nurturing my marriage more - even if it is purely for survival, it has strengthened my relationship with not only myself but my closest loved ones.  

2.  It's heightened my sensitivity and empathy to others and the outside world.  Instead of snapping to judgements I take pause now when I pass strangers.  I wonder the struggles that person has endured or is currently enduring.  It makes me realize how resilient humans beings are.  I want to connect and nurture humanity more - its made me value what a miracle we all are and each one of us has a purpose on this Earth - no matter how insignificant we may feel.

3.  I have been forced to live in the here and now.  As a planner, organizer, the control freak I always knew I was just didn't realize how much so - I am realizing how naïve and stupid I really have been most of my life.  I have been too busy to enjoy the simple things in life.  I have been focused on end goals and results and not appreciating the gift of each day.  I have been missing the beauty around me.  That everything I plan for may not come to fruition and all that I have gained can be lost in a moments notice.  Its a scary realization although it forced me to slow down and lose some sense of entitlement.  

4.  Seeing the fear of change and the fear of stagnation.  I fear a failed cycle yet I also fear a positive one simultaneously.  As someone that has always idealized parenting and being a mom I know if I am blessed with a child the suffering and struggle with life will continue.  It will not end my problems.  I fear the changes that come but I also fear not having those changes if we don't succeed.  The stress will not end wherever the journey ends - which brings me back to the here and now.

5.  I am becoming more liberal and seeing less black and white in the world.  I see families come in all shapes and sizes.  Its not just about genes and blood relations.  Despite not having my own kids, I have my husband and my 2 golden retrievers.  I have friends that I consider family.  I have a community that is close and supportive - I enrich my friends' childrens lives as does my husband.  I am becoming more of a feminist.  I feel a stronger kinship to women and am happy we live in a time where we can be respected for our own decisions and autonomy.  I have deep respect for others that live a different life than what they have been told they should be living.  I love seeing people be authentic and comfortable taking the least walked path.  I respect individuality more and have been accepting of people with their warts and all.

A year of ttc with PCOS and no success lead us to discover, after months of a doctor insisting it was lab issues, that my husband has zero sperm.

**TL;DR:  Looking for any thoughts, experiences, insight, etc. about back-to-back retrieval cycles.  I just got my protocol for IVF #1, and my details are below, for anyone who's interested, or if that info is relevant to your options.  Thanks, all.**

Background:
*39 1/2 years old.  
*Had both tubes removed via salpingectomy on 10/2 of double hydrosalpinx.  
*Started bc on 10/3, and just received my protocol today.  
*Starting Ganirelix on 11/15 and will take that and the bc pills until 11/18.  
*First ultrasound and estradiol test on 11/19.  
*Begin stimming on 11/22.  Menopur (two powder vials) in the morning and Follistim (150 IU’s) in the evening for 8-14 days prior to retrieval.  
*Once my largest follicle is 12-14mm, I’ll take Ganirelix again every evening until Ovidrel trigger shot (this seems to be in addition to continuing the Menopur and Follistim).

*Likely retrieval between 12/1 and 12/7.

*AMH: 1.51 (first test in March was 0.4, but RE thinks that was wrong, a lab problem)
*FSH: 9
*Estradiol: 66
*Antral follicle count: 6 on right, 8 on left.

Okay, so for the back-to-back retrieval:

We are going through Attain and are purchasing their two-cycle plan.  But we are also doing PGS testing, which is a separate cost, and the fee is close to $3000 for up to eight embryos.  So one embryo or eight, we’re paying the same.  If we do back-to-back cycles/retrievals and send our best embryos from both those retrievals, we’ll be saving ourselves quite a bit of money (I’m not expecting eight viable embryos, but if by some miracle we get way more than expected, we’d send the best quality eight.)  

These are my thoughts on why this makes sense:

*I’m going to be 40 next April, so I feel like every month counts and the sooner we do this, the better.

*There’s a possibility we will relocate cross country sometime next year, and I’d rather not have to switch clinics for second IVF round.  

*I think I’d like to know exactly what we’re looking as to how many embryos we get and their quality, etc., rather than wondering what the second round will/would have yielded.  It sucks to have to wait so much longer for the PGS, but I think the trade off will be worth it.  

Questions:

*Has anyone else done this before?  What was your experience?  Problems?  Positives?  Outcome?

*How long did you have to wait between retrievals?

*I’m sure there are a ton of things I don’t know about yet/haven’t thought of, so I’d just appreciate any insight about this.  

Many thanks!

In that time a lot has happened, my autoimmune disease I have a new dr and new meds for now and is now under control, I've lost 20kg, we've had preliminary fertility testing done - he is fine, I have PCOS. 6 cycles of clomid with varied ovulation success. Since losing weight my irregular cycles have become regular & predictable in the last 8 months & I ovulate on my own. 

So things are looking better with me, but the longer this is continuing the worse my husband is at consistently being able to perform & ejaculate.

Years ago in a terrifying sex mishap we discovered he has a very tight foreskin - he had never had it retract past the head & didn't know it could until we had sex without a condom for the first time - the sheer terror in his eyes when he thought his penis was broken was awful!!! Funny now... Horrible that day. Anyways went to doctor who diagnosed moderate phimosis & gave him cream to loosen the skin and 'stretches' to do in the shower. We thought he was all good, but he still has some discomfort during intercourse.

Anyways during O time when we have sex more frequently it is becoming an issue, he feels the discomfort & it distracts him and he can't finish, probs 50% of the time. It's VERY frustrating!!!

So now I've been doing inseminatiom with a cup every time he can't perform (because he can get himself there... Annoyingggg), presseed  and a needless syringe because I feel like the regular consistent swimmers is what we need & I can't keep just feeling powerless

I have NO idea if the home insemination is that effective but I at least feel like I'm being proactive.

He is going to the doctor to deal with this again this weekend!

206,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"FULL BACKGROUND because why not. 

TTC on our own 1 year. Took 7 months to get RE appointment, get tests arranged (not a full-service clinic), schedule treatment. 

First diagnosis: MFI - 2% morphology due to Anti-Sperm Antibodies (and lowish count and motility). Nothing to do to fix the morphology. I was surging every month and seemed fine. No-one cared that my luteal phases were short (10-11 days post-surge).

First treatment: Two unmedicated IUIs. First resulted in small CP (13 at 13DPIUI, 26 at 15DPIUI, then fell). Second had nothing.

We move cities. Took a few months for testing and scheduling. Treatment cancelled when a fluke CP shifted my cycles too far for the small window I had in my school program to do IVF. Levels, days unknown: 35, 73, 120, 140, fell. 

We move cities again (yay). Took a few months for testing and scheduling. 

Second treatment: Short IVF cycle. Mild OHSS. 11 mature eggs retrieved, 9 fert, 2 Day 3 8-3 embryos frozen (some eggs had dark cytoplasm, some were multinucleated, some just arrested). It took 6 months for the fall out of that - one FET (beta simply negative), then delays, then second embryo did not survive thawing. 

Third treatment: 3 back-to-back unstimmed but progesterone-supported IUIs. Middle one had third CP, beta of 7 at 16DPIUI. 

Quick turn-around to fourth treatment: Long IVF protocol. Much easier recovery. 7 mature eggs, 7 fertilized, ALL multinucleated. Died off between Days 3 and 5. No transfer. 

Leading to Friday's follow-up. 

The doctor is stumped. She has no idea why I'm not making embryos with IVF. She's ordered karyotyping for both of us (which I asked for after the third CP and she dissuaded us since she doesn't consider CPs to be diagnostically relevant but does consider poor IVF response to be). She is very clear that she doesn't know why this is happening and she doesn't know what the best move is. 

I mentioned in the daily thread that she obliquely referenced donor eggs. It was very indirect but it put them on my radar. It was part of a speech about how they can't actually trace cause and effect in predictable ways 100% of the time: 

* She must have used a word like ""special"" or ""unique"" half a dozen times.

* They don't know why giving stims in small quantities to make a single follicle in women who ALREADY make single follicles does increase pregnancy rates. 

* She doesn't know general lifestyle-related ways of increasing my egg quality.

* She told a story of another patient to illustrate how they don't know why certain treatments work: This patient made PGSed perfect embryos no problem but could.not.get.pregnant. The thing that worked was switching to donor eggs. The doctor has NO IDEA WHY.

That last point was the oblique reference. The realization that if they can't solve the problem using the gametes we're giving them, they are going to suggest donor gametes because they don't know enough about fixing my gametes. 

I guess I had a mental block that it could be a female factor they couldn't solve because I've been ovulating on my own this whole time and have a huge egg reserve (42 on the Canadian scale) and I was an over-responder to 125IU of Gonal-F. I am just so stunned that my eggs could be unusable without some warning before now. 

I'm really upset that they don't know more about fixing egg quality. She told me I could visit a naturopath for further ideas. This did not sit well with me; I don't know how it works where I live but there are plenty of places where ""naturopath"" or even ""naturopathic doctor"" is not a protected term or is not held to any kind of standard. I lump naturopathy in with alternative medicine and homeopathy when it comes to self-policing by a body I can trust (and my attitude there is, if it worked, it would become real medicine, like how ""willow bark tea"" is aspirin). Just look at the fact that that woman who made her children suffer through whooping cough is allowed to call herself a naturopath. 

The worst part is that many things people say they go to naturopaths for are things I can get behind -- preventative medicine and treating our bodies better. Of course you feel like shit; you only eat prepackaged food and you sleep 5 hours a night. Try eating yogurt daily if you get yeast infections. Gargling twice a day has actually been found to reduce the frequency and length of colds in randomized trials. But also, GET FUCKING VACCINATED OR ELSE YOU ARE A DANGER TO SOCIETY. I just feel like that kind of stuff should be covered by a family doctor who is guaranteed to take a science-based approach and can look out for warning signs of something more serious. 

I pushed back immediately when she said I should see a naturopath to check my vitamin levels. I said ""I prefer my medicine to be science-based. If it's possible vitamins can be a factor in fertility, why doesn't that fall under the purview of a reproductive endocrinologist?"" She said it's because she just never studied it, and I could see a family doctor instead if I was more comfortable. 

So now I'm in the hell of unexplained. No idea of what's wrong, so no clear way forward. 

If we end up back at IVF, she said she would switch me back to the short protocol. Her definition of success is ONLY ""how many transferable embryos made it"" not ""how bad were the side effects"" or even some measure of egg count or quality. She would reduce the meds a bit to still try that ""concentrate the quality"" trick of lower egg counts, but I'm terrified of being so sick for so long again. 

But a) we're waiting on the karyotyping first, and b) I am not able to bring myself to spend that much money again so soon without exhausting other options by backtracking. I sort of tried to skip ahead to IVF to ""buy time"" but even if that's not working, I can't stop trying.

I got the feeling that she wouldn't continue to recommend IVF if we kept having such a crap response. Mr. mL didn't. He didn't feel different at all after the appointment; I feel completely destroyed. I thought that she would say ""just keep trying IVF while we try different protocols"" but her complete confusion was totally demoralizing.

**NEXT TREATMENT:** She's letting us go ""back"" to medicated IUIs which we have never tried. She's putting me on a teeny dose of Gonal-F to make a super-follicle but she'll still be aiming for a single follicle. We're even allowed to start before we get karyotyping back, which is good because this means we can squeeze in a cycle before Christmas. My Day 1 is any day now, so it looks like cycle, Christmas, next cycle by mid-January. We'll buy a three-pack of IUIs so that we can bash out a bunch of repeated attempts (being mathematicians, we have faith in medium odds; we just know that you might need to roll the die a bunch more to finally get it to turn up). We can get pregnant on IUIs (2 out of 5 worked!) so it'll be a case of seeing if we can get them to stick. 

I'm really anti-baby-dust and becoming anti-luck-wishing. I'll be very glad to have a sympathetic ear here, though, and I can't express how important it is to be not alone.

Does anyone have any helpful information on what we should be asking so that we can make our best decisions?  Here is the list of questions I have so far.

1.  If we go with IVF what is your position on single embryo transfer 

2.  When we are done with the process, if we have embryo's left over do you do compassionate transfer and what is the cost?

3.  What are your rates of ovarian hyper stimulation?

4.  Since I live out of town what is your relationship with your satellite clinics where I will be doing my monitoring?

5.  What are the costs associated with the protocol that you recommend?


For reference my husband and I live about an hour away from both clinics but they both offer monitoring in the town that we live in.  I'm in my early 30's with a child from a prior relationship and am in otherwise good health, we are choosing this course of action due to my husbands severe MFI.

I check her temperatures every day, compare her current graph with ones from previous months and from other women's too, and I desperately try to interpret every slightest change in temperature.

The experience has obviously helped me to better understand my wife's biology, and I think it has also given me a kind of illusion of being at least partially in control, as opposed to just keeping my fingers crossed for two weeks. However, I feel like I'm becoming too dependent on this, and a disappointing reading can sometimes ruin my whole day. I have come to a point where I feel that this practice may be doing me more harm than good, psychologically speaking.

I'm wondering if we should maybe stop recording her temperatures, at least for a while. I know for a fact she would not be against it. Would I be losing any useful information by discontinuing? I'm thinking the only really useful piece of data is the ovulation day anyway, and temperature shifts only show that when it's already too late anyway (which is why we use OPKs).

Are there any real benefits to recording basal body temperatures? Should we take a break?

On a completely unrelated note, today I helped a woman with a baby carry her stroller up the stairs. It made me feel slightly better. It's good to know this ordeal hasn't turned me into a completely bitter asshole yet.
