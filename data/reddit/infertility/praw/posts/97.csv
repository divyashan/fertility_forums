Here’s my infertility timeline: 

Currently 36 with well controlled type 1 diabetes, very regular cycles including ovulation, no blocked tubes, normal shaped uterus, uterine lining always above 8mm at transfer, no MFI issues, neither are carriers for genetic diseases, overall both are healthy

2015: I’ve never been pregnant. We begin trying to conceive on our own, no luck 

2016: three rounds of clomid with timed intercourse, no pregnancies; two IUIs, both unsuccessful

2017: another unsuccessful IUI, prep for IVF, which provided three PGS normal embryos; first failed transfer October 

2018: second failed transfer in February

2019: after having severe abdominal pain, Dr does u/s and finds 4mm endometrioma on my right ovary. Lap reveals silent stage 3/4 endo - surgeon says most of it is excised and all is well; also do an ERA showing me pre-receptive so another day of progesterone added to protocol

Nov. 2019: following new ERA-informed protocol and after endo excision, transfer #3 is unsuccessful

Jan 2020: Dr attributes recently failed transfer to fact it was the first one done after endo excision, so it’s like the first “real” good shot and odds are 33% in the best of first shot cases. Dr won’t put me on steroid to reduce inflammation due to my diabetes (he doesn’t believe it would make a difference anyway). I tested negative for natural killer cells and anti-phospholipid syndrome, etc etc. He doesn’t support reproductive immunology therapies.

Early March 2020: We do another retrieval resulting in 2 PGS normal embryos. 

July 16: We transfer a 6BA PGS-normal embryo and use Lovenox and baby aspirin to increase blood flow to uterus in addition to regular estrogen/progesterone protocol.

July 21: first positive hpt. 
July 23: Clear blue digital hpt shows positive
July 26: beta hell begins with beta 1 - 165
July 28, 48 hrs later: beta 2 - 187
July 31, 72 hrs later: beta 3 - 70.
Dr called with those last results and said he was sorry but we are losing the pregnancy. Dr explained that with endometriosis (even though it was excised in 2019) I’m at a slightly higher risk for ectopic pregnancy, but hopefully when they check my numbers next week they will have fallen to 0 so I won’t have to worry.

11,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here, but I've been a lurker for a few years. Just knowing this sub was here has been an amazing support as I struggled with news that I would be able to easily conceive and carry a child. Now, as my husband and I are moving from talking about children to actively trying, I thought I'd introduce myself.

I'm a 31F from Canada, with a 31M husband. I have a suspected case of PCOS and a very confirmed case of a rare genetic disorder. This disorder is multisystemic and has caused issues and surgeries for me in the past, but now I am largely able to manage it without medications and with minimal impact on my day to day life. I was diagnosed six years ago and realized the issues this would cause for my family planning about three years ago. My most largely impacted system is my kidneys, and I've previously had one mostly removed.

Although detection of genetic mutations for my illness is possible for 90% of cases, mine was one of the 10% where my mutation is unknown. This means no ability to select uneffected embryos. My disease is very rare, so I'd rather not name it, but suffice to say a child born with it could be relatively ""healthy"", like me, or severely disabled, with a very short life expectancy. Normally, people with my illness have a 50/50 chance of effected offspring, but it's possible the risk is higher. It's not a gamble my husband and I are willing to take.

To further complicate the issue, I have a number of issues due to my illness that will make any pregnancy high risk, the main one being the possibility that some existing benign tumors I have will grow, rupture, or metastasize and spread to other organ systems. There is so little research on my disease that it's nearly impossible to tell what the likelihood of this happening is. As far as we know, my husband is healthy, but we have been given paperwork for him to complete a sperm analysis and will be doing that this month.

In terms of where that leaves us, our goal is to have a pregnancy using IVF with donor eggs and my husband's sperm. To do so, I will need approval from all my specialists that pregnancy will be viable and relatively safe for me. We've just begun this process, reaching out for appointments with my neurologist, nephrologist, urologist, and gynecologist. My family doctor has also referred us to a reproductive endocrinologist. 

I know the main road blocks will be my own health as well as our ability to find donor eggs. I really don't want to use eggs from anyone we know. I know my limits and my faults and I'd be eaten alive with jealousy and insecurity. I'm already trying my best not to become overwhelmed with jealousy as friends, family members, and people I don't really like all that much have their first, second, third kids while all I can grow inside is more tumours. In Canada, this will make finding a donor very difficult, and we may need to look internationally. I'm open to this route, but given the current world climate, I don't expect that to be a simple process either. 

For now, I'm just looking to introduce myself and maybe hear from other people who can understand what an all-consuming struggle this already has been as I've coped with losing the chance at the simple pregnancy I always took for granted I'd have, and this will continue to be as we get started in earnest.

Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C""). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.

**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process.

I was perscribed letrozole for ovulation induction in July after taking a course of provera. The perscription was 2.5mg on CD 2-6 for three consecutive months. I took a course of letrozole in July days 2-6 and after doing multiple lh tests a day throughout the cycle, I didn’t have an lh surge at all. I am now on CD 29, cramping and thinking that my period is on its way.

I did my 21 day and 28 day blood tests, but without any warning my consultant has gone on holiday and isn’t able to review my bloods for ovulation until she is back at the end of August. I am certain that I didn’t ovulate and was thinking she would up my letrozole dosage for August. The consultants secretary has said that there is no one else who can review the tests results and I would have to wait until my consultant came back from leave. 

My question is, with my period most likely on the way and not being told to up my letrozole doseage, do I take the 2.5mg on days 2-6 again this month (as it was prescribed prior to bloods) or do I skip this cycle of medication as I’m certain I didn’t ovulate on the 2.5mg knowing that the consultant would have upped my dosage? 

I have absolutely no medical knowledge and feel like I have been left to make this decision without any information, so feeling upset and confused to say the least.

For anyone wondering, I have no PCOS or endometriosis diagnoses, no blocked tubes etc. and the infertility is thought to be purely due to anovulation. I’m 26 years old and there is no male factor infertility.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

40,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hope this is OK as a standalone post; if not, I'm happy to move to the daily treatment thread. I have searched the subreddit for posts on estrogen priming and not found anything useful, so decided to ask my question this way instead.

Egg-wise, my situation is DOR (and soon, POF!) due to Fragile X premutation: low AMH, high FSH, low AFC, poor responder. Historically, my best IVFs have been when my FSH just happens to be low on a given CD2. My new doctor, unlike my old one, has not pressured me to (over)suppress with BCP prior to starting stims and has only given me the go-ahead to start when my FSH is <13.5. In one way, this is great because it allows us not to waste \~$20k/ each on guaranteed-to-fail cycles. In another way, though, it presents a challenge for banking embryos, since even if I have success once (lol), by the time I'm ready for more IVF, I'll probably be in menopause.  

Back when we were interviewing clinics in our quest to escape the literal demon factory that is Weill Cornell, our current doctor suggested estrogen priming as a possible tactic in my case. Because we're already in debt, though, we're somewhat averse to experimenting — natural start w/ low FSH has worked better than anything else we've ever tried in terms of egg yield. OTOH, I do like and trust my current doctor and, from what I understand, estrogen priming can be very good for the DOR patient.

I have searched the subreddit for posts on estrogen priming and not found anything useful, so decided to ask my question this way instead.</p>

<p>Egg-wise, my situation is DOR (and soon, POF!) due to Fragile X premutation: low AMH, high FSH, low AFC, poor responder. Historically, my best IVFs have been when my FSH just happens to be low on a given CD2. My new doctor, unlike my old one, has not pressured me to (over)suppress with BCP prior to starting stims and has only given me the go-ahead to start when my FSH is &lt;13.5. In one way, this is great because it allows us not to waste ~$20k/ each on guaranteed-to-fail cycles. In another way, though, it presents a challenge for banking embryos, since even if I have success once (lol), by the time I&#39;m ready for more IVF, I&#39;ll probably be in menopause.  </p>

<p>Back when we were interviewing clinics in our quest to escape the literal demon factory that is Weill Cornell, our current doctor suggested estrogen priming as a possible tactic in my case. Because we&#39;re already in debt, though, we&#39;re somewhat averse to experimenting — natural start w/ low FSH has worked better than anything else we&#39;ve ever tried in terms of egg yield. OTOH, I do like and trust my current doctor and, from what I understand, estrogen priming can be very good for the DOR patient. </p>

<p>Anyway, after a third consecutive month of CD2 FSH around 20, I&#39;d like some advice. If you were in my shoes, would you keep waiting and doing CD2 labs every month until the magical low-FSH moment arrived? Would you do an estrogen priming protocol? Or is there some other option I&#39;m not thinking of? Thanks to all in advance.</p>

I recently saw a(BAD)RE who diagnosed me with DOR because I had a single borderline FSH number. He didnt seem to think I had PCOS for some reason. I requested retesting of FSH, Lh, testosterone, and added an AMH at my own request. My FSH is 6.9 upon retesting, and LH is about 4.7. My AMH came back as 4.425. At first I was ecstatic because it meant I called my RE’s bluff(he tried to sell me on egg freezing at my first appointment before retesting)and that I don’t have DOR. (Asshole.) But from my research my AMH is too high? The reference range on my blood work is way to broad in my opinion-in my age range it displays up to 16 ng/mL as “high normal” range. I swear I ovulate every month. I’m pushing for endometriosis surgery in Fall of this year, and I’ll request an AFC count since the office I’m going to is also an RE office.

56,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello everyone, 

Here’s my history in case that’s needed: I’m 30(F), a year into my infertility journey. 

I was diagnosed with Endometriosis in my ovaries, PCOS, a posterior body intramural fibroid, and they also found that I had a “myomatous uterus” but I’m not sure what that means. They found a tumor in my bladder that was cancerous, I had that removed and am being monitored for regrowth. Currently I am taking Metformin daily, and just completed my first IUI. Finding out results in one week - unless I get my period before then. 

In one of my ultrasound write ups there’s a note that says that there’s two large cysts cause by endometriosis (4.1cm and 1.5cm) and the large one is fused to my left ovary. I did an echovist and they found my left tube was open, but they couldn’t see my right tube. 

My RE is unconcerned with the issues - with the right tube, he said, just because you can’t see it doesn’t mean it isn’t there (? Yes.. but is it open or closed?) and said with the large endometrioma cysts, he doesn’t want to do invasive surgery as it damages the ovary, so just leave them. I went on Visanne for a few months to shrink them, and the big one did shrink to 3.6cm but it’s still attached to my ovary. Would this affect my fertility, especially since it’s my left one, and maybe the only tube that’s open? Who knows about the right tube.

He also said not to worry about my Endo right now, that getting pregnant will solve and fix all that, but talking to the people over at r/endo has told me that this is not true.

What would you do in my situation? Would you get the large cyst that is attached to the ovary removed? Should I do another echo to try and spot the right tube? Should I see an Endo specialist and put trying to get pregnant on hold for now?

Long story *kinda* short, I didn’t find out I was pregnant until I was 12 weeks. But due to my job/income there was no way I could have raised he or she. I asked the father about putting them up for adoption (I even found a really nice gay couple on American Adoptions) but he slapped me and said only an idiot would let somebody else raise their kid and abortion was my only option. I cut off contact then. I went to multiple places but was high risk and the doctors weren’t even sure if I did have it I would carry it to full term. I ended up having to wait until I was almost 17 weeks for the abortion at UCLA. I still have nightmares from the PTSD it’s caused me. 

That was over a year and a half ago. My periods have always been normal but I bled for 3 months straight after then never again for over a year so I got worried and went to the doctor last month. They did the two different ultrasounds and said something about fetal wreckage left over and it made me infertile since it was there for so long. 

I don’t know how to process this. 

I’m so sorry. I know many of you would love to have a baby and would never have an abortion. It was just my only option. But now I feel like I’m being punished for it, probably rightfully so. I’m 23 and got told I can never have a child. I don’t even feel like a woman anymore. What kind of man would even want me, you know? My whole future changed in the blink of an eye. 

Also my family doesn’t seem to understand how it’s affecting me. My mother keeps saying it’s not a big deal.. I can marry a man with kids, adopt, not even have kids etc...

After my 3rd miscarriage at 10 weeks, that came back genetically normal I started with a very well regarded fertility clinic in my town. I flagged that I was concerned I had an immunology issue, as I have eosinophilic eosophagitis, asthma and allergies.  I had started researching and asked about the Bondi Protocol (Prednisolone and Clexane). They told me it was not evidence based, and too risky. I was told I might have ""bad luck"" and to try again.

My fourth loss was early, only 5 weeks and again I raised taking immunosuppressants. Again I was informed another patient got cushings and there was no evidence based reason. Was told to try again and if it doesnt work try clexane.

I had another loss at 5 weeks followed by a hysteroscopy. I pushed to have my Natural Killer Cells tested. They informed me it was an expensive waste of time, not evidenced based and no point. I said do it anyway. 

Got my results today, not only did they come back positive but I'm in the highest category for NK cells so had I listened to them I'd be having another miscarriage no doubt. He presented the treatment plan to me as if I hadn't been asking for it for the last 6 months (surprise, its prednisolone! and clexane!) When i became visibly frustrated at having been dismissed for the last 6 months he said ""I see you're upset"" and then turned away from me and only addressed my husband for the rest of the session.

Basically, any problem we find we address. But nothing works. We’re headed to iui in October after two years and not even a false positive; however, in my immediate waiting for my period despair I am wondering how/if after 2 years of opks, timed sex, SMEP etc. iui will be better?

My husband and I (both 31) have been trying to have a baby for two years now. Over those two years I have used opks and timed sex, been diagnosed with hashimoto’s, which is being managed, discovered I have a potentially blocked tube(my re thinks it was just a muscle reaction preventing the dye from traveling because my hsg was so bad I almost passed out), SA all over the place in terms of numbers. Basically, any problem we find we address. But nothing works. We’re headed to iui in October after two years and not even a false positive; however, in my immediate waiting for my period despair I am wondering how/if after 2 years of opks, timed sex, SMEP etc. iui will be better?

I had 6 good looking follicles, but the only got 4 eggs. Out of those 4 eggs... none were mature.

I got my update today that they managed to mature 2 in the lab overnight and inject them with sperm. They are now waiting to see if the other two will mature. I don't know how long they wait to see if they'll mature. Last cycle I had 5 mature, 4 fertilized, but only 1 frozen (which didn't work).

Im new here! I been lurking for few days and decided to share my cycle/crazy journey. Ive been battling infertility for 3yrs. 

I have very abnormal/complicated infertility history...I started seeing an RE (2017) and began the medicated IUI & developed Angioedema during the cycle (anaphylactic reactions: swollen face, mouth/tongue) and had to do a lengthy work up for this phenomena, including frequent visits to the ER- or standby with Epi-pen incase my throat closed up. No one knew why I was having this reaction and the allergist/immunologist put me on Prednisone. 
After failed medicated IUI, RE wanted to change my treatment plan to Clomid & or just lower dose of Menopur (less aggressive) & began that process for 6 months....with mild Angioedema cases monthly. Each time it failed, I suffered Angioedema (bed ridden for a week) and back on Prednisone. 
To make this story short, I took Prednisone off and on for a year, saw 5 diff specialist only to have all the doctors puzzled with no explanation but “you have auto immune issues...which we havent figured out”. All the doctors said stop doing infertility treatment and you’ll live! Oddly true, Im totally fine if im not on any hormone manipulations. But, with my advanced childbearing age (39), with DOR/Low AMH, I kept pushing thru bc time wasnt on my side. I started Acupuncture 2x a week, took herbs,...& realized even Herbs made me swell (not as severe but def had reactions), so I switched TCM & switched to supplements. 

Fast fwd Fall 2019....I pulled the trigger and did conventional IVF (short protocol-FSH/menopur/cetrotide). Unfortunately, I was a poor responder (AFC 9, only 2 follicles grew, retrieved 3, 1 made to day 3 (grade 8A), fresh transfer failed & my body had severe reactions!! I was bed ridden for weeks and on all kind of meds and additional months of Prednisone. Mind you, being on Prednisone for a year makes you feel awful. Anyways, I suffered alot. I told myself i was going to live and took 8 months off. I started taking supplements, did acupuncture and changed my diet (eliminated dairy, gluten, sugar) and exercised almost every day (walked 3 miles) & rescued a dog (best decision!). 

Fast fwd to today, after having 3 consult with diff RE, I found a doctor who was intrigued by my case. I went in on day 1 of my cycle (AFC 9, AMH 1.3 (this went up from 0.64 being the lowest to 0.99 from April 2020) and so we started stim on this past Friday.

Currently taking 300iu GonalF, 100mg Clomid, Omnitrope(HGH), Melatonin 3mg and still taking supplements and acupuncture. Its been one hell of a ride in 3years but reading everyone’s stories on here gave me sense of belonging.

I teared up at the support and I'm very grateful to this community. I'm still fairly new to Reddit and mostly just lurk. I appreciate all your kindness.

We took many of your comments into consideration. We're still on our two month ""break"" and doing some research at ya'lls suggestion and looking at our finances. First I found another fertility clinic here and had an appointment with them for a second opinion. They looked over all my old IUIs and labs and ordered some new labs including a CA125. Mine was 18 (the other new labs were testosterone and TSH but they were both fine). The PA I met with said my CA125 results do support endometriosis. I'm both relieved and saddened by the news; I know that doesn't make sense, but I'm honestly just glad to have a little more definitive information and a reason to hardstop the IUIs. I don't think I want to do a scope at this time; aside from infertility I don't have any other issues with my period, so if IVF bypasses the endo issue, I don't think surgery is entirely necessary. 

She also wanted to rule out a uterine septum with another (more detailed) US. Apparently the HSG from the first clinic wrote ""slight heart shape"" or something on the report (but they didn't investigate that any further and we kept doing IUIs...). 

So we talked with her about IVF. My great fear is financial, but it looks like this clinic would be more affordable. We're going to sit down and compare the IVF reports for both clinics, the prices and our finances and see where we go from there. This clinic does look cheaper as they're willing to give me a discount via my employer which is a nice surprise, but it's still a lot of money. I like the PA better; she's very kind, detailed and through. The first doctor pushed IVF really hard really early (which I do understand, but I felt he could have checked me out a little more carefully before getting to that point). I'm feeling a little optimistic for the first time in a while. 

Being on break has been a nice reprieve from the constant rollercoaster of doctors appointments and meds.

About a month ago, my husband and I finally took the plunge and did a round of egg retrieval. We knew we had pretty severe male factor infertility going in, (700K sperm count, mostly malformed) due to medications he takes, so I was pleasantly surprised to get 4 PGS normal embryos and 1 mosiac out of the 16 eggs retrieved!  We have a recessive genetic condition called primary hyperoxaluria type II and my husband has Alports syndrome which is X-linked.  Therefore, we wanted male embryos as it would stop the ""chain"" of Alports (all girls would be carriers of Alports, boys are unaffected).  Of the 4 PGS normal embryos, all are unaffected for Hyperoxaluria, one is male.  The mosiac is also unaffected, and male. My RE is super pleased with the results as we only want one child.  I'm really wary- feeling that we only have one shot (the unaffected, PGS normal, male). 

Now, for my dilemma.  I had a HUGE (12cm) uterine fibroid removed in Dec 2016. My uterus has recovered, but I have a visible scar on the back of the uterus.  I already know I will be monitored very closely during pregnancy.  Hycosy and HSG both indicated the uterus was in great shape - no septum, clear tubes etc. In 2017, I asked my OB/GYN to check via vaginal ultrasound if there was re-occurrence of the fibroid. Instead he found an 2-3cm ovarian cyst.  We waited about 6 months (\~May 2018) and I had another ultrasound, which showed the cyst persisting. At that point I was told it's an endometrioma/ chocolate cyst and that I had stage III endometriosis!  My periods are regular and not very painful, though I do sometimes take an ibuprofen or two. I do tend to get diarrhea on CD1 and sometimes sex can be a bit painful if my husband is extra frisky, so I figured this must be related to the endo, and went about my life.   

The cyst was still there in 2019, but I was told not to have surgery to remove it as it might damage my ovary and that it was fine to stay there for IVF. 2019 was a mess work-wise so we didn't start thinking about IVF until March 2020 - then COVID. The clinic literally sent in my scripts and told me to wait for CD1 to call - then closed not even 3 days later, before my CD1!  When the clinic opened up again in June 2020, I had my ultrasound on CD1 to start my IVF cycle and the cyst is gone.  The RE looked for it during my monitoring ultrasounds and, since endometriomas/ chocolate cysts don't go away, he told me that it was a persistent corpus leuteal cyst and I was misdiagnosed with endo.  (I also want to mention that when the fibroid was removed in 2016 my OB/GYN mentioned that I did not have any signs of endo.)

My RE says the next step is a FET with the PGS normal male. Because I now don't have endo, he feels that a natural cycle start is best for me (less drugs, no injectables) and is confident the clinic can get me pregnant with one of the PGS normal embryos. I'm not so sure. What if I do have endo?  Should I be tested for it or undergo a laparascopy to look at everything? Should we do another IVF cycle to get more boys in the bank?

The RE looked for it during my monitoring ultrasounds and, since endometriomas/ chocolate cysts don&#39;t go away, he told me that it was a persistent corpus leuteal cyst and I was misdiagnosed with endo.  (I also want to mention that when the fibroid was removed in 2016 my OB/GYN mentioned that I did not have any signs of endo.)</p>

<p>My RE says the next step is a FET with the PGS normal male. Because I now don&#39;t have endo, he feels that a natural cycle start is best for me (less drugs, no injectables) and is confident the clinic can get me pregnant with one of the PGS normal embryos. I&#39;m not so sure. What if I do have endo?  Should I be tested for it or undergo a laparascopy to look at everything? Should we do another IVF cycle to get more boys in the bank? I see all the posts about ERAs and multiple failed FETs and I&#39;m getting very nervous.  HELP! (And thanks for reading my book!)</p>

I triggered with Lupron both times. Well, despite being on a lower dose of stims as compared to my first retrieval, my body went into overdrive and I ended up with over 30 eggs. Not surprisingly, as I’ve read that lots of eggs can be a bad sign as to maturity and quality, a lot of them were not mature and could not be fertilized.  I ended up with only a handful of additional Day 1 embryos than my first round where a lot fewer eggs were retrieved, but I still got a good number of embryos.  My question is - does it really matter that I had such a low rate of maturity? Would that affect the quality of the eggs (and resulting embryos) that were mature? Is it a sign that the other eggs that were able to be fertilized are of poor quality? I looked at the Hunger Games Spreadsheet and it looks like most women there did not have such a steep drop off from retrieved eggs to mature eggs, but for the women who got a decent number of embryos (say, 10 or more), they seemed to be able to get at least one or two PGS normal embryos so that gives me some hope.

Background: For my FET cycle, on CD16, my lining measured at 9.5mm. The next day I started progesterone (PIO) injections. I didn't go back for blood work and scan until the day before my transfer, which was 4 days after starting progesterone. My lining had compacted to 6.7mm. I was disappointed until the RE explained that this is good sign.

So, the scientist inside me started researching...  Apparently, compaction of the uterine lining is an indicator that the lining is ready to receive an embryo. If compaction is not seen, it is beneficial to continue injections until observed. And it seems to correlate with the ERA test results.

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”.

If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

131,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi All,

I’m new to this subreddit as I’ve realized recently I feel the most connection to the posts here than in some of the other Ttc related groups. I tried posting a lot of the below in the ttc after loss group, but no one responded. Hope you don’t mind me reaching out here as well.

The big thing on my mind these days is needing a hysteroscopic metroplasty, and honestly, just hearing about others who may have needed this/gone through this would be helpful for my anxiety. 

So for some context: my husband and I have been trying to conceive since April 2019. In that time I’ve had two missed miscarriages (one still lingering), all of the bloodwork an OBGYN and RE wanted me to do, my husband and I have both had karyotyping done, I’ve had over 15 vaginal ultrasounds, and I’ve gone from being looked at as a healthy woman, to the woman with the “interesting” uterus, and the woman who keeps ending up in the statistically unlikely groups for every scan/test/etc. 

Considering my uterus: My new RE wants me to have a hysteroscopic metroplasty done to fix my uterine abnormality (it had always been diagnosed as bicornuate, but she says it's septum...or somewhere in between where there’s something to fix?) as the first step once this miscarriage is done. She believes it is responsible for my two back to back MMCs that each happened in the first trimester. She’s not really willing to consider it might have been anything else at this point. 

I had my first MMC in Dec 2019 and my second in May of this year. Despite my OBGYN saying the misopristol was successful back in May after a followup ultrasound, according to my RE now that I'm 11 weeks out from the meds and an extra dose of misopristol later, my miscarriage is still not complete.

So I'm benched from proceeding forward while waiting for this loss to hopefully complete itself on its own and then until a cycle after the hysteroscopic metroplasty from what I can understand. 

This may sound naive but it really scares me to get this procedure. it's hard to find good information and honestly my doctor is competent but not the most forthcoming about what the procedure will be like as she just wants me to give my body another 4-5 weeks to try and pass the pregnancy before she'll even start discussing scheduling, anesthesia options, etc. for the surgery. 

So any information, experiences (ideally good vs horrible), if you were awake or fully under general anesthesia, etc. would be appreciated. I’m a bit scared of general anesthesia but I think that’s really the only option from what my doctor makes this sound like. And with my job, anything more than a same day turn around from the procedure isn’t something I can afford timing wise starting in Sept, so as I’m stuck not being able to even start scheduling until this lingering tissue is gone, it most likely means I won’t be able to schedule this procedure until December at the earliest (and as this doctor is 1.5 hours away and in the winter roads close, it could be closer to spring next year until I can have this procedure and possibly start trying again).

So being left to wait in anxiety for months without information is an isolating feeling, and knowing that I’m not alone in this struggle (even if it’s not really the same), would be great. I've been feeling really depressed so just feeling a sense of community is honestly what I want from this post I guess, even though I’m asking some specific questions. 

Thanks! ❤️

As soon as the procedure was over, I was informed the doctor had retrieved 18 eggs so I was ecstatic. A few hours later in the afternoon, I get a call from my fertility clinic and I was a little shocked to hear my RE's voice. She asked me how I was doing and immediately informed me that the anesthesiologist from this morning had tested positive for COVID-19. Their concern was that he touched my arm to put the IV and he touched my face when he removed my face mask to put the oxygen line. I also laid exposed in the OR without a mask, albeit with my own oxygen supply, all through my 20-30 minute procedure.

I've been super good about cutting off the rest of world since March especially because I was about to start IVF. I'm in Texas so stuff is real bad down here. My only outings are curbside grocery pick up and to go see my fertility doctor. So, I was in shock when I got the news and I didn't really ask questions. The doctor did tell me that the anesthesiologist was asymptomatic but only got tested because his kid had a small cough.

I'm very upset now that I've had time to digest and fully process this information. Why was the anesthesiologist there in the first place? My assumption is that he tested a few days ago and was waiting for his COVID-19 results which he got today. I've not heard of 2-3 hour turnarounds on COVID-19 testing. If that's the case, he should have stayed home.

The doctor advised me to quarantine from my family for 14 days. This is going to be super difficult.

Honestly, I don't know what the point of this post it. I guess I just want to give you all a heads up. I know exposure to COVID-19 is inevitable, but I trusted my fertility clinic to take better measures. Take care out there!

ETA: The anesthesiologist was wearing proper PPE. Also, thanks to everyone for providing their insights. I didn't know that there are actually quick COVID-19 tests available!

A few hours later in the afternoon, I get a call from my fertility clinic and I was a little shocked to hear my RE&#39;s voice. She asked me how I was doing and immediately informed me that the anesthesiologist from this morning had tested positive for COVID-19. Their concern was that he touched my arm to put the IV and he touched my face when he removed my face mask to put the oxygen line. I also laid exposed in the OR without a mask, albeit with my own oxygen supply, all through my 20-30 minute procedure.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been super good about cutting off the rest of world since March especially because I was about to start IVF. I&#39;m in Texas so stuff is real bad down here. My only outings are curbside grocery pick up and to go see my fertility doctor. So, I was in shock when I got the news and I didn&#39;t really ask questions. The doctor did tell me that the anesthesiologist was asymptomatic but only got tested because his kid had a small cough.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very upset now that I&#39;ve had time to digest and fully process this information. Why was the anesthesiologist there in the first place? My assumption is that he tested a few days ago and was waiting for his COVID-19 results which he got today. I&#39;ve not heard of 2-3 hour turnarounds on COVID-19 testing. If that&#39;s the case, he should have stayed home.</p>

<p>The doctor advised me to quarantine from my family for 14 days. This is going to be super difficult.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t know what the point of this post it. I guess I just want to give you all a heads up. I know exposure to COVID-19 is inevitable, but I trusted my fertility clinic to take better measures. Take care out there!</p>

<p>ETA: The anesthesiologist was wearing proper PPE. Also, thanks to everyone for providing their insights. I didn&#39;t know that there are actually quick COVID-19 tests available! I am very grateful that my doctor called me to let me know the situation so I can take precautions around my family despite the crappy situation!</p>

A little background: We are 32 and 34, with no known issues (so far.) Started with two IUIs back in 2019 that failed. 

1st cycle IVF with ICSI - 5 mature eggs retrieved. Only 1 fertilized, which stopped dividing at day 4. We held onto it until day 6 but unfortunately, no progress so it was discarded.

2nd cycle IVF with ICSI - 5 mature eggs retrieved. 1 fertilized normally, whereas 2 fertilized abnormally (too fast. 3 cell on day1 when it's supposed to be 2 cell.) Unfortunately, the 1 normal stopped progressing on day 2 and the other abnormal embryos still developed too fast so all was discarded on day 3.

My doctor was quick to assume that it may be an egg quality issue as she said it's very rare that two back to back cycles produces no fertilization, but nobody knows for sure. She's speaking to the embryologist today to see if they can figure out the problem.

Has anyone had a similar experience?

179,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello all,

I'm new to Reddit, new to this forum and am looking for some ideas/feedback/advice.

I have had 2 identical miscarriages with PGS tested embryos through IVF. With the first, the transfer was successful. We heard a heartbeat at around 6 weeks. The next week, I went back into the clinic for bloodwork and ultrasound, and the ultrasound revealed that the heartbeat had slowed to half of what it had been the previous week. One week later we went back in and the heartbeat was gone.

Four months later, we did another transfer. This time, before the transfer, I was treated for endometritis (2 weeks of antibiotics), had intravenous immunoglobulins before the transfer and then again 3 weeks later (I had a natural killer cells test that came back high, even though I don't know that the science is good to support this), and went on steroids and blood thinners. Again we had success and heard a heartbeat at 6 weeks but then at 7 weeks, the heartbeat had slowed to half and then 3-4 days later it stopped. Identical miscarriages.

I have done 4 retrievals and got 3 embryos from the 2nd retrieval only. All other embryos have come back abnormal. I've done a hysteroscopy (normal), blood doppler scan of uterus (normal), hysterosalpingogram (normal), saline ultrasound (normal), recurrent blood panel (normal). Before the second miscarriage, my TSH levels came back high, so I went on levothyroxine, but my RE is convinced that that was not the issue. We have met with RI who has suggested no exercise if successful, meditteranean/all organic diet, no coffee...

I'm weighing my options now. We are considering 1) one last retrieval with a different hormone protocol (Clomid instead of Lupron), 2) transferring remaining embryo and if that doesn't work looking at donor eggs, 3) transferring remaining embryo and if that doesn't work looking at adoption.  I am on the fence about doing another retrieval because it's expensive, I'm 43 and it hasn't been very successful. Plus we are no closer to knowing what is causing the miscarriages. I'm thinking that maybe it's better to save the money and use it toward donor eggs, which I'm not opposed to.

I have an appt this week with my RE to ask about thyroid disease, ERA biopsy, Receptive DX, hydrosalpinx, DNA fragmentation (sperm),  CD 138 Biopsy, dexamethasone, selenium. Am I missing anything?

I guess I'm wondering if anyone out there has had a similar experience where their miscarriages were identical. I am not an MD but I have a hunch that there is something autoimmune going on but who knows!?

I'm also wondering if it's even worth going the donor egg route if my body will reject the embryos.

Any advice/suggestions/hunches/commiserating is welcome. I'm sorry if you are going through this too. It really is the worst.

<p>I&#39;m also wondering if it&#39;s even worth going the donor egg route if my body will reject the embryos.</p>

<p>Any advice/suggestions/hunches/commiserating is welcome. I&#39;m sorry if you are going through this too. It really is the worst. Thank you!</p>

192,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"The Mod Squad would like to make a clarification around language in r/infertility based on some questions about appropriate terminology we have seen raised the past few weeks and that have been a recurring theme for years.

As you know, some terms and acronyms are disallowed in the sub and will trigger an Automod response asking for an edit. The list of banned terms can be found [HERE.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/bannedterms?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=infertility&utm_content=t3_exx2x3).

Other terms and phrases are more difficult to ban directly because they come up in the course of regular conversation but there are contexts in which they are not appropriate for the sub, and where continuing to use this language after reminders that it bothers other posters flaunts our “be compassionate” rule as well as the safe community we seek to foster here.

One of the most common such terms is “natural” to refer to a spontaneous pregnancy, unassisted conception attempts, or unmedicated & semi-medicated embryo transfer cycles. Many posters here believe that the use of this wording implies (sometimes inadvertently) that use of assisted reproductive technology or other interventions and certain medications to conceive is “unnatural” or “artificial.” Keep in mind that many of us have a visceral reaction to this language because we have had the word “natural” weaponized toward us - whether that is in the context of the use of ART to conceive or in another context, such as those of us who never had the option to have sex to make a baby and the judgment many of us have faced for that. The word “natural” has a long history of being used to alienate, mistreat, and discriminate against people who don’t fit a certain mold. The same is true for phrases like “trying the old fashioned way,” which frames non-sex forms of conception as “other” (and can also be interpreted to be shaming of non-heterosexual sex.)

**Here are some alternatives we suggest (not an exhaustive list):**

“trying without intervention,” “trying without assistance,” “unassisted,” “via intercourse,” “via sex” (yes you’re allowed to say sex!), “spontaneous pregnancy,” “spontaneous conception,” “free sex baby,” “unmedicated embryo transfer,” “semi-medicated FET.” 

We recognize this language does not bother every person with infertility, but given the amount of feedback we have received about this terminology over the years we do ask that you avoid using it. We also ask that people receiving feedback on their word choice behave graciously as long as the responses you’ve gotten are polite and matter of fact. **The fact you you personally are not hurt by this language is not an acceptable response to such feedback.** We know that there is no one size fits all opinion. We also urge you to stop seeing these gentle corrections as admonitions from someone who has taken “offense” to your word choice. There is a difference between being offended (resentful or annoyed, typically as a result of a perceived insult) versus being hurt (to cause bodily or mental pain or distress). Please keep in mind that the individual pointing out an issue with word choice may not even be themselves hurt by this, but rather acting on behalf of those they know who are (or a mod, responding because we have received reports on a post.) If we get hung up on the ""causing offense"" thing and forget that there's a more vulnerable group of people that are actually hurt or injured by the language we miss the opportunity to learn and adjust our potentially hurtful behavior. Our sub strives with these norms and with all of our rules to create a safe space and this is a big part of that. 

We are a community of people in which it is an acceptable norm for longer-term posters - and any poster really! - to make gentle corrections and reminders. This is a part of what makes the spirit of this sub and this community so wonderful. We have no interest (and frankly no time) in moderating people getting snippy about others raising a gentle point about their word choice. We were all new here once and each of us has learned a lot from one another about what feels respectful or hurtful. It can be embarrassing to feel like you’re being corrected but that doesn’t make the correction “bullying.” If you are feeling that way simply take a step back until you can respond (or not) with a clear head. The teaching and learning that we do here is a gift that makes each of us better participants in this place. 

Thanks to all of you for keeping this a safe and welcoming space.

- The Mod Squad",t2_vtdtf95,False,,0,False,PLEASE READ: Clarification of appropriate language in r/infertility,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_hvzicz,False,dark,0.96,,public,142,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mod Note,False,142,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1595472438.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>The Mod Squad would like to make a clarification around language in <a href=""/r/infertility"">r/infertility</a> based on some questions about appropriate terminology we have seen raised the past few weeks and that have been a recurring theme for years.</p>

<p>As you know, some terms and acronyms are disallowed in the sub and will trigger an Automod response asking for an edit. The list of banned terms can be found <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/bannedterms?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=infertility&amp;utm_content=t3_exx2x3"">HERE.</a>.</p>

<p>Other terms and phrases are more difficult to ban directly because they come up in the course of regular conversation but there are contexts in which they are not appropriate for the sub, and where continuing to use this language after reminders that it bothers other posters flaunts our “be compassionate” rule as well as the safe community we seek to foster here.</p>

<p>One of the most common such terms is “natural” to refer to a spontaneous pregnancy, unassisted conception attempts, or unmedicated &amp; semi-medicated embryo transfer cycles. Many posters here believe that the use of this wording implies (sometimes inadvertently) that use of assisted reproductive technology or other interventions and certain medications to conceive is “unnatural” or “artificial.” Keep in mind that many of us have a visceral reaction to this language because we have had the word “natural” weaponized toward us - whether that is in the context of the use of ART to conceive or in another context, such as those of us who never had the option to have sex to make a baby and the judgment many of us have faced for that. The word “natural” has a long history of being used to alienate, mistreat, and discriminate against people who don’t fit a certain mold. The same is true for phrases like “trying the old fashioned way,” which frames non-sex forms of conception as “other” (and can also be interpreted to be shaming of non-heterosexual sex.)</p>

<p><strong>Here are some alternatives we suggest (not an exhaustive list):</strong></p>

<p>“trying without intervention,” “trying without assistance,” “unassisted,” “via intercourse,” “via sex” (yes you’re allowed to say sex!), “spontaneous pregnancy,” “spontaneous conception,” “free sex baby,” “unmedicated embryo transfer,” “semi-medicated FET.” </p>

<p>We recognize this language does not bother every person with infertility, but given the amount of feedback we have received about this terminology over the years we do ask that you avoid using it. We also ask that people receiving feedback on their word choice behave graciously as long as the responses you’ve gotten are polite and matter of fact. <strong>The fact you you personally are not hurt by this language is not an acceptable response to such feedback.</strong> We know that there is no one size fits all opinion. We also urge you to stop seeing these gentle corrections as admonitions from someone who has taken “offense” to your word choice. There is a difference between being offended (resentful or annoyed, typically as a result of a perceived insult) versus being hurt (to cause bodily or mental pain or distress). Please keep in mind that the individual pointing out an issue with word choice may not even be themselves hurt by this, but rather acting on behalf of those they know who are (or a mod, responding because we have received reports on a post.) If we get hung up on the &quot;causing offense&quot; thing and forget that there&#39;s a more vulnerable group of people that are actually hurt or injured by the language we miss the opportunity to learn and adjust our potentially hurtful behavior. Our sub strives with these norms and with all of our rules to create a safe space and this is a big part of that. </p>

We just got the news that IVF cycle #1 was not successful.  I was taking folistim and menopur, with ganarilix about half way into the cycle.

I cried and begged for her to do something for over an hour, but there was nothing but stillness. This can't be happening again.. My husband used the doppler and it only showed my heart rate. We rushed to the hospital knowing deep inside that she was already gone. I delivered her the next day and the doctor showed us the super tight knot in the umbilical cord, a true knot.

Is this some kind of sick joke? 

2 years ago, I had a stillborn son at 24 weeks. 9 months later, we found out it was due to an x-linked mutated gene that was passed on to me from my mom. She had multiple losses that could not be explained until they finally did whole gene sequencing with my loss. I of course had to do ivf to exclude the embryos with that particular gene. From 26 embryos tested, we got 5 normals (pgt-a and pgt-m). 

We transfered the best embryo and it stuck. I honestly thought I would be referred to a high risk ob but no. I had an ultrasound at 7 weeks and I wanted more before the 20 week one, but they all kept insisting that there is no need for that. I was considered like any other 29 year old since the problematic gene was eliminated.  

Fast forward to now: my rainbow ivf baby is dead. What is going on? What have I done? Why didn't I push for more testing (when I know that really there was no need for it)? A true knot? Really?? Have I not gone through enough?

213,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all! I’m new here and thought I’d introduce myself. I apologize for the long post!

My husband (33m) and I (32f) have been trying to conceive for the better part of our marriage. We got married in December 2016 and I went off birth control in April 2017. At first, we were just casually seeing what happens, but as the months went on and a nothing happened, we bought some OPKs and gave it a more serious go. Nothing happened and I complained to my GP about it for months and he kept saying I should lose weight and improve my diet, and it would happen. He never really helped look into any other issues. I’m definitely overweight by about 50lbs for my height, but I try to keep active and eat nutritous food. The majority of my weight gain came from my low thyroid that was undiagnosed for a while. I have been on varying levels of synthroid since 2015 but I haven’t really been able to get the weight off. It’s been hard. 

My cycles started getting crazy in the spring of 2019. The days of bleeding kept getting longer and longer, to eventually I bled for 5 months straight. No one could tell me why. By chance, I saw a female doctor who was filling in for my GP and she immediately referred me to a fertility clinic. We got the whole work up and I came back with an AMH of about 6, and suspected endometrioma on my ovary and of course my thyroid issue. My husband had a very high count (150million) but slightly low motility at 34%. He started taking some supplements. I had a hysterosonogam and was told my tubes were open and my uterus looks good. The doctor did not want to do a lap to confirm the endometriosis as he felt it would do further damage to my ovary.

Fast forward to 2020, we were going to start our recommended treatment of Letrozole + Ovidrel + Endometrin, but then COVID hit and we had to wait. I was finally able to do my first cycle starting near the end of June. Everything was looking great, I had two follicles, one measuring 18mm and one 20mm. The only issue was in my initial bloodwork, they mentioned that my TSH was a 5. I immediately called my GP and got a higher synthroid prescription. Yesterday I went in for my HCG and it came back negative.

I think I’m more disappointed than I should be. I know it takes most people plenty of cycles to get it a positive, if at all, and I shouldn’t expect it to happen right away, but I feel like in the back of my mind I was hoping we’d just need this medication to nudge us in the right direction and it would work. Unrealistic, I know. 

I’m worried now about WHY it didn’t work. Is my thyroid too unstable? Is my endo causing problems with implantation or egg quality? Was it just a fluke? Is my husbands sperm still not quite where it should be? 

My infertility has been causing me to become quite anxious and I’ve been feeling paralyzed with fear/anxiety since the negative result. I know we just need to keep trying and I need to just make sure my thyroid is in check. I just can’t believe how slow this process has been, and there’s no end in sight. 

I know many of you have gone through similar or much worse, but I just felt like I needed to share. My husband and I are trying to keep our issues fairly private and I just needed somewhere to go.

Because my partner and I are not actively trying to conceive, it’s been difficult to have doctors take me seriously. I apologize if I am overstepping, since I do not have a diagnosis -but I am hoping that someone will still see the value in me reaching out in order to prevent some potentially devastating issues. 


I am currently working towards a diagnosis of PCOS but my doctors as of now haven’t even mentioned the possibility of POF. while it is more  likely I have PCOS- irregular/long cycles, hitriusm, high lh/fsh ratio. I am very worried I may have POF. I have a lot of the symptoms (which seem to overlap a little with PCOS) but some are unique. According to my bbt and now the bloodwork I received it doesn’t look like I am ovulating. I also had a miscarriage 18 months ago. Since I wasn’t trying to have a baby my doctor told me it wasn’t worth investigating. After tracking bbt and educating myself I finally demanded I get specific bloodwork done, as I want to know if I am ovulating. Regardless if I want to have a child or not (which I do in the near future).

I just got my bloodwork done (3rd day of cycle) and am waiting to get them interpreted by an RE that I’ve never been to. After extensive research.. all my bloodwork looks normal besides my lh and fsh. 
My lh was 36 on day 32 of my cycle. After these tests (day 3) it was still a little high at 14.1. My fsh was 5.8 and my estrogen was a little high at 72.5.. but still fell within “normal” range. My progesterone seemed a little low at 0.3.
All my androgens came back normal and so did all my vitamin levels. 

I obviously know I’m not a doctor and can’t diagnose myself. Which is why I’m working with a few specialists after this bloodwork from my pcp. 

I don’t want any doctor to overlook the possibility I may be going through POF. I’m 26, and have had symptoms for several years. I want to have a baby within the next few years and know that  timing is of the essence when it comes to my fertility. I know that amh along with fsh/estrogen can be a good indicator and I don’t seem to have any of those markers. 
According to my understanding, amh is pretty constant. So my question is can an amh of that high be indicating cysts and not acutely viable follicles/eggs?

Would like to create a thread that details any diets, practices, and/or supplements that have helped lower FSH.

Been doing IVF for over a year, but now do mini, with very minimal stims. Did one Shanghai protocol and things have been a mess since.

After our 4th MC in June, our RE has officially told us he can’t think of any more tests or treatments to try and that we should consider a gestational carrier. This absolutely devastated us. I really don’t know if I have the emotional or mental strength to watch someone else carry my child (not to mention the finances). We are looking into getting on a waiting list for a Reproductive Immunologist - but is it worth it or are they likely to tell us the same thing? Below is a bit of background on our pregnancies, the tests we’ve had and the treatments we’ve tried - does anyone see anything we may have missed or have any thoughts?


1st pregnancy: Conceived naturally right after taking out nexplanon BC, miscarried naturally at 6w5d after seeing a normal US with heartbeat. *side note: When I was 18 I was put on Yaz (I was only on it for 1 month and had to stop due to intense side effects) - with all the lawsuits over it I thought it might be worth mentioning.*

2nd pregnancy: Result of FET (2nd IVF cycle), had SBH, miscarried naturally at 6w3d ( the whole MC took almost a month after the loss because Cytotec caused the bleeding to stop at 2 weeks post MC and took another 2 weeks to start naturally again), after a normal US with a heartbeat.

3rd pregnancy: Result of a fresh transfer (4th IVF cycle), had SBH but it was healing well, required a D&C, loss was at 6w1d after a normal looking US, but heart rate measured low and there was a potential double yolk sac. Had the baby tested - came back normal.

4th pregnancy: Result of FET (5th IVF cycle), had way more pregnancy symptoms that I did with the other 3, loss was at 6w1d (but was found in week 8) after a normal US with strong heartbeat. When the loss was discovered the heart had already stopped and a 2nd yolk sac had formed at some point. A D&C was done and we had the baby tested again - and again the results came back normal.

Tests:

* Thyroid - normal
* Autoimmune - normal
* Clotting - normal
* B12 - normal
* Laparoscopy/Hysteroscopy - small amount of endo, but was told it wouldn’t have had any affect on our pregnancies or caused our losses. Everything else looked normal no physical abnormalities.
* Vitamin D3 - low and was put on supplements to correct, was told this would not have caused our losses.
* Iron/Ferritin - Low, had 5 once weekly infusions to correct, was told this would not have caused our losses.
* Prolactin - normal
* AMH - normal
* Karyotyping - normal
* Genetic screening - normal
* Semen Analysis - normal
* DNA Frag - normal


Treatments we’ve tried (our last protocol included all of this in the same cycle):

* Progesterone
* Estrogen
* Baby aspirin
* Vitamin D3
* Ferrous Sulfide (Iron)
* Doxycycline
* Prednisone
* IV Intralipids
* Neupogen wash
* Lovenox
* HCG boosters (this was the only thing not included in our last protocol, but we have done it before)

All my tests say we should be able to conceive and carry a healthy baby with no issue, but that’s not what is happening. My RE seems completely stumped and recommends a GC at this point, but I can’t seem to swallow that pill. I just don’t see how we keep losing them. How can our losses be so consistent, but we can’t find a reason?! Is there something we missed? Would a reproductive immunologist potentially give us more insight (we have none in our area so we would have to travel to see one, but want to know if it’s worth it before we do).

Almost two years ago, I found out about my hydrosalpinx from an HSG. It took me a while to cope with these findings and I found myself crying most days. A year ago I finally saw the specialist to schedule the unilateral salpingectomy/possible repair and next week I finally have the surgery.

I am really anxious, and am hoping to hear about some other experiences if anyone is willing to share what it was like, what recovery felt like and what to expect. We have to travel to get to the hospital and stay in and airbnb, so I'm a little bit anxious about being too sore or uncomfortable to drive home in a timely manner.

I wanted to [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/g51rid/introduction_advice/) the community on our diagnosis in case someone down the line has similar initial concerns or test results. I hope this is okay as a standalone post. It doesn't quite fit as treatment or chat and I'm asking for advice. **The long and short of it is that we are moving on to IVF with IMSI and CCS due to MFI of unidentified cause and a pericentric inversion.**

The pericentric inversion is not suspected to be the cause of my husband’s abnormal SA results (count < 1M, no normal morphology). Hormone levels, micro deletion, and chromatin fragmentation are normal or great. My husband had a minor varicocele and hydrocele but two urologists agreed that these were not significant results.

On my end, I had an endometrial biopsy (normal), HSG (bilateral free spill, arcuate uterus), full CBC and metabolic panels (normal), and day 3 labs (FSH 5.6, LH 7.6, AMH 3.61). My baseline ultrasound showed an arcuate uterus, a tiny, non-interfering fibroid, 23 total developing follicles, and a borderline thin lining.

After speaking with a genetic counselor, our inversion is not expected to impact the health of potential offspring. All the DNA is present, just flipped. However, because of how semen DNA splits, the inversion can cause aneuploidy. All of this is to explain why we are moving forward with our own semen and will do CCS (or PGT-A) testing.

Now comes the financial, emotional, and logistical decision. I’m approximately mid-cycle (I stopped tracking anything but my period start/end). I could go ahead and start birth control on my next cycle with our current clinic (CCRM). However, the total cost for a single retrieval and FET (without medications) is quoted as $23k. The doctor said we have a 70% chance of success but how he is getting to that number is currently an open question. We’re paying completely out of pocket and it terrifies me to spend that amount knowing that the first cycle is usually diagnostic. If we qualify, the shared risk program (3xIVF, unlimited FET) costs $39,500.

I’ve reached out to a couple other clinics in the US near family that do shared risk or lower cost programs (Shady Grove, CNY). I don’t have an appointment to talk to Shady Grove yet but our appointment to speak with CNY is in November. November seems like a lifetime from now and I’m upset with myself that I didn’t request a consult earlier.

I put together a [comparison of success rates](https://imgur.com/a/eSvW5XD) from both the CDC and SART for MFI/ICSI. The rates at our current, expensive clinic (CCRM) are great, Shady Grove is almost as great, and CNY is not so great. I know that I shouldn’t directly be comparing them but I’m not sure how else to inform our decision.

Does anyone have any advice? Should we go to a less expensive but potentially less successful clinic? Should we go all in with CCRM and their high success rates? Has anyone had the same or similar diagnosis and deliberated over which clinic to begin with? Since this is our first IVF or infertility treatment of any kind, should we try with a less expensive clinic and ""upgrade"" if things don’t work out? From the hunger games IVF spreadsheet, it seems like our cost is 2-3x as much as most other IVF cycle costs so are we severely over-paying? Any advice would be incredibly appreciated.

From the hunger games IVF spreadsheet, it seems like our cost is 2-3x as much as most other IVF cycle costs so are we severely over-paying? Any advice would be incredibly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance,</p>

23 y/o Female, overweight (BMI of 49 currently), type 2 diabetic--

Husband and I got married a year ago (July 2019), and have been trying ever since (currently on cycle 12). We are young but stable and very ready. I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 15, just diagnosed with diabetes 6 months ago. I have had regular, 28 day cycles ever since I got my period for the first time. I have a history of cysts, but none currently.

I've been working with a dietitian and have lost nearly 40 pounds since January 2020, though she will not discuss trying to conceive at all because she thinks I should lose all the weight first, and that I am too young.

Alternatively, my OB/GYN and primary say it is fine to proceed since my A1C (blood sugar) is stable. Met with my OB/gyn last month, had an ultrasound which only showed a small fibroid and so she suggested 3 options we could use going forward:

1- Clomid (50mg, day 5-9) with progesterone testing on CD 21; or Femara.

2- HSG

3- Sperm Analysis

We decided to go forward with a round of Clomid, and on CD 21 my progesterone level was only 10. Not pregnant this month. Dr. recommended to move up to 100 mg this next round. I am pretty devastated because I let myself hope this month.

We currently have excellent health insurance that will cover all 3, but are considering an out of state move, which would leave us without infertility related coverage.

On to my questions:

1: Anyone have info on what an appropriate progesterone level on CD 21 would be? My DR is on vacation so I have no real info on that.

2: If you're overweight, how has that impacted your fertility journey/experience, and any advice?

3: Do you think we should push to have a HSG and sperm analysis done before we move since it would be covered? There's really no indication it would be either of those things causing issues but it might be nice to rule out before losing coverage.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result.

The results of the ultrasound showed far fewer follicles than the last round, and running the math is causing me to question whether I should continue with this cycle at all, or cut my losses and try again. I could use the advice from all of you wonderful, knowledgeable people who have experienced this too.

Some background:

First, on my medical situation- there are two important factors here- the cause of my infertility, and a genetic issue.

* Infertility: My infertility is due to missing tubes, which were removed along with a number of other bits and pieces to save my life when I was a small child. I had undiagnosed appendicitis as a toddler- it ruptured, and infection spread throughout my abdomen, and they had to remove it wherever it went. I am very fortunate and grateful that my ovaries and uterus are intact and healthy. My eggs have been assessed as being good quality, as has my uterus and lining. Again, very, very grateful for that.
* Sex-Linked Genetic Disorder: When we began IVF, we decided to do ALL the tests we could. My husband is a scientist, I work in systems and data, and we both prefer having as much information as possible. The genetic/compatibility test turned up something totally unexpected - I am a carrier of Hemophilia B, or Christmas disease. As we investigated this further, we found the specific variant I have is severe, and I myself am a symptomatic carrier. Many variants of hemophilia don't present at all in women, but the one I carry is severe enough that it basically shows up as ""hemophilia-light"" in the words of my hematologist. This explains a lot of things myself, my mother, and my maternal grandmother have experienced- the constant bruising, the life-long anemia, and the very protracted, heavy periods. Given the severity of the variant and the impact it could have on any children, we are moving forward with specific testing to determine carrier status in our embryos. It's a 50-50 chance of being a carrier, which means a 50% further cut to our viable embryos, most likely. A further complication here- both my husband and I are very nervous about male children as a result. The genetic test is 97% accurate, but that means 1 in 30 times, the test will provide a false negative. In a female child, that will be manageable. In a male child, it will be massively life-impacting or even deadly. We aren't sure we want to take that risk, though we're still discussing it.

One other key bit of background- my last cycle. Just before Covid set in and shut everything down for a bit, we did our first round of IVF in March. At the same point I am at now (Day 8 of the cycle) I had 21 follicles. Subsequently, they were able to retrieve 16 eggs, of which 12 were mature, 10 fertilized, leading to 5 total embryos, of which 3 where chomosomally normal. Of those three, we can assume 50% likely carry hemophilia, which takes us down to 1.5. If I compare that to the original 21 follicles on Day 8, that is a 7% success rate. Depending on how we decide to proceed or not with males, given the risk, that potentially gets cut down to 3.5%.

So, fast forward to today: In my Day 8 check this morning, there were 8 viable follicles. There is one additional one, but it's already ""ahead"" of the others, and the RE says it will not yield a viable egg as a result, and the focus is thus on the remaining ""cohort"" of 8. If I multiply that by my 7%/3.5% success rate, that's going to put me at .5/.25 viable embryos. Those numbers don't seem good, to me- it means 1 viable embryo at best, and possibly not even that. I'm wondering if it would be better to terminate this cycle and try again.

There have been some key differences this cycle- one, we started two days later against my menstrual cycle, due to a miscommunication on the part of the clinic coordinator (very frustrated about that, still). Additionally, my RE put me on a higher dose of Gonal this time around. Last time, she started me at 150 each day, which lead to steady growth, but a longer cycle in which she upped me to 200 for the last two days. This time she started directly at 200, and I'm wondering if that is the reason for the more uneven growth this time around.

So, if I could get the benefit of your experience and advice- am I just grasping at straws thinking another cycle will turn out better? Should I just proceed with the current one given the numbers? Am I being excessive or over-anxious here?

Getting out of the math and analysis for a moment- I also just feel extremely sad and disappointed and am questioning everything I've done since the cycle started. It's really gotten to me, badly, and I wonder if that's slanting my judgement.

I would appreciate any insight you can give!

CLARIFICATION UPDATES:

\- Baseline follicles counts from the last cycle to this one were closer, but the second cycle was lower - 23 and 20 respectively.

\- We have to do a specifically-designed test on the existing DNA samples to locate my specific variant of hemophilia (PGT-M). That test is still in design, and anticipated to be ready right around when any embryos from this new cycle would be ready for testing. The plan is to run the specific PGT-M test on both the previous 3 embryos and any new ones the same time that we do PGT-A for the new cycle.

\- We can possibly afford to do another cycle if we do it this year, but that's not a surety. We are very, fortunate that our insurance covers some of the IVF treatment, but only after we hit our out of pocket maximum, which is pretty steep. We did hit that with our first cycle, which means more of this is covered now. However, hitting it again if we head into a new year would be a stretch. Additionally, our clinic required a high up-front deposit for each cycle. Depending on what we can or can't salvage from the budget from this one, making the deposit again may be a stretch, given how long the return from the insurance company takes to process once things are billed back.

\- We would be grateful for 1 child, and don't have aspirations beyond that.

In a male child, it will be massively life-impacting or even deadly. We aren&#39;t sure we want to take that risk, though we&#39;re still discussing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>One other key bit of background- my last cycle. Just before Covid set in and shut everything down for a bit, we did our first round of IVF in March. At the same point I am at now (Day 8 of the cycle) I had 21 follicles. Subsequently, they were able to retrieve 16 eggs, of which 12 were mature, 10 fertilized, leading to 5 total embryos, of which 3 where chomosomally normal. Of those three, we can assume 50% likely carry hemophilia, which takes us down to 1.5. If I compare that to the original 21 follicles on Day 8, that is a 7% success rate. Depending on how we decide to proceed or not with males, given the risk, that potentially gets cut down to 3.5%.</p>

<p>So, fast forward to today: In my Day 8 check this morning, there were 8 viable follicles. There is one additional one, but it&#39;s already &quot;ahead&quot; of the others, and the RE says it will not yield a viable egg as a result, and the focus is thus on the remaining &quot;cohort&quot; of 8. If I multiply that by my 7%/3.5% success rate, that&#39;s going to put me at .5/.25 viable embryos. Those numbers don&#39;t seem good, to me- it means 1 viable embryo at best, and possibly not even that. I&#39;m wondering if it would be better to terminate this cycle and try again.</p>

<p>There have been some key differences this cycle- one, we started two days later against my menstrual cycle, due to a miscommunication on the part of the clinic coordinator (very frustrated about that, still). Additionally, my RE put me on a higher dose of Gonal this time around. Last time, she started me at 150 each day, which lead to steady growth, but a longer cycle in which she upped me to 200 for the last two days. This time she started directly at 200, and I&#39;m wondering if that is the reason for the more uneven growth this time around.</p>

<p>So, if I could get the benefit of your experience and advice- am I just grasping at straws thinking another cycle will turn out better? Should I just proceed with the current one given the numbers? Am I being excessive or over-anxious here?</p>

<p>Getting out of the math and analysis for a moment- I also just feel extremely sad and disappointed and am questioning everything I&#39;ve done since the cycle started. It&#39;s really gotten to me, badly, and I wonder if that&#39;s slanting my judgement.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any insight you can give!</p>

<p>CLARIFICATION UPDATES:</p>

<p>- Baseline follicles counts from the last cycle to this one were closer, but the second cycle was lower - 23 and 20 respectively.</p>

<p>- We have to do a specifically-designed test on the existing DNA samples to locate my specific variant of hemophilia (PGT-M). That test is still in design, and anticipated to be ready right around when any embryos from this new cycle would be ready for testing. The plan is to run the specific PGT-M test on both the previous 3 embryos and any new ones the same time that we do PGT-A for the new cycle.</p>

<p>- We can possibly afford to do another cycle if we do it this year, but that&#39;s not a surety. We are very, fortunate that our insurance covers some of the IVF treatment, but only after we hit our out of pocket maximum, which is pretty steep. We did hit that with our first cycle, which means more of this is covered now. However, hitting it again if we head into a new year would be a stretch. Additionally, our clinic required a high up-front deposit for each cycle. Depending on what we can or can&#39;t salvage from the budget from this one, making the deposit again may be a stretch, given how long the return from the insurance company takes to process once things are billed back.</p>

<p>- We would be grateful for 1 child, and don&#39;t have aspirations beyond that.</p>

These things can only be seen with more invasive imaging or advanced imaging, as for example through an HSG. \n\nAn hsg can show you if you have a heart shaped uterus, a septum, a septate uterus, polyps, fibroids, other growths, etc. All these things will cause you to miscarry and a lot of them.can be fixed! \nIf you've ever had a late term miscarriage, still birth or early labor, placenta issues such as placenta abbrevia etc, I would HIGHLY recommend for you to get an HSG done. Heart shaped uteri especially can stretch out during pregnancy so on the ultrasound they may look normal, but they're not, and they're causing circulatory problems for the baby as it grows. \nKnowing this before you get pregnant can help to prevent some of these nightmares because it will put you into the high risk pregnancy category and you'll get monitored like crazy to make sure they can get your baby out in the third trimester before anything happens to it, I.e growth issues, still birth, and late term miscarriage.\n\nTHIS was totally worth it for me to get an hsg done and sure enough, I have a heart shaped uterus.\nThank God I know this now because none of my REs or OBs ultrasounds has ever picked this up before.\n\nEDIT: your doctor should give you prophylactic antibiotics for at least five days, to be started one day before your procedure.

Lol.</p>\n\n<p>Well it turns out that the ultrasound you get at your ob or REs office cannot see everything in your uterus that might be helpful. These things can only be seen with more invasive imaging or advanced imaging, as for example through an HSG. </p>\n\n<p>An hsg can show you if you have a heart shaped uterus, a septum, a septate uterus, polyps, fibroids, other growths, etc. All these things will cause you to miscarry and a lot of them.can be fixed! \nIf you&#39;ve ever had a late term miscarriage, still birth or early labor, placenta issues such as placenta abbrevia etc, I would HIGHLY recommend for you to get an HSG done. Heart shaped uteri especially can stretch out during pregnancy so on the ultrasound they may look normal, but they&#39;re not, and they&#39;re causing circulatory problems for the baby as it grows. \nKnowing this before you get pregnant can help to prevent some of these nightmares because it will put you into the high risk pregnancy category and you&#39;ll get monitored like crazy to make sure they can get your baby out in the third trimester before anything happens to it, I.e growth issues, still birth, and late term miscarriage.</p>\n\n<p>THIS was totally worth it for me to get an hsg done and sure enough, I have a heart shaped uterus.\nThank God I know this now because none of my REs or OBs ultrasounds has ever picked this up before.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: your doctor should give you prophylactic antibiotics for at least five days, to be started one day before your procedure. That is the proper care and if you don&#39;t get it, DEMAND IT. \nAlso demand anxiety and pain meds. YOU are the patient and why suffer through something unnecessarily??? Just take the gosh darn Tylenol 3 with codeine, take that Ativan, or Xanax. Trust me, you&#39;ll be happier, less stressed, it&#39;s worth it, and if it&#39;s not offered to you, DEMAND IT from your prescribing doctor. \nWomen&#39;s pain gets brushed off way too often and we cannot let that happen. </p>\n\n<p>Where to go in the Los Angeles area:\nDr Chin at San Fernando valley interventional radiology in Encino, California, is THE BEST DOCTOR OF ALL TIMES when it comes to hsg.\nI FELT NOTHING. absolutely nothing. I still can&#39;t believe it. I&#39;m sitting here in disbelief writing this. \nI thank him so much for putting me at ease and being so damn good at his job. \nHell, my regular ultrasound at my REs office is worse than this. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I hope this helps anyone dealing with recurrent loss or similar, reach out if you like, community support and sharing knowledge and experiences is so important. </p>\n\n<p>XOXO!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_3hbq0', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'ht3q9e', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': '88Black_Mamba88', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 6, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/ht3q9e/why_you_should_get_an_hsg_and_where_to_go_for_it/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/ht3q9e/why_you_should_get_an_hsg_and_where_to_go_for_it/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1232, 'created_utc': 1595019351.0, 'num_crossposts': 2, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/ht3q9e/why_you_should_get_an_hsg_and_where_to_go_for_it/,t3_ht3q9e,,,

Again not sure why they made me wait) I was given my first round of MTX in the cancer ward of a hospital, at an hcg of over 10,0000 (!!!! Again. Just completely shitty care. None of this should have ever happened.)\nNaturally at this high of an hcg I needed a second round of MTX.\nWhat nobody told me (again, not shocking considering the quality of my care after the fact) was that MTX kills your ovarian reserve. I had blood panels done a month before this ectopic and it was all normal, so I have a good reference point. My AMH was 2.6 and FSH was 5. Perfect!\n\nIt took almost four months for my hcg to hit 0 and I decided to stop listening to the shitty advice of my shitty doctor. I moved across the country and started supplements (yes, even folate, because, f* em, mtx is only active in your body for 7 days, thereafter you can drink booze and eat normally again and after about 30 days you can start taking folate to try to heal your body asap, it will NOT slow down your hcg breakdown, that is a complete myth after 30 days, there is zero evidence to that), working out, etc. \nWhat you can do to increase the hcg breakdown is to increase your liver function and cell turnover, by exercising and eating clean and feeding your damaged cells all the good nutrients they need.\nAlso, please go to therapy: I got post partum depression after my last MTX shot and it\'s extremely terrible. Yes you can get this even if you didn\'t actually give birth. It is causes by a sudden dramatic shift in hormones. You don\'t have to go through this alone. \n\nI changed doctors and sought out a highly regarded fertility clinic here in California to try to figure out what the hell happened and why. Both my husband and I got tested again and well wouldn\'t you know! \n\nFirst, my AMH was essentially killed at 0.8 now along with my AFC at a mere 4 total, and FSH at a 9 and the rest of my hormones were complete shit. I\'m like a couple of months away from being premenopausal. While mtx is only active in your body for 7 days, it damages the environment for proper egg growth for at least 180 days (Stanford study) and your egg reserve and quality will be shit until after that time is over. So I got a little bit of hope here at least.\n\nSecond, my hsg came back clear. Of course. Some of the studies I waltzed through show that up to 97.5% of women with ectopics actually have clear tubes when tested after the ectopic (note, HSGs can only test for structural issues, not functional ones like issues with ciliae, that you can only assess during a lap surgery. You\'re not likely to have functional issues unless you also have Endo or PCOS or other medical conditions). So I started to become suspicious of why that happened to me in the first place, since I have no other medical conditions. \nAll the doctors so far I had talked to said that ectopics are either just random or due to blocked tubes but that is actually only the minority of cases! The most likely and highly preventable cause is here: \n\nmy husband got another SA but this time, an ""advanced semen analysis report"" that also looks for DNA fragmentation. This does not get picked up by a regular SA. \nAnd what would you know.... Turns out he has pyospermia (white blood cells in his semen) that are the cause of his high DNA fragmentation (it should be ideally less than 8%, he is at 26%. You\'re considered infertile at 30%). Dna fragmentation doesn\'t stop you from conceiving, but it does cause ectopics and miscarriages, especially missed miscarriages. \nEven when doing IVF, because unless you ask for a DNA fragmentation test, they will commonly just do a regular semen analysis where this issue won\'t show, and you will likely make ""normal"" embryos, because even PGS testing doesn\'t pick up dna fragmentation, and you will keep getting ectopics and miscarriages, wondering what the f*.\nOnce you know your partner has DNA fragmentation, your IVF lab can use a special procedure during ivf to sort these broken guys out, lowering your risk of ectopics/miscarriages, called PICSI/zymot or just do TESE. \nWe decided on the ivf route because of our currently extremely high chance of miscarriage and ectopic and I cannot physically do another treatment for an ectopic and ruin the few eggs I have left. \nWhether or not you do IVF (because hello, cost), definitely also send your partner to a reproductive urologist to get a culture taken to cure whatever underlying inflammation there may be and check for varicoles. All this can cause DNA fragmentation, and it can be improved!\n\nWell now you know. \nGET YOUR MALE PARTNER\'S SPERM TESTED FOR DNA FRAGMENTATION!\n\nIt aggravates me to no end that fertility issues/investigations always seem to be focusing the women, as if nothing could ever be wrong with the dudes. \n\nAnyway, hope my experience can help someone out there, good luck and keep pushing!

1. Has anyone with unexplained infertility gone into IVF and had the process uncover a problem that wasn’t found through previous testing or treatments? For background, we’ve done HSG tests, Semen analysis tests, etc. I have above average number of eggs on both sides and with trigger shots, we know I’m ovulating. Everything on both sides looks good but it’s been over a year and no positives. I’m wondering if that means that we have a problem that is yet undiscovered. 

2. I’ve read/been advised that doing more IUI’s past 3 or 4 have plateauing or declining rates of success- if it was going to work, it would have already.  Has anyone here experienced anything to contradict or support this? I’ve read occasionally that people often wish they’d moved to IVF sooner than they did and consider many IUIs to be a waste of time. 

3. IVF cost is so high and for me and my husband, we’ll be paying out of pocket as insurance won’t cover it. Because of this we can’t go into the treatment assuming that we can do it for many cycles in a row.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation? For those who have IVF experience (positive or negative) how many cycles would you consider worth it to do? I’ve tried to find studies on success rates and have difficulty finding ones that fit my situation.

1. I do have lots of other little follicles, they only measure the larger ones
2. I think the goal of trigger is a follicle at 12 mm, I don’t think they’re looking for specific lab levels. To my understanding that’s different that traditional IVF a bit but I may be wrong. 
3. In the past I never had labs/US after trigger, so I wouldn’t know how to compare them anyway.
4. I definitely think it took 3 cycles to get the right med doses, the first cycle stimmed for too long, and the second was too short. 

Comparing 3 Cycles: 

Cycle 1: 32 retrieved, 10 fertilized, 10 day 3, 7 viable at day 5 (2 biopsied, 5 appropriate but needed more time, 2 were slow), 3 embryos sent for PGS (2 day 5, 1 day 7), two PGS normal embryos

Cycle 2: 31 eggs retrieved, 14 fertilized, 14 day 3 (one slow), 1 day 5, 1 day 6, one inconclusive embryo resulted (rested normal)

I didn’t get my period by the age of 16 and was diagnosed with primary amenorrhea. As a result I was required to get a full fertility work up which included blood tests, genetic tests, a progesterone challenge, an mri, and a bone density scan. After all of my testing the doctor said she couldn’t find anything wrong and that I probably just worked out to much so my official diagnosis was hypothalamic amenorrhea. My bones were underdeveloped, my uterus was small, and I didn’t bleed on progesterone but other than that nothing else was wrong so I was promptly placed on birth control and got my period.

Fast forward to when I turned 23 and I revisited the gyno who told me something was wrong because I’ve gained enough weight to have my period, she then referred me to an endocrinologist where I was subjected to another round of testing all to be told again that they couldn’t find anything wrong.

I just continued my birth control. About 2 years ago I started having a constant pain in my left abdomen so I went to the gyno and they performed an ultrasound and found blood on my uterus. Gyno said he normally sees this is menopausal women but I’m not in menopause so as long as I’m not in pain he doesn’t see an issue.

Now I’m ready to have children but I’m very afraid that I just won’t be able to. I’ve reduced that I have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism so I’m afraid of not responding to any medication. I’m also afraid that frequent bv infections and yeast infections due to my fluctuating hormones have scared me and I’m afraid that the blood on my uterus has caused adhesions that will lead to an embryo not being able to implant.

295,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello there. I will appreciate your input/advice or if you can share a similar experience. 

This is my 3rd IUI.

My cycle started 24 days ago. I was on clomid for 10 days total and then gonal-f for 8 days total. 

On wednesday I saw the RE(not my regular one since he is traveling). Follicles were there, and nothing was out of ordinary. She scheduled our insemination for Friday. And instructed to inject the trigger shot that night.

Same day(wednesday) few hours after the visit and BEFORE the teigger shot I started having uterine cramps, ovarian pain and back pain. I did an ovulation test and it was very positive. Later we injected the trigger shot on time. My pain lasted for 7-8 hours until I took a tylonol. 

I was worried that my ovulation might have started sooner than planned and thought maybe we need to do the insemination one day early to not miss the window.

I called this morning and we went in for an ultrasound. There were follicles still(not sure if the same number as before) but also the RE saw a couple of liquid things(?) in my uterus. She hadn't noticed such a thing the day before. 

She doesnt know what it is. It can be blood(menstruation starting- but Im not spotting) or embryo sack(if SOMEHOW we got pregnant or something else. 

There is no reliable way to know if Im pregnant because the trigger shot can give us a false positive. The RE wanted to drain the liquid but since there is a possibility of it being an embryo she didnt proceed. They drew blood to test my estrogen and progesterone. 

We are going back in tomorrow.
I dont know what we should do. Should we forgo the insemination and try naturally instead and possibly lose this cycle? Or should we do the insemination although it will destroy the embryo if there is one?

I dont think the doctor will have a clear diagnosis until tomorrow. 

Has anyone else experienced mysterious liquid in their uterus? Any advice?

Info: I had stage 4 endometriosis(excised). I have an autoimmune disease. 

Thank you

Edit: the lab somehow was able to run beta on my blood sample from 5 days before(somehow they still had it?) and it was negative so we are going ahead with the insemination. Wish us luck!
