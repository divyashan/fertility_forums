DH and I are 34, have been TTC for 18 months (6 months NTNP, and about 3-4 months the timing wasn't 100% due to travel). Both healthy weight. Have had bloods done, and mine came back normal but my doc told me I have a retroverted uterus. I also had appendicitis recently and I've heard that can cause infertility. DH had a SA done and everything was fine except for concentration which was 12mil/ml, but total count was 84mil (60% morph). We saw an OBGYN back in December and he said to just keep trying, but still no BFP, not even a hint of one. 

We want 3 kids, but seems like even making 1 is hard enough, and I'm concerned that if we eventually get that elusive BFP, then I may have a MC and have to start this whole process again, and if we do have a healthy birth, then by the time my periods return and we can try again, then time will be running out. I'm extra concerned since finding out that it took 2 years for my friend's period to return (although I know everyone is different etc).

I have an appointment with another doc on July 16th, and I was wondering if I should ask about having IVF with the intention to freeze all to preserve embryos for later on when we are trying for number 2 or 3. I'm concerned that when that time comes, I'll be getting close to 40 and may have to use donor eggs if I don't try to preserve embryos now.

What would you do if you were me? Thanks in advance for the advice!

https://ud.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3c5p9s/my_er_today/

Essentially both IVF attempts have resulted with very few of the embryos lasting past a day. We have no diagnosis and I am 28. I am feeling very disheartened by it.  I have 3 embryos developing currently.
 I'm debating asking the nurse who calls tomorrow with an update to discuss with the dr. I want to know if I should move ahead with a transfer, assuming theres anything to transfer on day 5. Or, should we freeze and do some more testing to see why this has happened twice now. Is it worth using a transfer (covered by insurance) when maybe we need to do PGS or karotyping or any other test to see if theres a sperm or egg issue? 

For #1 out of 6 eggs, 2 fertlized and 1 made it to day 5.
For #2 out of 11 eggs, 3 have made it to day 2 so far.

I have tried several things to try and get pregnant over the last 3 years and nothing has worked. I am seeing a fertility specialist who also specializes in endo. I guess he wrote the book on endo and infertility. He was confident that ivf was going to be how I would get pregnant. So I started my first round for ivf about two weeks ago. They put me on Menopur and Gonal-f once a day then cetrotide in the morning. All went well. I gave my trigger shots, hCG and another drug that I can't the name. The hCG intramuscular shot was awful! It didn't hurt going in, but the medication STUNG! 

Yesterday I had my retrieval. I was put under because I didn't want to feel anything. When I woke up, they said everything went well and I would feel bruised for a bit, which was just like cramping. Not too crazy. I got a call today with some results. She said 4 were immature, 3 degenerated, and they were able to use 7. Of those 7, 5 fertilized and they would know more tomorrow about how well each grew. We opted to do time lapse photography where they take a picture every 8 minutes to see which one is the best. I'm scheduled tomorrow for the transfer.

Here are my concerns. I'm worried that the five embryos won't make it or won't be good enough to use. I'm worried that if they do make it that they won't implant and when we unthaw the rest that none of them will make it. I'm not sure if we'll go through another ivf cycle since it's so expensive. I may have to make a life changing decision. My doctor wants me to be able to get pregnant within the next 6 months because I keep growing endometrium cysts. He seems to think getting pregnant will help my disease. 

I hate every bit of this. I want a child so badly and nothing has been easy or gone smoothly with much during this whole process. What is everyone's experience with having a few eggs make it this far in the process? Does anyone have success statistics anywhere? Any information or stories would be nice.

My husband has Cystic Fibrosis and we know he is infertile due to having no vas deferens. About 2 months ago he underwent a double lung transplant and so far he is going wonderfully. Life is so much better for us now and we finally feel as though we can think about children. Honestly, I want it more than anything. I've wanted to be a mum since I was a little girl. So the idea of not at least trying to get pregnant is almost unthinkable. Luckily, my husband is on the same page and wants to move forward with ICSI and we have an appointment with an IVF Clinic next week.

Secretly though, I am carrying a lot of fear and guilt. I am not a CF carrier (already been tested) so I know no child we have will have CF. They will be a carrier though, and I hate the idea that they will have to go through tests and maybe IVF to make sure they don't have children with CF. My husband feels like I am overthinking things and I shouldn't assume that medical science won't have advanced by the time any of our children are ready for children. Still, I can't help but feel selfish for the shitty gene they will be stuck with through no fault of their own. 

The other thing is no one knows how long my husband will actually survive with new lungs. Some people live less than a year, others live 20+ years and there is no way of predicting it. I like to imagine that we will have a lot of time together, but realistically I just don't know. I am scared we will have a baby and they won't get enough time with their dad. 

Adoption is not an option for us because Cystic Fibrosis is considered a terminal illness in our country (in regards to adoption at least). Fostering may be something we consider, and my husband actually really likes the idea of it. I am not sure if the same rules apply for fostering as for adoption, but it may be an avenue we explore later. I am open to using a sperm donor, but my husband refuses to consider it.

I am back, and I have a question!

General background: 31 female, no MFI, unexplained but recently diagnosed with PCOS. I have shitty ovulation and elevated levels of DHEA sulfate, all other hormones are normal and I don't have cysts, but my RE feels I fall on the PCOS ""spectrum."" Timeline: 5 failed IUIs, had a large fibroid removed, now on my second IUI post-surgery and with a new and better clinic. 

Current status and question: Of my first group of IUIs, none of them were monitored. My current RE is thankfully monitoring. My first cycle, on CD 12 I had 2 dominant follicles at 18 and 16mm, lining was 7.6. I triggered with ovidrel the evening of CD14, and the IUI was 36 hours after the trigger. I got my period after a 12 day luteal phase. 

I just had my CD 12 ultrasound for this month. Well, it's not looking as good. Between my ovaries I have 30 useless follicles that started to develop, and after a bit of searching she found one dominant follicle that is only 14x15 mm. She wants it to mature 3 more days before triggering. Problem is, I can and do ovulate on my own, and my LH OPK test strips are getting dark so there is worry I may release an immature egg before those three days go by. I guess only time will tell. At the very least this time the lining was better at 9.3 and with that triple pattern they look for.

I am on 5mg of femara taken CD 3-7. I was shocked, and the doctor seemed surprised as well, about the 30 follicles that started to develop. Has anyone else had this happen while on femara or clomid? I know my response was not like this during the first cycle. I am worried that if we do this protocol for a third month that none of them will be dominant and I will just have tons of useless ones. After having such lovely follicles during the first cycle, I was surprised to only have one this time, and it seems to not be growing as well on top of that. I already feel like I am out this cycle. Any advice? I will talk to my doctor's nurse in the next few days, and I was wondering if going to 7.5mg of femara might be beneficial for me, or would that just make me create even more little follicles?

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi friends,

I’m looking for advice and thoughts on what our next step should be with regards to treatment. Here’s the short version of our story so far…

Me: low AMH, probable blocked tubes 

Mr Miranda: SA results at the low end of the average range.

IVF with ICSI was our best choice. We got 6 5-day embryos (from 7 eggs retrieved) from the cycle in Nov/Dec 2014. 1 fresh transfer & 2 FETs later, no result. According to my RE the fresh cycle and the first FET cycle were textbook in terms of timing, response, everything. They just didn’t work. The second FET cycle was all over the place (early CD1, I didn’t have the LH spike until CD24 and that only came after a week of FSH ‘booster’ injections) and didn’t work either. In terms of progesterone support, I have had crinone twice and pregnyl shots once (in that order).

After our third failed transfer our RE sent me for all the tests. Karyotyping, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus, MTHFR, all the autoimmune things. Everything came back as clear. Her suggested plan is continue FET cycles with FSH support starting earlier in the cycle until we have no more embryos and then review. Her view is that we have just had bad luck up until now. She is happy for us to begin our next FET cycle whenever we are ready, but she is on leave for the next month so I wouldn’t want to start until she returns anyway. I have an appointment with her for the end of July. I’ve already decided I’m going to ask why she doesn’t recommend a fresh retrieval cycle with PGS/PGD and why she doesn’t want to do an endometrial biopsy.

My possible actions are:

* Get a second opinion from an RE at a different clinic

<p>I’m looking for advice and thoughts on what our next step should be with regards to treatment. Here’s the short version of our story so far…</p>

<p>Me: low AMH, probable blocked tubes </p>

<p>Mr Miranda: SA results at the low end of the average range.</p>

<p>IVF with ICSI was our best choice. We got 6 5-day embryos (from 7 eggs retrieved) from the cycle in Nov/Dec 2014. 1 fresh transfer &amp; 2 FETs later, no result. According to my RE the fresh cycle and the first FET cycle were textbook in terms of timing, response, everything. They just didn’t work. The second FET cycle was all over the place (early CD1, I didn’t have the LH spike until CD24 and that only came after a week of FSH ‘booster’ injections) and didn’t work either. In terms of progesterone support, I have had crinone twice and pregnyl shots once (in that order).</p>

<p>After our third failed transfer our RE sent me for all the tests. Karyotyping, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus, MTHFR, all the autoimmune things. Everything came back as clear. Her suggested plan is continue FET cycles with FSH support starting earlier in the cycle until we have no more embryos and then review. Her view is that we have just had bad luck up until now. She is happy for us to begin our next FET cycle whenever we are ready, but she is on leave for the next month so I wouldn’t want to start until she returns anyway. I have an appointment with her for the end of July. I’ve already decided I’m going to ask why she doesn’t recommend a fresh retrieval cycle with PGS/PGD and why she doesn’t want to do an endometrial biopsy.</p>

<p>My possible actions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Get a second opinion from an RE at a different clinic</p></li>
<li><p>Continue with FET cycles as the RE recommends</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on what she says at our appt, move to a fresh cycle with PGS (either with her or a new clinic, if I find another one I like)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Can I have your thoughts/ideas/suggestions/advice please? Thank you all x</p>

 My partner and I have been trying to conceive for about 9 months. As she's 35, we decided to start on some initial fertility testing. Her results were mostly normal (progesterone was slightly on the low side of average), but my sperm analysis came back much worse.

 The majority of my results were normal (volume, number, and even motility), except for my sperm morphology. Using strict criteria, only 2% were considered normal. 83% were amorphously abnormal (I believe this constitutes multiple or gross morphological issues). As such, the lab classified my sperm analysis as indicating teratozoospermia.

 We'll be meeting with our physicians next week. I'm going to start by improving lifestyle choices (limited caffeine, no alcohol, vitamin supplementation, etc...), as I assume we'll want to retest in 3 months. In your experience, though, should we start pushing for reproductive assitance right away? Is it better to jump right into IVF-ICSI? Freezing is not legal in our country, so we can only do a 1-3 embryo transfer at a time. Would washing / IUI be worthwhile in this type of situation? I'm trying to review the literature (I'm a science type), but it's difficult to tell what the next best step is. Thankfully, the financial concerns aren't a problem, but the discomfort might be an issue for my partner (personally, I'm willing to suffer whatever discomfort is needed).

 Sorry if this is a bit ramble-y. I am really not the type of person to seek comfort from others; I've always been the strong, silent type. I don't deal well with discussing this type of thing, either. So this is difficult for me to come to terms with. I've spent all day reading /r/infertility (and going through every related historical post), but anything else you can share will be helpful.

I'm 26, my husband is 29, and we've been married for two years...no children. I found out that I had a blighted ovum at 6 weeks after spotting for a day back in March this year. I miscarried naturally, had one cycle, then got pregnant again at the end of April. After much more significant symptoms, I was encouraged and hopeful that the first was just a fluke. Unfortunately it wasn't...I went in for my first ultrasound at 7 weeks at the end of May and saw another empty sac, blighted ovum AGAIN. After confirming sluggish HCG levels, I had a D&C a week later.

After my second miscarriage, my doctor sent me to have a maternal karyotype done along with lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid antibodies, and cardiolipin antibodies testing almost two weeks ago (after confirming with my insurance company that they would cover it, since I have ""only"" had two miscarriages as opposed to the typically required three). I also had the products of conception sent for chromosomal testing after my D&C. I should get the clotting/auto immune results this week.

We have decided to wait until the results of the various test come back before heading to a specialist. My OB thinks I should go see a perinatologist as opposed to an RE, since I ""don't have any trouble getting pregnant."" I'm not so sure. I am anxious to see what the tests say...it's been difficult living in limbo, information comforts me. If there is something wrong with my blood, there are things to fix that. I guess the ""worst"" case scenario would be genetic issues, since IVF w/ PGD seems to be the only ""fix for that...other than being brave and continuing until the right sperm/egg combo happens. Thankfully my insurance covers up to $100k for IVF. My husband and I have also discussed having him go see a urologist for an SA and paternal karyotype.

Emotionally, I am doing okay. In the absence of any significant medical issues, it has been hard to cope with the fact that something is wrong...I feel like my body is betraying me. I have started acupuncture twice a week, which does seem to be helping stress/anxiety-wise. My husband has been absolutely wonderful, for which I am really grateful for. 

Thanks so much for listening. Suggestions for any other avenues I should be exploring are beyond welcome!

UPDATE: My results were posted on the LabCorp portal today, but no call back from doctor to review them for me :(
Looks like my karyotype was normal. Seems like (from my interpretation) that I was negative for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin Ab, IgG/M, and beta-2 glycoprotein I Ab, IgG & IgM.

Emotionally tough, yes, but I'm keen to try again (as is my husband).  

Our specialist doesn't want to do a monitored clomid cycle until the second period post miscarriage. I was keen to start first period post miscarriage, I thought that was 'normal' as far as waiting to TTC goes.   

I have a box of clomid left over from a previous cycle, still in date. I'm in two minds about doing an unmonitored cycle (without telling the doctor). I'm obviously keen to try again, but:  
- if it's successful, I suspect I'm unlikely to be proscribed clomid again (and I'm not keen on deceiving my doctor)  
- if it's not successful, that could be because my uterus isn't 'ready', and I'm wasting one of my four remaining clomid cycles before I hit the magic-cancer-risk-six.   

I'm also crushed because a friend is pregnant, and another had her first miscarriage right when I had my second. I'd always thought I'd be the first to have kids in our group. It just feels like another thing I don't get to have. Pros are hand-me-downs, and the fact that clomid has worked for us both times in the past.   

What would you do? What did you do? I'd love any advice. I'm in Australia, so medical bills are less of an issue for us.

I was advised be our RE to go off birth control back in March since I have been on it for so many years and we are facing IVF to have a baby in the next year or so (we originally planned on the fall, but that isn't happening anymore...). 41 days after stopping BC I had my first natural period and 66 days later I had my second one. Everyone told me not to worry and that your body can just take time to adjust after BC- except my RE, who was a bit concerned. We decided to move forward with D3 testing despite not being ready to start IVF yet (my husband has a big CT scan in September, we need the results of that first). I had my ultrasound and d3 blood work yesterday morning and during the ultrasound everyone kept joking that I have very active ovaries. OK, I thought, thats good, right? Apparently not. I got a call that I had 20+ follicles in each of my ovaries and, as my nurse put it, ""it's a good thing we did the PCOS panel."" What!? This isn't supposed to happen... we have already dealt with testicular cancer. Isn't that enough? I know that isn't how life works and I feel bad even saying it realizing that many of you have been through just as much or more than us, but I can't help feel bad for us today. I can't help but hate my body today. By the way, my day 3 results looked like this, which she said were normal but after some research I'm wondering if my FSH is a little low:

FSH- 4.3
E2- 3.4
LH- 8.55
Prol- 8.04
TSH- 1.93

I have been saying for years that I thought something was wrong. Last year I tried to get my gyno to do testing when I developed horrible acne all of the sudden and she wouldn't. I'm just sad and frustrated and scared. We already have to deal with MFI due to the stupid cancer, and now it looks like something is probably wrong with me. 

Thanks for listening... I just needed to get it out. If anyone has information or advise, please feel free to let me know. I have been trying to do a lot of research regarding PCOS but I still have unanswered questions. Like, is it possible to have ovaries like mine and not have all of the hormonal issues? I am still waiting for those results (I did a big panel of tests earlier in the week)... I know it is unlikely that they will be normal considering my acne, but a girl can hope, right?

My husband and I have been through so much... and now I think another big blow is coming. </p>

<p>I was advised be our RE to go off birth control back in March since I have been on it for so many years and we are facing IVF to have a baby in the next year or so (we originally planned on the fall, but that isn&#39;t happening anymore...). 41 days after stopping BC I had my first natural period and 66 days later I had my second one. Everyone told me not to worry and that your body can just take time to adjust after BC- except my RE, who was a bit concerned. We decided to move forward with D3 testing despite not being ready to start IVF yet (my husband has a big CT scan in September, we need the results of that first). I had my ultrasound and d3 blood work yesterday morning and during the ultrasound everyone kept joking that I have very active ovaries. OK, I thought, thats good, right? Apparently not. I got a call that I had 20+ follicles in each of my ovaries and, as my nurse put it, &quot;it&#39;s a good thing we did the PCOS panel.&quot; What!? This isn&#39;t supposed to happen... we have already dealt with testicular cancer. Isn&#39;t that enough? I know that isn&#39;t how life works and I feel bad even saying it realizing that many of you have been through just as much or more than us, but I can&#39;t help feel bad for us today. I can&#39;t help but hate my body today. By the way, my day 3 results looked like this, which she said were normal but after some research I&#39;m wondering if my FSH is a little low:</p>

<p>FSH- 4.3
E2- 3.4
LH- 8.55
Prol- 8.04
TSH- 1.93</p>

<p>I have been saying for years that I thought something was wrong. Last year I tried to get my gyno to do testing when I developed horrible acne all of the sudden and she wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m just sad and frustrated and scared. We already have to deal with MFI due to the stupid cancer, and now it looks like something is probably wrong with me. </p>

<p>Thanks for listening... I just needed to get it out. If anyone has information or advise, please feel free to let me know. I have been trying to do a lot of research regarding PCOS but I still have unanswered questions. Like, is it possible to have ovaries like mine and not have all of the hormonal issues? I am still waiting for those results (I did a big panel of tests earlier in the week)... I know it is unlikely that they will be normal considering my acne, but a girl can hope, right? </p>

<p>Hope you all have a good weekend &lt;3</p>

Believe me, I have had my share of bad times, but for now, today, I feel grateful and I wanted to share. I understand that there are times when the last thing you want to read is a positive post, so if that's the place you're in now, I don't blame you if you don't want to read this. I've been there, so I want to warn you that this post is dripping with positive thoughts. :) Do with that what you will.

Our week, this week, started with a fun-filled, 3-day visit from our nephew and nieces (ages 9, 7 and 4). Sadly, the same week ended with us traveling out of state to be with a friend whose brother passed away and needed us to care for her two daughters (ages 3 and 1) while funeral arrangements were made.  For those of you keeping count, that’s 5 kids in 6 days for us, a couple who currently has no children! Talk about a crash course in childcare!

We started the week having fun with family, and ended the week mourning the loss of a friend. Those two bookends can either make you crazy or help you to give thanks for all that you have.

Today, I am giving thanks. 

I’m thankful for my husband and for the opportunities I had this week to watch him nurture and play with not one, but FIVE different children. He and I managed to establish childcare routines and practice being parents in both the best of conditions, and one of the worst situations. We practiced relying on each other, interpreting toddler cues, and giving each other quiet time for cleaning or a needed break. 

This week, for the first time, I am actually thankful for the time he and I have had the last 4 years struggling with infertility. I KNOW it sounds crazy…but for now, it’s true. 

I’m grateful because during this time without children we find ourselves constantly assessing the successes and challenges experienced by other parents, and by watching them, we are becoming better prepared for our own parenting journey... more confident. We continually find ourselves having conversations about the relationship dynamics of our mommy/daddy friends, and how they support (or fail to support) one another while raising their children. We wonder out loud how we will be in similar situations and discuss things we might do the same or differently in their shoes.

If we were not actively trying to become parents these last few years, we almost certainly would not be taking the same detailed mental notes on what works and what doesn’t. We wouldn’t be making the same observations, at least not from the same “planning” perspective. 

We also would not have the luxury of learning (in small doses) how we work as a parenting team, followed by the luxury of post-childcare pow-wows in which we itemize our successes and opportunities for improvement. We have the time to share with each other how proud we are to have each other as supportive partners (over some quiet time and a beer). These are things as new parents, we may not have the opportunity to share or evaluate together. We are grateful to have the opportunity now.

If we had been blessed with a child nearly 4 years ago when we started this journey,  the opportunities we’ve had to take notes and learn from each other and from our friend/parents might have been stifled by a crying baby, or post-partum depression, or just the chaos daily life.

This time we have, waiting for our family to grow, we’re making the most of it. And our future family will be all the better for it.

I'm currently on estrace to try and suppress cysts/super-early follicle development. We did confirm that I ovulated sometime before last Wednesday although exactly when is hard to say. If nothing is weird, I should start CD1 late this week, although it could be as late as sometime next week. (Unless something is weird, which happens.)

I'm not sure what we will be using to stim, although my impression is that new doc will carry on with old doc's plan to see what happens, which would be Clomid + Menopur and then later Ganirelix since I tend to ovulate early. (I have crappy response, and both docs thought that a high amount of stim isn't likely to work better than a low amount.) 

If CD1 is this week, that gives me a clear 3 weeks before I leave. Is that enough time to do a fresh cycle? Or enough time to at least get to egg retrieval? (If we have to freeze to make timing work, we can do that.)

I can, technically, drive back home to go to my clinic for a day--it's about 8 hours away, and my husband can drive while I doze off in the back of the car. However, this trip is about half-vacation/half-writing workshop and while the workshop leader is my wonderfully sympathetic and understanding mentor who knows about all my IF stuff, I kind of screw things up for everybody else if I'm gone a day. I'm willing to do that if I have to, but....

<p>I start BC on the upcoming CD1 which somehow feels like defeat and waving the white flag. We&#39;ve moved on from natural courses of reproduction after 39 cycles and we are diving into the IVF world. It&#39;s a great feeling, and a scary one.</p>

I went to a fertility doctor yesterday because my OB/Gyn had expressed that I should get pregnant ""ASAP"" because of my endometriosis. My endo is under control since 2010 and I have no daily pain or symptoms - I've had symptoms since age 11 so this lack of pain is huge for me and I was skeptical about pregnancy being necessary right now.

The fertility doc was initially very dismissive - ""You're 25! You're healthy! You'll be fertile!"" but then went totally silent when he did the ultrasound. He counted 3 follicles on one side and 4 on the other.  We're waiting now for my AMH results, which he says will take a week. He also thinks taking me off my continuous BC may help.

I'm handling this as calmly as I can, but I'm in medical school and the only thing keeping my terrible endo symptoms under control is the continuous birth control. Thankfully my boyfriend is INCREDIBLE and has told me unequivocally that he will stay regardless of the outcome.

I'm really on the edge of being too old for any of this, but want to try again, as the last time we checked, all my numbers were good for my age, and my cycle is still really regular.

My first IVF was:  8 mature eggs, 5 fertilized, 1 made it to day 5 for biopsy and freezing.  Second was:  8 mature eggs, 6 fertilized, 3 made it to day 5 for biopsy and freezing.  PGS testing gave us one normal embryo, which was the one we transferred at the beginning of the month.

My tentative plan (I haven't talked to my doctor yet) is to do 3 IVF cycles, then batch everything for testing at the end of that, and then go from there.

Here are some things I'm considering in order to make this as successful as possible:
* lose some weight (the last almost two years of trying to get pregnant have not been positive in this area) -- probably by trying to keep carbs on the lower (but not crazy low) side and aim for lots of protein.
* try to convince my doctor to not put me on birth control for suppression before starting stims -- I felt like I was over-suppressed last time.
* retest all my day 3 numbers just to make sure nothing's changed too much
* anything that might help egg quality?  I don't think we'll be doing the next retrieval until early September, so I've got some time to add in supplements, etc.
* start exercising (just walking, and I just changed my work schedule to work from home four days a week, so it's not like I have any excuses at this point)
* any other tests that might help?  I don't think I've had any insulin testing done, so I'd like to ask for that, as well as anything else that might have affected implantation.

Any ideas for what might work the best?  I'm kind of willing to throw anything at it that might help, but I don't want to do anything that would hurt, or that would be too much of a pain for too little potential reward.

Just to confirm where things were at in my cycle, he did an ultrasound and blood test right then and there. (First time my husband has been around for the dildocam too, so that was good for him to see... he was totally fascinated.) U/S indicates that I ovulated which they will confirm when the blood test results come back.

He agrees with my old doc that probably my follicular development is out of sync with the rest of my cycle, so what we first thought were cysts may actually be follicles.

He does not agree that this means we should necessarily move to donor eggs without at least trying IVF first. He checked that we were counselled on the shitty odds, which we were, so it's not like we're going in expecting to get much, but even if we can get an egg or two we can at least try and maybe get a little more information about what's going on.

So, his plan is to suppress my ovaries with estrace (starting right now, like TODAY) and then on Day 3 we can see if everything is quiet, and if so we can then see if we can grow anything. We aren't expecting much so we won't cancel if we don't get much.

Oh, and after the barrage of information, he's like ""If you have any questions, you have my email address.""  I have his email address!

It may not work, and I know that, but I cannot tell you how much better I feel that my doctor is not giving up on my decrepit ovaries without a fight.
