Enter two REs that I interviewed. Both have unique refund programs. In short, one RE (let's call them RE#1) offers a 50% refund at a lower cost than RE#2, whose program is more expensive  but refunds 100% of program fees after 3 cycles. 

Here is the breakdown of the programs. We are doing PGS freeze-all cycles by choice. We will pay cash for any FET costs the program doesn't cover out of pocket)all programs require you use all FETs possible as a result of one ER before proceeding to the next) so let's just pretend they don't exist in the equation.

&nbsp;

I just don't know what to do.

&nbsp;

*Thoughts:*

1. We've never done this so we have no idea what will happen
2. Because of my age and other factors the Dr pegs our chances at around 60% per ivf cycle.
3. The refund is attractive but because of the plan's higher rate you have more money on the line with early success.
4. We will fund all of this with a loan, outside of FET costs

&nbsp;

I basically have analysis paralysis and am freaking out. Please, please help.

19,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey everyone. I have a visit to see a new RE and I just wanted some advice on what I should be trying to get tested at this point, etc.

Saw first RE last year, CD3 labs were good, HSG clear, AMH and AFC were a little on the high side. RE said she thinks I maybe have PCOS but not sure. I know when I ovulate (temping, OPK) and have consistent period, but I'm fluffy and my insulin and testosterone labs were high-normal. She put me on steroids and letrozole for timed intercourse and then did 4 IUIs, first one ended in chemical. Met with her after 3rd IUI in February and she told me she doesn't know what the next step should be since she doesn't think I need IVF, but no middle ground with injectables because of alleged PCOS. Felt like I had no real plan with her so I left.

Saw 2nd RE in March and she basically told me the same thing with no middle ground. Did 2 ultrasounds (CD3 and CD10) and decided she didn't think I had PCOS but just polycystic ovaries and was more unexplained. Told me my weight could be the problem or my husband has pretty good SA but has a slightly higher than average slow motility so that could also be the issue. She put me on a keto diet and I read It Starts with an Egg and both husband and I followed the plan in the book. I left her practice because of her lack of weekend availability and some other things I just didn't like.

In waiting to see new RE I had a miscarriage at 6.5 weeks following low but nicely rising betas. I'm still in my first cycle post miscarriage so things are a bit wonky and I'm hoping it won't affect my tests with him. So here's my sort of plan:

I want to find out about RPL even though I've had 2 losses and not 3, which seems to be standard before testing. I also want new CD 3 labs since mine are over a year old at this point. Last thing I was thinking is requesting a hysteroscopy. Is there anything else I should ask for?

I have a visit to see a new RE and I just wanted some advice on what I should be trying to get tested at this point, etc.</p>

<p>Saw first RE last year, CD3 labs were good, HSG clear, AMH and AFC were a little on the high side. RE said she thinks I maybe have PCOS but not sure. I know when I ovulate (temping, OPK) and have consistent period, but I&#39;m fluffy and my insulin and testosterone labs were high-normal. She put me on steroids and letrozole for timed intercourse and then did 4 IUIs, first one ended in chemical. Met with her after 3rd IUI in February and she told me she doesn&#39;t know what the next step should be since she doesn&#39;t think I need IVF, but no middle ground with injectables because of alleged PCOS. Felt like I had no real plan with her so I left.</p>

<p>Saw 2nd RE in March and she basically told me the same thing with no middle ground. Did 2 ultrasounds (CD3 and CD10) and decided she didn&#39;t think I had PCOS but just polycystic ovaries and was more unexplained. Told me my weight could be the problem or my husband has pretty good SA but has a slightly higher than average slow motility so that could also be the issue. She put me on a keto diet and I read It Starts with an Egg and both husband and I followed the plan in the book. I left her practice because of her lack of weekend availability and some other things I just didn&#39;t like.</p>

<p>In waiting to see new RE I had a miscarriage at 6.5 weeks following low but nicely rising betas. I&#39;m still in my first cycle post miscarriage so things are a bit wonky and I&#39;m hoping it won&#39;t affect my tests with him. So here&#39;s my sort of plan:</p>

<p>I want to find out about RPL even though I&#39;ve had 2 losses and not 3, which seems to be standard before testing. I also want new CD 3 labs since mine are over a year old at this point. Last thing I was thinking is requesting a hysteroscopy. Is there anything else I should ask for? This RE is in the same practice as my first RE and I&#39;ve lost almost 25lbs since I was last weighed in there so I&#39;m hoping that helps my situation. I just want to make sure I&#39;ve got my bases covered and have a plan before going in.</p>

My partner and I live in New Zealand, which has a public heath care system that will actually cover infertility treatments... with a few caveats. To apply for eligibility, couples must have been trying for at least one year. If they don't qualify after one year, they get shunted to the 'try for 5 years' category.

Once a couple qualifies, the waiting list is over a year long. With my diminished ovarian reserve (5.7 pmol/L = 0.8 ng/mL), waiting two years (or SIX!) seemed like a bad idea, so we went ahead and did a round of IVF out of pocket with the hopes that it would be successful, or that we could use public funding in September 2018.

Unfortunately, my rapidly dwindling egg supply is not factored into the qualification decision. So all we're working with is my partner's low morphology & low motility issues. We're getting all of our tests redone to submit for our eligibility assessment... which means we're in the weird position of crossing our fingers for REALLY bad results.

Of course this is happening while we're taking a break from embryo transfers, so even though there's NO DAMN WAY we'll get knocked up the ol' fashioned way, I'd rather not stick him in a hot tub to stew for a few hours.

Background: I am 27, and my husband and I have been trying since June of last year. We had a sperm scare a few months ago, but it turns out that a fever my husband had really affected his SA results. During this time, my OB had me do an HSG which came back normal.  We kept trying with no results, and I finally moved to an RE.  My RE did the initial CD3 blood work (which was done on CD2), and I was told by my RE that I have a low AMH, and a slightly elevated FSH.  My stats are:
 
AMH: 0.754
FSH: 10.6
AFC: 11 
 
My RE gave me two options: (1) we could do three medicated IUI cycles or (2) IVF.  She recommended that if we hoped for a bigger family, that we should go straight to IVF but that the choice was completely mine.
 
My SIL made an appointment for me (with my permission) with a Reproductive Restorative Medicine doctor and a nurse.  I had the appointment a few hours ago, and now I have some questions. I have an IVF consultation appointment this Wednesday, and a second opinion appointment (made after discovering I had these questions) next Tuesday. 

The RRM professionals told me a few things that I want to run by all of you, because I truly respect your opinion as unfortunately, some of you have been through this and I am hoping you can shed some light. 
 
(1) They told me that an AMH/FSH/AFC number is indicative of how successful an IVF cycle will be, and not my egg supply.  They told me that a series of FSH numbers would be more accurate in determining whether my egg supply is diminishing. 

(2) They told me that you could lower your FSH. I currently have very light/short periods and barely any cervical mucus.  This change came about three years ago. Prior to that, I had regular periods, and cervical mucus.  They told me that it is possible that whatever is causing the light/short periods and lack of CM could be causing my ovaries to work harder and increase my FSH.  Could this be true? Can a follow up test show me a lower FSH if I address other issues? My other hormone levels were all within the higher/lower end of the “normal” reference range (e.g. testosterone at 46  (range was 8-48), glucose at 97 (range was 65-99), hemoglobin at 5.6 (range was 4.8-5.6), vitamin D at 30 (range was 30-100)). 
 
So now, I am confused. I am wondering if this FSH level was wrong and I should do another one. I haven’t had my AMH/FSH/AFC looked at before, so I’m not sure if it varies often.  Any insight is very much appreciated.

I assure you that I read this sub-reddit all the time and constantly send positive vibes each your way. I just usually don't feel like I have any worthwhile insight. I say this, as I don't want it to seem like I'm just dropping in and posting something without regard for the community. I value and cherish this community. 

Anyway, the spark notes version of my infertility saga is that we started trying in January of 2016, I never got a period, figured out I have a mild ovulatory disorder, except I've been ovulating on medicine for over a year, and I'm still not pregnant. We did four timed-intercourse cycles with Clomid, 1 IUI with Femara & trigger, and 3 IUIs with Femara, Menopur & trigger. All of which came back negative. 

My body has a history of being slow to respond to meds: for each of my cycles with meds, it took me until, on average, about CD28 to ovulate. 

Okay, fast-forward to now, and the feeling of the floor falling out from beneath me. I started my first IVF cycle in May, with the BC protocol. I got off of the BC on June 20th and started my sims on June 24th. I'm started with Gonal-F @ 150, Menopur @ 75, and Dexamethasone @ 25. 

I have a high AMH and, usually, tons of follicles, so they assumed that I'd retrieve a lot of eggs. However, when I went in on my 5th day of stims for an US, I have only 4 follicles on each side, all of which were between 4-6mm. I got a call later that night to increase my Gonal-F to 225. Since then, I've been spiraling out.

I just feel like I've been conditioned for things not to work out, and now the IVF process is looking so much more bleak than what I had originally envisioned. It's like my entire life is hanging in the balance, and all I can see is fog. I'm waiting anxiously for my ultrasound tomorrow, but it'll already be day 8 of stims, and I feel like I'm nowhere NEAR retrieval. 

Moreover, I'm still spotting since having gone off of the BC. My periods usually last 4 days, maximum. 

I thought I was doing OK and handling it well, but at the first sign of something not going all right, I'm just completely losing it and envisioning myself old and alone. I just feel like I'm seeing the world through a haze and I can't snap out of it. 

I don't know exactly what I'm looking for from all of you. I think I just needed to say it all out loud. I think I also am looking for any insight you all can provide. I just feel like we're not going to get to the point of having any embryos. As in, we'll have so few eggs that in the attrition of stages, we'll have done all of this for nothing. And then I feel like all of my negativity is hurting our chances of developing eggs. I'm supposed to be in this zen bubble of calm right now, and I'm a maelstrom of anxiety. 

So sorry for all of that text. Thanks for reading, if you've gotten to this point. Again, I just feel lost. None of my friends understand. They look at me like their worst nightmare manifested in front of them, and they only talk to me about fertility as a way to reassure themselves that their reproductive systems are different than mine.

Edit: Second US was much better: 6-8 follicles on either side. My E2 levels, however, are still abysmal, at 85. They doubled my Menopur and started me on Cetrotide.

<p>Anyway, the spark notes version of my infertility saga is that we started trying in January of 2016, I never got a period, figured out I have a mild ovulatory disorder, except I&#39;ve been ovulating on medicine for over a year, and I&#39;m still not pregnant.

After our wonky hcg rising at the start of beta testing, we had an ultrasound a week ago that showed a sac in my uterus. We had another ultrasound today to see if there was any progress. The sac had grown significantly but there is not yolk sac, no fetal pole, nothing to indicate that this could be a viable pregnancy. I am heart broken and confused. 

For those of you who don't know my history, I conceived without the use of any intervention in February of 2015. I carried that pregnancy to 24 weeks and 3 days due to cervical incompetence and had an emergency classical c-section because the baby was breech and we wanted to give her the best possible chance of living. She died after we withdrew care following 2 weeks in the NICU. 

I had a transabdominal cerclage placed in January 2016. I had a chemical pregnancy last summer, almost exactly a year ago. We've done 2 IUIs and now 2 FETs. 
My dr has done the ERA test prior to the first FET. 
The first FET resulted in no positive at all. With this one, my numbers did start doubling following the first week or so of abnormal slow rising. 

We have 2 high quality embryos left. I feel like we are just flushing perfectly beautiful embryos down the toilet and I don't know what to do next. My Dr. wants to do a D&C so she can test the tissue for diagnostic purposes. We also drew blood today for the fertilome test which is extremely new but may give some insight to what's going on as we've hit a wall and really have no idea what's going on. 
It's so very frustrating that I was able to conceive and now I can't.

The gonal was every other day before IUI, along with 5 days of letrozole instead of clomid. I'm in the two week wait - test date is our 10th wedding anniversary so that's just dandy. Doc says maybe one more IUI with gonal more frequently - we'll see how #4 goes.

Now that the nitty gritty is out of the way... Today I went in for labs to check progesterone - no phone call yet so I guess it's all good - I started thing about how if this one doesn't work and then #5 doesn't work then it's off to IVF which is real reality soon. I'm trying to mentality and emotionally prepare myself for the possibility of IVF.

I talked with the husband and our insurance deductible is only $3000ish to go till the end of the year - which is good, we will most likely hit that. This IUI (#4) and the next (#5) *might* make that amount. Then if we have to go to IVF the deductible is met for the rest of the year. BUT, I had a thought - why not just skip to IVF sooner to have more chances at something more expensive before we hit the end of the year. Then we can start January with another IUI trial before jumping back to IVF if things still don't work by then - can you tell I'm a planner? Or just crazy...

However, I'm missing some information that might help make this decision one way or another - how many months does one round of IVF take? With my IUIs so far it has been like clock work - 28 day cycle and period starts the day after I go off of the progesterone. Is IVF like this or does it take months to do one round? (IUI #4 test date is early July which means if we do IUI #5 the test date will also be early August - that gives us August-December to do IVF according to my calculations).

We are unexplained as to why we are at round #4 with no pregnancy. So IUI doesn't seem like a bad option, but I really need to mentally and emotionally prepare myself for IVF - this past month has been really hard on me and I feel like I'm slipping into a bit of a depressive state. I've debated taking a month off but with this new information on our deductible that may be a pipe dream. 

We aren't hard up for money but we *only* have $20k in our HSA (health savings account) so I want to spend wisely and use the insurance in my favor - isn't it sad when $20k looks like nothing when doing fertility treatments.

Then we can start January with another IUI trial before jumping back to IVF if things still don&#39;t work by then - can you tell I&#39;m a planner? Or just crazy...</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m missing some information that might help make this decision one way or another - how many months does one round of IVF take? With my IUIs so far it has been like clock work - 28 day cycle and period starts the day after I go off of the progesterone. Is IVF like this or does it take months to do one round? (IUI #4 test date is early July which means if we do IUI #5 the test date will also be early August - that gives us August-December to do IVF according to my calculations).</p>

<p>We are unexplained as to why we are at round #4 with no pregnancy. So IUI doesn&#39;t seem like a bad option, but I really need to mentally and emotionally prepare myself for IVF - this past month has been really hard on me and I feel like I&#39;m slipping into a bit of a depressive state. I&#39;ve debated taking a month off but with this new information on our deductible that may be a pipe dream. </p>

<p>We aren&#39;t hard up for money but we <em>only</em> have $20k in our HSA (health savings account) so I want to spend wisely and use the insurance in my favor - isn&#39;t it sad when $20k looks like nothing when doing fertility treatments. Ugh! Let me know your thoughts and info about how long IVF takes to go through once. Thank you for the help!</p>

So, I haven't posted here much but I read the sub almost every day and you guys have helped me through so much of this totally crap ass time. I'm so appreciative of all of you and I wanted to share some info about our first IVF cycle in case this could help anyone else.

Just a little background, we are about a year and four months into treatment with an RE. I'm 34, husband is 36. I was diagnosed with DOR last year with AMH = 1.8, FSH = 10, AFC = 10. We did 5 monitored cycles of femara, three of those with IUI. We then moved on to IVF and I just had my egg retrieval this morning.

In the table is my estradiol (pg/mL), Gonal-F (IU), Menopur (IU), Ganirelix (mcg), Ovidrel (mcg) for each day. I took birth control pills for 30 days before we started stims, ending 3 days before the first injection, so I called that day -3. We are doing PGS so this is a freeze-all.

They told me to expect 6-12 eggs and they actually got 15! I don't remember anything between them saying I was going to sleep and waking up in recovery. I bawled my face off when I woke up which they said was a side effect of the anesthesia. Tomorrow they will call and tell us how many were mature and how many fertilized. 

A few thoughts about the injections: The gonal-f was a piece of cake (glad it's the ""starter"" injection), the menopur burned quite a bit going in, and the ganirelix hurt *after* it was in. For those reasons we always did them in that order. It was very overwhelming at first because it seemed like there was just so much more to go. About midway we started using ice before and a heating pad after, which made a difference, but then my nurse told me that she didn't like the ice because it could slow the travel of the meds. She said the heat was fine but I got paranoid about that too and so we stopped both. I found that pressing and rubbing in small circles on the injection site right after helped a lot. I got progressively more sore around the injection sites as time went on.

I had a weird hive-like reaction to the ganirelix on the first day. After that we made sure to flick the syringe gently so that there weren't any drops of liquid on the needle, and we never had the issue again. I used one of those grip squeeze things to help during the menopur (maybe I'm closer to being able to do a pull-up now!). We did all the injections on my abdomen, a few bruised but most just look like tiny dots now. 

For side effects, toward day 8 or so I started having pretty intense fatigue, especially right after the injections. In the last couple of days I started getting head rushes when I stood up. I've been drinking a lot of gatorade. In the last several days I could definitely feel that something was going on in my lower abdomen but it was never too bad. They told me it would take a few days to feel back to normal. 

I hope this is helpful for those of you going through this too, or just curious to hear one data point about what it's like. If you have any questions or just want to talk about anything, feel free to respond to this or send me a PM.

I am closely aquainted to two women who have both had abortions. And I wish I didnt know these women but I cant avoid them...


Just a little background on me. 32 pcos and mfi. We have actively tried with metformin and clomid when we first got married circa 2009. I had the pcos diagnosis long before we married so we knew it would be a struggle. 

During our previous attempt i was open with these ladies about my struggle. While on vacation with husband one of these women had an abortion. She actually waited for us to leave and had woman #2 take her. When I got back she confessed. I was heartbroken. We were a young couple but would have adopted. 2015 when #1 got pregnant again (and decided to keep it). She confessed that woman #2 had an abortion about three years after her but woman #2 wouldnt tell me because of how I reacted to #1. For reasons I cant disclose I just can not cut these women out of my life like I wanted to when I found out. These were not medically necessary. 

I am actually pro-choice, but I felt so damn betrayed that these women who knew I was struggling and are still so close to me didnt want to tell me and didnt want to even consider me raising their unwanted child. 

Fast forward to now. #1 had a beautiful baby girl that I love to pieces, and #2 has had a boy that i dont get to see as often as i had hoped. (Both dads are long gone too) And husband and I are ready to try one last time and starting femara soon. I was so ready and happy to share this with #1 and #2. But suddenly (it seems very over night) both #1 and #2 are in great relationships again. One is even talking marriage already. And they are both trying to get pregnant now.... And I know they wont struggle.

Ugh. I really hate these women right now. What little hope I had for strong physical emotional support from these women is gone. Gone are my plans to share our journey. Gone is even my hope that I get pregnant. I wouldnt want to share their spot light. If we are successful I wont tell them. I will let them hear it through the grapevine. 

My goals remain the same though. Try femara for me and clomid for husband, for as long as we can medically withstand. No iui, no ivf. And if a year passes then uterine ablation and ligation. But I still struggle in silence around these women. I so wish I didnt have to know either of them... I dont think hate is a strong enough word for what I feel right now.

I am brand new to this- like so new that I still get confused with all the acronyms and feel like this all happened very quickly. My nurses and office suck at explaining/calling/following up (it's the best hospital in NE go figure). I can't even get in touch with my nurse right now and have been waiting for 2 hours for another nurse to call me after her very unspecific voicemail saying ""you can start your injections for menopur tonight."" 

Anyway... I am looking for tips on how to travel with this stuff. I have a wedding in another state at a family farm on Saturday from 2pm - 7pm, then after party. I have to be completely present for this as this is one of my best friends. 

We have to park at the hotel, then get a bus to the farm, which then brings us to the after party later that night. That means I will not have access to the hotel fridge or any privacy to do this. What are your suggestions. I start today so I am not sure how quickly I can do this or how much space I need or really anything more than a flat surface not filthy.  I can't imagine there will be anywhere I can do this privately. Its the husband's home so their kitchen will be in use, etc.

Is it crazy of me to consider ubering back to the hotel then meeting people at the party or am I way overthinking this and it's really not as bad. I just don't want to make a scene with not going on the bus as it will be very noticeable and idk, just is.

Thoughts?

Edit: So I got home last night, my sister came over to help me. She is a nurse at the same hospital as the infertility clinic. Does not work directly with that office, but has a general sense of knowledge.

We sit down and open the package and realize... there is no menopur. Aftre a 10 minute search, thinking that I did something wrong, I realize to my horror that it is now 9PM, hours after I was supposed to take it, and I don't have the drug. I have everything else -ovidrel, crinone gel, aclohol wipes, disposer, but NO menopur.

Turns out, after calling the CVS caremark, that my doctor never put in the prescription. It showed ""approved"" but he never sent that and without it, they couldnt fill and send it... Also - they had sent the wrong drug - Gonal-F which I was told NOT to take by the on call nurse (mentioned below)

You can't make this shit up. We call every pharmacy, we call caremark, the on call nurse the hospital, everything, but most offices are closed so they can't fill a prescription and as you know, this is not something an open CVS pharmacy can do because it is a specialty drug. Finally we get in touch with an on call pharmacist at another pharmacy that takes my insurance. He is 45 minutes away and he offered to fill it and have a CURRIER drop it off for me! Amazing. This is after 3 hours, two tubs of ice cream and a lot of frustration. I can't imagine what would have happened if I did not have my sis there with her knowledge. I would have just assumed there were no other options and waited. But she knew better.

I end up getting the drugs at 1AM. The on call nurse said take it anyway, bc the first injection time is not the most important as long as you are on schedule after that. My husband helped me through it, but it was so scary and I have to work on the whole needle thing and dosage as I may have screwed that part up a bit :/.

I sent my doctor a message at 10PM. It is now 12:17pm and I havent heard back...

That's it with them...

(Also the nurse made clear that menopur had to be refridgetated bc i brought up the wedding concern. Welp - she's wrong. It does not.)

I am starting an IVF cycle if IUI #3 doesn't work or is cancelled again (and really those are the only 2 realistic things to expect). That means I would likely be starting the IVF cycle in August. I'm working with a couple of time constraints:

* I will be out of town for 5-6 days around labor day weekend, so I need to time things so I don't require monitoring during this time frame. 
* My insurance plan year ends 9/30. I didn't realize it was so soon, my bad. 

The plan year is relevant because I have a not insignificant annual infertility coverage limit that I am nowhere near. I will probably still have the same coverage next year, but I don't want to ""waste"" this year's coverage if I can help it. I talked to my nurse and she says this is probably all do-able, but they can't promise a retrieval before 10/1 because it just depends on too many factors and is a quickly approaching deadline. (I can't start IVF this month because of a vacation.)

So my question is this: If I start an IVF cycle before the end of my plan-year, but can't do a retrieval until I'm in the next plan year, will insurance (a) count it all as the new plan year or (b) split it over 2 plan years (so meds, monitoring, etc. would count for this year, but retrieval would be on the new plan year)? 

I ask because it seems like medical procedures *usually* get counted on the date they happen, even if the treatment is ongoing. But I had to have a crown done last winter right as the year was ending and I was told that if the entire crown wasn't done (i.e. the permanent one seated and finished) the *entire* procedure would count towards the new year's limit, even though it happened in the year before. 

I know the best thing here is to call my insurance company, which I will get to, but just wondering if anyone had any experience with how this works?  The reason I care is that if it's all going to get counted towards the new year anyway, then I'm not going to break my neck trying to make things happen around vacations and work.

If my current FET is not successful I have to decide if I want to transfer it. If this FET is successful I have to decide if it's worth paying to store.

My RE mentioned that while the embryo looks just as good as the 5 and 6 day embryos I had, it taking an extra day to get to that stage is not without clinical implications. Some online searching led to info indicating that 7 day embryos have lower success rates. Here's a study: https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12958-016-0157-x

The study states 7 day embryos have a higher aneuploidy rate. They don't mention miscarriage rates being higher but I would venture a guess that they are for this reason.

7 day embryos can lead to successful pregnancies of healthy kids and I found plenty of anecdotal evidence of this online as well. In the study linked above, 2 of 15 7 day embryo transfers resulted in successful pregnancies.

The other concern is that I am participating in a shared risk IVF program. Generally you have to use all your stored embryos before another retrieval, but in this context my RE indicated that they can make exceptions to this rule. This gave me the impression that if we feel strongly against transferring it, we will be able to move on to another retrieval.

The tiny, stupid, optimistic voice in my head still thinks, gee if this transfer doesn't work out and you opt for another retrieval, there could be lots more embryos for multiple potential children for just the cost of meds! (Actual cost probably includes my sanity.)

3. How does the author use language and imagery to bring the characters to life? Did the book's characters or style in any way remind you of another book?     

4. What do you believe is the message the author is trying to convey to the reader? What did you learn from this book? Was it educational in any way?     

5. Why do you think the author chose the title? Is there a significant meaning behind it?     

6. Is there a part of the novel you didn't understand? Are you confused by a character's actions or the outcome of an event?     

7. Do you think the setting, both time and location, played a large roll in this novel? Could it have happened anywhere, at anytime? If so, how would the novel have changed?     

8. In your opinion, is the book entertaining? Explain why or why not.

It's nice to meet you all, not that any of us want to be here, but it will be nice to have a group of people who ""get it.""
My husband and I have been TTC for almost three years, we are both 28. Not long after we started our journey, and only several months after stopping birth control, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and PCOS. It took about a year to get my thyroid under control, and then we had to wait another 9 months of TTC before I could get a referral, as they thought my corrected thyroid would fix my fertility issues. We tried metformin and the provera to ""reset"" by cycles but I always needed provera to get a period. 

I was finally able to get a referral to an RE last August. We did an HSG and then a lap in November the lap found a large cyst pulling my ovary away from my tube, endometriosis, lots of scarring, a uterine septum, and a fallopian diverticulum. I'm not sure how so much went wrong. We have since done a round of clomid (no response) and two rounds of Femara (+OPK but no success) with no monitoring. 

Next week we start a combination cycle of Femara, Gonal F, Ovidrel, Timed intercourse, and progesterone. Our insurance covers no meds and very little for fertility treatment, so we can only afford a few months of this before we have to give up.

Hey guys! So I'm on mobile and writing on the fly so please excuse typos, will edit when I get home!

Just had an idea. Wanted your input and maybe your help!

I've suffered through 2 miscarriages during two years of TTC. It was hell. And one thing I learned, as you have, is lots of people suffer through baby loss and infertility but are afraid to speak about it.

So here's my idea (and if you hate it please shoot me down, I'm ok with it fizzling out here)

Wouldn't it be great if there was a subtle, universal marker women and men could wear that denotes you have dealt with or are dealing with these issues? Like a pin, or ribbon or piece of jewlery? And that way other people who are dealing with these issues can connect with you if they like?

Thinking it should be something people can make on their own if they wish, kind of like the 'pussyhats' that were popular around the U.S. inauguration. I just love the idea of a subtle way of saying ""I know infertility and baby loss are hell. I'm personally connected to the issue and will talk if you want."" Ok, posting this without even checking for typos. Would love to hear your thoughts and maybe your ideas for some sort of symbol we can create!

The normal wait is about six to nine months months, but I got lucky and the clinic had a cancellation shortly before I called in. 

I was diagnosed with azoospermia after only one SA, but regardless I had been preparing for the worst for my visit. A few days before my appointment I got a call from my father saying that my mother was not doing well after a minor surgery, so I made the three hour drive home to be with her. Turns out she was doing a lot worse than my father made it out to be, and she passed away last weekend. She was the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, even on her deathbed. The nurse tending the equipment in the room we were in was about seven months pregnant. She kept stopping and rubbing her belly. She didnt really do or say anything inappropriate, but I was bothered by it, which I shouldnt have been. My mom always wanted a grandchild so badly, and I was unable to provide her with one. I wanted so badly to give her one for the past few years, and in that moment I felt like I failed her.  

So then comes the wake, during which my friend brought his ten day old daughter. My wife and I have been trying to start a family for years before he was married and he is aware of my problems. This guy bothers me by default because he and his wife are both unemployed, but decided to have kids anyway. So he brings his kid, and about thirty people asked me when I'm having kids. A few even said things like ""We lost one life but our family gained another."" I was more sad and more angry and frustrated than I have even been in my life, all at once.

Next day was the funeral, which was an amazing service and my mother would have loved it, and the next day was my male hormone tests, blood tests for Y Microdeletion and karyotype testing, following by a Sperm Analysis and meeting with the urologist. My karyotype and Y-Microdeletion tests will take around nine months to come back, but the other results were available same day. 

My testosterone is extremely low. It was 4 ng/dL, and the doctor said for someone my age with my lifestyle it should be about 20 to 30. The SA was also terrible. I produced exactly 1,900 sperm, about 300 of which were high enough quality to attempt IVF. Unfortunately they didnt save them because I didnt pay $700 up front (I wasnt aware that was an option or I would have gone for it). So I have to go back and try again. The doctor said because of my hormone levels, and other things, that he believes I have primary testicular failure. My testicles have simply stopped responding to signals from my brain to make sperm and testosterone. He said it is a degenerative issue and I am already very far along, so I will likely stop making sperm and testosterone completely within a few weeks. 

The course of action is for me to attend the clinic again and freeze whatever sperm I can produce. I was told there is no treatment or medications that can increase my sperm count. Following sperm collection, I can try to see a hormone specialist for my abysmal testosterone. 

It's been a tough week and I just wanted to put this out there to remind people that although we are all struggling and are all frustrated and often angry, try to live your life as fully as you can and to spend time with your family and friends. You are all loved, and although we feel isolated at times, our struggles are not unique and there are people who understand.

I have an extra x chromosome in my DNA. She told me that I have had the potential to lose my normal sperm count and testosterone in my body ever since birth. 

She has also told me that the pain could be the body's warning system that my testicles are failing to produce the normal sperm count as it was used to for the last couple of decades. Kinda like how you show symptoms when you have the flu. That's her theory. 

I am going to start testosterone therapy soon and will see a fertility specialist for my fertility. 

Pro tip: If you are a male and your pelvic pain started out of nowhere, PLEASE go see an endocrinologist and ask for a Karyotype. People with Klinefelter are known to have certain personality issues, such as a lack of willpower (read: procrastination) and a lack of concentration. If you have something like this, then your chances are high. 1 in 500 males get klinefelter, so it's not so rare. 

Godspeed!

edit: 

One thing to note before starting: Right before I got the results of the karyotype, I seemed completely masculine which had baffled the endocrinologist. I had no man boobs, had a manly voice, had pubic hair grow, shaved facial hair every 2 days, and was attracted to women just fine. My sexual desires were also very high; sometimes I got horny beyond imagination. Yet, my testosterone levels were somehow low.

I never thought that I would pursue surrogacy, as I wanted to have the whole experience, but after 5 years of countless cycles and disappointments, we finally looked into it, and found that US surrogacy is through the roof, and not a straightforward process (you have to adopt your own baby back after the baby is born). We are now pursuing surrogacy overseas, and so far, the experience has been amazing, and it is about 1/3 - 1/2 the price of US surrogacy.

I never thought that I would pursue surrogacy, as I wanted to have the whole experience, but after 5 years of countless cycles and disappointments, we finally looked into it, and found that US surrogacy is through the roof, and not a straightforward process (you have to adopt your own baby back after the baby is born). We are now pursuing surrogacy overseas, and so far, the experience has been amazing, and it is about 1/3 - 1/2 the price of US surrogacy.

I've had IUIs done at 39, 22 (due to my clinic being closed to me on the weekend - wasted cycle), 44, and 40 hours after the trigger shot.  At all of them, including even the one at 44 hours, they could still see my follicles and I had apparently not ovulated yet.  In these cycles, I had 2, 1, 3, and 2 mature follicles, respectively, and all of them were from the right ovary except the first one which was left (and worked which is making me very superstitious).

My first IUI with that left ovary going was actually successful (although had a missed miscarriage later), so I guess I must have ovulated sometime after that one. Now waiting for the results of #4, but the next two failed, including the one at 44 hours when I still had 3 large follicles ready to go and my chances should have been really good. With that one, I requested a progesterone blood test 7 days after the IUI which came back as a really high value, even above normal for luteal phase, presumably due to multiple follicles having ovulated.

Endometriosis is a topic that’s come up on the forum and unexpectedly found itself into my life as well so I’ve been learning more about it. Celebrities like [Lena Dunham](http://www.self.com/story/lena-dunham-endometriosis-painful-new-extreme) have opened up about this problem that many don’t want to discuss. Because endometriosis combines so many touchy topics (Women! Periods! Pain! Infertility!) usually no one wants to talk about it. And it pisses me off that so little is known about this common disease, and that treatments are inadequate. This seems like as good a place as any to talk about the long-standing misogyny in the medical profession as it relates to the [origin of the word hysteria](http://academic.mu.edu/meissnerd/hysteria.html) and [history of mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480686/). 


Note that I have no medical training whatsoever, but this what I’ve learned and hope that some of it will help others on this forum because endo and infertility overlap. 


**What is endometriosis and why does it happen?**

Basically, it’s uterine lining (endometrial tissue) growing outside of the uterus. Scientists aren’t totally clear why this happens -- start with this [helpful and accessible overview article](http://www.self.com/story/endometriosis-treatments-research). 

There’s this theory about “retrograde menstruation” though other [explanations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538128/) exist -- but why does that happen? It’s not totally validated or agreed. Misplaced endometrial-like tissue acts up in response to changes in estrogen ([explanation](https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Endometriosis)) and may actually [create its own estrogen](http://www.self.com/story/endometriosis-treatments-research). It’s also becoming clearer that the [immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538128/) is involved and makes things worse. (I’m no medical professional but I’m personally betting $20 that autoimmune fun is involved.) Endometriosis is estimated to affect [176 million people](http://medical-clinical-reviews.imedpub.com/endometriosis-and-assisted-reproductive-technology-a-review-article.php?aid=18895) and about [10-15% of reproductive-aged women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538128/) worldwide. It tends to run in some families so there is likely a [genetic component](http://www.ominecaexpress.com/news/groundbreaking-discovery-uncovers-key-to-understanding-endometriosis/), but actually newer research indicates [epigenetics](http://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2014/03/endometriosis_bulun_dyson/) is involved.

 

**What are the symptoms of endometriosis?**

If you’re hanging out here on /r/infertility, this could be you, even if you don’t think so yet.

**Does endometriosis affect fertility?**

A good number of people with endometriosis are fertile and have children without problems. However, many experience mild to severe infertility. The severity and location of the endometriosis may determine the impact on fertility. Some say 30-50% of women with endo have infertility, and 25-50% of women with infertility have endo ([citation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538128/)).

**How is endometriosis diagnosed?**

Doctors will generally tell you that “a lap” ([laparoscopy](http://endometriosis.org/resources/articles/laparoscopy-before-and-after-tips/) -- it’s a surgery) is the only way to diagnose endometriosis and yes, it’s the gold standard if your goal is to [definitively prove](http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis/) that you have endo. If you have endo issues outside of fertility, such as pain, getting a lap may be worthwhile. Getting surgery has obvious downsides -- in addition to pain and recovery, diagnostic surgery has risks including making fertility problems worse. Certain types of endometriosis such as endometriomas can sometimes be diagnosed through ultrasound, but an ultrasound will miss a lot. If your ultrasound comes back clean, it doesn’t say much -- you may still have endo.

 
However, if your goal is simply to get a vague indication about whether undiagnosed endo may be compromising your fertility, laparoscopic surgery may be too invasive. There’s a new test called ReceptivaDX (see [info](https://receptivadx.com/women-families/about-receptiva-testing/), [patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US7871778), [study](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6f014c/journal_club_saturday_topic_unexplained_if/)) that can test for elevated levels of BCL6. Keep in mind this is a new test, not yet well established, and not all doctors believe in it but [some do](http://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/1134499/test-for-unexplained-infertility). According to their research, when BCL6 is elevated, a follow-up laparoscopic surgery usually finds endometriosis. Specifically, the ReceptivaDX test comes back with a BCL6 score. The cutoff for endo is 1.4 according to their [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27222232): “Using this cutoff value, BCL6 was positive in 88% of cases with [unexplained infertility]. Laparoscopic examination of a subset of 65 patients confirmed abnormalities in 98% of cases; 61 (93.8%) were found to have endometriosis, 3 (4.6%) with hydrosalpinx, and 1 (1.5%) with a normal pelvis.” The higher the BCL6 number, the worse the endo. Usually this number will be used to determine how many months of Depot Lupron treatment or what other treatments you may be offered. Here is a [recent study](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6kj500/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/) about Depot Lupron before FET leading to higher success rate, especially with non-PGS embryos.

 

ReceptivaDX tests both BCL6 and beta-3 integrin so it’s superior to the older E-tegrity test which measured only beta-3 integrin -- as a result, E-tegrity would give a valid conclusion only if your endometrium was in a perfectly timed receptive phase when your biopsy was done. ReceptivaDX can give a result even if your uterine biopsy is done when your uterus is in a non-receptive phase.

 

The uterine biopsy works like this: your RE takes a sample of your uterine tissue. If you’re doing other tests like an ERA or hysteroscopy you can group these together into one procedure to be super efficient and not waste more cycles. If you are getting a uterine biopsy and you aren’t being knocked out, I recommend sufficient pain medication for this (example: 2 tylenol with codeine + 3 valium worked for me).

 

**I don’t want to do Receptiva or a lap (insurance/time/money/access/too-experimental) so what should I do?**

Especially if you’ve had multiple IVF failures or some other endo symptoms, you may want to go ahead and treat it (details below). I have heard that several clinics give up to 3 months of Depot Lupron to “reset the lining” (maybe what they mean is “nuke the endo”) after multiple IVF implantation failures. It’s possible that your insurance may cover Depot Lupron even if testing isn’t covered so you may want to consider treatment even if you aren’t able to test. At the very least, tossing in some letrozole seems like low-risk.

 

**Endo sounds lousy, how do I deal with my endo for fertility purposes?**

Managing endo can be a lifelong challenge, especially if you experience a lot of pain or other symptoms. For fertility, basically, the treatment will depend on the severity of your issue. The main options are:

- **Depot Lupron**. This is the same drug (leuprolide acetate) that is used in much smaller doses as microdose lupron in some IVF cycles as a subcutaneous injection. However, Depot Lupron the equivalent of 30+ days of lupron in one shot, and is administered as an intramuscular injection, sometimes by a doctor, in increments of 1 or 3 or up to 6 months. It’s a GnRH agonist which means it stops your ovaries from producing estrogen and it’s serious stuff -- it can be like going into medically induced menopause though your doctor may put you on BCP to limit the symptoms. Some people have significant side effects -- but that seems to happen more often when people are on it for many months not just a few. It seems that side effects can be reduced in some cases by taking birth control pills or ""add back."" Some endo patients are given Depot to reduce endo pain. There is some research that suggests that Depot Lupron can help increase IVF success for endo patients but there is controversy here ([2006 study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004635.pub2/abstract;jsessionid=8821771EDBF67F7E46CD8457A7CD8116.f04t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+25th+March+from+07%3A00+GMT+%2F+03%3A00+EDT+%2F+15%3A00+SGT+for+4+hours+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience.) and its [summary](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004635.pub2/abstract;jsessionid=8821771EDBF67F7E46CD8457A7CD8116.f04t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+25th+March+from+07%3A00+GMT+%2F+03%3A00+EDT+%2F+15%3A00+SGT+for+4+hours+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience.) - endo stage not noted, [2002 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12372452) with stages II to IV, [more recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24262434) on stage III/IV severe cases). I’ve heard of it being used both before egg retrieval and before FET, and this recent study showed a [significant improvement on IVF success](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6kj500/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/) when Depot Lupron is used before a FET.
- **Letrozole (Femara)**. This is a pill that can have a small [impact on endo](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/27/3/881/640603/Endometrial-receptivity-defects-during-IVF-cycles) and endometrial receptivity. It can’t hurt to throw it in, but if you might actually have any endo, it’s probably not enough. For example, letrozole treatment took my BCL6 level down from 2.8 to 2.4. Nice try but not the 1.4 or lower that I wanted it to be so I did one month Depot Lupron before the next cycle.  
- **Assistive Reproductive Technologies (ART)**. This means IUI and IVF. Probably IVF. Many folks who have endo and experience infertility will need IVF. This helps deal with lower egg quality and can keep eggs and embryos out of the muck. If you’re doing IVF, you may also benefit from Depot Lupron. See [IVF success rates for endo patients](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/20/11/3130/2913713/Effect-of-endometriosis-on-IVF-ICSI-outcome-stage) and [decreased IUI success and mixed results for IVF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4286960/). If you’ve already tried IVF you may want to read this post about [failed transfers](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/62j7o8/info_post_why_did_my_embryo_transfer_or_fet_fail/). As endo is often associated with elevated NK cells and other autoimmune signals, you may also want to try Intralipids with your embryo transfer. When doing IVF, you’ll want your doctor to keep endo in mind when choosing a [protocol](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6g6zpr/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/) -- some doctors include microdose lupron in a long lupron, lupron stop, or [lupron flare](http://www.advancedfertility.com/ivf-low-response.htm) protocol.
- **Continuous birth control pills**. There’s some evidence that a number of weeks or months of continuous birth control pills before IVF may help with IVF success -- it helps suppress the estrogen.  
- **Surgery**. This was thought to be the [gold standard treatment](http://www.webmd.com/women/endometriosis/laparoscopic-surgery-for-endometriosis), and is commonly used to relieve endo pain (sometimes only temporarily). But for infertility, [some research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4286960/) says it could be helpful though there is now evidence that doing the surgery might [negatively impact ovarian reserve as measured by AMH](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mis/2014/654856/). Also, if you’re experiencing fertility problems, it’s not clear that getting surgery will prevent you from also needing IVF and IVF is is likely less risky to your overall fertility and health than endo removal surgery. If you’re considering surgery, you will likely want to consult several specialists and get second opinions before moving forward. There are multiple types of surgery ([excisional and ablative](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18425908)) which may be applied to different types of endo. Surgery is usually not recommended for milder cases of endo. 
- **Diet (???)**. Some recommend that an anti-inflammatory diet or low FODMAP diet can help with endometriosis. This generally means no gluten, dairy, sugar, alcohol or processed foods. Some say no meat. Soy is also thought to increase estrogen levels which feeds endo. If you’re having issues with fertility or endo pain, diet is probably an “in addition to” treatment rather than an “instead of” treatment. Using me as one tiny data point, I haven’t intentionally eaten gluten in many years and I eat very little dairy… I still have elevated BCL6 levels and infertility. No diet panacea for me. 
- **No smoking**. Some [research](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6dhw0j/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/) showed that endo patients who smoke have worse IVF outcomes than those who do not smoke. 

 

**Is this #&%! ever going to get better?**

[Some researchers](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(17\)31344-2/fulltext) are calling for more funding and a search for a real cure. Hooray! There are some organizations that are working on an ability to diagnose endometriosis through a simple [blood test](http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/blood-test-could-diagnose-endometriosis-within-a-day/8318016)! (Here’s [another](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02708-x) and [another](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2016/acs-presspac-june-15-2016/toward-a-diagnostic-blood-test-for-endometriosis.html), and [another](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/130854/) -- and another looking at [autoimmune biomarkers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27485360/).) That would be awesome. As far as I know, this is not really available yet -- it's just being developed. I hope that one day an accurate endo blood test becomes part of the standard infertility workup and maybe even well-woman checkup assuming a reliable test is developed. Some companies (like [Evotec](https://www.evotec.com/en/invest/news--announcements/p/evotec-and-bayer-advance-further-programme-into-phase-i-clinical-development-5905)-[Bayer](https://endometriosisnews.com/2020/02/04/evotec-bayer-advance-4th-endometriosis-therapy-candidate-phase-1-clinical-trials/) partnership and [AbbVie](https://news.abbvie.com/news/abbvie-announces-positive-pivotal-phase-3-data-demonstrating-investigational-medicine-elagolix-reduces-menstrual-and-non-menstrual-pelvic-pain-associated-with-endometriosis-at-american-society-for-reproductive-medicine-scientific-congress.htm)) are looking into making treatments that are more effective and less destructive. 

 

**Endometriosis myths** (see [more myths](https://amp.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/28/endometriosis-20-things-every-woman-and-every-doctor-should-know))

- You can’t have endo if you don’t have painful periods (truth: infertility is a primary symptom!) 
- You a lap (laparoscopy) is the only diagnostic tool (truth: a lap is the gold standard but there’s a new non-surgical test that shows some promise) 
- Pregnancy will cure endo 
- Tampons cause endo (actually tampon use is associated with [lower rates of endo](http://ymm.yale.edu/autumn2002/news/rounds/53803/) -- insert disclaimer about correlation vs. causation here)

<p>Endometriosis is a topic that’s come up on the forum and unexpectedly found itself into my life as well so I’ve been learning more about it. Celebrities like <a href=""http://www.self.com/story/lena-dunham-endometriosis-painful-new-extreme"">Lena Dunham</a> have opened up about this problem that many don’t want to discuss. Because endometriosis combines so many touchy topics (Women! Periods! Pain! Infertility!) usually no one wants to talk about it. And it pisses me off that so little is known about this common disease, and that treatments are inadequate. This seems like as good a place as any to talk about the long-standing misogyny in the medical profession as it relates to the <a href=""http://academic.mu.edu/meissnerd/hysteria.html"">origin of the word hysteria</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480686/"">history of mental health</a>. </p>

<p><strong>What is endometriosis and why does it happen?</strong></p>

<p>Basically, it’s uterine lining (endometrial tissue) growing outside of the uterus. Scientists aren’t totally clear why this happens -- start with this <a href=""http://www.self.com/story/endometriosis-treatments-research"">helpful and accessible overview article</a>. </p>

<p>There’s this theory about “retrograde menstruation” though other <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538128/"">explanations</a> exist -- but why does that happen? It’s not totally validated or agreed. Misplaced endometrial-like tissue acts up in response to changes in estrogen (<a href=""https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Endometriosis"">explanation</a>) and may actually <a href=""http://www.self.com/story/endometriosis-treatments-research"">create its own estrogen</a>. It’s also becoming clearer that the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538128/"">immune system</a> is involved and makes things worse. (I’m no medical professional but I’m personally betting $20 that autoimmune fun is involved.) Endometriosis is estimated to affect <a href=""http://medical-clinical-reviews.imedpub.com/endometriosis-and-assisted-reproductive-technology-a-review-article.php?aid=18895"">176 million people</a> and about <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538128/"">10-15% of reproductive-aged women</a> worldwide. It tends to run in some families so there is likely a <a href=""http://www.ominecaexpress.com/news/groundbreaking-discovery-uncovers-key-to-understanding-endometriosis/"">genetic component</a>, but actually newer research indicates <a href=""http://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2014/03/endometriosis_bulun_dyson/"">epigenetics</a> is involved.</p>

<p><strong>Endo sounds lousy, how do I deal with my endo for fertility purposes?</strong></p>

<p>Managing endo can be a lifelong challenge, especially if you experience a lot of pain or other symptoms. For fertility, basically, the treatment will depend on the severity of your issue. The main options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Depot Lupron</strong>. This is the same drug (leuprolide acetate) that is used in much smaller doses as microdose lupron in some IVF cycles as a subcutaneous injection. However, Depot Lupron the equivalent of 30+ days of lupron in one shot, and is administered as an intramuscular injection, sometimes by a doctor, in increments of 1 or 3 or up to 6 months. It’s a GnRH agonist which means it stops your ovaries from producing estrogen and it’s serious stuff -- it can be like going into medically induced menopause though your doctor may put you on BCP to limit the symptoms. Some people have significant side effects -- but that seems to happen more often when people are on it for many months not just a few. It seems that side effects can be reduced in some cases by taking birth control pills or &quot;add back.&quot; Some endo patients are given Depot to reduce endo pain. There is some research that suggests that Depot Lupron can help increase IVF success for endo patients but there is controversy here (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004635.pub2/abstract;jsessionid=8821771EDBF67F7E46CD8457A7CD8116.f04t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+25th+March+from+07%3A00+GMT+%2F+03%3A00+EDT+%2F+15%3A00+SGT+for+4+hours+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience."">2006 study</a> and its <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004635.pub2/abstract;jsessionid=8821771EDBF67F7E46CD8457A7CD8116.f04t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+25th+March+from+07%3A00+GMT+%2F+03%3A00+EDT+%2F+15%3A00+SGT+for+4+hours+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience."">summary</a> - endo stage not noted, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12372452"">2002 study</a> with stages II to IV, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24262434"">more recent study</a> on stage III/IV severe cases). I’ve heard of it being used both before egg retrieval and before FET, and this recent study showed a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6kj500/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/"">significant improvement on IVF success</a> when Depot Lupron is used before a FET.</li>
<li><strong>Letrozole (Femara)</strong>. This is a pill that can have a small <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/27/3/881/640603/Endometrial-receptivity-defects-during-IVF-cycles"">impact on endo</a> and endometrial receptivity. It can’t hurt to throw it in, but if you might actually have any endo, it’s probably not enough. For example, letrozole treatment took my BCL6 level down from 2.8 to 2.4. Nice try but not the 1.4 or lower that I wanted it to be so I did one month Depot Lupron before the next cycle.<br/></li>
<li><strong>Assistive Reproductive Technologies (ART)</strong>. This means IUI and IVF. Probably IVF. Many folks who have endo and experience infertility will need IVF. This helps deal with lower egg quality and can keep eggs and embryos out of the muck. If you’re doing IVF, you may also benefit from Depot Lupron. See <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/20/11/3130/2913713/Effect-of-endometriosis-on-IVF-ICSI-outcome-stage"">IVF success rates for endo patients</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4286960/"">decreased IUI success and mixed results for IVF</a>. If you’ve already tried IVF you may want to read this post about <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/62j7o8/info_post_why_did_my_embryo_transfer_or_fet_fail/"">failed transfers</a>. As endo is often associated with elevated NK cells and other autoimmune signals, you may also want to try Intralipids with your embryo transfer. When doing IVF, you’ll want your doctor to keep endo in mind when choosing a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6g6zpr/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/"">protocol</a> -- some doctors include microdose lupron in a long lupron, lupron stop, or <a href=""http://www.advancedfertility.com/ivf-low-response.htm"">lupron flare</a> protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous birth control pills</strong>. There’s some evidence that a number of weeks or months of continuous birth control pills before IVF may help with IVF success -- it helps suppress the estrogen.<br/></li>
<li><strong>Surgery</strong>. This was thought to be the <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/women/endometriosis/laparoscopic-surgery-for-endometriosis"">gold standard treatment</a>, and is commonly used to relieve endo pain (sometimes only temporarily). But for infertility, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4286960/"">some research</a> says it could be helpful though there is now evidence that doing the surgery might <a href=""https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mis/2014/654856/"">negatively impact ovarian reserve as measured by AMH</a>. Also, if you’re experiencing fertility problems, it’s not clear that getting surgery will prevent you from also needing IVF and IVF is is likely less risky to your overall fertility and health than endo removal surgery. If you’re considering surgery, you will likely want to consult several specialists and get second opinions before moving forward. There are multiple types of surgery (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18425908"">excisional and ablative</a>) which may be applied to different types of endo. Surgery is usually not recommended for milder cases of endo. </li>
<li><strong>Diet (???)</strong>. Some recommend that an anti-inflammatory diet or low FODMAP diet can help with endometriosis. This generally means no gluten, dairy, sugar, alcohol or processed foods. Some say no meat. Soy is also thought to increase estrogen levels which feeds endo. If you’re having issues with fertility or endo pain, diet is probably an “in addition to” treatment rather than an “instead of” treatment. Using me as one tiny data point, I haven’t intentionally eaten gluten in many years and I eat very little dairy… I still have elevated BCL6 levels and infertility. No diet panacea for me. </li>
<li><strong>No smoking</strong>. Some <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6dhw0j/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/"">research</a> showed that endo patients who smoke have worse IVF outcomes than those who do not smoke. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is this #&amp;%! ever going to get better?</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31344-2/fulltext"">Some researchers</a> are calling for more funding and a search for a real cure. Hooray! There are some organizations that are working on an ability to diagnose endometriosis through a simple <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/blood-test-could-diagnose-endometriosis-within-a-day/8318016"">blood test</a>! (Here’s <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02708-x"">another</a> and <a href=""https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2016/acs-presspac-june-15-2016/toward-a-diagnostic-blood-test-for-endometriosis.html"">another</a>, and <a href=""https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/130854/"">another</a> -- and another looking at <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27485360/"">autoimmune biomarkers</a>.) That would be awesome. As far as I know, this is not really available yet -- it&#39;s just being developed. I hope that one day an accurate endo blood test becomes part of the standard infertility workup and maybe even well-woman checkup assuming a reliable test is developed. Some companies (like <a href=""https://www.evotec.com/en/invest/news--announcements/p/evotec-and-bayer-advance-further-programme-into-phase-i-clinical-development-5905"">Evotec</a>-<a href=""https://endometriosisnews.com/2020/02/04/evotec-bayer-advance-4th-endometriosis-therapy-candidate-phase-1-clinical-trials/"">Bayer</a> partnership and <a href=""https://news.abbvie.com/news/abbvie-announces-positive-pivotal-phase-3-data-demonstrating-investigational-medicine-elagolix-reduces-menstrual-and-non-menstrual-pelvic-pain-associated-with-endometriosis-at-american-society-for-reproductive-medicine-scientific-congress.htm"">AbbVie</a>) are looking into making treatments that are more effective and less destructive. </p>

<p><strong>Endometriosis myths</strong> (see <a href=""https://amp.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/28/endometriosis-20-things-every-woman-and-every-doctor-should-know"">more myths</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>You can’t have endo if you don’t have painful periods (truth: infertility is a primary symptom!) </li>
<li>You a lap (laparoscopy) is the only diagnostic tool (truth: a lap is the gold standard but there’s a new non-surgical test that shows some promise) </li>
<li>Pregnancy will cure endo </li>
<li>Tampons cause endo (actually tampon use is associated with <a href=""http://ymm.yale.edu/autumn2002/news/rounds/53803/"">lower rates of endo</a> -- insert disclaimer about correlation vs. causation here) </li>

But maybe it will help someone.

The Pity IUI:


So as you all know I'm dealing with DOR (low AMH high FSH) 38 this yr. doctor at kaiser agreed to one pity IUI which my insurance covers. Said go to IVF. This is more than we can afford right now, so I wanted the IUI and the tests at least.

AFC at ultrasound was 3, baseline estrogen? 55, after 5 vials of Menopur for three days estrogen ? shot up to 190, did the trigger shot of HCG and dragged the husband for IUI Monday.

Before she did the IUI, and I'm on my back at the table, the NP who did the treatment was looking at the microscope and looked more concerned than I have ever seen her: 

""You have a Male Factor too.""

He's younger than I am (a couple of years or so) doesn't smoke (quit four months ago) doesn't drink (quit 3 yrs ago) drinks 3 rock Stars a day, stressful job.. But the sperm was: some deformed, some ok, not where he should be at 35.

I didn't cry. They did the IUI and I asked her to tell him what she told me, because this whole time I figured- we all did, despite a sperm count of like 21 mil on first SA that it was me and my age. NP did said it was low, but low enough for treatment. (Anything lower than 21 they won't do).



So they bring him back and he sits at the microscope. He's floored. Not happy at all. He kept looking through the microscope at his ""swimmers"" and back to me on the table, and he started to tear up.

NP says we need IVF; she wants him to take the vitamins; she discussed that with him.

She told me: usually I tell patients to to have sex today, tomorrow and the next day to maximize the chances, but scratch that you can't get pregnant with IUI.


Husband told me later that he felt ""closer"" to me that day, and now he realizes the ""urgency"" of where we are at. We discussed adoption but I explained to him the cost, years, and the real possibility of bio mom taking the money and fighting for custody (my former best friend did that with her twins, I thought differently about it so we no longer speak). 

And then I blurted out the donor egg scenario. If it came to that and since my uterus and tubes are fine, and no issues with carrying as far as we know already, I told him that's cheaper than adoption and there will be a link. But that I wanted to try with my own body first.

I was really hoping we would be able to do another IUI because the chances of this working for one shot is close to zero, and member services said six, but il ow there is MF, it doesn't seem likely.

I'm sad. And trying to figure out how to get the money to do this.

The insurance:

Kaiser Downey doc said six IUI at their clinic, that was before the labs. Doc agreed to do one and NP agreed to do one more if husband got the referral, but I called member services and they said it all depends on the doctor. If he says no mas, no mas. All they did was put in for a second opinion, and I hated to do it, but I can't afford IVF now? This is my only insurance and I can't get any riders to it until NOV. all I'm trying to do is squeeze as much out of what I have covered as I can. 

Then they told me: IUI only covered if medically necessary. Uh... Without this I can't get pregnant, that's not medically necessary?

I don't know, buyer beware if you are at Kaiser SoCal idk. I heard they are great if you are below 35 tho with no MF.

It was AMAZING. Like, SO good. Basically, I didn't feel stoned at all in my head or the rest of my body, but my vagina and vulva felt warm and tingly and wet and swollen and we both had amazing orgasms. It was the best sex I've had in months. 

I'm sharing this here, despite knowing there is lots of conflicting info out there about the impact of cannabis on female fertility (and that some folks might not approve) because for me in my situation it is an absolute godsend and maybe it will help someone else. 

Sex has never been easy for me, due to some issues in my past, and all the pressure of a year and half of meticulously timed sex and no answers as to why its not working has taken a really big toll on both me and my partner and our sex life. Sex is usually uncomfortable for me because I rarely actually get fully aroused anymore. I can have an orgasm with a vibrator but that's more like scratching an itch - a short release, not an actual fulfilling sexual experience. It's probably only a few months before we move on to IVF, but if Foria can help us have a more connected, relaxed, positive sexual experience these last few months between now and then, it feels worth it to me (and of course I won't use it after ovulation). 

In my particular case, I've found that my anxiety really seems to impact my cycles. I went off my SSRI when we started trying, and my cycles immediately went wonky, with late and unpredictable ovulation. Before we started medicated cycles I experimented with daily micro doses of edible cannabis (2.5 mg, barely enough to feel anything but slight relaxation), and actually found I had shorter, more normal cycles with it, which pleasantly surprised me because some things I'd read suggested the opposite- so I wondered if it was better controlling my anxiety that was having the impact, not the cannabis itself.  

So anyway, that is to say that in my case, I'm not that worried about the impact of extremely low dose cannabis on my cycle, especially since I'm doing medicated cycles now, and I'm excited about the potential of Foria to reduce stress in our sex life as we go through this shitshow. 

I'm also totally open to non-judgemental sharing of scientific info if folks think using Foria could be more of a problem than I'm thinking in terms of fertility (no diagnosis - still in the unexplained camp, though suspecting endo is a possibility at this point and have surgical consult coming up).

Quick background: husband has azoospermia, found enough for 4 vials, did IVF 4 times, 2 worked but lost the babies at 10 and 8 weeks, 3rd was no attachment, 4th was no transfer as they didn't survive (egg quality is now shit).  We looked at doing egg & sperm donors, but holy shit, $14K for just the eggs...no thanks.  I can't afford that.  We will be making an appointment with our fertility therapist to discuss embryo adoption soon and have applied for a grant, which we'll find out of if we got it at the end of July.  We can't afford adoption...so we're coming to the end of the road with regards to options.

Moving on - we have recently begun to take our friend's kids overnight (they call us Auntie & Uncle) and I love spending time with them.  They're 9 and 2, and our friends have a girl on the way!  Hoorah!  However, I'm going to be 40 later this year.  Going from no kids to a 9 and 2 year old is EXHAUSTING.  Don't get me wrong.  I love them to pieces and have a great time.  But I'm so thankful when they go home.  

Mr J has told me over and over he will do everything he can to have kids.  He's against fostering (why?  I have no fucking clue) and there's no possible way we can afford traditional adoption (or have the time to wait 2-7 years...lord...I'd almost be 50!).  We've had many healthy discussions about what we would want to do if we didn't have kids (travel, downsize, move to the wilderness...that kind of stuff) but he's unwilling to really think about it because he's holding onto this very small thread of hope.  

I'm wanting more and more to NOT have kids.  And this is HARD for me.  I've wanted to be a mom since I was 12.  Mr J would be a really great dad.  But I don't want this anymore.  I want to downsize (Mr J hates this idea...but we have a 2-story, 4 bedroom home and it's just the 2 of us...doesn't make sense) and then I want to travel.  I want to see the National Parks, the Wonders of the World...

I think this has carried into our sex life....well, that would indicate we actually have one...which we don't.  And lately, he chooses to sleep in our guest room rather than in our bedroom, stating that my snoring is so bad (I do snore, but this contradicts him saying that it's getting better...I've lost some weight).  Last night, I was awake when he came upstairs to go to bed.  And still he chose to go into the other room.  

It hurts.  I've told him so - he says it's just so he makes sure he gets a good night sleep and I shouldn't take it so personally.  Um hello?!?!  You choose to sleep alone.  We haven't had sex in over a year.  

I don't know what else I can do.  He refuses to go to counseling that isn't ordered by our RE...any suggestions?  I'm open to pretty much anything at this point.  Thanks.

Over five SAs, partner's counts have always been low (1-13M edit:post wash) and his motility is poor.  Despite this, he engages in pretty much every known MFI risk factor.  He takes finasteride for hair loss, even though it has known fertility effects.  He has a grade 2 varicocele but won't operate.  He drinks 40oz of coffee daily and binge drinks regularly.  He chews nicotine lozenges (16mg/d), not for replacement therapy but for their 'neuroenhancing' effects. He wears tight athletic underwear 24/7.  He does HIIT workouts daily in a full body sweatsuit, with the specific aim of raising his body temperature. He's big on much-hyped diets, currently intermittent fasting (24-48h per week) and time restricted feeding. 

We've had so many conversations and arguments about what he was and wasn't willing to give up for fertility over the last two years.  I actually cried with happiness when we decided to move on to IVF/ICSI because I thought his lifestyle factors would finally stop mattering so much. And here we are, after two FET fails, contemplating more IUIs. The resentment has crept back in. I don't mention it around here, but we did have success once five years ago, without ART.  He reminds me of this frequently (""I was doing all this stuff before and it still worked, so it must not matter much"").  He also met with a urologist who, per his report, told him nothing he was doing really made much of a difference.

I feel like I would do almost anything to get pregnant.  I've at times gone without lots of things I love -- alcohol, caffeine, long runs, orgasms. I feel resentful of his unwillingness to change his behaviors.  At the same time, I also see that my attempts to change him only add to my own frustration and unhappiness, and cloud the marriage.  So I guess, more than anything, I need help with my own acceptance process, with letting go.  My marriage should come before a pregnancy.

I know this may not apply to everyone here but maybe one or two of you will enjoy this tip.

My husband and I have to take daily vitamins recommended by our RE. His are a men's daily vitamin along with other things like CoQ10. Today I am starting on a thyroid medication that I need to take daily to help my hyperthyroidism.

I know there's a lot of pill containers like the plastic ones, but, I am usually on the run so I've come up with something that I think will help me and my husband every day.

We drink water from water bottles, ( our tap is awful!) So I've packed our daily meds in a zip lock (I reuse them) and rubber banned them to a bottle of water. The hope is not to have to sort out my meds in the morning which I've been doing a lot lately. I also want to be able to take these either at work or just in the car with me because some of them are gummies so I just eat them and go. I also want one dose with me at a time, I've left my week pill container in the car once and it melted my DHA. Plus having my water attached makes it really easy!

My period always starts with spotting. It usually lasts 2-7 days and I mark CD1 to be the first day of heavyish flow (my heaviest day is usually CD2). 

Today is my spotting day 3 and I detected some fresh blood this morning so I called my clinic. I was only supposed to schedule an appointment with a nurse so she could teach me how to use certain drugs, so I didn't think it was super important which cycle day it was (although they did tell me to call on CD1 so I kind of did. Today I  work from home so it was convenient for me to call today rather than wait if CD1 is actually tomorrow..).

Turns out we might have a chance to start IVF this month after all. We were supposed to have  to wait until the clinic opens again after the summer. Anyway, the nurse told me to come on a check up tomorrow and start stims that evening. 

Yey, I'm super exited to get this show on the road, BUT what if today isn't really CD1? The flow isn't that heavy. I wouldn't really count this as CD1 in normal circumstances. What happens if I start stims too early? It's just that if CD1 isn't today or tomorrow we most likely have  to wait until August to start. Will it ruin everything if I start stims on spotting day 4 instead of the following day, on which the flow might be heavier? How important is this stuff? They monitor the growth of the follicles anyway. If I don't get heavy flow during the night I'm going to of course tell the nurse, but I just wanted to ask if anyone knew anything about this.

My fiancee and I are trying to conceive, and were having some issues, so we decided to go get some doctors advice. The first thing we did was a sperm test, and it went... not so well.

My sperm doesn't move enough, and a little higher count couldn't hurt either.

Now we have an appointment at the hospital for this, but in the mean time, I was wondering if there is anything I could do myself to improve this.

I'm a 38 year old man, healthy weight, quite active. I ran a half marathon a while back, (on a break from running now due to my knee hurting), so I'm in good shape. I lost 100lbs over the past two years. I eat a very low carb diet, drink a ton of coffee, don't smoke, drink alcohol very infrequently and thouroughly enjoy life. No stress to speak of, apart from getting married, which I look forward to a lot and I enjoy getting the wedding together.
I'm in the process of reducing my coffee intake to a lower level because google told me it may be a factor.

So, any tips?

This would be our dream! It's the first time we feel like we have a guaranteed hope that we can have children at last, because the clinic will continue to try with your frozen embryos (either yours or donor eggs) until they are successful. Seems like most everyone we have talked to were successful on their first try, if not second. 

When we were looking to connect with parents in the US, it was truly through a network of folks that we got to talk to them to hear about the process, which reassured us that we're not going to be scammed or have trouble bringing our future babies back home. Because of this, just thought I would post here so that you can read about my experience as it happens. I'm super nervous! I will start a blog and try to document everything as much as I can.

235,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello everybody,
I thought I would update you all on what it is going on on my side of the screen. This update is mainly to thank everyone who took the time to comment on my last post and those who reached out via PMs. I read them all even if in my intense panic/depressive moment I didn't reply to all of them.

After the initial shock had subsided I collected myself, and I tried to come up with a plan with what I could do to improve my situation. 

I spoke to my GP and following his advice I wrote a letter to the gynaecologist who works at the Fertility Clinic, and I organised to meet with PALS. 

The days after my meeting with PALS I received a phone call from the Clinic Coordinator who wanted to give me the right version of the story. Apparently, the nurses had given me incorrect information as they did not know what was going on (it is always somebody else's fault when things don't go the way they are supposed to, isn't it?).

In his words, the lab working with the hospital was acquired by a bigger company that introduced major changes in the patient access and the testing procedures that they can guarantee to the hospital. 
For what it concerns my particular case, my possible 'embryos' will undergo a biopsy and will be frozen until the result of the tests is back (4/5 weeks). Apparently, this new way of testing is more accurate than the previous one, but it changes the protocol I was previously assigned (obviously). 

When we spoke (about ten days ago), I was reassured that my case was a priority for them (due to my condition that forces me to have PGD) and that my treatment should resume fast. 

Well, I waited to write this update because I knew my next period would be arriving soon and I was hoping to have good news to share with you all, as I hoped this time the treatment would happen.

Unfortunately, I received a phone call this Saturday from the same Coordinator asking me if I could provide them with a DNA sample of my mother. This request was an utter surprise as my condition was transmitted to me from my father's side, so my mother was never asked to be included in any testing. 
I told them that this was not possible, as she does not live in the country and she is not in a position where she could easily post by mail (yes, they asked me this too). 
He answered that it didn't matter, and they would proceed anyway, but this month is still a no go and to try and call next month.

People, I am at the end of hope rope. I feel like they are now openly stalling me and I have no other trick I can play to make them work differently. Next month it will be six months since I signed the consent forms since we agreed on my protocol and I still have not received any formal communication from the team informing me on how they intend to proceed.
I was only asking them to make me start with my stimulation and see how was my response. Because they could be putting me through all this misery only to discover I am not able to produce any egg and that would be the end of my IVF journey (like they were already suspecting at the beginning of the testing). 

In the meanwhile, I saw another gynaecologist from another hospital (an appointment made by a consultant who follows me for my respiratory issues - because he wanted me to get pre-pregnancy counselling) who said he would be happy to refer me to the other clinic in the country (London) if everything else fails. 
I will meet him again at the end of July, so I suppose if the situation has not progressed I will have to try that route. 
I could go to PALS again, but I am so drained and overcome with sadness that I don't think I could put my thoughts into coherent words. 

I was hoping to give a better update, but this is it. 
It's infuriating, frustrating but mostly so sad from my part. Hope is great, but I don't know how many disappointment I can still take after this. I am spiralling down to negativity.

I am 35 (soon to be 36 in September) and my husband is 38. We've been trying to have a baby for 7 years. It's so crazy that I can say that! I get regular periods, I ovulate and my husband's sperm is A okay! I've used OPK's and other cycle charting methods along the way but had to stop for my own sanity. As you can imagine, I've been bingoed many times along this journey and gone through every emotion imaginable. 
Here's a little history about our situation (Since it's been 7 years, the dates may be off some. It's hard to remember the timeline for when everything happened.)
May 2010-Got off of Birth Control (I was 28 years old)

July 2011-Got pregnant

August 2011-Miscarried at 3 weeks

August 2011-D&C performed

September 2011-September 2012-Kept trying

September 2012-October 2013-Went to a Holistic and Alternative Medicine place hoping that they would be able to help me get pregnant. Took all of the supplements they told me to.

December 2013-Saw an RE for the first time. He said I had fibroids  inside of my uterus and that I needed surgery. My husband was not keen on the idea of me having surgery, so we did not move forward with that.

December 2013-December 2014-Went to an acupuncturist on and off, took herbs kept trying and praying that God will heal me and take away the fibroids. Acupuncture was not relaxing for me. Also, during this period I had an HSG at some point which hurt like hell times a 1,000,000. It was the worst pain I ever felt in my life. Even though it hurt, it showed that both tubes were clear.

January 2015-Went back to the RE and once again they said that I still had fibroids and it looked like I had more than the last time they checked. Of course, this is not what I wanted to hear as I was hoping the acupuncture had helped. My husband and I decided that I would have the fibroid surgery in the summer since I'm a teacher.

June 2015-Had a Myomectomy (Fibroid removal). Thank goodness they only had to make 4 small incisions on my stomach instead of a big incision. They took out 6 fibroids. I recovered well and was excited about being able to get pregnant now.

September 2015-I went in for my 3 month checkup, and the RE says he sees 2 more fibroids and recommends that I have them removed. I was shocked, confused and angry and I asked the RE how could I have 2 more fibroids already. He said that they could have been hiding and that sometimes having fibroids in the uterus can change the shape of your uterus.

October 2015-Had a fibroid Hysteroscopy, which is a less invasive procedure. Instead of having to make incisions on my stomach, they were able to go through my vagina to remove the fibroids. After this surgery I decided that I wasn't having anymore more surgeries to remove fibroids. If they decide to come back, oh well. Now I have these lovely scars on my stomach as a badge of honor which can be seen when I wear a bathing suit.

November 2015-February 2016-Tried to get pregnant as the doctor said this is a good time since my uterus has been cleaned out of fibroids. I tried Letrozole for 2 months with no success.
February 2016-June 2016-Kept trying and praying.

June 2016-My Dr. retires so they refer me to another one at the clinic. He orders an HSG since it had been a while since I had one. It hurt like hell just like last time and it show that 1 tube is blocked. I'm guessing that it's blocked from possible scar tissue I have from the fibroid surgeries.

March 2016-May 2017-Kind of became numb to the whole infertility thing and somewhat gave up. We still tried to have sex around ovulation, but I was just tired of the hope that I had each month, only to be disappointed. I was trying to come to terms that I may never be a mother. I do not want to adopt as I really want to have my own biological children. Which some people don't understand because there are so many children that need adopting. 

May 2017-Decided to do IVF. We had played around with this option before, but the cost was so overwhelming that I thought we would never be able to do it. I did not want to go into a huge amount of debt for it. In December 2016 my father was hit by a car and killed while he was blowing leaves in the front of his subdivision. From his death, we received enough money to do one round of IVF without having to finance it. 

June 2017-Started my ever first IVF cycle on June 6. I decided to wait until the summer since I'm a teacher. I had the egg retrieval this past Friday. They retrieved 9 eggs, and out of those 9, 3 fertilized. Now we have to wait until Thursday to see how many make it to blastocyst. I know that IVF is no guarantee, but I really hope it's our time. It's been a long 7 years and I don't know how much more I can take. I'm being cautiously optimistic and realizing that it may not work, but I really feel like this is our time. I hope and pray it is. 

If you've made it this far congratulations and thank you for reading my post! Thank you in advance for your words of encouragement.

We&#39;ve been trying to have a baby for 7 years. It&#39;s so crazy that I can say that! I get regular periods, I ovulate and my husband&#39;s sperm is A okay! I&#39;ve used OPK&#39;s and other cycle charting methods along the way but had to stop for my own sanity. As you can imagine, I&#39;ve been bingoed many times along this journey and gone through every emotion imaginable. 
Here&#39;s a little history about our situation (Since it&#39;s been 7 years, the dates may be off some. It&#39;s hard to remember the timeline for when everything happened.)
May 2010-Got off of Birth Control (I was 28 years old)</p>

<p>July 2011-Got pregnant</p>

<p>August 2011-Miscarried at 3 weeks</p>

<p>August 2011-D&amp;C performed</p>

<p>September 2011-September 2012-Kept trying</p>

<p>September 2012-October 2013-Went to a Holistic and Alternative Medicine place hoping that they would be able to help me get pregnant. Took all of the supplements they told me to.</p>

<p>December 2013-Saw an RE for the first time. He said I had fibroids  inside of my uterus and that I needed surgery. My husband was not keen on the idea of me having surgery, so we did not move forward with that.</p>

<p>December 2013-December 2014-Went to an acupuncturist on and off, took herbs kept trying and praying that God will heal me and take away the fibroids. Acupuncture was not relaxing for me. Also, during this period I had an HSG at some point which hurt like hell times a 1,000,000. It was the worst pain I ever felt in my life. Even though it hurt, it showed that both tubes were clear.</p>

<p>January 2015-Went back to the RE and once again they said that I still had fibroids and it looked like I had more than the last time they checked. Of course, this is not what I wanted to hear as I was hoping the acupuncture had helped. My husband and I decided that I would have the fibroid surgery in the summer since I&#39;m a teacher.</p>

<p>June 2015-Had a Myomectomy (Fibroid removal). Thank goodness they only had to make 4 small incisions on my stomach instead of a big incision. They took out 6 fibroids. I recovered well and was excited about being able to get pregnant now.</p>

<p>September 2015-I went in for my 3 month checkup, and the RE says he sees 2 more fibroids and recommends that I have them removed. I was shocked, confused and angry and I asked the RE how could I have 2 more fibroids already. He said that they could have been hiding and that sometimes having fibroids in the uterus can change the shape of your uterus.</p>

<p>October 2015-Had a fibroid Hysteroscopy, which is a less invasive procedure. Instead of having to make incisions on my stomach, they were able to go through my vagina to remove the fibroids. After this surgery I decided that I wasn&#39;t having anymore more surgeries to remove fibroids. If they decide to come back, oh well. Now I have these lovely scars on my stomach as a badge of honor which can be seen when I wear a bathing suit.</p>

<p>November 2015-February 2016-Tried to get pregnant as the doctor said this is a good time since my uterus has been cleaned out of fibroids. I tried Letrozole for 2 months with no success.
February 2016-June 2016-Kept trying and praying.</p>

<p>June 2016-My Dr. retires so they refer me to another one at the clinic. He orders an HSG since it had been a while since I had one. It hurt like hell just like last time and it show that 1 tube is blocked. I&#39;m guessing that it&#39;s blocked from possible scar tissue I have from the fibroid surgeries.</p>

<p>March 2016-May 2017-Kind of became numb to the whole infertility thing and somewhat gave up. We still tried to have sex around ovulation, but I was just tired of the hope that I had each month, only to be disappointed. I was trying to come to terms that I may never be a mother. I do not want to adopt as I really want to have my own biological children. Which some people don&#39;t understand because there are so many children that need adopting. </p>

<p>May 2017-Decided to do IVF. We had played around with this option before, but the cost was so overwhelming that I thought we would never be able to do it. I did not want to go into a huge amount of debt for it. In December 2016 my father was hit by a car and killed while he was blowing leaves in the front of his subdivision. From his death, we received enough money to do one round of IVF without having to finance it. </p>

<p>June 2017-Started my ever first IVF cycle on June 6. I decided to wait until the summer since I&#39;m a teacher. I had the egg retrieval this past Friday. They retrieved 9 eggs, and out of those 9, 3 fertilized. Now we have to wait until Thursday to see how many make it to blastocyst. I know that IVF is no guarantee, but I really hope it&#39;s our time. It&#39;s been a long 7 years and I don&#39;t know how much more I can take. I&#39;m being cautiously optimistic and realizing that it may not work, but I really feel like this is our time. I hope and pray it is. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve made it this far congratulations and thank you for reading my post! Thank you in advance for your words of encouragement.</p>

This was a day we've been waiting 4 years for. And we got the exact answers we wanted. Everything looks good to proceed with IUI. 

I thought we'd  be elated and ready to get going my next cycle (I'm 36 and don't have a lot of time to waste!) - and we were very pleased with the good news, but also left feeling torn...

The biggest factor in our infertility journey has been my husband immobile sperm. While his counts look good - they have 0 motility. Which is why I wonder if it would even be worth it to do the IUI. The dr said that the numbers were in our favor but of course he can't guarantee anything. I'm just wondering if the don't move how will the egg get penetrated?

The other option on the table is IVF with ICSI. This is compelling because the low motility wouldn't matter. Also I like the idea of being able to freeze additional embryos should we be fortunate enough to have them. Obviously the down side would be a much harder financial burden as well as a much more difficult path for me. 

Does anyone out there have a similar story? Any thoughts on how an egg can be fertilized if the sperm don't move? Dr said they will probably ""perk up"" after a wash but I still don't know if I understand how that would even happen. 

Sorry for a long post - just need to get all the details out there!

Side effects seem to be getting worse each time and I'm insanely worried whether I will even be able to finish this pack or if I'm now doing permanent damage.  I've only taken 2 of the pills so far and in addition to the usual nightly hyper-sweating, I'm having headaches with pressure behind my eyes, and this insanely uncomfortable tingling sensation that started in my left hand last night (it even woke me up from deep sleep) and has continued randomly throughout today and has gotten more constant tonight while also starting in my right hand.  I'm aware that parasthesia is a rare side effect of Clomid, but does this mean I should stop taking it and cancel this cycle?  Has anyone had this before and does it go away after stopping medication?

The 1st cycle, had no side effects aside from feeling a little odd/moody and night sweats, and I got pregnant but had a missed miscarriage.  Started back on Clomid about 4 months after the first cycle when my period finally came back, guess this gave some months for it to clear my system.  The first month back on after the MC, had no side effects aside from night sweats. The second month, I had mad night sweats every night and started to get headaches later in the day on day 4 and the day after I finished the last dose, I had a bad migraine and couldn't move my head and had to avoid bright light, had a continuing headache the next day, but then it all went away fairly fast. I recall also had one brief episode of one arm starting to go a little numb after day 5 but it went away and none of this tingling/prickly sensation.

I'm absolutely terrified of this parasthesia becoming worse over the next THREE pills I still have left to take, as the full blow of the medication doesn't even seem to come until you've finished all 5 of them, and also getting another mega-migraine although now the parasthesia has me more freaked out. This is absolutely my **last** month on this, I even asked to switch to injectables this month because of last month's migraine but the clinic convinced me to give Clomid one more try due to it having worked the first time and because I respond so well to it at the minimum dose.

For our first IUI in November, husband had 19mil count post wash. It was successful but ended in a loss.

RE recommended that he do a repeat SA. The results from that came in today, still a drastic difference from his original analysis 10 months ago.

I've recently gotten into making soy candles and melts as a way to take my mind off of things and as a possible part to a business I'm looking to start. As a writer and a lover of books, I want to theme my stuff around literary characters and books as a whole so I'm curious as to what scents others would associate with some of their favorite characters/books. 

Some are easy to come up with, if anyone reads the Toby Daye series, you'll know each faerie has a scent associated with their magic. Tybalt is pennyroyal someone else is roses etc.  so those would be easy for me to do.

<p>I&#39;ve recently gotten into making soy candles and melts as a way to take my mind off of things and as a possible part to a business I&#39;m looking to start. As a writer and a lover of books, I want to theme my stuff around literary characters and books as a whole so I&#39;m curious as to what scents others would associate with some of their favorite characters/books. </p>

<p>Some are easy to come up with, if anyone reads the Toby Daye series, you&#39;ll know each faerie has a scent associated with their magic. Tybalt is pennyroyal someone else is roses etc.  so those would be easy for me to do. </p>

I had my first RE appt yesterday, and while I was hoping the tests my OBGYN did (CD3, CD21, U/S, HSG) would have the RE saying 'Oh, you have PCOS? Let's get you on Clomid and get this show on the road!', it did not happen that way. 

He was actually skeptical of the PCOS 'diagnosis' my obgyn gave me (she said its ""likely"" PCOS, so not really a diagnosis), and also skeptical of the bicornuate uterus diagnosis. Once I told him I had an 80 day cycle last cycle, he agreed I have some sort of ovulation dysfunction and that we need further tests to show its actually PCOS and not something different.

For the bicornuate uterus, he wants to make sure it is in fact bicornuate (heart-shaped), and not septate (something to do with the shape of the surrounding muscle, i guess?). Apparently this cannot be determined by a transvaginal ultrasound or the HSG, which sucks, because the radiologist told me there was no septum and I thought that was the end of it! The RE gave me the option of a laparoscopy or an MRI, of which I chose the MRI. I'm hoping he sees what he needs to, and that there's no reason to go forward with the surgery. If he sees a septate uterus or something else unexpected and the lap is necessary, I'll prepare for that, but right now I just don't want surgery!

I go back on Monday for either CD3 blood work and U/S, or for no-period blood work and U/S (I'm on CD35 now). Then an MRI the following week, then a follow-up to discuss all the results the week after that. I'm so glad to have found this community to share with.

Just a PSA. If anyone lived on Camp Lejeune in the mid 80s to early 90s, you've probably been made aware the water was poisoned. One of the things they're recognizing as a potential effect is female infertility. They'll run some tests and if they believe your issues may have been caused by the water than they'll pay for fertility treatments as well as whatever other medical expenses your reproductive health issues may require. 

There may not be any of you who lived there then, but just in case I wanted to pass it on. We weren't even going to try IVF because it's so expensive and our odds of success still aren't great, but because of this we probably will.

<p>I know how expensive treatments are, so if this information could help even one of you I figure it&#39;s worth sharing. </p>

The insurance verification from the Shady Grove Fertility Center at Rockville MD just came through as below.

Your Blue Choice Insurance has been verified.  You have a $1,000 deductible to meet each year before your insurance will pay towards covered services.  We were quoted that IUI treatment is covered at 100%.  IVF treatment is covered at 100% with prior authorization required and a maximum of 3 cycle attempts per live birth.  Embryo Cryopreservation (freezing), storage, and thawing is not covered under this policy.
 
Cryopreservation $1,800
Yearly storage $530
Thawing of Embryos $600

I am not able to get anything on the medication part. Could anyone advice us on if I should go with the insurance for the medication or should we pay out of pocket. How do we validate the coverage from a medical perspective. And is there a life time limit on the medication part.

Appreciate your feedback, if you have experience with Shady Grove Fertility at Rockville.

Is there a medicine list available for IVF that can be validated with the Pharmacy provider that we can use to check coverage?

We also got this from the insurance validation:

Once your $1,000 deductible is met IVF is covered at 100% with a 3 cycle attempt maximum per live birth.  Things that are excluded in your coverage is listed below:
·         Freezing (cryopreservation) of embryos or sperm- $1800 at time of freeze
·         Storage of Embryos/Sperm $530 after the 1st year.
·         PGS testing- Biopsy $1500, outside lab analysis est. $2,000 (billed by lab)
Do we need to do freezing and storage of embryos/sperm. Are they required?
Any thoughts on what is this PGS testing? Is it required.

It's been a rough couple of years with lots of ups and downs. I started my first year teaching last fall which was just as rough as everyone makes it out to be. Because of the newly acquired health insurance I decided to finally see a fertility specialist. It took me way to long but I finally got all of my tests done and had the follow up today. 

&nbsp;

So here is the condensed version:

1. Both me and my husband are cancer survivors who went through chemotherapy.
2. I have PCOS which should make things difficult obviously, but not impossible especially since I will have spells of regularity. I will often have a regular cycle for 2-5 months and then have no period for 3-5 more months.
3. Both me and my husband have more than enough eggs/sperm and despite the PCOS, I can have a pretty regular cycles as mentioned above so I ovulate and can usually tell when I do.

&nbsp;

So the long and short of it seems to be that we have quantity but not quality. Dr. told us there is no really easy way to see the genetic quality of the eggs/sperm and that the fact that we both went through chemo raises our risk of genetic problems. Basically she said that even with PCOS, because my cycle can be fairly regular the fact that I haven't gotten pregnant in over two years of trying especially at my age (25) points to an issue that is maybe more genetic. 

&nbsp;

She talked us through our IVF options but I don't know that I'm ready or want to go through that whole process and my husband is  on the same page. We feel like if we're going to be spending a lot of money on a baby, we would rather adopt. I had more or less come to terms with being infertile in preparation for this but my husband is taking it pretty hard. It kills me to see him so heart broken. He has always tried to remain positive but now that he's faced with actual medical evidence, he's having a hard time adjusting.

Anyway, hello ladies. I can't say I'm particularly happy to be a part of this group now, but I can say it's really nice to have a community to go to who can understand me and my situation.
