Our first cycle I started bleeding a bit early, went in for CD 3 and they did a beta anyway and it came back at 6. It only went down from there and the Dr. said ""It's just leftover trigger.""  I do not recall if I even bothered with a home test that month because...bleeding. 

That was 2 years ago. I have gone in for a couple random betas, but have usually only gone if/when I've gotten a + home test. One was pretty legit and my beta rose for about a week. 
The second I was bleeding again, went in and it was 6 again. After the 1st legit, rising + I KNOW that the second was a pregnancy and NOT just leftover trigger. I felt it. I felt the same as the first pg. I am sure my Dr. would disagree because, again, the beta didn't rise. (I know these have all been chemicals and it sort of a moot point, but it is a tiny bit of hope that keeps me going.)

So....this month (15DPO today) I've had 3 negative home tests and have stopped progesterone, but I am feeling super anxious and guilty. Like I should have gone for my beta. But...then I remind myself - why? Even if it were to come back super low it's likely consider ""leftover trigger"" in my Drs eyes. I didn't want to drag it out any further this month because we have to get a cycle in before my husband has to travel for work again. 


I'm ok trusting my home tests, right? Its not like I was testing 9DPO. I'm 15DPO. If I weren't on progesterone I'd be bleeding naturally by now and anything even remotely plausible would have shown up, right? Right?

I apologize if this is not formatted right. My friend told me about this place. I was hoping you ladies can help me with some questions.

I am 29 years old. Diagnosed with PCOS around 20-21 years old. Went on Ortho-Tri-Cyclen Lo at 20-21 years old to regulate periods/very painful cramps until I stopped about a month ago. My withdrawal period from the birth control started July 4. I have not gotten a period since then, and I am now 3 days late for the period although for the past 3 days I have been getting bad cramps on and off again that seems very similar to the pains I got before I started birth control in my early 20s.

Also a few more things:
-I have lean PCOS
-The last ultrasound I had about 6 months ago, they couldn't see cysts on my ovaries
-I have hirsutism, hair growth on my chin and upper lip which is horribly annoying

1. My OB said that after I stop the birth control, to wait 2 cycles until I TTC. Why is that? I looked up stories online, and it seems like a lot of people tried right off of birth control, and they got pregnant. What am I missing? 

2. I am not getting my period - is it possible to ovulate but not have a period? 

3. If anyone has any advice on lean PCOS, I would be grateful, I do not see too much info online about it

4. Did anyone try PCOS diets, if so can you please give a link and tell me how much you think it worked? 

Thank you ladies so much!! Very grateful for your responses.

The new RE also has had my husband do HCG shots for the past two weeks and do a new SA today, because he thinks it was unnecessary ever to have done a testicle biopsy on him.

Well, the results came back and they are great! Well, great in that I don't think he'll need a biopsy again.

"" I have looked into that. It is on the list of things to do, regardless of whether or not a bio child happens. A biological child is still something I would like. Pretty much anyone who has ever dealt with infertility ever has been told to ""just adopt"" and it's something that A) isn't as easy as people think, and B) not for everyone. 

Plus there's the added fostering bit. While it is something I would love to do, you are putting yourself out there to help and guide a child who has been torn apart and may lash out. You're putting yourself out there to fall in love and very possibly lose that child. While at the same time have zero say in whether or not the adoption can go through. You are actually more likely to lose that child back to his or her bio parents than not. Ok, you have a little bit of say, you can say no to the possibility of adoption, but you cannot say yes and be guaranteed a child. You can take care of that child for a year or more, and then the bio mom gets clean and that child goes right back. So when you tell someone who has gone through the grieving process for their own lack of ability to have children, or potentially the ability to get pregnant but the inability to carry to term, you're also advocating the very real possibility of yet more heartbreak to someone who's already been through hell.

Traditional adoption can also mean having the rug yanked out from under you repeatedly. It also adds in the cost of about $30k, which is more than invitro and just as out of reach for people. 

I know that your advice comes from a place of caring, and for that I thank you. It's also one of the biggest facepalm pieces of advice that infertile people get constantly. Right up there with ""Just relax, it'll happen in it's own time."" Because having a uterus that's shaped poorly, or not ovulating, or having zero sperm is likely to be fixed by relaxing.

At 6 months I had some blood work done to check if I ovulate, and I do. I also use OPKs, but I don't temp. I know I need to, and am going to try this next cycle. I get up about 3 times a night to pee, and have been anxious that is going to mess everything up.

I ovulated last Thursday on CD 12, which feels kinda early to me. I have an appointment with my obgyn today, because I don't feel up to waiting for my next cycle to get some answers.

If your companies insurance does not cover you, because the company is based in a different state, it may make more sense to ditch your company provided insurance and purchase a plan that will cover you, out of pocket. 

My plan costs $480/mo., but compared to paying for treatment it's a drop in the bucket and honestly it was going to cost us the same when you totaled up how much my husbands work was going to take from each paycheck for me being on his plan. 

This might not work for everyone, but I figured if I could help just a few people!! No one seems to sit you down and tell you this, they leave it to us to figure out on our own.

This is after I woke up this morning to mom and baby cooing at each other, having some kind of dream that it was me. Lol, no! Anyway I had to stop working on my project and I had complete meltdown. I hate them so much and I do not understand what I have done to deserve this. IN MY FUCKING HOUSE, EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. </p>

<p>And while we&#39;re on the topic of people ruining the one nice hobby I have in to order retain some sanity, I post a picture of a pretty kimono I made on my Instagram and my friend is all &quot;hint hint! I need some pretty maternity wear for the summertime!&quot; Tell coworker I made the silk blouse I&#39;m wearing? &quot;Oh, well if you ever feel like making some baby clothes for me...&quot;  <strong>NEVER. I WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER MAKE YOU BABY CLOTHES OR MATERNITY WEAR. FUCK OFF. DIE.</strong></p>

<p>Anyway, I hate everything. I hope past-life Duppy had fun being an axe-murderer, because I am clearly paying for it now.</p>

I hope you are all doing great. Sorry I've been really quite since out ultimate FEt failed, even it it was expected, it still hit us hard.
It's been a shitty week at work and the stupid cold sore just got even more disgusting. When it rains, it pours, innit.

So, you always have great ideas and great suggestion.

I'm trying to make a list of things to ask on our WTF appointment.

Here is our history : we have dealing with a Balanced Translocation (2/13, unfortunately, big chromosomes, half switch place). I'm hostly ok, hypothyroid and polycystic ovaries, but not full PCOS, and got a polyp remove in jan 2015.

First IVF : Antagonist. Repronex 225 ui. Cetrotide 0.25 mg. Trigger : Suprefact. Mild OHSS (started Cabergoline before the trigger).
26 eggs (out of shitload of follicles, there was a party down there). 18 were mature.
Micro-tese was successful, not mobile sperm tho. 4 eggs fertilized for sure. 6 were on observation, we had 5 for sure on day 2. Day 5, no blast, only 2 left that were still developing. Day 6 : blasts but to shitty to do anything. So.... failure.

Second IVF : Antagonist. Gonal-F, 200 ui and Luveris 75 ui. Cetrotide 0.25 mg. Again, Suprefact as a Trigger. Very, very mild OHSS, cabergoline on the retrieval.
18 eggs this time, but only 10 matures, so not that great.
Micro-tese was awful, they did not think they found anything, but they cut deep and a lot. Embryologist spend 4 hours looking into the sample : she found 36 sperms. 2 motiles.
Only 2 eggs fertilized. The 2 embryo were perfect 8 cells on day 3.  They were frozen on Day 3.
Both FET failed.

Husband really wants to try another micro-tese. Urologist said that the results were better on his right side (first micro-tese). We want a back-up donor, that might increase our chance, and if everything is shit with a donor also, it might tell us if there is an issue with my eggs.

* So, what should I ask the RE? Is there tests I should be doing after 2 failed FET?  Autoimmune and all? 

* What can I ask about the protocol? The Gonal-F one had not great result, nearly half the eggs were immature. With Repronex, about 60 follicles, but only 26 eggs, and 18 matures. With stupid polycystic ovaries, is there a way to get better results?

* We won't do another cycle for a while. I'm not sure it do anything, but started to take COQ10, just in case, and to see a ""improvement"" it's at least 3 months.  I have a healthy weight, eat relatively clean, guess I could do more exercice... Any suggestion there? 
* Husband is taking his vitamins, not that it will do much, won't magically fixed his BT, but can't hurt... 
* There was a twiching sensation in uterus often after the FET. On the scan before the FET, they notice contractions. I guess that's something to ask, why was the thing so twitchy? An effect of the scracth?

So, sorry for the wall of text. If you have any recommendation of things to ask, do not hesitate. We are still a bit numb and depressed and not sure what we should ask at the WTF.

The next steps are scary, as everything would be out of pocket, and giving our dreadful results for far.... it all seems doomed.

I was referred here from the usually non-swearing ladies from TFAB. On Wednesday, we found out we are fighting against MFI. My SO had a vasectomy reversal in August 2015. He had a SA in January 2016 that gave us the green light to try for 6 months. No pregnancy. Fuck. We were referred to an RE and the first appt was Wednesday. She told us that the vas deferens is slowly scarring over and forming a blockage. She recommended we do a cryopreservation as soon as possible in case we do an IVF and he isn't able to produce a sample with live sperm. Total count, 2M. Motility 18%. We aren't candidates for IUI. Our options are IVF with ICSI, IUI with donor sperm or adoption.

I went in for an HSG today and everything is clear. We also did out blood work on Wednesday. I still have to go in for CD3 testing. 

We put down the deposit to get on the waiting list today. I'm hoping we are on the late September cycle but may be October. We are basically diving in with both feet.

Question - I'm leaning towards doing 2 embryos in the first transfer. If we have twins, that would be okay with both of us. Does anyone know the success rates of getting pregnant with multiples?

111,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"This is an update to [my post from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4u5jp3/canceled_cycle_waiting_on_miscarriage_2/).

I had another beta and the result was in the mid-800's. So to recap: HCG fell slightly between Wednesday and Friday, and then climbed up a little Monday, but still nowhere near where it should have been. At my appointment Tuesday, the doctor said it still wasn't viable, and my levels were just fluctuating. He was concerned it might be ectopic. We did an ultrasound, and though I was supposed to be 7 weeks he couldn't find a fetal pole or heartbeat or anything. He thought he saw the embryo but recommended doing a D&C to make sure it was and not in a tube somewhere. He also said if there was enough tissue he could run some tests. The D&C ended up being the best route anyway because I never started bleeding, meaning it was a missed miscarriage. He tested the tissue after that he extracted and it WAS the embryo, so I'm relieved it wasn't an ectopic.

I'll be honest, I was really nervous about having surgery (yes, even though I was supposed to be having an egg retrieval next week anyway). That's part of why I'm posting this update - so if anyone here ever G-d forbid finds themselves in this situation they know a little bit about what to expect. Last night I searched this subreddit for ""D&C"" and it didn't come back with much.

At my pre-op appointment I had my first breakdown over this. It was at a hospital where a friend of my husband had her baby and we went to visit a few years ago. It made me wish I was having a baby instead of this.

I got there super early in the morning, and they had me sign in and brought me to a room to get changed into the hospital gown. This hospital's protocol says every woman childbearing age needs to pee in a cup for a pregnancy test. Seems redundant, but I did it anyway. Then, the second nurse came in and said not to bother and flushed my sample down the toilet. Sigh. The ""worst"" part was the IV insertion. They gave me a numbing shot that realllllly stung, but after that I didn't really feel anything. It was a little freaky to feel the pressure of it and see a huge tube sticking out, but it was fine. My husband was then allowed to come back and wait with me. The anesthesiologist was AMAZING. I had put down that my only prior surgery (wisdom-tooth removal) left me throwing up for hours, so he gave me this patch/bandaid near my ear with medicine and I'm happy to report I felt 100% fine after. Then, my RE came in and said some encouraging things about how he was going to test my chromosomal makeup (my husband and I were both screened for being carriers of every disease under the sun when we first started this journey and all that came back compatible but I've never had my own genetic makeup tested like this). He's also going to test me for some clotting issues and see if my body could be attacking the embryos.

Many of you asked what my diagnosis was on my last post. I'm currently unexplained (actually I don't know if I've every been officially diagnosed with infertility) but I have a family history of endometriosis from my mom. She had secondary infertility and I'm an only child. I wanted to have kids young (she had my when she was 27) because I knew it was a progressive thing, but we've been trying since I was 23 and still not much to show for it. She passed away when I was 9 so I'm not able to ask her any detailed questions and my dad doesn't remember it so accurately, I think. I've never been tested for it because it would require a laparoscopy but I have some symptoms associated with it. IVF was supposed to bypass where he thought it was hiding but now I'm worried that if we do IVF the embryos won't even grow. My tests all came back healthy and so did my husbands. AMH was 3.1. I'm not sure if this incident changes our diagnosis, but as we get more results the doctor will make recommendations. Weirdly enough a recent test of mine came back with hypothyroidism, but I have no idea if that's part of my puzzle.

Anyway, my doctor left and the anesthesiologist gave me a relaxing drug before wheeling me down the hallway. I remember them moving me onto the OR table and giving me another drug to make me pass out. They kind of put it in fast so the pressure hurt a little.

Next thing I know I'm waking up in recovery and asking a nurse if he found the embryo because I was still scared it might be ectopic. She said it went well but I don't know if she knew what I meant. I don't know if I 100% knew what I meant, either, so that was okay.

I wasn't really in any pain down there. I did feel a little bit of gushing, not to be gross. However, my left hand hurt. I saw they must have taken blood for that genetic test while I was knocked out. I had slight bruising. I feel like nurses are so much more sensitive when drawing blood, and some OR tech or my doctor probably just jammed the needle into my hand while I was out because it wouldn't  hurt in the moment, but it ached when I woke up. Funny that that was the worst of my pain post-op.

They wheeled me to a room where I ate crackers and drank a little water. I napped for a little bit. The nurse had me use the bathroom before she would take out my IV. Oy. I was bleeding a little bit but nothing heavy. I changed pads and put on my underwear. She helped me get dressed (I could pretty much do everything except for hook my bra in the back because my hand still hurt). They had me take an oxy pill before I left which has since worn off and I don't feel any need to even take tylenol right now, that's how little pain I'm in. I've had periods MUCH worse than this (another indicator of endo).

They had me leave in a wheelchair because that's hospital policy. I'm not really scared of surgery anymore so if I do still end up going the IVF route that'll be a plus. Been napping today and was able to eat some pasta.

<p>I had another beta and the result was in the mid-800&#39;s. So to recap: HCG fell slightly between Wednesday and Friday, and then climbed up a little Monday, but still nowhere near where it should have been. At my appointment Tuesday, the doctor said it still wasn&#39;t viable, and my levels were just fluctuating. He was concerned it might be ectopic. We did an ultrasound, and though I was supposed to be 7 weeks he couldn&#39;t find a fetal pole or heartbeat or anything. He thought he saw the embryo but recommended doing a D&amp;C to make sure it was and not in a tube somewhere. He also said if there was enough tissue he could run some tests. The D&amp;C ended up being the best route anyway because I never started bleeding, meaning it was a missed miscarriage. He tested the tissue after that he extracted and it WAS the embryo, so I&#39;m relieved it wasn&#39;t an ectopic.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I was really nervous about having surgery (yes, even though I was supposed to be having an egg retrieval next week anyway). That&#39;s part of why I&#39;m posting this update - so if anyone here ever G-d forbid finds themselves in this situation they know a little bit about what to expect. Last night I searched this subreddit for &quot;D&amp;C&quot; and it didn&#39;t come back with much.</p>

<p>At my pre-op appointment I had my first breakdown over this. It was at a hospital where a friend of my husband had her baby and we went to visit a few years ago. It made me wish I was having a baby instead of this.</p>

<p>I got there super early in the morning, and they had me sign in and brought me to a room to get changed into the hospital gown. This hospital&#39;s protocol says every woman childbearing age needs to pee in a cup for a pregnancy test. Seems redundant, but I did it anyway. Then, the second nurse came in and said not to bother and flushed my sample down the toilet. Sigh. The &quot;worst&quot; part was the IV insertion. They gave me a numbing shot that realllllly stung, but after that I didn&#39;t really feel anything. It was a little freaky to feel the pressure of it and see a huge tube sticking out, but it was fine. My husband was then allowed to come back and wait with me. The anesthesiologist was AMAZING. I had put down that my only prior surgery (wisdom-tooth removal) left me throwing up for hours, so he gave me this patch/bandaid near my ear with medicine and I&#39;m happy to report I felt 100% fine after. Then, my RE came in and said some encouraging things about how he was going to test my chromosomal makeup (my husband and I were both screened for being carriers of every disease under the sun when we first started this journey and all that came back compatible but I&#39;ve never had my own genetic makeup tested like this). He&#39;s also going to test me for some clotting issues and see if my body could be attacking the embryos.</p>

<p>Many of you asked what my diagnosis was on my last post. I&#39;m currently unexplained (actually I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve every been officially diagnosed with infertility) but I have a family history of endometriosis from my mom. She had secondary infertility and I&#39;m an only child. I wanted to have kids young (she had my when she was 27) because I knew it was a progressive thing, but we&#39;ve been trying since I was 23 and still not much to show for it. She passed away when I was 9 so I&#39;m not able to ask her any detailed questions and my dad doesn&#39;t remember it so accurately, I think. I&#39;ve never been tested for it because it would require a laparoscopy but I have some symptoms associated with it. IVF was supposed to bypass where he thought it was hiding but now I&#39;m worried that if we do IVF the embryos won&#39;t even grow. My tests all came back healthy and so did my husbands. AMH was 3.1. I&#39;m not sure if this incident changes our diagnosis, but as we get more results the doctor will make recommendations. Weirdly enough a recent test of mine came back with hypothyroidism, but I have no idea if that&#39;s part of my puzzle.</p>

<p>Anyway, my doctor left and the anesthesiologist gave me a relaxing drug before wheeling me down the hallway. I remember them moving me onto the OR table and giving me another drug to make me pass out. They kind of put it in fast so the pressure hurt a little.</p>

<p>Next thing I know I&#39;m waking up in recovery and asking a nurse if he found the embryo because I was still scared it might be ectopic. She said it went well but I don&#39;t know if she knew what I meant. I don&#39;t know if I 100% knew what I meant, either, so that was okay.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t really in any pain down there. I did feel a little bit of gushing, not to be gross. However, my left hand hurt. I saw they must have taken blood for that genetic test while I was knocked out. I had slight bruising. I feel like nurses are so much more sensitive when drawing blood, and some OR tech or my doctor probably just jammed the needle into my hand while I was out because it wouldn&#39;t  hurt in the moment, but it ached when I woke up. Funny that that was the worst of my pain post-op.</p>

<p>They wheeled me to a room where I ate crackers and drank a little water. I napped for a little bit. The nurse had me use the bathroom before she would take out my IV. Oy. I was bleeding a little bit but nothing heavy. I changed pads and put on my underwear. She helped me get dressed (I could pretty much do everything except for hook my bra in the back because my hand still hurt). They had me take an oxy pill before I left which has since worn off and I don&#39;t feel any need to even take tylenol right now, that&#39;s how little pain I&#39;m in.

I just got off the phone with my gyno after my first clomid cycle and we're starting #2 now at 50mg since I already ovulate so...of course I ovulated at 50mg...and she has recommended that I get a AMH test.  I'm not sure that my insurance will cover it since they cover nothing that is labeled at infertility. Did anyone have to pay out of pocket for this test? How much was it? My OBGYN just said it ""could be pricey"" which I don't know if that means ...$100 or $2,000 in her eyes. It's the one blood test I haven't had done, I have had my prolactin, FSH, TSH, and progesterone all done and they were all normal.

Also do SA's generally always test for morphology and motility? Or do they just test for volume?

I&#39;m not sure that my insurance will cover it since they cover nothing that is labeled at infertility. Did anyone have to pay out of pocket for this test? How much was it? My OBGYN just said it &quot;could be pricey&quot; which I don&#39;t know if that means ...$100 or $2,000 in her eyes.

123,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"To be fair when I say my SIL is lapping me: I'm not counting most of the time she was pregnant as time I was TTC because I was having some health issues where I couldn't TTC and ended up needing to go back on birth control for a bit. For example I found out I had a cancerous tumor in my upper jawbone so I had to deal with all that. Then I had to get Endo back under control because I was in crippling pain and couldn't function on the bad days. Eventually I got my health sorted out enough to start back TTC and that is where I started the official count: January 2015. So to say she lapped me is partially not technically true. But considering the whole time I was desperately trying to get my health fixed enough to start back TTC it definitely fucking feels true.

Anyhow, she got pregnant her first cycle because of fucking course she did. And of course it was a totally picture perfect pregnancy without any complications. She didn't even have morning sickness! I mean how fucking lucky can you get, right? So she gave birth to a perfectly healthy baby girl. And so the whole time I'm TTC I'm being spammed with pregnancy updates, sonogram pictures, baby photos etc.

After her first baby she started ""not trying, not protecting."" I started back actively TTC the same time she started ""not trying, not protecting"" for #2. The whole time she was ""NTNP"" she kept whining to me about how incredibly hard ""secondary infertility"" is. Which, by the way, at the time it hadn't even been a year. And she  had no reason at all to believe she had secondary infertility except that she didn't get pregnant the first try again. So for the past 6 months or so I've had my family telling me that my situation is totally fine and not hard or depressing. But my poor, poor SIL and her secondary infertility. Oh now her situation is just truly heartbreaking and I should feel so sorry for her. Yes the person who has had 4 losses and 0 successful pregnancies should feel sorry for the person who got pregnant with a perfectly healthy baby on the first try just because she didn't get knocked up again immediately. Whatever family, whatever.

So my SIL texts me earlier today and starts making small talk. Oh fuck no. We never talk. We haven't texted since last year and barely ever then. So I immediately knew that she was about to announce a pregnancy. I suffered through all the meaningless small talk till she worked up the nerve to tell me that yep, she's pregnant again. She's due in January. It's a boy.

I texted her back congratulating her and telling her how happy I am for her. I said something about how I know she was really sad while she was struggling and it's great that it finally happened for her. She sent me back something saying that she's praying for my husband and I that we get a baby soon. Then tells me a story about how her friend had a MC and she was sad for her friend but her friend got offered a position a couple of days after the MC in Spain so ""clearly it just wasn't the right time."" Because everyone knows you can't go to Spain and work there while pregnant, right? (yes, that's sarcasm. Fuck all that noise.) I put my phone down, turned to my husband and said ""<SIL> is an incredibly shitty fucking friend. At least I don't have any shitty friends like that to make this whole thing harder. So at least we have that going for us?""

Don't get me wrong I'm happy for my SIL. I just don't know how to be happy for her without also being really, really sad for myself and my husband. ETA: And okay fine if we're being really honest I'm struggling to be happy for her. Her and my brother moved in with my elderly grandmother and bragged to the family about how they were going to ""con"" my grandmother out of her money and have her change her will to give them everything (all the family land and such). They're also expecting my grandmother to not only let them live there rent free but to also do the cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. So they turned my elderly grandmother into their maid. And on top of all that they complained nonstop to anyone who would listen the past 2 years about how incredibly hard it is to have a baby/child. My SIL has even complained to me at length, after my MCs, about how her life is *so hard* because her daughter won't go to sleep at night without being cuddled for 15 minutes. My SIL is a SAHM and being ""forced"" to cuddle her completely adorable little girl every night for 15 whole minutes is too much? She is honestly going to complain to someone who at the time had just been through a 3rd loss about how fucking hard it is to cuddle an adorable 2 year old? I mean, if cuddling your child is too fucking hard maybe you shouldn't have another child. Just saying. 

Bright sides: now I don't have to listen to my mother whine all the time to me about how she'll ""never have another grandchild."" Fuck you mom for assuming my womb is completely dusty and barren and I'll literally *never* get my take-home baby. And I also don't have to have my struggle constantly minimized with a ""oh your situation isn't so bad! At least you're getting pregnant! Look at your poor SIL. She has secondary infertility. You should feel sorry for her because her situation is really hard."" 

I also wanted to say that I appreciate how warm and welcoming everyone here has been of me. I always feel like an impostor here because ""at least I can get pregnant."" I know my reason here isn't one of the standard reasons. And I know I don't really understand IF the way some of you ladies do. I haven't been through what you all have been through. You're all so strong and it's inspiring.

127,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,
So I posted recently that we are switching clinics since my last one was not pushing testing and I really want it after my MC. Apparently the new place has a much better lab.


New clinic said they often do day 3 PGS with a fresh transfer on day 5. They have a lot of international clients, so my guess is this is to avoid waiting a month for FET. However, he said I could do day 5 PGS + freeze all if I wanted.


So I'm torn between these two options:

**Option #1:**

August cycle  - Do day 5 PGS and freeze all. No transfer 

Sept cycle - If we managed to freeze a good number in Aug, then do FET only. If numbers were poor, do another retrieval with day 5 PGS, freeze all september embryos, and transfer from August.

Pros: day 5 pgs seems to be more accurate and less damaging to embryos. 

Cons: embryos might not survive the thaw. Might end up with nothing from August.

**Option #2:**

Aug cycle - do PGS on day 3 and do a fresh day 5 transfer. Freeze remainders.

Sept cycle - if August did not work, either do a FET if there are any or do a new cycle.

Pros: Fresh transfer worked for me once. Never had anything make it to freeze before, but was that because the lab wasn't as good?

Cons: Day-3 PGS is harder on embryos and not as accurate as day 5.


Previous cycles had 13 fertilize with 3 transferred on day 3, and then 10 fertilize with 3 transferred on day 5. Neither ever had anything make it to freeze which is what is stressing me out. 

I would like to have some embryos banked if possible because I'm turning 37 in September, so if that cycle works, I'll be 39/40 before trying again. 

What would you do?

<p>Cons: embryos might not survive the thaw. Might end up with nothing from August.</p>

<p><strong>Option #2:</strong></p>

<p>Aug cycle - do PGS on day 3 and do a fresh day 5 transfer. Freeze remainders.</p>

<p>Sept cycle - if August did not work, either do a FET if there are any or do a new cycle.</p>

<p>Pros: Fresh transfer worked for me once. Never had anything make it to freeze before, but was that because the lab wasn&#39;t as good?</p>

<p>Cons: Day-3 PGS is harder on embryos and not as accurate as day 5.</p>

<p>Previous cycles had 13 fertilize with 3 transferred on day 3, and then 10 fertilize with 3 transferred on day 5. Neither ever had anything make it to freeze which is what is stressing me out. </p>

<p>I would like to have some embryos banked if possible because I&#39;m turning 37 in September, so if that cycle works, I&#39;ll be 39/40 before trying again. </p>

<p>What would you do?</p>

So frustrated/angry I feel like I can't breathe. Thought i was out of this issue when we conceived with iui.  We have had 1 previous Mc and I had one prior to being with my husband.  On 7 weeks 1 day super strong heartbeat and everything looked great. 2 days later our baby was gone. This was a huge blow as 10 days prior we had to put down our fur baby of 16 years, and we spent our wedding anniversary in emerge. Posted this last week and got so much support  (thank you BTW! You guys are amazing). We found out on a Monday and I was able to get in for a d&c Thursday.  I opted for this as I didn't want to go through a prolonged natural miscarriage at home (previous one was 4 days of Labour pains). Day of surgery was very rushed. Was in the OR 45 mins after getting to the hospital and was home within 4 hours. My surgeon never spoke to me after, I was told there's limited pain  (hahaha, 10ml of morphine later) , and was quickly rushed out of hospital. No big deal I'm thinking. I've done this before. Get home and my post-op sheet (which was folded) is not mine, but complete with some other poor woman's history and surgery details. Called the hospital and let them know about the breach in confidentiality.  They're response was ""oops sorry. Yours is here. Can you bring it back?"" For sure! I've been given a crap ton of narcotics and anesthetic.  Let me hop in my car to FIX YOUR FUCK UP! I shredded the document and rested for a few days. Moving on? Hell no! Sunday night I start full blown hemorrhaging complete with clots. Monday am back in emerge for this . They do blood work, give me pain meds, and booked for an ultrasound today. Woke up feeling great and thought ""it's okay now cause I'm feeling good "". Nope! Turns out they missed most of the products in my d&c, worried about infection, and hcg is measuring over 8000 and climbing. Was told not to worry and that I should let my body do what comes ""naturally"". FUCK YOUR HAT!!!! There's is nothing about this process that is natural. My body wouldn't expel my baby, which is why I needed surgery in the first place. It's not natural to keep miscarrying and that my body is working against nature. So I'm here, back at home, on bed rest,  no dog, no baby, and the icing on the cake is an laid off husband who Is super worried and I don't know how to help him.

This was a huge blow as 10 days prior we had to put down our fur baby of 16 years, and we spent our wedding anniversary in emerge. Posted this last week and got so much support  (thank you BTW! You guys are amazing). We found out on a Monday and I was able to get in for a d&amp;c Thursday.  I opted for this as I didn&#39;t want to go through a prolonged natural miscarriage at home (previous one was 4 days of Labour pains). Day of surgery was very rushed. Was in the OR 45 mins after getting to the hospital and was home within 4 hours. My surgeon never spoke to me after, I was told there&#39;s limited pain  (hahaha, 10ml of morphine later) , and was quickly rushed out of hospital. No big deal I&#39;m thinking. I&#39;ve done this before. Get home and my post-op sheet (which was folded) is not mine, but complete with some other poor woman&#39;s history and surgery details. Called the hospital and let them know about the breach in confidentiality.  They&#39;re response was &quot;oops sorry. Yours is here. Can you bring it back?&quot; For sure! I&#39;ve been given a crap ton of narcotics and anesthetic.  Let me hop in my car to FIX YOUR FUCK UP! I shredded the document and rested for a few days. Moving on? Hell no! Sunday night I start full blown hemorrhaging complete with clots. Monday am back in emerge for this . They do blood work, give me pain meds, and booked for an ultrasound today. Woke up feeling great and thought &quot;it&#39;s okay now cause I&#39;m feeling good &quot;. Nope! Turns out they missed most of the products in my d&amp;c, worried about infection, and hcg is measuring over 8000 and climbing. Was told not to worry and that I should let my body do what comes &quot;naturally&quot;. FUCK YOUR HAT!!!! There&#39;s is nothing about this process that is natural. My body wouldn&#39;t expel my baby, which is why I needed surgery in the first place. It&#39;s not natural to keep miscarrying and that my body is working against nature. So I&#39;m here, back at home, on bed rest,  no dog, no baby, and the icing on the cake is an laid off husband who Is super worried and I don&#39;t know how to help him. Sorry again for the obnoxiously long post but if I didn&#39;t get it out I was going to explode</p>

I always knew I would have trouble getting pregnant, but I was really hopeful that somehow things would just...fall into place for me. PCOS runs in my family- every single woman on my maternal side has some hormonal problem, cysts on the ovaries, crazy menstrual cycle, etc. None of them have had problems getting pregnant, even if it took them some time. My own mother is missing 1/2 and 1/3 of her ovaries and managed to have 2 children without assistance. 

Then there's me; no ovulations in at least the last year(testing), crazy inconsistent cycle that can leave me either bleeding for weeks at a time or without a period for months. Spouse and I haven't used any sort of protection in over 2 years, and just figured we had gotten really lucky/good at figuring out my rhythm. Once I started testing for ovulations, I realized I just...wasn't. After 8 months of trying REALLY hard, I finally had us see an RE. I always figured that I would have to have help getting pregnant, so I was prepared and excited to get started.

And then they did the SA. Turns out spouse currently only had 3% normal sperm, go figure. Counts are good, motility is meh but ok...but the morphology is all fucked. We're waiting on chromosomal testing and an appointment with the urologist, but like...what the hell? I spent a solid two days in bed crying about it like a little baby, because it caught me off guard so badly (also I was in the middle of my provera cycle preparing for my upcoming HSG...that stuff really messes with you.)

Suddenly, our plan went from chlomid and possible IUI to IVF. I'm absolutely stunned.

Now it looks like that may be our ONLY option, and I'm finding myself completely overwhelmed by the idea.

Compounding everything, is that my insurance coverage for IF treatments isn't as good as I thought it was due to some bullshit technicality. We've been saving to buy a house, but it looks like a solid chunk of that money is now earmarked for IVF. I'm just glad we have it at all.

I addition, I work on L/D as an RN and just started midwifery school. Somehow, this all just feels like such a kick in the teeth. We're neck deep in our busy season and we've had so many teen mothers and spontaneous multiples pregnancies over the last few weeks which coincided with my finding out about all of this...and I just want to SCREAM. Those fucking cows can get pregnant by just looking at a dick and then they continue to do all of the drugs they feel like, ignore treatment for VD and generally fail to take care of themselves...and they are rewarded with the most beautiful and healthy children.

For those of you who have taken these vaginally,  what was sex like? Just curious as to what we can expect. Is it messy? 

How much progesterone discharge did you experience? Was it enough to fill a regular pad? My capsules are a reddish, maroon color.

I've been an active member of this sub for over two years and have mentioned God and my faith in other comments and posts. Anyone who knows me knows that I have never pushed my faith on people here, nor would I ever. I'm also extremely sensitive to the role faith has played in IF and have really been struggling myself.

I talked to my primary care doctor and she referred me to endocrinology for hypothyroid.  Later, when the IVF nurse called with my fertilization report (3/7 fertilized normally, which is WAY better than I was even expecting), I let her know about what was going on.  She suggested that I contact my RE and let him know.  So I did.  He said that my levels were definitely elevated and immediately put me on 50 MCG of Synthroid, and that we will continue to monitor my TSH levels. 

Yesterday, I met with the endocrinologist, and she confirmed my diagnosis, agreed with my RE on dosage and monitoring TSH with blood work every 4-6 weeks.  She said that for pregnancy, they want TSH levels less than 2.5, and internet research has pointed to a connection between hypothyroid and miscarriage (scary!).  She also mentioned that she has noticed a lot of women coming in after fertility treatments with new or worsening thyroid issues. 

I was probably predisposed to have some sort of thyroid issue.  My mom was hyper for years before getting her thyroid killed and my aunt (mom's sister) is hypo.  I think the IVF meds might have just helped it along.

I started Synthroid on Saturday, and we did transfer as normal on Sunday (2/3 eggs were graded high enough to transfer, the other one probably won't make it to freeze).  Sitting here in the TWW, hoping for the best. 

But the moral to my story: if you have family history of thyroid issues, you might want to see about getting your TSH levels checked after you're done with stims - at first I was hella stressed out about it, but I'm honestly glad that the lab messed up and just now ran that test (if you didn't read my OG post, the TSH test was ordered over a year ago by my primary care doctor as part of a physical and the lab never ran it when I first went in).

&nbsp;

I have posted here a few times, and I feel pretty bad because I am not as active as I should be and then request advice of all you kind hearted peoples.

 &nbsp;

We had 3 miscarriages last year.  1 was within a week of finding out so maybe you would consider it chem.  1 was at 6 weeks and seemed to be a blighted ovum as it never developed a fetal pole.  The other one was at 10 weeks and found the heart stopped at 9 and I had to do a D&C.  At D&C I chose to get genetic testing done, but it ended up contaminated.

&nbsp;

Fast forward to RE.  Ran tons of blood tests - no issues other than low vit D which I am now taking.  Had an ultrasound and HSG, which was perfectly fine.  I do have a slightly low (AMH? of 8 ) even though my FSH is 10 which they want it to be 10 or more.   Not sure I am getting all the details right, I just know I produce slightly less eggs than I should.

 I also have a bit of a luteal phase defect where my luteal phase is about 10-11 days.
 
 &nbsp;

Since the cause of my recurrent losses are unknown.  The recommendation is to either
 
1. Keep trying and start aspirin and progesterone as soon as I ovulate. 
 
2. Go for IVF with PGS.
 
 &nbsp;

Since I had my D&C last november, my cycles never went back to normal - which concerns me but the Dr. basically says it will take some time.  I had 1 period in Dec, 1 in Jan - none after that so was put on progesterone in late march to try and ""reset"" things - then didn't get another one until late may which was super long, one in Jun which was super long and now I havent detected ovulation 20 days into this cycle :(
  
&nbsp;
 
At this point I dont know what to do.  IVF is expensive, obviously and I have at least a 5k co-pay but I dont know how much insurance will cover until I can speak with their fin counselor next week.

 
I am also terrified of trying again naturally and having it not work out, and then even more messed up cycles...

 
&nbsp;

Any thoughts from you guys?

[Let me say upfront that I already know—and knew immediately — that my insurance's actions were correct and logical. That doesn't make me hate them any less. They were just covering their own asses, as we all do.]

I did three rounds of Letrozole + Ovidrel + Vagifem (best script name I've ever filled) to no avail. We're stuck for now because doc doesn't think IUI will have any effect and since my insurance doesn't cover it, it'd be $1K a pop out of pocket for an emotional roller coaster that ends in a big pile of babyless shit. Her suggestion is to save the money and go straight to IVF, which I agree with. But we're nowhere near able to afford IVF right now. So we wait. It's been 2 months, and I'm surviving the limbo as best I can. 

I went to pick up my Adderall today and, per my insurance, the pharmacist had to ask me if I'm pregnant, could be pregnant, or am breastfeeding before handing over my speed. 

I get it that I'm probably flagged as a risky patient somewhere due to the combination of amphetamines and fertility dope. But for fucks sake, the reason I'm two months behind filling it is because I didn't take any during the danger zone when we were trying, and I had no intention of continuing if I conceived. I'm a responsible human being and I'm well aware that I take enough to help a horse focus, and no, I'm not going to share it with a fetus. Nobody batted an eye when I filled them all in quick succession, but since I've stopped filling scripts for fertility meds I could be pregnant. Got it. Never mind that I've not made any claims for an ultrasound nor an OB visit. Did take expensive fertility meds and stopped, so better check. 

Like I said, I get it. Intellectually I understand how the algorithm alerted the pharmacy to me. I also understand why both medical professionals and laypersons alike ask me if I'm pregnant if I hint at nausea; hoofbeats mean horses, check. But understanding it doesn't mean that I don't want to punch you in the fucking throat for making me tell you that I'm not pregnant, that I'm sure I'm not pregnant, and again that yes I'm more fucking sure that I'm not pregnant than I am of just about anything in this universe.

164,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I just realized I haven't posted my updated story on here. During my IVF #5 with a new doctor, I ended up getting two awesome embryos and transferring them. Two is a huge deal for me since I've been diagnosed with DOR and only get one follicle, one egg and one embryo every other time. They just never stick. 

My first beta came back low, but confirmed a pregnancy. The nurses kept saying they weren't twin numbers, but still pregnant. Hey, I'll take what I can get so I was thrilled. My beta visits showed my HCG rising, but very slowly. I was still in the ""safe zone"" with my numbers. I remember having sharp pains on one side but I thought it was implantation pains. I mean, I've never been pregnant so I had no idea what was going on. I started feeling dizzy at work for a few days in a row, followed by nausea and not feeling like myself. Again, I thought this was pregnancy so I never said anything.  

When my numbers slowed down to almost a plateau, the doctors told me I was going to miscarriage. They couldn't find the gestational sac that they thought they saw days before and did a final scan to confirm that there was no pregnancy in the uterus and it was assumed to have broken up. Right as the doctor finished his exam, I asked if that was why I was experiencing so much pain on my right side. He put his gloves back on and went back in to find a heartbeat in my fallopian tube. My poor husband was thrilled to see a heartbeat and I felt horrible because I knew what that meant. 

We were sent to the ER where they confirmed the pregnancy one more time (which killed me to see the heartbeat again) and then sent me off to remove both the tube and the baby. I held it together for most of the visit, but I cried the whole way into the operating room. 

Recovery wasn't bad since it was laparoscopic (through my bellybutton). I originally had a trip booked to florida to see my mom, and exactly a week from surgery, I was fine to take the drive down there with my husband. I think I was more psychologically messed up than anything at this point, and I really needed my mom. It felt so much better finally telling her everything. 

On the drive home with two hours until home, my back really started hurting. I hurt my back earlier that month so I figured it was that. I wasn't about to go to a hospital in another state so I sucked it up and made it the rest of the way home. I had a doctors appointment first thing in the morning anyway. This is exactly two weeks from my ectopic surgery.

I go for blood work the following morning at my RE's office and the pain is magically gone. The nurse asks how I'm feeling and I tell her great. I go out for breakfast with my sister and get an urgent call from my RE saying that my HCG isn't going down like it should... it's going UP. 

I go back to the doctor for an emergency scan. Another freaking heartbeat. A second baby. The baby was still on my right side but in the corner of my uterus where the fallopian tube entrance would be. I'm rushed back to the hospital where I see the same exact doctors and nurses as 2 weeks earlier. 

I couldn't even tell you how I was feeling since everything happened so fast, but I couldn't stop thinking about how bad I must have been hurting that second baby with all the painkillers and drugs they gave me to take for my first surgery. I hurt my own baby and I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself for that. 

The doctors decided to remove a giant fibroid from my uterus since they think it might have pushed both babies over to the right. Instead of a laparoscopic surgery, I had to have a surgery similar to a c section. My uterus was cut open and I would need to stay overnight in the hospital. They took pictures of me during surgery (pictures are in another post on here somewhere but I'll try to link it) and I was visited by almost every single OBGYN staff at the hospital. They asked permission to bring residents into the room because I was a rare case, so I was constantly having crowds of doctors in my room. Apparently, the changes of having an ectopic is 1% and I just had this happen twice in two weeks with twins. 

As far as the pain after surgery, it was the worst thing I've ever felt in my life. I literally passed out from the pain while I was trying to get out of bed in the hospital. It made the laparoscopy feel like a walk in the park. Coughing hurt, sitting up hurt, trying to pee hurt. It was miserable. I was told this feels worse than a c section because of the amount of cutting they do into the uterus. My recovery time was 6-8 weeks and consisted of mostly bedrest. I would never wish that kind of hell on anyone. 

Because of the amount of trauma on my uterus, I was told to wait 6 months before I'm allowed to transfer again. I'm still waiting for my 6 months to be up and it's killing me. I was so close, you know? I worked so freaking hard for those babies. Five rounds of IVF. Five. And I know this sounds dramatic, but it took me a really long time to stop blaming myself for ending those babies' lives. They were completely healthy embryos with strong heartbeats and I had them literally torn from my body just because they were in the wrong spot. They didn't miscarry, they were ripped from me voluntarily. I still can't wrap my head around that. 

I guess I just wanted to put my story out there because it's a little bit different than the rest. And I want people to know how important it is to speak up when something isn't feeling right, because I was really close to bleeding out if I didn't tell them to go back in and see what was hurting me. I'm currently allowed to stim and freeze embryos, so that's what I'm doing right now. Hopefully I'll have some frozen embryos to transfer when my uterus is ready. I'm really open about this, so feel free to ask me whatever you want. Thanks for reading!

<p>So my gyno put me on clomid first, she said we could try femera next if we wanted, I&#39;m only on 50mg. This was my first cycle on clomid, that cycle just ended, I&#39;m on CD3 now and waiting for her to send in my script for either 50mg or 100mg of clomid, I take it CD5-9.

199,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone!
I'll start with some back story. We've been trying for nearly six years.  We started with a fertility clinic that was local to us where they didn't do any fertility testing at all (not even Normal hormone testing, no HSG, absolutely nothing) prior to putting me on 9 rounds of clomid and 3 rounds of femara over about a year and a half.  I didn't know enough at the time to push for more testing or know the damage that so many medicated cycles in such a short time would do. I ended up gaining nearly 80 lbs on clomid. After those 12 total rounds they referred us to an RE that was a little bit farther away from our home; he recommended we take a break from trying so I could lose the weight I had gained before we tried anything else.  Flash forward to last month- I have lost 100 lbs over the last year and a half. Also, found a new doctor that is highly recommended in our area.

Went in for my first appointment in June where he ran a battery of tests, all which came back within normal ranges. At that first appointment I had gotten more information from him than with the last 3 doctors over a five year period.  Prior to this we were diagnosed with ""unexplained infertility"" and ""male factor fertility"". He diagnosed me with PCOS on the spot from an ultrasound that had been in my records from one of the prior doctors, who had never even mentioned PCOS. He also diagnosed me with endometriosis.

Well Wednesday I went in for an internal and a HSG, yesterday I went in for a lap to have the endo removed. He had said there was a lot of endo right at the opening of my cervix and pretty severe endo throughout. He removed as much as he could. He also removed a staple from my appendectomy 11 years ago and some scar tissue from the same surgery. He then unblocked my right Fallopian tube and popped a bunch of the cysts on my ovaries.

These are my diagnoses just from within the last month-
-anteverted uterus
- endometriosis
-PCOS
-blocked right tube (unblocked during lap)

((Seriously if you've read all of this, I appreciate it so much.))

I'm feeling so duped and discouraged with all of the stuff that the other doctors missed.  I've been dealing with this shit for over 5 1/2 years and all of this could have been tested for and diagnosed in the beginning, instead of making me feel that it's some unexplained thing. This surgery could have been done 5 years ago to at least give us better chances.

My husband is going to go back in for a new semen analysis as well to see where his fertility sits.  He has also lost quite a bit of weight with me so we're hoping that may help on his side as well. 

What are likely to be our steps moving forward? I don't have a post op with him until late August, so I'm hoping to get some ideas on what we will do moving forward.  Will we be able to try IUI or will it be straight to IVF? How quickly will the endo return? Does an anteverted uterus affect fertility or pregnancy? How quickly can we start trying after the lap?

Thank you all so much for reading this and listening to me rant. I'm just feeling so lost and have lost quite a bit of faith in fertility doctors at this point.  My new doctor seems amazing though and I can't help but have a newfound hope on this ridiculously drawn out journey.

My husband and I have been TTC for a little over a year with no luck. On various forms of BC for 16 years, so I really have no idea what my cycle should have been since the meds made my ""period"" arrive like clockwork.  The first six months without, my period was super and regular, and then just stopped in January.

Finally got in a visit with an RE and found out my AMH is super low and that combined with some other things earned me a diagnosis of perimenopause.  The doctor recommended IVF with a donor egg initially, but agreed to let us try medically induced ovulation first.  Also had an HSG which came back completely clear. Had some pink spotting and very light clotting that started a week afterward, but nothing else.  The doctor said we could count that as a period.  Not sure I understand why.

I never wanted to do IVF because of how expensive it is, but we are actually in a position where it's not an unreasonable doing on our bank account. We have been saving up for a house, but things changed and this is currently ranked higher on the scale of importance.

I hate that we have no way of knowing what kind of success rate we are looking at.  The doctor says there's no reason to believe it won't work, but I just have a gut feeling that it won't.

They prescribed 0.05mg of Synthroid and it was life changing, short lived, but life changing.

They told us following testing that there were no chromosomal abnormalities, all was normal on that front. We haven't gone for a follow up appointment.

On CD 24 I started spotting, it was rusty red color then for the next 5-6 days its been dark brown to light brown but so light that it can't be my period. I tested on CD 24, negative, assumed I was out what with the spotting and expected my period to show, but nothing came. Tested yesterday and this morning, still negative. My cycles are normally 25 days ish, but my last cycle on clomid at 50mg my period showed up day 22 with day 21 bright red blood spotting that I thought was my period. What the Fuck is going on? This is process is enough of a mind game as it is without this shit going on. 

If I'm out, which I assume I am, why hasn't my body followed it's normal course? I've had some minor symptoms, but all can be attributed to PMS. Should I do some blood work or just keep waiting? Or Do you think I'm on my next cycle already and I missed it.

Been lurking for a while now, but ready to join the club.  I have been under the care of an amazing RE here in Richmond, Virginia for a few years now.  On a strict Ketogenic diet (reddit-inspired) for almost 4 years now; my hormones have regulated, my testosterone has dropped to normal levels, I am at a healthy weight, and have avoided medications to combat my glucose-intolerence.  As of today, my husband and I are beginning the long and emotional journey of IVF.  Today we found out that we have viable sperm.  Next up is my saline ultrasound and mock embryo transfer.

I feel like our awareness of how NOT easy this process is going to be is helping us prepare mentally.  Both my husband and I have accepted our infertility issues and would love nothing more than to create a human being together, and if we can't, our next venture will be adoption.  Hello r/infertility, I am proud to be a part of this community of strong and wonderful people who are tackling challenges head-on, staying positive, and making sure nobody feels alone in this journey.  

Feel free to share any advice or ask any questions! I look forward to being more active in this subreddit as I know it will keep me sane!

Also really fuckin' old spoilers ahead. That if you don't know you probably would want to know anyway.

I've been binge watching old shows on Netflix. It first started when I watched Scrubs last year - I get into the show, invested in the characters, and then in season Turk and Carla look at each other and decide to have a baby. I immediately googled it to save myself heartache and see that while they do have minor struggle, they get pregnant in less than a year and have a baby. And not only that, Google notified me that apparently JD gets his girlfriend pregnant accidentally. So by season 5 and beyond, it's basically unwatchable for me.

I watched Frasier from beginning to end, and as much as I adored Niles and Daphne, did they even have to bother with a stupid episode where they think for a hot second that Niles is infertile then Daphne accidentally takes a pregnancy test instead of an ovulation test and is super magically pregnant after 2 weeks of trying!?

I'm watching Parks and Rec for the first time right now, and I just made it through Leslie and Ben's wedding in season 5, and apparently I need to quit now. Not only does google inform me that Leslie gets pregnant with triplets at like age 40 (are you kidding me) but also apparently now Ann wants to have a baby and is interviewing sperm donors and Google also informs me she apparently has Chris' baby. So I guess I'll just have to be done with their wedding and wish them the best.

Gilmore Girls has Sookie accidentally getting pregnant repeatedly. I'm terrified to watch the new GG episodes when they air for fear that Lorelei or Rory get pregnant. Oh God or both. At the same time. I'll have to scope out summaries first.

The only show that was good about this was 30 Rock. She didn't just decide to have babies and magically get pregnant with triplets. I love Tina Fey more for that.

<p>I&#39;ve been binge watching old shows on Netflix. It first started when I watched Scrubs last year - I get into the show, invested in the characters, and then in season Turk and Carla look at each other and decide to have a baby. I immediately googled it to save myself heartache and see that while they do have minor struggle, they get pregnant in less than a year and have a baby. And not only that, Google notified me that apparently JD gets his girlfriend pregnant accidentally. So by season 5 and beyond, it&#39;s basically unwatchable for me.</p>

<p>I watched Frasier from beginning to end, and as much as I adored Niles and Daphne, did they even have to bother with a stupid episode where they think for a hot second that Niles is infertile then Daphne accidentally takes a pregnancy test instead of an ovulation test and is super magically pregnant after 2 weeks of trying!?</p>

<p>I&#39;m watching Parks and Rec for the first time right now, and I just made it through Leslie and Ben&#39;s wedding in season 5, and apparently I need to quit now.

248,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Just thought I'd share this in case anyone is in a similar situation. I've had this sort of gut feeling that maybe we should switch clinics for IVF #3. I am so glad we went for a second opinion today.

Quick background: did two IVFs due to MFI - first was a 3-day transfer, second was a 5-day transfer. Round 2 worked but had a MC at 12 weeks. Neither round had any embryos make it to freeze, even though we had good fertilization numbers (15 and 10). It was never explained to me why they did a 3-day during round 1, but my own RE had a medical emergency so another guy did it, and I could tell my RE wasn't too happy they did a 3-day.

Anyway, I recently got my first post-D&C period, so it's looking like August will be it for IVF #3. I asked my RE how he planned to proceed and he said another 5-day fresh transfer. While I really like my RE, that made some internal alarm bells ring because nothing about PGS was mentioned, considering I just had a miscarriage and am close to 37. We did do a loss panel - still waiting on our karyotype results for me and hubs, but the antibodies and others all came back ok. They did fetal tissue testing, but the cultures didn't work so we got no answers from that. But my repeated comments on testing have kind of been blown off, which made me suspicious that maybe they couldn't do it or didn't have a lot of success with it.

So, I did a ton of research online and found two new REs I wanted to talk to. One is local with an office in a high-end hospital, but I wasn't sure how it works if he's not part of a clinic in terms of the lab/etc. Another guy has a great reputation but he is in a clinic 3 hours away in Cancun. Well, turns out the first guy is actually partners with the second!  So I feel like that is a good omen. Crappy part is I'd have to go 3 hours away to do retrieval and transfer, but not the end of the world. The stimming/monitoring will all be done locally.

Things I liked about the new guy:

-He actually suggested supplements. Maca and stresstabs suggested for hubs sperm. He said even if it helps just a bit, it's worth doing. 

-He said he absolutely suggests PGS. Turns out my own clinic doesn't have in-house capabilities to do it. (nobody ever told me that outright). He knows my current RE and said he believes the protocol, etc, was good, but the lab isn't as modern and that limits the RE. Confirmed my suspicions there.

-Was skeptical of why they did a testicular biopsy on hubs when it showed he had a count of 600,000. He himself has done IVF with fresh samples with 200k counts. Hubs is going to do 2 weeks of HCG shots again and then another SA to see if we could do IVF 3 with a fresh sample. If not, we will look to get the frozen one at the current clinic transferred.

-Said he never does a 3-day transfer unless there were so few embryos that there was no choice (which was not the case for my IVF round 1). 

-Completely fluent in English. My Spanish is good but me and my current RE do this sort of Spanglish thing, and it's not ideal.

So, the decision is made! I'm going to follow my gut and we are switching to the new guy. 

He said they usually do pgs on day 3 and fresh transfer on day 5. But I could do PGS day 5 and then do FETs if I want. The clinic has a lot of medical tourism which would explain why many patients  might not want to have to come back for FETs.

<p>He says this was caused by a hysteroscopy performed by my OB/Gyn in 2012 to remove a polyp.  Of course he didn&#39;t mention the time he did the same procedure in 2013.  Shocking!</p>

<p>So my question is if any of you have sought out an Asherman&#39;s specialist or OB/Gyn surgeon?  Anyone recommend someone in the Southeast US?  I&#39;m starting to feel a little less than reassured in my RE&#39;s surgery skills.  I&#39;m a little more confident in his partner who will be assisting with the laproscopy portion, but she won&#39;t be the actual one cutting on my uterus.</p>

<p>It&#39;s complicated by the fact that my embryos are frozen at this RE&#39;s office.  I don&#39;t want to hurt any feelings if I go with another surgeon and then have to go back to them for my FETs.  There is one other clinic in town, but transporting embryos and having to restart with another RE isn&#39;t really something I want to do.</p>

I've been lurking here for a little over a month, so I figured I should introduce myself! I'm 25, and my husband is 26. I was diagnosed with PCOS about two months ago and took my first round of Femara last month with 2.5mg during days 3-7. Did a day 21 progesterone which came back 0.6 about two weeks ago.

Now on Day 33 and wondering what my next steps should be. My doctor upped my dose for next month to the middle dose, and told me at my appointment a week ago during my follow up appointment that I could ask for Provera to induce a period if it didn't start on its own within a week or two.

A couple of caveats, if they matter at all:

I usually have a period naturally, although it ranges anywhere from 30 days to 48 days. There have been a couple of times where I've actually seemed to ovulate in the past, with ovulation occurring later (range of CD22-26). My temps are all over the place as is typical of my annovulatory cycles, so it doesn't seem like I happened to ovulate later or would need to worry about that in any way.

Currently on day 33. Since my cycles average a bit longer, should I just keep waiting? What would you do?

I wish I could give you all a hug, and I wish all of you the best of luck. I hope you all get your babies you wish for, and wholeheartedly deserve.</p>

<p>No amount of thanks could be enough. Thank you so so much.</p>

We unmatched a couple weeks ago from a situation that was kind of scary. The donor mom's RE told me I should move the embryos because she meddles, and the emails from donor mom had so many red flags that indicated a very unhealthy attachment to the embryos. No legal contract was in place yet, and so we walked before we contacted the lawyer, because it was not good.


The very day we chose to unmatch, a different donor reached out to talk. She seemed to have a really healthy outlook on things. A few nights ago, she asked just two additional questions, and one of them was if we would baptize our kids. We're not religious and I'd previously made that clear that despite our upbringings, we didn't come from families of overwhelming faith and decided not to practice religion, so I responded honestly that we would not.

Last Thursday, a potential donor in another group friended me. I accepted because I figured if that was the transparency someone wanted, I'd oblige them.

I received an incredibly rude message back that she agreed, especially after stalking my Facebook page. My Facebook page is literally 90% dogs and 10% election content with a Democratic viewpoint.

My period never started after going off of birth control and we needed to check to see if I just didn't have enough lining to shed it, or if I was still gearing up for my period.  Also to see if I had any cysts before starting the the menopur.

Doc looks at the screen while he's moving that wand around and tells me ""I'm pretty sure you're pregnant.  Have to do a blood test to be sure."".  Then he shows me what he's looking at, a circle with a dot in the middle.  Told us we'd hear back around noon about the blood test.

That was a LONG fucking wait, my husband and I both giddy.  Trying not to get excited, but my calendar showed that I had stopped the birth control a couple days before I would have ovulated had I been on femara, and the doc said that bc occasionally causes ovulation in women with ovulatory problems.  We spent the day thinking that we got our miracle baby.  That all my body needed  was fucking birth control to get knocked up.

Got the call, negative test.  I have a cyst on my ovary so not only a negative test but we have to postpone the treatment and go back on birth control, which seems to kill my libido.  Ok.  I can deal with that.  It sucks, but I can deal.  It's been 8 years of negative tests.  One more doesn't knock me for THAT much of a loop anymore.

On top of normal questions (how often do you use facebook, did you like our page, how old are you...), they had a few questions about what you'd like to see on the page.  A few of them were about success stories and pictures of newborns.  I was a little annoyed...I basically stopped using social media because I was sick of other people's pregnancy announcements and baby pictures, and then I read ""Would you be willing to post pictures of your newborn on our Facebook page?""

As of right now, I'm on my first round of femara/letrozole, after my first round of provera. I'm on day 4, and I see no signs of this hellish period letting up anytime soon. I'm going through 3-4 pads plus numerous tampons a day, like probably 10. So, my question... how long does a period usually last after taking provera?
