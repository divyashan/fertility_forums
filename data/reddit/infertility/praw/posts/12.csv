Wife's AMH was measured at .5 twice, but recently was measured at 1.0. FSH levels hover in the mid-low teens. We did many medicated cycles with Femara along w IUI/timed, but no dice. Now we are starting our first IVF!

So I just wanted to share and get peoples thoughts/experiences. We decided to go out to CCRM bc their numbers are much better for our age/diagnosis than our local clinics, we also weren't too happy with our local options from previous treatment. Yes, it is more expensive and travel is a bitch but it's all about results. We're going big!

We are on the antagonist (I believe also called the short) cycle, doing Menopur in the AM and Gonal F in the PM. I believe we start Cetrotide on the third. Wife got a baseline ultrasound on Saturday and we started stims yesterday. On Friday we travel to Denver and she will stay for a week before approximate retrieval date of 10/9. I come home on Sunday then travel back out on Wednesday and stay through the retrieval, etc... They will use ICSI for insemination and genetic testing on any embryos due to our diagnosis. Wife has also been on DHEA and COQ10, that recent AMH measurement was after about 3 months of DHEA (not sure if there is a correlation or not). We are both also on a whole host of supplements at doctors orders. 

So, yeah. We are super excited, but also trying to stay level headed about it. It feels a little like it did when we first started trying (We could be pregnant soon!). We are just trying to stay in the right mind state, and visualize little follicles growing everyday.

My question: I voiced my concerns, and the RE (per the nurse) agreed this was problematic but ""now we can have a plan for next time"".

(to be clear, I wouldn&#39;t be taking Ovidrel at any other point in the cycle - just half a dose 7dpo) Bonus question: if I do push for progesterone supplements (which is what I&#39;m leaning towards)...what kind should I ask for? Thank you in advance for your wisdom and guidance!</p>

And one thing that was frustrating about IF was how murky the details were about what to do, what to expect, medications, etc.  One RE would say one thing, another would say something slightly different...and objective facts were often hard to come by.

Last night, I was glancing through the New England Journal of Medicine (I'm a cardiologist), and I saw this new trial (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414827?query=featured_home).  Summary - it's a NIH-sponsored trial for unexplained IF of letrozole vs clomid vs menopur with IUI, about 300 couples per arm.  In this trial, roughly speaking, menopur was more effective than clomid which was slighlty more effective than letrozole (but this last comparison is not statistically signficant) at the cost of higher twin rates.  Pregnancy rates, live birth rates, twin rates, etc are all included.

This is important to mitigate frustration and wasting money, to have a better idea of your chances and options as you go through blood draws and u/s and IUI all that shit, and to be able to speak with your RE in an informed manner.

I have an appointment with my OBGYN on Monday to discuss next steps but I just have this hankering feeling IVF is in our near future. 

Background: We started trying a year ago, conceived on the first try (we thought we were the lucky ones), but had a missed miscarriage at 5 weeks. I had a D&C, but two cycles later we conceived again. In March we found out that was ectopic at 7 weeks and had emergency surgery to remove the tube. Now it has been 6 months and nothing to show for it. I understand that is no time at all compared to some of the people here, but given the circumstances I feel like the issues are with the only Fallopian tube I have left which would leave IVF as our only option.

I hope you are all well. 
We had our WFT appointment today. It was suppose to be on October 1st, but the clinic called on tuesday to offer an appointment this thursday. (And the way they get offended when you don't jump on appointment and you need to check with your work.... Sigh).
So...... The doc had little to say. I thought the OHSS could be the cause of our massive failure (18 matures eggs, after ISCI 5 fertilized, only 2 made it to blasto at day 6, but they not good enough). But he said they normally wants around 12 eggs, so was not to high with 18. But they harvest 26, and had over 50 follicules.... Anyhow, he says the swimmers they found did not have great mobility, so that's more likely the cause of so little fertilization. And the poor embryo development, probably a result of the translocation.

We have a new protocol. Just need to go to the hospital tomorrow to do sample for the pre-conceptual bilan, then we will be on the waiting list, and we know when we gonna have the cycle (hard to coordinate for the micro-tese and the PGS). My next day 1 should be next thursday, so nothing will happen in octobre.

So... our odd are poor. Very poor. But, if miraculously, all the swimmers in next cycle have the good chomozones, and not a mixed of the a good one with a fucked-up, we might be ok.

While I am between IVF cycles I thought I would share my egg retrieval story with you all. When I was preparing for #1 it was the thing I was the most scared about; more so than the injections anyway. I think it was because I didn't know anything about it. I hope that by giving my account it could help someone else feel slightly more prepared for it.
First of all I wasn't allowed to eat from midnight the night before, This was very difficult for me because I was hungry ALL the time. But somehow I got through it! You are also banned from drinking 2 hours before the procedure. One of the strangest rules was the ban on any perfumed products - nothing to be used in your morning shower and no deodorant/perfume etc. This also goes for your SO if they are coming in with you. Lastly you are asked to take some over-the-counter pain killers (paracetamol/ibuprofen) before you turn up. The morning of the ER my SO and I arrived at the Clinic and were shown into our very own cubicle where I changed into a hospital gown and hair-net/shower cap type thing. All other clothing had to come off except my bra which was actually disappointing because my breasts were so sore I would have rather gone without it. My SO was coming into the procedure with me so he got to change into scrubs, a hairnet and clogs. We made a very attractive couple. In the hour before the procedure I had a cannula put in to my arm. I have tiny veins which like to hide so am used to problems in this area but they managed to get it in really quickly and it was not too painful at all. Into this they injected an antibiotic which smelled like a cleaning product. I also had to swallow a sedative pill. Eventually it was time to make our way through into the procedure room. I lay on the bed and managed to get my feet into the absurdly high stirrups and the nurses tried their best to preserve my dignity although I gave up caring about that a long time ago. Although the sedative was calming I was still very aware of what was going on and could move and talk with no problem. I just felt a bit sleepy. I am not sure if it is different in other countries, but in Scotland, the procedure is done with an internal vaginal ultrasound with a needle attached to it. The nurse had warned me not to look at the needle. She said it was huge but they  only put the very tip in (hehehe). So I made sure to focus somewhere else. Just before the procedure I was given a lovely painkiller (not quite as strong as morphine) which was very pleasant and made everything a bit woozy. My SO was by my head and holding my hand and it was very comforting to have him there. The actual procedure was uncomfortable and at certain points it did hurt but nowhere near as much as I thought it would. It wasn't too bad at all. During the procedure the vials containing the follicle contents are passed through a hatch to the waiting embryologist who studies them straight away. So while you are lying on the table being poked by a needle, you can hear them reporting how many eggs you have so far. This helps to take your mind off things. The whole procedure is fairly quick and I was told that typically it lasts 15-20 minutes. 

This next bit is a little bit gruesome.You have been warned! Unfortunately I had a complication. The needle punctured a blood vessel. I was aware of a lot of liquid pouring out of me and concern over my (already quite low) blood pressure dropping. The Dr was preoccupied with getting me to stop moving (since the needle was still inside me) and I remember him and the nurses commenting that I had a bleed. I also remember asking him if what was coming out of me was blood. I think that is the first time he looked down (rather than at the ultrasound screen) and realised properly what was going on. The staff were excellent. Because of the instant drop in BP I got very sweaty, dizzy and nauseated. This was a bit scary for me and I naturally worried that worse was to come. Luckily the bleed stopped of it's own accord and the follicles had all been emptied. As soon as my BP stabilised I began to feel a bit better and they wheeled me back to my recovery cubicle. It's an unexpected side effect and one which really doesn't often happen. But really, it was all over very quickly and it had no effect on the next step in the IVF process. 
I spent a few more hours recovering with a drip in and trying to get my blood pressure up. Eventually I was released and sent home (woohoo). I took over the counter pain relief for the next few days and apart from wincing a little when I sat down and a general ache in my ovaries, the recovery was fine. The bloating remained and if anything it got a little worse. I drank loads of lucozade forgetting that it contains caffeine and so didn't sleep for the first 2 nights! But it helped me to feel a lot better. 
I suppose that my story might scare people but what I am trying to say is that I didn't have a straightforward ER but I am still ready to go through it again in a few months. Plus the first bit was straightforward and I can honestly say that it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I feared it would be.

So I will end on this note; while I was recovering, my SO commented on how pale I was and asked if I wanted him to 'colour me in' in any particular colour. I vaguely remember trying really hard to decide between purple and blue but I must have settled on both because apparently I told him that I wanted to be 'poo' coloured. I can't see him letting me forget that anytime soon!",[],False,,0,False,My Egg Retrieval Story,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_3m9buw,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,False,1,,self,False,,{},,True,,1443162991.0,text,0,,,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello All

One of the strangest rules was the ban on any perfumed products - nothing to be used in your morning shower and no deodorant/perfume etc. This also goes for your SO if they are coming in with you. Lastly you are asked to take some over-the-counter pain killers (paracetamol/ibuprofen) before you turn up. The morning of the ER my SO and I arrived at the Clinic and were shown into our very own cubicle where I changed into a hospital gown and hair-net/shower cap type thing. All other clothing had to come off except my bra which was actually disappointing because my breasts were so sore I would have rather gone without it. My SO was coming into the procedure with me so he got to change into scrubs, a hairnet and clogs. We made a very attractive couple. In the hour before the procedure I had a cannula put in to my arm. I have tiny veins which like to hide so am used to problems in this area but they managed to get it in really quickly and it was not too painful at all. Into this they injected an antibiotic which smelled like a cleaning product. I also had to swallow a sedative pill. Eventually it was time to make our way through into the procedure room. I lay on the bed and managed to get my feet into the absurdly high stirrups and the nurses tried their best to preserve my dignity although I gave up caring about that a long time ago. Although the sedative was calming I was still very aware of what was going on and could move and talk with no problem. I just felt a bit sleepy. I am not sure if it is different in other countries, but in Scotland, the procedure is done with an internal vaginal ultrasound with a needle attached to it. The nurse had warned me not to look at the needle. She said it was huge but they  only put the very tip in (hehehe). So I made sure to focus somewhere else. Just before the procedure I was given a lovely painkiller (not quite as strong as morphine) which was very pleasant and made everything a bit woozy. My SO was by my head and holding my hand and it was very comforting to have him there. The actual procedure was uncomfortable and at certain points it did hurt but nowhere near as much as I thought it would. It wasn&#39;t too bad at all. During the procedure the vials containing the follicle contents are passed through a hatch to the waiting embryologist who studies them straight away. So while you are lying on the table being poked by a needle, you can hear them reporting how many eggs you have so far. This helps to take your mind off things. The whole procedure is fairly quick and I was told that typically it lasts 15-20 minutes. </p>

<p>This next bit is a little bit gruesome.You have been warned! Unfortunately I had a complication. The needle punctured a blood vessel. I was aware of a lot of liquid pouring out of me and concern over my (already quite low) blood pressure dropping. The Dr was preoccupied with getting me to stop moving (since the needle was still inside me) and I remember him and the nurses commenting that I had a bleed. I also remember asking him if what was coming out of me was blood. I think that is the first time he looked down (rather than at the ultrasound screen) and realised properly what was going on. The staff were excellent. Because of the instant drop in BP I got very sweaty, dizzy and nauseated. This was a bit scary for me and I naturally worried that worse was to come. Luckily the bleed stopped of it&#39;s own accord and the follicles had all been emptied. As soon as my BP stabilised I began to feel a bit better and they wheeled me back to my recovery cubicle. It&#39;s an unexpected side effect and one which really doesn&#39;t often happen. But really, it was all over very quickly and it had no effect on the next step in the IVF process. 
I spent a few more hours recovering with a drip in and trying to get my blood pressure up. Eventually I was released and sent home (woohoo). I took over the counter pain relief for the next few days and apart from wincing a little when I sat down and a general ache in my ovaries, the recovery was fine. The bloating remained and if anything it got a little worse. I drank loads of lucozade forgetting that it contains caffeine and so didn&#39;t sleep for the first 2 nights! But it helped me to feel a lot better. 
I suppose that my story might scare people but what I am trying to say is that I didn&#39;t have a straightforward ER but I am still ready to go through it again in a few months. Plus the first bit was straightforward and I can honestly say that it wasn&#39;t anywhere near as bad as I feared it would be.</p>

<p>So I will end on this note; while I was recovering, my SO commented on how pale I was and asked if I wanted him to &#39;colour me in&#39; in any particular colour. I vaguely remember trying really hard to decide between purple and blue but I must have settled on both because apparently I told him that I wanted to be &#39;poo&#39; coloured. I can&#39;t see him letting me forget that anytime soon!</p>

My husband and I have been trying to conceive for almost 3 years. Initially we went to our GP at the end of year 1 and, after all the usual tests, were told to come back at the end of year 2, at which point we would be eligible for referral for IVF. Year 2 came round and we went back, to be told by a different GP that the eligibility for IVF is actually 3 years attempting conception. Ugh.

Our GP could see we were pretty hacked off so referred us to the gynaecology service, so that by the time we had made it through the waiting list and other tests the 3 years would be almost up. Great stuff. We had our blood tests redone and all were within the acceptable levels for eligibility. We did not have to wait as long as expected for our initial gynae appointment, where I was asked to lose some weight (have managed to lose 25lbs since), and we were told that, all being well, we would be referred through to the IVF clinic at the beginning of November.

I did the tests without any concern, and waited, and waited...finally I emailed the nurse as they never answer their friggin phones, and she emailed me back to tell me, quite clinically, that my FSH level had come back as too high to be eligible and that I could have it done 2 more times but if it is still above 8.9 it will make me ineligible for IVF on the NHS forever.

Last April, I went to see an RE (without a referral) because I already knew I had reproductive issues. I get my period once every 2-3 months. My longest cycle was 117 days. Thankfully, she took me seriously right off the bat, even though we'd only been trying for 6 months.

So we discovered I have PCOS, which wasn't a surprise. (Side note, I bypassed my gyno because she wouldn't test me for PCOS because I don't ""look like"" I have it.)

Then I had a sonohysterogram (which was the WORST) and discovered that I had two uterine polyps growing. The good news is my tubes are perfectly clear! That's the only good news I've had.

So then about a month ago I had a polypectomy, which was easy and painless. Literally no more than a day's recovery. My follow up appointment was this past Monday, at which time my RE was supposed to prescribe clomid, to get me ovulating (and pregnant!)

Well, the biopsy from my surgery came back with a tiny precancerous spot. So instead of going on clomid, I have to wait 3-6 more months while I get treated and cleared by the oncology unit. In the meantime, I'm on progesterone supplements, to prevent the estrogen from making them regrow. And it's making me feel PMS-y.

After months of being concerned about my late ovulation/short luteal phase, I went back to my OBGYN yesterday and she ran some bloodwork. Turns out my progesterone is low (not a surprise) and prescribed me prometrium. However, she didn't seem to know much about it and I have some questions about her directions. 

I was prescribed 100/mg to take nightly for 12 days starting on CD14. I don't ovulate until CD22-25 and asked if that made a difference and she said she didn't know. From what I've read, I should wait until *after* I ovulate to take it. 

I'd normally follow doctor's orders but, given that she wasn't sure herself, I'm checking in with you knowledge folks. 

I was CD 13 yesterday when they ran the labs and I believe they usually check progesterone on certain days, etc. In any case, my results:

She advised me to just be vigilant about how I&#39;m feeling and report anything directly to her after hours- even from the emergency department. Which I am glad to hear.</p>

<p>My husband has a stressful day tomorrow at work so he has been disctracted somewhat and distant but he&#39;s going for a promotion board (Army) and it&#39;s quite the big deal to us so I understand. But he did come to my bedside- since I&#39;ve been taking it extremely easy today- and hugged me with a huge smile and told me how excited he was for these coming weeks. Cue the &quot;awwwwwwww&quot; from me. We aren&#39;t very sentimental people but this IVF has forced us to be. </p>

<p>Anyway! It seems like the thing to do with announcing the trigger shot here and I&#39;ve been waiting so very long to do it that I couldn&#39;t resist. </p>

Then bam, 2 perfectly normal and on time periods, right before our first appointment at the IVF clinic. The doctor asked me to do a blood test in the 7 days leading up to my period. I said would be no problem. At 8 days out I began to get major achey breasts and some minor cramping, so I was pretty panicked that my period was going to come early. So at 7 days out I got the test. 9 days later my period came (2 days later than it was supposed to). Fuck. So I explained to the doctor at the next appointment what had happened and she gave me the forms to do the same blood test again. This time, I held out until 2 days before my period is supposed to arrive, figuring that that would give me heaps of leeway if my period came a day or two late again. 5 days later and the shitty, spiteful thing is a no show. At this point I feel like my body is just fucking with me. So it's 7.36pm and it seems like I have missed the window again.

132,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Recap:  FET transfer Aug 17th results in super low beta.  Not high enough to be viable says RE.  We stop medication.  Have additional beta tests.  Numbers are going up - not normally going up, but continuing to rise in a small amount.  Period comes.  I have maybe one to two days of heavy flow - also passed some decidual tissue.  Beta keeps going up.  

RE passes me on to OB for followup for Pregnancy of unknown location or ectopic.  OB is a semi new OB for me - we moved and I had my last annual done with her as well as she did my endometrial biopsy.  She's aware from the get-go we're doing Donor Egg IVF.  So she orders two additional hcg tests - both show an increase.  I go into her office this morning.  

She does an U/S and sees I still have a rather thick lining, maybe there was a pocket of fluid that could have been the start of a sac, but no actual sac.  She can't see anything else like tubes or ovaries because her machine is...  subpar.  That said, she's on this constant mode of how difficult going through the procedure for methotrexate administration is with the local hospital.  How the Catholics or nursing staff don't remember the protocol and how she has to remind them of the protocol for the administration.  How many hoops she has to go through.  All the trouble.  

And initially I was pissed that there were hoops she had to go through.  Mission Hospital is Catholic...  religion is finally screwing me over in women's health care..  except now that I've had some time to think about things I realize that all that bullshit isn't my problem.  That's her problem.  The fact that she revealed how much of a problem it is for her was unprofessional.  If she has a problem with the hospital staff then that's on her to resolve not to put me in a position where I feel like I'm so much trouble because I have this outcome.  

So she says she would rather do a D&C to remove the remaining tissue and lining.  Not a hard scraping, but a suction one.  But that even with that if it did't work then methotrexate would be still on the next step phase.  And I'm thinking about things...  and I can see where methotrexate could be a big deal.  I have lupus, I'm already sometimes dealing with a low white blood cell count.  This could leave me open for potential immuno-compromising issues.  But then my husband asked a question about risks for moving forward with getting pregnant - like how does something like this happen.  

That's when the answer turned into ""Well, when you try to get someone pregnant who shouldn't be pregnant in the first place, things can happen."" I was shocked and enraged.  That flowed into ""As my rotation in the ER, I see so many Egg Retrieval post complications and their fertility doctors just drop them to us to pick up the pieces...  I just feel very hesitant when addressing this problem when I wasn't the one who put you in this situation in the first place.""  

YES that's right...  those were even if paraphrased, the words that were said.  I looked at her and said - even if we had conceived naturally, this could have happened and I could still be here in this situation with you.  Which she agreed I was right in that respect.  How I got pregnant in the first place - it was a courtesy to you that I even disclosed it.  That said, I asked her straight up if she had a problem with me being her patient.  She backpedaled - and while I do have some sense of understanding on her frustration...  I as the patient did not come before her own discomfort and frustrations.  I was shamed by this doctor.  I have gone through every fucking hoop to be medically cleared and I do my fucking damnedest to not get sick and maintain my health.  This is not something that you can BLAME on me or on IVF.  Blame is on Lupus...  blame it on shit luck...  but you can't fucking blame me, my husband, or the method at which we conceived as a cause of our situation.  That is a non sequitur.  

From there, she consulted with some sort of fertility doctor in her practice - I don't have any idea what her credentials were.  She, based on all the information said no to the D&C and that methotrexate was the appropriate treatment for our situation.  It then came to me at which point I said they should consult with my Doctor at Shady Grove.  She told me to get a better ultrasound at the hospital and took some additional blood work and we'll see where we go from there.

After the appointment I called my nurse at Shady Grove Fertility.  I told her everything that had happened and what had been said.  I broke down in tears over everything...  I'm not sad that I'm not pregnant.  I'm angry that I have to face this additional judgement for something that isn't in my control other than not attempting to get pregnant.  Fuck me, right?  The nurse agrees she was totally unprofessional and urged me to contact another OB in the area.  So I called my high risk OB which I loved - his office gave me the name of an OB office they work with.  I've called...  went through all the rounds of the situation and where I am at.  I have a new appointment for an ultrasound on Tuesday and following that I will see the new OB.  I'm hoping we can just put this shit to bed and get on with it.  This nightmare has been ongoing for 2 weeks but it feels like so much longer.  

I just want proper care without blame - I just want to be treated like any other person who goes into their OB with a chemical or ectopic pregnancy.  I'm going through enough emotional pain as it is handling the loss of this cycle.  Why does it have to be harder than that?  

on another note...  I don't know if this surprises anyone here...  but I feel like all the doctors I have seen get some sort of shock that I'm educated, I do research, I ask questions or show my understanding of various treatments...  but at the same time I feel like somehow that might threaten them - like they don't feel like an authority figure at that point when I demonstrate that I have a basic understanding of how this shit fucking works and how my body works.  That they don't have to talk down to me and can use actual medical terms and I know what they are talking about - granted I don't know all of them..  but fuck when you're sick as much as I am or have a chronic illness I've come to learn that I have to be an expert on my own problems otherwise how can I effectively advocate for that?  

My mom says I should report her...  but she owns the practice...  how can I report this?  Other than online review websites or whatever which I dunno...  

TLDR: Something's wrong, ectopic maybe.  Current OB is bias and judgemental - switching doctors.  shit's hard enough, fuck me, right?

For reference, my ER was Monday 9/7 and my ET was  this past Saturday 9/12. 

I developed moderate OHSS symptoms pretty quickly after ER. Lots of bloating/cramping, nausea, shortness of breath/chest pain, and vomiting. Doctor was in contact and decided to go ahead with ET despite the severity of my symptoms (I couldn't even keep gatorade down on Thursday and Friday). He said that it wouldn't impact the probability of the Embryos sticking, just that the symptoms would come back if I got pregnant. Saturday after ET I was actually feeling much better though. I've been able to keep food down since then and I have been getting progressively better. 

Now I know the OHSS symptoms will come back as soon as my HCG levels start to rise but my question is WHEN? For those of you who had OHSS and still tranferred, did your symptoms get better and then peak again? 

My RE said ""it will get worse before it gets better"" but I'm actually getting better and I'm worried that doesn't bode well for my little uterus renters. I had a tiny bit of nausea yesterday that I thought was a good sign, but today I woke up and I'm fit as a fiddle AND my bloating is almost completely gone. I have literally lost 3 lbs since last night.

Is this normal? Do I still have a chance that I could get pregnant or does this mean they didn't stick? How long does it take for the HCG levels to start rising?

A short intro: I'm 36, and we went straight to IVF because of MFI. The stim process went really smoothly for us, I mean I was sick and tired of all the shots by the time were done, but the only side effects I had were some water weight gain and needing about an hour more sleep per night. We're doing ICSI and PGS.

We triggered at 11pm on Sunday, which I suspect was way worse for my husband than for me, since the whole IM shot thing kind of freaked him out. It was painless and quick, and both of us were looking at each other after it was over, thinking ""Was that it?""

We went in to the clinic this morning, with my retrieval scheduled for 10am. Around 9:30 they brought me back to get undressed and ready. I undressed from the waist down, and took off my shirt, but they let me leave my bra on (I just wore a lightweight, stretchy, no-underwire bra) and put on the super-sexy hospital gown. My husband was able to sit with me in the room for a few minutes, then when they were ready to get started, they sent him to collect his sample and hang out in the waiting room.

I had several sensors attached to me: two pads attached to my upper chest, one on my left side, one of those pulse clip things on my right index finger, and a blood pressure cuff that checked on me every 5 minutes. The anesthesiologist put the IV in my left hand, and I barely felt it (I made sure to hydrate really well yesterday to make her job as easy as possible) The IV was the part I was most afraid of, and it was basically nothing.

There were easily half a dozen people in the room, but at this point in the process I have abandoned all sense of modesty. I had to announce to one of the nurses in the room my name, my birthday, and the procedure we were there to do. I was happy to see that was required. 

I was awake for all of the prep, because they wanted to minimize the exposure to medication for me and the eggs. So I scooted my butt down on the table, the doc put in the speculum, and he rinsed out my insides to prep for the procedure. They gave me keflex (an antibiotic) in my IV. He showed me my ovaries on the ultrasound, and they looked awesome. He gave the anesthesiologist the 2 minute mark. (She gave me propferol)

This is where it gets kind of funny. The first thing I notice is that the ceiling is starting to look fuzzy (and frankly, I'm already feeling squishy enough that I am saying everything that pops into my head) I tell the doctor that I think the procedure is really interesting and he tells me they sometimes have people who want to do it awake because they're afraid of the sedation. I said something like, ""Oh no! No, I think it's interesting *academically*! I don't want to know about it first-hand!"" I remember saying something about this being the least sexy way to conceive a child ever, then I woke up while they were wheeling me out of the procedure room.

One of the nurses hung out with me, and they brought my husband back. I got the good news from my doctor that we got 21 eggs!

They gave me saltines and a sprite. I sat up for a little while, then we made a first attempt at going to the bathroom (I wasn't allowed to leave until I could pee) The first attempt was a bust. I tried for a few minutes, even with the water running. I felt like I could get most of the way there, but couldn't manage the last bit.

We went back to the recovery room, and decided to give it a little more time. I finished off my can of sprite and drank a second to try to give my brain the message. We got me dressed before we walked back to the bathroom for round two. This time I was feeling a lot more human. One of the nurses gave me a funny tip that worked like a charm: She told me to bring a straw with me to the bathroom, and when I sit down, blow air out through the straw. Apparently it helps the body relax the muscles for peeing. Anyway it worked immediately. 

They gave me 800mg of ibuprofen after the procedure, and my husband drove me home. It's now 4 hours post procedure, and I feel fine. I had a little cramping in the first hour or two, but now I feel the same or better than I did yesterday. Mostly I feel like my lady garden has been kind of manhandled (my left ovary likes to hang out to the back and is a little awkward to get to even for the ultrasound) I've been hanging out on the couch with electrolyte water (ElectroMix), a hot water bottle, and Netflix.

147,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I wasn't dead set on having kids until I met my husband in college. 

We graduated one year apart and I carried the finances while he did some basically-volunteer work. By putting off having a family and making other kinds of sacrifices, we saved up a lot of money. 

The thing is, with him traveling a lot, I was forced to change a lot as a person. I went from being really popular in college and constantly surrounded by friends to living in a new city alone and my husband and I barely doing anything together. I learned to be way, way more independent and as a result, a little harder and colder too. 

Then infertility hit. At least we had our savings, but we continue to rent because we don't know what kind of home we should buy. 

I thought it would change when we moved back to our home state closer to people we knew and when we had steady income. 

It was my turn to follow my heart and him be the breadwinner so I now only work a couple of afternoons a week so that I could help us settle in in our new city and make all my morning appointments for treatment. I have a lot of time to do chores and cook dinner a lot of the time but it feels empty with no kids running around. And I start to treat my husband in an infantilizing way because of too much time on my hands and nowhere else to direct mothering instincts. 

Meanwhile I couldn't just shrug off the independence I gained while we were spending so much time apart. All the free time and the infertility have made me an even bigger control freak and I don't know if I can share my life with anyone. We're both in the same city full time now and yet we have separate interests so don't do stuff together. I don't want people moving my stuff around or needing to worry about feeding or cleaning up after another adult, even if it means I go back to work pretty hard to support myself 100%. 

And I definitely can't share my life with this guy who I associate with all this pain, who breaks my heart to see around kids even though I still like being around kids. Kids meant him and he meant kids. Packaged deal. 

And screw this being-happy-over-getting-one-baby shit. We started in our mid twenties. We were going to have a lot of kids, like two batches of two. And he was basically horrified by the idea of a single child so I know he'll always be disappointed with one. 

I'd rather live childless but by myself than stay with him if this doesn't work out, and I don't know what more I'm willing to put myself through to make this work. How much do I have to drag myself through for something that might never come? And waste money we'll need to get settled separately. 

I already thought his family was ""simple"" but I always tried to put it more delicately than that, like we just had nothing in common. Now I see how they treat my nephew and his mom (another one of their daughters in law) and I'm horrified. And of course it's not objectionable enough to make them stop, but more than enough to make me uncomfortable (the 1 year old is teased about meeting girls at the library, all the comments are about how handsome and cute he is (CONSTANTLY)). Oh and my FIL likes Trump, while I aspire to be a SJW. Fuck it all to fuck. 

Our mutual friends are scattered. He doesn't like most of my friends in town. I don't believe him that it doesn't matter that I'm not into his video games at all (a big part of his life).

This all happened really gradually. It made sense for us to have hobbies not together -- better than not having hobbies! It all seemed so healthy to be independent at the time. Now I'm a frog in a boiling pot of water. 

So many couples have a life outside of their imagined kids and that's great and I believe you. Please believe me that I don't think we have that. I just need to know if we need it. Parents are always saying ""you'll never have time or sex!"" so maybe it won't matter. 

Is anyone harboring these secret thoughts that everything is riding on babies?

And maybe I've even sunk so low that we shouldn't even be parents anymore. I need to figure this out between now and our FET in a few weeks which I couldn't delay without saying ""because I think we should maybe split up, but I'm not actually sure"".

Certainly I don't want to be coparents who don't live together, and I think I'm too jealous to have an open relationship. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else looked around and realized their relationship was ruined by all the waiting and sacrifices they made to make a family. Or they think the only reason to need a partner so intimately is to share something, and kids were the major thing you were planning on sharing.

<p>Thanks in advance for your advice.</p>

My RE decided to do a cyst aspiration instead of waiting, which I was thrilled with. I went in Wednesday at 11am and the procedure was quick and painful, but very manageable. I leave happy and satisfied that we got that shit done. I go home, take a nap to sleep off the Percocet, and wake up feeling pressure in my lower abdomen. I go to the toilet and have lots of diarrhea and then I had to grab the trash can to throw up in while on the toilet. I call my dad because it's awfully suspicious after the procedure and seems like internal bleeding symptoms. I can barely remember our conversation because I passed out in the middle of it- on the toilet. He calls my brother who is visiting and tells him to call an ambulance immediately no matter how much I protest.     
    
I arrive at the ER and I have a 90/66 BP with a normal heart rate but my pain has increased drastically. Within 30 minutes I feel like I'm going to rip apart if I take a deep breath and my shoulder is tremendously tight and throbbing. They tell me to stand up so they can take my heart rate. It elevates from 84 to 124 immediately and they tell me....I'm dehydrated. I'm not a medical professional of any capacity but I've heart tales from the ER from my dad (a nurse practitioner) my entire life and I just knew more was wrong, but I wait because this ED is a circus. Kids screaming, people laying in halls, women yelling- I expected animals to show up any moment.

After the first episode of pain they gave me dilaudid because the initial 5mg Percocet did nothing. I calm down but am still in pain. my husband walks me to the bathroom because I can barely move without crying and it hurts intensely just to try to pee, but I manage. I go back to the room and five minutes later I cannot draw in a breath beyond a tortured gasp and I'm starting to freak out. I push the call button and I can't even hear the nurse but I say I'm in too much pain to breathe. Immediately after that I can't breathe anymore and I'm starting to lose consciousness. The nurse walks in, asks ""what's wrong"" and my husband tells her I can't breathe because it hurts too much. She doesn't act alarmed. Doesn't hasten her step, doesn't reassure me that I'll be okay. Doesn't say a damn thing but calls the attending and apparently got me more dilaudid which helped me breathe. Then scolds me for not calling her ""before my pain got too high."" I'm too traumatized to reply but my husband is glaring at her with a death stare I've never seen him give before. They did an ultrasound on the four corners of my peritoneum- NOT where I had a needle jabbed into my abdominal cavity- and say they don't see blood pooling so I'm not bleeding. Discharged me with 11 Percocet a few hours later. 

    Today I saw a different RE for my first follicle check (lots of follicles growing- one even at 9mm on day 4) but he could not count them because **my abdomen was absolutely FULL of blood** and it hurt so much just for him to look. He thought I had a giant endometrioma because there was so much obvious blood but then he saw that it was bilateral and covering my entire uterus area (don't know the word for this) and both ovaries and I told him ""I *knew* it!"" So I recount what happened to him and he's concerned and orders a hemoglobin test. I tell him I'm feeling twice as good as I was yesterday and four times better than Saturday and he says the blood must be getting reabsorbed so we don't have to do surgery and blow the whole cycle.  I just got a call while I was typing saying my hemoglobin was normal- so WOOHOO. 

    My dad, a 26 year veteran of the ER, is appalled at how they missed every single symptom and discharged me with internal bleeding. He's insisting I write the newspapers- lol. But I'll probably write someone. 

    I feel like what happened to /u/your_what_hurts is going to happen to me at the egg retrieval. I'm wondering how in the world they can prevent it.

175,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello!  I posted here (under my old username, which has since been deleted, so I can't find the post) quite a few months ago asking if I ""belong"" here... 

Due to illness when I was younger, I had to get endometrial ablation and Essure, and I wasn't sure if *that* kind of infertility was okay to post about here.

I was welcome with open arms, and I thank you all for that.  Good points were brought up that just because my infertility was a ""choice"" (though I hesitate to call it that, since it was either doing that or being bedridden and getting blood transfusions and intravenous iron for the rest of my life) doesn't mean I won't be having the same emotions and similar struggles to someone who is suffering from infertility for myriad other reasons.

And then I dropped off the face of the /r/infertility earth because nothing was really going on with that.  Then I turned 30 and figured I needed to at least get my ducks in a row if I want to pursue something in the near future.  I'm not ready for a baby quite yet (I'm in school to switch careers) but I didn't want to wait until the point when I want to try and then suddenly find out all my ideas about possibilities were pipe-dreams.

I emailed a few clinics and I had one doctor tell me flat-out (over email, without seeing me) that it was impossible for me to carry my own baby and I need to find a surrogate or adopt.  He also said that there is no way to remove Essure coils, and it's completely irreversible (I was not looking to reverse it because it doesn't have a high success rate, but I found about 7 doctors in the United States the *do* provide that service, so it made me question how up-to-date he was about things).  Needless to say, I didn't go with that doctor, but I was feeling pretty pessimistic about m possibilities.

Well, I had my first appointment at a clinic on Friday and I discussed with the doctor my history.  He told met that it is becoming more common for women who have had endometrial ablation and even Essure to come in seeking services.

The following stuff I talk about might be something that everyone gets done, but really I'm just starting out so I don't know if this is like ""Well duh"" or something different due to my circumstance.

What needs to be done to determine whether or not I can carry is an ultrasound of my uterus to see how thick the lining is (we had concluded that my lining had grown back after the ablation because I have regular clotting during periods) and then another thing (I can't remember what it's called, but it's another camera that enters through the cervix and looks at the uterus at a different angle) to determine whether the Essure has caused any adhesions that would make it more difficult for an egg to implant.

Anyway, he told me that ideally, mid-cycle the uterine lining is 10mm.  I'm pretty much right mid-cycle, and he did the ultrasound and we found that my lining is 8.6mm.  He said that is really great, and if I hadn't shared my history with him, he'd be none-the-wiser about my ablation.

We're not out of the woods yet, but I was so relieved. (And at the same time annoyed because it probably means I will suffer the issues I suffered when I was younger again at some point).

We have to wait til a different part of my cycle to do the other steps but this was a huge weight off my shoulders.  My insurance doesn't cover infertility treatments, so we are going to have to start saving money now....

I posted here (under my old username, which has since been deleted, so I can&#39;t find the post) quite a few months ago asking if I &quot;belong&quot; here... </p>

<p>Due to illness when I was younger, I had to get endometrial ablation and Essure, and I wasn&#39;t sure if <em>that</em> kind of infertility was okay to post about here.</p>

<p>I was welcome with open arms, and I thank you all for that.  Good points were brought up that just because my infertility was a &quot;choice&quot; (though I hesitate to call it that, since it was either doing that or being bedridden and getting blood transfusions and intravenous iron for the rest of my life) doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t be having the same emotions and similar struggles to someone who is suffering from infertility for myriad other reasons.</p>

<p>And then I dropped off the face of the <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a> earth because nothing was really going on with that.  Then I turned 30 and figured I needed to at least get my ducks in a row if I want to pursue something in the near future.  I&#39;m not ready for a baby quite yet (I&#39;m in school to switch careers) but I didn&#39;t want to wait until the point when I want to try and then suddenly find out all my ideas about possibilities were pipe-dreams.</p>

<p>I emailed a few clinics and I had one doctor tell me flat-out (over email, without seeing me) that it was impossible for me to carry my own baby and I need to find a surrogate or adopt.  He also said that there is no way to remove Essure coils, and it&#39;s completely irreversible (I was not looking to reverse it because it doesn&#39;t have a high success rate, but I found about 7 doctors in the United States the <em>do</em> provide that service, so it made me question how up-to-date he was about things).  Needless to say, I didn&#39;t go with that doctor, but I was feeling pretty pessimistic about m possibilities.</p>

<p>Well, I had my first appointment at a clinic on Friday and I discussed with the doctor my history.  He told met that it is becoming more common for women who have had endometrial ablation and even Essure to come in seeking services.</p>

<p>The following stuff I talk about might be something that everyone gets done, but really I&#39;m just starting out so I don&#39;t know if this is like &quot;Well duh&quot; or something different due to my circumstance.</p>

<p>What needs to be done to determine whether or not I can carry is an ultrasound of my uterus to see how thick the lining is (we had concluded that my lining had grown back after the ablation because I have regular clotting during periods) and then another thing (I can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called, but it&#39;s another camera that enters through the cervix and looks at the uterus at a different angle) to determine whether the Essure has caused any adhesions that would make it more difficult for an egg to implant.</p>

<p>When all that is finished, they&#39;ll test my egg quality, and then we can proceed from there. They&#39;ll also test my partner&#39;s semen, too.</p>

<p>Anyway, he told me that ideally, mid-cycle the uterine lining is 10mm.  I&#39;m pretty much right mid-cycle, and he did the ultrasound and we found that my lining is 8.6mm.

So, I had varicocele correction surgery about 18 months ago which did not result in sperm and was very disappointing as it was expensive and we had to go in for the semen analysis and eventual let down every 3 months.  After about 18 months we finally decided to move forward with Testicular Micro-dissection surgery to try to see if there were any sperm that could be extracted for IVF.  Since if they found sperm they would not want to freeze them, risk of damage, we would need to be ready to fertilize my wife's eggs right away.  This meant that we had to be ready with donor sperm in case I no sperm could be extracted.  We picked the donor, very weird process to have to go through, and were all set.  My surgery was unsuccessful and to be honest pretty painful.  
Ok so here is the thing though, and actually why I am posting this, its ok.  I actually feel better than I have in years.

I really like my doctor, and she explained everything in a way that was very easy to follow. That first visit was only a ""get to know you"" visit, though. We made a general plan of action and she sent me on my way.

So, the plan as of now is to wait until I get my period, go in for CD3 blood work, and then start my first round of femara. She said we'd keep trying with the femara for a maximum of 6 months before moving on to more aggressive treatments. In the meantime, I'm supposed to visit a geneticist, since my husband has hereditary spherocytosis and she wants us to consult with someone who can tell us what to expect with that. 

So, I'm just sitting her twiddling my thumbs, unsure of when my period will start, feeling generally useless. I don't think I've ovulated this cycle (I'm on cycle day 25 and no sign of anything, although I haven't been temping or anything for this cycle, so who knows?) Also, I work in a building full of pregnant women of all stages, and it affects me in such a bizarre way. It's like, I'm not sad exactly, but I just feel emotionally drained before I even start my shift. 

Sometimes I feel a little burst of excitement, like, ""Hey! 6 months! I might have a little bean in 6 months time!"" But other times I feel like it's a chore to muster up the energy to even care. I don't even feel like I'm trying anymore. My sex drive has quite frankly plummeted, which is troubling because I have an extremely high sex drive normally (any advice on this would be awesome, btw). I just feel...depressed? I don't know. It's definitely a feeling I'm not accustomed to, and I'm not digging it.

One last little blurb of randomness before I go. I think my husband is genuinely disappointed that I can't get pregnant for the first time since we started all this. He's such a laid back guy, and up until now he's taken the ""It'll happen when it happens"" approach. No worry, no stress. I was fine with that, because that's just his personality through and through. But yesterday he off-handedly mentioned that his buddy on the ship found out his wife is pregnant, and he had this look on his face...I can't even describe it, really. It wasn't sadness, exactly, but kind of like a disappointed half-frown. It was really quick, and I'm sure he didn't even realize he was doing it, but I can't get that look out of my head now.

I should preface this by saying that I'm no stranger to headaches or migraines. I've pretty much lived with a 24/7 headache for the last 3 years, and have had migraines for the last 11. I knew when I started the IVF process that ""headaches"" were common, and assumed that I would probably get the short end of the stick and get more than a headache. Up until last night, however, I had NO idea that they came in ultra maximum mode. I've never been in so much pain in my life, and I am 99% sure that I now know what it would be like to give birth out of my eye sockets. I ended up at the ER. 

Today, as usual, I went to the RE's office to get my daily dose of ultrasound, blood work, and their delicious kettle corn that's complimentary. I asked the nurse what I could be prescribed so that instead of having to wait for it to be bad enough to go to the ER I could just try to head it off at the pass at home, and she told me nothing. That I just need to go back to the emergency room whenever it gets that bad. That's all fine and dandy, but I nor my husband can really handle another midnight run to the hospital (why do these always seem to happen at night BTW??) and I really can't afford a $100 hospital bill every few days, assuming that this goes the way I'm thinking it might.... So that's my little vent.

The question is: are any of you unfortunate enough to be going through this also? Have you been prescribed anything? I suggested tylenol 3 because I know at least that can be taken right now, but the nurse poo poo'd it and said it wouldn't help. I'm planning on asking to talk to the doctor tomorrow while I'm at the office, but in the meantime I'd love some crowdsourcing! 

Just in case it matters I've been on 150 menopur, and 150mg Gonal-F. Tomorrow morning I start the Ganirelix, and I'm getting a bit afraid of what the outcome will be.

I&#39;m 5&#39;6&quot; and 172lb now when I comfortably hover at 150-155 with regular gym workouts and healthy eating. I sure hope it&#39;s all worth it. I can deal with 20 extra lb if we get our science baby.</p>

I'm not sure if you are all familiar with the situation in Québec. 

When Quebec launched its publicly-funded in vitro fertilization (IVF) program in 2010, it was internationally praised for its generosity. Quebec's current program allows couples to access up to 3 cycles of IVF.

The current Liberal government decided it wasn't sustainable and tabled Bill 20 last November which effectively puts an end to fully funded treatment and restricts who can access it.
Bill 20 would continue to publicly fund artificial insemination or IUIs.
By tightening access to IVF, the provincial government hopes to save $48 million (which is about 0,1% of all the expense in Health Care).

An article about it and the impacts on research : http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/bill-20-endangers-mcgill-reproductive-centre-muhc-says

You can read the Part II of Bill 20 here : http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projets-loi-41-1.html.

I'm 42. 6 failed IUIs, 6 losses. My AMH last year was .4.  I've been treated by 3 REs, consulted with another 2.  Husband and I have given up.  I stopped tracking. 

I think I know a thing or two about monitoring. 

Last week, I had a BFP. My reaction was well fuck, here we go again with another chemical/blighted ovum/etc.  My latest chemical was last month.  I ovulate crap eggs. My RE even agreed with this after another MC last year. 

Husband convinced me to get a beta. At ~15DPO the beta was 1001. Yesterday's beta at ~19DPO dropped to 876. Yup, here we fucking go again. 

My RE posts labs on a patient portal. After posting the latest labs, a nurse sent a message saying ""Dr W reviewed your labs and u/s and **everything looks good**"" (bold added by me). **wtf**?? So I called the clinic asking why THE F*CK would they say everything ""looks good"" when my HCG took a nose dive?? [here is a screenshot](http://imgur.com/iFVszqa)

They put me on hold for a very long time. 

When the nurse came back, she was super cheerful and proceeded to feed me some serious bullsh*t. 

You see, she said, it's good because the gestational sac grew over the past 4 days and **that is actually more important than HCG.** WTF??? I asked her to repeat herself. Bitch was trying to convince me that an empty sac is more fucking important than falling HCG levels **before seeing a hb**. I asked her sarcastically, ""oh so you've seen successful births after such a big drop in HCG at 4 weeks?"" Bitch says, ""oh, absolutely. In fact, Dr W wants to see you again Friday to confirm.""

Liar. 

Bitch is covering her ass for sending a portal message saying everything looked good. We're always, always told that betas are the measuring stick for viability before seeing a heartbeat.  When I had a blighted ovum last year, **this same fcking nurse** told me there was no hope because even though the sac was growing, my HCG was falling so I should prepare for a mc. 

Don't worry, I have no illusions of hope. I know better.  I'm just so pissed off that this nurse is trying to cover her ass by spouting this BS.  How do you do that to IF patients?? 

I've been stewing over this since last night.  
  
**Update**:   
I called this clinic this morning and talked to another nurse.  This nurse said, ""uhhhh, I don't know why should would tell you that...."".   She pulled up my chart and said that yes......**regardless of what any ultrasound looks like, the way my beta fell means miscarriage.**   I was like **THANK YOU** for the honesty.  It sounds f*cked up, but at least the past miscarriages and dismal betas have made me numb to these kinds of results.  I just hope this nurse isn't pulling this sh*t with other women just starting their IF journey.

The clinic itself is in the major hospital there and they offer a warranty on, if it doesn&#39;t work they try again if there are any remaining eggs ( medication not included).
