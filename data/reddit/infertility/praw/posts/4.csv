About me: 24 year old female and my husband is 29. I am a nurse.I am overweight as my bmi is 31 and I am really trying to work on getting that down. I have controlled hypothyroidism. Stopped the mini pill on June 22, 2014 and have not had a cycle on my own since. 
January 1st I took provera for 5 days to induce a period and then took clomid 50mg days 5-9 of that cycle. I did not ovulate as my progesterone level was 0.8 7 days after I got a slightly positive opk so we waited until day 40 of that cycle before we did the provera for 5 days again. Increased the clomid to 100mg days 5-9 and got positive opk's but my progesterone level 7 days after the positive opk was only 0.3. Still didn't get a period.
Waited until cycle day 40 again and decided to do provera for 10 days. Here I am on cycle day 3 and will be taking 100mg of clomid days 5-9. 
I am seeing an OB/GYN for all of this because the closest RE is 3.5 hours away that my insurance will cover. Of course there is one 45 minutes away but my insurance won't cover any of it because it is a different hospital system than the one I work at.
The only lab work I have had done is a prolactin level in december that was 19.9 and my TSH is currently 0.43 which my general endocrinologist is very happy with since we are ttc. I have had no other diagnostic testing.
After this round of clomid I will be seeking more answers from my OB/GYN or I will be seeking out a new doctor.

You try to offer advice and be supportive but well it still sort of sucks because they have won the lottery and you are just not that lucky. And on some really annoying days they talk about how hard it is to be filthy stinking rich. Everyone bugs them and harasses them, tries to blackmail them.

This is largely due to the fact that IVF is such a daunting prospect for us given that we will have to travel out of the state for every appointment and given his work schedule, I'm not even sure if it'll be possible based on the travel restrictions.

11,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,

I don't know where to start. Husband and I have been trying to conceive for 6 months. I have super regular cycles so was getting a bit concerned so he decided to have a sperm analysis.

That has come back, and his results are pretty bad. His number is '3' when 20 is normal and his morphology is 1%... motility is at 62 which from what I can gather is fine - but I'm thinking the chances of us conceiving naturally are pretty slim. 

Doctor wants my husband to do another 2 tests over the next 3 months. I guess we don't think about going to a fertility specialist before then. I could really use the next 3 months to get my head around all this. I am an anxious person and while normally I can get by this news has really thrown me and I have no idea where to even start.

I can't sleep at night for thinking about it all.

Not sure yet if I have any issues of my own, I'm going for the basic bloodwork next week.

I wish we knew another couple ""in real life"" with a problem like this, but all of our friends haven't had too much trouble getting pregnant.

We are both 29. 

I just feel numb. Also, I am trying to stop myself from googling, that will just make my brain worse. Although with only 2 hours of sleep every night I don't see how much worse it can be =\.

I've been trying to read through forums and Tumblr looking for some sort of community or understanding, but ugh. Forums especially can be awful soul-crushing places.

So I'm here. Married for two and a half years, together for nine. We've passed the two-year trying for a baby mark and are now working on year three. Damn it. I was so terrified through high school/college that something would happen before I was ready, but now...I have the job and the degrees and we just bought our first house in October (with extra bedrooms!). Frustrating.

When I stopped birth control (pills for a year, then depo for a couple, then mirena), my cycles seemed to immediately regulate back to twenty-eight days, but they were surprisingly light (which at first was kind of nice that I didn't have to worry so much). Nine months go by, cycles are still regular but bleeding is still super light, and no progress on the baby so I made an appointment. She told me everything looked fine and just keep trying, especially since it hadn't even been a year yet. 

We hit the year point, still nothing. Go to a general doctor because I was having horrible cramps/nauseated/general miserable feeling and I thought she might take me seriously. Spent $200 for a blood test to check thyroid and everything, but just ended up telling me that I was low in vitamin D. ""Just keep trying.""

Last September, call the first doctor's office because now my cycles were past thirty days long, I was still feeling miserable, and still no baby. Talked to a nurse on the phone who told me to go get another blood test. Nurse called back, everything's fine, and ""wait to see if it comes back on it's own.""

Since September/October, my cycles have gone to 50-56 days. I don't even know if I can count November since it was hardly more than spotting.

Is it really so very hard to find a doctor who even pretends to listen/care? Something has to be wrong at this point. I'm just so very frustrated. I started low-carb/low-sugar about a month ago, trying to lose weight (I've gained at least forty pounds over the last year), and hoping that helps something. 

My sister and two sister-in-laws have all had ""accident"" babies, and that's not mentioning the ridiculous number of friends/friends-of-friends/random people. I love my nephews so very, very much, but it hurts.

I didn't mean for this to turn into a rant of sorts, so I apologize.

I don't hate you. Yes, I avoid you when you come to the dog park with your adorable husky. And, yes, I try my very best to keep our conversations incredibly brief. When we pass on the sidewalk in the morning on the way to get our mail, I may mumble out a weak hello or say nothing at all. I may even glare at you in frustration from the corner of my eyes, or pointedly gaze in the other direction when you're near. For all these things and more, I apologize to you. From the bottom of my heart, I apologize.

You see, had we met under different circumstances I would have loved nothing more than to be your friend. You're a navy wife, just like me, and you're even the same age as me. You're kind and cheerful. You love animals just like I do. I can see your lively spirit from a mile away. Honestly, I feel like I don't have to know you to understand what a wonderful person you must be, and also what a wonderful mother you're soon to be.

And there it is. Everything in me wants to reach out to you, to ask you out for a coffee or see if you'll go with me to the beach on a Sunday. But I can't see past it. I try so very hard, because more than anything I want to move on with my life like any normal person, but it's so hard. Because here you are, in the apartment right below mine, in all of your beautiful pregnant glory. You are absolutely glowing, which is something I would normally say to your face as a compliment but right now it would only come out venomous and spiteful. Everything about you is beautiful. I often think to myself how lucky your husband is, and how elated he must feel that you're carrying his child. And then I wish with every fiber of my being that I could make my husband feel that way. You, sitting there in the grass with a blanket and a magazine, humming lullabies like nothing could be easier. I want to be happy for you. I want to talk baby names and shop for onesies with you. But what I want more is for it to be me instead.


So, as your belly grows more and more each day, please know that it isn't personal. I don't know your story. For all I know you could have been trying for this child for years yourself. For all I know your pregnancy is not nearly as easy as it seems from the outside. These are things I couldn't possibly know, because I avoid every chance at a conversation with you. And that, my friend, is on me. But you must understand the pain I feel. The burning jealousy and desire when I look at you, because you are everything I want to be right now. When I see you come outside to greet your husband, and he kisses you and rubs your belly and smiles that big goofy grin, my body physically aches. And I know all hope is not lost for me. For all I know I could conceive tomorrow, and then this letter that I've written out will just seem petty and immature. But right now, from where I'm standing, you have the one thing in the world that I want, and it hurts to see you.

Of course, you'll never see this letter. I would never in a million years dream of giving this to you. Now that I've written everything out, I think I'm going to make an effort to talk to you today at the dog park. I'll probably ask you how your pregnancy is going, because I genuinely do want to hear about it. I'll maybe ask if you want to go shopping this weekend, or if you want to watch Game of Thrones with me on Sunday nights. I want to be your friend, and I can't let my own bitterness get in the way of something like that. So, even if it hurts me to my core, I will try harder to be a better person. And I hope you can forgive me for how I've acted so far.

<p>Of course, you&#39;ll never see this letter. I would never in a million years dream of giving this to you. Now that I&#39;ve written everything out, I think I&#39;m going to make an effort to talk to you today at the dog park. I&#39;ll probably ask you how your pregnancy is going, because I genuinely do want to hear about it. I&#39;ll maybe ask if you want to go shopping this weekend, or if you want to watch Game of Thrones with me on Sunday nights. I want to be your friend, and I can&#39;t let my own bitterness get in the way of something like that. So, even if it hurts me to my core, I will try harder to be a better person. And I hope you can forgive me for how I&#39;ve acted so far.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>The not-pregnant lady in Apartment 33</p>

Did you meet face-to-face to discuss the results? In the past I would receive an email from my doctor with some kind of explanation regarding the labs. My OBGYN put the blood work in so the RE I a meeting for the first time on Friday can check it out.

I've been lurking for awhile and decided I should introduce myself. I just saw The Longest Ride with my grandma and left feeling triggered and depressed. 

Short story...I'm 28 and my husband is 35. We've been trying for 7 years now with not a single positive. I have PCOS and endo so basically my reproductive system hates me (my ovaries are especially jerks).

My husband and I are extremely dissatisfied with our RE after a year with their practice. Last week, we finally told the office about our dissatisfaction. I feel like ever since our very composed, professional complaint (really, no tears, no yelling, no anger, utmost professionalism) things have been awkward at the clinic. I have worked as a medical administrator in the past, and my husband is a physician, so we recognize that we may have higher standards than some, but we still can’t help but think what we’ve experienced is unacceptable. We’re considering changing clinics.... but God that sounds just awful. 

I will re-count some of the stories in an unbiased (as unbiased as possible) manner, and I’d like you all to HONESTLY tell me if I am over-reacting by pondering a change in clinics.

INCIDENT #1 – First Failed FET

Got our Beta HCG labs done on a Saturday morning (in December) per the clinic’s instructions. Was told the clinic would call us Saturday afternoon. Did not receive call from clinic with our results until late Monday afternoon. (For those of you doing the math at home that’s 2+ days waiting for a result.) We were told after that this “doesn’t happen” and they were sorry we were kept waiting. It was “unacceptable.” 

Ok, fine. Apology accepted.

INCIDENT #2 – 2nd FET on Transfer Day 

After having taken my Valium, the Dr. comes in to greet me and have me sign my form. I proudly tell her, a bit loopy, “I did acupuncture like you prescribed.” She replies, “Well unfortunately a study just came out this week indicating acupuncture may have a detrimental effect on implantation, so we’ll see. Alright, let’s get you back to the room!”

O_o

INCIDENT #3 – 3rd FET PREP, Natural Ovulation (w/ Endometrin and Estrace support), Prepping for Transfer Day

I go in on a Thursday after ovulation to get my sono. My IVF coordinator is “out” for the day. I have a substitute do my sono. I got a thumbs up! 

The fill-in says, “It looks like you’ll start your meds Saturday and your transfer will likely be on…. Thursday? I think Thursday. But your coordinator will call you tomorrow (Friday) to confirm the meds and transfer date.”

No call Friday. I call twice in the afternoon trying to get ahold of someone and no return call. I end up getting a message on Saturday, after I’ve already left town for the Easter weekend saying, “Yes, go ahead and start your meds but we won’t know about transfer date until your Coordinator is back in the office. She’s been out since Thursday.” Luckily I brought my meds with me on holiday, but we were still concerned about the transfer date since my husband has to pull several strings in order to get off of work and come with me to the transfer. It’s stressful to plan it all and he wasn’t able to be there at all for FET #2. My parents drove 2+ hrs to take me to the appt. 

MONDAY, my Coordinator calls, “Hi!… You were supposed to start your meds, Estrace, Endometrin and Aspirin, on Saturday.” I mention to her that Aspirin is not on the calendar she gave me, and that no one had mentioned it Thursday or Saturday. She says, “That’s ok, start taking it now.” 

I also ask her about an Avodril shot that was prescribed, paid for and sitting in my fridge. I ask, “When will I take the shot?” She replies, “Oh…. Right. We decided you are not going to take that shot . You won’t need it. Ok?”

At this point, I feel pretty level-headed, but angered and the inconsistencies in med instructions, and I proceed to calmly recount all of my concerns to her; That I don’t think it’s right that I had to ASK about the injection and the aspirin, and shouldn’t the correct meds be in front of her? And for that matter, shouldn’t the person filling-in for her when she’s out have access to that information? I tell her that this process is stressful enough as it is and that having to confirm and re-confirm my own medications makes me feel as if no one knows what is going on. She apologizes and says she’ll forward to the clinic manager.

An hour later I get a call from the clinic manager, who is polite and in service recovery mode, but continuously interrupts me and says numerous times, “I hear what you’re saying, and, please don’t think this is an excuse but…” Her “non-excuses” ranged from, “we have several doctors with different protocols,” to, “each of the Coordinators have different communication styles.” And on and on. I am assured by the mgr that communication on my record will improve and that medications will monitored.

I am assigned a new IVF coordinator, who I receive a call from the same day confirming meds and transfer date/time.


INCIDENT #4 Day of 3rd FET

I have received instructions from the new IVF coord that I will continue Estrace, Endometrin and Baby Aspirin until 10wks pregnant. 

I get to the transfer day and a new nurse comes in and says, “ I was informed that this is a natural cycle!? Right? Great! That means after today, no more meds for you, just pre-natal vitamins!”

Long pause from me. Husband becomes quietly livid in the corner.

I inform the nurse that, “No, actually, according to my coordinator I am to be on E, E and Aspirin until 10wks pregnant.” 

The nurse, flustered, flips through my chart, says, “Oh ok! No problem! I’ll just get this updated!” As she’s leaving the room she says with a smile, “You have to understand, we have 3 docs here and they all do things a bit differently… I’ll be right back.”

Dr. comes in before transfer. (Keep in mind the events of the previous week: my complaint to the coord, the conversation with the manager, change of coord, etc. ) Dr. comes into the room and mentioned NOtHING of this. 

“Hi. How are you doing? Great. Sign this… ok we’ll get you going!” 

My husband calmly asks her why the nurse would give me instructions ""stop my meds"" when the sheet in my chart indicates otherwise. The Dr. casually (very casually) says, “We do natural cycles less than 1% of the time here. She’s just not used to it.” (As if that explains why I was given the wrong instructions and was forced to correct the nurse.)

SUMMARY

I understand a patient being asked to CONFIRM medications…. So then why wasn’t I asked to CONFIRM? I keep being given the wrong instructions and finding myself correcting the nurse or coordinator and it feels WRONG. It feels stressful. I feel like I’m just a number and I can’t be 100% certain that I’m being given accurate information.

I think the Dr’s failure to address the “elephant in the room,” our dissatisfaction, is failure to acknowledge there’s a problem at all, which is really bothersome.

I saw my original coordinator in the hall. I smiled at her, and she frowned and looked away. 

Now I feel like we’re the “squeaky wheel” patients now who “can’t be pleased.” Being at the clinic suddenly feels wrong.

PLEASE TELL ME IF I’M OVERREACTING. I don’t want you all to just be supportive because that’s what you’re here for. I want unbiased opinions from those of you who’ve been there. Am I expecting too much from my RE?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for your advice and encouragement. My husband and I have been discussing it and we are definitely now committed to moving on. The search for a new RE has begun! I'm scared but also excited to know that we CAN receive better service and support. Cheers to you all, and thanks again!

45,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi there, 
I’ve been lurking here for quite a while, and figured it was finally time to introduce myself.  I’m 30-year-old American living in Germany and we’ve been trying to conceive our first since January of 2014.  I’ve been diagnosed with hypothyroidism (now treated), stage I endometriosis, and adenomyosis, and my husband has mild MFI.  On account of my irregular bleeding and immensely painful periods, my OB and I both suspected early on that something was wrong - I was referred to an RE in September.

After missing two IUI cycles (apparently I ovulate now on day 10) we decided to go straight to IVF: we did our first cycle with ICSI in March and transferred one expanding blastocyst.  It failed and I was completely heartbroken.  Despite knowing that I should prepare myself for failure, I couldn’t help desperately hoping and dreaming that it would work - the let down was crushing.  We’re starting the next cycle soon and I’m terrified of another failure and of the corresponding emotional devastation.

Although my FSH and AMA are ok (not great though), my E2 levels on day 3 testing were very high, and I’ve got a lower antral follicle count.  This probably explains why we only got 6 eggs from the last cycle, with only 3 fertilizing.  Two made it to day 5 (the other embryo is an early blast and we froze it). We’re doing the flare protocol again and upping the already-high menopur dosage, but I don’t really know if we can expect many more eggs.  And I’m so scared that even *if* we get good quality blasts, that they won’t be able to implant because of the endo/adeno.

Anyway, I’m incredibly grateful for this sub and for all the brave and wise and kind people here.  Thank you for reading.

<p>After missing two IUI cycles (apparently I ovulate now on day 10) we decided to go straight to IVF: we did our first cycle with ICSI in March and transferred one expanding blastocyst.  It failed and I was completely heartbroken.  Despite knowing that I should prepare myself for failure, I couldn’t help desperately hoping and dreaming that it would work - the let down was crushing.  We’re starting the next cycle soon and I’m terrified of another failure and of the corresponding emotional devastation.</p>

<p>Although my FSH and AMA are ok (not great though), my E2 levels on day 3 testing were very high, and I’ve got a lower antral follicle count.  This probably explains why we only got 6 eggs from the last cycle, with only 3 fertilizing.  Two made it to day 5 (the other embryo is an early blast and we froze it). We’re doing the flare protocol again and upping the already-high menopur dosage, but I don’t really know if we can expect many more eggs.  And I’m so scared that even <em>if</em> we get good quality blasts, that they won’t be able to implant because of the endo/adeno.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m incredibly grateful for this sub and for all the brave and wise and kind people here.  Thank you for reading.  </p>

I see some familiar names (waves at friends), but there are lots of new ones. To make a long story short, I was supposed to start stimming last August for an IVF cycle. Things happened really quickly after being diagnosed with--I believe the medical term is--shitty tubes. 

Two days before the start of stims, events started in motion that led to me and my husband divorcing. Yeah. I didn't see it coming either.

My meds expire in July and after coming back to a healthy weight after the divorce diet (stress is a bitch), I'm getting close to cycle for just a retrieval.

My AMH and resting follicle count have both dropped pretty dramatically given less than a year past between tests, so I'll be on the estrogen primed antagonist protocol instead of the BCP primed antagonist protocol. They've also increased my dosage of menopur and bravelle.

I have tons of friends and family who love me dearly, but most of them are in different parts of the country and none of them understand this process. With no SO to go through this with, I feel incredibly alone.

I've forgotten how to do the injectibles (that was my then-husband's job to remember) and my nurse suggested I attend the IVF class.

I know that my experience isn't the majority of HSG experiences; that most women feel what they'd describe as discomfort or period-like cramping.  Mine was white hot, unbearable pain.

What's worse is that when the radiologist came in, he kept saying that he couldn't find my left tube so I went from just being physically in pain to becoming emotionally upset.  They had me turning and rolling on the table so that they could get different views.

Yesterday morning, after spending WEEKS discussing, researching and maybe even arguing, I had finally found peace with only transferring one embryo.  I'm upper 20s, had 8 embryos that seemed to be mature/freezable, and felt confident that I would be okay with a negative outcome if this one fresh embryo didn't take and could move on to FET.

Fast forward to transfer time.  (Also, at this point, I desperately need reassurance whether this is normal or not.)  I am waiting for that moment where the doctor comes to discuss how my embryos are doing and whether we should choose 1 or 2.  It happens literally minutes before the transfer.  As in, I am in a gown, on the table, in the retrieval/transfer clean room.  Is that what you all have as well? I'm a little upset about that.

He informs us that we have 3 that are blastocysts, the rest are morulas with no guarantee of being able to freeze them (although they are calling later today with that Day 6 update).  The first 2 blasts are appropriately developed -- I think 1AA and 1BB; he is unsure on the quality of the 3rd one. He recommends we transfer 2.  

He immediately gives me the document to sign: Do I agree to transfer 2?  I mean, I guess, right??? The doctor recommended it, husband nods that he's in agreement, and I get excited that I might have a greater chance at a successful outcome (TOTALLY FORGETTING THE RESEARCH THAT I JUST LOOKED AT EARLIER THAT MORNING).

Fast forward to 2am: OMG. What if they are twins. I am a tall person I can handle it. BUT THE MONEYS. It's fine we can swing it. BUT WHEN THEY'RE 16 THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO EACH HAVE A CAR. No, they can share, it will be okay. Or even earn their own money and buy a car. BUT HOW WILL YOU STILL BREASTFEED. People do it, relax, it will be fine. Or use formula! Whatevs. WHAT IF ONE OF THEM, OR BOTH, HAS DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS.  That's fine too! Your parents were sped teachers. You are caring and loving and can handle this.  BUT WHAT IF YOU LOVE ONE MORE THAN THE OTHER. I really don't see that happening. 

And on it goes. I don't even know if I'll get 1 out of the deal, but crazy hormone brain is obsessed with the 'what if there are 2' problems.  

tl;dr: I thought I was okay with transferring 2 but now I feel like it was a rushed decision.

Edit: Got the call, we were able to freeze 3 embryos. I forgot to ask about their grades, but I guess I can always do so if we need to move to a FET.

Overall, my results are mostly normal. I have a high DHEA and low SHBG, which everything I read online says that is common in PCOS, but my doctor said you have to fit 2 of the 3 criteria (androgen excess, irregular ovulation, and/or cysts on the ovaries).

My husband and I started trying in Sept'13, and after 6 months I had a terrible feeling that something was wrong, so I convinced him to go get a sperm analysis. I figured it was quick and easy and could rule out 50% of any potential problems. I was floored when we got the call that they found <1m sperm, 0% motility. 

Fast forward 3 more sperm tests and 1 varicocele repair, we are smack dab in the middle of our first ICSI round. I'm finding the anxiety and worry so suffocating at times, and I feel like we just keep hearing disappointing news. My FSH is a bit on the high side according to the doctors (between 8-10, I'm 32), while I had an AFC of 18, I produced only 11 follicles and they retrieved 6 eggs yesterday, which they were disappointed with. We find out tomorrow how many were fertilized (if any), and I'm so scared.

To be honest, I don't know if any of the above stats are bad. I moved abroad to live with my husband (northern Europe), and am navigating all of this in a foreign language, and I feel like a toddler sometimes, only understanding a portion of what is said. It's also really hard to compare my results and treatment, as I think the protocol here is so much different then in the US (way less aggressive). 

Anyways, that's my story! Thanks for listening.

Update: So much worry for nothing, why do I do it to myself?? Unfortunately our clinic did not tell us over the phone yesterday how many were fertilized (that's their policy), only that we had at least one to transfer on Sunday.  Cue 24 hours of stress!! Just got back from the hospital where they transferred our 3-day, 8 cell embryo, and we were informed we had a 100% fertilization rate.

This. This is what is happening right now.   A touch self-indulgent? Yes. But that's just how I'm rolling today. 

FIVE. FIVE PREGNANCY ANNOUNCEMENTS THIS WEEK. FIVE. 

I am in that part of my life where all of my people are having babies, as I'm sure many of us are.  In one week my assistant, my two bests, my favourite colleague, and my cousin have shared the news that they are in the very early stages of expecting. 

But I am waiting for Wednesday, when I will find out just how infertile I am, and whether I'm looking at multiple surgeries, or just one big hysterectomy.  Whether I will spend my non-existent savings on IVF, or adoption.  Whether this awful gnawing jealousy will be part of the past, or an ever-present feeling in my future. 

... I am not faking it well.  My congratulations are hollow, and empty, and shitty and not at all how I should be reacting. I love these people. They are my people.  And they are happy. Which is amazing. sort of.

  I waited.  I waited to be married.  I waited to own a home. To have a good job.. to be ready, and responsible, and a grown ass woman.. and apparently, all that waiting was crap because my insides don't do what they're supposed to do. 

I hate everything today.  And will likely hate everything for a while as all of these people become fat, and happy, and get kicked from the inside by a tiny person. 

The days between now and April 8 feel never ending. I can't tell if I want them to go faster, or more slowly.  What I do know is that I hate everything, equally and all the time.. and there is literally nothing I can do to make it stop.  ... More waiting.

<p>I am in that part of my life where all of my people are having babies, as I&#39;m sure many of us are.  In one week my assistant, my two bests, my favourite colleague, and my cousin have shared the news that they are in the very early stages of expecting. </p>

<p>But I am waiting for Wednesday, when I will find out just how infertile I am, and whether I&#39;m looking at multiple surgeries, or just one big hysterectomy.  Whether I will spend my non-existent savings on IVF, or adoption.  Whether this awful gnawing jealousy will be part of the past, or an ever-present feeling in my future. </p>

<p>... I am not faking it well.  My congratulations are hollow, and empty, and shitty and not at all how I should be reacting. I love these people. They are my people.  And they are happy. Which is amazing. sort of.</p>

<p>I waited.  I waited to be married.  I waited to own a home. To have a good job.. to be ready, and responsible, and a grown ass woman.. and apparently, all that waiting was crap because my insides don&#39;t do what they&#39;re supposed to do. </p>

<p>I hate everything today.  And will likely hate everything for a while as all of these people become fat, and happy, and get kicked from the inside by a tiny person. </p>

<p>The days between now and April 8 feel never ending. I can&#39;t tell if I want them to go faster, or more slowly.  What I do know is that I hate everything, equally and all the time.. and there is literally nothing I can do to make it stop.  ... More waiting.</p>

<p>Edited for tantrum induced crappy grammar.</p>

For those that don't know me, here's a brief rundown:  Husband was diagnosed with MFI (the straight-to-IVF kind), I have no known issues.  Last year, we did IVF and I responded like in the text-book.  We got 27 eggs, 21 fertilized, ended up transferring 1 and had 10 to freeze.  Almost all were high-quality 5 day blasts, and we've burned through all but 2.  The first FET was a blighted ovum.  Another FET was a CP.  The last one had a good first beta, but still faded away.  

I had a WTF-discussion with my RE this morning.  She said she doesn't know why we haven't had success.  The embryos are good quality, but not ""hardy"".  They implant, but don't survive.  My current thought is, I'm not putting in any more embryos that aren't tested.  Period.  I can't take the heartache anymore.   The problem is, if we have our last 2 tested, I have to be ready for immediate transfer if they come back good.  As in, do all the medications in preparation AND have a flight arranged (we live in CA now, but the embryos are still in KY).  So it would be a big ordeal.

Other choices:

-  Do another fresh IVF cycle with half husband's sperm and half husband's brother's sperm.  We've already asked him, we would just need to do the legal stuff, but he's totally cool.  TEST ALL THE EMBRYOS.  

- Do IUI's with husband's brother's sperm.

I know this will be a tough process and will probably seem like it is taking forever, and that her mood or emotions might be affected by the hormones. Thats ok, I can deal with that. I just don&#39;t want to upset her by saying something silly, especially if things don&#39;t work this first time. I want to focus on her during this time, it would be nice to have a bit of understanding so I don&#39;t flounder when we talk. I am a few years younger than she is and have no real relationship/making babies experience.</p>

It’s my first visit here and if anything in the below upsets anyone please know it isn’t intentional! 

My gf had a fertility test and was given the below results. She is extremely upset as they show her chances of conception are ‘very low.’ I won’t go into details, I’m sure you all understand.

Without wanting to sound callous what I’d like is a simplified version of what they mean as I’m looking for more detail on exactly what ‘very low’ means. Basically, how low is that? I know perfect accuracy in predicting this is impossible but are there percentage odds that are the equivalent to the below? For example, do we have a 10 to 1 chance, or is it more like a 30% - 40% chance? Basically I don’t understand all these numbers they’ve given us as I’m new to all this.

I’ve tried to ask her this but quickly had to stop as it’s upsetting for her. I’m 100% there for her and understand completely so want to wait until she’s ready before we talk about it again. I turned to the internet for clarity in the reading but frankly I’m totally confused by everything I’ve found. The ExplainLikeIm5 subreddit isn’t really the appropriate place for me to ask either, so I’m here to see if someone can… well, explain like I’m 5 but in an understanding way? She is 40 years old and is in really good health.

Thankyou so much, and again I hope I’ve not blundered in and clumsily upset anyone unknowingly. I know how painful this subject is.

I was doing okay until I started spotting brown as of 8dpiui. This has continued until now, 10dpiui, where it has tapered off to almost nothing. That sign alone would be enough to convince me that my period is on its way as I will always spot 2-3 days beforehand. My boobs still hurt, but they could stop at any time like they do before my period.

<p>I was doing okay until I started spotting brown as of 8dpiui. This has continued until now, 10dpiui, where it has tapered off to almost nothing.

<p>The nurse&#39;s chipper &quot;Maybe it&#39;s implantation bleeding!&quot; didn&#39;t help at all because this happens every month and it has never been implantation bleeding.

I'm new to posting here, but I've been reading the sub for awhile! I thought I'd introduce myself.
My husband and I have been on a fertility roller coaster for about four years. I'm very healthy -- I run races, I eat well and I just like to be active -- but I have a non-life-threatening condition that we were told ""could"" get worse with pregnancy. Although it wouldn't affect my health, this condition would affect my quality of life if it were to get really bad, so this was a big fear for us. Luckily, some small-scale studies eventually came to our attention and calmed our fears. There's a great deal more to the story (lots of false starts with adoption and the like), but I'd rather keep this short for now. :)


About a year and a half ago, we decided to go for it and try on our own. Like many of you, I thought hey, maybe it'll be easy and happen in a couple of months! But it didn't. Because I have a family history of infertility, my husband and I were really proactive about seeking the right care. We have a great doctor now, and we just did our second IUI today. Here's hoping it takes!


I ovulate on my own, so last month, we did the IUI 50mg Clomid but without the trigger shot. This month, I had a huge follicle that didn't seem to worry my doctor (like, 25mm huge) and a 14mm, plus some smaller ones.

After several tests we found I was ok, or so we thought. We had one chance to try a low cost IVF while living overseas and we had to cancel as my progesterone was too high on CD 3. We moved shortly after and were lucky enough to find a low cost option through the military (husband is active duty at the moment) and for the last year we have been doing monitored cycles and tests.

We found early on that my vitamin D was low, fixed that, still nothing. Two HSGs over the last two years were clear but I have had consistenly high progesterone before ovulation. Nothing lower than 6 until recently, and even then it was too high for where I was at in the cycle. Two IUIs were cancelled because of this.

The doctor decided to go all out on the bloodwork and we discovered I may have non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

From what I can see a lot of women are misdiagnosed as PCOS with this, so I wanted to spread the word about this being a possible cause for women with mystery causes to their infertility. Basically, this is making my lining age prematurely so no embryo can implant.

- 40% greens and 60% fruit

- add 2 Tbsp plant based protein and a healthy fat to replace a meal

- remove banana to cut down sugars (not sure about this one as banana also has many healthy properties)

There was no sign of the small hydrosalpinx that was seen on the HSG. The RE who did the sono (not my normal RE) said that she wouldn't worry about it because the tubes are open (so no fear of toxic fluid flowing back into the uterus?) and its small enough not to show on the sono. The RE initially told us, after the HSG, that it wasn't dilated to the point where they would worry. 

Fast forward to today, our follow up appointment with the RE, and we did a run down of all the tests and attempts we've had so far: my levels are normal (except progesterone, which we fixed with progesterone suppositories); hubs' SAs were all good. I responded to clomid (but I can't take it anymore) and I ovulate on my own. 

So, he thinks this is a tubal factor. He can't say 110%, obviously, but that's his best deductive reasoning. My left tube is definitely dilated. It seemed clear on the HSG image even to me. He said what we saw with the HSG was the accumulation of fluid and it can accumulate and drain out and so on. But it won't get better/heal. He said because that one tube is effected it is reasonable to think that my other tube is as well but it's just not showing the same dilation/inflammation reaction. He said it's likely that the cilia are damaged and egg/sperm cannot travel to meet and that's why we can't even get a hint of a pregnancy. 

He said if we did move onto IVF (his recommendation) that we could have a conversation about checking out the tube laparoscopically. But he doesn't think it's necessary unless we have  2+ failed IVF cycles. He doesn't think it's dilated enough, and it's not blocked, to have implantation problems. And he doesn't want to do surgery unless we need to. 

Overall he gave us an 8-10% chance trying on our own and a 50% chance with IVF. 

We're moving in two weeks. I'll have a month lapse in health insurance. I'll be starting a new job. Earliest we can pursue IVF is June/July. That's ok, I guess. It'll be hard with a new job though :-/ but we'll also have a second opinion before trying because we'll need a new RE/clinic. 

But... His diagnosis does seem to make sense? I mean... I don't know what happened to cause this, but I don't know what else to think at this point. Thoughts? Insight? What would you all do?

My husband and I just turned 30 this past winter.  We've been together for 7 years, living together almost the whole time, and married for about 3.5 years.  We always assumed we'd have children.  Actually when we were engaged at 25 and planning to wed at 26, we thought surely we'll start trying for kids at 28.  That gives us some time to live together as a married couple first, and then change our lives forever with children.  Well, we got to 28, and talked about it, but we both looked at each other and said ""nahh....not yet"".    We really enjoyed our independence and pretty carefree lifestyle.  Then comes 29, and the same thing happened.  We just weren't ready to ""give up everything"".  We just turned 30 in December/January, and started to think that we might as well work on this soon.  We still didn't feel very ready, but all of my friends (older ones) all said they never felt ready either!  My sister (older - 33) just had a baby and we visited and it was fun handing out with her newborn....although she cried a lot.  For more context, NONE of my close friends have kids yet and all of the people we do know are slightly older.  I guess that's what happens with young professionals living in urban areas these days.  Long story short - there was no reason to have kids earlier, and we didn't feel super ready, but didn't really have a reason not to.  One of my close friends (older by 1 year) had said she was going to start trying, so I sort of thought we'd get going soonish.

Well, I'm pretty serious about my career and so I started reading a book called ""The Impatient Woman's Guide To Getting Pregnant"".  Seemed to sum me up.  I knew that as soon as we were ready, we'd want to get 'er done, if you know what I mean.  One of the things the author suggested was to get a semen analysis because 1) it’s cheap and 2) you can save a lot of wasted time if there is an issue.

WHAT AMAZING ADVICE.  

I recommended my husband do it and I think he was excited to brag about his swimmers, so he was on board.  Even though his primary physician said he really didn't need to do this if we hadn't even started trying, he still gave the referral.  WELL THANK GOODNESS, because turns out he has 0 sperm.  None.  None at all.  I didn't know that could happen, but because of great people here and over at /r/maleinfertility, and from doctor's stats, I found out that can happen pretty frequently (I work in stats and 1% is frequent enough to worry about!)  .  Honestly I don't know why the hell they don't recommend men just check this out when it’s so cheap.

ANYWAY.  Yes, he got it retested.  It's 0.  He also got a hormone analysis which showed his FSH levels are through the roof. No, it isn't blockage and no, it can't be reverse with hormone therapy.

We are now awaiting the results of a DNA test to find out of its possible for any sperm to be found through extraction or if we're only able to use donor sperm or adoption to be parents.  I won't get pregnant without IVF.  That's scary.  They might cut open my husband’s balls....that's scary.  I might not be able to have a biological child with my husband...that's devastating.

I just feel I'm in a strange situation because we haven't started trying yet.  Honestly we still hadn't when this whole thing started, so I just feel stuck.  I'm honestly grateful that I didn't go through a year of getting my hopes up and having them dashed every month with red stains for proof, but it's really eerie this way too.  Now I'm not sure if I'd rather have kids through this whole mess of medical procedures or just skip the whole thing.  And I don't know how I'll decide.

Did anyone else find out they were infertile before ever knowing if you were really ready for kids anyway?  I mean I always assumed I'd have them, but when the time was right, we just kept pausing.  Now I don't know what to do and we're both really upset that at least the choice may be taken away from us.  It seems to be rushing to just start IVF now because we weren't even going to start trying naturally yet!  But I think IVF is riskier for older women, right?  But am I young for IVF because we didn't try and fail for a while?  Yes I know I need to go to a doctor to answer my IVF questions, but it just seems so strange to go from not trying to infertility treatments.

Before I was blissfully indifferent to all things babies/pregnancies/kids, now everything makes my heart hurt.  On top of all that a girl that reports to me is now pregnant.  Shit sucks.

My husband and I have been trying since January 2014, and had a chemical in October, November, and just now.  The first two I had positive tests for only two days, whereas this time I have been getting positive tests (without progression) for over a week.  I don't know if I should take it as a good sign that the pregnancy held on for a little while longer this time, or if that is irrelevant.  

Anyhow, I am wondering what the next step should be as I wait to hear back from my RE with the results from the second beta test (which I am sure will be less than the 8 from the first beta).  The plan had been to move to medicated IUI (femara and follistim) next cycle, but then I did end up getting pregnant this cycle so moving on to IUI seems like it might not be the best next step since the sperm did meet the egg.  Also, what is the point in shelling out $1.5k for the chance at another chemical?

I am looking for some advice on what might make the most sense given my history.  Is there any point in trying the IUI?  Should I try to do Femara and TI?  Does adding medication to the process help with egg quality and/or ovulation in a way that would help prevent another chemical?  Some additional info: I am 34 and my husband is 41.  I do not have a problem ovulating on my own, and all of our tests have come back normal putting us in the unexplained category.  

Thanks in advance!

ETA:  My RE put me on progesterone after my second chemical just in case, even though my progesterone level came back at 15 when tested.  I was on progesterone at the time of this third chemical.

ETA2:  You guys are great!  I have been lurking for a while, but it is even more apparent when having your own issue discussed.  Thanks again.

UPDATE:  Beta went from 8 to 10 so definitely not viable.  RE called and all he said was he wanted to move to medicated IUI for stronger eggs (I guess because additional eggs being ovulated means more of a chance of one of them not being shitty although he didn't really go into detail).  I was too flustered to ask him why he didn't want to do any testing or why I would want to pay $1.5k just to lose another pregnancy.  I am so frustrated and defeated right now.

<p>ETA2:  You guys are great!  I have been lurking for a while, but it is even more apparent when having your own issue discussed.  Thanks again.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Beta went from 8 to 10 so definitely not viable.  RE called and all he said was he wanted to move to medicated IUI for stronger eggs (I guess because additional eggs being ovulated means more of a chance of one of them not being shitty although he didn&#39;t really go into detail).  I was too flustered to ask him why he didn&#39;t want to do any testing or why I would want to pay $1.5k just to lose another pregnancy.  I am so frustrated and defeated right now. </p>

I'm sure you've all acknowledged this but I am overjoyed to find a place where people discuss infertility with compassion and intelligence.  I wasn't really finding that anywhere else on the interwebs.

So here's my question / struggle.  My husband and I have been struggling to conceive for over 2 years now.  We have experienced 3 failed iuis, 4 failed ivfs, and now I'm pregnant on ivf #5.  Yay, but not really.  I'm pretty sure I've miscarried.  It has been a bizarre string of events and we both agree that the emotional roller coaster of this round has been worse that our previous failures.  I found out I was pregnant last Tuesday, St. Patty's Day, with an HCG of 42.  48 hours later my HCG was 142; then 501; then 1742.  Literally seconds after having my blood drawn for HCG #4, I run to the bathroom and am bleeding everywhere.  It was fast and furious.  I called my dr, my husband, I call out of work, I am hysterical.  My husband and I basically mourn the loss of our first ever pregnancy only to get the phone call that our HCG is 1,742.  The nurses and doctors think the bleeding was a sub chronic hematoma (still not sure what that is exactly).  Our hopes are raised again!  Like I said, the bleeding was a fast and furious and then was over.  I had no cramps.  We figured we were okay.

Sadly, today's blood work came back at 351.  The nurses are shocked and think Quest Diagnostics messed up and it should read 3510.  They are having Quest re-do the blood work.  I cannot get it out of my head that Monday's episode was really a miscarriage and now I have to wait until tomorrow to hear anything.  Two questions:  A)  If I was having a miscarriage two days ago, would my blood work still return such strong numbers?  B)  Is it possible for HCG to drop 1,400 points in 2 days?  That seems incredibly steep.

I'm just so confused and saddened.  I suppose I just need to wait to hear tomorrow.  Maybe this was a mistake by Quest, but maybe not.

Has anyone else endured such a complicated and confusing struggle?  Most of my friends get pregnant in like 5 seconds or if they have had infertility struggles, they've conceived within 1-2 rounds of ivf.  I'm feeling hopeless.  Sorry to be such a downer.

I included a little bit about our infertility below, to give you an idea of how long we've been trying to get this far.

Yesterday we woke up to a dark and rainy day and had a hard time getting out of bed. When I finally did, I put in my Crinone, walked around a little, and then had some Lucky Charms (silly though it may be, it was a good excuse to have it for the first time in ages).

Transfer was scheduled for 11:15, but an hour til, I didn't have to pee and I was told to come in with a full bladder. So I chugged a little over 20 oz in about 10 minutes and I left for the clinic with a full stomach instead of bladder. When we got there, though, I was really really miserable. 

My husband asked the receptionist how much longer it would be (it was about 11:30 by then) and she went to go ask. She came back saying it would only be a couple more minutes. I was dying by that point and starting to sweat.

When they finally took me back, they said ""so we hear you have to go to the bathroom, huh? Don't worry, this will be quick."" They were really nice. They had my husband change into these weird hasmat-suit looking scrubs, a hat, and booties. I changed into a gown, the hat, and the booties. My doctor greeted me outside the operating room.

My doctor said ""so, I know you had four embryos frozen. We thawed two today and they both survived."" I heaved a sigh of relief.

Then they brought me back, had me sign a consent, and let me lay down on the same operating room table I had my egg retrieval on. 

There were 5 people in the room beside my husband and me. An ultrasound tech, my doctor, the embryologist, and two nurses. 

The doctor put my legs in stirrups, inserted the speculum, and took a look at my bladder on the ultrasound to make sure it wasn't too full. She said it was perfect. I then felt her cleaning my cervix, which felt like something, but not quite pain. I didn't even notice her putting the catheter in.

She said the embryologist would go get the embryos, which they would insert into the catheter, and then once inside they would hold the catheter still for a minute in case I cramped. After that minute was over, the embryologist took a look at the straw to make sure the embryos were out, and then my doctor took everything out of me. She said there was no reason to lay down for any amount of time, so I could get up and go the bathroom right away.

I was nervous about getting up, because I didn't want to strain my uterus. I think they could read my mind because the ultrasound tech said, ""don't worry, you can pee, poop, fart, sneeze, cough, they won't come out."" 

After I had the best pee of my life, I met a nurse outside the changing room where she went over instructions with us (basically, don't run a marathon). 

The rest of the day we spent together. We went and got some creamy soup at this British pub in town, then I came home and had a nap. When I woke up I could hardly believe my two little embryos were inside me. 


Maybe later I will include the picture! One of the two is hatching and looks pretty healthy from the look of it, but the other one, I can't tell.


**""Brief"" history:**

* Diagnosed with PCOS in 2009, starting trying for a baby in early 2013

* Given three months of Clomid: June, July, September 2014

* Went to RE in September 2014: normal day 3 blood tests, normal uterine cavity, but anovulatory (already knew this) and the HSG showed closed tubes (we are thinking about getting a second opinion but that's a story for another time.) **Told to go straight to IVF.** Oh, also, my husband has moderate male-factor as well. Lucky us.

* Start stimming for IVF #1 in late December. Have my egg retrieval in January. Got 20 eggs, 12 mature, only 5 made it to blast stage, but one did not survive.

* I get OHSS (which sucks). Told to do a freeze-all cycle, which I agree with, feeling as crummy as OHSS makes a lady feel. One blast frozen on day 5 after retrieval, the other three frozen on day 6. 

* Start FET with estrogen patches and tablets, but my lining comes back ""unorganized"", meaning non-trilaminar (three-line pattern) in my ultrasound so we are told to start over again, try again in 6-8 weeks.

* Trying FET again with Lupron this time - lining comes back a little messy again, but doctor suspects we can go ahead because it's as good as my lining gets, and may just look that way because my uterus is tipped and the ultrasound might have trouble picking everything up.

Otherwise, my day 3 bloodwork was good and my tubes are open. That's all the testing we've done.

My OB has given us two options for where we go from here. 1) do 3 months of clomid only (no monitoring, no IUI) or 2) get referred to an RE. The upside of option 1 is just the low cost and the not having to get more serious about this.

His son is pretty nice and we get along great, but when it comes to who he rides with, it's always Dad. Hugs goodnight? Dad.

I wonder if I'm already so exhausted with my heart being broken with this infertility issue and with parenting a teenager that I'm not even ready to have my own kids. Parenting is difficult and frustrating, but as a stepparent I really feel it's twice as hard. It makes me debate whether or not I even really want my own child. 

Maybe it will never happen. Maybe it's not SUPPOSED to happen for me.
