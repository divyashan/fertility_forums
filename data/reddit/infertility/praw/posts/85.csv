Background: 34/F, DOR, trying to conceive for 9 years (have never had a positive test), 6 failed IUIs, polypectomy surgery 1 year ago, recent hysteroscopy clear, 2 retrievals, and 1 frozen day 7 BB blast PGS tested normal. Incredibly painful periods up until my polypectomy last year. Prior to being diagnosed with DOR I had suspected endo due to that, but no evidence has been found on MRI, etc. Laproscopy has not been advised.

Since I only have 1 blast we are taking as many precautions as we can. I will be starting the ERA cycle soon and will be doing intralipid infusions prior to the transfer.

I am wondering if anyone has any advice on how to cope with pregnant work colleagues?

In my office there has been 6 pregnancies in the last year and now the lady I sit next to has announced she is pregnant. The baby chat has already started and I’m struggling. Obviously I am happy for her but it’s still so hard. They conceived first attempt. When the conversation moves to baby related talk I get up to make a hot drink but I’m not sure if this is obvious and creates an atmosphere. I don’t want her to feel bad. And Im worried my female boss is getting pissed at me for making her feel uncomfortable (my boss has a soft spot for her). It’s so hard to work out what I am imagining in my head and what is actually real. Either way, I’m not sure how to handle the next 6months. How many hot drinks can I legit run away to make?!! Lol
I’ve thought about speaking to my colleague but I don’t really know what I would say. 
Any advice would be great fully received. Thank you

22,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,

My husband and all finally had our first appointment at the assisted conception unit after a scan in September, meaning that the fertility doctor at our local hospital clearly thought we needed to access tertiary care. That's fine, made my peace with it and was excited.


I've had several blood tests over the last 6 months and my Gp, brilliant as she is, also sent over a letter of support due to my mental health conditions - I live with emotionally unstable personality disorder and an eating disorder, though both are under control and I've been discharged from services for almost a year.

The nurse was incredibly judgemental about a previous termination when I was much younger and about my disorders - I said EUPD and she cut me off with a curt ""I'm not MH trained so use real words"" then made a face when I explained the diagnosis.

She then stopped filling out the initial assessment form - all the ""must fill in"" boxes were left blank - and said we'd need to ""see a doctor"" to assess whether a baby would be safe. Husband, being brilliant, cut her off and said ""are welfare checks also necessary to make sure my wife would be safe and can access the perinatal MH teams we hear so much about?"" And she stammered something about ""oh well yes that too""

She lectured me for about five mins about needing this assessment despite me highlighting the letter of support but all I got was ""mmm that's not enough"" so I asked who should assess me? ""I'll write to your GP""

The GP who has already sent a letter. ""It might not contain what I need"" was the answer despite not even reading it. Then she said based on my disorders there's a chance we'll be refused because I'm a risk.

I feel completely bereft. We've waited such a long time for this and a woman who doesn't know anything about me is making wild assumptions despite saying she knows nothing about MH. 

I have been on the receiving end of doctors making snap decisions, too. A doctor once decided - didn't assess, just decided - I couldn't work in my old job anymore because of my health and asked ""when are you likely to get over that ED?"" And now I'm so worried that'll happen again.

The only thing she did was take bloods for AMH but she cut the rest of the appointment short. Does anyone here have any experience of being rejected for treatment or have any advice about what I should do?

Thanks for listening.

As the title states, it failed, I knew the chances were low but I was hopeful.

IUI# 1 Specs:

Letrozole 5 mg CD 3-7

Trigger on CD 11

Trigger day follicles: Right side - 14.1mm & 27mm, Left side - 10mm

IUI on CD 13, post wash count 7 million.

Prometrium suppositories 100 mg /twice daily from DPO 3.

Period/Spotting: CD 25 (early), I'm not sure yet, I had enough blood to warrant a tampon, but only needed 1 that was about half way filled on Saturday and Sunday, nothing over night, nothing today so far.

We were both very excited to be trying something to increase our chances, and when I started bleeding Saturday it was very difficult, I vented to my husband and he tried to comfort me even though we were busy all weekend and were not able to process. I didn't cry, I didn't lay in bad all day, I was out and about and pretending everything was okay. 

We haven't really told people we are trying so hard, we just answer with ""when it happens, it'll happen"" when asked the question but Saturday night we were at a family house warming, and my husbands uncle starting telling him that we shouldn't be making our parents wait and we should have kids right away instead of putting it off, my husband lost it and spoke very angrily at his uncle.

We got home, got into a fight over I don't even remember what, but my husband apologized yesterday for the way he behaved, we've been stressed and he's never behaved like this before so it's okay, I think he's stressed about me.

We talked about trying IUI again or going right to IVF, we want to try naturally with letrozole over the winter and re-visit treatment options in March as it would be difficult to get around to appointments in Canadian winters. My husband is not totally on board with IVF, we get 1 free cycle as we meet the criteria in Ontario, and my work has coverage for the drugs we would need. I want to try now as we are both in good health and our chances would be better and not wait for it to be a last resort 5 years from now. He's worried how the meds would affect my physical and mental health and that it's not something we have to do right now.

How did you and your partner make the decision for IVF, how did the first round go? How did you deal with failed attempts?

Started doing IVF in Feb 2017.  RE had trouble diagnosing us so after 3 IUI's, we moved on to IVF.  Did 1st round, regular antagonist protocol, 8 eggs, 8 mature, transferred 2 fresh blastocysts, none to freeze, positive, doubling beta that was ectopic.  Round 2, saw that FSH had jumped from 7 to 16, so we did long lupron protocol. 7 eggs, 7 mature, transfer of one fresh blastocyst and one morula, none to freeze, negative beta. Did 3rd IVF at clinic, Sher protocol, endometrial scratch, 8 eggs, 7 mature, transferred 1 fresh blastocyst and 1 morula, negative test.

Switch Doctors to a smaller, more private clinic, better lab.  IVF 4, 2 months of DHEA, clomid, HGH, HcG, follistim, got 15 eggs, froze 4, 3 PGS normal.  ERA test done, late receptive, added day of progesterone.  After several cancelled transfer attempts, finally made it to transfer, high initial beta of 150, only to drop, confirmed chemical.  Moved on to next transfer, negative beta.  Down to one PGS normal.  Decided to go back to drawing board and do IVF again, same protocol, 7 eggs, 6 mature, 3 freeze, one normal, one abnormal, one mosaic.  Do 6th round, same protocol, 8 eggs, 8 mature, 1 frozen, PGS abnormal.

My question is...what would you do?  Would you do a 7th round of IVF and change protocol (minimal stim?) or something along those lines to try and get more embryos?  Due to travel/holidays/clinic closure, wouldn't be able to do another cycle until end of Dec. We have good insurance so I could do another retrieval. Or do I go ahead with a transfer and cross the bridge of another cycle and/or donor eggs when we get to it?

Decided to go back to drawing board and do IVF again, same protocol, 7 eggs, 6 mature, 3 freeze, one normal, one abnormal, one mosaic.  Do 6th round, same protocol, 8 eggs, 8 mature, 1 frozen, PGS abnormal.</p>

<p>My question is...what would you do?  Would you do a 7th round of IVF and change protocol (minimal stim?) or something along those lines to try and get more embryos?  Due to travel/holidays/clinic closure, wouldn&#39;t be able to do another cycle until end of Dec. We have good insurance so I could do another retrieval. Or do I go ahead with a transfer and cross the bridge of another cycle and/or donor eggs when we get to it?  I am 34 (almost 35) and our dream was to have 2 kids, right now we have 2 PGS normals...At this point I am very used to things going wrong for me and am just looking for an honest opinion of what you would do if you were in my shoes.</p>

I dont even know where to start. Sorry for the wall of text.
Im 27 with POI and 2 years trying. This morning I went in for my 4th IUI procedure. My doctor had arranged it differently than the last 3 ""to save money"" as he was ""advocating"" for me. He asked me to bring in a sample of my husbands sperm to his clinic. I did and everything went pretty much as normal. 

Until i tried getting off the hospital bed and was hit with the worst cramps i have ever had. I couldnt stand and laid on the bed for a while. Eventually i got up and walked to the desk where i felt light headed and still cramping really bad and had to sit down. I started sweating and became nauseous so nurses took me back into a room to measure my blood levels to check for shock. They monitored me for about 2 hours.

My doctor had used unwashed sperm directly into my uterus. He assured me that it was fine and probably just ovulation pains but honestly it felt so bad I was going to vomit from the pain. A quick google brought up that using unwashed sperm is not recommended with all my symptoms and my husband confronted the doctor about it. He denied it and said he has done it hundreds of times and it is fine. It took about 5 hours for the pain to subside. I dont know what to do now that I cant trust my Ob-Gyn.

But I've always been a bit uncomfortable with IVF and I dont really know why. On the positive side the success rate of IVF each cycle is 35%.

Today is day 2 of stims and we wasted 2 doses of Menopur before finally getting it in!! I’m so mad and also embarrassed we fucked it up so badly. 

Day 1 went ok, but the Menopur made me cry because it stung so badly going in and I was not prepared for that. Today, I was feeling better prepared and determined to be brave. I had iced my skin (thanks to helpful advice from all of you that I read a day too late). Then, as my husband was loading the syringe, it spilled out all over his hands and we realized there was a crack in the syringe. WTF!!! I was mad but held it together and went to get a new dose. Menopur comes in vials of powder that need to be dissolved into a saline solution. The ones I got came with a thing called a Q cap to use to transfer the saline into the powder. Usually a larger needle is used for this but apparently this is some fancy new “easier” way to do it for people who don’t like doing it with a needle. The nurse at my clinic was all excited about it. Anyway, it is actually a pain in the ass to use because it’s really hard to pull the Q cap on and off the vials. I slipped when I was trying to yank it off the vial after I’d mixed my whole dose, and I accidentally pressed down on the syringe as it came off the vial. So the second dose came out all over my hands this time. Can you believe that? I’m so annoyed.  

Luckily, my husband stayed calm and mixed up a third dose and we got it in. Now we just have to hope my eggs grow quickly and they have me trigger at the early end of the window.

Our story (TW: Loss)

We started trying in 2017. Despite being 35, my gyno told me after 6 months that I needed to give it a year before getting extra help. At 10 months I switched gyno's and she referred me to an RE.  We did TI twice in 2018 with no luck, changed doctors, and this year did 5 IUIs between March and November. One resulted in a 7 week loss and one in a chemical pregnancy. We are dx'd as unexplained.  We have decided to move forward with IVF. 

I'm struggling SO much with going to IVF, mostly because I'm in denial (but we can get pregnant, but we're healthy, but IVF takes so long yada yada yada). But here I am without an actual baby so, yeah. 

I'm also frustrated with my doctor because they are saying more testing isn't warranted at this point despite a miscarriage and a chemical. And I suspect they don't believe me about the chemical because my beta last Friday was 0. However, I tested out the trigger and had two positives on the Tuesday before the beta.  I feel that we are headed to IVF with no more clues despite months of trying and data collection. Apparently it's just bad luck of the egg draw.

<p>Our story (TW: Loss)</p>

<p>We started trying in 2017. Despite being 35, my gyno told me after 6 months that I needed to give it a year before getting extra help. At 10 months I switched gyno&#39;s and she referred me to an RE.  We did TI twice in 2018 with no luck, changed doctors, and this year did 5 IUIs between March and November. One resulted in a 7 week loss and one in a chemical pregnancy. We are dx&#39;d as unexplained.  We have decided to move forward with IVF. </p>

<p>I&#39;m struggling SO much with going to IVF, mostly because I&#39;m in denial (but we can get pregnant, but we&#39;re healthy, but IVF takes so long yada yada yada). But here I am without an actual baby so, yeah. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also frustrated with my doctor because they are saying more testing isn&#39;t warranted at this point despite a miscarriage and a chemical. And I suspect they don&#39;t believe me about the chemical because my beta last Friday was 0. However, I tested out the trigger and had two positives on the Tuesday before the beta.  I feel that we are headed to IVF with no more clues despite months of trying and data collection. Apparently it&#39;s just bad luck of the egg draw. The current doctor&#39;s office is amazing and supportive, though not the most proactive. Every time I go in I feel that if I don&#39;t ask the right questions I won&#39;t get anything out of the doctor.

Questions at the bottom, if you can’t get through the wall of text! 

Hi folks,

I’ve been lurking for awhile, chatted a bit, and figured it’s time to actually introduce myself and share some background. 

I’m 37F and my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for about 3.5 years. We had the usual first year of trying naturally (wasn’t quite 35 so the fertility doc refused to see me before it’d been a year). Did an ungodly number of medicated and unmedicated IUIs. Had (what appeared to be) zilch other than one natural CP. It took me a long time to accept that I needed IVF. Did my first retrieval in June 2018. Six PGS-normal embryos! Did a transfer, it implanted (low, but fast-rising, beta)! Thought I was the luckiest IVF patient ever! HA. I found out I’d miscarried that one at seven weeks. Changed doctors, moved embryos. My new doctor suggested offhandedly that I could do the RPL panel even though it wasn’t really indicated. What do you know - I have antiphospholipid syndrome. Many of those natural and especially IUI fails were likely early CPs (it got to where I had such test anxiety that I would not take a pregnancy test until I was two weeks late. My period was between one and two weeks late at least four times, after having triggered or confirmed ovulation). 

So yay, I have a diagnosis, still have five PGS-normals, all is good. LOL. Did my next transfer all medicated for APS (lovenox and aspirin, for the uninitiated). It worked. We had a heartbeat! For the first time ever! It was AMAZING. Everything was perfect. I had severe morning sickness - which after three years of infertility is fucking thrilling - until one day at about nine weeks I suddenly felt a little better. I tried to convince myself it was okay, long story short, it was not. I knew the exact day my baby died.

I’ll skip the emotional shit. You all know this shit is devastating. I had a D&C, because my doctor suggested POC testing “just in case” and I couldn’t deal with collecting it in a little jar. Spent two weeks believing that I had refractory (treatment resistant) APS which basically means time for a surrogate. Then we got the POC testing back - PGS was wrong. It was mosaic, not normal, which is what caused the miscarriage. Best worst news I’ve ever gotten. My relief totally overshadowed how fucked up the PGS thing was. 

In the meantime, my vagina exploded (at work) in Shining-like amounts of blood, which is how I found out I had retained products and needed a second D&C. So that was rad. Thank Christ we have good insurance.

Third transfer, in July: outright fail. I knew it would fail from the beginning, and the transfer was horrible. I should’ve just skipped the damn cycle. Waste of a perfect embryo.

So we’re down to three embryos and want two kids. Given our luck so far, three embryos seems insufficient for even one kid. So we decide to do another retrieval. Which brings us to today. Retrieval was last Tuesday, 15 retrieved, six mature, eight more matured in culture. As of day 3, we had 14 embryos (but seven were poor quality). Today was day 5 and two had made it to blast and were frozen. None had arrested. So we’ll see what tomorrow brings. We are planning on PGS testing because our doctor really pushes it, even though as you can imagine we have lost faith in PGS. 

ETA: it’s now Day 6 and we have three more good quality blasts frozen (the Day 5s were also good). Giving the rest one more day.

ETA2: Day 7, got one more (from the eggs that matured in culture, so it's also technically a Day 6). Fair quality. I guess they actually get yet one more day since they're a day behind. Feeling better about PGS with more embryos!

Wow, that was a lot. Sorry for the novel! 

So here’s where the advice comes in: should I do any more testing, other than the usual hysteroscopy, prior to the next transfer? Specifically, I’m considering an ERA (but does that even make sense if I’ve had two embryos successfully implant?) and ReceptivaDx. I plan to ask my doctor about these, but would love feedback from the hive. Also, how much do they cost? I very highly doubt that I’d have insurance coverage for either test, though I’d probably have coverage for the biopsy itself.

<p>Questions at the bottom, if you can’t get through the wall of text! </p>

<p>Hi folks,</p>

<p>I’ve been lurking for awhile, chatted a bit, and figured it’s time to actually introduce myself and share some background. </p>

<p>I’m 37F and my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for about 3.5 years. We had the usual first year of trying naturally (wasn’t quite 35 so the fertility doc refused to see me before it’d been a year). Did an ungodly number of medicated and unmedicated IUIs. Had (what appeared to be) zilch other than one natural CP. It took me a long time to accept that I needed IVF. Did my first retrieval in June 2018. Six PGS-normal embryos! Did a transfer, it implanted (low, but fast-rising, beta)! Thought I was the luckiest IVF patient ever! HA. I found out I’d miscarried that one at seven weeks. Changed doctors, moved embryos. My new doctor suggested offhandedly that I could do the RPL panel even though it wasn’t really indicated. What do you know - I have antiphospholipid syndrome. Many of those natural and especially IUI fails were likely early CPs (it got to where I had such test anxiety that I would not take a pregnancy test until I was two weeks late. My period was between one and two weeks late at least four times, after having triggered or confirmed ovulation). </p>

<p>So yay, I have a diagnosis, still have five PGS-normals, all is good. LOL. Did my next transfer all medicated for APS (lovenox and aspirin, for the uninitiated). It worked. We had a heartbeat!

Hi again, I apologize, ive posted a few different letrozole questions in the past few weeks and am back again with yet another. 

Quick back story: Lean pcos, third letrozole cycle. CP with 2.5 dose, miscarriage at 9 wks with 5 dose. This cycle I didn't respond to the 5 dose and was bumped up to 7.5. Still early for me (typically a long responder) but no response so far (tomorrow will be 1 week from the start of the 7.5 dose). One thing different this cycle is I'm kinda spotting now. 

(1) if I don't respond to this cycle, is there a chance I could still respond in the future (new cycle) or once you stop responding you're done? (2) what's up with the spotting?! Any ideas? Any relationship?

This seemed a bit too involved for a daily thread so hopefully it is an appropriate standalone. If I have violated any rules, please let me know and I will edit.

35F trying to conceive since January 2018. Started working with an RE in January 2019. Underwent standard testing including an exploratory lap to rule out a blocked tube and endo. Lap came back clear. Husband's SAs have all been normal. Our insurance company requires six IUIs before kicking in for IVF so we started those this summer.

We ended up having success with our third IUI with letrozole. At the first ultrasound (6+3) we learned it was fraternal triplets. Shock and panic set in. At the second ultrasound (7+6) we learned that one had been partially reabsorbed and the other two had no cardiac activity. The two that remained measured at about 6+3 so they essentially did not progress after the first ultrasound. 

Although I know it could be a few months before I need to make any decisions about future treatment, I wanted to get thoughts from those more knowledgeable. My main question is in my situation, would you proceed with the three more IUIs as required by insurance, or proceed straight to IVF (which would be paid entirely out of pocket) given the outcome of the last IUI? Also, are there any specific tests I should be asking for in light of three losses at once?

Needless to say, it's been a difficult and emotional two weeks. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. If I've left anything out of my history, please ask.

My husband and I have been trying for almost 3 years with a diagnosis of mild male factor/unexplained. We are actually in a 2 week wait after doing a frozen embryo transfer this past Tuesday 11/12 but that is a different story :). So- it's funny how I've sometimes thought that I wished I had a close friend going through this so I would have someone who really gets it. Fast forward to this week and one of my very close friends told me she just got test results back from a naturopath (not a fertility naturopath or doctor) indicating her AMH is 0.7. I'm feeling so sad for her and what that might mean for her ability to get pregnant and now I'm realizing I actually don't want anyone I know to every have to go through this shitty, unfair journey ever. I am so aware of how terrible it feels to get unwanted advice and one of the most important silver linings I've taken from this journey is how to be with people in their sadness, validate emotions and NOT give advice!! However, my friend just got this news, hasn't started trying yet and doesn't seem to really realize what it could mean. She was telling me she is on her husband's insurance that has no fertility coverage because the benefits are overall better. She just found out that her own insurance covers $15,000 towards diagnostics and treatment of infertility (lifetime) but open enrollment is right now (for both her and her husband's insurance). She is planning on staying on her husband's insurance because she figures they haven't started trying yet and it will probably be at least a year before they get to IVF if they need it (she watched me go through multiple rounds of letrozole only, then medicated IUIs and it did take us a while to get to IVF). I don't know as much about AMH- so I'm reaching out to this community to find out. Should I try to give her advice to switch to her insurance with fertility coverage with an AMH number of 0.7? Will it be ok if she waits a year until starting IVF or does AMH drop off that much over time? She is 35 years old. I really hate giving advice (and I remember so clearly when a friend was trying to pressure me to do IVF when we weren't ready AND our Dr. wasn't recommending it yet and how awful that felt). But also- will I feel bad for not encouraging her to switch if she ends up wanting to do IVF this year with knowing what I know about how expensive fertility treatment is? Of course it would be best if she could get advice and a plan from an RE but the naturopath giving her the test encouraged her to try naturally for 3 months and then go see an RE. My friend is proactive and is already making an appointment with an RE but she's not going to talk with that RE before open enrollment ends.

Part of this post is to share my story in case it is helpful for anyone else, part of it is to ask a question.

I had my HSG test last week and I passed out at the clinic following it. I almost passed out on the table directly following the test, but I told the PA that I was feeling light-headed and she had me lay down for around 10 minutes and gave me a cold ice pack for my neck and forehead until I got feeling substantially better. I felt like I was going to either throw up or lose consciousness while I was laying there, but luckily I avoided the former. After a while I sat up again and somehow the medical staff decided that (maybe based on my still low-blood pressure?) they would wheel me into the changing room, rather than have me walk. Unfortunately, almost immediately after I moved to the rolling chair, I passed out. It was a bad loss of consciousness and I awoke with the PA and nurse yelling at (?) or shaking me --couldn't really tell-- I was very disoriented and didn't know where I was at first. I continued to feel nauseated after I left the clinic and it took most of the day to recover.

Based on the results of the HSG they ordered a saline sonogram for today. This appointment went substantially better than the HSG, perhaps because the PA this time knew that I'd passed out during the HSG and so was very careful to walk me through the procedure and give me tips for how to stay conscious (LOL). I rested on the exam table for a few extra minutes afterwards at her instruction, and then left the clinic without incident. I even returned to work afterwards. However, shortly after returning to work, while walking down the hallway my vision started to ""grey out"" and I started to lose some feeling in my extremities (signs passing out is imminent). I had a lunch scheduled with colleagues so I was stupidly determined to tough it out, but while walking to lunch I felt woozy and was seriously worried I'd fall over right on the sidewalk. I was sweating bullets. I went home after lunch.

Anyway, a question: 1) has anyone else had this issue, if so how did you manage it during treatment, like IUI or IVF? (I ate breakfast both mornings and drank fluids beforehand, so I don't think that's going to fix it). 2) I guess this means I should plan to feel sick for all future procedures?

Thank you!

I'm 36 with no official infertility diagnosis. AMH is 1.91 and I was a poor responder to IVF stims and also have sub-clinical hypothyroidsim for which I'm taking Levothyoxine. Husband has MFI. It took us 3 retrievals to get 4 PGS normal embryos.

My first transfer was three weeks ago with a 4AB embryo. My lining was over 11mm and my cycle was medicated with 2mg Estradiol twice daily and 1mL PIO once daily. No uterine issues. Despite everything being ""perfect"" the transfer failed completely. Hcg was zero. No implantation at all. We have 3 more embryos on ice, however, I am nervous to do another transfer without some answers. I've researched ERA and Receptivadx though my RE does not recommend these tests and basically told me I'd be wasting my money. I've been looking for answers regarding implantation failure. Everything I've read chalks up failure to thin lining (which I didn't have) or talks about low/dropping Hcg levels (mine was zero). I am very concerned that there was no implantation at all. My RE has ordered a uterine biopsy and blood panel and I am wanting on those results. Has anyone else had FET implantation failure with a thick lining and zero Hcg and then go onto have success? I am just really concerned that there was zero implantation. Does this mean there is an undetected endometrial issue? My RE keeps saying it's an embryonic issue or just ""bad luck"".

Edited to add: I had really bad uterine contractions the morning after the transfer (about 12 hours after - transfer was at 2:30PM). I woke up at 2:30am from the contractions because there were so bad. I have never felt anything like that in my entire life. I asked a nurse about it and she said they were normal. Then I asked the RE who said that's NOT normal at all. I will always wonder if those contractions expelled the embryo or prevented implantation.

Despite everything being &quot;perfect&quot; the transfer failed completely. Hcg was zero. No implantation at all. We have 3 more embryos on ice, however, I am nervous to do another transfer without some answers. I&#39;ve researched ERA and Receptivadx though my RE does not recommend these tests and basically told me I&#39;d be wasting my money. I&#39;ve been looking for answers regarding implantation failure. Everything I&#39;ve read chalks up failure to thin lining (which I didn&#39;t have) or talks about low/dropping Hcg levels (mine was zero). I am very concerned that there was no implantation at all. My RE has ordered a uterine biopsy and blood panel and I am wanting on those results. Has anyone else had FET implantation failure with a thick lining and zero Hcg and then go onto have success? I am just really concerned that there was zero implantation. Does this mean there is an undetected endometrial issue? My RE keeps saying it&#39;s an embryonic issue or just &quot;bad luck&quot;.</p>

<p>Edited to add: I had really bad uterine contractions the morning after the transfer (about 12 hours after - transfer was at 2:30PM). I woke up at 2:30am from the contractions because there were so bad. I have never felt anything like that in my entire life. I asked a nurse about it and she said they were normal. Then I asked the RE who said that&#39;s NOT normal at all. I will always wonder if those contractions expelled the embryo or prevented implantation. RE is upping my PIO from 50mg to 75mg for the next transfer. Did anyone else ever have contractions following FET?</p>

197,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,

As I wrote in an earlier post, I had a failed IVF cycle in which all 7 embryos that developed were found to be abnormal by genetic testing (various manners of trisomy and monosomy).

We switched clinics and our new doctor asked us if our sperm donor was taking any medication for hair loss. Turns out he was. Our sperm donor has not taken the medication now for about 5 weeks and we are thinking of trying again.

My period started today so...if we're doing this, it's GO TIME.

My question is: should we wait another month? I'm worried because this will likely be our last shot at IVF. However, waiting is very inconvenient as we are moving across the world (Asia to US) in a few months. If we wait, we may very well have to move and leave frozen embryos to be implanted on a later visit. Is it worth it to wait?

This is so stressful and difficult to decide. I would really love your input, if you have any knowledge of this or just advice on how I should think this through I would be most grateful.

I WISH I knew the name of the hair loss medication he was taking, but his ""hair doctor"" (as he calls him) just gave him some medication, apparently without any proper identification of what was in it. Things are a bit different out here.

Hello all - New around here and can't believe its taken me so long to find this group. I think because for so long I was just waiting to get pregnant (again). Anyway - 4 years ago I got pregnant, lost that baby at 14 weeks (and had a perforated uterus during my first D&C) Got pregnant again 3 years ago and lost that baby girl at 16 weeks. No pregnancy since. In that time I saw multiple MFMs to address the repeat loss (but so far nothing has been found) and we continued to try to get pregnant. Then my Father in law got sick and passed away which increased stress and decreased the focus on baby. But we've been trying going on 24 months. Finally last spring I started pursuing testing - and after so much reluctance from my OB - we had my husband's sperm tested - he lost 80 lbs since the last pregnancy so people said there was no way it was him. It is. He has a varicocele and low total motile sperm counts. Urologist said we should just do IUI for a few rounds and jump to IVF but RE I saw recently thinks husband should fix varicocele while we also try IUI. So here we are. My blood tests are pretty good - I had a few polyps removed from uterus in June but AMH, FSH, etc are good. I did see an RE who focuses on repeat loss and she found nothing - just told me to lose 10 lbs to try and lower my blood pressure.  


But I'm suddenly feeling not so motivated to keep on trying? Maybe its because we got the prices for IUI and IVF and the sticker shock blew me away. Probably I'm mostly really scared that ART won't work OR it will but I won't stay pregnant (current RE is willing to put me on Lovenox while pregnant)  


So, hello - mostly just reading from afar and thankful for everyone for sharing so much and helping me learn and navigate. Oh, I'm 38, so is husband, we live in Bay Area - he's an attorney and I'm a college professor. I'm pretty evidence based and unless I'm part of a clinical trial I won't try anything controversial in literature (aka - no IVIG treatments or killer T-cell investigations....)",t2_4y7zkdro,False,,0,False,Introduction Post: Male Factor & Repeat Loss,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_dvj490,False,dark,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,self,,False,,[],{},,True,,1573632438.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>CW - Pregnancy &amp; Pregnancy Loss included.</p>

212,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub but I couldn’t figure out where to ask this question:

I’m 26F and just got engaged. I’ve been on continuous birth control since I was 19, a version of Seasonique where I only get my period every 12 weeks or 4x a year. The reason I went on this method is because I was very very irregular growing up. I got my first period at 13/14 and it was never monthly. I would go 3-4 months without a period and then suddenly have one. In HS it was a bit more regular, sometimes every other month. But one year I don’t think I got it for 6 months. At the time I asked my PCP if she thought this was concerning but she just said irregularity was common when first getting a period and it would become more regular as I got older. When I got to college I still wasn’t getting it regularly and it was very hard to guess when I would get it. I’d go 3 months without it or any PMS symptoms and then suddenly I’d have it for 3-4 days, then nothing for a few weeks and then I’d get it again. It became so hard to track that I went on birth control just to get regular and at first I did a month to month version. However since I was just not used to having a period every month it was really stressful and kept giving me yeast infections. After talking to my doctor they recommended the seasonique version I’ve been on for the last 4 years. 

All of this background is to say that I recently asked my doctor if he thought I would have trouble conceiving because of my history with irregularity. He said I most likely would but that I was still young and I shouldn’t immediately assume the worst. I’m on this sub asking if anyone else had history of irregularity and also had issues conceiving. I’m also wondering if there is any method to test my fertility at this time. My main concern is that we don’t want to try having kids until we are around 29-32 due to career and financial constraints. I’m just worried that waiting till I’m at that age will only add to problems with getting pregnant. Personally, I think I’ve always known it’d be hard to get pregnant so I’ve subconsciously come to terms with it and think that I will be okay if it doesn’t happen for me. But my fiancé has expressed he definitely wants to be a dad some day, I’ve told him about my concerns but he just says that we will deal with it when the time comes and he still wants to marry me even if kids aren’t in the cards for us.

<p>I’m 26F and just got engaged. I’ve been on continuous birth control since I was 19, a version of Seasonique where I only get my period every 12 weeks or 4x a year. The reason I went on this method is because I was very very irregular growing up. I got my first period at 13/14 and it was never monthly. I would go 3-4 months without a period and then suddenly have one. In HS it was a bit more regular, sometimes every other month. But one year I don’t think I got it for 6 months. At the time I asked my PCP if she thought this was concerning but she just said irregularity was common when first getting a period and it would become more regular as I got older. When I got to college I still wasn’t getting it regularly and it was very hard to guess when I would get it. I’d go 3 months without it or any PMS symptoms and then suddenly I’d have it for 3-4 days, then nothing for a few weeks and then I’d get it again. It became so hard to track that I went on birth control just to get regular and at first I did a month to month version. However since I was just not used to having a period every month it was really stressful and kept giving me yeast infections. After talking to my doctor they recommended the seasonique version I’ve been on for the last 4 years. </p>

<p>All of this background is to say that I recently asked my doctor if he thought I would have trouble conceiving because of my history with irregularity. He said I most likely would but that I was still young and I shouldn’t immediately assume the worst. I’m on this sub asking if anyone else had history of irregularity and also had issues conceiving. I’m also wondering if there is any method to test my fertility at this time. My main concern is that we don’t want to try having kids until we are around 29-32 due to career and financial constraints. I’m just worried that waiting till I’m at that age will only add to problems with getting pregnant. Personally, I think I’ve always known it’d be hard to get pregnant so I’ve subconsciously come to terms with it and think that I will be okay if it doesn’t happen for me. But my fiancé has expressed he definitely wants to be a dad some day, I’ve told him about my concerns but he just says that we will deal with it when the time comes and he still wants to marry me even if kids aren’t in the cards for us. I worry he isn’t taking it seriously so I kinda want to get a better picture of my fertility status before we get married. If there’s really zero chance of me getting pregnant I want him to have the whole picture before committing to us, I don’t want him to regret this choice in a few years. </p>

My name is Chloe. 
I’m not sure if I’ve introduced myself here before or not.  I started on TFAB years ago and took a long break from looking at any of the TTC sub Reddits.  

My husband and I have been TTC for 2.5 years.  I just turned 36.  We are still diagnosed unexplained.  Did 3 IUIs in the summer and this past month did our first retrieval.  They took out 17 eggs, 10 fertilized, then only 3 made it to blastocyst.  2 looked “good” and 1 looked “fair/poor”.  Friday night they called with the results of the PGS testing and the only one with the right number of chromosomes was the fair/poor one.  So now we have one. 

I haven’t been able to talk to my doctor yet, but I’m confused about why our results were so much worse than everyone was telling us they would be.  My doctor thought we’d get at least 3-4 embryos.  Maybe just bad luck? 

Anyway, I’m trying to process all of this.  I’m guessing they will still recommend trying a transfer?  I’m not sure the chance it will work, but I feel like the last thing I was told was around 40%.  If that doesn’t work then we’re back to square one and down over $20,000.  I’m sure there are many, many of you here who relate.  

I’m posting here because I’m not great at keeping up with the dailies, but I would love if anyone is in a similar place and wants someone to talk to, to start a regular chat.

258,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to this thread. In fact, I've never used reddit before. I stumbled upon this thread in the same way I'm sure many of you did -- googling around. Reading the community rules, I sighed a huge sigh of relief. So, thanks to the moderators, whoever you are. Most other infertility message boards make me feel even worse...

My wife and I live in Southeast Asia. My wife's brother kindly offered to be our sperm donor. We tried at-home insemination on and off for a year. It was tricky though because he lives in a different city than us and we all work full-time. Scheduling visits right at the time of my ovulation was difficult and stressful. Needless to say, that didn't work. But I figured that was just because of logistics, not because of any underlying fertility issue.

This September we finally decided to do IVF. I'm not getting any younger (I'm 38 now) and my wife and I are going to move to the US soon. So, time is short.

I don't know if this is common, but I went into my first round of IVF very excited and confident. I happily gave up coffee and beer (both of which I love). I felt like I would be pregnant soon.

Short protocol. 14 eggs on egg retrieval day - good! 10 fertilized - good good! genetic testing...all abnormal. Devastating. I felt an intensity of heart break that I was not prepared for.

I felt exhausted through October. I struggled with work. I teach at a university and I also teach piano on weekends. Suddenly working with all these lovely young people made me want to cry. I managed to stay professional, but it was tough at times. Now, I pulling myself back together and my wife and I are getting ready to try again.

For financial reasons, and because we are leaving for North America soon, this may be our last shot -- at least our last shot with my eggs. My wife and I may consider embryo donation in the US if this doesn't work. She does not want to get pregnant herself. I'm trying to go into this round of IVF with more realistic expectations. It may work. It may not. Now I know better.

If I may end with one question: how many months is it recommended to wait between egg retrievals? If I did it in September, is it reasonable to try again in November? We're moving to the US in February. I will travel back for frozen embryo transfer if necessary.

My body feels good right now. I've been eating healthy (or at least healthier than normal), exercising, and staying off coffee and alcohol. Been taking loads of vitamins: CoQ10, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, omega 3 -- not sure if all this does any good. But what the hell? I'll try anything/everything. A friend suggested I go give an offering at this Buddhist temple known to help with fertility and I  (devout Jew) considered it!

Anyway, that's my intro. Thanks for reading. I hope I didn't misuse the ""standalone post"" feature. And thanks to all of you for sharing your info and stories.

269,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi there, I'm new to the community and hope this works as a stand alone post. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed and could really use some advice.

I just turned 36 and my husband is 34 (both straight, Cis folks). I've always wanted kids and I work with young children. It took my husband a minute to feel ready, but he was 100% onboard when I finally got my IUD removed in February. We were delighted to get pregnant right away and then devastated to lose that pregnancy at nine weeks. I went in for another ultrasound and found out that the heartbeat was much slower than it should be and was told to wait for the inevitable. My miscarriage happened on actual Mother's Day, which was almost funny but nothing about that shit was funny. Misery and heartbreak - you guys get it.  I know a lot of you have been trying a lot longer and have dealt with more - my love to you.

Because we got pregnant so quickly, I coped thru focusing on getting pregnant again. Maybe it would just happen right away again and everything would be fine this time and I could escape this bog of eternal sadness? Eh, eh? Oof. I've been charting (tho I'm not the best at taking my temperature at a consistent time every morning) and using ovulation strips.

It took months for my cycles to regulate after the loss - my luteal phase was short. It seemed like I was having implantation symptoms and my temp was staying up and then I'd get my period like 6 days early. One time it was 8 days early. There are so many reasons to get your period late but not many reasons to get your period early. I started to wonder if conception was happening followed by recurrent early loss - this is a thing that I've read about to books by accredited people but apparently it's a controversial idea.

I was taking Best Nest's Ready, Set, Go fertility prenatal and then switched to Conception by Eu Natural. Conception contains Vitex and you take it through the first trimester. It seemed like I was having a hormone problem (too little progesterone?) and I wanted something that was a little more of a corrective than a booster. I've been taking the Conception supplement for about three months and I've finally had two 28 day cycles so I feel like it's helping regulate in some way. I started my husband on Conception for dudes about a month ago. I also added fertility lubricant to the mix during my last cycle. I've also been doing somewhat weekly acupuncture at our local community acupuncture place.

I've felt really torn between going full tilt into the realm of medical infertility treatment vs. trying to chill and use OTC resources. As far as OTC resources, I've been looking at OvuSense (fertility monitor), Modern Fertility (at home fertility/hormone testing), Mosie (at-home alternative to IUI), getting panels run at Any Lab Test Now, etc. Money is tight and I have high-deductible insurance. Additionally, I haven't always had the best experience with doctors and I'm so worried about the money and the stress and the unknowns of this kind of ""treatment."" But I've decided that I want any help I can get and I'm going back to my OBGYN on Monday for an ovulation ultrasound. I'm also worried that I have an underlying condition that's effecting things that I don't know about.

I went back to my Dr. when I was having the short luteal phase issue (I'd been on Conception for about a month at that time) and she tested my progesterone and said it was normal and indicated ovulation. I miraculously really like my Dr. but she's not a very outside of the box kinda lady. She said the next step was to do the ovulation ultrasound and probably start taking Clomid or a similar drug to boost ovulation. I have a gut feeling that I need progesterone support (though hoping my supplement is helping my hormone production) and she said that she's be willing to prescribe it even though my level appeared normal, but warned that it was really expensive.  She said that if I'm worried about my hormones, she'd like to refer me to a reproductive endocrinologist (sounds good but so expensive).  She also said we could do a dye test to make sure my tubes were open and mentioned testing my husband.

I kind of thought that the fact that I'd gotten pregnant recently was a good indication that I was ovulating and my tubes were open, etc. and felt a little disappointed with this advice/plan (with the exception of testing my husband - I always think that this should be done early so the lady isn't the only one under the microscope). I also thought she might want to test my thyroid, etc. and look for any underlying conditions. I think she's willing to honor any requests I have for testing, etc. but I'm not counting on her to volunteer the ideas. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed and don't want to seem like a crazy person.

So I'm for humbly and gratefully asking for your advice and encouragment. What tests should I ask for/pursue? What do you think the best next steps are? Have you had any good experiences with OTC things that I should ask my Dr. about?

As far as other info about me, I'm overweight (I have a heavy bone structure and have always been heavier) but I go to the gym and eat pretty healthily. I'm trying to double down on getting healthier but never appreciate body shaming (that's some of my baggage with Dr.'s).  I've had a lot of family stress that's messed with my system in the last few years. My Mom had several miscarriages (and 3 healthy, fullterm babies) and both my mother and sister have thyroid issues. My sister's thyroid issues began after the birth of her son. All of the women in my family deal with autoimmune issues but it's hard to nail down exactly what it is. I don't believe I have PCOS and when I was pregnant, the doctors didn't notice anything unusual about my anatomy during the 3 transvaginal ultrasounds of my reproductive system.

I really can't thank you enough for reading this. It really helps me feel a lot less alone to get this all out.

I was told i would have to have laparoscopic surgery  and remove at least the left tube because it is not repairable. I was told i would have to be ok with him removing both tubes before i could do the surgery, because from a fertility standpoint i could still potentially do IVF if both tubes were removed. This is something that has been really hard to wrap my head around and I wonder if i should get another opinion. The pain is not fun but I dont want to remove BOTH tubes if only one needs to be removed just for the sake of &quot;eliminating pain&quot; I could use some help.</p>

Also having to pee but just a little. </p>\n\n<p>-in May my wife did have a bacterial UTI and we were having sex often in light of trying naturally before IVF</p>\n\n<p>-feeling like it’s a little hard but not too hard to finish a pee (3 mths but again so mild hard to tell)</p>\n\n<p>We ruined the Bach of donor eggs and now are freezing other eggs. I’m on antibiotics (Ciproflaxacin and Azithromycin) to try to fight the unknown bacteria. </p>\n\n<p>My hypothesis from Dr Google is that I likely have one chronic prostatitis and I got it from E. coli via a UTI.

We have been trying for a few years and have already done 4 cycles of IVF without success. It appears one major blocker now is the uterine wall is not thick enough, after an operation. Therefore, we have been looking into surrogacy.

We currently have 1 frozen day 3 embryo and 3 frozen fertilised eggs. After speaking with the surrogacy agency, they said it is recommended to do PGD testing but that it is not required.

We did some research and it seems this testing is done after day 3, by extracting a cell from the embryo. We would assume this means our embryos/eggs would need to be thawed, left to grow, tested, and then re-frozen.

Logically, we would think this caries a risk. Can anybody shed any light on that? We did find one study that said it can negatively affect future outcomes but our local doctor does not know anything about this type of testing because it is illegal in our country.

It would be good to know that our embryos/eggs are of good enough quality to go through with surrogacy but since we only have 4 (hopefully, we will get more in the future), we are also worried about any damage or risk to the only embryos/eggs we have.

My husband and I have been seen by a clinic here in Toronto. After several tests it was determined that my husband has low sperm count and other issues with sperm quality. I checked out fine after several tests and the fact I got pregnant successfully in my early 20s they have been primarily focused on treating my husband.  Due to other life events (work relocations - 2 sick parents) we decided to let 2 years run it course and see what happens (I have used ovulation kits etc) ........ here I am 2+ years later with no luck. 

We are going to go back to Toronto West Fertility but my husband says he has a 'bad feeling' about them (I know, I know... it's probably just his anxiety) and wanted to get a second opinion. When we started digging deeper into exploring other clinics (New Life is on our list - as well as TRIO both in the Toronto area) my husband suggested the possibility about going to the US. On a recent business trip to the US he met a colleague who mentioned that he had gone to the US for fertility treatments after having some lukewarm experiences in the Toronto area as well (no idea the specific details). So far, the clinic we dealt with plan of action was to put my husband on meds for 3 months and then based on that move on to IUI/IVF (IVF being more then likely). 

I have reached out to a few clinics that I found online that would work for us logistically (as there is a possibility I may go with my husband to the US for 5 months in the New Year and the fact my job as a flight attendant allows me access to airfare). From my preliminary research and from the information my husband has gathered there are screening tests for birth defects/abnormalities, 'bring home a baby guarantees', gender selection (pls don’t judge me- can expand on this after), transparent data regarding the clinic's success rates that are not available in Canada. I realize that these clinics essentially operate as a business and therefore I want to make sure I'm not falling for a sales technique. 

I have a few phone consultations set up this week and I'm completely in the dark about this.
