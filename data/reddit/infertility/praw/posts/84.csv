Relevant info from previous post: Clinic sent my husband for a surgical sperm retrieval *before* they did a mandatory test that ended up rendering the sample unusable and setting us up for a 12 month delay. As a result, we were unsure whether we wanted to continue to work with them.

--------------------------------------------------
Update from today:

My husband and I decided to go in first thing in the morning (about 2 hours before my egg retrieval) with the intent of sitting down with the office manager and basically reading the riot act. If they made a reasonable effort to make things right, we would go through with the procedure. If not, we would walk.

The cynic in me was expecting to fight with them and lose, but I was actually pleasantly surprised with how the office manager handled it. I explained what was going on, and she seemed pretty concerned about the situation. She took down the information we had and went to speak to the doctor. He then sat down with us and said he thinks we will be able to prove my husband's sample is usable and continue on as before. Up until now we had been told that wouldn't be possible, but he thinks the test results that got us into this were inaccurate and once we do more testing to prove that, he can overrule the 12-month delay and make sure we're able to use the existing sample soon (thus avoiding another expensive and painful surgery for my husband.)

So, depending on the results of the additional tests they're doing now, it's still up in the air as to whether this will play out in our favor. But, they are optimistic, and frankly I'm just relieved to know that it's even a possibility. 

Ultimately, after these discussions and the promising news, I decided to go through with the retrieval and got 10 eggs. We should find out the test results for my husband's side within a few weeks, and then I guess we'll go from there.

A big thanks to everyone here for their support and advice, it really helps to feel like I'm not going crazy or going through this alone.

I&#39;m sad and scared and I haven&#39;t told him yet. My doctor wants to refer him to a urologist. What would a urologist do for motility? Has anyone seen motility improve? Does this basically mean we are looking at IUI or IVF?</p>

So my basically husband and I have been trying to conceive for 15 months. At first it was fun and the unexpected was exciting. months went by with nothing - then we went for labs, April 2019.  My thyroid stimulating hormone was with in normal range but a little high for conceiving so doc started me on Synthriod 50mcg and I have been right where they want me since about may. Sperm analysis came back less than stellar. low motility at 30% and 1% morphology. diagnosed with male factor. So IUI was suggested- We were ready to start moving forward with treatment and happy to have some answers. 

August rolls around and my reproductive endocrinologist said before we move forward that he wants me checked out by a hematologist because my white blood cells have been low consistently over the last 6 months. 2,800 - 3,000 or so. Over 3 different lab draws. normal range is 4,500 -10,000 per microliter. So I met with a Hematologist doc every single Friday in august, got tons of labs and ultimately a bone marrow biopsy to be 100% that nothing was wrong. Everything came back normal he stated that currently his assessment was that my low white blood cell count was benign and he would clear me for fertility treatments, but continue to monitor every 4-6 months. YAY!

So September came and I went in for my initial ultrasound to make sure there were not any cysts that would prevent moving forward with fertility treatments and medications. Well - guess what - yup... big ole cyst on my right ovary measuring about 24x27mm or about 2.5cm. It was also there the next cycle in the beginning of October. I was put on birth control in hopes that the cyst would dissipate by suppressing my own hormones. I was made very clear that the birth control itself does not ""shrink"" the cyst. 

So- I went in today for my 3rd ultrasound in hopes that it would be gone and we could move forward with treatment. Thats a big fat no. It is still there-  it has not gotten and bigger or smaller. For all we know I could have had this for a decade. They think possibly it could be part of the issue with us being unsuccessful in conceiving naturally, but its hard to say. Either way the doc laid out my options:

1. do nothing and wait. continue to get monthly ultrasounds to monitor cyst
2. continue on hormonal birth control (definitely can't get pregnant- but it isn't happening naturally anyways)
3. Surgery to remove the cyst and then proceed with fertility treatment after recovery period (\*pending everything goes according to plan)

A couple things about this situation are making me very uneasy. I do feel as though surgery is inevitable- maybe I should just get it done sooner rather than later. I work as a nurse in PACU - post anesthesia care unit. I take care of patients like this on a daily basis so I know what to expect (its a double edged sword). All the people taking care of me I see everyday and work side by side with. So I know that I am in good hands  - but I am also very aware of the complications that can arise from surgery.

23,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello all,

Due to a massive amount of inexcusable fuck ups in the last week and a half of working with my fertility clinic, I'm seriously considering cancelling my egg retrieval tomorrow. I have at least 10-15 large, viable ""targets"", but I do not trust them to perform the procedure correctly. 

Does anyone know if I need medical treatment in order to opt out of this safely? Will I simply ovulate or reabsorb them? (I've had a hysterectomy so there's no pregnancy risk).

24,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I’m currently going thru my 4th loss. 

Background info:

1st loss- saw heartbeat at 6w2d but was bleeding from an SCH. Scan the next week showed no growth past 6w3d. 

2nd loss- nothing grew past a yolk sac, but the gestational sac kept growing as normal. Had the most pregnancy symptoms here but also had an SCH/bleeding. 

Referred to an RE. Got initial testing including saline sono and RPL bloodwork/karyotyping. Bloodwork came back normal, saline sono showed two small (2cm) intramural fibroids and an arcuate uterus. RE said not to even worry about either as he doesn’t believe they contributed. Gave us green light to try again. 

3rd loss- fetal pole seen at 5w5d, but there was an SCH starting to detach the placenta. Next scan showed no growth. Used progesterone suppositories but had to stop when I was bleeding heavily. Wasn’t given an alternative. Progesterone was low from beginning. 

Original RE left Kaiser, so I started seeing a new RE. She questioned the arcuate uterus and ordered an MRI and HSG. MRI confirmed slightly arcuate uterus, while HSG confirmed anteverted position and one blocked tube. Because her original thought was that I had a bicornuate uterus and I actually did not, now she is blaming the intramural fibroids. I decided to get another opinion. So the next RE said she doesn’t think my tube is actually blocked, but that a fibroid is pushing against that area (since two of the pregnancies I got pregnant from the “blocked” side). She’s also thinking fibroids might be a culprit, even though science doesn’t support it due to size and location. We also did dna sperm frag on my husband. It showed 20% dna frag. I’ve read online that is borderline, yet my doctor said they only consider it at 30% and higher. 

4th loss- was completely spontaneous and a surprise. Progesterone test showed normal levels at beginning so I did not supplement. 6 weeks on the dot I started bleeding, SCH was found that was larger than the sac but normal growth was seen at this point. Was given PIO injections. Bleeding stopped but next week showed everything was gone and just clotting in the uterus. Being told next time I should start PIO during ovulation. 

I cannot keep doing the same thing expecting different results. Since I miscarried each time without intervention, no POC testing was done. We don’t know if it’s a viability issue causing the inevitable clotting, or if it is my body. My options at this point are to try IVF with PGT to try to rule out embryo viability issues, possibly surgery to remove the fibroids but I keep being told “I’d hate for you to have the surgery and then still miscarry afterwards”, or maybe I do need to start PIO earlier? If you’ve read this far, you’re a saint and I really appreciate your advice and input. I’m thinking of requesting a hysterscopy to get a picture of what’s going on in the uterus and if fibroids are being missed or pushing against the lining.

Hi all wonder if anyone had a similar issue ...I am 41 PCOS and male factor. I had 3 fresh cycles using our own embryos all resulted in miscarriages.

I moved on to donor embryos, first cycle two embryos, negative. Most recent cycle one embryo, no pregnancy.

They have some issues with organisation - we wouldn’t be seen until 45 minutes after our appointments etc. Sometimes they’d give us ultrasound appointment dates with no times, and then call us one day before the date to tell us what the time would be.

We just dealt with it as best we could, but it’s been difficult getting time off work for both of us with such short notice.

We had two ultrasounds and the doctor told us that our trigger would be on “Monday”, and the IUI would be on “Wednesday”. By this point we were pretty fed up with their lack of scheduling (including some other mishaps with billing) that when Monday rolled around and we hadn’t heard from them, we just decided to do the trigger at 9am.

We got a call at 4pm telling us that the trigger should be at 9:45pm and that our appointment on Wednesday is at 1:45pm. We forgot to tell them that we did the trigger early. Since it was already close of business, we weren’t able to call them back.

Their schedule would place our IUI at roughly 40 hours after when we were *supposed* to trigger which seems okay to me, but since we did it extremely early it’s going to be around 53 hours after we *actually* did the trigger.

Our main fertility issue is that my wife (36, cis F) has to use my (27, trans F) frozen sperm from pre transition as I no longer have testicles.

I know the answer is to just call them, but its a public holiday and they’re closed. Should I call them first thing in the morning and just cancel?

To say I’m devastated is an understatement, but as I wait for my dr to call, I was wondering if anyone had any insight into next steps in their infertility journey.

I’m planning to naturally miscarry but after that I’m not really sure what to do at this point.  We only had two embryos make it to freeze in our most recent retrieval (one of which was the blighted ovum). Because we had so few and I’m under 35 we initially opted not to do PGS testing. 

I’m now wondering if it is worthwhile to PGS test our remaining embryo or go through another retrieval for banking then send all embryos to be PGS tested at that time? We would love to be able to have two children, so either way I think I will need to do another retrieval and younger eggs seem like a better plan to me logically but I’m not sure if it matters.

Any advice or experience welcome.

ETA: in case anyone looks this up in the future, I wanted to provide my experience.

7 days after stopping my progesterone and estrogen I began cramping with some bleeding. The following day in the afternoon about 5 hours of intense cramping and massive bleeding occurred. I don’t mean to scare anybody, but this was MUCH more than just a heavy period.  My clinic allows collection of the POC at home so I collected what I passed in a specimen cup. I almost went to the hospital for fear of hemorrhaging because  I was honestly gushing blood for hours straight and feeling faint, but the bleeding started to slow by hour 5 and color began returning to my face.

I took my specimen cup to the clinic today and they took my blood so that they can send it to Natera for their Anora POC test. We should get the results in 2 weeks or so.

If this ever happens again, I will be opting for a d&c under hospital supervision.

<p>I’m planning to naturally miscarry but after that I’m not really sure what to do at this point.  We only had two embryos make it to freeze in our most recent retrieval (one of which was the blighted ovum). Because we had so few and I’m under 35 we initially opted not to do PGS testing. </p>

<p>I’m now wondering if it is worthwhile to PGS test our remaining embryo or go through another retrieval for banking then send all embryos to be PGS tested at that time? We would love to be able to have two children, so either way I think I will need to do another retrieval and younger eggs seem like a better plan to me logically but I’m not sure if it matters.</p>

<p>Any advice or experience welcome.</p>

<p>ETA: in case anyone looks this up in the future, I wanted to provide my experience.</p>

<p>7 days after stopping my progesterone and estrogen I began cramping with some bleeding. The following day in the afternoon about 5 hours of intense cramping and massive bleeding occurred. I don’t mean to scare anybody, but this was MUCH more than just a heavy period.  My clinic allows collection of the POC at home so I collected what I passed in a specimen cup. I almost went to the hospital for fear of hemorrhaging because  I was honestly gushing blood for hours straight and feeling faint, but the bleeding started to slow by hour 5 and color began returning to my face.</p>

<p>I took my specimen cup to the clinic today and they took my blood so that they can send it to Natera for their Anora POC test. We should get the results in 2 weeks or so.</p>

<p>If this ever happens again, I will be opting for a d&amp;c under hospital supervision.  I’m honestly just happy that I’m some sick twist of fate I knew I would be miscarrying and this wasn’t out of the blue because I’m not sure I would have handled it very well if it was out of the blue.</p>

From tests Friday:

My Thyroid is slightly high (3.7), will be going on meds for the next month to bring it back to normal.

My lining looks good (don't know the measurements), no cysts or anything on the ovaries.

I will be starting Letrozole for CD 3(today)-7 followed by a trigger shot on CD10.

My tubes are clear.

Ovulating normally.

61,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I want to share my story so far to help others who might be dealing with (knowingly or unknowingly) MFI + high sperm DNA fragmentation and, in our case possibly as a result of that, directly cleaving embryos.  It seems DNA fragmentation is a relatively new consideration in infertility with so many people suggesting testing for the male partner for this after failed cycles, I thought you would appreciate hearing our story since we have used 4 different sperm selection methods (normal density gradient sorting + ICSI, frequent ejaculation + normal density gradient sorting + ICSI, ZyMot sorting + ICSI, and TESE + ICSI).  Also, searching this subreddit I don't see anything about direct cleavage, so since this has become such a huge part of our story I thought I would share in hopes that maybe others could get answers have another possible explanation avenue to search for ""answers"" for their failed cycles, too.   I will also post this on r/maleinfertility and r/dnafragmentation.

In case you don't want to read this whole post but are unfamiliar with direct cleavage of embryos: this is something that is only detectable when embryos are under an EmbryoScope video camera and is when embryos split abnormally.  Normal cells of an embryo divide from 1 to 2 cells and that process usually takes 10-12 hours between divisions, but directly cleaving embryos might start out dividing from 1 to 2 cells but then they divide quickly to 3, 4, or even in our case 5 cells in less than 5 hours.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132229/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132229/)

I'll try to summarize as best as I can, but it's been a long journey (as I'm sure you all relate to), so this will be fairly long.  Also, TW: Previous success and two chemical pregnancies mentioned.

Started trying July 2016, husband diagnosed with low concentration (10 mil/mL), motility(\~%20-25), morphology (0%), and a varicocele by a urologist specializing in infertility in February 2017.  Varicocele surgery May 2017 + him taking clomid for a few months (FSH a little low at 1.1) had essentially no affect on SA parameters, though he did have his sperm concentration about triple (10 to 30 mil/mL) and his morphology improve (0 to 3%) within the first month or two of supplements (FertileAid, etc.).  Also SAs started noting ""agglutination"" or ""immature sperm cells"" in the SA samples which is still  a mystery to us.  Tried 2 IUIs that failed July and August of 2017.  Of note is that the post-wash SA figures are supposed to show very high motility (like 80-90% is my understanding) since the most motile sperm are supposed to be selected into the sample, but our post-wash numbers were pretty horrible and showed low motility.  Total motile first time was around 10 million, which was decent, but then next IUI it dropped to 3 or 4 million and that's when we knew we were headed for IVF.  We thought this weird post-wash drop off in motility had something to do with the agglutination/immature sperm cells mentioned in the SAs, but neither our RE nor our reproductive urologist had answers for why this was and we still don't know.  On to IVF.

With a high AMH around 8, I was on a low dose antagonist protocol with dual trigger.  125 Follistim for a few days until it was lowered to 100, and Menopur 75 throughout: stimmed for 8 days.  Added Ganirelix last 4 days and did a dual trigger with Lupron plus I think 2000 units HcG.  Only 18 follicles looked like they were big enough to hold mature eggs on day of trigger, but 39 eggs were retrieved with 31 mature.  We naively thought IVF was our silver bullet that would overcome all our MFI problems and we didn't want to have too many embryos because we probably only wanted 2 or possibly 3 kids, so we did limited fertilization of 10 eggs and froze the remaining 21.  We did ICSI, of course, but nothing else (and embryos were not in the EmbryoScope, which they usually reserve for special cases).  We expected/hoped to get 4-5 frozen blasts to complete our family...we were about to be heart-broken.  Here are our hunger game stats from that October 2017 round:

Day 1: 8 of 10 fertilized

Day 3: one 5-cell (""poor""), six 6-cell with moderate 10-25% fragmentation (""fair""), one 8-cell with moderate fragmentation (""fair"").  They told us to expect 2-3 blasts and I was convinced they were wrong and we'd still get 4-5...

Day 5: All of them had arrested except a morula and another trying to make a blast but very poor quality and didn't look like either would make it: they told us we would be left with nothing to freeze.  (I found out the next day we had a very poor quality blast on day 6 and they discarded it because they didn't think it'd survive the freeze...that was hard to hear and honestly bothered me a little from a pro-life mindset.)

Cue a month of maybe the darkest depressions of my life.  Next month luckily we could do another fertilization round with transfer since I had frozen eggs.  We were going to try PICSI selection, try putting our embryos in the EmbryoScope, and try the calcium ionophor culture medium, and I read a few articles about frequent ejaculations leading up to fertilization yielding fresher sperm with lower DNA fragmentation so decided to try that on our own.  We didn't know if he had a DNA fragmentation issue yet, but we ordered the test and assumed he probably did so we had sex every other day the week leading up to fertilization and had only 1.5 days abstinence before collection.  Well, we got horrible news about his sperm that round: the prewash count was only like 300,000 and post wash count was like 30,000, so they didn't have enough to even use PICSI (I didn't realize there was a minimum requirement).  That means his count was like 300 times lower than normal: what the?!!  I guess the frequent ejaculations ruined his count.  They used ICSI on 9 thawed eggs, and here are our hunger games results that round.  We had already planned on a day 3 transfer of 2 embryos based on our last cycle's epic failure.

Day 1: All 9 fertilized

Day 3: six of the nine embryos arrested already (!), and the only three living embryos were 5-cell with significant fragmentation.  They gave us a picture of 2 horrible-looking 5-cell embryos and I burst out crying saying there was no point even doing the transfer really based on those crappy-looking embryos.  They said we could put in the only other surviving embryo, too, which I agreed to though still with zero hope.  For some reason the one they added looked better than the other two, though presumably they had chosen the 2 that looked best originally.  We were told nothing about the division of our embryos even though they were in the EmbryoScope (more about that later).  We had success with a singleton that cycle.

December 2017 we got our DNA fragmentation test results back and it said my husband had about 42% fragmentation, though most of the fragmentation was severe rather than mild, which we were told is actually better since severely fragmented sperm would likely lead to embryo arrest whereas mild fragmentation could lead to miscarriage, possible genetic issues, etc.

Fast forward to late July 2019, thawed 6 eggs and used ZyMot sorting then ICSI.  I don't think ZyMot had come out back in 2017 yet, and I was glad to hear our RE actually suggest this before I could even bring it up myself based on my research.  We were excited for this option because ZyMot sorting did not require traditional density-gradient washing beforehand: the raw sample is placed in the ZyMot device directly.  We again also used the EmbryoScope and calcium ionophor culture medium, and we planned on a day 3 transfer of 2 embryos again.  Here are the stats:

Day 1: 5 of 6 fertilized normally

Day 3: We we given 3 embryos to transfer because they were pretty bad: transferred two 6-cell ""fair quality""/""BB"" (10-25% fragmentation) embryos and an 8-cell ""poor quality""/""CC"" (\~50% fragmentation) embryo.  I can't remember the grading of the other two embryos, but they didn't make it to freeze.  Worst news of all, though was being told that all of our embryos ""directly cleaved"" from 1 to 5 cells.  Even more shocking was that the embryologist said even with direct cleavage embryos it's usually 1 to 3 cells and in those cases the implantation chance is less than 1% and this could be related to genetic abnormalities.  I think I found the source of this research ( [https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(12)01888-2/fulltext](https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(12)01888-2/fulltext)), and further independent research showed me that 1 to 5 cell direct cleavage was pretty much unheard of, and even 1 to 3 cleavage was nearly a hopeless cause with only one or two articles mentioning a live birth from these conditions.  My RE kept mentioning that most people don't have their embryos under an EmbryoScope to see the cleavage patterns, but I still knew we were a huge anomaly, especially for ALL of our embryos to behave this way!  We had the embryologist look back at our November 2017 successful cycle to see the division behavior then, expecting her to see normal division in at least that one embryo, but low and behold some of the arresting embryos divided 1 to 2, but all 3 of the transferred embryos also divided 1 to 5 cells like these had!  Apparently we are a very rare case of having a live birth with a direct cleaving embryo.  Many mixed thoughts and emotions at that point, but very sick of having so many random horrible things go wrong with out infertility that seemed to not happen to any others even withing the infertility community.  That cycle was a very low chemical: 8.6 beta 10dp3dt and 6 beta 11dp3dt.  We weren't sure what to think of that: we were a little surprised that something even made it to blast but that didn't change the outcome.

Late August 2019 thawed our last 6 eggs and husband had TESE surgery, which was really our last resort to see any improvement.  Again used ICSI (of course), calcium ionophor, and EmbryoScope.  TESE was done the day of egg thaw so we could use a fresh sample.  TESE seemed successful: got 5 frozen vials in addition to the fresh sperm used.  Embryologist said they used a caffeine-type substance to make the sperm more motile (they were mostly just twitching, which I think/thought was all that was expected of TESE sperm) to choose the best.  Since then I've been told by another embryologist that they don't always use the caffeine-type substance and that my husband's sample actually had low concentration and motility even for TESE sperm, though she said that could be due to the urologist extracting sperm from farther back in the testicles where they would be expected to be quite immotile like this?  Here's the hunger games data:

Day 1: 6 of 6 fertilize

Day 3: 8AA (never had a ""perfectly"" graded day 3 before!), 8BB, 6BC, 6CB, 5-cell, multi-fragmented/ungraded embryo (first letter is for fragmentation, second for cell symmetry).  Finally got some great news: our 8AA embryo had divided normally, our first normally-dividing embryo we think (first round not in EmbryoScope)!  The 8BB directly cleaved 1 to 3 but divided normally from there, and the others not only went 1 to 5 cell but then alternated between forward and reverse cleaving (cell number would increase then decrease then increase, etc.)...so the bad ones got an even worse division report than before (though I think the previous rounds this likely happened, too, and we just weren't told or didn't remember it).  We transferred the 8AA and 8BB.

Day 6: Surprisingly were told our 6BC embryos from day 3 had made an expanded blast but was poor quality in ICM and trophectoderm.  They would update me tomorrow, but they assumed it wouldn't make it.  I was pleasantly surprised one of our remaining embryos had even gotten that far honestly.

Day 7: Even more shockingly, got a call that the blast that was a 4CC had upgraded to a 6BB and was frozen!  Our very first frozen embryo!

That cycle ended in another low, but slightly higher than last time, chemical.  11dp3dt beta was 22, 14dp3dt beta was 8.

My RE thought our two chemicals were just an embryo issue (though the second chemical was with a normally-dividing highest rated day 3 embryo, so that makes me a little nervous), but to be sure I got an RPL blood test on Halloween (6 weeks after roughly negative beta) and my husband and I both got the karyotyping test, results not in yet obviously.  We didn't want to transfer that embryo alone with it being a day 7 with abnormal division, so I did almost 3 weeks of BC leading up to another stim cycle.  I still thought our issue was pretty much 100% MFI, but our RE said she's always thought there was some egg component, too (maybe because of high AFC/AMH/egg yield?), and she wanted to try a ""mini-IVF"" stim cycle to aim and get only 10-12 follicles.  I was skeptical at first because I thought it was a sperm issue and a numbers game: I wasn't sure if the one normally-dividing embryo was a fluke or indicative of TESE helping overcome our weird MFI/embryo division issue, but I thought we'd need as many eggs as possible to have a shot at more normally-dividing embryos and a shot at getting more frozen blasts.  We went with her recommendation after all, especially since the protocol was not much different than our first stim cycle: first day of ""stims"" was just 2 clomid tablets which was taken for those first 5 nights.  2nd day and onward of stims we did 100 Follistim and 75 Menopur, adding in Ganirelix last few days, and doing a dual trigger again with Lupron and 2000 units (I think) of HcG.  We also used HGH during stims, split up 3 vials into 4 injections given on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 of stims.  We did 8 days of stim shots just like 2017, though technically clomid day counted as stim day 1.  We were nervous to hear the hunger game results, both because we really didn't have any other significant trick up our sleeve for hope of improvement after this, and because last time we tried growing all our embryos out to blasts in the lab we got the call that none of them were going to make it.  We got 21 eggs and turns out 15 were mature.  Had there been 17 or more mature eggs we instructed them to only fertilize 12 and freeze the rest to try to prevent leftover embryos.

Day 1: 14 of 15 fertilized

Day 3: 4 good, 5 fair, 5 poor with the following breakdown.  Good: 10AA, 8BA, 7AA, 10BA.  Fair: 9BB, 6BB, 6BB, 6CB, 6BC.  Poor: 5-cell, 5-cell, 5-cell, 8CC, 6CC.  Got some amazing news (amazing for us, probably would be horrible news for most people) about the cleavage: 4 of them (10AA, 8BA, 7AA, 6BB) cleaved normally!!!  The rest went 1 to 2 to 5 very quickly (so 1 to 5 effectively, same as before) and again experienced alternating forward then reverse cleavage after that.  We were finally hopeful that this cycle wouldn't be a total failure again!

Day 6: Best news possible!  All 4 normally-dividing embryos not only made it to blast (on day 6...3 were early blasts and one was a morula on day 5 check), but they were all good quality blasts: 5AA, 5AA, 5AB, 5BA!!!  They said one of the abnormally-dividing embryos made a blast, but it was such poor quality that they didn't freeze it.  Again, that bothers me ethically a bit, but I get it.

So it's possible the slightly lower stim dosage + Clomid or the HGH did improve my egg quality some (though I was also 2 years older: 32 instead of 30), but I'm convinced that it's the TESE that was our silver bullet.  We went from having 36 of 37 of our fertilized abnormally-dividing embryos die to having 5 of 5 of our normally embryos make blasts, 4 we know are good quality.

&#x200B;

Here's my advice as a takeaway to others who have had a failed cycle especially (or maybe for those who know you can only afford one round of IVF):

1) Ask your RE if you can use the ZyMot device for sorting (it was free for us!, I think a few hundred dollars normally and you can order it online I think:  [https://us.ivfstore.com/collections/zymot](https://us.ivfstore.com/collections/zymot)) in case you have a DNA frag issue (which is possible even with a normal SA), and if you'd be able to afford TESE if the DNA frag results were bad enough consider getting the DNA frag testing done to see if TESE could help you.  (I think the info on r/dnafragmentation says if your fragmentation level is 15-30% ZyMot is recommended and above 30% TESE is recommended).

2) Ask to have your embryos put in the EmbryoScope if there is one available at your lab.  Ask your embryologist questions about your embryos' cell division: our first round in the scope they didn't even mention the direct cleavage!  From my research, they still don't know if it's for sure indicative of an egg or sperm issue for direct cleavage (first article I linked has some discussion on this toward the end), but I strongly suspect in our case it was a male factor issue that was overcome in at least some of our sperm using TESE.

&#x200B;

TLDR: We have significant MFI with 42% DNA fragmentation and found out by using the embryoscope that all our embryos were dividing abnormally (""direct cleavage"").  This problem was finally overcome by using TESE sperm which resulted in 4 good-quality day 6 blasts from 4 normally-dividing embryos (whereas previously pretty much all our embryos were fair quality on day 3 then didn't make blasts or made extremely poor quality blasts).  Consider ZyMot or TESE if you suspect or test positive for high sperm DNA fragmentation, and try watching cell division in the EmbryoScope to see if this problem is happening to you if you're getting failed cycles.",t2_57c71rv,False,,0,False,Sperm DNA Fragmentation and Directly Cleaving Embryos: Finally Found Blast Improvement!,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_drb8lr,False,dark,0.98,,public,40,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},TW: Mention of Children,False,40,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1572864127.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I want to share my story so far to help others who might be dealing with (knowingly or unknowingly) MFI + high sperm DNA fragmentation and, in our case possibly as a result of that, directly cleaving embryos.

I think I found the source of this research ( <a href=""https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(12"">https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(12)01888-2/fulltext</a>01888-2/fulltext)), and further independent research showed me that 1 to 5 cell direct cleavage was pretty much unheard of, and even 1 to 3 cleavage was nearly a hopeless cause with only one or two articles mentioning a live birth from these conditions.  My RE kept mentioning that most people don&#39;t have their embryos under an EmbryoScope to see the cleavage patterns, but I still knew we were a huge anomaly, especially for ALL of our embryos to behave this way!  We had the embryologist look back at our November 2017 successful cycle to see the division behavior then, expecting her to see normal division in at least that one embryo, but low and behold some of the arresting embryos divided 1 to 2, but all 3 of the transferred embryos also divided 1 to 5 cells like these had!  Apparently we are a very rare case of having a live birth with a direct cleaving embryo.  Many mixed thoughts and emotions at that point, but very sick of having so many random horrible things go wrong with out infertility that seemed to not happen to any others even withing the infertility community.  That cycle was a very low chemical: 8.6 beta 10dp3dt and 6 beta 11dp3dt.  We weren&#39;t sure what to think of that: we were a little surprised that something even made it to blast but that didn&#39;t change the outcome.</p>

<p>Late August 2019 thawed our last 6 eggs and husband had TESE surgery, which was really our last resort to see any improvement.  Again used ICSI (of course), calcium ionophor, and EmbryoScope.  TESE was done the day of egg thaw so we could use a fresh sample.  TESE seemed successful: got 5 frozen vials in addition to the fresh sperm used.  Embryologist said they used a caffeine-type substance to make the sperm more motile (they were mostly just twitching, which I think/thought was all that was expected of TESE sperm) to choose the best.  Since then I&#39;ve been told by another embryologist that they don&#39;t always use the caffeine-type substance and that my husband&#39;s sample actually had low concentration and motility even for TESE sperm, though she said that could be due to the urologist extracting sperm from farther back in the testicles where they would be expected to be quite immotile like this?  Here&#39;s the hunger games data:</p>

<p>Day 1: 6 of 6 fertilize</p>

<p>Day 3: 8AA (never had a &quot;perfectly&quot; graded day 3 before!), 8BB, 6BC, 6CB, 5-cell, multi-fragmented/ungraded embryo (first letter is for fragmentation, second for cell symmetry).  Finally got some great news: our 8AA embryo had divided normally, our first normally-dividing embryo we think (first round not in EmbryoScope)!  The 8BB directly cleaved 1 to 3 but divided normally from there, and the others not only went 1 to 5 cell but then alternated between forward and reverse cleaving (cell number would increase then decrease then increase, etc.)...so the bad ones got an even worse division report than before (though I think the previous rounds this likely happened, too, and we just weren&#39;t told or didn&#39;t remember it).  We transferred the 8AA and 8BB.</p>

<p>Day 6: Surprisingly were told our 6BC embryos from day 3 had made an expanded blast but was poor quality in ICM and trophectoderm.  They would update me tomorrow, but they assumed it wouldn&#39;t make it.  I was pleasantly surprised one of our remaining embryos had even gotten that far honestly.</p>

<p>Day 7: Even more shockingly, got a call that the blast that was a 4CC had upgraded to a 6BB and was frozen!  Our very first frozen embryo!</p>

<p>That cycle ended in another low, but slightly higher than last time, chemical.  11dp3dt beta was 22, 14dp3dt beta was 8.</p>

<p>My RE thought our two chemicals were just an embryo issue (though the second chemical was with a normally-dividing highest rated day 3 embryo, so that makes me a little nervous), but to be sure I got an RPL blood test on Halloween (6 weeks after roughly negative beta) and my husband and I both got the karyotyping test, results not in yet obviously.  We didn&#39;t want to transfer that embryo alone with it being a day 7 with abnormal division, so I did almost 3 weeks of BC leading up to another stim cycle.  I still thought our issue was pretty much 100% MFI, but our RE said she&#39;s always thought there was some egg component, too (maybe because of high AFC/AMH/egg yield?), and she wanted to try a &quot;mini-IVF&quot; stim cycle to aim and get only 10-12 follicles.  I was skeptical at first because I thought it was a sperm issue and a numbers game: I wasn&#39;t sure if the one normally-dividing embryo was a fluke or indicative of TESE helping overcome our weird MFI/embryo division issue, but I thought we&#39;d need as many eggs as possible to have a shot at more normally-dividing embryos and a shot at getting more frozen blasts.  We went with her recommendation after all, especially since the protocol was not much different than our first stim cycle: first day of &quot;stims&quot; was just 2 clomid tablets which was taken for those first 5 nights.  2nd day and onward of stims we did 100 Follistim and 75 Menopur, adding in Ganirelix last few days, and doing a dual trigger again with Lupron and 2000 units (I think) of HcG.  We also used HGH during stims, split up 3 vials into 4 injections given on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 of stims.  We did 8 days of stim shots just like 2017, though technically clomid day counted as stim day 1.  We were nervous to hear the hunger game results, both because we really didn&#39;t have any other significant trick up our sleeve for hope of improvement after this, and because last time we tried growing all our embryos out to blasts in the lab we got the call that none of them were going to make it.  We got 21 eggs and turns out 15 were mature.  Had there been 17 or more mature eggs we instructed them to only fertilize 12 and freeze the rest to try to prevent leftover embryos.</p>

<p>Day 1: 14 of 15 fertilized</p>

<p>Day 3: 4 good, 5 fair, 5 poor with the following breakdown.  Good: 10AA, 8BA, 7AA, 10BA.  Fair: 9BB, 6BB, 6BB, 6CB, 6BC.  Poor: 5-cell, 5-cell, 5-cell, 8CC, 6CC.  Got some amazing news (amazing for us, probably would be horrible news for most people) about the cleavage: 4 of them (10AA, 8BA, 7AA, 6BB) cleaved normally!!!  The rest went 1 to 2 to 5 very quickly (so 1 to 5 effectively, same as before) and again experienced alternating forward then reverse cleavage after that.  We were finally hopeful that this cycle wouldn&#39;t be a total failure again!</p>

<p>Day 6: Best news possible!  All 4 normally-dividing embryos not only made it to blast (on day 6...3 were early blasts and one was a morula on day 5 check), but they were all good quality blasts: 5AA, 5AA, 5AB, 5BA!!!  They said one of the abnormally-dividing embryos made a blast, but it was such poor quality that they didn&#39;t freeze it.  Again, that bothers me ethically a bit, but I get it.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s possible the slightly lower stim dosage + Clomid or the HGH did improve my egg quality some (though I was also 2 years older: 32 instead of 30), but I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s the TESE that was our silver bullet.  We went from having 36 of 37 of our fertilized abnormally-dividing embryos die to having 5 of 5 of our normally embryos make blasts, 4 we know are good quality.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my advice as a takeaway to others who have had a failed cycle especially (or maybe for those who know you can only afford one round of IVF):</p>

<p>1) Ask your RE if you can use the ZyMot device for sorting (it was free for us!, I think a few hundred dollars normally and you can order it online I think:  <a href=""https://us.ivfstore.com/collections/zymot"">https://us.ivfstore.com/collections/zymot</a>) in case you have a DNA frag issue (which is possible even with a normal SA), and if you&#39;d be able to afford TESE if the DNA frag results were bad enough consider getting the DNA frag testing done to see if TESE could help you.  (I think the info on <a href=""/r/dnafragmentation"">r/dnafragmentation</a> says if your fragmentation level is 15-30% ZyMot is recommended and above 30% TESE is recommended).</p>

<p>2) Ask to have your embryos put in the EmbryoScope if there is one available at your lab.  Ask your embryologist questions about your embryos&#39; cell division: our first round in the scope they didn&#39;t even mention the direct cleavage!  From my research, they still don&#39;t know if it&#39;s for sure indicative of an egg or sperm issue for direct cleavage (first article I linked has some discussion on this toward the end), but I strongly suspect in our case it was a male factor issue that was overcome in at least some of our sperm using TESE.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>TLDR: We have significant MFI with 42% DNA fragmentation and found out by using the embryoscope that all our embryos were dividing abnormally (&quot;direct cleavage&quot;).  This problem was finally overcome by using TESE sperm which resulted in 4 good-quality day 6 blasts from 4 normally-dividing embryos (whereas previously pretty much all our embryos were fair quality on day 3 then didn&#39;t make blasts or made extremely poor quality blasts).  Consider ZyMot or TESE if you suspect or test positive for high sperm DNA fragmentation, and try watching cell division in the EmbryoScope to see if this problem is happening to you if you&#39;re getting failed cycles.</p>

95,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Long time lurker, first time poster (and first time posting on Reddit). Sorry if I mess up any conventions.

Just completed our first round of IVF. We were thrilled to get 12 eggs at my ER yesterday (we were told to expect around 6). Then the call this morning...despite 10 of the eggs being mature, ZERO fertilized with ICSI. We are just gutted. Has anyone had a similar experience? The doctor was pretty surprised and thinks it’s a sperm issue. We’re meeting with him next week. Where do we go from here? 

Not to mention I still feel crummy from ER. I gained 6 lbs. during the process so my clothes don’t fit, and we are paying out of pocket (goodbye $20k :-/). Naively, I expected any result but this.

Me: Age 35, DOR (AMH=.5-.7), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Partner: Only has 2 million sperm count, plus borderline on every other measure, most likely from previous vasectomy (reversal obviously didn’t work as well as hoped).

Any ideas or encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I cannot adequately express my gratitude for everyone who has taken the time to respond with suggestions and support. I am so grateful and your kindness has given me a little more faith in humanity. I will post an update after my appointment on Wednesday (11/6)  for anyone who is interested.

EDIT/UPDATE: Detailed update on link below. They think it’s the sperm because the sample was much worse than previous SAs (went from multiple samples with around 2 million/47% motility to .6 million/0% motility). My eggs were of moderate quality - not amazing, not poor - but  standard for my age and condition.

Sorry if I mess up any conventions.</p>

<p>Just completed our first round of IVF. We were thrilled to get 12 eggs at my ER yesterday (we were told to expect around 6). Then the call this morning...despite 10 of the eggs being mature, ZERO fertilized with ICSI. We are just gutted. Has anyone had a similar experience? The doctor was pretty surprised and thinks it’s a sperm issue. We’re meeting with him next week. Where do we go from here? </p>

<p>Not to mention I still feel crummy from ER. I gained 6 lbs. during the process so my clothes don’t fit, and we are paying out of pocket (goodbye $20k :-/). Naively, I expected any result but this.</p>

<p>Me: Age 35, DOR (AMH=.5-.7), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Partner: Only has 2 million sperm count, plus borderline on every other measure, most likely from previous vasectomy (reversal obviously didn’t work as well as hoped).</p>

<p>Any ideas or encouragement would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>EDIT: I cannot adequately express my gratitude for everyone who has taken the time to respond with suggestions and support. I am so grateful and your kindness has given me a little more faith in humanity. I will post an update after my appointment on Wednesday (11/6)  for anyone who is interested.</p>

<p>EDIT/UPDATE: Detailed update on link below. They think it’s the sperm because the sample was much worse than previous SAs (went from multiple samples with around 2 million/47% motility to .6 million/0% motility). My eggs were of moderate quality - not amazing, not poor - but  standard for my age and condition. We’re going to try again in a month or two with backups: frozen samples with thaw tests, and if those don’t work, TESE and/or donor sperm.

I need advice on what you would do if you had thyroid labs like mine while pursuing IVF. I hope this is OK as a stand-alone. 

Background: 1 ER resulting in 10 untested embryos, Fresh transfer failed, FET had successful implantation that ended in miscarriage with a D&C. 

Now for the thyroid problem. I have never suspected for been tested for thyroid issues until going through infertility. In May 2018, my TSH was .7, which is in the normal range. As part of my regular blood work at the RE in August my TSH was 0.009, which is waaayyyy too low.  This was the week before my FET that resulted in a miscarriage. I brought this up at my WTF meeting and all of my thyroid levels were checked. With the recheck, my TSH was .25, which is low but not as bad, and the T3, T4, and antibodies were all normal. My RE would like me to see an endocrinologist (he also knows that I am anxious and so I think he is being cautious to keep me from extra worry), but my GP said that I only needed at recheck in 3 months.  My GP did get me set up with an endocrinologist at my request, but I couldn’t get in until December. Given that my GP really thinks my thyroid is ok, I am wondering if I should go ahead with a transfer before I see the endocrinologist?  What would you do?

Brief summary: We did IVF with ICSI, using a vial of frozen sperm retrieved via TESE. I’ve had two medicated  FETs that have failed to implant.

Embryologist said beside that, it looked the best (not exactly sure how that’s possible). All that to say, I don’t feel too optimistic about it. I have an appointment with my RE on Monday to discuss next steps. 

I’ve done some research on assisted hatching and see that the research doesn’t support increased live births, but that it is routine for some clinics. Just wondering if any of you have used assisted hatching or having any thoughts/advice.

I pretty much only post on /about infertility and most people who I have received DM or chats from have been in similar situations and have shared their stories or sympathy.

This morning I received a chat request and it said:

“I don’t get it with you infertiles. Why are you jealous of your friend having a kid? It’s not her fault you are infertile. Be happy with what you have.”

I was livid - suddenly we are told not to have feelings as we go through the grieving process? I went back and forth thinking what I would say then I realized that this person was just trolling and looking for a rise out of me. I accidentally accepted the chat request but then I immediately blocked the user. I looked at my and their post history and it doesn’t look like we posted anywhere on the same comment or subreddit before. Not sure what post they saw of mine, but I’ve been pretty open and vulnerable recently. They probably thought that I would be an easy target.

Anyways, I’ve been having a hard time coping with everything (Halloween doesn’t help, have been avoiding social media like the plague). This direct message sure put a sourness at the beginning of my day and I’m not sure I’ll be able to shake it off quickly.

Have others received messages like this? Why would someone send something like that? I’m still tempted to unblock them and have a conversation to understand the source of their feelings towards me/infertility.

I'm really struggling. I lost my baby Madeline almost 2 years ago.  My sister and I announced our first pregnancies around the same time. Everyone was so happy and we were happy. Well my baby girl got diagnosed with Trisomy 18 and we had to terminate at 17 weeks. It was so hard watching my sister go through her pregnancy and even attend her shower when the plan was, it was supposed to be both of our showers. I got through it and honestly thought I would be able to get pregnant again pretty quickly since that is what happened the first time. 

A year goes by, my sister announces she is pregnant with her second child and although I’m happy for her, it really stung. We have been trying for so long and nothing is happening. I also turn 40 in December so we feel this pressure to get pregnant as soon as we can. Then this past weekend, my brother sends me a text while I’m out at a Halloween party with friends having a blast. It is a picture of their kids holding up an ultrasound and saying they are now pregnant with their 3rd child! Honestly, it ruined my night. My brother and his wife are the last people who should be having another baby. They are both alcoholics, have separated like 4 times since they got married 2 years ago and my brother just got caught cheating on her 4 months ago! They have the most toxic marriage of anyone I know and they are already damaging their 2 kids they already have! It makes me so angry! Why not us? Why them?! Don’t we deserve to have at least one child?! We are good people and would be the best parents! 

So now my sister and sister in law are both pregnant. And I’m not. The only one in the family with no kids. And the frustrating thing is no one gets it. No one understands why I’m so upset. They all think I should be over Madeline’s death and happy for them. My sister said everyone deals with it and that I should stop worrying about everyone else. My mom tells me I should be happy for them. They don’t get it.  Now I have to go to family get togethers and listen to my sister and sister in law talk about their pregnancy and listen to everyone congratulate them while inside I fee like I’m dying inside. 

On Halloween, my sis in law and brother are having a Halloween party. They do it every year and we also celebrate my dad’s birthday. I’m expected to go but I know they are probably going to announce the pregnancy to friends and other family and I have to sit there and witness everyone fawn over her. And probably sit there and listen to my sister and sis in law talk about their pregnancy. I really don’t want to go but my whole family will probably be pissed and then think I’m a drama queen or something. I just don’t know what to do. And I would hate to miss my dad’s birthday. I just wish people would get it. I wish they would stop making insensitive remarks. My mom even told me that maybe I’m not meant to have kids and maybe I should start realizing that!!! That this is my life and now we won’t have the financial burden of having kids! Ugh. Sorry for the vent. I just feel so upset and alone in this journey. My husband is here but men are so different from women and although he is struggling too, he doesn’t understand some of my feelings toward it all.

157,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"(Please let me know if this isn’t allowed) I’d like to create a sub for those of us with POF/DOR or chemical menopause. It’s a complicated issue with long term issues after IVF and there is a huge discrepancy in treatment before/after IVF (or lack there of).  I have not been able to find a good online support community dedicated to our issues. This sub as well as a few others have been absolutely invaluable for me going through this but I’d like a space where we can talk about things related to HRT, life after IVF, and all the emotional and relationship issues that premature menopause specifically causes. It seems that this relatively common issue is massively under treated and under recognized and I am hoping we can help more women get support and better care. 

Is there any support for this idea? I’ve been sitting on it for a few weeks trying to come up with some info and intro posts but I think it might take me a few weeks to months to properly research and write up the posts I’d like to include about care guidelines. I also know nothing about how a sub runs and all that stuff. I reserved /r/POFLife with the intent of using that name.

It’s a complicated issue with long term issues after IVF and there is a huge discrepancy in treatment before/after IVF (or lack there of).  I have not been able to find a good online support community dedicated to our issues. This sub as well as a few others have been absolutely invaluable for me going through this but I’d like a space where we can talk about things related to HRT, life after IVF, and all the emotional and relationship issues that premature menopause specifically causes. It seems that this relatively common issue is massively under treated and under recognized and I am hoping we can help more women get support and better care. </p>

<p>Is there any support for this idea? I’ve been sitting on it for a few weeks trying to come up with some info and intro posts but I think it might take me a few weeks to months to properly research and write up the posts I’d like to include about care guidelines.

158,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Thanks to  everyone for your support. I posted on Saturday about how my egg retrieval ended up leaving me with one less ovary. I am writing this post with the hopes it may be added to our Wiki under complications. It seems many are not aware this is a possibility (1 in 1000). Also, there were many turns where we could have missed what was wrong, so I want to share my step-by-step experience. Fortunately, I followed my gut and advocated at every step, and already knew this could happen.

My 3rd egg retrieval was Friday at 1:00pm. Everything looked good, and I felt  normal at discharge, just like the first two ERs. I did have occasional sharp cramping (which might be normal). Fast forward an hour or so for lunch where I started to feel things were a bit off. I love food. I've had no problem with food after past ERs. This time, I just couldn't bring myself to finish eating. I felt .... bleh. But hey, to be expected after retrieval, right?

I lounged on the couch for about 1.5 hours then got up to use the restroom. As soon as I stood I felt a pressure and cramping and called my husband to help me make it the rest of the way. It was all I could do to just stand and walk.

I have a history of passing out in my adolescence, so I knew the signs as soon as they appeared as I was sitting on the toilet. Very hot, sweaty, nauseous, blurred vision. I laid down immediately. Still, I thought, maybe this is normal - I have a tendency to feel like this when I'm in pain or scared. However, the symptoms were stronger and longer lasting than usual for me. I instructed my husband to get cold wash cloths for my face and stomach and call 911 as I lay on the bathroom floor, barely clothed, trying to regulate my body temp.

By the time paramedics arrived I was feeling much better. They said I was still very pale (and my lips had gone close to blue). My blood pressure was still very low when I tried to sit up, so they took me out on a stretcher. So my first two symptoms that something wasn't right: passing out and low blood pressure.


As I waited in the ER, my pain continued to grow. Any sort of movement hurt. It felt like my insides were being squished. At the ER they performed an abdominal ultrasound to check for fluid. They also did a blood count, which came back low. Still, to this point, we figured all of this might just be chalked up to the retrieval and not something to worry about. So the next symptoms: fluid in the abdomen and increasing pressure upon movement, especially taking deep breaths. Apparently, the diaphragm has a bad reaction to blood, which is why I was in more pain when breathing deeply.


The ER doctor recommended a CT scan to check if the fluid was blood, or just from retrieval. We had a choice, he also said I could go home and see if things change. We opted for the CT. Good thing. The Dr. came by not long after to confirm the CT showed internal bleeding. They quickly got me on a blood transfusion and meds to temporarily stop the bleeding.


My OB was actually working that night. She told me best case scenario, they hit a blood vessel on my ovary and she could resolve it herself. Worst case, the bleeding was coming from somewhere else and another specialist would have to brought in. Fortunately, it was the ovary. They could have ""tied it off"" to stop the bleeding, but then with no blood supply the ovary would die, so she just took the whole thing out.

I hope this post doesn't scare anyone, but makes you more informed than you may have otherwise been. Trust your gut, follow a ""better safe than sorry"" mentality. If something doesn't seem right, hunt it down.


Also, I was told that the surgery and removal of my ovary should have no long term effects. That is, I could still continue with infertility treatment (retrievals and transfers) and carry a pregnancy without issue and have a vaginal delivery.",t2_251lsd45,False,,0,False,A lesser known retrieval risk,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_dobk7u,False,dark,0.99,,public,79,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,79,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1572310431.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Thanks to  everyone for your support.

We have been at this over 5 years...I keep getting new diagnoses every year (Yeah Me!!)..unexplained..then endometriosis..followed by PCOSish...followed by repeat implantation failure...positive Receptiva biopsy...Lap...Depot Lupron....then the last year...most devastating of all...repeat loss...Asherman’s from D&C and finally thought I was in the clear...did PGS testing and now this...

He recommended as did everyone else (even though they had never seen it) to cancel my FET...but he wanted to see if it resolved so I literally went through an entire cycle...twanding and blood draws only to cancel 1 hour before my transfer as he felt he had to listen to the consensus from the other RE’s...cue my mental breakdown...
On a side note I have to take Depot Lupron before any transfer cause it is the only thing that has gotten me implantation...well after doing it 3 times now!!! (The only one in my clinic who has done it that many) I have what seems like permanent neuropathy in my hands and my husband doesn’t want me to take it ever again.I don’t want to either but I feel like it is my only chance and we cannot afford surrogacy.
So we have 2 PGS tested embryos left....

-We can try Orlissa to suppress the endometriosis instead of Lupron although there is no data that I have found on it working for uterine receptivity as it is so new on the market

-We can do another Hysterscopy (just had one in May again) and cut my lining and get the cyst out but risk Asherman’s again and a permanent defect in my lining

Data nerd here.   I made a data visualization of the IVF hunger games for this subreddit's data!

I divided some of the analyses by PCOS status, since women with PCOS generally have more eggs in a cycle.

Usual caveats: since this dataset is not from a random sample, the results may not be representative of all women undergoing IVF.  The plots can be found here:

[https://janelange.shinyapps.io/IVF\_Hunger\_Games/](https://janelange.shinyapps.io/IVF_Hunger_Games/)

It takes a little while to load, so be patient.

Plot 1: Histograms for age at retrieval

Plot 2: Proportion of women with X or more eggs retrieved, by age and PCOS status

Plot 3: Proportion of women with  X or more mature eggs, by age and PCOS status

Plot 4: Proportion of women with X or more fertilized eggs, by age and PCOS status

Plot 5: Proportion of women with X or more day 5 embryos, by age and PCOS status

Plot 6: Proportion of women with X or more PGS normal embryos, by age and PCOS status.

Plot 7: Proportion of women with PGS test results

Plot 8: Proportion of mature eggs that are PGS normal (among women with results).  I suspect that the women <35 years old who have PGS results may not be representative. Others have estimated a higher fraction of PGS normal embryos from mature eggs in women under 30 (Esteves 2019 [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00099/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00099/full) ).  In our data, it may be that PGS tests for women under 30 are more likely to be ordered for women with a history of miscarriage, implantation failure, or factors related to chromosomal abnormalities.

<p>Data nerd here.   I made a data visualization of the IVF hunger games for this subreddit&#39;s data!</p>

<p>I divided some of the analyses by PCOS status, since women with PCOS generally have more eggs in a cycle.</p>

<p>Usual caveats: since this dataset is not from a random sample, the results may not be representative of all women undergoing IVF.  The plots can be found here:</p>

Results of egg retrievals, PGS testing, etc should be posted in the treatment threads.  Only pregnancy related test results are limited to this thread.

You can post the outcome of your pregnancy related tests here, positive or negative. However, **if a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, discussion can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** 

Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need. This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Discussions of positive beta and/or HPT results, beta hell, beta limbo, or very early pregnancy concerns are to take place in this thread.   Do not post images of HPT tests. An appropriate place to share photos of HPT tests is /r/TFABlineporn.

* Infertility includes:  primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top ""Read This"" sticky on the main page.** 

Once fetal heartbeat has been confirmed or you have graduated from RE, we encourage you to look for support and continue sharing your story at our sister community, /r/infertilitybabies. You may also be interested in posting at /r/whatworkedforme.  You are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences and continue to support other community members here on r/infertility.
 
 In order to keep this thread from getting overwhelming:

#) cycle 1: 20 eggs retreaved, 16 fertilized... 4 to make it to d5 blasts but all were determined to be chromosomal abnormal.

#) cycle 2: 16 eggs retreaved,... again 4 made it to day 5  blasts and again zero chromosomal normal again

#) cycle 3: human growth hormone shots 2x/wk, coQ10 supplements, b12 shots weekly.. high dose menopur for about 1 week, then certotide nightly for two nights, novarel trigger==&gt; 18 retrievaled follicles

Through the recent process my wife had high AMH levels(7ish), estrogen topped out at 5,000... close to 40 follicles on vaginal US leading upto retrieval... lead to 18 retreaved eggs (wonder why the number was so low, will ask the doctor) We are very hopeful..

Question:

1) what are the experiences of those over or close to 40 years old?

2) any experiences for those who had high aneuploidy rates on PGS testing (for us 36 retrieved over 2 cycles and zero normal embryos)??

Just hopeful and scared at the same time

**10/26/19: update on day2 after retrieval... 15 of 18 follicles were fertilized.. so hopeful but trying not to get our hopes too high!

**11/1/19: We would be so thrilled to have even one PGS normal embryo.. so we got a call today and the doctor notified us they froze 4 blasts and we will find out the PGS results next Friday potentially.

******update guys!!! We got 2 PGS normal embryos with cycle 3!!! We are so happy and feel so blessed!! Hope the transfer will go well :)

<p>**10/26/19: update on day2 after retrieval... 15 of 18 follicles were fertilized.. so hopeful but trying not to get our hopes too high!</p>

<p>**11/1/19: We would be so thrilled to have even one PGS normal embryo.. so we got a call today and the doctor notified us they froze 4 blasts and we will find out the PGS results next Friday potentially.</p>

<p>******update guys!!! We got 2 PGS normal embryos with cycle 3!!! We are so happy and feel so blessed!! Hope the transfer will go well :)
Planning for another cycle to hopefully bank a few more embryos if possible</p>

So I haven’t been on here in a while. Reading and talking about infertility every day was just getting too much for me. So I recovered my sanity and finally, after moving and all kinds of things getting in the way, I was able to go to a specialist. So after all this time with unexplained infertility, I found out that I have low MHA which, if you don’t know, means that I have a low reserve of eggs for a 29 year old. There’s still some tests to do, but basically we are looking at IVF. This sucks for obvious reasons, but it’s nice to have some kind of action plan. 

I would appreciate some personal experiences with IVF including the hormone treatments and extractions as well as the whole process in general. Money is of course an issue in all of this. What have y’all done to curtail costs? Have any of you gone to Mexico for it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

206,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"OK. I found out yesterday that our IVF cycle failed (0 embryos at day 5). Definitely having some shitty emotions, but I'm handling them in the healthiest possible way, by ignoring them and thinking about strategy.  I'm not sure whether we'll try this again, bail on the whole endeavor, switch to my partner's eggs, what.  I'm wondering if you all (especially people who have been through multiple or failed rounds of IVF) can help me figure a couple things out. I'll put the questions here and then put details about my cycle & personal stats.

First, whatever we end up doing, I'm planning a regroup with the doctor. What should I ask? Obviously I'm planning to ask what he thinks happened, what he thinks would happen if we tried another cycle, and what he'd change about my protocol if we did another cycle. Is there anything more specific I should be asking? Any testing I should be asking for?  I've had all the basic bloodwork done, plus carrier screening and karyotyping for myself.

Second, I'm wondering if you have advice about what I might try differently if I were to do another round of IVF, either in terms of cycle structure or preparation. My details are below for context. Mostly I'm trying to think about whether there'd be any reason to think a second round would have a different outcome.  I would love help thinking about what interventions to ask about, both with my current doc and if we switch to CNY (which we might for financial reasons).

***Cycle details***

Antagonist protocol. 17 days of BCP priming. 150 IU of menopur, 225 IU of Gonal F, and 1/3 of a vial of HGH daily during stims. 11ish days of stims, started cetrotide on day 6 or so (I can look up these details if they matter). Everything looked good the whole time.

*Cycle results:* 14 eggs retrieved, 12 mature, 6 fertilized normally with ICSI (most others fertilized abnormally), 0 blastocysts (all made it to day 3 and then arrested). We had planned to do PGS testing but, nothing to test.

tl; dr, everything looked good and we got zero embryos.

***My details***

37, AMH measured last year at 1.15, FSH at 7.2ish (redrawn this year at 9.6 I think? Something like that). Regular menstrual cycles, suspected endometrioma on one ovary. I am queer and my partner does not have sperm, so we had 5 failed lower-tech rounds before switching to IVF: one unmedicated fresh insem, one unmedicated IUI, 3 letrozole IUIs. Everything looked good on the ultrasounds for those except once my lining was a little thin.

*Other meds:* I'm on meds for borderline low thyroid (fine except for conception/pregnancy) and taking metformin 750 mg XR 1x/day for fertility.  Thyroid meds started last December, metformin started in July.

*Supplements:* prenatal, fish oil, vitamin D (recently tested around 50), açai, pycnogenol, CoQ10, probiotic, melatonin (only for \~6 weeks).

*Lifestyle shit:* I work out 2-4 times a week, mostly Crossfit, and have for about a year.  Before that I was running more.  I am personally very happy with my diet: mostly vegetarian, lots of fruits/vegetables/whole grains/nuts/olive oil, almost all the bread I eat is homemade sourdough, fair amount of organic high-fat dairy.  I'd like to eat more fatty fish but we have ethical issues with fish.  I'm willing to make some dietary/lifestyle changes if there's good reason to think they'll help, but tbh all the things people & doctors suggest seem poorly supported and often contradictory.

*Sperm situation:* We have a known donor who has sperm with adequate but not great stats. Two confirmed pregnancies, neither of which was easy to achieve.  No DNA fragmentation testing yet. He lives 1200 miles away so it might be challenging to get a test done.  I also wonder -- my understanding is that Zymot is pretty cheap, and if that's the treatment for DNA fragmentation, maybe adding that would be more efficient than having him take a test to confirm we should add it?  (r/dnafragmentation doesn't seem to be very active).  He's not a close enough friend for me to ask him to take supplements or change his diet, and we also would have trouble getting more sperm from him (one of the motives for switching to IVF in the first place). We could switch donors but it's not easy to find a known donor so that thought makes me want to lie down on the floor.

&#x200B;

*Edit: got the report from the lab. There were indications of bad egg quality, including dark color and abnormal fertilization, from the beginning. Only 6 of the 12 mature eggs fertilized. On day 3 there were still 4 embryos progressing, but they were irregular and mediocre quality.*  


*She said that they would have expected to have something to freeze based on having 4 embryos at day 3, and that the fact that the embryos went from bad to worse between day 3 and day 5 means they can't rule out sperm quality issues. By day 5 the embryos were fragmented enough that they had difficulty telling if they were progressing. Two progressed a little to day 6, but by day 7 one had arrested and the other appeared to be missing the inner cell mass entirely, and had a disorganized trophectoderm that was starting to disintegrate.*  


*She suggested our donor may have some subclinical sperm quality issues that interact badly with my apparent egg quality issues. (He's also the donor for a mutual friend who has two pregnancies with his sperm. The first pregnancy/baby took like 17 cycles to achieve, but most of those were fresh/unmonitored, she thinks the timing was terrible on all of them and she may or may not have been ovulating.  She got pregnant within 6 cycles of monitored/medicated IUI both times.)

I have had 3 MRI/cat scans in my life. One at 3 weeks. One at age 15 and one at age 22. (I am 26 now.)

Also I experienced lead poisoning as a child. it was not severe though.

I live in WV where there is no mandate for insurance companies to cover fertility treatment. I've been contacting legislators since June to try to bring attention to the issue. There has been a little support, and a few Delegates are working on bill that will hopefully closely model the one recently passed in New Hampshire. Although they showed some interest, I didn't feel too optimistic. 

I recently worked up the nerve to contact my district senator who lives in my town and also happens to be the State Senate President. I was shocked when he responded saying he'd like my husband and me to meet with him, his general counsel, and the healthcare counsel in his office at the capitol. 

The meeting could not have gone better! Right from the start, the Senator let me know he cared about my situation and was ""on my side."" I made my impassioned plea for WV to pass a bill that requires insurance companies to provide insurance benefits to all residents. I provided detailed costs I'd had to pay out of pocket and included a comparison of costs someone from a state with mandated infertility coverage paid compared to my own costs (thanks, friend!). . I also explained that  I would most likely be going out of state for my next cycle since I couldn't afford the cost at either of the only two IVF clinics in my state. He definitely didn't like the idea of WV residents going out of state to spend that much money. He also mentioned the fact that the state's population is rapidly declining, and it's crazy that they aren't supporting people who do want to have children. 

The counselors were also supportive, and my Senator said he'd like to see changes as soon as possible, so he was going to try to get our state's public employee insurance agency to add coverage before the next open enrollment period in April. I told him I'd sent them a letter before and had gotten a less than positive response. He said, ""Well let's put the power of the Office of the Senate President behind it,"" and called the director of PEIA while I was sitting there. I could only hear one side of the conversation, but from what I could hear, the director didn't like the idea of adding infertility coverage. My senator told the director he wanted to see several pricing points, including the cost of a rider and the cost of coverage for everyone. He said that while he was working on the public employees insurance agency, the other Delegate could continue working on the infertility mandate. 

Before I left his office, he told me that he would discuss our meeting with the other legislators at their retreat over the weekend. I felt so hopeful leaving his office. I am cautious about becoming too excited, though, because a woman I work with told me my Senator can be very charming and is good at acting like he will get something done, but he doesn't always come through.

I have to take care of my parents (child of immigrants), and we grew up poor so I always wanted to be the good daughter by finding a good job so I could take care of them. I also looked forward to having a kid so that they could share their culture with my kid. I also knew that me having a kid would make them very happy.

Anyways, my coworker and I became pretty close and she was one of the first people I told about my infertility because she was one of the first people I saw after I got the diagnosis from my doctor. I was diagnosed with POI and my symptoms were really bad. I have the bone density of a 55 year old (I’m 35) I was severely vitamin deficient, and had sleep disturbances because of the POI (a lot of this went away after HRT and taking vitamins and calcium).

That was last year. Her grandmother passed away recently and I was so sad for her. The office pitched in and gave her hugs, we told her how much we loved her, and she was so thankful.

But I know if I share my situation I will be dismissed and judged. I will be pitied and invalidated and so I would rather not say anything. 

I love her as a friend but it is so hard being around her. I hate seeing how her life is progressing because it’s a reminder of what I don’t have and I don’t have direction. It doesn’t help that she’s younger than me and has social support and financial support. I know her life isn’t perfect but I can’t help but focus on what she has and I don’t.

She got so much love and support from her work community about a loss that didn’t even affect her. At the same time I desperately wish I could have gotten a hug or some non-judgmental comments about my situation (1 donor egg retrieval and used my life savings so can’t do another one). But I know if I share my situation I will be dismissed and judged. I will be pitied and invalidated and so I would rather not say anything. </p>

<p>I love her as a friend but it is so hard being around her. I hate seeing how her life is progressing because it’s a reminder of what I don’t have and I don’t have direction. It doesn’t help that she’s younger than me and has social support and financial support. I know her life isn’t perfect but I can’t help but focus on what she has and I don’t. </p>

<p>I don’t know how to cope with being around a friend that has it all. What to do?</p>

I work in the cycling x tech industry, and riding a bike is a big part of my life. I ride my bike to work and usually add some miles on in the mornings to get some additional saddle time. Lately, I've been riding somewhere around 10 hours per week at moderate intensity (average HR is usually about 140). I'm not doing any intervals or really high intensity exercise, and I'm also not doing any long rides like I used to (2 hours is my limit for now). 

Part of what I think is tough about getting good info on this topic is the fact that there doesn't seem to be much in the way of standard amounts, types, or intensities of exercise that are deemed acceptable or unacceptable, and an individual's history doesn't seem to factor much into the equation. My current routine is pretty moderate for me, a former bike racer who used to train and race for 20 hours a week. However, for someone with a different history, 10 hours at 140HR is a lot. 

I've asked my clinic for guidance on this and provided them with specific information about what I'm currently doing, but I would love to hear from anyone here who has found any good information on this topic.",t2_kil7g,False,,0,False,Exercise and fertility treatment,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_dli21u,False,dark,0.92,,public,10,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,10,,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1571780265.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I would love to exchange information and experiences with exercise and fertility treatment, since the information I see when I google is inconsistent and a bit anxiety provoking.

266,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband and I have some big decisions to make over the next few days, and thought it would be a good time to ask the hive mind for advice. **Tl;dr:** we now have a history of two failed FETs (one miscarriage, one failure to implant), and need to decide whether to request additional testing or treatment before proceeding with more transfers. **I would particularly love to hear from anyone with knowledge or experience of autoimmune issues, low beta 3 integrin, poor egg/embryo quality, and/or a history of implantation failure or miscarriage with PGS normal embryos.**

&#x200B;

**Recap of recent events:**

* I have a complicated health history and terrible egg quality, confirmed by science! (You might remember me from my giant [split-cycle experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bcvmip/split_cycles_on_being_a_human_science_experiment/) last spring.) As a result of our 4 prior retrievals, we ended up with 6 PGS normal blasts of varying genetics and grades:
   * 2 with our own DNA but very poor morphology (C-)
   * 3 donor egg embryos (B+, B+, and C)
   * 1 donor sperm embryo (C-)
   * and 1 low level mosaic with our DNA (aneuploid +5, +14, grade C-)
* **FET #1** **(TW: loss):** We transferred our best-looking embryo with our DNA (day 6, grade C-, PGS normal) in the spring. Assuming that my autoimmune issues would come into play, we did a ""kitchen sink"" medicated FET with added prednisone, intralipids, neupogen, and lovenox. The embryo implanted right away (I had a positive FRER on 4dp5dt), but my HCG levels were low from the start (46 on 9dp5dt). My clinic told me not to worry about the actual HCG level because it was doubling perfectly and we hit all of our milestones on time. By week 7 they said it didn't matter that HCG was on the lower end (around 15,000 at that point) because the baby was measuring perfectly and had a strong heartbeat (150). A few days after that visit, they told me to stop the prednisone and most of my supplements. Just when we had started to relax a bit, at our ""graduation"" appointment we found out that the baby no longer had a heartbeat. She was measuring at exactly 8 weeks, and must have died only 1-2 days before the scan. We had [POC testing done through LabCorp](https://www.labcorp.com/test-menu/39841/microarray-products-conception-poc-reveal®-ffpe#), in case she was one of the 4% of embryos whose PGS results are inaccurate. This confirmed that she was euploid, as the initial PGS test (through Igenomix) had found. (However, the LabCorp POC testing cannot detect balanced rearrangements or low level mosaicism, so I suppose that's still a possibility.) With this information, my RE said his only regret is that he didn't keep me on prednisone longer.
* **Retrieval #5:** Based on the fact that I had been pregnant for a full 8 weeks, my RE had renewed hope for us and convinced us to try one more retrieval; he felt so strongly about it that he gave us a discount and also offered to simultaneously transfer ""our"" last blast for free. We repeated the same microdose lupron protocol that had worked in cycle 4, with a few minor tweaks: I was on prednisone during stims (to prep for transfer), I had been on metformin for a few extra months, I took a higher dose of methylfolate, and we used the Zymot device (because if my eggs are shitty, why not surround them with only the best sperm?). Shockingly, we ended up with 3 day 6 blasts, graded B+, B+, and B-:  Our absolute best round yet, in terms of blast rate and morphology. We're still waiting on PGS results, though, and assuming we'll get nothing because historically, 80% of my blasts are ""chaotic abnormal.""
* **FET #2:** This was a ""fresh"" transfer of our last frozen blast that shared DNA with both of us (day 6, grade C- with ""questionable ICM,"" PGS normal), on day 5 after our last retrieval. We did the same kitchen sink autoimmune protocol as last time, but with higher doses of prednisone. And of course, my uterine environment could have been different because it was a fresh cycle rather than a medicated FET. On the day of transfer, the embryo thawed ok but clearly did not look good. The embryologist said she still couldn't visualize an inner cell mass, and stressed multiple times that it was very poor quality and that ""we usually don't freeze blasts of such low quality."" I'm now 8 days post transfer and very clearly not pregnant, but I need to wait until Tuesday for my beta. I'm still taking my PIO though, in hopes that I can delay my period by a few days and buy us time to talk to my RE and make decisions about what to do next. Although this was a failed transfer, we're not rushing to blame my body because we know that the embryo was such poor quality (my husband actually said, ""this one doesn't count"").

&#x200B;

**QUESTION: Can anyone think of any additional testing or interventions we should pursue before doing a 3rd transfer?**

* We might have the opportunity to start another FET cycle this week; otherwise we'd probably have to wait until January due to the annual lab closure in late December.
* Assuming we're down to the donor-created embryos, we'd possibly be willing to gamble *one* of them on a 3rd FET right away. However, after that (or if we manage to get a normal from cycle 5), the remaining embryos will all be unique in terms of parentage, quality, and gender. So while on the one hand, **we've never tried an FET with a good-quality embryo** (and maybe that's all we need!), on the other hand we also don't want to ""waste"" any unique embryos on a repeat of the same protocol if there's anything else we should be trying first.
* **We've never consulted with a reproductive immunologist;** given my existing autoimmune diseases, my RE just gave me the ""kitchen sink"" autoimmune protocol without testing. However, I wonder if maybe the prednisone or the intralipds could do more harm than good (since my diseases are well-controlled at the moment, and I've heard that some natural killer cells are needed for implantation), *or* if testing would reveal the need for additional or more precise autoimmune treatments.
* **The only known abnormality we haven't yet addressed is that my beta 3 integrin came back low** (as measured by ReceptivaDx during a natural cycle). My RE believes this doesn't have an effect during medicated FETs - and also thinks that because I achieved implantation before, it's a moot point. My understanding is that low beta 3 integrin is associated with implantation failure. But I also wonder if it can lead to *poor* implantation - essentially, a pregnancy that is doomed to miscarry. But there doesn't seem to be enough research to determine this. My understanding from searching this sub is that the treatment for low beta 3 integrin is to take lupron for 2 months before FET, which sounds like the least fun thing in the world - but I'm wondering if those of you who know more about this think I should try it.

&#x200B;

**Medical History & Infertility Testing:**

* My health history includes 2 autoimmune diseases: **ulcerative colitis**, which has been controlled for the past few years by weekly Humira injections, and **Hashimoto's Disease**, diagnosed by thyroid nodule biopsy and very mildly elevated thyroid antibodies (anti-TPO = 13). My TSH, T3, and T4 levels have always been in the normal range, so I haven't required any treatment. We just consider my thyroid to be a ticking time-bomb that needs frequent monitoring. My doctors think my poor egg quality is likely related to some underlying autoimmune mechanism.
* I have a small **prolactinoma** currently controlled by cabergoline.
* My ERA came back normal/receptive during a mock medicated FET cycle; we followed this timing for my first FET.
* I've **always wondered if I have endometriosis** because my periods are very painful and extremely heavy, with large clots (the clots make even super-plus tampons useless, and I can overflow a diva cup in an hour).
* ReceptivaDx came back normal during my mock FET cycle: BCL-6 expression was low (0.6), suggestive of a low risk of endometriosis. However, it did say that my endometrium was out of phase:  ""secretory endometrium with **glandular stromal dyssynchrony** with glands postovulatory day 3 (day 17) and stroma postovulatory day 9 (day 23)."" My RE said this was a typical result for a medicated cycle, and that he trusts ERA results more than he trusts the older endometrial phase tests.
* We repeated the ReceptivaDx during an unmedicated cycle after our loss, in order to test for beta 3 integrin. The biopsy was taken 7 days after my LH surge, and 6 or 7 days after ovulation. This time my endometrium was in-phase, but **beta 3 integrin was low (0.4),** ""which may represent a luteal phase defect."" From searching the sub and reading a few research studies, I see that this finding is associated with implantation failure. My RE isn't overly concerned about it because I achieved implantation with our first FET.
* Hysteroscopy has always looked good, though I did have a small **polyp** removed and was treated for **endometritis** prior to my first FET. A hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in between my loss and FET #2 confirmed that the endometritis had not come back.
* My RPL panel came back normal, aside from the MTHFR.
* My [Fertilome results](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8vo4k8/fertilome_results_pof_rpl/) include moderate risk factors for primary ovarian insufficiency (**GDF9)** and moderate risk factors for repeated pregnancy loss due to immune response regulation (**IL18)** and blood circulation issues (due to being compound heterozygous for **MTHFR**). I take a methylfolate supplement for the MTHFR.
* It probably doesn't matter now that we're not planning any future retrievals, but in addition to the methylfolate I take [a ton of other supplements](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/b3oqo1/thursday_am_active_treatment_thread/ej1qr1n?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). (But then again, our loss happened only a few days after I stopped the supplements.)

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Recap of recent events:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have a complicated health history and terrible egg quality, confirmed by science! (You might remember me from my giant <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bcvmip/split_cycles_on_being_a_human_science_experiment/"">split-cycle experiment</a> last spring.) As a result of our 4 prior retrievals, we ended up with 6 PGS normal blasts of varying genetics and grades:

<ul>
<li>2 with our own DNA but very poor morphology (C-)</li>
<li>3 donor egg embryos (B+, B+, and C)</li>
<li>1 donor sperm embryo (C-)</li>
<li>and 1 low level mosaic with our DNA (aneuploid +5, +14, grade C-)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>FET #1</strong> <strong>(TW: loss):</strong> We transferred our best-looking embryo with our DNA (day 6, grade C-, PGS normal) in the spring. Assuming that my autoimmune issues would come into play, we did a &quot;kitchen sink&quot; medicated FET with added prednisone, intralipids, neupogen, and lovenox. The embryo implanted right away (I had a positive FRER on 4dp5dt), but my HCG levels were low from the start (46 on 9dp5dt). My clinic told me not to worry about the actual HCG level because it was doubling perfectly and we hit all of our milestones on time. By week 7 they said it didn&#39;t matter that HCG was on the lower end (around 15,000 at that point) because the baby was measuring perfectly and had a strong heartbeat (150). A few days after that visit, they told me to stop the prednisone and most of my supplements. Just when we had started to relax a bit, at our &quot;graduation&quot; appointment we found out that the baby no longer had a heartbeat. She was measuring at exactly 8 weeks, and must have died only 1-2 days before the scan. We had <a href=""https://www.labcorp.com/test-menu/39841/microarray-products-conception-poc-reveal%C2%AE-ffpe#"">POC testing done through LabCorp</a>, in case she was one of the 4% of embryos whose PGS results are inaccurate. This confirmed that she was euploid, as the initial PGS test (through Igenomix) had found. (However, the LabCorp POC testing cannot detect balanced rearrangements or low level mosaicism, so I suppose that&#39;s still a possibility.) With this information, my RE said his only regret is that he didn&#39;t keep me on prednisone longer.</li>
<li><strong>Retrieval #5:</strong> Based on the fact that I had been pregnant for a full 8 weeks, my RE had renewed hope for us and convinced us to try one more retrieval; he felt so strongly about it that he gave us a discount and also offered to simultaneously transfer &quot;our&quot; last blast for free. We repeated the same microdose lupron protocol that had worked in cycle 4, with a few minor tweaks: I was on prednisone during stims (to prep for transfer), I had been on metformin for a few extra months, I took a higher dose of methylfolate, and we used the Zymot device (because if my eggs are shitty, why not surround them with only the best sperm?). Shockingly, we ended up with 3 day 6 blasts, graded B+, B+, and B-:  Our absolute best round yet, in terms of blast rate and morphology. We&#39;re still waiting on PGS results, though, and assuming we&#39;ll get nothing because historically, 80% of my blasts are &quot;chaotic abnormal.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>FET #2:</strong> This was a &quot;fresh&quot; transfer of our last frozen blast that shared DNA with both of us (day 6, grade C- with &quot;questionable ICM,&quot; PGS normal), on day 5 after our last retrieval. We did the same kitchen sink autoimmune protocol as last time, but with higher doses of prednisone. And of course, my uterine environment could have been different because it was a fresh cycle rather than a medicated FET. On the day of transfer, the embryo thawed ok but clearly did not look good. The embryologist said she still couldn&#39;t visualize an inner cell mass, and stressed multiple times that it was very poor quality and that &quot;we usually don&#39;t freeze blasts of such low quality.&quot; I&#39;m now 8 days post transfer and very clearly not pregnant, but I need to wait until Tuesday for my beta. I&#39;m still taking my PIO though, in hopes that I can delay my period by a few days and buy us time to talk to my RE and make decisions about what to do next. Although this was a failed transfer, we&#39;re not rushing to blame my body because we know that the embryo was such poor quality (my husband actually said, &quot;this one doesn&#39;t count&quot;).</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can anyone think of any additional testing or interventions we should pursue before doing a 3rd transfer?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We might have the opportunity to start another FET cycle this week; otherwise we&#39;d probably have to wait until January due to the annual lab closure in late December.</li>
<li>Assuming we&#39;re down to the donor-created embryos, we&#39;d possibly be willing to gamble <em>one</em> of them on a 3rd FET right away. However, after that (or if we manage to get a normal from cycle 5), the remaining embryos will all be unique in terms of parentage, quality, and gender. So while on the one hand, <strong>we&#39;ve never tried an FET with a good-quality embryo</strong> (and maybe that&#39;s all we need!), on the other hand we also don&#39;t want to &quot;waste&quot; any unique embryos on a repeat of the same protocol if there&#39;s anything else we should be trying first.</li>
<li><strong>We&#39;ve never consulted with a reproductive immunologist;</strong> given my existing autoimmune diseases, my RE just gave me the &quot;kitchen sink&quot; autoimmune protocol without testing. However, I wonder if maybe the prednisone or the intralipds could do more harm than good (since my diseases are well-controlled at the moment, and I&#39;ve heard that some natural killer cells are needed for implantation), <em>or</em> if testing would reveal the need for additional or more precise autoimmune treatments.</li>
<li><strong>The only known abnormality we haven&#39;t yet addressed is that my beta 3 integrin came back low</strong> (as measured by ReceptivaDx during a natural cycle). My RE believes this doesn&#39;t have an effect during medicated FETs - and also thinks that because I achieved implantation before, it&#39;s a moot point. My understanding is that low beta 3 integrin is associated with implantation failure. But I also wonder if it can lead to <em>poor</em> implantation - essentially, a pregnancy that is doomed to miscarry. But there doesn&#39;t seem to be enough research to determine this. My understanding from searching this sub is that the treatment for low beta 3 integrin is to take lupron for 2 months before FET, which sounds like the least fun thing in the world - but I&#39;m wondering if those of you who know more about this think I should try it.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Medical History &amp; Infertility Testing:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>My health history includes 2 autoimmune diseases: <strong>ulcerative colitis</strong>, which has been controlled for the past few years by weekly Humira injections, and <strong>Hashimoto&#39;s Disease</strong>, diagnosed by thyroid nodule biopsy and very mildly elevated thyroid antibodies (anti-TPO = 13). My TSH, T3, and T4 levels have always been in the normal range, so I haven&#39;t required any treatment. We just consider my thyroid to be a ticking time-bomb that needs frequent monitoring. My doctors think my poor egg quality is likely related to some underlying autoimmune mechanism.</li>
<li>I have a small <strong>prolactinoma</strong> currently controlled by cabergoline.</li>
<li>My ERA came back normal/receptive during a mock medicated FET cycle; we followed this timing for my first FET.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve <strong>always wondered if I have endometriosis</strong> because my periods are very painful and extremely heavy, with large clots (the clots make even super-plus tampons useless, and I can overflow a diva cup in an hour).</li>
<li>ReceptivaDx came back normal during my mock FET cycle: BCL-6 expression was low (0.6), suggestive of a low risk of endometriosis. However, it did say that my endometrium was out of phase:  &quot;secretory endometrium with <strong>glandular stromal dyssynchrony</strong> with glands postovulatory day 3 (day 17) and stroma postovulatory day 9 (day 23).&quot; My RE said this was a typical result for a medicated cycle, and that he trusts ERA results more than he trusts the older endometrial phase tests.</li>
<li>We repeated the ReceptivaDx during an unmedicated cycle after our loss, in order to test for beta 3 integrin. The biopsy was taken 7 days after my LH surge, and 6 or 7 days after ovulation. This time my endometrium was in-phase, but <strong>beta 3 integrin was low (0.4),</strong> &quot;which may represent a luteal phase defect.&quot; From searching the sub and reading a few research studies, I see that this finding is associated with implantation failure. My RE isn&#39;t overly concerned about it because I achieved implantation with our first FET.</li>
<li>Hysteroscopy has always looked good, though I did have a small <strong>polyp</strong> removed and was treated for <strong>endometritis</strong> prior to my first FET. A hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in between my loss and FET #2 confirmed that the endometritis had not come back.</li>
<li>My RPL panel came back normal, aside from the MTHFR.</li>
<li>My <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8vo4k8/fertilome_results_pof_rpl/"">Fertilome results</a> include moderate risk factors for primary ovarian insufficiency (<strong>GDF9)</strong> and moderate risk factors for repeated pregnancy loss due to immune response regulation (<strong>IL18)</strong> and blood circulation issues (due to being compound heterozygous for <strong>MTHFR</strong>). I take a methylfolate supplement for the MTHFR.</li>
<li>It probably doesn&#39;t matter now that we&#39;re not planning any future retrievals, but in addition to the methylfolate I take <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/b3oqo1/thursday_am_active_treatment_thread/ej1qr1n?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x"">a ton of other supplements</a>. (But then again, our loss happened only a few days after I stopped the supplements.)</li>
<li>HSG was clear in November 2017.</li>

We had a 2 hour talk last night, one of many over the last year or so.  It’s not a fight, it’s always respectful and calm even though there are tears, but there is still never a resolution.  This morning I got up and cried more, and wrote this on my phone trying to get my thoughts out therapeutically.


It hurts...
I knew you weren’t crazy about having kids when we met, at 25 and you at 27, hell it wasn’t on my radar either.  When all my friends were having kids in their 20’s it seemed foreign, something I wanted no part in.  A part of it was that Mom couldn’t be a grandma to them, and she would have been amazing and that broke my heart.  The other was I just didn’t envision it, it wasn’t on my list of priorities-maybe later I would think to myself.
Then as our relationship grew those first few years, I found myself daring to think of us being married and get together long term and perhaps having a kid or two.  If you made a comment of “when we have kids”, or “our kids” it felt right and I could picture it.  But first I wanted to be stable and get my degree, not a good time for a family.  Then you lost your job and we struggled financially, not a good time for a family.  It was fine though, because it seemed like once we got through that we would be set, more stable, and you in a career you didn’t hate.  Then I gained so much weight I worried that it would even be safe to carry, so it was going through weight loss surgery and put it off yet again, but it seemed like the right thing to do.  That would mean that I would be 36 almost 37 when we started trying again, but people do it all the time.  Then we didn’t get pregnant for a year of trying, so it was time to get fertility testing done to see what’s going on.  We just needed some answers.  Then the dreaded IVF was presented as the only option for me at age 38.5 years old and you at 40, and the cost of 28K made it impossible.  Except...your parents offered to help and/or we could finance some of it....it almost...almost seemed possible. It was dangling on a string right in front of me, but I couldn’t dare spend that kind of money with no promise of success...that’s a new car regardless of where the money came from!  Again, it moved further and further alway from me.  Is that what makes me want it more?  How certain am I that I want this, how certain are you that you don’t?  

I’ve said that my options are: 
1-Stay....Convince you to try this more affordable IVF since you are good with us naturally getting pregnant, why is that such a leap?  Is it because you know it won’t likely happen naturally, so it’s your way of giving a little?  But then you say that you would be fine if we got pregnant...is it just your way to not have to make a decision, proactively go after this?
2-Stay...Come to terms with not having children and decide what else my life is to be filled with.  What does it look like?  Will I resent you, or will we be happy for the next 30+years as we have been for these past 13?   There has to be some thought and planning in this decision...we can’t just say, we’ll take it day by day...that’s not living and enjoying life.  Are we going to travel?  Volunteer?  Is fostering an option? 

What bothers me the most is when you said you assumed I would leave you, as if you are ok with that, like that’s even an option for me.  I think I know that you aren’t really ok, but you’re so monotone about it, no emotion, no pain from that possibility, it makes me feel like I love you more than you love me because I will stay either way.  I know that’s childish to say, but I’m willing to work through this.  
I don’t just want to be a mom in general, i want to be a parent WITH you.  I love us, I’ve always loved us and the relationship we built together.  The trust, love, friendship, support, communication, everything about it that make us special, and an all around great and happy couple.  That’s why it hurts when you think that I could just toss it away....I’m stuck because the 2 things I want to line up, don’t.  There isn’t a 3rd option, at least not for me.  So I feel like I’m being held hostage, even though I’m not.  

You said if we were 5-10 years younger this wouldn’t be an issue, you would be willing to go through it.  That’s not fair to say that because we couldn’t have done it then, the only option is to do it now.  So what were both basically 40, we’ve still got a lot of years in front of us.  

I know you’re concerned about the actual IVF process and what it would do to me emotionally and our relationship.  But I’m more worried about what NOT doing it will do to me and us.  If we do it, then we know that we actually tried.  Up to this point I don’t feel like we’ve tried, no real additional effort to see if this can happen for us.  Once we’ve done this, then we know, and I have no choice but to mourn and accept it.  

But what if I’m wrong about wanting a kid?  What if I push you to do IVF and we get pregnant, and then one or both of us is unhappy being a parent?  Then you will resent me or I will hate myself for trying so hard for something that I thought I wanted and then regretting it. 

Why is this so hard?  Why can’t we just have a surprise like so many others and we don’t have to make this conscious decision and painful journey for something that may or may not happen.

Thank you for letting me vent, get this off my chest.  My husband and I have talked a lot about this whole thing, but can’t get to any sort of common ground.

I’ve always seen my mother as very fertile. She had 3 children (one later in life with health complications) and was sure that, as her clone, I would have no problems conceiving when the time came. That being said, I was very conscious of my sexual health: condoms, birth control, selectivity when it came to partners. It wasn’t till I met my husband that I wasn’t extremely careful.

After a year or so of marriage, we still hadn’t had a baby despite trying naturally and myself tracking my cycle especially ovulation. When we went to see a doctor, they told me that I was too over weight to get pregnant naturally and to fix that before any additional tests were done.

I won’t bore you with the next 7+ years, but suffice it to say that weight loss, IUI, and adoption didn’t help my fertility.

Currently we are at a point in our lives where IVF isn’t an option due to cost (and honestly, I’m not in a mental state to even ask the question). Everything is “normal” for me and while my husband has lower testosterone and sperm count, they are within normal range.

I FUCKING HATE BABIES AND ANNOUNCEMENTS! I can’t stand them. I feel like the worst friend/ family member when I can’t be happy for those people in my life. We recently moved clear across country for work so it is a little easier giving false congratulations to people I love while online. Everyone in my life doesn’t understand where I am mentally and emotionally. Even my husband doesn’t get it since we do have an adopted daughter. 

My culture is big on new life celebrations and we had none of that, just a social worker dropping off the baby and reminding us that the next visit was in a few days. I feel like the whole experience was lacking. I was treated like (and told on one horrible occasion) that I was/am a glorified baby sitter.

I am craving that whole birth experience. I want to be able to create life with the one person I chose to live mine with. It hurts my soul. I can’t be happy for people in my life with babies and it makes me look cold.

I have been lurking for several months and finally decided to join this weekend. I think I waited because I had some vague hope that each step of the process might work the first time, and then I could skip merrily along to r/InfertilityBabies. Nope. I'm hoping to just participate in a supportive community. So few people in my life know that we are going through infertility, and I often feel very isolated.

**Backstory:**

* My (male) partner and I have been trying for almost two years total. I first met my REI doctor \~8 months of trying because the emotional toll of not having success was high for both of us, and I was just so suspicious that something was wrong.
* We (he?) ultimately received a diagnosis of severe MFI, with recommendation to go straight to IVF.
* First round of IVF happened this past summer. We were warned that we could very well not end up with any embryos to transfer because of the underlying diagnosis, but we figured why not try at least once. In the end we were very, very lucky to have several embryos to freeze (no fresh transfer due to high risk of OHSS).
* We did not do PGS. Based on my age, my doctor did not recommend it. Partner and I (mostly I) went back and forth a lot but ultimately decided not to spend thousands of $ on something that was not recommended. I still have some mixed feelings about this.
* FET #1 officially failed as of this weekend. It was a chemical, and I also think my progesterone might've been lower than they wanted (PIO only made me sore after the first few injections, so I have a \[hopefully irrational\] fear that no pain = I was doing the shots wrong). Being that it's the weekend, I haven't heard from my doctor about any changes to my next cycle. I am ready to just move on to the next one, but **dreading** being back on birth control--it made me feel horribly depressed during my last cycle.

**My Silver(ish) Linings:**

* I'm grateful that our diagnosis is (hopefully) clear and that we went straight to IVF.
* I'm grateful that I have some financial help from insurance, even if it's limited (I don't live in a state with mandatory IVF coverage).
* I'm grateful that I have easy access to sub-specialty medical care, especially at a clinic that is very evidence-based and no-nonsense about their approach.
* I was ambivalent about whether I wanted children for years. While I **hate** all this waiting now, it initially gave me time to think very hard about whether I actually want to be a parent (although I don't think anyone has to feel 100% sure before trying, ART or not).

I felt absolutely terrible emotionally when I found out we officially had a chemical, but the initial pain is fading a bit. My partner is more optimistic than I am. I know the stats based on how many embryos we have left, but I also can't shake the feeling that there's just no chance this will ever work. I tend to feel most optimistic when I'm actively in treatments, probably because it feels like I'm *doing* something, as opposed to all the weeks of sitting around and waiting. It definitely feels like my life is on hold, and I have no idea how to change that...at the moment, there's nothing I can think of that we would be doing differently if we were child-free by choice.",t2_436bqjr1,False,,0,False,Finally ready to introduce myself,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_dkike9,False,dark,0.88,,public,6,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Introduction,False,6,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1571600603.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><em>TW: chemical</em></p>

Being that it&#39;s the weekend, I haven&#39;t heard from my doctor about any changes to my next cycle. I am ready to just move on to the next one, but <strong>dreading</strong> being back on birth control--it made me feel horribly depressed during my last cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My Silver(ish) Linings:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m grateful that our diagnosis is (hopefully) clear and that we went straight to IVF.</li>
<li>I&#39;m grateful that I have some financial help from insurance, even if it&#39;s limited (I don&#39;t live in a state with mandatory IVF coverage).</li>
<li>I&#39;m grateful that I have easy access to sub-specialty medical care, especially at a clinic that is very evidence-based and no-nonsense about their approach.</li>
<li>I was ambivalent about whether I wanted children for years. While I <strong>hate</strong> all this waiting now, it initially gave me time to think very hard about whether I actually want to be a parent (although I don&#39;t think anyone has to feel 100% sure before trying, ART or not).</li>
</ul>

<p>I felt absolutely terrible emotionally when I found out we officially had a chemical, but the initial pain is fading a bit. My partner is more optimistic than I am. I know the stats based on how many embryos we have left, but I also can&#39;t shake the feeling that there&#39;s just no chance this will ever work. I tend to feel most optimistic when I&#39;m actively in treatments, probably because it feels like I&#39;m <em>doing</em> something, as opposed to all the weeks of sitting around and waiting. It definitely feels like my life is on hold, and I have no idea how to change that...at the moment, there&#39;s nothing I can think of that we would be doing differently if we were child-free by choice.</p>

294,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"This past few weeks, after retrieving only egg from our donor and seeing my friend pregnant with her second child, I have been a mess. I go to therapy once a week which has been helpful but sometimes the pain shows up outside of therapy hours and it's unbearable. None of my friends or family are going through this and they don't understand. While they are well meaning, talking to them has always made me feel worse afterwards.

Work has been really busy which as been a blessing and a curse, and I work at home which is also a blessing and curse. At times I've been grateful because I have something to take my mind off of things and stay in my pjs, but other times have been hard because all I can do is grieve.

Today was one of those days where I couldn't focus and I was getting angry with myself for not being able to cope. I tried to force myself to ""just work"" now and save my grieving for later, as if I could easily organize and schedule my feelings like a meeting in google calendar. Then I started to feel the stress and pain manifest itself in me physically.  My vision started to blur, my stomach started to ache, and legs started to go numb. I still tried to focus on work but tears started to trickle down my face. So after spending the first 5 hours of the morning forcing myself to work, I gave up and told myself that I need to allow myself some mental space away from work. 

I tried looking for some temporary relief - looking for and trying out online therapy chat rooms, reading about various infertility ways of coping, moving my body around, going for a walk, playing video games, reading reddit posts. This lasted for about an hour and all while having random moments of tears running down my face and getting frustrated that nothing was making me feel better. I started to get deeper and deeper into a negative mental space.

Suddenly, I just started crying uncontrollably. I've cried a lot since my diagnosis, but since seeing my pregnant friend and the egg retrieval news, the frequency and intensity of my tears reached a whole new level. This afternoon, I leveled up once again and I cried in a way I never have before in my life.

I screamed at the top of my lungs, I curled up in a ball on the floor, I pounded the floor ...all while tears, snot, and drool covered my face. It was the ugliest of ugly cries. After about 30-45 minutes of uncontrollable crying I suddenly stopped. I stood up and I literally felt lighter, it really felt like a weight had been lifted.

I had no idea how liberating it would feel to just let all my anger and frustration out through really ugly, loud, chaotic crying. I know it's only temporary relief but I'm glad I discovered it. It's almost like taking advil for a migraine. I know it's not a cure but it makes the pain go from debilitating to manageable.

I am not sure whether I am willing to knowingly give a future child a 50% chance of inheriting this from me. I don't think IVF with genetic testing is a promising option for me. I'm generally not a great candidate for IVF. Throw in the fact that BRCA1 would eliminate half of any embryos I might end up with, and the odds are looking really grim.

This is something I have already given a lot of thought to because of my past molar pregnancy history.

However, I am left with so many questions about the order to do to things in... If I decide to continue to pursue pregnancy with my own eggs, how much longer do I try for before deciding I need to move on to a prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy (and possible mastectomy) for my own protection?

This is my first post on here. I have used Instagram previously but found people didn’t really have much to say and just use it as a platform to update their stories. While this is great sometimes people need information or advise and I find there is little of that on there. 

I just want to know if anyone had any idea what could cause my issue. I have had IVF which didn’t work and I am now trying to explore why I can’t get pregnant naturally. I wondered if anyone had any information regarding low estrogen ? 

AMH - 36 pmol ( I have been told this is a great number. I’m in the UK so not sure of the conversion in US) 
LH - 3.9
FSH - 4 
Estrogen - 20 ( this is extremely low) 

These tests were done on cycle day 3. 

I have found information in regards to high FSH and low estrogen but no information for low FSH or estrogen. I have had my pituary gland tested and it’s fine. I am at a loss about this! I am not peri menopausal and my AMH is higher than most women my age so I know I don’t have low egg reserve. 

Is there anyway I can raise my estrogen? I am constantly being told I have PCOS and then another consultant disagrees with this and then i don’t have PCOS. I cannot keep up with it! 

Another bizarre thing is I have a positive OPK and a BBT rise which indicates ovulation but when I have a progesterone test it shows no ovulation. I have spoken to consultants and specialists about this and it baffles them and they have no answer. I feel if they don’t know what’s happening how can I ever get to the bottom of it?

First time poster but I've been lurking for the past 5ish months. If I post anything incorrectly/inappropriately please let me know. 

I am a 37-year-old facing secondary infertility. 

In March, we found out that I was expecting and was about 4 weeks along, but at 8 weeks lots of bleeding started and we learned that I had miscarried.  I had a natural (no D&C) miscarriage bled and clotted for 34 freaking days. I was getting my HCG drawn on a weekly basis and finally, on May 6 the bleeding stopped.

I started taking ovulation predictor kits, but never got a positive. Two months had passed with no period so in July I finally went in to see my obgyn. My OB prescribed me some progesterone to help jump start my period so we can start trying again and took some bloodwork. I got a follow-up call from my OB with the news that I have low ovarian reserve and there is a good chance I would not be able to conceive on my own. My FSH was at 16 and my AMH was .36. All of this was taken outside of a period so I was hoping the numbers were just way off.

My period came 5 days after I stopped the progesterone (August), and I got my period again – on time – in September. 

I met with a reproductive endocrinologist late September and we went over all the testing that would need to be done. We were waiting on my period to come so they could get me in for testing and of course - my period never came. 

I had some bloodwork taken and was put back on progesterone to jumpstart my period AGAIN. The following day I got a call that my FSH had skyrocketed to 45 and my AMH has dropped to .111. My RE wants me to come in on a weekly basis for bloodwork and I guess to monitor this crazy FSH issue. 

My understanding is my RE cannot do anything unless my FSH is lowered drastically, but I am also terrified of the quick drop of my AMH is going to make me lose my chances of any type of egg retrieval. 

I’m not sure if I needed to get this all out, if I need advice or hope - but here I am.",t2_27n6xrs,False,,0,False,Low AMH Super High FSH,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_djexxk,False,dark,0.9,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1571385081.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>First time poster but I&#39;ve been lurking for the past 5ish months.

So far, our employers have been very understanding (despite having no actual policy or guidance to follow) and allowed time off for appointments. However, my job requires me to work away from home a lot. Up to now, I've managed to schedule things because our appointment dates have been known and predictable. However, going forward I find I'm having to say no to travel due to the unknown nature of the timings.

I know what comes first (treatments and wife, obviously) but can't help but think it's hurting my career at the same time. 

All of that is basically preamble I guess. What I'm trying to ask is: if the injections to stimulate ovulation are started on a Monday, how long is it typically before the insemination procedure takes place?

 *Sub Rules and links to info and results threads below*

Welcome to r/infertility. **Please read our rules and our sidebar to familiarize yourself with the customs and guidelines of our subreddit before posting and participating here.**  
Please refer to the bottom of this post for the links to the Monthly Waiting and Weekly Results threads.

**SUB RULES**

Our sub has [strict rules for participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/about/rules). We ask that all members familiarize themselves with them in full, but here are the key points:

1. **All positive pregnancy test (beta & HPT) results should ONLY be mentioned in the weekly results thread (stickied under this thread each week). Discussions of positive tests, including beta-hell/limbo, uncertain results, or early infertility pregnancy issues/fears are ONLY discussed in this thread.**

2. Mention of pregnancy or live children is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as we had success after x,y,z protocol). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed. Note that mentions of pregnancy loss are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area. [More details of mentions of success and secondary infertility in this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dhp1rr/mentions_of_success_secondary_infertility_reminder/) Asking for success stories is against our rules. You may ask for people’s experience with a certain treatment but not fish for successful pregnancy stories.
 
3. Infertility is not cute, therefore cutesy acronyms (BD, AF (when used as a Aunt Flo), DH, embies, follies, etc) are banned. The full list of banned terms can be [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/bannedterms). As we all know, AF means AS FUCK. Yes, there will be cursing.

4. Infertility is stressful and it is easier to step on people’s toes than you might think. Please consider the emotional state of others during discussion here. Venting, jealousy and bitterness is to be expected.
 
5. No linking our posts outside of the infertility family.

6. If you see a post that breaks any of our rules or is troublesome to you please **use the report button**. The mods are happy to assess and remove or address reported posts. Let's all help keep this a safe, supportive community.

7. Set up flair so users are able to answer your questions with more information on your history. [Details on how to set up flair and what’s allowed in flair.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/db9xup/user_flair_reminder/)

**Guidelines**

* Use the dailies! There are AM & PM threads posted by the automod. The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to treatment. The Treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.

* Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD, someone else is going through what you are. [Details on when a stand-alone thread is appropriate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dehxt5/standalone_posts_faq_reminder/)

**Helpful Links**

Members of this sub can be here for a long time and certain posts can get repetitive. Please use the search function before posting questions that may be more common. A few helpful mega-threads and FAQ threads can be found at the links below:

[General FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index)

There are several spreadsheets maintained in the WIKI - Hunger games results, transfer data results, and medication pricing.

**Other helpful reddit communities you may wish to consider:**

For those who have been trying for a while or starting with infertility testing/treatment r/stilltrying has been a helpful transition sub for many before joining here.
For those who need support TTC after loss, r/TTCafterloss can provide unique support for this. For those transitioning to child free life after infertility r/IFchildfree is a safe space for this.

For those who have become pregnant after ART/IF treatment, or who have questions for people who have had success, r/infertilitybabies is for you.

For those with children who are experiencing infertility trying for more, r/secondaryinfertility or r/IFagain may be helpful and is a safe space to mention existing children while you explore your IF.

There is a sub just for male infertility as well if any of our male members would like to connect with others in their shoes - /r/maleinfertility and /r/dnafragmentation for more specific issue.

<li><p><strong>All positive pregnancy test (beta &amp; HPT) results should ONLY be mentioned in the weekly results thread (stickied under this thread each week). Discussions of positive tests, including beta-hell/limbo, uncertain results, or early infertility pregnancy issues/fears are ONLY discussed in this thread.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Mention of pregnancy or live children is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as we had success after x,y,z protocol). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed. Note that mentions of pregnancy loss are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dhp1rr/mentions_of_success_secondary_infertility_reminder/"">More details of mentions of success and secondary infertility in this thread.</a> Asking for success stories is against our rules. You may ask for people’s experience with a certain treatment but not fish for successful pregnancy stories.</p></li>
<li><p>Infertility is not cute, therefore cutesy acronyms (BD, AF (when used as a Aunt Flo), DH, embies, follies, etc) are banned. The full list of banned terms can be <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/bannedterms"">found here</a>. As we all know, AF means AS FUCK. Yes, there will be cursing.</p></li>
<li><p>Infertility is stressful and it is easier to step on people’s toes than you might think. Please consider the emotional state of others during discussion here. Venting, jealousy and bitterness is to be expected.</p></li>
<li><p>No linking our posts outside of the infertility family.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see a post that breaks any of our rules or is troublesome to you please <strong>use the report button</strong>. The mods are happy to assess and remove or address reported posts. Let&#39;s all help keep this a safe, supportive community.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up flair so users are able to answer your questions with more information on your history. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/db9xup/user_flair_reminder/"">Details on how to set up flair and what’s allowed in flair.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Guidelines</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the dailies! There are AM &amp; PM threads posted by the automod. The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to treatment. The Treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD, someone else is going through what you are. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dehxt5/standalone_posts_faq_reminder/"">Details on when a stand-alone thread is appropriate.</a></p></li>
</ul>

I've never had regular cycles and been ttc for about a year now. Obgyn has had me on metformin for past two months and just completed my first round of CLOMID (100MG).
