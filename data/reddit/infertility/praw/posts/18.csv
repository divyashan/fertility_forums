0,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"As many of you know, FET #1 ended in miscarriage in December.  I had a D&C at 7ish weeks but the embryo had stopped growing at around 6 weeks.  I stumbled through the rest of December and January. Not really sure how I got through it, especially the holidays, but as one wise person here said to me ""your mind steps in and protects you from the worst of it.""  I just tried to focus on putting one foot in front of the other and now, somehow, here it is, the end of January.  

Anyway, I had my WTF appt with my RE on Friday.  She told me that fetal tissue testing showed a completely normal embryo (not even any mosaicism) and again repeated that the miscarriage was just ""bad luck"" and that I am no more likely to have it happen again than I would be if it hadn't happened at all. She said that each year their clinic has 7-8 percent of their PGS normal pregnancies end in miscarriage and they don't know why.  She still suspects it has something to do with the embryo, something that they don't know to test for.  Finally she emphasized what a good sign it was that I got pregnant at all and said she was much less concerned at this point then she would have been if the FET had resulted in a negative beta or in only a chemical.  My RE then opened the floor to me to ask questions.

I asked about the following: repeated HSG, thyroid issues while pregnant (I was FREEZING for the first two weeks after my positive beta); endometrial biopsy; RPL and/or thrombophilia panel; karyotyping; testing me for MTHR, and testing for any possible immune issues.  Here are her responses:

1) repeat HSG:  She said if I had a hydrosalpinx it should have shown up on ultrasound but agreed to do a repeat HSG anyway, which will be this Friday. I need to get my uterus checked out anyway for possible scarring post D&C and the HSG will do that almost as well as the saline sonogram. She said if the HSG looks weird we can do a saline sonogram.  

2) thyroid issues: She agreed to test my thyroid again both pre and post transfer depending on whether we get a positive beta.  She said my temperature issues were probably just a normal part of pregnancy but that she would test me anyway.

3)endometrial biopsy: She said I probably didn't need this as I was able to get pregnant and haven't had any issues with infection.  She also said that I probably did have at least some inflammation due to the endo but that it shouldn't effect pregnancy.  She said she'd put me on antibiotics anyway though if it would make me feel better.  I haven't decided if I'm going to take them or not as I try to limit my antibiotic usage due to fears of killing off all of my ""good"" gut bacteria.  

4) RPL/thrombophilia panel: We are probably going to do this (depending on my insurance coverage) but she wants me to wait until 6 weeks after my HCG level is shown to be below 5.  Mine was 4.9 on Friday.  I'm not sure why I have to wait as I forgot to ask.  Has anyone else been made to do this?  Anyway, she said that clotting factors showing up on the thrombophilia panel are extremely rare and normally causes losses at 10+ weeks so she doesn't suspect it in my case.  She agreed to do the testing anyway though and wants me to start taking baby aspirin now.

5) karyotyping: We talked about this but might not do it due to cost, or at least not yet.  My RE said it's really expensive and while normally covered for the woman isn't normally covered for the man.  Has anyone had to pay out of pocket for karotyping and if so, how much did it cost?  

6)MTHR: My RE said that this is actually a pretty common mutation and lots of people have it without it causing any problems.  She said we could test for it anyway though and they could put me on a higher dose of folic acid.  

7) any other immune issues:  She told me not to worry about this as immune issues are extremely rare, I don't have any current auto-immune issues, and I was able to get pregnant.  I know others here have been told something completely different (especially about the being able to get pregnant part) so I'm taking my RE's advice regarding possible immune issues with a grain of salt.  It's not that I don't believe her....more that I realize immune issues are extremely controversial in the RE field and that she may not have all the answers here.  

If all goes well we are on track for FET #2 in mid-March sometime.  Unfortunately though I have to go in for my repeat PAP sometime in February to make sure that the abnormal cells burned off at my September LEEP haven't come back.  If they have then I'm not sure what the next step is-possibly a cone biopsy-but it most certainly will derail/delay everything.  

I don't really know how to feel at this point.  I felt somewhat hopeful on Friday after my appointment but now I'm back to feeling depressed and despondent.  I just don't see how any of this is going to work, especially if I need another LEEP or a cone biopsy.  I truly feel like the deck is completely stacked against me.  I also think Mr. Kitteh is ready to be done with the whole thing and I can't say I blame him.  Is there a worse form of emotional torture than this? I'm not sure there is (besides, of course, emotional abuse from a family member or significant other).  

Alright, I'm done rambling for now.  Thanks for reading everyone.  If you have been told something different from what my RE said I'd love to hear it.

I havent post in a long while, and used to on my other account (Shiny-Grenade). 
As I'm organizing a Stitch n' bitch with people at work and making them aware of r/knitting, will use another account to post here. 

Some know our struggle, but don't want to have to answer question on the incoming FET.

So, our background :
Husband has a balanced translocation, and near azzospermia.
First round of IVF in august 2015: Micro-Tese a success, but mo motile sperm. 26 eggs, 20 matures. 5 fertilized egg, at day 3, there was 4, but two with nucleus. No blast at day 5. Two blasts on day 5, but too poor quality. They were pushing them at day 5 for PGS....
So.... bust. 
Second round in november 2015 : First they thought they did not find anything during the micro-tese. Retrieval was awful. Scream and crying and traumatized my mum. 18 eggs, 10 matures.
Embryologist called in the afternoon, she managed to retrives 36 sperms, 2 mobile. She spend 4 hours looking for sperm.
Day 1 : 2 eggs fertilized. That is. 2. On day 3, they were perfect grade 1 (8-1-1). We had to decide to freeze them, or try to push them to day 5 for PGS. We decide to forget PSG and to freeze (OHSS, no fresh transfer was possible).

On the follow up appointment, our RE was really excite for us, after the shitty first cycle. She reassure us we took the right decision not to do PGS, that there is often goof results with Day 3.

So, anyways.

I'm on the Climara patches, and we have the first scan on Feb 5th for the FET.
I'm also on antobiotics, got a nasty sinusitus and bronchitis. At least, it's not a pneumonia? And doc said there should not be any impact on the fet, as anyways, the antibio will be over by then..... still... not possible to catch a break, innit...

I'm doing acupuncture, my osteopath helped with my pelvis area, so, did pretty much what I could.

I'm... kinda neutral about the FET. Don't dare to be hopeful, as even if it stick there, we won't know if it's normal.
GAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK.

I'm leaning towards a fresh cycle. The blast on ice will still be there if IVF #3 is a bust, and we might be able to get another one on ice. I'm young now and we've mentally committed ourselves to dealing with fresh cycles.

It turns out, the embryologist had made negative comments on egg quality before fertilization.

Here is my situation:

Age 31
ovarian reserve looks good (FSH 5.6, AMH 3.9, antral follicles always good)

First IVF:
Antagonist protocol with 4 weeks of BCP, Ganirilex, Menopaur, and Ovidrel trigger
Eggs grew great together with appropriate estradiol throughout

24 eggs retrieved (none that looked ""perfect)
18 mature eggs
13 fertilized with ICSI

Day 3:  I can't recall exactly but I think 11 or 12 still looked good here.  Nearly ALL A's and B's

By Day 5:  only 2 good enough blastocysts and transferred both.  Watched 7 more until Day 6

Day 6:  all embryos arrested 

So - clearly there was an egg quality issue.  Because my stim response was appropriate with a good number growing together, he wants to stay on the same protocol.  However, he is open to changing it because he understands that it can be difficult to do the same thing twice in a row.

He is ok with going only 2 weeks on BCP this time which I feel more comfortable with.

We're as good as can be expected. My husband had some setbacks, delaying his chemo treatments, and then ended up having surgery the day before Christmas Eve. He is doing okay now, and finally got back to his chemo. He's having a severe reaction to one of his meds, which is totally normal, but it's leaving him with horrible, painful acne-like rash all over his head (scalp AND face), neck, chest, and back. It's pretty awful. He's going back for chemo tomorrow- last week's was pushed off because of the blizzard. 

I'm just trying to stay positive and hopeful. I have all of my worries and fears locked away in a little closet in my mind, and I try to tiptoe past it, pretending it's not there. Sometimes the anxiety creeps up on me. I'm still having an exceptionally difficult time hearing about others' pregnancy announcements within my circle of friends. There is a girl in my craft group who is pregnant and due the same week I should have been, and while she's very nice, she tends to complain a lot about being pregnant. It just stops me in my tracks very often and makes me think, ""How in the hell did this become my life?? How did we get here??!"" I wonder how the next year will look like, then realize that I can't think that far ahead, so I wonder what the next month will look like instead. Then I wonder if I""m being entirely selfish even thinking about wishing we can get past all of this, and feel like I'm a selfish person for thinking about something like getting pregnant when we're really not even sure what the outcome of my husband's illness will be. Let's be really honest- the margin for success with his type and stage of cancer is extremely slim- and that's if everything goes according exactly to plan. Which, thus far, it has not. Then I feel terrified that I'll lose this wonderful man, and feel guilty for even thinking about ""myself"" and our infertility stuff. And I feel guilty, like I'm not grateful for the two kids we have together. 

And then I slam that door shut again and lock it, and run away and put my head under the covers so it can't see me, until maybe my next panic attack.

I know that's a lot. I know that's a lot to hear. I'm doing okay for the most part. I don't seem to really have many friends anymore. Lots of Facebook friends, sure. But everyone wants to know how ""we"" are doing and how he is doing, and then they want to not think about it anymore. I get it. I completely understand. I want to not think about it anymore- heck, even he wants to pretend it doesn't exist just for a day and not think about it. But I miss our life. I miss being able to plan things as a family, and not have to plan around bathroom trips, and changing ostomy bags, and making sure it's a clean place without crowds so he doesn't get an infection or illness. After all of that, it's just easier to stay at home and be quiet, and sometimes lonely, and just cross stitch (me) and play video games (him) and sit and wait for life to tell us whether or not we pass this horrible test.

I'm rambling now. All of that wasn't what I meant to say. And it really doesn't have a lot to do with infertility, but I guess that's a small part of it. I just feel like in this community, we can be really honest and other people just get it. We have learned that sometimes life just throws a huge pile of shit at you, and you have to sit there and just deal with it, while other people in your life are moving forward without you.

I ovulate regularly but the doc wants to give my husband ""more targets to shoot"". Wonderful image, right? Oy. My first round was fantastic - no side effects except tons of fertility signs I've never had before. Unfortunately, I didn't get pregnant but instead wound up with a 2cm cyst. I was told to take last cycle off to give that a chance to go down. It did, thank goodness, so here I am. Round 2 (ding ding ding).

How did the conversation went? Urgh... I have definitely mix emotions about it. I stayed calmed the whole time, but it was hard. We were there for 2.5 hrs and for the first 1.5 hours, everything came out from them (mostly him).

He initially began the discussion with :"" When I spoke to P (my husband), I was pretty much just pointing out that he doesn't ask how our son is doing"". Ok... so my husband explained himself that he wasn't aware he was doing that, and of course he cares about their child. He added that since they are his best friends, of course he has more interest in their child than any other ""just"" friends. This began a stupid argument: ""Well, you see more often your nephew and niece than our son and you always look happy to see them, but with our son, you look more happy to see our dog than him!""... I just wanted to scream at them: ""My niece is my sister's daughter, and our nephew is my husband's brother's child. OF COURSE WE ARE CLOSER TO THEM!!!!"" But I kept my calm and I just explained them that yes, we do see more often our niece/nephew but for the only reason that my sister, and my husband's brother: they call us and ask us to hang out! I reminded them that it wasn't entirely our fault: we both didn't make an effort to hang out! Of course, he was prepared: ""Well, how come you barely wanted to hold our son when he was born?"" I'M like ""are you serious? I was terrified to hold him, like I'm terrified of holding any babies! They are so fragile, I'm far from being an expert with babies! And he was a preemie, so it was even more scary to hold him!"" (Thankfully his wife stepped up and reminded him that lots of people are like that). Seriously, the discussion was just one ""attack"" to anything we did or said. I asked them if they had read my blog, which had great reviews from hundreds of people with or without child. Well, of course, they just read one or two post and the only thing they seem to remember was: I said that it was sometimes difficult for me to hang out with pregnant women and their babies. His reaction? ""I find it really hard to imagine myself in your shoes and that I wouldn't be happy for you guys to have a child!"". YOU NEVER LOST A CHILD! I reminded them that we all act differently with our emotions and that for me personally, it was hard. I told them that I was quite annoyed that he had compared our situation/reaction with others and that I thought it wasn't fair to do that. Of course, he added his grain of salt with how he gets it, but he still doesn't understand why we can't be happy for others. We ARE happy for them, but it doesn't stop us from being envious! 
Seriously, this conversation was long, and hard...I felt like it was the most hurtful discussion I've had in a long time. They were attacking (I say they, but it was mostly him) every parts of me that I've been working really hard to fix. I was always honest with them that I wish I was there with them (with a child) and that i was a little envious, but that I had never wish them anything than a healthy perfect baby! I reminded them that we were there for them the whole time and they confirmed that they really appreciated it, but (again, there was always a fucking ""but"") that it was hard to understand how we were dealing with this whole thing. 

The conversation was thankfully less dramatic (thanks to their son who was playing with my husband) and they asked about what was our situation at the moment and what were our next step... I should have kept my mouth shut because, you guessed it: The nutrition/fitness subject came out. I was prepared to tell him that I was following a similar diet to Keto and that I was working out every day to help me relief the stress and migraine. This began the whole discussion on how he has made tons of research for the past 3 years and how his diet (the keto) was proven to be the most helpful with fertility issues and etc etc... I know, I read articles too. But no, it had to go deeper: ""The worst thing to do is to let your body starve and you were counting calories for 2 years and when we went on vacation in Florida, you were barely eating for hours"". (side note: I used to suffer from emetophobia, scared of vomiting and it caused me lots of anxiety. So when I'm anxious, it is very hard for me to eat a full meal. While we were in Florida, I learned that I was pregnant) So his point for this whole story of not seeing me eat properly while I was in Florida was: your body needs fuel and even more when you're pregnant. You were not feeding your body!"". Was he trying to tell me that I actually killed my baby? Probably...but on the spot, I calmly explained him why I struggle with eating when I'm anxious. I wanted to add that I didn't know I was pregnant the days that I barely ate, fucker... but I didn't think about that while i was there... SO for the rest of the conversation, I just told him ""yes, you're right. Yep, I agree. Yep, totally!"".. So we left on good terms, but as soon as I got in the car, I became silent and all the discussion came back to me and I realized?

They were attacking me as a person. They made me feel like I had no right to be sad. The depression that is constantly crawling back from our miscarriages? Stupidity to their eyes. Everything I do seems wrong to their eyes. My blog, which has been such a huge help to me: an insult to them. My diet? I probably kill my babies for being an anxious person. 

I got home and cried and cried and cried...I even told my husband he should leave me, considering I'm the one dragging him into this mess. I honestly felt like I should die..(this was temporary) Thankfully, my husband has my back but like I said in the previous post, we are talking about his best friends, which I didn't mention but they are also working together. I know *deep down* , they were just hurt that we were not spending enough time with them, but I just know they have broken a very deep chord in my soul. They were important to me, but right now, I feel like they have broken all the hard work I've done in the past year (Seeing a therapist to help me with my pain and my envy, taking a positive approach in life, looking into alternative - adoption, and just trying to live my life the best I can with this huge ass cloud that is constantly present in my mind).

Oh and I also learned that the other couple is mad at us for the same reason, of not asking about their child and not visiting them. YAY... I'm clearly an evil monster.

I lost my left tube but my doc at the time didn't mention the state of my remaining tube after the surgery. My LP is normally 8-9 days and my OB/GYNs scrip of 100mg pills did nothing to help that. Taking those same pills twice a day vaginally gave me a 14 day LP.

I had an HSG today that shows righty is clear and Mr. Pants had an SA that shows 61.4Mill/ml concentration and 55% motility. The normal values on the sheet say 39.4-95.85 motility. Morphology isn't mentioned and wasn't checked on the test order form the doc gave me to get it done.

So we met with doc this afternoon and he said since everything looks good, we have a few options. 

First, a monitored clomid cycle plus trigger with timed intercourse. He says this may or may not give me an egg on the correct side.

Second, a monitored letrozole/injection cycle. He also mentioned 'more expensive fertility drugs' in conjunction with this. He said something about using letrozole to reduce the amount of 'more expensive drugs' necessary. I didn't ask specifically what drugs. Could he have been talking bout stimming? Is letrozole sometimes used with stimming? He said this will probably give me a few additional eggs so we're likely to get at least one on the correct side. This was his suggested option.

Third, a lap to look at my remaining tube. He wasn't keen on this because he doesn't think it's necessary yet. I'm just as happy to not have elective surgery just yet.

Fourth, IVF. We both agree this is nuclear option and not something he's interested in pushing or that I'm interested in pursuing. 

He said he really doesn't recommend and IUI because the SA came back fine so he doesn't see any indication it would help for the money required.

I went ahead and told him I wanted the monitored clomid + trigger cycle but I probably have about 3 weeks if I want to change my mind before the next cycle starts. While he was noting it in my chart, I asked for a script for 200mg progesterone so I didn't have to take the 100mg pills twice a day. He said he was going to up my clomid dosage from 50mg to 100mg and really didn't think I'd need the progesterone, but he'd let the nurses know I wanted it and they'd work with me on dosage and timing. I guess he's suggesting that the higher dose of clomid will give me a stronger ovulation..? I wasn't clear on this part.


Doc wasn't at all worried by his 55% motility, and it does look like well into the normal ranges this lab provided, but I've heard elsewhere that below 50% is a problem. I'm also a little confused about the lack of morphology reporting. I remember sometime last week someone mentioned pills they've got their husband on to increase his numbers, but I can't remember who or what day. What OTC should I have him take for better numbers?

I need to vent/and get your opinion...My husband, who I have only seen cried twice in 10 years had tears in his eyes when he came to talk to me this  morning. Turns out his best friend, who had a son in 2015, told him that he was disappointed that my husband wasn't like a godfather to his son, while his wife is always hanging out with the godmother (who happens to be on maternity leave too at the same time). He also said that my husband barely ask about his son. He is aware that we have infertility problems and that it's hard for us to be around babies but he was hoping he would still ask about him and to see photos (we don't need to ask for photos: they are all over instagram and facebook!) My husband responded back and said ""I admit, I don't ask a lot about your son, and i'm sorry. He's important to me, since he's your child,  but we just don't see each other as much since you guys have a new routine/lifestyle. I don't think it's entirely our fault. You guys don't ask us how we are doing with this whole situation or to hang out"". This discussion opened up a new can of shit: ""I understand you guys are going through a rough time, but please know that I know (and he names 6 different couples) who had similar struggles and they don't take it has hard as you guys!"".... GREAT! Now, our emotions are compared to those 6 couples who we don't even know but yet, it seems like they are handling their emotions much better than us and they are more interested in their son's life than us, the assholes with 5 miscarriages under their belt. 

I'm mad, sad, confused. His wife had to be on bed rest for 3 months at the hospital and we were there 4 times a week bringing them food and hanging out with them because: we could put ourselves in their shoes and we wanted to show them support! When the baby was born, we were meeting with them every week for supper and to watch a tv show..but then the baby had trouble sleeping so they were not as available, which we completely understood and gave them some space. In this circle of friends, it's just 3 married couple, and both couple had a baby who are less than 2 months apart. We are now the only couple who doesn't have a child, so of course, the dynamic changed! I find it extremely hurtful that he's making us feel bad for being ""bad friends/fake aunts and uncles"" to his son, who we do love, btw! He also added that he wasn't sure if he should invite us to his son's birthday, since he doesn't want to make us feel uncomfortable. My husband told him that yes, being surrounded by babies wasn't easy for us but for close friends like them, of course we would be happy to celebrate his birthday! Who does he think we are?! My husband NEVER showed signs of being annoyed by anyone. He's naturally quiet (he's introvert) so no, he doesn't show his emotions, but he's always the nicest and funny man. We are meeting them tomorrow to discuss about this whole situation and I'm extremely worried how it's going to turn out. I know my husband won't be able to express himself properly face to face, so I'll have to be the one speaking for the 2 of us and I have to feel ready. How am I going to go through this without wanting to scream at them for making us feel worst in our shitty situation? Argh...

OH! to add to this madness, him, the best friend, the computer programmer who has lots of interests in nutrition, decided it was also appropriate to say: ""By the way, I don't want to be rude, but I believe I know what you could do to help you guys have a successful pregnancy"".

We talked about my husband's sperm first and she said she'd like to give him 3 months on the letrozole before trying IVF again. As frustrating as that is to me, basically I'd start suppressing at the end of March so I guess not really that long. Next cycle in April. 

She also wants to try fertilizing half my eggs with donor sperm, I'm game, I think Mr. La will also be game. She said with MFI that severe she'd really like more information about what is failing. She also told us we don't have to use any resulting donor sperm embryos right away, they can be a back up plan. 

Mr. La is getting karotyped ASAP as well. 

For me, we're going to reduce the amount of time I'm suppressed, change up my stims to 375 follistim/ 2 vials menopur, and use way more HCG trigger with my lupron.

Before my son, I've never, ever been pregnant - even a miscarriage. About 4 years ago, I did the gastric sleeve and lost 60 lbs. It wasn't much, truthfully, but I did get one thing back, a timely period every month. 

Then after the necessary 2 years wait time, I got pregnant on my 2nd try. Although my pregnancy was easy, the baby was troubled. He came early at 31+5 weeks, was severely in uterine growth restricted , has many disabilities and will probably never be a functioning adult. He was never supposed to BE. 

We found out he has extra segments in both chromosome 19 and 21 (outside of the down syndrome locus). Then we found out I gave it to him. Basically some of the top of segments of my chromosome 19 and chromosome 21 swapped. So I guess my body gave him too much thus the duplication's. 

Specifically on my genetic results, it showed that balanced translocation women have increased infertility (check), miscarriage, and chromosomally abnormal children (check). It's a 50/50 chance this will happen again, even if I miraculously get pregnant again. And invitro fertilization doesn't help because they can't exclude the gene disorder. Once pregnant, if the baby has the duplication's or deletions, I would have to decide. I don't want to have to make the choice. I never thought I'd have to say No to having a baby.

Coming to terms with your infertility and anything surrounding that is a death, and you will need to grieve. It's a death of your dream. I've had many ""deaths"", the preemie death, the typical child death, the hearing death, the disabled deaf, the grandchildren death. It makes us tough, and we barrel through it, but that doesn't mean it gets any easier. Each death is special and something you have to work out.

Free app lets you set one or two reminders for your meds, but also, start and end dates. So you can input your meds schedule as soon as you get it, not worrying about remembering to enable your alarm a few days after you pick up your script. 

And, you can use start and end dates to have it remind you of different doses during your schedule. No more anxiety if you are waiting to ramp up estrogen or drop down fsh after a few days. (The free version only lets you use the unit ""pills"" but you can put in ""50"" so I assume you can put in ""300"" too for any dose of gonal-f, etc. )

She was going to put them up for adoption, but can tell we are a nice couple, blah blah.  Obvs, we finalize the adoption in the airport and go on our merry way with our two new babies. Hurrah.

Get home, invite my Mum over to meet the girls and as I take the toddler our of the carrier she turns into a tub of hummus (don't ask, I have no idea either). I'm losing my mind over this and husband says ""these things just happen sometimes. Babies just turn to hummus and no one knows why.""

Well, at least we still have one, right? I go to pick that one up and she turns to dust. So now, I'm cradling a tub of hummus, And going out of my mind. I wake up in tears and try to explain this to the husband, and (fair enough) he's not really understanding why I'm upset. ( Because of our fucking hummus baby, hello?)

...it perhaps doesn't take a trained professional to decode this one.. We start IVF soon, and after years of waiting, I'm maybe a touch apprehensive that it will all be for naught.

I have tried to discuss it with my husband, but he literally has no opinion and just wants to do whatever I decide. 

Here is my history: I am 31 years old, and my husband is 32. He had leukemia as a teenager and now has no sperm which has left us using donor sperm with IUIs to try to get pregnant. I have never been pregnant, but all along I have been under the assumption that I have no reproductive problems or infertility issues of my own. I have had several cycles worth of CD 3 labs over the years that are all normal, including TSH. I had a normal HSG last month. I am a normal BMI. Before starting treatment, I had regular but slightly long cycles (34-37 days), but had confirmed ovulation with opks and temping as well as post-ovulation progesterone labs confirming ovulation. I don't have endometriosis or any other medical problems that I know of. The only lab value I have that is a little out of wack is my AMH which is 0.96. I have never had an antral follicle count, and I can't remember whether I have had FSH/estradiol levels in the past, but I am going to repeat those this coming cycle to make sure that my low-ish AMH doesn't mean my ovarian reserve is super low. 

So far, I have done 5 cycles of medicated IUIs. The first 2 I took clomid and the last 3 I took femara. I ovulated on all the cycles according to opks/temps/ day 21 progesterone levels. This last cycle I even did a trigger shot to try to get the timing even better. I know using frozen donor sperm makes the timing harder, but I feel like that if I really am as ""normal"" as I had assumed, I should have been able to get pregnant after 5 months of IUIs with ""normal"" sperm. When I saw my RE before this last cycle, he said he would be willing do to up to 3 more femara/trigger shot IUIs before recommending we move on to IVF. 

My problem is that I am getting exhausted and my patience is running out with cycle after cycle of failures. I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall trying the same thing over and over again that is not working. I know if I get FSH/estradiol numbers back at the begininning of next cycle that look concerning, I will probably request we head straight to IVF. However, if those numbers look reassuring, I'm not sure if I should waste more time and money with 2 more IUIs. I'm afraid we are actually dealing with both MFI and female ""unexplained"" infertility. We are paying out of pocket for all IF expenses so insurance coverage won't affect our decision. We have the money, although obviously this is all very expensive and doing this the least expensive but effective way would be nice.

 I used to be very active in this sub, but 2014/2015 was absolutely horrible for myself and my family. For my mental health, I needed to refocus on other things for a while. But now I'm back.

In August of 2014, an HSG test revealed that my single remaining tube also was blocked right in the middle and IVF was our only option to conceive. Two months later, I was laid-off from my job of 8 years (along with four other people). I had *terrible* employment luck from November-April of 2015 until I finally found my current job. In the midst of this, my dad had a relapse with alcohol, and my Mom was diagnosed with an extremely rare auto-immune disease. All of this made this a really dark time for me and not being able to save for our IVF made thinking about infertility unbearable.

Not that that is all in the past, I'm happy to say that we have just under $8,500 saved for our IVF. We know that this is not by any means 'all of it', but it's a great start. Now we are just trying to decide what method we are going to use: i.e. loan, care credit card, our personal credit cards. 

I imagine after the consult you will start to see me around again, since we'll finally be making some sort of progress.

Her new nurse is very nice, but totally overwhelmed by this transitional time.  I get it.  I do, and I sympathize.  But... I called three Fridays ago to ask a question about when to begin my birth control pills, among other things, because she never specified CD1 or CD3 or what.  No call back.  Called again the next Monday.  No call back.  Called again Wednesday, which was CD1.  No call back.  So I wrote my RE and got a response right away to start the pills.  Called the nurse again that Friday and this time made more of an issue with the receptionist that I'd been calling for a week with no response (nicely, but firmly).

It is my first cycle trying again after a MMC, and my Dr prescribed progesterone because my LP is 10-12 days but has been as short as 8. Due to some phone issues and the weekend, I got the prescription late, so my first day taking it was 6 dpo. Is that too late to start?

My first issue is my labia minora has been very irritated since I started taking them. Kind of swollen, stingy kind of pain when touched. It mostly bothers me when wiping, I don't feel much pain sitting around. Is this normal? Should I ask to switch pills, or switch to oral? 

My second issue is the red coating. I expected the leaking, it comes out obviously in the morning, then kind of light pink. It looks like a light period flow. It has varied a lot on how long it leaks it seems. Sometimes I still see some light pink in the evening. At that point I'm not even 100% sure it is color or actually light bleeding/spotting.

AMH: 4.83 ng/mL

FSH: 4 mIU/mL

Does this sound like a normal IVF protocol? I know the first cycle is always kind of a crap shoot, but I'm worried I'm going to end up either over-suppressed or under-stimulated. 

Oral contraceptives (desogen) were started on 1/19 (CD 1). On 2/12 I will add 20 units of Lupron once per day in the evenings. Last dose of oral contraceptives on 2/18. Keep taking Lupron 20 units and I will have a suppression check on 2/26. 

Assuming everything looks proper, the Lupron will go to 10 units daily, and I will start Follistim 150 IUs once per day in the evening on 2/27. I will have my first stim ultrasound on 3/1. Estimated egg retrieval 3/10 but they gave me the range of 3/7 - 3/13

Does this seem normal? It seems like a LOT of suppression versus a rather low dose of Follistim during the stimming phase. 

I do trust our doctor, but of course we all like to google things and it's hard not to second-guess everything when you have so much time and energy invested into something. 

Does this protocol sound normal to y'all?

edit to add: My doctor did say they would be aiming for 15-20 eggs at time of retrieval, and we plan on doing a freeze-all for PGS testing.

He told me not to worry, and that if this doesn't work out, or if I'm ready to stop, we can use donor eggs, or donor sperm, or adopt an embryo, whatever I want/whatever the RE thinks will work the best. I was so happy I cried and cried, because I am afraid that maybe one (or both of us) might make crappy ingredients for babymaking.

Basically he made me feel so good about what we are doing, and omg I am not this sappy kind of person but he is such a great man, I am so lucky and I don't care that I was an old lady when I met him. He was worth the wait.

Basically we're going to try two (or three, results pending) more rounds of IVF and then re-evaluate from there. Then maybe either donor eggs using his sperm AND a sperm donor (mix it up) or embryo adoption.

102,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So I've been following this sub for awhile now, as my husband and I have been TTC for the last 2 1/2 years without success.  It's both depressing and a relief to see people in the same position we are in.  That said, I never thought I'd have trouble having kids (who does I guess).  

So after we got engaged, I got off of birth control and we just figured we'd let nature do it's thing.  A year later I was following my cycle closely and scheduling intercourse based on ovulation testing.  

Six months ago I finally started seeing a fantastic specialist at the Mayo clinic.  Initial tests that there was nothing physically wrong with us that would prevent us from conceiving.  Good news, but frustrating.  This resulted in 3 months on letrozole before we escalated to attempted IUIs.  

First two IUIs never actually ended up being IUIs, due to problems getting the timing right on my ultrasounds.  A week ago, however, I was told I was good to go for the actual IUI procedure, which was done on Monday.

I read up a bit on the procedure before having it done, as I'm a gigantic wuss when it comes to pain, but wasn't overly concerned after reading it was similar to a pap smear.  Unfortunately it wasn't that easy.  The first nurse who was attempting the speculum insertion seemed really unsure of herself, likely because I was making ""pain noises"" as she tried to get it in.  The worst part was that I wasn't aware that they didn't use lube.  A watered down speculum doesn't exactly glide in... So the first nurse gave up and went off to find someone else.

I lost it at that point, and just started sobbing. I'm sure the frustration of not being pregnant and the frustration of not being an ""easy"" patient just got the best of me.  So that's what the second nurse walked in on.

Thankfully she was great, and I was able to compose myself.  Second nurse had a much better approach with the IUI, and I was done in 2 minutes (plus the 20 minutes of rest on the table).  

So now I wait to see if it took or not.  I'm pretty sure I will only be able to do a handful of these before I escalate things again to full blown IVF.  I'm just running out of patience.  I've got the usual ""all my friends have kids/are pregnant"" stories, which are becoming increasingly difficult to hear or be excited about.  

Case in point - my younger sister already has three kids, with a fourth on the way.  She's also miscarried twice (one set of twins and a single).  The kids are wonderful and I love them to death, but when she handed out photos indicating she was pregnant with #4 over Thanksgiving to the whole family, I admit I was not thrilled.  I was pissed.  WTF do you need FOUR kids for?  Couldn't you be bothered to pull me aside and tell me separately?  By not doing that, I had the whole extended family (who all knows we are TTC) look at me to see my reaction.  Yup, I mumbled ""Oh, nice!"" and then quickly left the room to cry. 

It sounds like I cry I lot.  I don't - I'm more angry than sad.  I'm just sick of everything - sick of the questions, sick of the monthly disappointment, sick of sex as a chore, sick of every one of my inlaws having 3-4 kids each, etc.  

Either the IUIs/IFVs will work at some point, or I'll give up.  I hope it's the former, but I'm not sure how long I can go through this.  I really struggle seeing how long people in this sub have tried - seeing the miscarriages and other issues with treatment.  It could be a long and depressing road, and I feel for everyone out there going through this at any stage.  

I wish I could close this with a more optimistic tone, but that's not happening.  So...

The kids are wonderful and I love them to death, but when she handed out photos indicating she was pregnant with #4 over Thanksgiving to the whole family, I admit I was not thrilled.  I was pissed.  WTF do you need FOUR kids for?  Couldn&#39;t you be bothered to pull me aside and tell me separately?  By not doing that, I had the whole extended family (who all knows we are TTC) look at me to see my reaction.  Yup, I mumbled &quot;Oh, nice!&quot; and then quickly left the room to cry. </p>

<p>It sounds like I cry I lot.  I don&#39;t - I&#39;m more angry than sad.  I&#39;m just sick of everything - sick of the questions, sick of the monthly disappointment, sick of sex as a chore, sick of every one of my inlaws having 3-4 kids each, etc.  </p>

<p>Either the IUIs/IFVs will work at some point, or I&#39;ll give up.  I hope it&#39;s the former, but I&#39;m not sure how long I can go through this.  I really struggle seeing how long people in this sub have tried - seeing the miscarriages and other issues with treatment.  It could be a long and depressing road, and I feel for everyone out there going through this at any stage.  </p>

<p>I wish I could close this with a more optimistic tone, but that&#39;s not happening.  So...</p>

<p>FIN.</p>

So, yesterday we had a consult with a new RE. You guys might remember how [not great](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3v7fbp/do_i_need_to_see_another_re_how_many_did_you_see/) my first RE was. 

In summary, we had to wait 51 minutes to be seen. I was so pissed and annoyed by the time the consult started, I couldn't make the best of it. We should have rescheduled, but we were both already missing our morning meetings, so we decided to wait. Anyway, the RE was awesome. I really like him and I'm glad to have a Dr that is personable, gives me all of the options, explains things fully and tells it like it is while still being sensitive to our very important feelings. He's also the resident endo expert. :)

He said the best cure for endo is pregnancy. Did you guys know that? He said the vast majority of the time, if a woman has endo prior to pregnancy, after a full successful pregnancy, the endo almost never comes back. That's interesting.

Long story short. After one Clomid/TI and one Clomid/IUI cycle, he believes it's time to get more aggressive. I had a lap to remove the endo, endometrioma and ahdesions in October; we need to put forth our best effort now before the endo comes back and also because my AMH is low, right at 1. He said one more round of Clomid/IUI and then he strongly recommends injectables/IUI (25% chance for about 2k). He said he wouldn't recommend more than 3 more IUI's of any kind (I did one unmonitored IUI with the last RE) before recommending we move on to IVF. 

He also sent me for another round of CD3 blood work and let me know this plan could change based on those results. I do the blood draw tomorrow, should get the results in a week.

Then we did the twat wanding because it was also CD1 for me. Dr Silverberg found a hemorrhagic cyst on my left ovary and said we're benched for another cycle to wait for it to go down. So sad y'all, but our birthdays are next month, so yay wine? I was concerned because of the endometrioma I had before. I immediately thought I'd need another lap and I just *really* don't want to do that again. But, he said these are quite common and he has confidence it'll resolve on it's own. Any of you fabulosas have any experience with these kinds of cysts?

Completely unrelated: my husband and I see a couples therapist. We started seeing her weekly before we got married. Then it went to monthly, now it's just once every 3 months or so. We sought out therapy because we're both divorced and I have a communication issue. Our visits with her are not related to infertility in any way, and I believe she's helped us so much to be better spouces. Because we see her so little now, only in our last appointment this past weekend did the gravity of our IF struggles come out. She gave us some coping strategies, and helped my hubs on being more emotionally supportive. 

She asked me (not us, but me) a lot of questions about what I'm willing and not willing to do, and I didn't like them at all. Her *first* question was what about surrogacy. Bitch, you don't even know what the problem is, which means you don't even know if that's a viable solution. Next she asked how important genetics are to me? I mean, duh, they are important. She went on to say ""because for most people, starting family isn't about genetics and so they adopt"". What the actual fuck lady?! Most people *do not* adopt. *Most people have their own natural children.* 

THEN, and you guys are going to fucking love this shit, then she went on to tell me how one of her closest friends went through IF treatment, the whole 9 yards, and finally adopted. Then, woops, she's pregnant! I couldn't do anything more than a death-stare. Like, it's good I cannot channel the force or she'd be strangled by the air around her. I mean *she's a damn therapist!*

Why do people say this?! What is the point in telling anyone this? What is the expectation saying this will have? Oh, so I should adopt to have my own child? Then, what about the miracle of adoption? It totally degrades the first child! And what if then, based on your story, I go adopt and then never become pregnant (like what happens to most people in this situation)? How is that supposed to make me feel better? Bitch, how many adopted children do you have? None? How much does adoption cost? How long does it take? Are there any guarantees? Who is approved? My mother and brother are convicted felons, I'm sure that'll be an issue but you don't know, do you? In fact, no one who brings up adoption knows anything about it. My husband and I are not of the same ethnicity; do you know how many Persian/Caucasian babies there are on the market?! 

Okay, rant done. I think I feel better. 

Another question. This one is hard. I'm not excited about any of this anymore. I feel numb and I kinda just want to it to be over already. I still want our family, but I'm burning out. I've decided to do the IUI's and consider IVF (we're going to the IVF orientation our clinic does in February) because I want us to look back and know we did everything we could. But, to be honest, I'm not hopeful anymore. I full of dread. My feelings are making my husband sad about all of this. I try to tell him that feelings don't have any scientific bearing on our results. I just still cannot accept that we are here, that we need help, that we can't do this on our own. How do you keep hope? How do you stay positive and ditch the jealousy, body hate and self disgust? I want to be excited about having a baby again! I want us to talk about names like we used to, not my temperature or what progesterone suppositories do.

<p>She asked me (not us, but me) a lot of questions about what I&#39;m willing and not willing to do, and I didn&#39;t like them at all. Her <em>first</em> question was what about surrogacy. Bitch, you don&#39;t even know what the problem is, which means you don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s a viable solution. Next she asked how important genetics are to me? I mean, duh, they are important. She went on to say &quot;because for most people, starting family isn&#39;t about genetics and so they adopt&quot;. What the actual fuck lady?! Most people <em>do not</em> adopt. <em>Most people have their own natural children.</em> </p>

<p>THEN, and you guys are going to fucking love this shit, then she went on to tell me how one of her closest friends went through IF treatment, the whole 9 yards, and finally adopted. Then, woops, she&#39;s pregnant! I couldn&#39;t do anything more than a death-stare. Like, it&#39;s good I cannot channel the force or she&#39;d be strangled by the air around her. I mean <em>she&#39;s a damn therapist!</em></p>

<p>Why do people say this?! What is the point in telling anyone this? What is the expectation saying this will have? Oh, so I should adopt to have my own child? Then, what about the miracle of adoption? It totally degrades the first child! And what if then, based on your story, I go adopt and then never become pregnant (like what happens to most people in this situation)? How is that supposed to make me feel better? Bitch, how many adopted children do you have? None? How much does adoption cost? How long does it take? Are there any guarantees? Who is approved? My mother and brother are convicted felons, I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll be an issue but you don&#39;t know, do you? In fact, no one who brings up adoption knows anything about it. My husband and I are not of the same ethnicity; do you know how many Persian/Caucasian babies there are on the market?! </p>

<p>Okay, rant done. I think I feel better. </p>

<p>Another question. This one is hard. I&#39;m not excited about any of this anymore. I feel numb and I kinda just want to it to be over already. I still want our family, but I&#39;m burning out. I&#39;ve decided to do the IUI&#39;s and consider IVF (we&#39;re going to the IVF orientation our clinic does in February) because I want us to look back and know we did everything we could. But, to be honest, I&#39;m not hopeful anymore. I full of dread. My feelings are making my husband sad about all of this. I try to tell him that feelings don&#39;t have any scientific bearing on our results. I just still cannot accept that we are here, that we need help, that we can&#39;t do this on our own. How do you keep hope? How do you stay positive and ditch the jealousy, body hate and self disgust? I want to be excited about having a baby again! I want us to talk about names like we used to, not my temperature or what progesterone suppositories do.</p>

<p>And thank you guys. Just thanks for everything.</p>

I did my transfer for IVF #2 yesterday and I am not overly optimistic (still only 3-cell on Day 3 :/) so I'm looking to next IVF cycle.

My doctor thinks my egg quality isn't good. For some background: my husband has severe MFI issues where he can't penetrate my eggs so we needed to do IVF+IMSI, which was fine. We did IVF #1, and out of 12 eggs (8 fertilized), only 1 made it to Day 3. Then we did IVF #2, 4 eggs, all fertilized, but again, only 1 made it to Day 3.

Because of this, it's looking like an issue with my egg quality. They are fertilizing, but they stop growing and multiplying between day 2 and day 3.

If this cycle doesn't work (again, not optimistic, alas.) the doctor said we have to start taking vitamins and shots to try and improve my egg quality before starting IVF 3 probably around April.

So I was just wondering about supplements to help that. I just want to be prepared to ask him and get his ideas or approval.

I've heard of CoQ10, Ovaboost, Omega-3, Royal Jelly... But which are the best and which should I ask about? My doctor mentioned Vitamin D and DHEA as options as well.

I have an RE I love. He's available, does all of the US appointments, and tries to explain things in a supportive but informative way (his nurses are the bad-cop to his good-cop, but I can accept that). He's also regarded as the best in the area (we'll call him Dr. Good). I just found out that my insurance will cover 80% of IVF, but only with the local University's RE team (Dr. U). Tomorrow, my husband and I have a final consult with Dr. Good to see if there is anything else we can try before IVF (he's in network for everything but IVF), but also to somehow get his sense of the care at Dr. U. Obviously, I want to use my excellent insurance if I can, but I am afraid of a couple things: what if I go over to Dr. U and they tell me that IVF won't be covered until I try for another year? What if they are difficult and de-prioritize me and make me feel like I don't matter? What if they make me redo all of the bloodwork, and retry all the medicated cycles we've already done? What if, what if, what if!! Of course, It *is* great that I have some insurance coverage for IVF; but I am just so sad that I can't pursue it with a doctor I know and trust. Anyway- I came here to see if you guys have any ideas for questions I should ask Dr. Good tomorrow. Is it appropriate to ask him what he thinks of Dr. U? Other information I could get that might make me feel better about this?


**Update**: Guys, it was so hard. The RE was so nice, and said that we really should do IVF and that he wouldn't recommend that we NOT go to Dr. U (he said he would tell us if we were transferring to an RE he doesn't recommend) but that they're numbers just aren't as good as his. He still is encouraging us to do it, because how can we NOT try a place that will take our insurance, but it was disappointing to hear. Oh well... we're considering doing a *quick* COH (Is that the right acronym? just injection meds and timed intercourse) cycle with him before leaving for IVF; but it's hard to feel optimistic.

132,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone. It's been almost a year since I've last posted. We did some more SA tests on my husband after he had been taking Clomid for the last 6 months for a low sperm count (under 5 million) and it turns out that it didn't help the low count at all. Although it did raise his testosterone, which is good I suppose.

His doctor has to talk to my doctor sometime this week to see if they even feel comfortable with trying IUI's. After some research, I'm feeling like they're going to say we should go straight to IVF. Donor sperm, while a good option for many, is not something either of us feel comfortable with at this time.

We got this news on Friday, right before going out after work with friends, so at that time it wasn't that bad. However, Saturday morning I realized I just had to grieve a bit. I just have a really hard time believing that this is what we have to do to have a family. It feels embarrassing and I hate that. I feel ashamed. I guess that's ironic considering we're struggling with MFI. My husband is definitely handling this better than I am (he's a very ""it is what it is"" kind of guy). 

We have been trying for 2.5+ years now, and we've only told a very small amount of people that we're trying and struggling. We haven't told anyone that we are going to need IVF.  Part of me is just sick of keeping the secret and wants to tell people what we're struggling with, but the other part of me wants to keep it a secret because I don't want people worrying about us and asking us about it all the time. And like I said before, I feel ashamed. I know it's probably normal to feel this way. 

Does anyone here share everything with your close friends and family? Does anyone else keep it to themselves completely? I'm just feeling kind of dazed and confused about it all. This is a huge deal and, well, I'm just not sure if we should even tell anyone. How do I get around the fact that if/when we do IVF, I'm sure I'll have a million doctors appointments. Obviously I don't have to tell anyone at work, but I'm a bad liar and not even sure what I would say when people inevitably ask.

Sorry for the rambling. I think I just need a little encouragement :(

At 15 years old, I stopped ovulating...And at just 16 I was told that I might never have children. It's okay though! Since then I have discovered why and was very recently informed that I *SHOULD* be able to but almost certainly with a lot of assistance (I've been advised that IVF will likely be necessary). 

Now, for the first time in my life I'm at a point where I'm talking seriously with my SO about having children. I've had the contraceptive implant in my arm for years - not for the sake of contraception, but for its effect on my hormone levels, so I'm getting that removed soon. 

Yet...I'm terrified. I guess when every other girl was being told about pregnancy and periods and such it was never relevant to me. I know that its about 99.9999% sure that I won't get pregnant when I take this thing out but if by some MIRACLE I do...God, I'm terrified. I want children desperately, I really do, and have thought for years that it was an impossibility.  

Why am I so conflicted? I'm excited to try for a baby, yet so utterly panicked and afraid because I feel lost. I mean, I know all about children, I've been around them my whole life and even worked with them but I never thought I'd have my own so...What in the hell am I supposed to know? 

I find myself stuck in what seems like the mindset of a 14 year old, scared to get pregnant. But most of all, I'm scared to try. I'm scared to face what might be years of trying and disappointment - not only to me, but to the man I love more than anything. I haven't ovulated since my early teens and yet only NOW do I feel like I'm beginning a journey of infertility.

Tw: my husband and I had a stillbirth Oct. 27th at 25 weeks no cause was ever found. I had no cycle after my loss but had a positive opk and temp jump leading me to believe I ovulated December 27. But what I thought was a new pregnancy is actually a tumor causing rising hcg levels. 15DPO hcg 170 progesterone 22.7 17DPO hcg 365. 19DPO (60hrs later) hcg 960. 20dpo hcg1208. Internal ultrasound showed no gestational sac but did show a heterogeneous structure that contains multiple cystic structures no fetal pole or hb. I was then informed that they believed I had a molar pregnancy. Didn't think it could get worse but it did. 

Worried about my hcg being too low for a molar I went to a different hospital for another opinion today. This is that the ultrasound showed:

""The anterior body of the uterus appears thickened and asymmetric when compared to the posterior body uterus. The echogenic endometrium is asymmetrically placed posteriorly in the uterus. This suggests some thickening in the anterior body of the uterus in the sunendometrial space (2.9x2.4 cm) or perhaps thickening of the endometrium however I suspect this is thickening in the sunendometrial space. There is a small 5mm cystic structure seen in the junction of this 2.9 cm hypoechoic region and the echogenic endometrium. Appearance raises the possibility of a sunendometrial cyst and adenomyosis. It is entirely possible that this small cyst is a gestation. I cannot however confirm with certainty a 'double decidual sac sign'. No other gestational sac is seen. Within the right ovary 1.8 cm cyst is seen. Right ovary measures 3.9 cm in length. Left ovary measures 2.4 cm in length and contains a 1cm cyst. No adnexal mass or free fluid is identified. 

Impression: clear cut gestational sac is not seen. I favor thickening of the myometrium anterior to the endometrium which raises the possibility of adenomyosis. I do not discretely identify a gestational sac. Otherwise no significant abnormality is seen.""

This might sound complicated/confusing, going to attempt to make it not be.. I'm 29, husband is 38, Weve been trying almost 2.5 years. We did 4 (back to back medicated) iuis last july-october. Ive never had any kind of positive.

Our main issue has been male factor infertility, his post wash sperm counts were generally 2mil-4mil. 

I also take thyroid medication and supplement with progesterone & estrogen in the 2WW.

In November my husband had varicocele surgery. The doctor was optimistic it would help because he said he had a lot of veins he took care of. 

Husband is supposed to be getting another SA next month. My thoughts were that we would see how his results were and when/if they got higher, we would try a few more IUIS.

I am now finding out that my back to back iuis were counted as 2 iuis each and so that means I'm at 7 or 8 out of 9 allowed with my insurance plan.

We pay out of pocket for our insurance. I can choose a new insurance that might restart me/give me more IUIS?, the issue would be that I could not go to the clinic I go to (which has higher reviews and I'm pretty happy with). 

If I stick with the insurance I have, I think I could still be monitored/given medications, just no actual IUI. 

After we did a few more IUIS, we were going to save up and maybe do IVF later this year (paying out of pocket).


QUESTION: Would you stick with the same insurance that only allows 1-2 more iuis OR get a new one that allowed you to try more IUIS but would force you to go to a clinic that is further away and/or has bad reviews.

We could also just choose a cheaper insurance (not cheaper by much but maybe $200 a month, might save us some money for IVF), try naturally for a few months, then do IVF. One issue I see with this is that I wouldnt be able to get meds prescribed from my doc to be supplemented (because my deductible would be too high to meet to go to an RE)

I am 33 years old and actually not currently TTC, living in beautiful BC :).  I have a history of 5 pregnancies; 1 resulting in a second trimester loss, 1 in a loss at around 8 weeks, and 3 chemical pregnancies.  
 
I had lots of testing done over the years and the only abnormalities have been an elevated homocysteine, elevated TPO antibodies, and recently a positive ANA.  I am on synthroid.  I worked with an RE a few years ago to work up the RPL, and my (f) partner at the time and I proceeded with donor IUI which resulted in a chemical pregnancy; I went on to do a known donor fresh ICI which had the same result.  As well as a few other cycles using a bank in WA state, etc.
 
Anyhow, long story short, after all that my partner and I split up and I am currently in a long term common-law relationship with a (m) partner.  I have had one pregnancy with him naturally, also resulting in a chemical.  To get his stats out of the way, he is mid thirties and proven fertility (strangely enough he has been a fresh/known donor for quite a few women, succesfully).  I currently have a mirena IUD for birth control (and won't be taking it out unless we make a decision based on the current labs and upcoming apt)
 
I recently had some hormone tests run, and my FSH came back at 9.8 which I was told is significant for my age, and have subsequently made an appointment with the RE I saw previously which is later this month.  This cycle, day 3 labs were repeated (but actually run on day 5 due to scheduling/lab hours) and came back with a very normal FSH of 5.1.  My estradiol was 305 pmol/l (~85 pg/ml) which falls within lab range but apparently is a bit elevated which may result in a falsley suppressed FSH?
 
Last month, my CD21 progesterone was also tested and 3.8 nmol/l (1.2 ng/ml)
 
Anyhow!  On one hand I feel I am making a mountain out of a molehill and over-reacting and on the other...well, I am super stressed by the thought that beyond the unexplained recurrent pregnancy losses, I may well have another barrier in my way.  My partner and I weren't intending to TTC for another year or so, but some of that will hinge on the results of this and whether time is ""of the essence"" or ...I'm paranoid :)  
 
Other small note is that my cycle has definitely gotten wonky in the last 2-3 years.  (both before and after IUD placement).  They range from 23-60+ day cycles.  I have not been doing BBT for this period of time, although I may for my own curiousity start to do so again.  Prior to all of this (2013 and earlier?) I had very regular cycles of 29-31 days with a predictable OV of CD14-15.  (verified by BBT, OPK's and on a few occasions progesterone testing during the luteal phase)

I know we all get salty when someone says &quot;just relax!&quot; but I swear to God, she&#39;s conceived exactly twice in the past 7 or 8 years (one birth, one MC) and <em>both</em> occurred the month after a vacation.  And I could really use a vacation, even if that isn&#39;t really a cure for IF.</p>

<p>If I don&#39;t miraculously conceive without the treatment my doctor recommends, I will be a minimum of 37 when I birth my first child.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, the higher-ups at BCBS can go suck a dick.  :P</p>

Hey everyone.  My wife and I have been trying for 2 and a half years with no luck.  About a year ago I was diagnosed with azoospermia after two semen samples with a zero count.  There were some other things like low PH and volume that I think might be trying to tell us something but so far all of the Dr's have shrugged that off.  My first urologist, after running some hormones samples etc said ""it's gene related, you should consider adoption or donor.""  Of course, he encouraged me to get a second opinion and referred us to a specialist.  The specialist was utterly useless as he didn't even deal with MFI.  This was all early to mid 2015.  In December I decided I wanted that second opinion.  This urologist could not locate my Vas Deferens when feeling around down there.  Now, I think I can find them just fine but i'm not trained to know what i'm feeling down there.  Maybe I'm just finding veins?  In any case, he suggested a kidney ultrasound because of the commonality of CAVD (congenital absence of the vas deferens) and renal agenisis (one kidney).  Kidney ultrasound showed normal, however I don't think that fully rules out CAVD.  The other thing it is associated with is Cystic Fibrosis.  I don't have any other really bad symptoms of CF aside from the fact that MFI is a symptom.  I do have some of the things associated with it like very salty sweat so I am wondering if that test might be worthwhile.  My thought is something like that would give us a good idea of whether it's genetic or not.  If we do find it is obstructive as opposed to genetic then there's a good chance a testicullar biopsy to recover some sperm may be worth while.  
I told my wife if the kidney ultrasound didn't turn up anything that we could move forward with the donor route so we have begun that process.

I guess my reason for posting here is wondering if anyone else has followed a similar path and what the results were.  Also, if anyone has ideas on something that maybe we haven't thought of yet. Thanks for any advice or thoughts you may be willing to share.

Everything is going well, we've gotten the hang of it - It's nether me nor my husband's idea of a good time, but no pain or bruising.

When we got our last batch of medication, however, the process took a turn for the worse. Painful injections, a lot of soreness, the whole nine yards. We had narrowed it down to around the time we got the new batch of syringes and needles, so we were suspecting a bad batch.

Here's what we figured out:

* Since the 23g needles are thinner, my husband had to push the plunger harder to make the fluid go through. this led to more hand shaking, and we're pretty sure that it's the shaking and lateral movement of the syringe that causes the pain and damage (since it causes the needle to move in the muscle, and that leads to tearing in the muscle)
* also, since the needle is thinner, and he was trying to go at the normal speed, the oil was shooting out of the syringe harder (like putting your finger over the mouth of a garden hose) which likely wasn't making things any better.

New to /infertility as we just got to our 1 year of trying for a baby with no luck so i officially have the infertile label. Our infertilaversary.... It sucks

For background - periods (light) about every 28 days. I am definitely ovulating. All bloods normal. Ultrasound i had last week said ovaries unremarkable, endometrium normal in appearance and thickness, uterus normal in size and echotexture. Partners sperm analysis was 'excellent' ( I asked the doctor if he said that to all the boys.. he laughed). We had a very early miscarriage 3 years ago, and i went on birth control after that.

This is the controversial (ish?) bit. In my teens and 20's i had 3 terminations. It was the best thing for me at the time, and i don't regret my decisions at that time. I was young, and I was stupid. (That being said, although I am not in any way religious, sometimes I think I am being punished...)  

I am 33 now

Could I have Asherman's syndrome? Could that be the reason I am not getting pregnant?  I feel like maybe if i go to my dr and ask her to refer me for a hysteroscopy on the basis that I had a termination then she will think I am bananas and have been reading too much WebMD. I can't be referred for IVF *yet* as I need to lose about 10kgs (22lbs) to qualify for treatment. I have already lost 12kg (25lbs). Should I just wait for the IVF referral and hope that they do a test then?
