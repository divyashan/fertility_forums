It took him a while to answer these from the original post (I had given up actually) but he just emailed me the answers! He's a busy man.    
    
Here is the original post https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/39f87l/announcement_ama_with_dr_jeffrey_braverman/    

Below are the Q & As.    
Here is is website for my info.
http://www.preventmiscarriage.com/


Question - I noticed on your website that your clinic does IVM, and I wondered if you could talk a bit about that, since it's not very common.
I've had one RE mention this to me as an option--as I understand it, it's normally used as a means of preventing over-stimulation, but he had mentioned that at one clinic where he studied, they were beginning to start using it for cases of DOR or under-responders to get more eggs. He did mention that it's relatively difficult to do, so a clinic very experienced in this process is extremely important.
Just wondering if you could comment on using IVM in general, and for DOR specifically, if that is something you have experience with.
I have a very, very low antral follicle count (varies from 0-3) and so I am looking for options for my Plan C, Plan D, etc.    

Dr. B Answer - Yes this technology does require an embryologist with experience in these types of cultures which we do have. It is a good choice and is being looked at for women with risk for OHSS such as PCOS, but work still needs to be done here. Most of the time we use it , it is for the unexpected retrieval of immature eggs in a cycle, and after maturing them it gives us more embryos to work with . Success does occur with IVF but generally not as high as when the egg is mature to start. We did have a patient who only made GV eggs not even making it to first stage of maturity and failed at another major NY center. We retrieved these GV eggs on this patient matured them and she went on to have her first pregnancy and first baby.    

Question -  We don't really have a sub-specialty of Reproductive Endocrinology here in the UK, let alone one of Reproductive Immunology. What do you think the UK could learn from a US model of treatment?
A 2007 Cochrane review on immunotherapies for recurrent miscarriage concluded there was no evidence of benefit for various immunotherapies over placebo, including paternal cell immunization, third party donor leukocytes immunization, trophoblast membrane infusion and intravenous immunoglobulin infusion.http://www.hfea.gov.uk/docs/SCAG_reproductive_immunology_annex_cochrane_Nov07.pdf[1] Yet IVIg infusion, TNF-a blocking agents (e.g. Humira) and low-dose steroids seem to be growing in popularity. What would you say to NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) to convince them to rethink their guidelines for fertility treatment in the NHS?    

Dr. B Answer - National Institute for Clinical Excellence) to convince them to rethink their guidelines for fertility treatment in the NHS?(there are many issues to discuss here, some are that the reviews are correct i.e. LIT is not effective because the mechanism of action was never really understood. Introduction of paternal antigen is best tolerized on mucosal surfaces not through the skin  and mucosal interaction happens  every time a patient has relations. The only benefit we have seen is with donor LIT when there is a lack of class 2 mismatching that requires the introduction of foreign class 2 HLA as has been done successfully on some organ donations in immune privileged sites of which the uterus is one of them(see our website and abstract on HLA disparity for a more detailed explanation)
The conclusions on IVIG are based on studies that were done by doctors without any background in immunology so the patient selection was all wrong. Many of these studies eliminated the patients that most needed the therapy , newer more narrow studies have shown benefit of IVIG as has our experience. It is similar to giving an autoimmune treatment to all patients with symptoms of autoimmune disease without first documenting they have autoimmune disease then without documenting which autoimmune disease they have. This has been the focus of our work and why our success rates for so many categories of pregnancy failure are so high (most around 80%). It is hard to publish studies on success rates which should be the next question i.e. why haven't we published our success. the reason is that studies require double blinded placebo studies using single therapy . None of our patients of course with a long history of losses would want to be in placebo group and we use multiple therapies most of the time making it hard to prove success of any single therapy. However our overall success rates (list on my stie) show that our therapies work. It would be 10 years before we could accumulate enough double blinded data and so many women that could have a child with our knowledge and therapy would not have the chance at treatment currently.     

Question - What are some of the markers or signs that an undiagnosed autoimmune issue may be at play beyond (obviously) not getting/staying pregnant? What are the flags that things require more investigation? Is family history a predictor?
I'm asking as I have family members with things like chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and some endocrine disorders. I don't know if something like that might be impacting my fertility without me realizing it.    

Dr. B Answer - The signs for autoimmune issues that can affect pregnancy are not different than the signs for autoimmune disease itself(and I do put chronic faigue and fibromyalgia in that category), as many of the immune issues affecting pregnancy are yet undiagnosed autoimmune issues. Family history is critical as the predispositions to autoimmune disease are inheretid and one of the reasons we do a thorough HLA analysis (see our sample reports on the website.    

Question - My question is: When do you recommend additional immunology testing, beyond the standard RPL panel? Our only known issue is MFI, and I have 50% implantation (total of 8 untested embryos transferred), yet we can't get them to stick around for more than a couple weeks. Could this be immune-related?    

Dr. B Answer -  Yes of course, remember the ""standard"" RPL panel at best tests for a few antibodies and does not look at the complete immune system as we do(see our website for our complete testing panel and how we analyze this data)
    
Question - In unexplained infertility is there a reason to do a lap to check for endometriosis if there are no symptoms? How often do you see asymptomatic endo?    

Dr. B Answer - Yes many patients have endometriosis with no symptoms and I think it affects fertility by affecting both egg quality and immune rejection , as the cause of endometriosis is usually underlying autoimmune issues. (see my website on silent endometriosis and CRAMS)    

Question - Hi, Dr Braverman!
Thank you so much for being willing to answer some questions for us all over at /r/infertility ! This is an amazing opportunity for a lot of us to learn more. :)
My question, inevitably, stems from my personal situation, but I'll try to generalize it, for maximum applicability to others. :)
In cases of consistent ""idiopathic"" RPL that occurs after a successful pregnancy, particularly with early to very early losses, how often have you found the root cause to be immunologic, as opposed to non-immune factors, e.g., aneuploidy?    

Dr. B Answer -  I think in secondary RPL there are many issues to look at i.e. sex of the first born, family history of autoimmune disease etc.  Many cases of secondary RPL have autoimmune issues and they can also be the cause of aneuploidy(see my CRAMS blog).     

Question - This may not be germane to the immunology topic but here's where my head's at lately: In situations where a couple has done one round of IVF without success (specifically, chemical pregnancy with a PGS normal embryo, where the embryos were described as ""slow"" but the only known fertility issue is MFI), what are the next steps you would have the patient take? Additional testing, lifestyle changes, etc.?     

Dr. B Answer - Again here i would look for any issues other than male factor that may affect egg quality (see CRAMS blog) , if none found I would focus on treating the male factor component. remember with mitochondrial dysfunction , even PGS normal embryos fail.     

Question -  What role, if any, do autoimmune diseases play in a couple's chances of success? I am a 30 year old female and have had rheumatoid arthritis since childhood. My labs have so far all come back normal. Could the inflammation in my body or my incredibly dumb immune system have anything to do with our year of trying with no success?    

Dr. B Answer - Yes , remember it is important to see what tests you have had, RA patients in our practice have been found to have extremely elevated serum cytokine levels that affect the ability of the maternal immune system to generate tolerance for paternal genetics. These types of immune testing are rarely if ever performed at a Rheumatologist office and many have called us impressed with this type of workup.     

Question - As an add on to the question above, An add-on to this: At what point should any generalized autoimmune condition (Graves/Hashimotos, Lupus, RA, ect) be investigated further as it related to infertility? My endocrinologist has worked with many pregnant patients with Graves, for example, so clearly many of them had no reproductive issues.    

Dr. B Answer - Yes the time to investigate is when they begin to show signs of failed immune tolerance to paternal genetics, i.e. RPL , failed transfer of quality embryos , PGS tested embryos and lets not forget that many REs do not follow patients like this into their pregnancies where the immune issues if untreated lead to a higher risk of 3rd trimester complications(read our blog on this topic)    

Question -  Individuals with known autoimmune diseases like myself (with Hashimotos) who have yet to be able to conceive, what questions should we ask our RE's, and tests should we ask for? What is our focus - lower antibodies to a certain point, focus on sex hormones, supplementation etc?    

Dr. B Answer -  This is quite a complex question and not as simple as recommending a few things. Our analysis looks at so much of the immune system and treatments are tailored to both the diagnosis and the immune abnormalities that we find. You really cant direct an RE to test these , so my advice is they should just refer them to us and we will work with them to diagnose and treat together.

Just wanted to let everyone know that we did have a D&C on Thursday. I meant to post this earlier but needed to take a break from here and get my thoughts together.  Physically I feel fine and I'm glad it's over.  We were given the option to let it happen naturally, but since Mr. Kitteh is on a work trip from today through Wed. or Thurs. of this week, we decided a D&C would be the best option.  I didn't want to go through a natural miscarriage all by myself, especially if something went wrong.  

We did decide to get the ""products of conception"" tested. I'm slightly concerned about how much it's going to cost, but for now I'm trying not to think about that (I already called the insurance company and know for a fact it's not covered).  My RE is willing to talk additional testing but wants to wait until we get the fetal tissue test results back.  As most of you already know, our embryo was PGS normal, but my RE still suspects that there was something wrong with it that caused the miscarriage.  As I am bitterly learning, PGS isn't perfect.  

My RE otherwise hasn't had a lot of answers for us.  She's basically told us ""10 percent of PGS embryo pregnancies end in miscarriage and we don't know why.  I wish we did but we don't.  It shouldn't happen again and you were probably just the victim of bad luck.""  I find this answer hard to accept but she is probably right. Regardless I still think I'm going to push for the RPL panel because the thought of going through this again makes me physically ill.  RPL testing, of course, is no guarantee of anything, but who knows, maybe they'll find something that will actually make a difference next time around.

Emotionally I am just trying to take things day by day, hour by hour.  I am counting down the seconds until Christmas is over.  My husband wants us to visit our hometown for New Year's but I'm not sure I'm up to it.  Seeing my husband play with our young niece is like a knife in the heart right now.  I'm hoping someday I'll be able to handle it, but for now, I can't.  I also know my Mom will want an update on ""Project Baby"" and I don't know what to tell her.  I honestly have nothing good to say about this process right now and I have no hope that it will ever work.  I don't want to take hope away from my Mom, though, that just seems cruel.  

Anyway, I'd just like to say THANK YOU to everyone here for all of the support you have given me over the past couple of weeks as this nightmare has unfolded.  You are all amazing and wonderful and I consider myself incredibly lucky to have had this kind of support while going through this.

Just wanted to let everyone know that we did have a D&amp;C on Thursday. I meant to post this earlier but needed to take a break from here and get my thoughts together.

I have stage 4 endo and so probably the only way I can get pregnant is through IVF. Unfortunately, my husband also has fertility issues. He is subfertile, most likely due to his celiac disease. Since we need IVF anyway, his fertility issues haven't affected our approach until the embyologist had to decide on whether to use ICSI or not. The ICSI embyos were much more successful and the process was only used because my husband's sample was so poor. My husband was horrified because he didn't understand that he was subfertile.

All of his semen analysis came back saying the same thing, that his motility and morphology were poor. However it was never made clear to him that this was actually an issue. I understood because I knew what all the numbers meant, however, it was never spelled out to him. I never used the word subfertile with him because I didn't want to hurt his feelings but I thought he understood.

It didn't matter to the doctor so much that he was subfertile because it didn't change their treatment plan for me. But  now my husband is in shock and grieving, and I think he's feeling betrayed. I think this only happened because of an inherent  gender bias within the infertility world.

Even though my husband has issues as well, he's not expected to come in for regular blood tests and ultrasounds, or even expected to speak with the doctor. He's not expected to follow any dietary regimen or change his daily habits. When I asked him to stop drinking to improve his sperm quality he didn't take it seriously. Now he takes it seriously but only after having it shoved in his face that his sperm quality was questionable.

Its not that my husband isn't to blame at all for not understanding (he's a problem avoider) however, I think it's a product of how men are involved in this whole process whether it's due to female infertility, male fertility, or both.

Couldn't RE's just do something simple like set up a meeting with the partner to discuss lifestyle and dietary changes? Has anyone else felt like this or had a similar experience?

Tdrl: My husband didn't understand that he is subfertile until now and I think it's because of a gender bias in the fertility world.

22,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,

I'm on the hunt for any studies that demonstrate the effect of Gonapeptyl depot (triptorelin) injections on endometriosis so that I can try to make a sensible decision about IVF.

Quick background: I have stage IV endometriosis that regrows quickly after surgery. I am part way though my 1st IVF cycle with one embryo to transfer. My fertility consultant has recommended a 12 week course of Gonapeptyl before ET. I understand that this is supposed to reduce 'endometriosis inflammation' and consequently increase the chances of implantation.

I've had the 1st depot injection and the side-effects I'm experiencing are debilitating. It goes without saying that I would do whatever it takes for the chance of a successful pregnancy. However, I feel that 3 months of physical stress - inc. racing heart/tachycardia, extreme nausea and vomiting (so poor diet), as well as endocrine disruption - may well cancel out any benefits.

At the moment, I don't have anywhere near enough information to make a reliable, informed decision.

There seem to be many sources that provide an overview of how Gonapeptyl (or other GnRH agonists) suppress oestrogen production, and that state that reduced oestrogen starves endometrial tissue. However, I can't find any substantial quantitative or qualitative results!

Does anybody know of any published papers or articles that would cover this? Any suggestions or links would be amazing.

Thanks so much for reading

We are both very active and fit. We got pregnant in 2005 and had a D&C at 6 weeks. We were not trying at the time (ugh, I know), so once I was healed I had the Paragard IUD inserted. I had normal menstruation and didn't really have any problems with it. I finally had it removed after just shy of 9 years in October 2013. I then went on the pill until April 2014 and we started actively trying in June of that year.

Since coming off birth control (Paragard and then pills), my menstrual flow has been extremely short and light. It generally starts in the morning and I am able to get through the day with a panty liner. Often by the end of that first day, I am just spotting. I will sometimes spot on days 2 and 3 as well, but it is very, very little.

I have been tracking this entire time and know that I ovulate based on temperature shifts and LH tests. I've been to an RE and all bloodwork, including estrogen, has been completely normal. ETA: An HSG was also normal. They are aware of my short/light flow. I had my first ultrasound with them at 12 DPO since I was in the office anyway (my luteal phase is usually 13 days) and my lining then was 6.2 mm. He seemed unconcerned by this and told us to keep trying. It hadn't yet been a year at that point, so we were fine with continuing without intervention.

During the cycle I had the HSG, at about the year mark, I had an unusually clotty period that showed up a bit later than normal. I decided to take a pregnancy test and sure enough, it was positive. I didn't let myself get excited because I knew it presented like a chemical pregancy given the clotting. The test was lighter the next day and completely negative the next.

The RE diagnosed us with unexplained infertility and recommended a monitored Clomid/Ovidrel cycle even though I am already ovulating. I am currently going through that for the first time. I had an ultrasound on day 3 and the lining was 3 mm. I took Clomid 50 mg days 4-8. On day 12, I went in for another and the RE said my lining looked ""fine"" though she didn't give me a number. I had nice follicles. I was to trigger that evening and did so. I ovulated this past Saturday. I had amazing fertility signs for the first time from the Clomid (3 days of EWCM when I never get any), so I was feeling positive.

This morning, the scans from my day 12 ultrasound were loaded into my electronic profile and I took a peek at them (there's usually a lag). The measure for my lining was written in the scans. It was 5.2 mm.

I am a librarian. My job is to tell students to trust experts, only use peer-reviewed sources, stay away from junky web sites. I am trying very, very hard to do the same with these experts I am entrusting with my fertility. They have medical degrees and work at an Ivy League university practice.

But at the same time, I know research informs practice, and many fertility clinic web sites I've read say that optimal lining is at least 8 mm for implantation. These doctors would not agree that my 5.2 mm lining looked ""fine.""

So, I'm at a loss. Do I push myself to continue to trust them? Do I trust myself and get a second opinion? What would you do?

I went from 27 7dp5dt to 48 9dp5dt (doubling time = 58 hours) to 82 12dp5dt (doubling time = 93 hours) to ~93 14dp5dt.  RE instructed me to stop all meds, and I'm going in tomorrow for an ultrasound to check for an ectopic. :(

Any insights or suggestions for questions for the RE are appreciated.  I haven't had a normal period since February (since then, I've had a chemical, pregnancy until 11 weeks, miscarriage and D&C, IVF retrieval, a few cancelled cycles, and finally this FET, all back-to-back), so I'm curious whether it'd be better to wait at least one full cycle for my body to calm down a bit before FET #2, or if my body is geared up for a pregnancy somehow and it's better to proceed right away.  

I also regret returning to work during my TWW (transfer was on a Wed; I worked from home the following Monday and returned to the office on Tuesday).  It was a really stressful and busy week, so for FET #2, I'm going to use vacation time and just kick back through the whole TWW.  Might not actually make a difference, but it'll make me feel better.

**UPDATE:** Ultrasound was inconclusive today.  Doesn't look ectopic but can't be definitively ruled out either.  I should be 5w1d but nothing is visible at all on the ultrasound (which makes sense given my low betas).  And my beta went up to 127 since yesterday's ~93, which is odd -- actually went up 50% overnight, which is its biggest jump in a while.  They're going to keep monitoring my betas to make sure it starts going down.  RE did recommend taking a full cycle off for my body to recover (plus any additional time I need before I feel fully ready to start a new protocol), and she'll run the panel of tests again and do another hysteroscopy all once my beta zeroes back out.

So I've got a request for a first appointment with a counselor I found on the Resolve website. My husband and I are no strangers to counseling. Since we were both divorced (and I have a little ""condition""), we sought out counseling preemptively when we first thought we may want to get married. She's been wonderful! She helped me communicate better and our relationship is stronger for it. We went from seeing her every month, to now only about 4 times a year. However, only in our last session with her has our struggles with infertility come out. I could tell right away it was uncharted territory for her. So, we're seeking another counselor with experience.

A bit of background: When I was 15, I was raped and became pregnant for the first time. I miscarried at 3 months. When I was 17, I became pregnant by my (then) boyfriend and became pregnant, and miscarried at 2 months. When I was 19, I was raped by a boyfriend and became pregnant, and carried my daughter to term. In an attempt to raise my daughter with her father, I stayed with him and became pregnant again at 20. I miscarried this child at 3 months. I left this boyfriend. I started dating another guy and got pregnant by him.

Because of my previous history of miscarriages, I wanted to keep this baby. However, my (then) boyfriend threatened to kill me, my daughter, and himself if I didn't abort or give up this baby for adoption. I went to the police and they essentially told me that until he attempted something, they couldn't do anything. I ended up giving up this baby, a son, for adoption. Because of my past history with miscarriages and pregnancy issues, I got my tubes tied (clips). I became massively depressed and broke up with this guy. The issue with miscarriages came from, according to my doctor, a tilted uterus, severe cervical and uterine scarring, and endometriosis.

A few months later, I started dating a friend that I'd had since before I got pregnant with my daughter. We've been married for close to five years now. Before we ever got married we both made it clear that we both wanted children, he made it clear that he wanted biological children in addition to my daughter, which he claims as his own.

About two years ago, we saved up the money to get my clips removed. We've been actively trying to conceive since I healed from my surgery and have not had any luck with implantation. We considered a surrogate or IVF, but we both feel that we'd like for everything to be relatively natural. We've charted, taken temperatures, all of the natural stuff and nothing is working. 

His aversion to IVF and surrogacy is due to his somewhat distrust for doctors and medicine. We both know that doctors can't make set in stone promises, but after two different doctors guaranteed that they could get his parents cancer into remission and his parents dying not long after, he's skeptical (He's not antivax or anti-medicine or anything like that, he's just skeptical of promises made by doctors.)

My husband hasn't taken this well. He's expressed since before we were married that he wants a son or a daughter to carry the family name and our genetics, and I agree with him. He comes from a family of 6 sisters, and he is the only son.

In the past several months, though, he's become pretty depressed. He gets drunk 3 or 4 nights per week, he stays late at work (we work at the same place and there's no specific reason he stays late as he's caught up on his work), he goes out fishing with our daughter or to our friend's house when he's not drinking, and he stays up until 3 or 4 AM playing games or is on the computer, or whatever. He, 6'5"" and went from 240 lbs and fit (working out all the time) to 150 and skinny. I don't mind this as long as he's healthy, but it's gotta be because he's depressed.

I know that he's not cheating, because when I thought he was I'd call work, or text my friends and his alibi checked out. When he goes fishing, he always brings back fish. I just wanted to dispel that.

We have had 2 therapy sessions and he sort of dismisses them. He walked out of the one we had yesterday because ""going to therapy isn't going to help you get pregnant.""

I don't know what to do, or what to recommend him to do. I love my husband and he's a great spouse and a great father. I'm at a loss, guys, what can I do?

Additional information: He's had a sperm test about a month ago -- motility is fine and his count is in the 340M/ml range. 


Tldr: I can't get pregnant, husband desperately wants a child, he's become extremely distant and seemingly depressed.

63,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello IF community! I have been lurking for a little bit and decided to make an intro of sorts and have some questions for you wise ones.

Husband (32) and I (31) have been TTC for about a year now, and have been seeing an RE going on 3 months. I have been expecting this journey for several years as I was surgically diagnosed with Stage IV endo about 10 years ago. This happened by pure coincidence as I was having a LAP done for ovarian cysts when the endo was spotted. At that time, we were nowhere near ready for kids, but I still wanted to be proactive so I started seeking out RE's. Not surprisingly, only 1 wanted anything to do with me since we were not looking to get pregnant immediately. At about the same time, I was between insurance coverage and said RE was adamant about pursuing at least one more LAP (new cysts began growing) knowing it was all OOP for me. For this and other reasons, I stopped seeing this RE and went back to my OBGYN as my primary source for endo & cyst treatment. We monitored cysts with transvaginal ultrasound, and managed pain symptoms with medication and BCP combo. Over the course of a few years, a couple of cysts ruptured, and I even tried one round of Lupron Depot. I had a very strong, negative reaction to this drug so my OBGYN refused to give me a second round, and we started the BCP plan again. All was managable until then-boyfriend/now-husband got married and decided we were ready to start trying.

Fast forward to April 2014 when I broached the subject of ""my options"" with my OB-GYN regarding getting off BCP and TTC. Side note: This OBGYN was one of the surgeons during my LAP; the other surgeon was my then-OBGYN but moved out of state around 2013 so I transferred to above mentioned OBGYN because she was in the same clinic, and I have seen her before. Husband and I decide to start actively trying in the winter of 2014/2015. I started 2015 with an HSG and it came back all clear. I started to monitored my BBT and CM, and planned sex to coincide with expected ovulation. I did not use OPKs at that time, for whatever reason (most likely stubbornness).

By August 2015, I went back to my OBGYN to discuss progress, or lack thereof. We recount the surgical notes of my nearly decade old LAP, and discuss the hypothetics of my disease progression, and that an RE would be the best bet. She is hesitant to do another LAP and clear out the mounting scar tissue since an invasive procedure will surely produce more scar tissue. I truly appreciate her non-invasive approach. During this same visit, she also informs me that the clinic is no longer doing OB, just gynecology. Mind you I started going to this clinic in my early teens, and I am not thrilled in finding an OB especially since the others have literally been inside me like no one else. 

We were lucky to have been recommended to one of the top RE's in our metro area, and that he accepts our insurance. At first RE consult, we discuss all viable options and get bloodwork and SA done. Husband's SA is fantastic aside from 3% morphology. Density, viability, and motility are great, so we're thankful that I am the only one with a hurdle. My bloodwork takes some time, and my consult was perfectly timed a few days before CD10 so we were quick with ultrasounds and begin monitoring follicular growth. Bloodwork comes back 'abnormal' so a 2nd set is ordered. Because I forgot to do my CD2/3 estradiol, RE wants to wait to go over bloodwork results with me, so that he can be comprehensive in his discussion. During this time, we do a second round of u/s, follicles are growing a bit more slowly than the first round, but they are growing still. Both first and second round show immediate hemorrhage of the corpus luteum and ovulation cannot be detected or guaranteed. Tech told me this was normal. Is it? 

2nd bloodwork also comes back abnormal - lupus anticoags detected, elevated B2glycos, and slightly elevated cardiolipin IGG & IGM. I was told that if we were to conceive, to ""immediately contact the RE to start treatment"". She was intentionally vague, and I was hesitant to ask any questions. 

I still have not had a formal consult to discuss the implications of my bloodwork since I have not completed my CD2/3 estradiol; CD1 should be tomorrow so that bloodwork will be done soon. Husband was out of town during this cycle's ovulation - follicles grew too slowly and I ovulated a week later than expected, his trip was already planned and I could not travel with him - so I am not expecting a pregnancy this month.

Husband has been incredibly patient and is trying to understand my mix of emotions through all of this. He has expressed that he is saddened that his tests came back normal, because then this puts all of the pressure on me. He isn't too keen on me following this subreddit, because he does not want me to become overly worrisome/emotional/all the crazy things you become when you are TTC and it isn't working. This comes from a good place in him.

I do have a few friends in the IF community, but in the couple of times we have discussed this with them the other women try turn it into a competition of sorts and it gets very uncomfortable. I hope an anonymous platform will bring valuable insight.

We are looking to start our first IUI in the next month or two, and I am seeking out any information that could be useful for this next step in our journey:

- Questions I should prepare for our RE regarding bloodwork consult and the IUI process?
- Any research I can do on my own that is useful?

Sorry for long post, just want to be thorough. Thank you again, and good luck in your TTC journey!",t2_sqa0z,False,,0,False,Intro & Looking for Guidance,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_3wtexx,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1450147284.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello IF community! I have been lurking for a little bit and decided to make an intro of sorts and have some questions for you wise ones.</p>

<p>Husband (32) and I (31) have been TTC for about a year now, and have been seeing an RE going on 3 months. I have been expecting this journey for several years as I was surgically diagnosed with Stage IV endo about 10 years ago. This happened by pure coincidence as I was having a LAP done for ovarian cysts when the endo was spotted. At that time, we were nowhere near ready for kids, but I still wanted to be proactive so I started seeking out RE&#39;s. Not surprisingly, only 1 wanted anything to do with me since we were not looking to get pregnant immediately. At about the same time, I was between insurance coverage and said RE was adamant about pursuing at least one more LAP (new cysts began growing) knowing it was all OOP for me. For this and other reasons, I stopped seeing this RE and went back to my OBGYN as my primary source for endo &amp; cyst treatment. We monitored cysts with transvaginal ultrasound, and managed pain symptoms with medication and BCP combo. Over the course of a few years, a couple of cysts ruptured, and I even tried one round of Lupron Depot. I had a very strong, negative reaction to this drug so my OBGYN refused to give me a second round, and we started the BCP plan again. All was managable until then-boyfriend/now-husband got married and decided we were ready to start trying.</p>

<p>Fast forward to April 2014 when I broached the subject of &quot;my options&quot; with my OB-GYN regarding getting off BCP and TTC. Side note: This OBGYN was one of the surgeons during my LAP; the other surgeon was my then-OBGYN but moved out of state around 2013 so I transferred to above mentioned OBGYN because she was in the same clinic, and I have seen her before. Husband and I decide to start actively trying in the winter of 2014/2015. I started 2015 with an HSG and it came back all clear. I started to monitored my BBT and CM, and planned sex to coincide with expected ovulation. I did not use OPKs at that time, for whatever reason (most likely stubbornness).</p>

<p>By August 2015, I went back to my OBGYN to discuss progress, or lack thereof. We recount the surgical notes of my nearly decade old LAP, and discuss the hypothetics of my disease progression, and that an RE would be the best bet. She is hesitant to do another LAP and clear out the mounting scar tissue since an invasive procedure will surely produce more scar tissue. I truly appreciate her non-invasive approach. During this same visit, she also informs me that the clinic is no longer doing OB, just gynecology. Mind you I started going to this clinic in my early teens, and I am not thrilled in finding an OB especially since the others have literally been inside me like no one else. </p>

<p>We were lucky to have been recommended to one of the top RE&#39;s in our metro area, and that he accepts our insurance. At first RE consult, we discuss all viable options and get bloodwork and SA done. Husband&#39;s SA is fantastic aside from 3% morphology. Density, viability, and motility are great, so we&#39;re thankful that I am the only one with a hurdle. My bloodwork takes some time, and my consult was perfectly timed a few days before CD10 so we were quick with ultrasounds and begin monitoring follicular growth. Bloodwork comes back &#39;abnormal&#39; so a 2nd set is ordered. Because I forgot to do my CD2/3 estradiol, RE wants to wait to go over bloodwork results with me, so that he can be comprehensive in his discussion. During this time, we do a second round of <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a>, follicles are growing a bit more slowly than the first round, but they are growing still. Both first and second round show immediate hemorrhage of the corpus luteum and ovulation cannot be detected or guaranteed. Tech told me this was normal. Is it? </p>

<p>2nd bloodwork also comes back abnormal - lupus anticoags detected, elevated B2glycos, and slightly elevated cardiolipin IGG &amp; IGM. I was told that if we were to conceive, to &quot;immediately contact the RE to start treatment&quot;. She was intentionally vague, and I was hesitant to ask any questions. </p>

<p>I still have not had a formal consult to discuss the implications of my bloodwork since I have not completed my CD2/3 estradiol; CD1 should be tomorrow so that bloodwork will be done soon. Husband was out of town during this cycle&#39;s ovulation - follicles grew too slowly and I ovulated a week later than expected, his trip was already planned and I could not travel with him - so I am not expecting a pregnancy this month.</p>

<p>Husband has been incredibly patient and is trying to understand my mix of emotions through all of this. He has expressed that he is saddened that his tests came back normal, because then this puts all of the pressure on me. He isn&#39;t too keen on me following this subreddit, because he does not want me to become overly worrisome/emotional/all the crazy things you become when you are TTC and it isn&#39;t working. This comes from a good place in him.</p>

<p>I do have a few friends in the IF community, but in the couple of times we have discussed this with them the other women try turn it into a competition of sorts and it gets very uncomfortable. I hope an anonymous platform will bring valuable insight.</p>

<p>We are looking to start our first IUI in the next month or two, and I am seeking out any information that could be useful for this next step in our journey:</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions I should prepare for our RE regarding bloodwork consult and the IUI process?</li>
<li>Any research I can do on my own that is useful?</li>
<li>Anyone else have the same hemorrhagic behavior? I understand the corpus hemorrhagicum is normal before it develops into the corpus luteum, but is this something different? </li>
<li>Anyone have similar labwork? Or anyone with some scientific background have insight? </li>
<li>Anything you have learned after the fact that would have been helpful at this state of the journey?</li>
</ul>

76,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello from NM, USA. Great to discover this subreddit. My wife is 31 years old, I'm 33 years old. Trying to conceive from the beginning of 2012. 

In 2013 we discovered my wife had an under-active thyroid so she started taking levothryoxine (which took a while to stabilize). I had a semen analysis which came back with a 3% healthy morphology but otherwise OK.

In Jan 2015 we started working with a fertility clinic (""The Center for Reproductive Medicine"", ABQ). Since then we have had 4 unsuccessful IUIs. My wife was perscribed 50mg Clomid and reacted quite well, with 1 to 6 mature follicles. We took no other drugs. I have had several semen analyses performed this year and they all came back healthy, including the morphology. 

Every examination of my wife has come back positive. There are no indications as to what the cause of infertility may be. Tubes are clear, lining is good. My wife's cycle has never skipped a beat, she is like clockwork every single 26 days. Our RE is not concerned with the unexplained cause of infertility and suggested possible endometriosis, however from what they have told us, it is neither worth diagnosing or attempting to treat. 

On guidance from our RE we are about to start IVF with PGSD and ICSI, we are paying OOP. We were prescribed Gonal-F & Menopur and plan to order them from IVFMeds.com (several other drugs will come from Freedom Pharmacy). I am awaiting the results of a semen HALO test, but the timing of everything means we need to order the drugs before I hear the result.

Great to discover this subreddit. My wife is 31 years old, I&#39;m 33 years old. Trying to conceive from the beginning of 2012. </p>

<p>In 2013 we discovered my wife had an under-active thyroid so she started taking levothryoxine (which took a while to stabilize). I had a semen analysis which came back with a 3% healthy morphology but otherwise OK.</p>

<p>In Jan 2015 we started working with a fertility clinic (&quot;The Center for Reproductive Medicine&quot;, ABQ). Since then we have had 4 unsuccessful IUIs. My wife was perscribed 50mg Clomid and reacted quite well, with 1 to 6 mature follicles. We took no other drugs. I have had several semen analyses performed this year and they all came back healthy, including the morphology. </p>

<p>Every examination of my wife has come back positive. There are no indications as to what the cause of infertility may be. Tubes are clear, lining is good. My wife&#39;s cycle has never skipped a beat, she is like clockwork every single 26 days. Our RE is not concerned with the unexplained cause of infertility and suggested possible endometriosis, however from what they have told us, it is neither worth diagnosing or attempting to treat. </p>

<p>On guidance from our RE we are about to start IVF with PGSD and ICSI, we are paying OOP. We were prescribed Gonal-F &amp; Menopur and plan to order them from IVFMeds.com (several other drugs will come from Freedom Pharmacy). I am awaiting the results of a semen HALO test, but the timing of everything means we need to order the drugs before I hear the result. With ICSI perhaps it doesn&#39;t make any difference what the result is?</p>

<p>Compared to the technical data others have provided I feel like we are quite uninformed. I would greatly appreciate any insight, input, questions and suggestions other Redditors might have.</p>

A short history to introduce myself (as I think I've put it off long enough). Please forgive the long hand because I haven't quite picked up on all the acronyms yet! 

I am 29, and have been ttc for almost three years now. I ovulate regularly, and do not have endo or pcos. After our first year of unsuccessful ttc, we had basic screenings done. Hubby's SA came back completely normal, and my blood testing came back normal in FSH and estrogen, but quite low in progesterone. Doc put me through 3 rounds of clomid with progesterone. 

At this point I went a little off the rails. I went to college and graduated with a human biology degree and chemistry degree fully intending to become an Ob/gyn doc back when I was 22. I decided that being a doc wasn't in the cards for me, but it became important when this struggle came to be. I am fascinated by reproductive and overall health and have a pretty solid background, so I began to do some digging, research, and eventually experimentation. It's also worth noting that I live in the US, so the second anything in my medical chart said infertility, hubby and I had to pay out of pocket. 

So partially as a cost saving method, partially as my own experiment, and partially as a mechanism for avoidance of the issue, I went to a naturopath who claimed a 100% success rate. It was a joke, but I did lose weight so yay!  Ha! Did that for a year. 

Finally went back to my Ob/gyn and did the tasting I'd been avoiding and got back on clomid. Had an hsg treat and transvaginal ultrasound. Tubes are open, but uterus is slightly arcuate, which my doc was quick to dismiss as trivial. Just did femara for this cycle and will never touch that demon drug again.  

So basically I'm right back at square one and annoyed about it. Undiagnosed and annoyed. I basically have no answers and am not sure where to go to find them, hence lurking on this board for a while.

At that point I gave up, I was on the donor embryo waiting list but I know that the chances of that happening are low.  Donor egg was out of my reach financially and emotionally I was exhausted. I worked towards moving forward being single and childless.  It has been a rough year.

My provincial government announced this fall that it would cover one round of IVF retrieval and all the subsequent implantations This would also include the medical costs of known donor eggs.  In other words a lot of the costs are gone, a baby is back on the table for me.

Somehow I can't move forward, Deep down I want a baby but knowing the emotional toll this is going to take is holding me back.  As a single person I go this alone. My family is mildly supportive, mildly.  Needless to say I haven't told many people about this part of my life.

I was told they didn&#39;t recommend I&#39;ve but we could try one round, otherwise I need to move on to donor egg.</p>

<p>At that point I gave up, I was on the donor embryo waiting list but I know that the chances of that happening are low.  Donor egg was out of my reach financially and emotionally I was exhausted. I worked towards moving forward being single and childless.  It has been a rough year.</p>

<p>My provincial government announced this fall that it would cover one round of IVF retrieval and all the subsequent implantations This would also include the medical costs of known donor eggs.  In other words a lot of the costs are gone, a baby is back on the table for me.</p>

<p>Somehow I can&#39;t move forward, Deep down I want a baby but knowing the emotional toll this is going to take is holding me back.  As a single person I go this alone. My family is mildly supportive, mildly.  Needless to say I haven&#39;t told many people about this part of my life.        I am part of a single moms by choice group but even that is hard as no one else is facing infertility. </p>

<p>How do you find the strength to move forward? What things do you focus on to keep you going?   </p>

One of our only childless couple friends just announced on Facebook that they're expecting. They're roughly the same age as my husband and I, have been married about the same length of time, but never seemed interested in having kids because they're both very busy working professionals. When I saw the announcement I was hit with an intense wave of jealousy, sadness, and so many other emotions. I hate feeling like this every time someone announces a pregnancy. I want desperately to celebrate with them and be happy for them, but it's getting more and more difficult for me to get my head into that space. 

We've been trying for almost 10 years now.

Last month we did another round of clomid with a follicle scan (mature follicles on both ovaries) and trigger shot, but my period started right on time and here I am. Still with out hope and full of hope all at the same time.

Becoming pregnant feels like a total pipe dream right now. A complete fantasy. I feel, especially on days like this, that there is no hope for us. And yet every cycle it all comes rushing back during the two week wait, just so it can be crushed again when the first signs of my period appear. I hate hoping and dreaming, but I can't seem to control it. 

The only bright spot in my journey right now is that I was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism, so the treatment for that is only just starting to take effect and could positively affect my fertility. It's possible that it has my thyroid causing the issues all along, but I suspect there's more to it than that. I just hate not knowing for sure.

I've been lurking on Reddit for about 7 years but never made an account or posted until today.  I think I'm mostly doing this so that maybe I'll finally cry.  So far it's working.

**TL;DR** I'm a mid-20s female, Husband is mid-20s male.  I was diagnosed with PCOS at 16.  Husband was just told over the past few months that he has (severe?) sperm problems.  We've been exploring both adoption and IVF.  

**A brief history of time:**

October, 2014: Visit OB/GYN, get put on Metformin and prenatals.

January-March, 2015: 3 cycles of unmonitored Femara 2.5 mg, home ovulation tests.  No positive pregnancy tests.  Explore adoption as a first option or as a secondary option after fertility treatments.

April-June, 2015: Focus on some personal issues, no birth control and no fertility treatments.  Remain on Metformin, prenatals.  No positive pregnancy tests.

July, 2015: Meet with Reproductive Endocrinologist.  Blood tests come back mostly normal but with one value slightly elevated for my age.  I don't remember which one right now, but the doctor noted that it might be indicative of diminishing egg reserve and that it's a good thing we've begun treatment now.  HSG is clear.  Husband's semen analysis isn't so great.  Concentration is 13 million/mL and 1% normal morphology.  Doctor suggests 1-3 cycles of IUI using Femara and trigger shot, then on to IVF.

August-November, 2015: Focus on some personal issues.  Explore adoption and IVF a little deeper.

December, 2015: First IUI cycle.  Husband's sperm numbers post-wash are not great.  Less than 3 million total motile sperm.  Doctor puts our chances of success through IUI at about 15%/month. Desperate Googling suggests this might be positive thinking. It's unclear to me how low these numbers are and whether or not a few more IUIs are worth the effort.

Today: I'm 3 days past IUI and I'm angry, I'm upset, I'm exhausted, and I'm so, so sad.  I'm scared to be pregnant, I'm scared to not be pregnant.  I want to do IVF and also I can't imagine going through IVF.  But I picked up some gummy prenatal vitamins yesterday, so that was fun I guess.

Thank you all for reading about my life over the past year and for the support I've gotten from this subreddit even as a lurker.  I guess today I'm finally upset enough to reach out.

<p>January-March, 2015: 3 cycles of unmonitored Femara 2.5 mg, home ovulation tests.  No positive pregnancy tests.  Explore adoption as a first option or as a secondary option after fertility treatments.</p>

<p>April-June, 2015: Focus on some personal issues, no birth control and no fertility treatments.  Remain on Metformin, prenatals.  No positive pregnancy tests.</p>

<p>July, 2015: Meet with Reproductive Endocrinologist.  Blood tests come back mostly normal but with one value slightly elevated for my age.  I don&#39;t remember which one right now, but the doctor noted that it might be indicative of diminishing egg reserve and that it&#39;s a good thing we&#39;ve begun treatment now.  HSG is clear.  Husband&#39;s semen analysis isn&#39;t so great.  Concentration is 13 million/mL and 1% normal morphology.  Doctor suggests 1-3 cycles of IUI using Femara and trigger shot, then on to IVF.</p>

<p>August-November, 2015: Focus on some personal issues.  Explore adoption and IVF a little deeper.</p>

<p>December, 2015: First IUI cycle.  Husband&#39;s sperm numbers post-wash are not great.  Less than 3 million total motile sperm.  Doctor puts our chances of success through IUI at about 15%/month. Desperate Googling suggests this might be positive thinking. It&#39;s unclear to me how low these numbers are and whether or not a few more IUIs are worth the effort.</p>

<p>Today: I&#39;m 3 days past IUI and I&#39;m angry, I&#39;m upset, I&#39;m exhausted, and I&#39;m so, so sad.  I&#39;m scared to be pregnant, I&#39;m scared to not be pregnant.  I want to do IVF and also I can&#39;t imagine going through IVF.  But I picked up some gummy prenatal vitamins yesterday, so that was fun I guess.</p>

<p>Thank you all for reading about my life over the past year and for the support I&#39;ve gotten from this subreddit even as a lurker.  I guess today I&#39;m finally upset enough to reach out.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Revised husband&#39;s post-wash value.</p>

It's *our holiday* Eventhough we've only  been married 3 years, we've already got so many traditions that we enjoy doing together this time of year. Last Christmas, we were only about 6 months trying for a baby, so we were disappointing just a little bit, but still happy about our prospects. But, this year has been the pitts, y'all. 

1. Hit 1 year of trying, got the work-up, everything is normal, nothing glaring, but low-ish AMH, referred to RE.

2. RE says we're unexplained. Recommends Clomid and sex, but watches a cyst on my ovary for 3 months before treatment. Finally, recommends a lap. 

3. Have the lap, remove the cyst, adhesions and endo. I had no idea I had endo. Didn't get a stage diagnosis though.

4. First post-lap cycle fails. RE reveals his true dick-ish-ness and I lose my shit at our last appointment. 

5. Christmas shopping for nieces and nephews. Enough said on that shit.

6. Overheard parents at Target talking about how excited they are for their kids' first Christmas. My face was like the water show at the Bellagio.

7. I thought creeping around the childfree sub would be a good idea. *WRONG!*

8. I'm taking my husband to Dallas for Christmas this year. We were gonna go last year, but he broke his foot. And to give him credit, even with a broken foot, we still had mad sex while I was ovulating. He'll be meeting my extended family and I just *know* the dreaded question will be asked at least 30,587 times. 

9. I can't believe my body sucks this much. I just can't believe we are here with a huge empty house and no kids of our own. No kids to buy gifts for.

10. Clomid sucks. I know so many of y'all are on IVF meds, and they're way worse, and I'm just so sorry for everyone here. This is just all so sad to me today. I want this year to be over. I want everything to be over. 

11. My in-laws are alcoholics and they always get drunk and ruin Christmas.

12. I asked my husband what he wanted for Christmas, he said he wanted to see me smile. 

13. I want a baby for Christmas. A baby for me, and a baby for you. 

14. During youth group yesterday, the youth pastor preached about how we're all made perfectly in the eyes of God and he loves us as we are. He wants us to love ourselves as we are. I most definitely do not love myself right now.

How are you guys handling/coping with Christmas? 

Oh, and a *SHOUT-OUT* (I just did that) to everyone who's finally got that special gift we're all waiting for!!!

154,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,

I'm 32 and my husband and I have been TTC for 3 years. We didn't have good insurance coverage until this year, so work up was started this summer. His SA was okay - not the greatest morphology but total count and motility are good. I did my HSG about 6 weeks ago and got the devastating news that my tubes are blocked, including a hydrosalpinx on one. (The other tube is also blocked at the distal end, but isn't dilated- the dye just stops, and won't flow out). 

I'm having laparoscopic surgery tomorrow afternoon so my GYN can take a look at everything, push dye again, and remove the hydrosalpinx. I am hopeful everything goes well!

My husband and I met with a RE a couple of weeks ago and are trying to mentally prepare for IVF. The RE absolutely wants the hydrosalpinx out, and actually has some hope that maybe the other tube just spasmed during the HSG. His opinion is that the fluid that drains from the hydrosalpinx is toxic and significantly impairs embryo implantation in the uterus - so if anything is getting through the other tube, it's not implanting because of the hydrosalpinx. I would love for the hydrosalpinx removal to be the solution, because IVF is so damn expensive and we have no infertility coverage, but I am trying to not get my hopes up.

If you're the praying type, or willing to send some positive vibes my way tomorrow afternoon, I would greatly appreciate it. I have never had any type of surgery before and am pretty nervous! 

If you've had this type of procedure before, how did your recovery go? My doc didn't give me much info about what to expect.

I went to Texas Fertility Center yesterday and met with a doctor who had success with my 50+ year old friend that got pregnant with twins. Needless to say, she comes highly recommended.

She sat down with me and got my background. I had all my previous bloodwork, past 12 months of cycles. She said she didn't even need to pull any blood since I gave her all that. Immediately, she said ""we need to fix your thyroid and get these TSH levels down."" I swear I almost started crying right there and we hadn't even gotten to the good stuff. I cannot believe how good it was to hear that.

Next she asked if I knew what all the bloodwork meant. I said, ""PCOS."" She said ""exactly."" Again, amazing thing to finally have a doctor say it rather than wax on about what it could or couldn't be. I asked her about my husband's SA numbers since his [morphology was really low](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3u8bjk/new_here_but_not_new_to_infertility/). She said she wasn't concerned about it yet since the other numbers were decent and didn't even think he should get off Prozac. She wants us to focus on getting my cycles on track first and then if we do another SA and it's not great, we'll get more aggressive (IUI, IVF, etc.)

We then did an ultrasound. I'm sure you guys all know how fun that is.

I asked if we should test for MTHFR before getting started with IVF and she responded that she won't test for it because there's not enough to evidence to support its existence and she doesn't think it's a worry for IVF.

I've got some autoimmune issues, and am spending all of my dollars for three rounds of IVF. There's no more money after that, so I want to be really proactive where possible.

I'm trying to find a delicate way to ask if this is her personal opinion or a clinic policy- I do really like her, other than this I'm super on board with her methodology.  Here are my questions:

-I know there are a few Ottawa (OFC) people here, who is your doc and has this come up for you?

I don't know why posting seems so hard- maybe because it makes this seem more real? Also, my apologies as this is way longer than I thought it would be.

Background:
-Went off hormonal bc in 2008. TTC for 6 months. Got stressed out and decided to NTNP and see what happened.

-Started having severe pain in 2011. Hadn't been to the gyn in years and was terrified to go because I was afraid something was terribly wrong.

-Husband finally convinced me to go in 2012 (I was having trouble even going to the bathroom at this point). Trans-vaginal ultrasound found 9cm endometrioma. Had 1st lap in July 2012 to remove endometrioma and was diagnosed with stage 4 endo.

-Was put on hormonal bc to tame the remaining endo until March 2013. Started NTNP again (kind of- I was temping so I knew when my fertile times were and we did not avoid)

-October 2013 pain was back and worse than before. Ultrasounds showed bilateral endometriomas. Started researching specialists for endo excision.

-March 2014 contacted 3 specialists and narrowed down my choice to a doctor in Maine. Scheduled 2nd lap for total excision of endo.

-July 2014 had total excision of endo removed from both ovaries, both pelvic sidewalls, both utero-sacral ligaments, bladder flap, and my rectum. I was like a new person- truly pain free for the first time since 2011.

-October 2014 exhaustion was back along with the familiar pain of endometriomas. Dr. ordered ultrasound which found 2 small 'endometriomas' on left ovary. He wasn't convinced and ordered follow up ultrasounds in December 2014 and March 2015. Also had me start pelvic floor pt. Started actively TTC.

-March 2015 ultrasound found multi-chambered endometriomas that had grown very quickly on left ovary. I had just started a new job and couldn't get leave for surgery yet so was put on Prozac to help with fatigue and anxiety.

-July 2015 flew to Maine for removal of left ovary and tube along with 2 very large multi-chambered endometriomas. No other endo was found during this lap so the excision worked (yay!)

-Now- still actively trying. Husband is finally coming to realize that the 'it will happen at the right time' may not be true naturally for us. We've decided if I don't get pregnant by February, then we will see the RE about our options. This is a huge step because he has never really wanted to go to the RE before.

Last week I received a letter from the hospital telling me that they are dealing with my referral and they provided some preliminary information about accessing the service through the NHS funding. 

I read that one of the requirement is for the female to have a BMI value no higher than 30. 
Well, I rushed online to the NHS website to check mine and I found out I am 32.5. 
Panic ensued. 

NO need to mention that I went on a diet straight away, as for my height I need to lose more or less 5-6 kg (doable if you are a strict dieter and with such an important target to motivate you). 

But now I am wondering if the NHS would really disqualify me if I don't reach the target weight in time (I don't have an appointment yet). How strict are these guidelines?  Do any of you had a first hand experience?

I suffer from a genetic myotony muscular disease so I cannot put myself through one of those fast weight loss programs that require a lot of physical activity. 

Also last yes I lost about the same amount of weight they ask me to lose now, but then I build up muscle (which made my phisiotherapist classify me back into normal muscular tone range on my legs - yay!) so now I am back in the overweight band.

Dr. M is an OBGYN with extensive fertility expertise- even had a clinic with Dr. J in the 80s. Dr. M is extremely through and wants to run basically every blood test again, he wants to look at my HSG results himself.  I got the world's longest and most through twat wanding- seriously, like 8 minutes- and they found cysts on my ovaries when no one else has ever looked that hard or found them.  He thinks I might have PCOS.  He kind of feels like the Dr. House of fertility.  The downside is that he doesn't only do fertility, and that gives me pause.  I scheduled a follow up appointment in a month after he looks at all of my test results.

Dr. J has the best IVF rates in the state and he has the arrogant attitude to go with that.  He rolls his eyes at all of the other doctor's diagnoses and believes I have endometriosis. Of all of the REs I have seen, he feels like the only one who is a step ahead of me.  He looked super throughly at my chart and truly grasped everything I had been through and most of his suggestions are things that I thought myself along the way (he thinks I was under medicated for the IVFs, that I triggered too early, etc.).  Although his confidence often drops into arrogance, his level of expertise and intimate understanding of fertility feels extremely high.  I scheduled a lap with him in February.  

My initial thought was to cancel my follow up with Dr. M and not do the tests he ordered.  But yesterday I thought... why not both?  Why not do the tests Dr. M ordered and have the follow up and then go from there?  I realize that means I am working with two doctors at once for a month but I have nothing to do for Dr. J in that month.  I like all of the tests Dr. M want to run and I like how anal he is.  He's also the leading OBGYN surgeon in the state, so having him look at my HSG sounds awesome- just in case!  Being unexplained is driving me batty and Dr. M is the one who really wants to figure it out- the other doctors are more focused on getting me pregnant.  Obviously, pregnancy is the end goal but it'd be nice to know if the treatment I am doing can even work.

First, I'm still getting used to these ultrasounds while bleeding. This was my 2nd. I took off my pants, pulled out my tampon and hopped on the table. Then, I immediately felt a flow that went down between my legs and start soaking the little puppy-pad thing they put down. Then the Dr comes in, and I'm like, ugh, it's bad down there. He doesn't say anything. Doesn't look up from his notepad.

He asks what we're going to want to do this cycle. We said IUI. Now, lets back track a bit. After my lap in Oct, he wanted us to try natural with no meds for 3 months. Then, at the second follow-up he says, I think we should add Clomid. We're still on the first cycle. I said okay. Then, on the CD12 he starts talking about when the IUI will be, trigger, etc. Then my husband said what? I thought you wanted us to do the natural? Then the Dr says, well you can, but you only have about a 6-10% chance. Why didn't he say that to begin with?! We decided not to do the IUI that cycle. But our natural attempt, even with the Clomid and three follicles, was a bust. 

Back to yesterday, we say IUI. Y'all, this is a big step for me. I felt like I was really taking a big step and putting on my big girl pants and all of that. Reminding myself what I was told in ifbabies, they all come out the same. Then he says, you guys need to start thinking about IVF. With endo/unexplained, this is really what you should be doing. Then we can look at the embryos.

I died y'all. I went into full-on heave cries. Like cries I had only had when my brother died. I feel like the Dr is not even trying! Shouldn't we do more tests first? We're barely starting our second post-lap cycle. I just feel like he wants us out of his hair. Every time we see him it's something more and more extreme. I just don't see how he can know IVF is the only way yet. My husband has really good swimmers, I ovulate and respond well to Clomid, uterus looks good, tubes are clear, endo/endometrioma is gone, how can IVF be his logical conclusion at this point?! I felt suckerpunched. 

Also, the room was tiny and he had two med students with him. It was a sardine can, and everyone saw my bloody bits. I was so embarrassed. I know it's the way it is, but geeze. 

I cried all night, then when I finally fell asleep I dreamed I found a bunch of dead animals/pets in my moms house. :(

Is all of this normal? If you're case is similar, when did you RE suggest IVF? Am I being difficult/overly emotional? Tell me like it is, please.

And for me, knowledge is power, so perhaps going in knowing step by step what will happen will calm any jitters about the procedure. 

1-1.5 hours before the procedure, I took 660 mg Aleve and 1 mg Xanax (I get claustrophobic in those small dark rooms...I'm weird). 

They called me back and let my husband come with me. I stopped in a room and changed into a gown. Then they took me into the x ray room. I lay on a table with a pillow (quite comfortable all things considered) underneath the X-ray machine. My husband was allowed in the room and given an apron for the radiation. 

The nurse asked for the date of my last menstrual period to confirm I have no chance of being pregnant. Then the doctor came in. He pulled me down closer to his end of the table. He was very helpful and explained every step of the process. 

First, he inserted the speculum. Then he swabbed some antiseptic on my cervix. Then he applied a local anesthetic to the cervix. I felt a mild pinch for a few seconds but that was it. Then he inserted the catheter (no pain thanks to the local anesthetic) and injected the dye. 

I did feel some pressure when the dye was inserted. It wasn't painful, per se, just an odd feeling. A little like menstrual cramps but not exactly. The pressure and discomfort lasted a minute, tops. 

And then he removed the catheter and speculum and that was that. The whole thing took less than 5 minutes. They asked me to remain lying down for a couple of minutes. 

The doctor showed me my results on the x-ray screen. My tubes were open. My left Fallopian tube and ovary are way up high in my abdomen (?!) and I may have a tiny polyp in my uterus, but he didn't seem concerned by it. 

Then he left and the x-ray tech asked me to sit up slowly to make sure I wasn't light headed. I felt fine. Got dressed and noticed I was spotting bright red blood, which they told me was expected. 

And that was it. They said they'd send the x rays to our RE and sent us on our way. Last step is for the husband to get a SA done (Friday) and our follow up appointment with the RE is Monday when we'll find out what the plan is. I'm tentatively diagnosed with PCOS. 

Anyway...that was my HSG experience, start to finish. I had some very mild cramping in the car on the way back to work but it's gone now. 

I hope this helps anyone who isn't sure what to expect. Knowing what will happen always eases my anxiety about these things. If you have any more questions, feel free to PM me and I'll do my best to help. Good luck my lovelies. You are all such brave, amazing, strong women.

My questions are - 1) Has anyone done payment plans before? Are hospitals generally game to make this work and not harass me at every step? 2) What can I expect for terms? 3) Do I negotiate this ahead of time? or is this something where I get my bills and then surprise them with it?

We&#39;ve got $2000 in our HSA and a decent amount in savings, but I&#39;m not about to wipe us out over this. </p>

<p>My thinking is that I&#39;d pay $1500 out of the HSA and figure out a payment plan with the hospital for the remaining $4000. </p>

<p>My questions are - 1) Has anyone done payment plans before? Are hospitals generally game to make this work and not harass me at every step? 2) What can I expect for terms? 3) Do I negotiate this ahead of time? or is this something where I get my bills and then surprise them with it? Feels like a bad faith gesture to surprise them, but I work in banking, I know some people play that way. </p>

<p>Would love input on this. </p>

From what I've read ovulating on femera can happen anywhere from cd11-16. Since today is cd9 and it's still light enough that I've used a light day tampon...is that enough time for my uterus between now and ovulation or is this cycle basically a write off?

Some background: Husband (36) and I (28) have been trying for 7 ish years with no pregnancies. Went straight to IVF four years ago because we had insurance that covered 80% of it and we were about to lose it. Failed cycle with poor embryo quality. Took a 3 year break. I have PCOS and endo. Husband had testicular cancer six years ago but his SA's have always been good. RE doesn't know why we can't get pregnant though his guess is that my PCOS could be contributing to poor egg quality, husband's sperm could have fragmented DNA, or some other random thing we haven't figured out yet. 

As of now, we're scheduled for an IUI this upcoming cycle and we decided to try 2-3 IUIs since we skipped that step and they're much cheaper than IVF. However, my RE called today and said I qualify for their shared risk program but if my first cycle results in poor egg quality, we'll be disqualified and receive our money back. On one hand, we said we'd stop at IVF because we don't have the money upfront and are terrified at taking out a loan and then having to make large payments if we do get pregnant. On the other, if my egg quality is poor again, we can have peace and closure on this journey. 

My two biggest fears are 1) not doing enough to have a child and wondering what if and 2) being so far in debt that I can't breathe or live an awesome child free life that compensates for my lack of progeny. 

I know my husband and I need to make this decision but I'd appreciate any thoughts that could give me perspective.

Husband had testicular cancer six years ago but his SA&#39;s have always been good. RE doesn&#39;t know why we can&#39;t get pregnant though his guess is that my PCOS could be contributing to poor egg quality, husband&#39;s sperm could have fragmented DNA, or some other random thing we haven&#39;t figured out yet. </p>

<p>As of now, we&#39;re scheduled for an IUI this upcoming cycle and we decided to try 2-3 IUIs since we skipped that step and they&#39;re much cheaper than IVF. However, my RE called today and said I qualify for their shared risk program but if my first cycle results in poor egg quality, we&#39;ll be disqualified and receive our money back. On one hand, we said we&#39;d stop at IVF because we don&#39;t have the money upfront and are terrified at taking out a loan and then having to make large payments if we do get pregnant. On the other, if my egg quality is poor again, we can have peace and closure on this journey. </p>

<p>My two biggest fears are 1) not doing enough to have a child and wondering what if and 2) being so far in debt that I can&#39;t breathe or live an awesome child free life that compensates for my lack of progeny. </p>

<p>I know my husband and I need to make this decision but I&#39;d appreciate any thoughts that could give me perspective. </p>

<p>Tl;dr IVF is pricey and I don&#39;t know if I want the debt </p>

/u/kwazykupcakes2: Another SA next week. My husband had been pretty shity about taking his pills so I'm not optimistic. I guess after that we have to have a serious conversation about IVF and how we are going to pay for it.

/u/Alces_alces_: Mr Alces has varicocele surgery December 2, then six weeks of waiting before we determine next steps.

/u/lottiela: I get my schedule December 7th for my early January cycle. I am SO FREAKING READY TO GET STARTED..

/u/closedblueyes: First RE appointment has been moved to this Friday! Really looking forward to getting new info and a more aggressive plan.

/u/Puppiesandcupcakes: Got the go ahead over Thanksgiving that my parents will be able to help finance our IVF. SUCH a relief and literally so thankful. We have it scheduled for June because then my school will be out for the summer. Till then, trying naturally but not putting any stress on it.

/u/amelioratia: Waiting on endometrial biopsy; FET estimated in Feb. 2016

/u/bicycling_elephant: My husband has the BRCA1 mutation, so we're going to try IVF with embryo screening (I think that's called PGD?). We just had our first appointment last month, and this month I have a bunch of diagnostic tests. I've got a hysterocopy scheduled for the 15th, which I'm a little nervous about. At the end of the month, we have an appointment with our main doctor about all of the results.

/u/PhillyGrrl: I'm waiting for my new insurance to kick in in January, when I'll be starting IVF#2.

/u/whatsanity: Taking December off as I don't have time to get down to vancouver for the sperm a few days before I move down there.

/u/mrswaka: We're giving up on trying until I'm done with school. With 20 cycles, one laparoscopy, and one medicated cycle under my belt, I'm exhausted, but confident that we could move straight into IUIs in August 2017. For now, we're NTNP. 

/u/medtech07: Waiting for period. Natural FET cycle starts this month with transfer being the first week of January.

/u/Passiflora15: Had laparoscopic surgery 12/07 with intention to remove hydrosalpinx. When Gyn got in there, everything in pelvis and abdomen is covered in adhesions - hydrosalpinx not able to be removed. (But, other tube is miraculously open, despite being covered in adhesions.)

<p><a href=""/u/Shiny-Grenade"">/u/Shiny-Grenade</a>: Seeing the doc on Dec 11, more info to follow on a FET</p>

<p><a href=""/u/kwazykupcakes2"">/u/kwazykupcakes2</a>: Another SA next week. My husband had been pretty shity about taking his pills so I&#39;m not optimistic. I guess after that we have to have a serious conversation about IVF and how we are going to pay for it.</p>

<p><a href=""/u/Alces_alces_"">/u/Alces_alces_</a>: Mr Alces has varicocele surgery December 2, then six weeks of waiting before we determine next steps.</p>

<p><a href=""/u/lottiela"">/u/lottiela</a>: I get my schedule December 7th for my early January cycle. I am SO FREAKING READY TO GET STARTED..</p>

<p><a href=""/u/closedblueyes"">/u/closedblueyes</a>: First RE appointment has been moved to this Friday! Really looking forward to getting new info and a more aggressive plan.</p>

<p><a href=""/u/Puppiesandcupcakes"">/u/Puppiesandcupcakes</a>: Got the go ahead over Thanksgiving that my parents will be able to help finance our IVF. SUCH a relief and literally so thankful. We have it scheduled for June because then my school will be out for the summer. Till then, trying naturally but not putting any stress on it.</p>

<p><a href=""/u/amelioratia"">/u/amelioratia</a>: Waiting on endometrial biopsy; FET estimated in Feb. 2016</p>

<p><a href=""/u/bicycling_elephant"">/u/bicycling_elephant</a>: My husband has the BRCA1 mutation, so we&#39;re going to try IVF with embryo screening (I think that&#39;s called PGD?). We just had our first appointment last month, and this month I have a bunch of diagnostic tests. I&#39;ve got a hysterocopy scheduled for the 15th, which I&#39;m a little nervous about. At the end of the month, we have an appointment with our main doctor about all of the results.</p>

<p><a href=""/u/PhillyGrrl"">/u/PhillyGrrl</a>: I&#39;m waiting for my new insurance to kick in in January, when I&#39;ll be starting IVF#2.</p>

<p><a href=""/u/whatsanity"">/u/whatsanity</a>: Taking December off as I don&#39;t have time to get down to vancouver for the sperm a few days before I move down there.</p>

<p><a href=""/u/mrswaka"">/u/mrswaka</a>: We&#39;re giving up on trying until I&#39;m done with school. With 20 cycles, one laparoscopy, and one medicated cycle under my belt, I&#39;m exhausted, but confident that we could move straight into IUIs in August 2017. For now, we&#39;re NTNP. </p>

<p><a href=""/u/medtech07"">/u/medtech07</a>: Waiting for period. Natural FET cycle starts this month with transfer being the first week of January.</p>

<p><a href=""/u/Passiflora15"">/u/Passiflora15</a>: Had laparoscopic surgery 12/07 with intention to remove hydrosalpinx. When Gyn got in there, everything in pelvis and abdomen is covered in adhesions - hydrosalpinx not able to be removed. (But, other tube is miraculously open, despite being covered in adhesions.) Have post op appointment 12/21, hopefully Gyn will have new plan. She is supposed to find a more specialized surgeon for adhesiolysis and to remove the hydrosalpinx. Meet back with RE end of Dec.</p>

I had my visit today, and it went well. I got TONS of info, and we have a new plan to move forward. He took a bunch of blood, did an ultrasound (7 cysts per ovary!), and took my history, etc. He's switching me to Chlomid, doing a mid-cycle ultrasound, then once we decide if we want to do an IUI (which he thinks is our next step), then we'll see about trigger shots, etc... he gave me lots of written info, and the clinic was upfront about pricing (IUI is way more affordable than I thought it would be!). I'm glad I went! 

So, now, we just need to figure out how fast to proceed. I'm thinking because hubby is a professor and has an insanely busy schedule we might not be able to do an IUI until summer, but it'll be nice to get a few more answers in the meantime.

My doctor prescribed me 100MG Progesterone daily from ovulation to CD1 and sent me on my way. I didn't know at the time to even ask how to take them and he didn't offer. After my first LP on progesterone was still only 9 days, he told me that he couldn't prescribe any other dosage and I'll have to see an RE for further help, but to keep taking the progesterone until then. I think he'll be great once I actually get pregnant, but I feel like he's way out of his depth with TTC.

I'll be visiting an RE in January, but I have some questions in the mean time and I'm hoping I can draw on your experience.

I just found out this month that I can take the same pills vaginally instead of just orally. I've been doing so hoping it'll have a real effect on my LP, but I don't know what to make of my experiences this past week. 

While taking it orally for two months, I had painfully sore boobs after 3-4 days that lasted until the day before my period started. I saw a fair amount of swelling in my feet, and to a much lesser extent my hands. I had mild nausea 4-5 days in.

Now with taking it vaginally, I'm not experiences any of that. My feet have swollen slightly one day but that might've been from a change of diet for Thanksgiving day. My boobs were pretty sore the day after I ovulated, before I even took the first pill, but that faded after about 4 days. There's been no nausea.

Is it normal for side effects to change so drastically with taking it vaginally instead of orally? I almost feel like I'm not actually getting the progesterone in my system. Is vaginal preferred to oral?

My doctor prescribed me 100MG Progesterone daily from ovulation to CD1 and sent me on my way. I didn&#39;t know at the time to even ask how to take them and he didn&#39;t offer. After my first LP on progesterone was still only 9 days, he told me that he couldn&#39;t prescribe any other dosage and I&#39;ll have to see an RE for further help, but to keep taking the progesterone until then. I think he&#39;ll be great once I actually get pregnant, but I feel like he&#39;s way out of his depth with TTC.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be visiting an RE in January, but I have some questions in the mean time and I&#39;m hoping I can draw on your experience.</p>

<p>I just found out this month that I can take the same pills vaginally instead of just orally. I&#39;ve been doing so hoping it&#39;ll have a real effect on my LP, but I don&#39;t know what to make of my experiences this past week. </p>

<p>While taking it orally for two months, I had painfully sore boobs after 3-4 days that lasted until the day before my period started. I saw a fair amount of swelling in my feet, and to a much lesser extent my hands. I had mild nausea 4-5 days in.</p>

<p>Now with taking it vaginally, I&#39;m not experiences any of that. My feet have swollen slightly one day but that might&#39;ve been from a change of diet for Thanksgiving day. My boobs were pretty sore the day after I ovulated, before I even took the first pill, but that faded after about 4 days. There&#39;s been no nausea.</p>

<p>Is it normal for side effects to change so drastically with taking it vaginally instead of orally? I almost feel like I&#39;m not actually getting the progesterone in my system. Is vaginal preferred to oral?</p>

Guys, I'm way to early in this thing to feel this way, right? My RE told me my prognosis was great (although I sort of felt like she was blowing smoke), so what gives? Why am I not excited anymore? Why do I already feel so burnt out? I have my prescriptions waiting for me and I'm half tempted to just not pick them up. It's like the whole idea of this has just soured in my head.
