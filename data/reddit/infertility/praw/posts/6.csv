10,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"A couple of weeks ago there was a thread devoted to the question of how many IVF cycles you were willing to try. I found the discussion fascinating, mainly because everyone’s answer was so different. If there is one thing I’ve learned on this sub, it is that everyone comes at this from a different place. And if there’s one thing I have learned over the last six years of trying to conceive, and in the last three years of IF treatment, it's that after a certain period of time, you land in a different place than where you started—often in a place that is much different than you had originally imagined. There’s something else I have learned, largely through radically honest conversations with my beloved partner: how to reach way down inside yourself to identify how you’re really feeling.

At some point in this last FET cycle, I started giving up hope. I didn’t feel excitement like I did with the last two transfers. I didn’t daydream about what I would name the kid. I didn’t put the picture of the embryos up on the fridge. The pictures stayed in my colored clinic folder with the description of my protocol, price list, and injection instructions. This transfer felt like a medical procedure, nothing more, nothing less. Don’t get me wrong -- I am disappointed and angry that this transfer didn’t work. I ugly cried a few times. But I’m not surprised. I have no idea what’s wrong with me, or what is potentially wrong with the embryos. Clearly implantation is not an issue. I just can’t get anything to stick in there.

At my last appointment with my RE before the transfer, I told her that we wouldn’t do another fresh IVF cycle if the next three transfers failed. She seemed surprised, but was supportive as always. My plan, if this transfer didn’t take, was to move immediately to the last remaining embryo on the next cycle. I wanted to be done with this by the fall. I wanted an answer to the question of whether or not we would have children. I wanted – more than anything else – to be out of limbo. But this week as I realized that this transfer—two embryos, our very best chance—likely didn’t work, there was a phrase that kept running through my brain: *I am done.*

We often speak on this sub as though there’s only one way out of here. We welcome newcomers and hope they don’t have to stay long. When we say that we “graduate,” we mean that we graduate to a baby. But that’s not the only way out of here. I recognize that leaving infertilityland without a baby is everyone’s worst fear. I recognize that I am my own worst fear from a few years ago. I couldn’t imagine life without children, but more to the point, I couldn't imagine going through all of this hell (not to mention spending nearly 40K) for nothing. But in the years since then, I’ve often sat with that fear and really mucked around with what it meant. What am I so afraid of? What am I missing?

What I realized this week was that what I’m missing is my life. I used to think that I couldn’t imagine a life without children. But I am already living a life without children. And it's a great life. I have a lot in my life that means a lot to me. My husband. My family. My career. My writing. My friends. Making things. In the last three years, I’ve had to give up a lot for infertility. I turned down a big deal residential fellowship this past fall because of PIO shots. I published a book—a lifelong dream of mine—but didn’t feel the joy of it, because it was released five days after I miscarried. I’ve canceled more trips and social engagements for “medical reasons” than I can count. I’ve put my life on hold as the “what if we have children” plan oscillates with the “what if we don’t have children” plan. I realized yesterday that this is what *I am done* means. I am done thinking “when/if we have children.” I have no doubt that I’ll do that last transfer. I can’t imagine not doing it. But to be honest, I really don’t think it will work. It is more likely than not that I will never have children. 

Giving up hope is often synonymous with despair. But that’s only if you’re only focused on one thing. Giving up hope on one thing can also lead you to a different thing. To many different things.

And, of course, giving up is – particularly in American culture – thought of as the worst possible thing you can do. Only losers give up, we are told. Only people who don’t really want it give up. Only weak people give up. But that is so totally, completely, one hundred percent false. It’s strong to do what is best for you, even if that thing is to move on to something else.

I need to take a break. From infertilityland, from limbo, and thus from this beautiful, supportive community. I need to start living the life I have, which is, I’m fairly certain, the life I’ll continue to have. It's my birthday on Wednesday, and I'm going to start something new. When I’m finally ready for that last transfer, I’ll probably pop back in here to get some of the support that has meant so incredibly much to me over the past year. But I hope that I don’t see you. I hope you’re all gone and comfortably in places that give you peace -- wherever those places may be.

As a final note (on an already really long note!), if there are other folks who find themselves where I am now, I've been finding a lot of comfort in this book *The Next Happy*, by Tracey Cleantis. She’s One Of Us. Oh, and, if you’re feeling the same kind of exasperation with treatment as I am, even if you’re not in the same place I am, I can’t recommend this blog post enough: http://bit.ly/1SyoCv0 I just about died laughing.

I’ve put my life on hold as the “what if we have children” plan oscillates with the “what if we don’t have children” plan. I realized yesterday that this is what <em>I am done</em> means. I am done thinking “when/if we have children.” I have no doubt that I’ll do that last transfer. I can’t imagine not doing it. But to be honest, I really don’t think it will work. It is more likely than not that I will never have children. </p>

<p>Giving up hope is often synonymous with despair. But that’s only if you’re only focused on one thing. Giving up hope on one thing can also lead you to a different thing. To many different things.</p>

<p>And, of course, giving up is – particularly in American culture – thought of as the worst possible thing you can do. Only losers give up, we are told. Only people who don’t really want it give up. Only weak people give up. But that is so totally, completely, one hundred percent false. It’s strong to do what is best for you, even if that thing is to move on to something else.</p>

<p>I need to take a break. From infertilityland, from limbo, and thus from this beautiful, supportive community. I need to start living the life I have, which is, I’m fairly certain, the life I’ll continue to have. It&#39;s my birthday on Wednesday, and I&#39;m going to start something new. When I’m finally ready for that last transfer, I’ll probably pop back in here to get some of the support that has meant so incredibly much to me over the past year. But I hope that I don’t see you. I hope you’re all gone and comfortably in places that give you peace -- wherever those places may be.</p>

<p>As a final note (on an already really long note!), if there are other folks who find themselves where I am now, I&#39;ve been finding a lot of comfort in this book <em>The Next Happy</em>, by Tracey Cleantis. She’s One Of Us. Oh, and, if you’re feeling the same kind of exasperation with treatment as I am, even if you’re not in the same place I am, I can’t recommend this blog post enough: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1SyoCv0"">http://bit.ly/1SyoCv0</a> I just about died laughing.</p>

<p>Much love, dear ones.</p>

<p>Edit to add: Thank you so much for you kind words, everyone. xo. </p>

18,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So yesterday I was working, and at the very last minute a client walks in (actually a coworkers wife, who gets a hefty discount mind you) and asks for an express facial 30 minutes before we close... Boss wouldn't let me say no, and even with a discount I still need the money.

So I take her up. I ask her about her skin and she starts telling me about how she gets break outs during her ""menstrual cycle"". I  say it like this because she never once said ""period"". Even when I said the word, she refused to use it. 

We started talking about birth control and how when I came off of it I had acne again. She mentioned her daughter having irregular menstrual cycles and talked about this root that she wanted to give to her to try for her ""unhappy endocrine system"".

I mentioned that I have PCOS, endometriosis, have had laps, blahblahblah. I also mentioned that I've noticed a lot more infertility related problems in women compared to when I was younger (or maybe I'm crazy). 

Wanna know what she said?! She goes, ""Well, caffeine causes infertility, you know. Also, women begged and begged for equal rights to go to college and become business women and then it's too late for them. Women are getting careers and becoming too old to have children of their own, and they're only hurting themselves by drinking caffeine during their prime reproductive years"". 

I said that I'm the only woman in my circle of friends who doesn't have a child, and out of everyone I went to highschool with who doesn't as well. I went to college. I have a career, and I drink coffee daily. So it's my fault that I'm infertile.

She asked how old I am, and I told her. She said, ""Oh, well you're still young. You have a few more years"". What?! Stop. 

So in the end, I smiled and took her downstairs and threw her back to her husband (my coworker). Just wanted to share my frustration. 

edit: adding more to the story. She also then proceeded to tell me that if I can't have kids in the next few years I should adopt one from a young teenager in exchange for her to go to college to be smarter.

Boss wouldn&#39;t let me say no, and even with a discount I still need the money.</p>

<p>So I take her up. I ask her about her skin and she starts telling me about how she gets break outs during her &quot;menstrual cycle&quot;. I  say it like this because she never once said &quot;period&quot;. Even when I said the word, she refused to use it. </p>

<p>We started talking about birth control and how when I came off of it I had acne again. She mentioned her daughter having irregular menstrual cycles and talked about this root that she wanted to give to her to try for her &quot;unhappy endocrine system&quot;.</p>

<p>I mentioned that I have PCOS, endometriosis, have had laps, blahblahblah. I also mentioned that I&#39;ve noticed a lot more infertility related problems in women compared to when I was younger (or maybe I&#39;m crazy). </p>

<p>Wanna know what she said?! She goes, &quot;Well, caffeine causes infertility, you know. Also, women begged and begged for equal rights to go to college and become business women and then it&#39;s too late for them. Women are getting careers and becoming too old to have children of their own, and they&#39;re only hurting themselves by drinking caffeine during their prime reproductive years&quot;. </p>

<p>I said that I&#39;m the only woman in my circle of friends who doesn&#39;t have a child, and out of everyone I went to highschool with who doesn&#39;t as well. I went to college. I have a career, and I drink coffee daily. So it&#39;s my fault that I&#39;m infertile.</p>

<p>She asked how old I am, and I told her. She said, &quot;Oh, well you&#39;re still young. You have a few more years&quot;. What?! Stop. </p>

<p>So in the end, I smiled and took her downstairs and threw her back to her husband (my coworker). Just wanted to share my frustration. </p>

<p>edit: adding more to the story. She also then proceeded to tell me that if I can&#39;t have kids in the next few years I should adopt one from a young teenager in exchange for her to go to college to be smarter. She said smart women can&#39;t have children, and then can adopt them from young women and send them to college. She has two kids. A 16 year old girl (this lady is like 35) and a boy.

30,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So, I got a re-consult after testing with my RE. She said pretty much what I thought she would. That we should do IUI.

All of our testing came back positive. My husbands SA even improved from last time he took it, so they aren't blaming MFI like I thought the issue might be. So they're saying its unexplained aka they don't know what's wrong, but something's wrong.

So what's kind of bothering me is that I had my progesterone tested awhile back with a regular doctor and it came back low. So when I went to the RE in April, I told them that right away. When my other testing was coming back good, I said, what about progesterone? I had to ask multiple times. The RE asked for my old results, then said it was good enough.  I told them I ovulated and didn't want to lose a cycle.  Then I had to ask if I could get on supplements since it was low, and they ignored me awhile before saying they didnt think I needed it at this time, but we could discuss at the reconsult. Then when I went in today and she recommended IUI, I again had to bring up the progesterone, which they decided to retest today (even though I asked if I could do it last cycle and they said I didnt need to) & she finally said, if it's low, they can get me on something and I can try just that for a few months if that's what I want to do (said with a weird fake smile, but maybe I'm being paranoid). My husband thinks its because the they just want money, so they want to go for the most expensive procedures, but idk. I'd like to think they wouldnt be that shady? Has anyone experienced anything like that? I thought testing and treating that would be a first step, but they never asked to test it, I really had to push for it.

Anyway, IUI.. Our insurance covers 9 cycles of it I believe.. which are only supposed to cost me $50 for a copay, more if a surgery is involved, which I'm kind of confused about. But we have no IVF coverage. So as much as I am thinking maybe progesterone is my issue, IUI being that affordable, doesn't hurt to try, does it?

She said pretty much what I thought she would. That we should do IUI.</p>

<p>All of our testing came back positive. My husbands SA even improved from last time he took it, so they aren&#39;t blaming MFI like I thought the issue might be. So they&#39;re saying its unexplained aka they don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, but something&#39;s wrong.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s kind of bothering me is that I had my progesterone tested awhile back with a regular doctor and it came back low. So when I went to the RE in April, I told them that right away. When my other testing was coming back good, I said, what about progesterone? I had to ask multiple times. The RE asked for my old results, then said it was good enough.  I told them I ovulated and didn&#39;t want to lose a cycle.  Then I had to ask if I could get on supplements since it was low, and they ignored me awhile before saying they didnt think I needed it at this time, but we could discuss at the reconsult. Then when I went in today and she recommended IUI, I again had to bring up the progesterone, which they decided to retest today (even though I asked if I could do it last cycle and they said I didnt need to) &amp; she finally said, if it&#39;s low, they can get me on something and I can try just that for a few months if that&#39;s what I want to do (said with a weird fake smile, but maybe I&#39;m being paranoid). My husband thinks its because the they just want money, so they want to go for the most expensive procedures, but idk. I&#39;d like to think they wouldnt be that shady? Has anyone experienced anything like that? I thought testing and treating that would be a first step, but they never asked to test it, I really had to push for it.</p>

<p>Anyway, IUI.. Our insurance covers 9 cycles of it I believe.. which are only supposed to cost me $50 for a copay, more if a surgery is involved, which I&#39;m kind of confused about. But we have no IVF coverage. So as much as I am thinking maybe progesterone is my issue, IUI being that affordable, doesn&#39;t hurt to try, does it?  They said clomid for 5 days and monitoring and possibly back to back insemination for each cycle. I haven&#39;t read much about anyone&#39;s experience with IUI yet since we were just told we should try it.</p>

<p>So is my clinic money hungry?.. is it normal not to test for progesterone right away? Should I just try the IUI since my insurance covers it? We pay out of pocket, a lot, so honestly I&#39;d like to make it worth it.</p>

75,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"(Questions start in 3rd paragraph)

 First, let me say thanks for all the responses about my first cycle with femara!  It's been really helpful.  And while I would love to take your advice on getting an RE, that's not plausible.  I live in a rural community and it's not really even plausible for me to get another OBGYN, at least not without a huge wait for every appointment.  If I was willing to drive two hours each way I still couldn't afford to as my insurance doesn't cover fertility to begin with.  I also simplified what's been going on with my doc too keep the post short before.  And while it is true that she told me  that monitoring wasn't necessary, I think she did so as an effort to save me money.  

That being said, my OBGYN is basically willing to do whatever I want when it comes to my fertility treatment.  When I asked about monitoring my follicles, she told me she didn't think it was necessary, but that she would schedule it if I wanted to.  What it boils down to is I guess I need to get an online degree in fertility so I can direct my own care.  =-)  

Now on to the questions.  I have been prescribed the injectable form of progesterone.  I had zero monitoring of my follicles while on femara this month and only a faintly darker than normal positive opk.  This means there isn't a huge likelihood of my being pregnant, but there is a chance.  I was instructed to give myself the shot (I have training in giving IM shots and requested this form rather than ten days of pills) on day 21 of my cycle if no positive opk.  Is it safe for me to take the 4 ml of progesterone that early if there's the slightest chance I may be pregnant?

How frequently should my femara dosage be upped and what is the high end of the dosages?  What days should I be getting an ultrasound?  How long should I try femara before giving up and trying something else?

I have tried metformin to help with my cycles with no benefit.  I have gotten my HSG and have a ""beautiful uterus and tubes"".   Right now I'm on femara for ovulation and progesterone to start my cycles.  I will go six months or more without a period otherwise.  I also take myo-inositol because of the studies I've read that say how it improves ovulation.  I have been diagnosed with PCOS verified with ultrasound and I have an exophytic (on the outside of my uterus, not inside) fibroid that is large enough to be mistaken for an ovary.

<p>First, let me say thanks for all the responses about my first cycle with femara!  It&#39;s been really helpful.  And while I would love to take your advice on getting an RE, that&#39;s not plausible.  I live in a rural community and it&#39;s not really even plausible for me to get another OBGYN, at least not without a huge wait for every appointment.  If I was willing to drive two hours each way I still couldn&#39;t afford to as my insurance doesn&#39;t cover fertility to begin with.  I also simplified what&#39;s been going on with my doc too keep the post short before.  And while it is true that she told me  that monitoring wasn&#39;t necessary, I think she did so as an effort to save me money.  </p>

<p>That being said, my OBGYN is basically willing to do whatever I want when it comes to my fertility treatment.  When I asked about monitoring my follicles, she told me she didn&#39;t think it was necessary, but that she would schedule it if I wanted to.  What it boils down to is I guess I need to get an online degree in fertility so I can direct my own care.  =-)  </p>

<p>Now on to the questions.  I have been prescribed the injectable form of progesterone.  I had zero monitoring of my follicles while on femara this month and only a faintly darker than normal positive opk.  This means there isn&#39;t a huge likelihood of my being pregnant, but there is a chance.  I was instructed to give myself the shot (I have training in giving IM shots and requested this form rather than ten days of pills) on day 21 of my cycle if no positive opk.  Is it safe for me to take the 4 ml of progesterone that early if there&#39;s the slightest chance I may be pregnant?</p>

<p>How frequently should my femara dosage be upped and what is the high end of the dosages?  What days should I be getting an ultrasound?  How long should I try femara before giving up and trying something else?</p>

<p>I have tried metformin to help with my cycles with no benefit.  I have gotten my HSG and have a &quot;beautiful uterus and tubes&quot;.   Right now I&#39;m on femara for ovulation and progesterone to start my cycles.  I will go six months or more without a period otherwise.  I also take myo-inositol because of the studies I&#39;ve read that say how it improves ovulation.  I have been diagnosed with PCOS verified with ultrasound and I have an exophytic (on the outside of my uterus, not inside) fibroid that is large enough to be mistaken for an ovary.  I have read that fibroids have been linked to infertility, but nothing concrete has been proven.  Am I not doing something I should?  What is the next step if what I am doing doesn&#39;t work?</p>

<p>If you read all of that and answered, you rock and thanks!  If not, well, you&#39;re not reading this, but I understand anyways.  =-D</p>

I mentioned a while back that I just got a negative beta back. It was the third (and final) PGS tested embryo I have transferred. Two resulted in negative betas, one in a miscarriage at 6 week. 

As always, my doctor expressed surprise it didn't work. I did have fluid in or near my fallopian tube this past cycle, so he wants me to get further testing to see if it's hydrosalpinx. He doesn't think it's a magic bullet solution, as the fluid wasn't there in previous cycle, but he did suggest if it is a hyrdrosalpinx, fluid could be draining into the uterus  and making the uterus inhospitable (or as they say on Grey's Anatomy, hostile).

I told him I was reluctant to try IVF again without any new information or plan. He referred me to a colleague who specializes in recurrent miscarriage and recurrent implantation failure. I was able to get an appointment……IN NOVEMBER. 

Gah. How is it possible that after two and a half years, I'm back at the figuring out what is wrong stage?

Thanks for letting me vent/update. Also, wasn't there an episode of Sex in the City where Samantha gets herself into an oncologist that has a long wait list? I should probably rewatch it for tips.

127,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I haven't introduced myself in my own thread, so this will double as that. 

Today we had our debrief of our first IVF. As chance would have it we spoke with the fellow first, who we haven't seen for a consult since our initial meet and greet. I have a weird rapport with him and I'm constantly trying to be funny (I guess because he's so young and approachable).

I finally tried the strategy of saying ""Instead of me asking you about all these things as I understand them, please give me your sales pitch."" ""I'm not really selling anything."" ""The bills suggest otherwise.""

He asked me to remind him how long we'd been trying. That's the weird part - it's been 3.5 years but we've only managed three interventions in the 2.5 years since we sought help. Our only diagnosis is MFI. We did two IUIs at our first clinic, moved, had a natural chemical pregnancy which preempted our IVF at our second clinic, moved (second time in 8 months), and have only finished testing + IVF + FETs at this clinic in the 12 months since we settled. So we really haven't tried much. 

Completely without hearing from me, he suggested we not dive right back into another IVF cycle. We had our in-cycle transfer delayed due to OHSS but didn't find out until my feet were in the stirrups. That left us with two day three 8-3s to freeze (compared to 40 follicles on my monitoring cycle). The first FET was a negative beta. The second embryo didn't survive thawing so I found out as I was putting my shoes on to leave the house for the transfer (after three+ weeks of prep). So now the doctors, who I was *just* telling my therapist I'm ok with not worrying about my emotions, are telling me they understand that I might want to take a break after such terrible results. 

He brought up IUIs and was feeling like they're not worth much. That's when we got into a lot of confusion over medicated IUIs vs unstimulated IUIs. 

My view of the commitment for IUIs was pretty different since the clinic we were at prescribed us unmedicated IUIs. They were really cheap and *really* simple (I did home monitoring so there was only one visit to the clinic and then my beta). That's what I had in mind for this summer until the weather turns and I start to run out of patience again (and work up the nerve for IVF). 

While they don't usually do these and can't even offer me stats, they understand my bias towards them since we had the CP from one. Mr mL numbers are also better now than our initial tests so it's not so absurd. My luteal phases might be up to 12 days from 10, but we're going to do progesterone support to be sure (and it will suck less because it's not PIO and I still have 18 days of endometrin from my first cancelled transfer). I feel like getting stimulated is the annoying part of IVF, so doing a medicated IUI is not really ""better"" from a wear-and-tear perspective.

I think a lot of their agreement is about keeping me a happy customer, but from my perspective, I get to take a break without taking a break. And when the matter-of-fact, unemotional doctors (not uncompassionate, just being paid for something else) start to worry about my emotional well-being based on reading the cold facts of my last history, *it's time for a break*. 

I greatly amused the fellow by saying that the subreddit was keeping me sane and super-informed and he was just so stunned one of his patients had mentioned reddit. He said he'd poked his head into some forums before and not been impressed, but thought it was awesome what y'all have going here, what with the banned acronyms and such (when I mentioned the nickname for embryos he said ""I've seen that. I threw up in my mouth a little.""). 

The time-traveling bit refers to the fact that they are letting me jump in in the middle of this cycle. I'm scheduled to get my surge Sunday and they can fit me in there, so it's like we got the last two weeks back instead of having to wait for day 1. Mr mL is very proud of that (the fellow said ""no"", so Mr mL just asked the RE instead). 

We decided to buy the three-pack of IUIs. It works out as 3 for the price of 2 and the thinking goes that if we get pregnant on the first go, we won't care about the extra money. (The three-packs expire if you have a live birth, so it's not as good a deal as it seems.)

It was definitely disappointing when I didn’t respond to stims back in April, but my RE said we’d wait a few weeks, check things out, and we’d be doing our IVF in late May/early June.  I was okay with this plan.  Retrieval would happen before my 39th birthday in June.  And we’d have our answer and all summer to process the results.  I taught high school for almost 10 years, and for me, the new year still begins in the fall. And come September, we’d move on to whatever life had in store for us.  


But then there’s fucking reality. 


My insulin levels tested much too high, even on Metformin. This has become an overall health issue, not just a fertility one. So, losing weight, a low-carb diet, and exercise are huge priorities, and my RE wants at least 3 months and 10% body weight worth of progress before we move on to the next IVF. As I’m sure many of you understand, this is an incredibly emotional and difficult topic for me.  I’ve struggled with my weight for years.  And adding PCOS, migraines, depression, and chronic pain from several physical injuries makes the process that much harder.  I really don’t know if I have the strength to do this right now, but I guess I have to try.


And since that news and delay wasn’t devastating enough, the 2x2cm paratubal cyst that’s just been hanging out on the edge of my right ovary for 2 years decided that *now* is the time to start rapidly growing and cause concern.  It’s up to 6x7cm. RE put me on BCP in hopes of calming it down, but if there’s growth in the next 4 weeks, it’s time for surgery to remove it.  Another fucking surgery. One that could damage my ovary. I just had polyps removed from my uterus last month. This one would be abdominal but laparoscopic.


And since the left side of my body couldn’t be left out of all the fun, that tube is now filled with fluid.  RE doesn’t know why.  We’ll deal with that next month when we decide about the cyst.


I had a plan.  I wanted to try one last time and then move on.  I was ready for it. But my reproductive system has decided playing infertility whack-a-mole is more fun than letting me find peace of mind.  I was angry and there have been some tears (especially after seeing my nephew this weekend), but I almost feel like I’m still in shock.  Like the reality of the issues and IVF delay isn’t really sinking in.  *Because I don’t know if I can handle it.*

Thankfully, some coping mechanisms have kicked in.  I realized I need some creative outlets and projects to put some energy into because my stress levels are insane. So I bought an acoustic guitar.  I don’t even know how to play, but instead of sitting up at night worrying about my life, I’m going to watch some youtube videos and fucking figure it out.  I also got some paint and craft supplies from Michael’s. It’s not quite moving on, and I should be more worried about figuring out my career and an income and other long-term things, but I’m maxed out on stress. I don’t even know if we’ll ever make it to that final IVF. So fuck it.  Fuck infertility.  I’m in survival mode right now.  I’m just praying I make it.

It’s not quite moving on, and I should be more worried about figuring out my career and an income and other long-term things, but I’m maxed out on stress. I don’t even know if we’ll ever make it to that final IVF. So fuck it.  Fuck infertility.  I’m in survival mode right now.  I’m just praying I make it.</p>

So, another rounds of appointment last week. We have our protocol (antagonist). If all go well, it will be next month. My day 20 was friday, but we could not start as the clinic needs to check with Naterra if it is possible to screen the embryons for my husband's translocation.

I started the Metformine. (I have POC, but not POCS). My husband will start sperm banking. 

I'm so afraid in a way.

In the moment, the IFV is covert by our medicare, but there is a bill, that is suppose to pass in june, that will remove all IFV from medicare. 

If we have it next month, we might be a week too last from coverage. In our Province, you can't have private insurance. I'm panicking a bit. How the feck will we afford the FIV-ICSI, Micro-TESE and the PGD. What if..... it doesnt work at all?

So far the only thing I've noticed while being on CC is I get those hot flashes I was warned about - and honestly its been nice. The weather where I live has been a little cool, and our house can be a freaking icebox sometimes. Plus, I am freeze-baby, so the hot flashes are welcome.

* Hubby getting his SA done, which he's promised will be taken care of next Wednesday (thanks, hun!)

I've included my test results [here](http://imgur.com/a/743oP) for anyone who might be interested. 

Basically, my progesterone levels have been low for years (unknown to me), but most likely hit 'rock bottom' a couple of years ago. I have a great friend who I've known since high school (i.e., referred to as my doctor below) who started a wellness practice, and has been wanting to test my hormone/progesterone levels for a long time. Finally, last fall I took the test--it was a salivary test that had 28 specific date/time collections over the course of the month. From the first set of results, you can see how low my progesterone was. 

After we received the results, my doctor played around with different daily doses: 50mg, 200mg, 150mg, 200mg. We settled on 100mg because that's what seemed to be the best for me.

We just retested with a shortened version of the test (see the second image) and my levels look just as my doctor expected: elevated for the first half of the month, and leveled out for the second half. This is a good indication that we're on the right track for addressing my progesterone deficiency. We are going to reduce my progesterone to 50mg/day for Days 1-14, and 100mg/day for Days 15-25 of my cycle. 

According to my doctor, had my progesterone levels been where they should have been, she thinks that I would have gotten pregnant during those two years of IUI. I was ovulating every month, but with the low levels of progesterone, my body was not capable of completing the necessary next steps of keeping/growing a (possibly) fertilized egg.

She's encouraging me to consider trying again, but emotionally, I just don't know if I want to do it. Those two years were very hard on both me and my husband, and I'm not sure if we can do it again. Right now, I'm just so GD thankful to have my health and well-being back now that my progesterone levels are straightened out. 

**I am sharing this with you all because if you're trying to conceive, but haven't had your hormone levels tested, I strongly encourage you to do so.** My tests were much more extensive than are typically found, but with good reason. Most hormone tests are sampled only once, which provides a very limited view. Hormone levels fluctuate daily and monthly, so it's important to capture a holistic view. It was so worth the time, money and effort to see how my hormones level out across the whole month.

192,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all. Just after some advice/opinions and a vent.

So basically my story is;

Firstly I've been under some extreme stress at work the past 2 years. Out of the ordinary stress. In that time I've developed a host of health issues including psoriasis, hashimotos, and seem to get sick every two months.

I'm 30 years old, reasonably healthy otherwise.

So Jan 2014 wife and I decide to start trying. October rolls round and we see a specialist as we've had no success and lo and behold my first SA was zero.

Testing is done; hormones, testosterone etc all normal. Genetic/chromosome tests all normal. Ultrasound of testes for visible obstruction. Nil found.

We schedule a second SA including a urine test (in case of retrograde) and by some miracle sperm is found in the ejaculate (nil in the urine).

So we go into first IVF cycle woth ICSI as the end goal. 

A few days in we decide to freeze a sperm sample as back up. I gove a sample. Nil sperm.

So now we plan on doing a TESA the day of wife's retrieval. However an hour prior to the TESA I was to give a sample on case it was good enough.

Day comes and again sample given. Boom! Sperm in sample. No surgery needed. We start with five eggs, two survive to day five. 

Both implanted but nil success.

Second IVF cycle started with increased dose for wife. Two days ago we go in for retrieval and I am to give a sample followed by TESA if required.

This time sample has nil. I do the TESA and nil sperm found.

On the plus wife got 12 eggs, all frozen currently.

So I'm really frustrated and confused.

I am not usually much of a ""sharer,"" but I just need some kind words from people who get it. My husband and I have been trying for our first child since July 2012. After a bunch of tests, we found that we have MFI (0% normal morphology), and so skipped straight to IVF. I've had three egg retrievals. Between the first two, there were 20 eggs retrieved, but only 1 fertilized. 

At that point, we were advised to try a donor to see if the problem was with my eggs or my husband's sperm, so we did a split cycle - 20 more eggs retrieved in one go. Half were combined with my husband's sperm, and half with a donor's. The half with my husband resulted in 0 fertilization, and the half with the donor resulted in all 10 being fertilized; 6 made it to Day 5.

***********************

Here are some things [SquirrelBoy] and I both can’t do:

* Gracefully tear bread off of a semi-cut loaf at a restaurant

* Stay uncompetitive while playing any type of game

* Have kids the old fashioned way, like most of you can/did


We are working with great doctors and have had nothing but bad news. We have thoughtfully considered all family-building options and will likely be starting IVF in the near future. Adoption, while it can be a good fit for others, is not a good fit for us and that’s OK. We’re lucky that [SquirrelBoy] and I are on the same page about what we want and what our limits are.

In the meantime, here are some things [SquirrelBoy] and I both can do:

* Be happy for you and your families, while sometimes feeling sad for ourselves at the same time. Seeing you guys so happy gives us something to hope for; please keep sharing this part of your lives with us.

* Feel hurt when people minimize what we’ve been going through. Treat us like you would treat any friend who has a chronic medical condition, like IBS or epilepsy—you probably wouldn’t tell them that “this is God’s will”, “relax and take a vacation and you’ll be cured”, or “be happy about this because you can still…”. Most of the time we just want people to ask how we’re doing, recognize that this sucks, and be here for us if we need it. Please don’t be offended or pry if we say that we don’t want to talk about it.

* Help others feel less alone. Infertility affects an estimated one in eight—statistically, you know lots of other people who struggle with this too, but no one talks about it. I know I struggled to write this. If you’re also part of the one in eight, know that we’re giving you a fist pump in the air in support.

He's been taking FertilAid supplements more frequently, and just got another SA where his count is now 25mil! We were not expecting that.

My thyroid was slightly high (2.9, they like 2.5 or less), so they started me on a pill for that, but I'm not sure that would be the cause of our infertility. 

They actually didn't even request to check my progesterone, I had to ask them a couple times and then they requested my old results and said that was good enough. From what I've read, sometimes one test result is not clear enough.

I'm meeting with my RE next friday for a reconsult. Could my issues just be pretty much from progesterone? I have read about symptoms of low progesterone and nothing really stands out for me. 

Could there be something else? Are there any other tests I should look into? I'm guessing my RE will give me something for progesterone, should I wait (it will be right around or a little after my ovulation time when I see her) or order a cream myself?

**Him**: 1st SA very low count, 2.2MM total--volume 3.1,  57% motility, 14% morphology (WHO criteria). 2nd SA ""too few to count"" per lab.  Pending SA and hormone labs with urologist.




She recommended waiting to hear what the urologist says, which will take several weeks since the urologist wants SquirrelBoy to freeze sperm with the RE's clinic prior to providing him a sample for SA, but my RE can't get him in to freeze until May 18th.

What I'd like to get is your opinion on some of the things she said, which are making me consider getting a second opinion and working with a different clinic.

* She said that women with ""thin PCOS"" are hard to stim and have a narrow window of stimming correctly--not under- or over-stimming.  In your experience, true or not true?
* The clinic is small and they do fewer cycles per year vs. other clinics in my area.  I directly asked her about her lower-than-region average live birth rate (thank you sart.org!), but she explained that her clinic takes on more complicated cases which hold down her numbers.  I appreciated her honesty, but is this a bad sign?
* Because the clinic is small, they only do IVF about 12 times a year and they batch patients together.  I get that they do this as a cost effective measure.  The earliest cycle I could even get into is August--three months from now.  Is having to wait to start a cycle to their timing, not mine, normal?
* She does progesterone support until 11wks for all of her patients.  Necessary, or overkill?

I know that I don't need a second opinion--low sperm count is low sperm count--making IVF the only way we should go.  If you've been in my shoes, do you wish you would have talked to another RE clinic prior to starting with the first RE you met with?

It was freeing to think about something besides how this might never happen for us, or if it does, what the stats on loss are like. I just refuse to let our infertility problems take away this part of who I am. 

On another note, during the two week wait, I often think about things I'd like to do if I'm not pregnant. I've spent too many months agonizing during this time, and I'm just at the point where I'm like fuck doing that to myself -- I'm gonna daydream about sushi and beer on a balcony somewhere since it's so nice outside right now!

I'm just tired of letting myself feel shitty for half the month or more.  

What do you all do to feel better, whether by habit or effort?

(Note: The caveat of course is that this is just how I feel right now. No matter how happy I am, I do feel genuine sadness, and even a sense of loss, every month when things don't work out for us.)
