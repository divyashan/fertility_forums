Post number 1: increased prolactin. the first time they tested it, my prolactin was 45, they re-checked it about a week later, and prolactin was about 54. They sent me to get an MRI and I got super scared (post number one). I went to a closed MRI first, and I honestly never thought that I would be so claustrophobic. When they put me in the tube the first time I started crying cause I felt like I was never going to get out alive (seriously not trying to be overdramatic, it's just what it felt at the time), and then the oh-so-helpful MRI tech rolled her eyes and said ""you can't be moving in the MRI, so you can't be sniffling"". Soooo I left and rescheduled for a open MRI. That time, I asked my doc for some sort of sedation, and gave me 1 pill of Valium. That combo plus my husband coming with me that time got me through the MRI. Today they told me my MRI was normal, which is a HUGE relief, although not sure where all this excess prolactin is coming from. I have a appointment with the doc in a couple of weeks. (If anyone has any advice, please let me know, thank you!)

Post number 2: bleeding after my saline sonogram. Just in case anyone else needs reassurance, I bled for 5 days after my saline sonogram. It was painless, bright red blood that was approximately 2 full squares of toilet paper every time I used the toilet. It was unnerving simply because there were more stories of people not having any significant bleeding outside of spotting, and here I was bleeding like I had a period. So in case someone finds this post later on, you are not alone! 

Also, I just wanted to say - thank you, thank you, THANK YOU to everyone who responded to my previous posts. You ladies are amazing and your words of encouragement really helped to calm down my nerves. I don't really have anyone to talk to here about this stuff, so I am glad I have you guys. My husband is super sweet and listens, but he just doesn't GET IT, you know? So thank you again, you are all amazing.

So I don&#39;t have any conclusive info on why this is happening, but it is getting better. I haven&#39;t been feeling it nearly as much today. I&#39;m worried about the high white blood cell count but my primary care doc called me with the results at 5pm and asked me to follow up with RE. Since they were already closed I&#39;m stuck wondering what&#39;s going on for the weekend :(</p>

There's been a few roll calls recently as the sub has grown and new members have joined.  But it occurs to me that there aren't too many men (or at least active posters).  That's cool and I know that there is a male infertility sub, but at the same time, this sub is definitely more populated and active and I think our contributions here are valuable too.

I think men experience infertility in different ways, not only compared to women, but also in partnerships.  Absolutely not with respect to ""more or less suffering"" but just differently, whether it's stress, emotionally, internal and external pressures, physiologically, etc.

I thought maybe it'd be a good idea for the guys to say hello.  I think it'd be nice if this forum was also a place for men to engage with each other and also with women who are asking on behalf of their partners, or about their partners, etc.

So let's do a roll call?  Share whatever you want I suppose!  I'll start.  I'm (Mr)benihanacumberbatch and I share this account with my wife.  I'm 35 and in Canada (BC), but originally from Toronto (ON).  My wife is 34 and we've been on the IVF journey for about 1.5 years now.  We've been to clinics in San Francisco and in Vancouver as we've moved around.  We've got unexplained infertility which has been pretty frustrating.  We've done 2 IUIs (failed), 2 retrieval cycles (with a third on the way), with 1 failed FET.  We were both diagnosed as carriers of the same genetic defect, so we're doing PGD.  This has been super rough on our embryo yields.

What can I say?  It sucks and this whole process has been a real kick in the face, but what can you do?  We still have hope that this will turn out but as time goes on, I feel like we've become more pragmatic about life.

I'm always happy to answer questions about whatever I can, from anybody, about IF stuff.  I am very happy this community exists because I feel like we could all benefit from being more open about things.  For example, I just did a frozen sample deposit this morning as a backup (I have to travel a lot for work).  What's there to really say about that?  Super awkward and weird?  Yes!

I've tried not to think about it all for a long time, so I may have some dates off!


I guess my long story is that around early 2011 my husband and I decided to begin trying to start a family.  It was a slow start because I had to get cardiologist approval because I have marfans syndrome. However,  we were finally given the go ahead and tried for about a year.  Because we had no success and had concerns about passing marfans on, a family member who was a medical student and had worked with a REI doctor suggested we get an appointment and investigate PGD to solve both problems. That was of course a long process too through which we finally found out insurance want going to help but we qualified for attain and began. We also found out my husband had some issues on his side. The first cycle (around summer 2012) they did the PGD tests and all but 2 were positive and the remaining 2 had no conclusive answer. We chose to transfer those 2 and ended up with a negative result. 


After that,  we were pretty disheartened by the process and decided we would just skip PGD as marfans isn't the biggest deal, so we had 2 more cycles of IVF without PGD. One failed with no embryos to freeeze and the last was a chemical pregnancy. The last also had 5 embryos of ok-ish quality to freeze. They then did a laparoscopy in spring of 2013 and discovered I had stage 2 endometriosis.  Then, we decided to take a break and hope to get pregnant on our own by some miracle.   


In 2014, a family member with marfans became pregnant and had to have aortic root replacement,  so that scared us enough to delay using our frozen embryos. We finally decided to use them this year,  mainly because we are tired of paying the storage fees. I hoped we could go through the process without me getting my hopes up. But I'm now of course invested in the process and so hopeful. this will work.  I'm 32 and if this doesn't work I don't think we have the finances for a surrogate and I'm not sure if we will emotionally be able to go through another fresh cycle although I think we are leaving it a possibility. 


I did an ERA last cycle and everything came back good although they did clean up a polyp they found.  So my baseline blood work and ultrasound is tomorrow and I'm just trying to work through the emotions of going though this again!

I'm so sorry for the wall of text, but I really need to rant to people who can understand my situation, as no one in my close circle even knows that we're TTC. 

A little background: I'm 24 and have never been diagnosed with PCOS, but I'm 90% sure that I do indeed have it. I've been on the pill since I was 15 because of acne and period regulation, but my husband and I have been married for a little over a year now and have been TTC since October, which I know isn't a long time to be TTC, but something troubling has come up recently. 

My main concern right now is that, after coming off the pill back in September, I've since had 6 periods--only 2 of which were ""normal"" (the ones that happened right after coming off the pill). I'm currently on DAY 16 of period number 7. That's right--16 days of extremely heavy and unrelenting bleeding. The past couple days, it seemed like it was finally letting up, but then it would go a few hours and the cramps and heavy bleeding would come back, almost as if I had just restarted my period all over again. It's painful and has intensified my depression in ways I can't even describe. 

There are a couple of factors that probably have had an affect on my period:

Firstly, I've never even HAD a regular period--ever since I first got my period, it has been irregular: it wouldn't show up for 2 or 3 months, and when it would, it would stay for a week to 10 days. I was expecting this to happen when I came off the pill to TTC, but I've come to find that my period may have gotten worse than that. 

Secondly, 2016 was an extremely stressful year for me (and everyone else, it seems), as my husband and I bought a house, a new car, and started new jobs. Because of this, I pretty much skipped every period (didn't take placebo pills and went straight for the ""real"" pills in my pack) for about 6 months straight. I know this isn't ideal, but so many things kept popping up and before I knew it, it had been 6 months since I'd had a period (even though periods on the pill aren't necessarily real periods). 

Lastly (I'm sorry this is so long!!), I began the keto diet after Thanksgiving, and since then, I've lost about 22 pounds. I've heard that losing a lot of weight can jump-start your period, but this is not what I had in mind. 

Could these things be the reason for my period acting so shitty lately? Or could there be something seriously wrong with me? Does anyone have any experience with extremely long, painful periods?
What's also frustrating beyond belief, is that I can't find an OBGYN who will take me in immediately. I've never had a primary OBGYN or physician, since I only went to the free clinic up until last year when I got insurance through my new job. I don't have the money for an out-of-pocket ER visit, but, since I am a new patient, none of the OBGYNs have any appointments until March and April. I don't know what to do. This period is becoming more than I can take...it's taking a physical and emotional toll on me every single day, and every time I go to the bathroom and see that I'm still bleeding is another reminder of what a failure I am and how my body is shitty. Meanwhile, just this past week, 6 girls on my Facebook announced their pregnancies, and I know that they haven't been trying. Seeing all these accidental pregnancies popping up has been tiring and painful...it's like a slap in the face.

My last post was a super long rant about life and MAN did it feel good to just get it out there. Thanks for everyone that responded with love and support. I had a suspicion that a lot of you probably felt the things I was feeling as well, but it was still a little scary putting it all out in the open.

I'm so very happy the holidays are done. I get to avoid family for a little while and all their petty crap (yay!) and focus on our own lives. We start the FET process all over again pretty soon. I'm currently on birth control, start shots in a week or so, and the transfer is on February 27th. It felt really surreal when we went back to the fertility clinic this time around. It was ... sucky.

Another sucky thing–all the dang bleeding. UGH. My first period after the D&C was really light, which was expected. This second period, though? OMG. The first round (yep) lasted almost 2 full weeks and it was ALL heavy/normal bleeding. No spotting, nuh uh. Straight up blood all day long. I had to eat a lot of extra steak those 2 weeks losing all that blood! Then it was gone. And 4 days later, last Friday, the second round came in. Mostly spotting, but consistent all-day spotting. Just ended today. WTF body. Figure it out!

We have no reason to think that this next transfer won't work since all of our tissue & genetic testing showed all 100% normal everything. But if it doesn't work, I don't know what I'll do. I'm just trying not to let my mind go there. I'm also trying not to let my mind go towards getting excited. So... I guess I'm just going through it numb. I'm sure many of you know how it goes. Yay. I'm looking forward to doing all those old wives tales again, that calmed some of my nerves knowing I was doing everything I could after the transfer. I think I did brazil nuts, warm feet, pomegranate juice, avocados, pineapple core, leg bicycles, and lots of laughter.

So I guess that's it. A rambling random update. <3

You can claim on your income tax the following medical expenses. I'm not a tax expert but I've done my own research and this is what I've come up with. If you're married/common law, the lower income earner should claim all medical expenses on their return.

IVF/IUI fees to the clinic - includes IVF/IUI procedures, cryopreservation, embryo storage, etc

OOP tests - for example, we paid for an antibodies sperm test

OOP meds - include whatever your insurance didn't cover (if you have insurance)

Travel expenses if your clinic more than 40km from your home (check out the details on CRAs website). This includes vehicle mileage, hotel, meals, and parking.

I overheard my husband talking to one of my friends who works in his field (dentistry) that his assistant is pregnant (also not totally sure it was even appropriate of him to bring up to a woman in the middle of an IVF cycle, but I guess I'd have had to hear it for context).  I shrugged it off, but days later remembered it and asked when he was planning to tell me.  I've so far stopped by once a month with goodies, and I happen to have the day off tomorrow.  At some point I was going to stop in, and find out that way?!  This assistant is basically a puppy in human form.  She would have told me in a bouncy way, and I would have been PISSED.  I am pissed.

I won't be stopping by with goodies anytime soon, and I certainly will not be baking for her shower.


Second, tonight we found mold in our closet while moving boxes, on the wall that backs up to our shower.  I'm hoping it's JUST a leak in the wall, but am afraid of shoddy workmanship where the person remodeling the bathroom (we bought this house a year ago but the bathroom was remodeled maybe 5 years ago) didn't put a moisture barrier in.  So maybe it'll be a cheap fix, but I'm bracing myself for an emergency remodel.  And if that's the case, I know the other bathroom was done at the same time, and will probably have to have everything ripped out in there too.  I'm beside myself worrying about this.  We don't really have backup funds right now, because in the span of 4 months, $5k OOP has gone to my RE, $1k went to insurance and car rentals when my husband crashed my car (we were technically hit, but I'm still mad because we got hit in the first place because we were in the wrong place because he made a wrong turn).


And this is small, but I bought some essential oils today at our local crunchy store for my diffuser.  Husband left them in the bottom of the grocery bag and threw them out, because he wasn't paying attention.  He dug them out, but I'm so upset he just doesn't pay attention and literally threw out $20.


And then I found out he dismantled a Christmas decoration I'd said multiple times I'd like stored intact, so now I have to recreate it next year from all the parts (it was two hurricanes filled with varied ornaments that were carefully arranged).  It literally would have taken some Saran wrap to keep it together, and now I have to do it all over again next year.


I'm so fucking worried about money right now.  And also really bitter.  I had a consult with California Closets scheduled that due to this shower thing I'm going to have to cancel, because we're not going to have any money for this anytime soon. I was really hoping to remodel my laundry room and pantry, get a coffee table that matches our new couch we bought in August, and buy a dining room table in the next 4 months.  Now I'm wondering if we'll even get to do any of that in 2017.

I think I get more confused every time I talk to my RE, so thought I'd bring a couple of my questions here. 

I'm specifically thinking about meds. 

Background: Going into my first Clomid cycle next month after just over a year trying and 6 months of being lazy about birth control before that. No luck at all so far. We're both 36, normal SA and CD3 bloodwork, but my 7DPO progesterone was low (7.1) so looks like weak ovulation. Also, my cycles are variable length (29-38 days), but that last one with the 7DPO test was a nice 29 day one. Anyway, so at first my RE didn't want to supplement my progesterone because I didn't have a luteal phase defect (my luteal phase is 10-11 days), but when I asked why not she basically said okay, here's a prescription, and wrote an order to test progesterone again this month. 

So here are my questions:

Should I wait to take the supplemental progesterone until I see how the Clomid affects my progesterone? Should I wait and not take it this month either (currently CD13 and haven't ovulated yet) to see if last month's result was a fluke? Or would you worry less about figuring out what's going on, and just take both and hope for the best?

Also, I stopped taking my SSRI when we started TTC, but I'm worried about how Clomid will impact my mental health. I never could take birth control pills because it made my depression and anxiety worse. I stopped taking the SSRI because I was afraid it would make it harder for me to conceive, but I'm not sure how likely that actually is to make a difference.

Any thoughts or advice?

I have secondary recurrent pregnancy loss (stillbirth at 37 weeks followed by miscarriage at 6 weeks). I have had previous success.

I could try to leave well enough alone but my arms ache from my stillbirth. We have the nursery still set up, new clothes, diapers, etc. Seeing babies the age he should be devastates me, making it hard to leave the house.

I want to try again at some point but I want all of the testing first. I don't want to try again if the risks are high. I never got tested after the stillbirth, except an autopsy that showed delayed villous maturation of the placenta. I had HELLP syndrome in my first pregnancy. I have had day 3 and 21 tests at the RE, all normal:  low FSH, AMH 4.9, I'm 33. I do have oligomenorrhea with long cycles and late ovulation (33-42 day cycles). I get fewer tries per year than the average gal. Also, if I fail I get to wait eons to try again. SA normal for my husband (35 yrs).

I'm thinking either immune or clotting factors may be at play, maybe even HY antibodies because all my pregnancies were male (can't say on the miscarriage obviously). 

Where should I go to get the best, most thourough testing done? Price and location don't matter; I could make it work.

What was your process in learning to self administer needles? Did the IVF clinic show you how? If so, how much time was spent on that? Did you do a test needle like inject yourself with saline?

Also there was a clever idea posted the other day, about using a behind-the-door shoe organizer (clear plastic) to organize meds? How have you gotten organized? What worked and what failed? 

Also it seems from some of the chit chat that needles are not bought from the IVF clinic but rather from the pharmacy.  Is this true? I have never seen needles for sale -- do they only come when you order the meds or do you order them separately?

For the pharmacy -- are fertility meds ordered from a special pharmacy or just your ordinary regular pharmacy?

I'm not new to dealing with infertility meds but I am new to ivf, it's a lot of new things to learn. I know many members of this subreddit are experienced with ivf so I hope this is an appropriate place to post my questions.

I am on day 5 of stimulation injections for my first ivf cycle (short protocol, I didn't do any down regulation) and although my period ended a few days ago I just suddenly started bleeding again today.   The blood is bright red and heavier than what I would consider ""spotting."" I went in early this morning for an ultrasound and a blood test and I mentioned I had seen some blood to the nurse then. She said I shouldn't be bleeding at this point in the cycle and that she would pass the information on to the doctor. Interestingly, the nurse commented that my lining looked great on the ultrasound, and was at 10mm.  As of yet I've heard nothing back from the clinic, I called earlier and left a message saying the bleeding has increased, but the clinic has just closed. 

Have any of you experienced bleeding during the ivf stim period? Is it something I should be concerned about?

My second question is about whats ""typical"" for follicle development. I know everyone is different but I'm a bit concerned about where I'm at, follicle wise. My day 5 ultrasound showed two 15mm, one 13mm and one 11mm. The nurse said that there were ""others that are 10mm or under"" but at my clinic they don't count these or report them to you until they're larger. Should I be concerned that this is how I'm responding at day 5? There's only 4 notable follicles and I'm worried that the two 15mm may be too dominant for only being 5 days in.  

If it helps at all for background information, I am 23 years old with a diagnosis of stage 3-4 endometriosis. I've had three laparoscopic surgeries in the past to deal with the endo, the most recent was in September 2016. We have been trying with monitored cycles for over a year with no success.  My AMH level is 12pmol/L.  At my baseline ultrasound before we started stims they counted 15+ follicles in one ovary and 8 in the other. The first three days I started with my meds low, 75 menopur and 150 gonal f, and then the last two days my clinic has upped it to 225 menopur and 225 gonal f. I added in orgalutran to prevent ovulation the past three days.  

Does this sound like a cycle that could successfully make it to egg retrieval? I've tried looking online for information but haven't found much that's helpful. Thank you!

<p>She currently has health insurance that covers IVF treatment, but up to $25,000 and she may be laid off in a few months (massive company is making drastic changes). Our concern is...if we have to pay for IVF services out of pocket, what is the typical costs? I&#39;ve heard anywhere from $10,000 to $80,000. </p>

I used to be an active participant in a couple of Facebook groups, but after three failures with PGS-tested embryos, I was starting to feel like the damned amongst those cursed with infertility...it seemed like most of the women on there were finding success with one, or at most, two of these supposedly golden PGS embryos.

We've been doing IVF because my husband has a Robertsonian translocation, and we've never conceived naturally. Up until recently they hadn't found anything on my end. With our first doctor, we lost two embryos, but he refused to perform an ERA because he ""doesn't believe in them."" (?!) And the second doctor didn't feel strongly about it, but he was willing to do it by building it into my stimulation cycle. His protocol for me is somewhat unconventional in that you start injections during the tail end of your luteal phase (has anyone else done this?).

To do the ERA, he allowed my follicular phase to happen naturally, and then when I was nearing ovulation, he administered the first PIO shot right then and there so that he would know when progesterone first hit my system. He then had me trigger with HCG, take suppositories for a few days, and do the biopsy at the 5 day mark. A few days later I started injections for the fresh cycle.

I agreed to do it this way because I really felt like my results would come back normal. But I ended up with a ""post-receptive"" result. We are now faced with some confusing decisions. From my fresh cycle, I ended up with 4 blastocysts of questionable quality. Unfortunately, 4 is not a great result for having a translocation - statistically there's a good chance we could end up with no genetically normal ones. So we are thinking of doing another fresh cycle to bank more...my doctor is saying we can do the second ERA the same way or do it as a mock transfer cycle. I'm leaning towards the latter just for the sake of peace of mind, but it means a much longer timeline.

Overall, I'm torn between feeling hope (a very dangerous feeling for an infertility patient!) about having a potential reason for our failures and fear/dread that this result is actually bogus because of the way my doctor did the test.

We have been trying to conceive for 2.5 years. After 6 months of trying I had a missed miscarriage at almost 10 weeks followed by a D&C. After the D&C I started spotting before my period and my periods became really long. Three months later I had a chemical pregnancy and my period has been off the rails ever since. I start spotting 8-9 DPO, have periods of about 6 days, followed by more spotting which means bleeding of some sort for 13 days. The bleeding is driving me up the wall.

Last year I tried acupuncture and temping for about 4-5 months. The temping showed I don’t get a very good ovulation spike and my temps are not super high after ovulation (indications of progesterone deficiency I know). The acupuncturist managed to pinch a nerve in my foot and stressed me out more than anything else, so I decided to move on to the real drugs.

I have had Day 2 tests (FSH, estrogen, thyroid, ovarian reserve) all of which were normal, so normal that my RE did not see the point in a Day 21 progesterone test, or an HSG as I was pregnant once before (husband checks out ok). I have had multiple ultrasounds (just normal ones), which don’t show anything abnormal, though I once had a uterine cyst show up at the end of a cycle, but it went away with my period.

After two cycles of FSH injectables and TI, in the hopes that spotting was caused by crappy ovulation, the spotting/long periods have not changed at all. Ultrasound follicle measurements were good and followed by an HCG trigger shot. I also used progesterone suppositories during the last cycle, after pressing my RE, but he prescribed them only twice a week, which seems unheard of to me, and of course it ended up making no difference.

Does anyone have experience with their cycle changing after a D&C? Or success with progesterone helping their luteal phase?

I have been stressed, depressed, and lonely for the two years since the miscarriage. I finally feel like I am moving forward emotionally and am ready to do whatever I can keep moving in the right direction. Thanks for listening!

Hi.

My husband and I have been trying (with all of the tracking and timing and that jazz) for 12 months now after removing my non-hormonal IUD last January. We just got some preliminary testing done, ordered by my regular GYN. So far, we know:

 * I seem to have a standard-issue female reproductive system for a 29-year old. Aside from a small fibroid on the outside of my uterus and a small cyst in the myometrium (suggestive of adenomyosis myositis), everything else (that we've tested) is to spec - size, position, thickness of the lining, tubes fully open, ovulating normally, normal amounts of hormones. This is based on bloodwork from CD4 and 6DPO (timing got in the way of the usually CD3 and 7DPO schedule), an HSG, and a pelvic ultrasound.
 * Mercifully, I have no sign of the thyroid issues that seem to run in my family.
 * My husband seems to make a normal amount of motile sperm with normal morphology levels, but his one SA showed ""moderate"" agglutination.

Obviously we're going to be following up on a lot. I expect we'll both have a fair bit more poking and prodding before we're through. Our first meeting with the RE is in about 2 weeks.

Oh, right - we're both 29 and live in NJ with our ridiculously fluffy cat, coming up on 11 years together.

Some questions. 

The first quick question -- ""WTF"" appointment. That stands for what-the-fuck? Or why-that-failed? 

Next

Everyone talks about having different or similar drug protocols. I get the general concept that different meds are used in different situations -- for example, a group of drugs called agonists are used for ""downregulation to prevent OHSS"". 

Even though I am able to quote that phrase, though, I don't actually understand it. I don't understand the big picture. 

Reading here has confused me even more because members compare their different drugs by name.  

There seems to be a huge gap between the information from USA fertility clinics and scholarly articles. Not sure how to educate myself in order to fill the gap. 

Is this something that can only be learned by doing?

I have advanced maternal age, so we will mostly likely be proceeding straight to IVF after we explore husband's fertility status. I may even just freeze my eggs if it looks like we need some time to deal with any male fertility issues (not sure how crazy that is but I want to preserve my options before they are lost forever).

Now that I'm back into it, I wanted to post about what's going on with me and see if anyone out there can relate or wants to share a similar experience. 




The first thing is YouTube. My husband and I have a youtube channel where we are documenting our journey and want to remember all the details, as well as helping open up a dialogue about infertility to help break the stigma. If anyone else around here also has a YouTube channel, let me know! I'd love to watch your vlogs! We posted a video about a heavy metal concert [fundraiser](https://youtu.be/oh2kSDx9cUU) for IVF we had in December. Then posted a [vlog](https://youtu.be/kIba2q17kNo) last week when I had a laparoscopic surgery to have both fallopian tubes removed because they were both blocked and very damaged. 




That brings me to the next thing I wanted to talk about. Has anyone here had a laparoscopic surgery? Or have had their fallopian tubes removed? I am in recovery right now (six days post op) and I was trying to do too much and made my belly button incision bleed a little and my stomach area hurt more so now I am being forced to take it easy even though there are house chores to be done! UGH. So boring. Anyway, I am wondering how long it usually takes to heal up from a laparoscopic procedure and heal from having things inside removed? They did a hysteroscopy to make sure the tubes couldn't be fixed before taking them out, and I think because of that I am still bleeding. I'm kind of annoyed I'm not healing faster because I am super impatient. 




So, with all the stress of financing fertility treatments, and all the medical procedures, and dealing with friends and family and people on social media that can sometimes be not as understanding as we want them to be, what are some ways you try to stay positive? What gets you through those days that are harder than others? I used to shop for baby stuff and plan things like nursery decor and photo ideas and other baby raising stuff but lately that stuff feels like I'm working towards something that might not even happen and that I'm getting my hopes up for more disappointment... Sorry to be a debbie downer. I just like, I don't know. I feel like people in this forum might understand what I'm feeling.

They did a hysteroscopy to make sure the tubes couldn&#39;t be fixed before taking them out, and I think because of that I am still bleeding. I&#39;m kind of annoyed I&#39;m not healing faster because I am super impatient. </p>

<p>So, with all the stress of financing fertility treatments, and all the medical procedures, and dealing with friends and family and people on social media that can sometimes be not as understanding as we want them to be, what are some ways you try to stay positive? What gets you through those days that are harder than others? I used to shop for baby stuff and plan things like nursery decor and photo ideas and other baby raising stuff but lately that stuff feels like I&#39;m working towards something that might not even happen and that I&#39;m getting my hopes up for more disappointment... Sorry to be a debbie downer. I just like, I don&#39;t know. I feel like people in this forum might understand what I&#39;m feeling.</p>

<p>I hope everyone is having a great day! </p>

So on Monday morning when we all arrived (I have a GC) my doctor told me I only had one blasto. And it wasn't the best graded one either. I believe it was a 4BB. I had one other that looked like it was almost like a half-blasto if that makes sense.

The other 4 were arrested and they told me they would keep them one more day to see if they improved, but they didn't make it. 

So anyway I guess I am disheartened because I thought I was doing SO well with my 14 eggs and when it came time to transfer I only had 1 low grade blasto.

And then I go on Facebook, and those sarcastic mother posts are everywhere, and they bitch and moan about their kids and about how people without kids aren't even tired, because as we all know, we sleep well and lounge around all day.

Then I accidentally stumbled into an IF Facebook group I thought I'd left, and there are scan *videos* and baby's in Christmas outifts to give hope to the rest of us over Christmas.

I didn't know semi-precious stones cured infertility, so there you go. But baby dust apparently helps so why am I surprised?

And then people get added and say things like ""I took a test but it was negative, maybe too early. I'm 1dpo"" and I want to scream because you just know once they get a clue they'll be pregnant in no time.

So screw you Facebook as well.

This past weekend my mom and her husband came to visit. There was never a time that seemed right or with just my mom and I to talk to her about the serious stuff, so nothing was said. My birthday was Sunday though and ""step-sister"", we'll call her Anne for simplicity, sent my mom a text with a video of her daughter, Jane, being coaxed through telling me ""happy birthday aunt JessieBooBoo"". I smiled through it and handed the phone back to my mom, I think I mustered up a ""thanks"" even. 

Later that night, over dinner, they mention that Anne won't even come back home ever because her brothers have threatened her life and while she was pregnant, threatened to cut the baby out of here. I also found out that none of the sons are talking to their dad or my mom anymore (I thought it was just the youngest that did this). One son is married with a child and said kid apparently doesn't know ""grandma"" and grandpa exist. 

I feel bad for Anne because it seems she's now looking to have some semblance of a family and maybe I could be some normal part of that. But I also am in no state of mind to deal with someone that interacts with the world only through their child, whether it's videos/pictures of the child or only talking of their child. Oh, and yesterday she posted on facebook ""anyone want a toddler?"". Yes, desperately, I just paid a pharmacy $3k to just hope for one, are you giving one away?

<p>This past weekend my mom and her husband came to visit. There was never a time that seemed right or with just my mom and I to talk to her about the serious stuff, so nothing was said. My birthday was Sunday though and &quot;step-sister&quot;, we&#39;ll call her Anne for simplicity, sent my mom a text with a video of her daughter, Jane, being coaxed through telling me &quot;happy birthday aunt JessieBooBoo&quot;. I smiled through it and handed the phone back to my mom, I think I mustered up a &quot;thanks&quot; even. </p>

<p>Later that night, over dinner, they mention that Anne won&#39;t even come back home ever because her brothers have threatened her life and while she was pregnant, threatened to cut the baby out of here. I also found out that none of the sons are talking to their dad or my mom anymore (I thought it was just the youngest that did this). One son is married with a child and said kid apparently doesn&#39;t know &quot;grandma&quot; and grandpa exist. </p>

<p>I feel bad for Anne because it seems she&#39;s now looking to have some semblance of a family and maybe I could be some normal part of that. But I also am in no state of mind to deal with someone that interacts with the world only through their child, whether it&#39;s videos/pictures of the child or only talking of their child. Oh, and yesterday she posted on facebook &quot;anyone want a toddler?&quot;. Yes, desperately, I just paid a pharmacy $3k to just hope for one, are you giving one away?</p>

<p>To recap: I still never talked to my mom about any of it, her husband&#39;s family is nuts or think my mom and him are nuts and their sister is nuts, I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t want to be involved in any of it.

Two things that are not up for discussion is announcement of pregnancy (ex. “first beta was 308, second was 724 and u/s in in 2 weeks!”) or status updates of an ongoing pregnancy (“Just passed viability day and I’m thrilled this is really happening!”) We sincerely share your joy in these successes, but they need to be confined to the results section.


**1) mention of treatment that led to successful pregnancy in the past, usually in response to someone who is seeking opinions about treatment.**

Example: We switched to an antagonist protocol and got tons more eggs, and luckily one of them is now my two year old daughter.


**2) mention of treatment that led to an ongoing pregnancy** 

Example: We got more aggressive and did IUI with injectables and it worked, and I’m currently 10w5d so fingers crossed.

**3) mention of treatment that led to a pregnancy that was lost at some point**

Example: My first IUI worked but unfortunately lost the pregnancy at 8 weeks.


**4) Vague mention of pregnancy**

Examples: We got pregnant after adding in HGH to stims, or we switched to an antagonist protocol and it worked, or we moved on to donor sperm and so far so good. 


**5) discussion of ""beta hell""**

Example: My first beta was low at 52 and second one two days later was only 68, but third was 120 so I was kind of hopeful. Then I had an u/s at 5w6d and they saw a sac but no heartbeat, but maybe it’s too early to tell. Ugh this is killing me, I want this so bad.

<p>Two things that are not up for discussion is announcement of pregnancy (ex. “first beta was 308, second was 724 and <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a> in in 2 weeks!”) or status updates of an ongoing pregnancy (“Just passed viability day and I’m thrilled this is really happening!”) We sincerely share your joy in these successes, but they need to be confined to the results section.</p>

<p><strong>1) mention of treatment that led to successful pregnancy in the past, usually in response to someone who is seeking opinions about treatment.</strong></p>

<p>Example: We switched to an antagonist protocol and got tons more eggs, and luckily one of them is now my two year old daughter.</p>

<p><strong>2) mention of treatment that led to an ongoing pregnancy</strong> </p>

<p>Example: We got more aggressive and did IUI with injectables and it worked, and I’m currently 10w5d so fingers crossed.</p>

<p><strong>3) mention of treatment that led to a pregnancy that was lost at some point</strong></p>

<p>Example: My first IUI worked but unfortunately lost the pregnancy at 8 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>4) Vague mention of pregnancy</strong></p>

<p>Examples: We got pregnant after adding in HGH to stims, or we switched to an antagonist protocol and it worked, or we moved on to donor sperm and so far so good. </p>

<p><strong>5) discussion of &quot;beta hell&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Example: My first beta was low at 52 and second one two days later was only 68, but third was 120 so I was kind of hopeful. Then I had an <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a> at 5w6d and they saw a sac but no heartbeat, but maybe it’s too early to tell. Ugh this is killing me, I want this so bad.</p>

<p><em>Please reply to this post with your vote, and again for clarity, vote a simple yes/no on each point, and discussion should happen elsewhere.</em> If you want to change your vote based on discussion, that’s fine. :) Mods will e-meet at the end of the week for final discussion so please get your vote on!</p>

<li><p>Take another biopsy 1 day later than before.  That&#39;s another $870 right there.  And another month spent on a mock cycle.  </p></li>
<li><p>Go ahead with a transfer, but 2 days later than the biopsy was done.  The chances are very good that by then I would be &quot;In Phase&quot;.  At first he said he&#39;d only transfer 1 embryo again to spread the risk, but then he said he could understand using 2, and hemmed and hawed more.  So another choice to make there.  Blergh.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Have any of you had to make this decision and what did you choose?  My lining was thick enough this morning that I can start progesterone this week for either option.  Just have to decide.</p>

I feel like I can´t do this anymore. Everything is going so wrong. What has happend to my life?

1. We figured out that our AMH was given to us in another scale unit than the one usually used everywhere. So my AMH isn´t actually 0.7 but coverted to the regular measurements it´s 0.1. That´s a huge difference. I cried the whole night when we realised this. certainly helps me understand my old RE´s hopelesness. I mean 0.1! It´s practically over, right?

2. I had a follicle growing last this cycle. RE agreed to trigger ovulation once it was big enough. It´s not much, but I mean, you only need one follicle, right? 
But then I felt a sharp pain and it looks like I bled into the follicle. Oestrogen is down. Nothing´s going to happen this cycle.  It still hurts on my left side. 

3. Had an MRI before christmas to check if my benign little brain tumor has grown. Neuroradiologist (who´s new on my case) said no growth, but today, my neurosurgeon ( who´s been on my case since the beginning) called. He says the tumor has grown an bit. Just a tiny bit. But it means that it´s not a stable tumor and it needs to be taken out. It compresses my brainstem a bit but as I´m symptom free, we can still wait with the surgery. A surgery would mean we´d be benched for several months because I´d need medication after surgery that is not compatible with pregnancy. I explained our situation (DOR, we don´t have much time left, if any) to the neurosurgeon and he understands (he hints that he and his wife have gone through infertility). He says it´s ok to wait as long as I don´t have any symptoms or the next MRI shows growth. But we should definitely call him if our IF-issues have resolved (hopefully in a baby). I fear that´s not going to happen anytime, soon. 

4. My contract at work has run out. My professional status has changed so we have to set up a new contract. But despite all the great words, my employers ( a small private practice) are hesitant to give me the same contract again. They want me to work there independently which would mean a high financial risk and a lot of paper work. I´m not a lawyer but I also think, th contract has some points in it that I can´t possible sign. I think they are somehow scared that I might get pragnant and they would be stuck with my workload. I called around to put the word out that I might be looking for another position and all I´ve heard is that everyone is looking for people who will stay long term. Nobody wants to hire people who could get pregnant anytime. (I know it´s not legal, but there´s really not much to do about it). Ha! If only they knew that pregnancy is an extremly unlikely ""risk"" in my case. 

So: I have difficulties getting a good work contract because in the eyes of society, I´m still fertile. But of course, I´m not really. I´m delaying neurosurgery in the hope of getting pregnant. But of course, I won´t. Right? I´m feeling particularly hopeless!

It´s been really long since I´ve gotten some good news. I feel like I´m useless and I´m alternating between feeling depressed and empty. 

I really really want some good news. I really really need a lucky break. Just something that goes well. Anything!

Background: 
My husband and I have been TTC for over a year and have diagnosed male factor infertility. We have been very open with our family about this. I am 26.

My brother is 24 and is in his first proper relationship. He met a girl online last summer, met in August. She is 22 and has two young children (both under 3). They don't have a relationship with their father because he was abusive.

In October, she had a pregnancy scare (I only know this because my brother and I share a mutual best friend). My brother was relieved it was just a scare. The following month, they found out she was pregnant. My brother was so very tactful when he told me, let me cry on him, he was brilliant. His girlfriend later got angry at him for the attention he was giving me when she said she was crying too but he wasn't paying her any attention. When left alone, she gave me a hug and then looked at her phone and said ""OMG did you know there's only like three days a month you can even get pregnant? What are the odds?!"". Ouch.

I've been doing my best to avoid her and to not let my brother know that I think she is a manipulative piece of work. But last night she made as really hurtful comment that I thought I would share with you (two in fact!).

My brother put a pregnancy announcement on Facebook, which I shared and said ""Wahey another niece or nephew to look forward to"" (my older brother has a baby, my gorgeous little nephew). She commented straight away saying ""Nephew. If it's a girl, I'm selling her!"". I was honestly speechless. Firstly it's really fucking insulting to the daughter she already has (she has one of each) because she's saying that her behaviour is so bad she doesn't want another one. It's also a comment that's been publicly made when there's a 50% chance she will have a daughter, and people will know she didn't want one. But lastly, who the FUCK says that to somebody who they know is unable to have a baby? She's such an ungrateful little bitch.

After I managed to compose myself I just put ""Well I will take her off your hands"", and she said ""Auntie K definitely has a ring to it"" - my older brother has gone apeshit because this comment seems to completely disregard that his son, my nephew, already exists.

I might be being oversensitive because she is constantly making these comments so maybe I just read too much into them. But seriously is this something a normal person would do?!


EDIT: I should probably add that I am not jealous that she's pregnant; my older brothers girlfriend also got pregnant whilst my husband and I were struggling and I was there every step of the way with her, because she is a decent human being (and now one of my best friends, also supporting me through this shit!).",t2_xg7mc,False,,0,False,I hate my pregnant 'SIL',[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_5mwo0w,False,dark,0.9,,public,16,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,16,,False,self,1483952911.0,,[],{},,True,,1483980939.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This probably makes me sound awful but I this vile woman has really pushed me to the edge!

She&#39;s doing a hysteroscopy tomorrow and that should act like a scratch and boost my lining some, but I had a scratch last time too.  Any advice? </p>

One of her ovaries was removed. She got pregnant even though she was using a hormonal intra-uterine device (IUD). Turns out that although this device is known to be one of the most effective methods for birth control currently on the market, it also increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy.

My question to any woman around here who has had one ovary removed in the past (> 1 year): how are you doing today? Do you suffer from long-time consequences? I read that there's a risk of having problems related to a hormonal imbalance, which can result in premature menopause.

&nbsp;

We had just spent four hours watching the extended edition with friends. With hobbits plus my cervical fluid status on my side, I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.

&nbsp;

""I've had like six drinks,"" he said, which I should've noticed, given that he and his friend had been quoting the movie with increasing volume, frequency, and jubilance. ""Are you sure it's necessary?""

""Pretty sure.""

""Ok. I'll give it my best.""

&nbsp;

Oh, IT WAS ON. We moved things to the comfort of the bedroom, where we quietly removed our own excess jewelry and outer layers of clothing. We met in the middle of the room. We embraced and lightly kissed. Things were really heating up now. 

&nbsp;

After ten minutes of trying outwardly to do everything that typically sparks a fire, while inwardly we both hummed the LOTR theme and alphabetized our to-do lists, we pulled out the big guns. I dug through the bottom of my dresser, beneath the Batman boxers of yesteryear and those gym shorts I forgot I still had, and grabbed the Daisy Dukes I had made from the jeans I was wearing when we first started dating. I blew off a layer of dust and tried them on. Still fit!

&nbsp;

Now we were really rolling. The old girls had done their job, and the sluggishness of alcohol was wearing off. He grabbed me and pulled me to him.

&nbsp;

""Ouch!"" I yelled.

""What? What?""

""I'm sorry, I kind of tweaked my shoulder earlier today,"" I said. ""While I was twisting around to pinch my back fat,"" I did not say.

""All right. I'll be extra gentle.""

&nbsp;

We were well on our way, now. Just a few more minutes and everything was going to be juuuust fine. 

&nbsp;

""Ouch!"" he said.

""What?""

""Ouch! Stop, stop, stop, stop. It's pinching.""

""What do you mean, 'pinching'?""

""I don't know. It's like everything's shaped weird in there or something. It's not like normal at all.""

""Ok,"" I said. ""Well, maybe we can just go slow? You take control and do whatever feels right. Maybe I'm just tense and things will be normal if I relax. I'll focus on relaxing. You take your time."" 

""Ok, I can do that.""

&nbsp;

Like giant tortoises of the Galapagos, we came together.

&nbsp;

""Ouch!"" I said.

""What?""

""It's like your penis is hitting something. It really, really hurts."" *

""Are you sure you want to do this?""

""Yes, of course I'm sure. It's fine. Let's just take it really slow.""

""Ok.""

&nbsp;

Like three-toed sloths of Costa Rica, we came together.

&nbsp;

""It's still pinching a bit, but I think we can do this,"" he said. ""How are you doing?""

&nbsp;

""Yeah, it's better,"" I said, because I had now begun to suspect the source of our trouble. I had been what one might call ""royally constipated"" of late, and four years of routinely checking my cervix had taught me that the intestines are disconcertingly close to the vagina, and that blockages change the shape of things. Now, I had learned back in Sex 101 that number two on the list of the Top Three Things You Never Say in Bed was ""poop,"" so instead of saying, ""I think my poop is pinning your penis against my cervix or vaginal wall,"" I said, ""Yeah, it's better.""

&nbsp;

Now we were moving toward the finish line, at the pace of a Wes Anderson ensemble doing a boss slow-walk toward self-discovery. We were cautiously going through the motions, watching out for shoulders and vaginas and penises and whatever else was sure to break down next, the silence of our quiet humping broken only by an occasional ""ouch"" from one or both of us.

&nbsp;

At this pace, we could start the extended *Return of the King* and Frodo would still get that damn ring in the fires of Mordor before we could finish our own journey. Something had to change.

&nbsp;

""You know what?"" I said. ""It doesn't hurt anymore at all.""

""Really?""

""Yeah, it's fine now.""

&nbsp;

We picked up the pace to a more results-oriented rhythm. It was excruciating now, but if I turned my head and focused hard, I could keep from grimacing and screaming. At last, like lost, drunken frat boys stumbling into a funeral parlor, his sperm poured into the dark void of my vagina. With sighs of relief, we shook hands and congratulated each other on a job done.

&nbsp;

If we ever actually get a child out of this mess, and that child someday asks me where babies come from, I'm going to have to start with, ""When a mommy and a daddy are sick of this shit...""

&nbsp;

I had an ER on Wednesday the 4th. They retrieved 14 eggs, 11 were mature and 6 fertilized. This morning they gave me the grades of my embryos. My doc uses a grading system that goes Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent. So my 6 embryos were graded and they were as follows: 1 that is Poor, 2 are Fair minus, 1 that is Fair, 1 that is Fair plus, and 1 that is Good minus. 

They told me both my doctor and the embryologist think I should wait for a 5 day transfer. When I asked them if my embryos could possibly move up to a better grade by day 5 she said that it was possible, but that it is also a possibility for them to even move down a grade. All that being said, they still recommend that I wait for a 5 day transfer which would be Monday morning at 9:00 am. I'm kind of wondering if they also suggest a 5 day transfer because I am using a GC and last time they measured her lining it was at 11.5 or 12 I think and that was last Monday so I'm guessing it is a little thicker now. Maybe they want to give my embryos a chance to grow a little because there is a higher chance that they will stick in my surro. She's had 5 successful pregnancies with no issues during any of them. I don't know, I'm just thinking aloud trying to sort things out in my brain. 

My question is I'm wondering if anyone has had embryos that have moved up in quality between day 3 and 5. Sorry I'm just freaking out a little after hearing my grades.  I know they aren't the worst but of course we always want to hope for the best. I'm second guessing and wondering if I should have pushed for a transfer today on day 3.

I've started the IVF process but for the second cycle in a row, we can't seem to get my endometrial lining above a 6. This go around I'm doing estrogen pills, injections, patches, and viagra suppositories and it was even lower than last time. 

Is there anyone out there who has had similar issues after a BMT? Or is it just a me thing? My periods before the transplant were normal, so I don't think I had issues building a normal lining before chemo. 

Also, if anyone has recommendations for ways to increase my lining, I'm all ears! Thanks for reading. 

UPDATE (140d later): Just got a 10 days Endometrial lining read of 7.6!!!! For those struggling with this, here is what I did. Hopefully it can help. I took a commenters advice and took a 3 month break doing regular HRT (Estrogen patch changed twice weekly). I started doing acupuncture at the beginning of the break (tried 3 before I found one I really liked) and have continued 1x week. I started taking herbs from my most recent acupuncturist about 3 weeks ago (for liver, kidney, and blood support). 
I really went all out this time. I bought a frozen embryo transfer meditation from Circle&Bloom that I started on day1. Each morning I read a list of affirmations while I give myself a fertility massage. I stretch regularly and do some yoga poses for fertility. Then during the work day I try not to get stressed and I get up and walk around the office every hour. I've also tried to sit in chairs less. 
I'm keeping my uterus warm with heating pads, hot water bottle, hot hands, etc. Eating mostly warm foods, drinking lots of herbal tea, no caffeine but I've had 2 glasses of red wine during this cycle. Every night I soak my feet in hot water with a few drops of essential oils my acupuncturist gave me for detox called White Flower for 15 minutes, then give myself reflexology. Finally I listen to my meditation and fall asleep by 11. 
My protocol this time has been really low key. Started with 1 Estrogen pill (2mg)/day, up to 2 on day 5 and up to 3 on day 9. I did one viagra suppository on day 5 because I had it and was afraid my doctor only had 2 speeds, 0 or 100 (based on my last 2 cycles). 
Anyway, I am incredibly thrilled that I got above a 6, much less reaching the goal of a 7! Now I finally get to move forward and complete the cycle. Transfer day is 6/5. Please send positive baby vibes! :)

I started taking herbs from my most recent acupuncturist about 3 weeks ago (for liver, kidney, and blood support). 
I really went all out this time. I bought a frozen embryo transfer meditation from Circle&amp;Bloom that I started on day1. Each morning I read a list of affirmations while I give myself a fertility massage. I stretch regularly and do some yoga poses for fertility. Then during the work day I try not to get stressed and I get up and walk around the office every hour. I&#39;ve also tried to sit in chairs less. 
I&#39;m keeping my uterus warm with heating pads, hot water bottle, hot hands, etc. Eating mostly warm foods, drinking lots of herbal tea, no caffeine but I&#39;ve had 2 glasses of red wine during this cycle. Every night I soak my feet in hot water with a few drops of essential oils my acupuncturist gave me for detox called White Flower for 15 minutes, then give myself reflexology. Finally I listen to my meditation and fall asleep by 11. 
My protocol this time has been really low key. Started with 1 Estrogen pill (2mg)/day, up to 2 on day 5 and up to 3 on day 9. I did one viagra suppository on day 5 because I had it and was afraid my doctor only had 2 speeds, 0 or 100 (based on my last 2 cycles). 
Anyway, I am incredibly thrilled that I got above a 6, much less reaching the goal of a 7! Now I finally get to move forward and complete the cycle. Transfer day is 6/5. Please send positive baby vibes! :)
Thank you for those who commented and offered advice before. I don&#39;t think I would have gotten to this point without it!</p>

216,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I know there's been some increased interest in overseas IVF/DE treatments, so I thought I'd share some of my info about cycling in the Czech Republic.

IVF and DE are both very cheap in the Czech Republic. Everything is cheap in the Czech Republic, honestly, and it's a wonderful country with beautiful towns and cities to visit and friendly people. It depends on the clinic, of course, but OE IVF will be somewhere around $2000 (plus meds). A donor egg cycle will be around $5000. PGS depends, but is around $350 per embryo. Most clinics offer a guarantee that's something of 2 high-quality embryos at day 3 or 5, many include an additional guarantee of a discounted or free cycle if the first 2 don't work.

They don't have an official organization like SART to report to, and because many of their clients are overseas and therefore aren't around for continuing care to report things like ongoing pregnancies. Clinics will give success rates on their websites, but those aren't always complete information - for better or for worse.

You can do either own egg or donor egg in the Czech Republic. The three most popular clinics are Gennet (Prague), Reprofit (Brno), and Zlin (Zlin). There are multiple others, those are just the most popular at the moment.

Own egg is more popular for women in Europe (mostly UK) because the flights and travel time are much easier. Zlin, for instance, last I heard - requires that you be there for the entire cycle time - so 3 weeks. Otherwise you'd need to plan to be there for about 10 days, depending on what kind of transfer you want.

If you're going just for a transfer, you could technically do it in as little as 4 days from the US: 2 days to get there, one day for transfer, one day to get back - but that would be pretty hectic and require everything to go perfectly with your lining and cycle.

Donor egg is very popular. Brno and Zlin are both university towns, so there's a large population of young donors. Reprofit also has double donor embryos - not donated, but created and available on-hand ($1100 per embryo untested, $1500 per embryo tested). If you're using your partner's sperm, I'd recommend scheduling it so you can leave at least one frozen sample in case you have to do another cycle. 

Donors are stimmed gently there - they'll usually end up with about 8 eggs, and between 2-4 embryos. I'd say 2 is more common.

You can order meds overseas. There is a chance they'll get hung up in customs, but that has not happened to me. UK pharmacies will fill off a Czech prescription, US pharmacies won't. I bought a lot of extra meds when I was over there for a transfer and that has been helpful when I required more than one cycle.

It's easiest if you have a doctor here who's on board. Most RE clinics will do ""outside monitoring"" - that is, they'll do your ultrasounds and blood tests and send over the reports, but they won't prescribe meds. You can order a lot of your own blood tests through a service like walkinlab.com. That is all out of pocket. I found my OB/GYN has been more helpful than my RE.

Czech law does not allow transfers for same-sex couples or single women, but you can have anyone be your ""partner."" They just need to have forms signed and notarized here and bring a copy of their passport - they don't have to come.

Czech law also does not allow for gender selection. Transfers can be done up until a woman's 49th or 50th birthday (there is some conflict about this, so ask your clinic). 

All donors are anonymous. You get age, height, weight, hair and eye color, and blood type. Some clinics will also give you details about course of study for students and hobbies or interests. Many clinics the doctors will choose for you, based on your stated preferences. Other places you might be offered a choice.

Clinics are clean and modern. I went to CCRM before we cycled in CZ, and I find them perfectly equivalent.

Travel is long, but not too complicated. Many people in the Czech Republic speak good English. You'll have to take a connecting flight from the US (I think Delta might do a seasonal direct flight to Prague from NYC). For Prague, you can fly into the city. There is a small airport in Brno, but it's very easy for Brno and Zlin to fly into either Prague or Vienna and take a bus or train there. (StudentAgency.eu is a cheap and excellent bus service that leaves from baggage claim at the Vienna Airport and just across the parking lot at the Prague airport.) 

The tricky part of travel is knowing far enough in advance when you're going to book a good flight, so your cycle will probably be manipulated to let you plan ahead. We've found it easiest to book frequent flyer tickets (if you don't have miles, watch for sales for your preferred airline where you can buy them - sometimes that's a good value, mostly if you're flying business or first class) because the change fees are much less. You can also follow travel blogs like The Points Guy who will let you know about airfare sales.

People often use the cycle as a chance to travel, either while the embryos are cooking, or before or after transfer. Most popular places for a nearby getaway are Prague, Budapest, Vienna, and Czesky Krumlov.

There are a few coordinators who will help (for an additional fee). I have used Sue at IVF Traveler. There's also MyIVFAlternative.

The language barrier does exist, but it's relatively minor - their English is quite good. I find it easier to communicate in writing, as it removes the accent, but they will Skype with you for consultations and WTF appointments. 

They are best at straightforward cases. If you have complicated what-if questions, it's helpful to have a doctor here and/or a coordinator, and to be willing to assemble things yourself. They will write orders for tests and ultrasounds and doctors here will usually accept those.

We haven't had success yet, but that is due to us and not to the clinics. I've been reading message boards (fertilityfriends.co.uk has the most active Czech communities) for almost two years and have seen lots of people have success.

<p>If you&#39;re going just for a transfer, you could technically do it in as little as 4 days from the US: 2 days to get there, one day for transfer, one day to get back - but that would be pretty hectic and require everything to go perfectly with your lining and cycle.</p>

<p>Donor egg is very popular. Brno and Zlin are both university towns, so there&#39;s a large population of young donors. Reprofit also has double donor embryos - not donated, but created and available on-hand ($1100 per embryo untested, $1500 per embryo tested). If you&#39;re using your partner&#39;s sperm, I&#39;d recommend scheduling it so you can leave at least one frozen sample in case you have to do another cycle. </p>

<p>Donors are stimmed gently there - they&#39;ll usually end up with about 8 eggs, and between 2-4 embryos. I&#39;d say 2 is more common.</p>

<p>You can order meds overseas. There is a chance they&#39;ll get hung up in customs, but that has not happened to me. UK pharmacies will fill off a Czech prescription, US pharmacies won&#39;t. I bought a lot of extra meds when I was over there for a transfer and that has been helpful when I required more than one cycle.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easiest if you have a doctor here who&#39;s on board. Most RE clinics will do &quot;outside monitoring&quot; - that is, they&#39;ll do your ultrasounds and blood tests and send over the reports, but they won&#39;t prescribe meds. You can order a lot of your own blood tests through a service like walkinlab.com. That is all out of pocket. I found my OB/GYN has been more helpful than my RE.</p>

<p>Czech law does not allow transfers for same-sex couples or single women, but you can have anyone be your &quot;partner.&quot; They just need to have forms signed and notarized here and bring a copy of their passport - they don&#39;t have to come.</p>

<p>Czech law also does not allow for gender selection. Transfers can be done up until a woman&#39;s 49th or 50th birthday (there is some conflict about this, so ask your clinic). </p>

<p>All donors are anonymous. You get age, height, weight, hair and eye color, and blood type. Some clinics will also give you details about course of study for students and hobbies or interests. Many clinics the doctors will choose for you, based on your stated preferences. Other places you might be offered a choice.</p>

<p>Clinics are clean and modern. I went to CCRM before we cycled in CZ, and I find them perfectly equivalent.</p>

<p>Travel is long, but not too complicated. Many people in the Czech Republic speak good English. You&#39;ll have to take a connecting flight from the US (I think Delta might do a seasonal direct flight to Prague from NYC). For Prague, you can fly into the city. There is a small airport in Brno, but it&#39;s very easy for Brno and Zlin to fly into either Prague or Vienna and take a bus or train there. (StudentAgency.eu is a cheap and excellent bus service that leaves from baggage claim at the Vienna Airport and just across the parking lot at the Prague airport.) </p>

<p>The tricky part of travel is knowing far enough in advance when you&#39;re going to book a good flight, so your cycle will probably be manipulated to let you plan ahead. We&#39;ve found it easiest to book frequent flyer tickets (if you don&#39;t have miles, watch for sales for your preferred airline where you can buy them - sometimes that&#39;s a good value, mostly if you&#39;re flying business or first class) because the change fees are much less. You can also follow travel blogs like The Points Guy who will let you know about airfare sales.</p>

<p>People often use the cycle as a chance to travel, either while the embryos are cooking, or before or after transfer. Most popular places for a nearby getaway are Prague, Budapest, Vienna, and Czesky Krumlov.</p>

<p>There are a few coordinators who will help (for an additional fee). I have used Sue at IVF Traveler. There&#39;s also MyIVFAlternative.</p>

<p>The language barrier does exist, but it&#39;s relatively minor - their English is quite good. I find it easier to communicate in writing, as it removes the accent, but they will Skype with you for consultations and WTF appointments. </p>

<p>They are best at straightforward cases. If you have complicated what-if questions, it&#39;s helpful to have a doctor here and/or a coordinator, and to be willing to assemble things yourself. They will write orders for tests and ultrasounds and doctors here will usually accept those.</p>

<p>We haven&#39;t had success yet, but that is due to us and not to the clinics. I&#39;ve been reading message boards (fertilityfriends.co.uk has the most active Czech communities) for almost two years and have seen lots of people have success.</p>

<p>Happy to answer any questions or add to this if I&#39;ve left anything major out.</p>

So a little back story first: my mom got remarried back in 2014. She hadn't dated this guy all that long and I lived on the other side of the country at the time (and a few states away now). Both halves of this marriage have grown children, I've met a couple of his ""kids"" at the wedding and briefly a couple of other times.

A couple of weeks ago, I spotted. Just once. And it came with twisting back pain. Those two things could mean most anything - that I'm 39 and in perimenopause, for instance, or that I slept wrong, or that I was working too hard at Christmas. Whatever. But I noticed the signs. I marked them down, to myself.

Christmas came and went, and I thought about it. I thought - I bet this is it. I posed for pictures with my family, thinking about one day saying to someone, see? You were there. We just didn't know it yet.

We went to Las Vegas. On the plane a baby sat in front of me, arms waving like a little anemone, and hours later, after we arrived at the house and I was going through my shoulder bag looking for tip money, I pulled out a pink rubber pacifier. Surprised, I laughed aloud. The baby had dropped it, and I'd carried it away. In the same moment that I knew it was just a coincidence, I also decided it was a sign. I resolved to keep it, if my suspicions were right. To wash it off. See? I imagined explaining to someone, later. Pointing to it in the bourgeois display cabinet where we keep silly things and curiosities. Know where I got that? Fate, that's where.

I decided to drink as much as I usually would on this vacation, because after all, I didn't officially know anything yet. And this would probably be my last chance. For how long. A year? Basically. Long enough, anyway. I smiled and cheersed with rum, and we took a picture around the table on New Year's Eve, all of dressed in our best and smiling big. My breasts look unusually lush in that picture. See? I imagined saying to someone, later. You can tell.

We went to Vegas instead of the tropics because one of us was planning to be pregnant then, and she was afraid of Zika. She wound up getting divorced instead. Wouldn't that be ironic, I thought to myself. I composed the email to her, in my mind. You're not going to believe this, but.... And then a picture of the stick.

So when my period due date came and went, I wasn't surprised. Nervous, maybe. Wow, I thought, was I right? The signs are all there. I felt different. Moods different. Soreness different. Absent, in fact. Waiting.

Another day came and went. We flew home. I wore a tight new sweater dress, and poked at my soft belly when in the airplane bathroom, sinking my finger into my flesh, through the fat to the gentle give of muscles underneath. What's in there? I wondered to myself. I tallied months up on my fingers. Arrival at the end of September, give or take. 

That night, I fell asleep. I dreamt. I dreamt about peeing on the stick, and watching it, and the stick said ""yes"" (verbatim, which is not what they say, but that's what it said in the dream). I was happy. I was excited. Is this really it? I wondered to myself. Can this be real? But it wasn't real, because I was dreaming. I woke up, unsure. Still dark, but getting light. The stick was a dream. But I had one in the medicine cabinet. Should I take it?

I didn't want to. I knew it had all been a dream. If it's true, I reasoned, it will be true if I use the stick or not. Same as if it's not true. I went back to bed.

I woke up in deep, gnawing pain. All day, all last night, keeping me awake, and all today.

Sorry for the long explanation to follow:

Got pregnant in 2015 after trying for about six months. Was tracking and everything looked good, my cycles have always been very regular, my luteal phase was a bit short but not too bad. Anyway, got pregnant, almost never stopped bleeding and cramping through the pregnancy, but we had a heartbeat and no signs of anything wrong, until I miscarried very abruptly at 11w4d after a particularly bleedy week at the end of 2015.

Started trying again a couple months later, trying to keep it casual to avoid it being too gutwrenching after what we went through, so I didn't track for the first few months, just guessed based on prior data. No successes, so I started tracking again and noticed I wasn't getting reliable temp spikes anymore. My cycle was still as regular and consistent as it gets, though. Talked to doctor in Sept, he did the CD21 progesterone test and it was 8.6(ng/mL), did it again in October and it was 5.7(ng/mL). Started clomid 50mg, that was 8.0(ng/mL). Got on 100mg, and finally got a 11.2(ng/mL) on Friday.

So, all this to ask, how can they tell the difference between a low progesterone issue and an ovulating issue? I feel confused about the fact that you can set your watch to my cycles, but I'm not ovulating according to progesterone tests... but low progesterone is also a very common cause of miscarriages, isn't it? Is it possible that I am ovulating, but not making enough progesterone to hold onto any potential pregnancies? I always suspected it was the cause of my MC last year based on the fact that I bled so much, though I have no idea if that's actually true or just an idea I got in my head, I'm working on getting the labs from the clinic I was seeing during my pregnancy.

I hope this makes sense. I probably have a huge misunderstanding about the mechanism of progesterone and fertility, and that's what I'm seeking to understand so that I can stop feeling like we're not doing everything possible. Any insight is appreciated <3

Talked to doctor in Sept, he did the CD21 progesterone test and it was 8.6(ng/mL), did it again in October and it was 5.7(ng/mL). Started clomid 50mg, that was 8.0(ng/mL). Got on 100mg, and finally got a 11.2(ng/mL) on Friday.</p>

<p>So, all this to ask, how can they tell the difference between a low progesterone issue and an ovulating issue? I feel confused about the fact that you can set your watch to my cycles, but I&#39;m not ovulating according to progesterone tests... but low progesterone is also a very common cause of miscarriages, isn&#39;t it? Is it possible that I am ovulating, but not making enough progesterone to hold onto any potential pregnancies? I always suspected it was the cause of my MC last year based on the fact that I bled so much, though I have no idea if that&#39;s actually true or just an idea I got in my head, I&#39;m working on getting the labs from the clinic I was seeing during my pregnancy.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. I probably have a huge misunderstanding about the mechanism of progesterone and fertility, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeking to understand so that I can stop feeling like we&#39;re not doing everything possible. Any insight is appreciated &lt;3</p>

<p>EDIT: removed some unnecessary stuff that&#39;s better for the results thread.</p>

239,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello everyone. I've been lurking but this is my first post. I turn 36 today and got my period this morning. Feeling pretty discouraged. 

I've told a few close friends and family members about what we're going through, but I've found it hard to build a real support network and am feeling a bit ungrounded. Even some of my best friends seem sort of at a loss for what to say or how to support. I'm not sure what to tell them, and I don't blame them, but I feel pretty alone. 

We've been actively trying for just over a year, monitoring temps and CM and CP and OPKs, acupuncture, supplements, mayan massage, etc - but I've wanted and waited for this for many years before so I guess it feels like longer. I was with the same partner all through my 20s and a few months after he told me he was finally ready for a baby he left me. I was devastated, and although I'm in a much healthier, happier relationship now and grateful for it, that experience still introduced pain into this space for me, and it was a delicate space to enter again with my current partner and it took many years to get here. 

So here we are, much later in life than I'd hoped to be trying for my first, but still I'm thankful to have gotten to this place with my wonderful partner and to be finally financially stable enough and have good enough insurance to get some help. 

I've had basic blood testing and everything seems okay except my progesterone, which is low but still indicates ovulation (7.1 at 7DPO). My luteal phase is marginal (10-11 days), but not short enough to concern my doctor. Well, both of those things concern me, but not my doctor. SA results were good. 

What is weird is that I tracked my period (without temping) for 2 years before we started trying to conceive, and every cycle was 29 or 30 days. Since we started trying, my cycles have been from 33-38 days. Literally from the first time we tried. Paired with my low progesterone, I'm wondering if I'm having super early miscarriages every month. Again, my doctor is just like, those cycles are a little long but fine. I've never gotten a positive pregnancy test, but I only recently learned that very faint lines count, so I very well could be having regular chemicals. I don't know for sure, but I don't have another explanation. 

My doctor has offered Clomid and IUI, but it feels like a pretty generic stab in the dark. I'll probably try at least the Clomid for a few cycles and see where it goes. We'll never be able to afford IVF, but I do have coverage for IUI - though I'm not sure if there's any point in that since my partner's SA was good. 

When we started trying to get pregnant I stopped taking meds for anxiety and depression, so that may be a variable as well. I think I've been handling it okay, but the meds did have a huge positive impact on my quality of life, so it has been a struggle adjusting to not having them. My doctor thinks I should start them again, but I don't know. Maybe depends on how far the path of interventions we get - I also have some past sexual trauma that makes me anxious about IUI, etc - so far I've turned down an HSG and they've been okay with that since I don't have any risk factors. I did used to have an IUD that -in addition to a very painful insertion experience- gave me terrible cramps for 6 months until I took it out. Otherwise I've not used hormonal birth control in probably 10 years. 

Anyway, that's my long rambling introduction. Any advice or words of encouragement welcomed.

**One** At PT, I joked with my therapist about how he fell asleep before Midnight on NYE...and how it was his last one to party before having a baby. (Both my PT and his assistant have pregnant wives...that's been ""fun"" but I'm dealing with it). And another lady in there, who barely knows them and didn't know that, started joking about how ""it's ok, next year he'll be up cause he'll never get good sleep again."" And then went ON AND ON about how ""having a child is a life sentence of no sleep""...kept saying things like ""Even when they grow up! Shoot I worry more now cause I can't control them at all.""

SHUT UP LADY. Your jokes are bad and you should feel bad. 

I despise when people, even jokingly, talk about parenting like it sucks. Yeah, I imagine it is hard. I imagine you do miss some sleep sometimes. But I know plenty of parents who get plenty of sleep. And I would kill/give a body part/etc to have that problem. I'd love to not have to IMAGINE it. So argh.

**Two** My bowling league organizer sent an email reminder about January signups/start date/etc. A lengthy email full of necessary info. In reply (there was no need for ANYONE to reply ALL) someone sent a picture *of their newborn* with jokes about how the baby is ready to be a sub if anyone needs one. AHHHH.  Like, this was a 2 week old baby (how do I know? Oh, yeah...cause they sent a fucking announcement to the bowling league list 2 weeks ago....like we care?).

First of all, don't reply all. There are ~100 people in our bowling league -- maybe you personally know 15 of them??  The other 75 of us don't care one tiny bit about your baby. And its 1000% off topic so it wasn't needed. I hate people who don't know how to ""reply all"" correctly and those who go off topic and start tangent threads inside useful, important ones. But I especially hate it when I open a BOWLING email and have a newborn picture in my face!!

**Three** A doctor at the orthopedics place saw me checking out. He's super friendly and great and we usually chat. He asked how I was doing and I kind of blandly said ""Ok and how are you?""  He goes ""Only ok? Whats wrong? Is your knee not doing well?""  And I told him my knee was fine. He then asked me why I was melancholy. I kinda brushed it off but he said again ""No no, you can tell me...I don't like seeing you like this!""........so I told him ""I just had my 5th pregnancy loss and I'm just not feeling well emotionally."".  ARGH - I didn't *care* to bring it up right then. 

AND THEN his response was sweet but still annoying. So it turned into a whole thing. Sigh. He went on and on about how he ""understands"" and then told me he only has one child and she's the product of IVF so he's ""been there"". I asked him if the had any losses and he said no...so really I'm not sure how that compares to my current pain. And then he told me that their infertility was due to his wife being a cancer survivor and that they'll ""probably figure mine out if we keep looking."" Well...no, I doubt it. Seeing as how I've had basically every test in the book. So the whole convo was just annoying. =/

<p><strong>One</strong> At PT, I joked with my therapist about how he fell asleep before Midnight on NYE...and how it was his last one to party before having a baby. (Both my PT and his assistant have pregnant wives...that&#39;s been &quot;fun&quot; but I&#39;m dealing with it). And another lady in there, who barely knows them and didn&#39;t know that, started joking about how &quot;it&#39;s ok, next year he&#39;ll be up cause he&#39;ll never get good sleep again.&quot; And then went ON AND ON about how &quot;having a child is a life sentence of no sleep&quot;...kept saying things like &quot;Even when they grow up! Shoot I worry more now cause I can&#39;t control them at all.&quot;</p>

<p>SHUT UP LADY. Your jokes are bad and you should feel bad. </p>

<p>I despise when people, even jokingly, talk about parenting like it sucks. Yeah, I imagine it is hard. I imagine you do miss some sleep sometimes. But I know plenty of parents who get plenty of sleep. And I would kill/give a body part/etc to have that problem. I&#39;d love to not have to IMAGINE it. So argh.</p>

<p><strong>Two</strong> My bowling league organizer sent an email reminder about January signups/start date/etc. A lengthy email full of necessary info. In reply (there was no need for ANYONE to reply ALL) someone sent a picture <em>of their newborn</em> with jokes about how the baby is ready to be a sub if anyone needs one. AHHHH.  Like, this was a 2 week old baby (how do I know? Oh, yeah...cause they sent a fucking announcement to the bowling league list 2 weeks ago....like we care?).</p>

<p>First of all, don&#39;t reply all. There are ~100 people in our bowling league -- maybe you personally know 15 of them??  The other 75 of us don&#39;t care one tiny bit about your baby. And its 1000% off topic so it wasn&#39;t needed. I hate people who don&#39;t know how to &quot;reply all&quot; correctly and those who go off topic and start tangent threads inside useful, important ones. But I especially hate it when I open a BOWLING email and have a newborn picture in my face!!</p>

He asked how I was doing and I kind of blandly said &quot;Ok and how are you?&quot;  He goes &quot;Only ok? Whats wrong? Is your knee not doing well?&quot;  And I told him my knee was fine.

I've been pondering this since I went to get a PAP from an RN and she was rude. Insinuating that my Dr's were either unethical and overstimulated me, or I was unethical by having (potentially) extra embryos after we complete our family (still trying for our first BTW). Why are women such bitches to each other?

Now I know it's not JUST women who suck when it comes to IF- but I'm thinking even more globally. Women are damned if we do and damned if we don't on everything- especially anything to do with birthing or rearing children. 

As all my fiends have lapped me more than once on the making of tiny humans, my Facebook newsfeed has been ""woah is the mommy wars"" for awhile now. But today a women posted a link in my Resolve community to a blogger complaining about how hard secondary infertility is because you aren't infertile enough for the infertile crowd. It made me so angry that this women felt she didn't fit in with other mothers (because she used a GC) or infertiles (because she had been successful) and she had to suffer through it alone.

But then I realized my own dr had just done a similar thing to me at our FET baseline appointment. She was trying to give me the odds of this transfer working, but in doing so she also minimized my infertility. It went like this:

""Well since you're not doing IVF because of an infertility diagnosis, and JUST tubal issues, your chances are probably even higher!""

But if I don't have tubes, am I not infertile? I mean I get what she meant. No egg quality or sperm issues, but still. It stings to feel like you haven't suffered enough to belong, but suffered more than enough so you cannot be blissfully ignorant either.

I know it's hard to find the right things to say sometimes when we are dealing with this shit, AND we are hopped up on hormones and may be more affected by offhanded remarks, but I still hate this women on women hate in today's society.

This place has been so supportive and truly feels like the best of humanity in the worst situation. I just wish the rest of the world could be more like this sub.</p>

I'm 36 and my husband (38, good junk) and I have been officially trying for about 18 months - we literally got pregnant on our first try in March 2015 (really not even trying, just not preventing) and then I miscarried at 6.5 weeks, after telling our parents and his siblings (jesus, so naive). Have not been able to get pregnant since. Started seeing an RE about a year ago, diagnosed w/DOR, AMH 0.16, but day 3 FSH all over the map - as low as 5.6 and high as 20.2. Probably also some luteal phase defect - I was already freaking out before we started trying because my cycles were super short without supplemental progesterone.

Insurance doesn't cover injectables, IUI, or IVF, but I've gotten some injectables here and there either donated (gonal-f) or paid out of pocket (ovidrel), plus letrozole, metformin, and oral progesterone. Plus so many stupid supplements - I'm starting to get angry every time I take another goddamned prenatal multi. Lots of bloodwork and ultrasounds and phone calls telling us when to have sex, followed up by phone calls telling me I'm not pregnant. We're trying to quickly pay down some existing debt & explore options for insurance (my employer is actually considering adding coverage!) before deciding on next steps. We've actually been taking a break for a few months in an attempt to avoid holiday meltdowns. Failed on that - of course I get my period on Thanksgiving weekend. And Christmas weekend. 

Now I've been bleeding for 12 days straight since my period. Days 5 through 12 have ranged from spotting up to a light-day period level. I'm having intermittent sharp pain on my right side - not severe, more distressing mentally than physically. Went to the ER on Friday night convinced I had appendicitis but they ruled that out along with pregnancy (duh) and told me I had a bladder infection (yay) and to follow up with my doctor about the bleeding (everyone's off today). 

So I'm thinking, maybe a ruptured cyst? But my (seriously amazing) acupuncturist, who responds to emails, says it doesn't sound like a cyst, I shouldn't be bleeding this much, and to get it checked out ASAP. Which will have to be tomorrow or Wednesday unless the pain or bleeding get bad enough to go back to the ER. Ugh.

Any ideas or general commiserating welcome.

*Edited to add:

UPDATE: I decided to just go to my RE's office this morning since they start seeing patients at 6:30 but don't answer the phone until 9. They did bloodwork and ultrasound and found a 44mm cyst on my right side, a smaller one on the left. So that explains the abdominal discomfort. Bloodwork confirmed I'm not pregnant, so no ectopic. Bleeding still seems somewhat unexplained but they told me to stop taking any meds and come back in a week.

Now grappling with the decision to move forward immediately or take a cycle off or what. In the freezer, I have 4 embryos frozen at day 6 (4AA, 4AB, two 4BBs). Didn't do PGS.

If I move forward I'd start birth control pills right away for some period of time, then if baseline looks good, do estrace 3x/day, then progesterone, then transfer. 

Any insight? Benefits or downsides to starting right away (anecdotal or empirical)? Any questions I should be sure to ask (other than would I do 1 or 2 embryos)? Is it good, bad, neutral that I had a CP in terms of future FET success? I know that the possibilities are literally all over the place.

Last September we got the full workup done. I checked out OK, but husband had a 1% morphology on his SA. All other parameters were average. The doctor suggested a test wash---if the results were OK, she recommended IUI. If the wash outcome was poor, she recommended straight to IVF.

Husband and I decided to instead make some lifestyle changes --- cut back on alcohol, switched from briefs to boxers, and he started taking vitamins. Three months later we repeated the SA, and his total count and motility and total motile sperm increased (""excellent"" was the RE's word), but morphology only went from 1% to 2%. 

Now we sit here with choice paralysis. Do we try naturally for a while with the new numbers? Try IUI (the test wash had ""good"" results, per the RE), or just still go straight to IVF? The cost is a huge factor and we have 0 insurance coverage. We are still ""young"" at 31 years old.

I'm wondering if anyone else had improvement of their MFI and if so, what they decided to do moving forward. Or any thoughts about the IUI or IVF numbers game. Part of us wants to jump right to IVF, but we aren't sure how to play the odds and maximize our dollars spent. Some people say they wish they had gone straight to IVF in the beginning, others say IUI can work and is valuable. (For a cost frame of reference, we were quoted about $1800 per medicated IUI vs $20k flat for the 6 cycle or money-back IVF guarantee at our clinic.) 

I am also getting completely overwhelmed by the appointment schedule. I am a nurse, and I do not have a flexible job or the ability to take any time off of days I'm working for an appointment. (If I am scheduled to work, I can't just leave for an hour to have an ultrasound, e.g.) Any nurses out there, or people who also have extremely inflexible jobs or work schedules, have recommendations or tips on how to schedule? I'd rather not involve my boss, but my schedule is set for the next 2 months, and looking at the calendar caused a major meltdown. How can you even guess when you will need these appointments, and how many of them? Obviously, it's worth it for a shot at a baby, but do you put your lives/plans on hold for a bit when you start cycles? Is it more flexible than it seems and I'm overreacting?

Thanks for reading our story and for any advice. I figured I would stop asking these questions of myself and pose them here.

I've been poking around this sub for a while and I hope you don't mind me asking for your advice.

.

I know I'm very new here - I'm 31, have been trying unsuccessfully for 10 cycles. I ovulate every cycle (confirmed by temping,OPKs and a day 21 progesterone). My cycles range from 26 days to 34 days. I ovulate around day 16 although CD1 can be hard to pinpoint because every cycle I spot up until my period.
I start spotting between 4-6DPO and keep spotting until my full flow. The spotting gets worse - sometimes with red blood and clots, then usually gets light again for a day, then my period starts.

.

My GP was concerned enough to send me to a fertility specialist. My ultrasound and all my day 3 hormone tests (inc AMH) were within range (as are my hubbys SAs). So I currently have no answers. The fertility specialist put me on the waitlist for a hysteroscopy and laparoscopy which should take about 4 months (they are funded here). In the meantime I am just driving myself crazy. I asked the Dr about potential treatment if they don't find anything but she seemed unwilling to talk about it until we had the surgery results... fertility treatment would not be funded so it is all out of pocket for us.

.

Is there anyone here who has had a similar situation? What are the treatment options in this case? Can medication help even if my hormone levels are normal? Is it worth experimenting with Vitex, supplements etc in the meantime? (I currently only take B6). I am feeling desperate.

.

I'm sorry if these questions seem premature and/or stupid. I am just so sick of hanging out on the TTC board where people call it baby dancing and announce their pregnancies every 2 minutes. In my house it's now, *oh fuck, we have to have SEX again* and I don't even get to test because I'm bleeding most of my luteal phase (I have just started a new Reddit account to move on from all of that shit. New Year and all that!)

.

Now that I have officially renamed my baby saving bank account to 'fertility treatment savings' I feel like I belong here, rather than there. In saying that I know it hasn't been a long time (although it has felt that way!) and I really don't want to offend anyone here. You ladies are amazing and I am in awe of your resilience, perseverance and strength in what is the worst fucking situation ever!

.

Wishing you all the best for 2017,
TIA xx

I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while and wanted to introduce myself after I hopped into the chat the other evening and had a really nice time talking with some of the wonderful women in this thread. Hello to the men in here too, there just weren't any in the chat. 
I'm 38 (close to 39), husband is 42 and we started trying to get pregnant just over 2 years ago.  I became pregnant after only a few months of trying.  At 24 weeks (Aug/2015), I lost my mucus plug, spent 3 days in the hospital on bedrest and gave birth to my daughter via emergency c-section at 24 weeks and 3 days because of cervical incompetence.  After a 2 week stay in the NICU that came with extensive medical challenges, we decided to withdraw care and said goodbye to our baby girl.  
We decided to start trying again about 6 months later (Feb 2016) and had a chemical in July.  Since then we've been to an RE, have done two cycles of IUI with Femara with no luck getting pregnant.  After this last cycle, we decided to be aggressive with next steps and move to IVF.  
I am currently on birth control.  At the last follicle check on Thursday, I have a cyst which means birth control for longer before I start stimming.  If the cyst goes away, the plan is to start stimming meds around 1/14.  This will be determined at our next appt in about a week.  
We decided to go the PGS route to limit the possibility of transfer of an abnormal embryo but I'm not quite ready to think about what's going to come next. Have to get through all the other stuff first... one step at a time.

I wanted to reach out and see if anyone had experience/opinions or information from their doctors on trying to conceive after ectopic.  I lost my left tube last week.  I did not take methotrexate so as far as I know there is no waiting period beyond healing.   My question/solicitation for feedback comes from my RE telling me it would be highly likely I will have another ectopic if I conceive.  I don't know if he's just the ""doesn't sugar coat it type"" or being overly cautious or not...or if something about my personal situation warrants more caution.   He told me he now considers me a ""tubal disorder"" patient as well as an ovulation disorder patient.  


I had a cyst removed from my right (remaining) tube in September and during that surgery he found no endo, abnormalities, etc - both tubes were dye tested and open.  Even with the cyst the right tube was flowing dye.  He did find scarring in my abdomen...he told me it was not near my pelvis but he said sometimes that extensive of scarring could have been causing some issues.  The scarring was unexplained but possibly related to a hernia surgery I had as a toddler.   So he tells me that my right tube might have some issue and it has also been operated on so I'm at ""very high risk"" for another ectopic.  At first he said it would not be wise to continue trying.  Then he told me later that day that he would take care of me whatever we decide and if we conceive again.  Oh and I should also mention after removing the tube, he found two small spots of endo behind it.  Did this cause the ectopic?  Do I have more widespread endo that was not seen before? 




  I don't feel done trying to conceive but we are done with treatments. We can't afford ivf and I'm not sure that is the right choice for us anyway.  We did not want to pursue other IUI or ovulation induction either.  So this would really be trying on our own.  Thoughts?  Is it really risky?
