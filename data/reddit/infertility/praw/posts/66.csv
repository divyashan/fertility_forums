Ive made a few posts here about our infertility treatments. I was reccently able to participate in a study at a local clinic using PRP  (platelet rich plasma) injected directly into my ovaries in the hopes that it would improve an IVF stimulation cycle. The study is in phase 1 and this means there is no control group; the people in this study all receieve injections (no placebos). Phase 1 is meant to establish a control group. We had injections in July and we went in for baseline testing on cycle day 2 for 4 total months. Here are the results: 

JULY 11TH CYCLE LENGTH 27 DAYS
BASE LINE CYCLE
E2: 68
LH: 6
FSH: 11
AMH: >0.03
AFC: 6

AUG 7TH CYCLE LENGTH 23 DAYS
CYCLE 1 POST INJECTIONS
FSH: 8.68
LH: 3.21
E2: 54.8
AFC: 12
AMH: 0.89

AUG 29TH CYCLE LENGTH 25 DAYS
CYCLE 2 POST INJECTIONS
FSH: 7.73
LH: 2.62
EST: 45.7
AMH: 0.86
AFC: 10-15

SEP 24th - NO CYCLE LENGTH, ON BIRTH CONTROL
FSH: 10.2
LH: 2.56
EST: 39
AMH: 0.62
AFC: 10-15

Then I had an IVF cycle during my September 24th cycle. I was on birth control until the following week (8 days total) and I got a period on october 6th (how fun). With the start of flow (day 1) I started stimulation. 600 iu follistim, 8iu saizen hgh (or .8ml), 10 units of low dose hcg (insulin needle). My meds stayed the same through my first scan and changed slightly. On stim day 4 (also conveniently cycle day 4) i got instructions to do the same for day 5 but low dose hcg should be 15 now, and then the following night, day 6, should  be 40 units of low dose hcg, 75iu of follistim, and the saizen. I missed this part about dropping the follistim and gave myself the usual (600). I discovered this the next day and told the doctor. He did not feel the need to adjust the meds again so they stayed the same, and I did only 75iu that day. We triggered on stim day 11, and went in on day 13 for collection and got 6 eggs. 5 were mature. 3 fertilized normally. All 3 were left alone in culture for 5 days and not checked, and on day 5 we got the call they would wait for day 6. Day 6 came abd the doctor called saying all had arrested. 5 cell, 9 cell, 8 cell. 

We discussed the PRP clearly did not make a difference for me. There was no reason why though, i am sure he will write about it after he has complete data. I do think its clear that there was an immediate difference for me in my numbers, but they were clearly temporary and did not affect the production of my follicles nor my egg quality. As a result, since the study is about improving antral follicle count the answer appears to be likely: no, it cannot. However, it may improve ovarian function, at least temporarily. 

At this point my husband and I are pursuing donor embryos. We have chosen our donors  (we are doing anonymous) and we are actually lined up for transfer before Christmas. We are over the moon excited.

I've just finishes my 2nd round of Clomid - it was prescribed by my OB/GYN since I’m 38 and we just hit our 11th unsuccessful cycle. 

Last cycle, I did have 1 mature follicle on 50mg, so my doc kept me at 50mg for the 2nd round.  This time I have a super high response. 

On CD13, my u/s showed I had 5 really well sized follicles (20x20x20, 21x21x24, 19x19x19 and 2 other similarly sized ones).  The doc told me about the risk of multiples and left it up to us.  We decided to give it a go. 

I have also been doing OPK tests since CD12, and I haven't had a + OPK yet since the u/s.

My question is -- do you think I ovulated already, but just missed it on my OPKs?  The doc was pretty confident that I would ovulate within 24 hours. 

Is it common to have mature follicles, but no ovulation to occur?  Is there anything I can request from the doctor to confirm I actually ovulated?

Ultrasound yesterday, with my doctor: normal.

Ultrasound this morning, with another doctor: detected what the doctor said looked like a small fibroid against the wall of the cavity.
 
Ultrasound this afternoon, with my doctor: She believed it wasn't a fibroid, but said it was probably some retained tissue we hadn't caught before. Apparently one side of the lining is thicker than the other side. I asked why it didn't show up on the saline sono or the previous ultrasounds. She said ""I don't know, but it's here now."" She also said she'd looked back at the images from the saline sono before our appointment and that they still looked clear to her.

So now my transfer is cancelled, and I have a hysteroscopy next week (on day 15?) instead. 

How could it possibly be retained tissue? How could it be visible on an ultrasound and not on last month's saline sono? What on earth is happening?

I can't believe I'm having yet another procedure.

I hope it is ok that I have come here to ask a question. My very close friend told me a few days ago that she and her husband are dealing with infertility and her husband was diagnosed some 6 months ago with Sertoli only syndrome. I am a married gay woman and she had lots of questions about donor sperm but she is also still holding on to hope that maybe with an open testicular surgery her husband could father a child biologically. Since I work in healthcare (and often have patients who require PGD or help with their fertility due to genetic conditions) my friend is inclined to ask me my opinion and I want to be honest but not misleading or pushy or... a bad friend basically.

So basically I want to be as supportive as I can but also not say the wrong things. I had a quick pubmed google session to understand the diagnosis a little more, but thought maybe other people with the same or a similar diagnosis could give me actual advice and suggestions on how to be supportive (beyond the obvious, like listening, being there, not bringing up kids when unnecessary, etc... that I have gathered from reading a little on this sub).

My lining was thin going into this, like maybe, MAYBE a 5, but probably less. Lining has been a consistent issue for me since we were doing IUIs a year ago (our first was over Thanksgiving last year).

So, I'm posting my story and asking for this group's collective wisdom. So far the only clear culprit seems to be my lining.

Here's my story:

* The HSG I had in August 2017 was clear, except for one spot in my uterus that could have been a possible, mild adhesion - I've never had an infection or D&C, so unknown cause.  I remember the Radiologist assured me that based on what he could see that was NOT causing my infertility. RE thought that it didn't require further investigation. We moved on to IUIs
* We did 3 IUIs and on the 3rd, I asked about my lining - no one had mentioned it yet, but my research indicated that it was something to ask about. My RE said it was on the ""thin side,"" but she wasn't worried b/c it was trilaminer. I was told it was around 6. Also, maybe the Clomid was thinning it out. We started a 4th IUI on letrozole, lining was still shit, so we cancelled and moved on to IVF.
* Hysteroscopy in March 2018 showed normal uterus, RE said something about removing something small, but I can't remember the specifics (which now seems crazy of me), I feel like she said it could have been some kind of growth from my cycle? I dunno, she didn't seem concerned AT ALL. (sidebar: I'm going to ask her about this when I see her next)
* When we did my retrieval, my RE decided against a fresh transfer b/c my lining was so shitty. We froze 7 blastocysts, and moved on to focus on lining.
* I spent May, June, July, and August on daily doses of Vitamin E and Pentoxyfylline - the idea here is to increase blood flow to the uterus to thicken the lining.
* In August I had a CP, so that delayed FET by a couple weeks.
* Finally at the end of August/early September we started Lupron to prep for FET, then I did a couple weeks of Viagra suppositories (also blood flow). First lining check = shit. Second lining check = also shit. The ultrasound technician was like ""weird it hasn't thickened at all since last week."" I was sure they would cancel, but RE pushed to try.
* Husband and I had a conference call with RE, she felt strongly that we needed to ""test"" the lining, assured us that she had seen success with thin lining before, and that we couldn't be sure that I had implantation failure unless we tried.  We told her we didn't want to do it if it was futile, and she felt that it wasn't. I asked her if we would  be having a different conversation if we only had 1-2 blasts, she said, ""yes, maybe.""
* FET #1 = Fail, as expected, but heartbreaking nonetheless. 

We meet with her in a couple weeks. I plan to do some research on the following and ask about:

1. ERA ( Endometrial receptivity test)
2. Endometrial Scratch
3. GCSF Infusion (Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor)
4. Immune system stuff (not sure where to begin with this, but feel like I see people reference pairing antibiotics with FETs?)
5. Natural Killer Cells (I have no idea what this is, I just see it pop up in lots of places)

My questions for all you brilliant people:

1. What am I missing?
2. What else should I be asking about/researching?
3. Anyone know of any magical solutions for lining issues?

Sunday was transfer day. We spent three days in Prague while we waited on embryo development before heading back to the clinic in Brno. Sorry that I didn't get to post until now. After transfer we headed to Barcelona to finish off our vacation so things have been kinda hectic.

On transfer day, we arrived at the clinic at our app't time. We waited around five minutes for the doctor to come and get us. We had a meeting where we discussed how many we would like to transfer and how the embryos were developing. They weren't really coming along as expected. Figures we travel half way across the world and all of a sudden, my husbands sperm (which he has never had a problem with) decide they want to have a 3.5% morphology rate. That being said, we got three good embryos. We were hoping for more, but as you ladies know, this IVF stuff is a crap shoot most of the time.  They also don't stim ladies here in the CZ as aggressively as they to in North America so we only had 11 eggs to start with and 7 fertilized. 

After that, we went into the exam room. It was bright and sunny. There was a very nice bathroom were I was told to change and my husband was asked to sit in the chair next to the exam table. It all happened really fast after that. I came out, got on the table, my doctor came in, asked us our names, transferred one embryo and then asked me to lie down for ten minutes. That was it. We than went downstairs to pay the remaining amount of our bill, pick up more prescriptions and head home. 

We walked the 45 minutes back to our Airbnb and then went out for Pho. Spent the rest of the day touring the Brno castle, went for dinner and then went to bed early because we had to be up at 6am to head to Barcelona.

Our experience thus far has been great. I would HIGHLY recommend those of you considering DIVF to consider the Czech Republic. Believe it or not, one of my close friends was in Prague doing DIVF at the same time as us! We didn't know each other was doing it, let alone doing it at the same time in the same country! We went to Prague and met up with her and her husband. It was so nice to see them both and get to share our thoughts and feelings on the whole thing. Her experience has been good too. 

Feel free to ask any questions. If I don't respond right away, it's because we are out and about exploring Barcelona.

Anyways last month my AFC at the IVF clinic was 1/1. I did max dose stim with HGH, puragon and menopur. On day 5 we stopped the cycle because I had one leading follicle and only two other small follicles.
This month I went in on day 2 to the IVF clinic and my AFC was 0/1. My FSH and LH were both high so we basically decided no IVF. I was devastated.
I had never had such low AFC on any previous tracked cycles through my IUI clinic and so I was starting to panic that my ovaries were done. Our plan was to do IUI consecutively if IVF was not happening. 
Anyways today I went to the IUI clinic CD3. Well the US tech called my AFC as 5/3! 
Now I am just super confused because my AFC shouldn’t change that much in one day...
I am waiting to hear back from the clinic about this because I told them about the results yesterday. 
Has anyone ever had variable AFC like this? I know it is incredibly subjective BUT when you are told IVF success with AFC < 5 is incredibly low then you would assume they trust it enough to make some important decisions.

Before IVF I was a Nationally qualified bikini competitor and as you can imagine spent most of my time in the gym and watching what I eat. We have had trouble conceving due to my husband's very poor morphology not due to my amount of exercise which I greatly reduced after competing. We did our IVF cycle in September and I was on activity restriction the entire month from the egg retrieval and having my Gastrointestinal procedures done as well (we met our deductible so I'm finally doing things I've put off due to cost). After September I had several moles removed. After the biopsies came back, I had to go back in to my dermatologist and get several margins excised (this has been a multiple appointment process). So each time I have an excision I get put back on activity restriction due to stitches. 

My RE is in contact with my dermatologist and my GI specialist so all of this was cleared beforehand and they told me I should do it in between my ER and FET. So basically I've not been allowed to workout since August and won't until mid November after my TWW post FET. 

On top of this, I have really been having terrible anxiety from my HORRIBLE family implosion with my sister this summer. I take medication for my Anxiety and bipolar which I'm on half dose for this process. So mentally I am exhausted and a nervous wreck. 

Birth control. Omg, fucking birth control. I have never been on birth control until I started IVF and my boobs are MASSIVE and it has wrecked my eating. Meat just is so hard to eat so I have been mostly snacking on Carby stuff which is all I can put down.

We had 10 eggs collected, 9 fertilize, and 7 embryos on Day 3, including two that were cavitating. But by Day 5, we only had two morulas and they degenerated overnight. This was our sixth IVF cycle, and while we do have several blasts frozen from past cycles, we've always had steep losses between Days 3 and 5.

Last month I initially wanted to do PGS, so we were waiting for the morulas to hopefully reach blast stage. But then they didn't, and we had nothing to transfer. Now I wonder if we should have just transferred them as morulas. Or even on Day 3. There's a lot of controversy about whether embryos might do a bit better in utero than in the lab. Some RE's say that the lab is just as good, but others say that no one can know for certain.

For this current cycle, I'm leaning in the other direction. Rather than aim for PGS on Day 5, I'm considering just doing a Day 3 transfer. Has anyone had success with Day 3 transfers when previous Day 5 transfers failed or were not feasible? If so, how many Day 3 embryos were transferred?

Side Notes:

\- Stories of success can be triggering within our community, so please keep any mention of success to a minimum (e.g., ""successful pregnancy""). I can PM for more details if need be. Mainly I'd be curious to know if the outcome was a singleton, twins, or higher order multiples.

\- I've cross posted to Infertility Babies, too. I hope that's ok.

\- This place has been an incredible resource for me in dealing with infertility. Thank you in advance for any info or guidance.

Apologies if this is a little jumbled. I would love to hear people’s experience or advice as this is all new to me.

My husband and I have been TTC for 1 year with fertility friend, doing everything possible. Temping, opk, timed intercourse. 
Clomid with no success. I am 35 already a few months we started having tests.

I had blood tests, vaginal ultrasounds etc etc and I’m fine, ovulating fine and hormone levels are good.
Last week my husband had a semen analysis, we never thought it would be him with an issue because I have a history of auto immune diseases (medicated and under control) but alas, his results were very bad. 1% motility, and mostly abnormal sperm.

This came as quite a shock and my husband found it very tough to deal with emotionally.  We have been told our only chance is with ICSI.

My husband is still concerned that due to his poor sperm quality that I might still miss carry of the baby could be born with issues. We have decided to do PGD anyway due to my age.

Our insurance doesn’t cover anything fertility related so we will be paying for this ourselves, therefore we really need to give ourselves the best chance as finances for this are limited and wherever we decide to do it would require flights and a few weeks of hotel stay.

I have been chatting with a few IVF clinics. We live in quite a remote place so it would need to be done abroad. We have a few options, the closest of which is just a 20 min flight away on the mainland. And if we do choose to have the ICSI there, we are in a country where they allow sex selection, and do not make you stick to only one embryo.

The clinic nearby has excellent success rates and has multiple practices in neighbouring counties. They do not see multiple pregnancies as a negative (twins.)

Now as we are paying so much already for ICSI and PGD, we have the option of choosing the sex (assuming we have enough embryos of each) and also we can choose how many embryos we would like to be transferred.

My question is, would you choose the sex of your baby, and how many embryos would you transfer if you knew it was possibly a one time attempt due to the logistics (needing 3 weeks off work plus considerable travel costs.)

We would be delighted with a singleton, or twins. In fact living where we do, twins, and them having each other as a playmate would be a huge advantage, because we will be here for the next few years and only see friends with children around once or twice a month. There is a local nursery but only for children aged 3 years and up.


I would love to hear some thoughts and experiences.

172,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi folks,

Welcome to my case discussion.

I would like to request a follow up appointment with my doctor. Yes, that means my doctor doesn't usually do WTF appointments. You just get the privilege of seeing him again for 5 minutes during cycle monitoring as usual to start a new cycle after a failed one. I would like to request a full appointment with him outside of cycle monitoring hours, and would like to come prepared.

After what has been a hell of a year, I am exhausted. So much information to sift through, so many possible routes to examine. I have come to understand that the range of experience/knowledge in this community is unsurpassed. I would like to welcome anyone to read the following, and let me know what you would want to do next. What have you experiences been with any of the following? What tests would you request? Anything you think would be beneficial for me to hear. I'm listening.

I am currently 29 years old. My egg retrieval was done at the age of 29+1 month. AKA 1 month earlier and my eggs would have been ""28"". The sperm donor we used to perform ICSI on the eggs is a 29 year old donor with multiple live births. We used pretty high doses of stims- 350 gonal F, 1 full vial of repronex for 11 days, added orgalutran the last few days. triggered with lupron.

We retrieved 11 eggs, all 11 were mature.

8 fertilized with ICSI.

8 made it to day-3.

5 made it to day-5 blasts.

Freeze all cycle. My clinic does not provide grades. I had a sneeky peek at my file once while it was sitting infront of me, and I did see them rank the embryos. 2 were ranked as ""#2""s, 3 were ranked as ""#3""s. I have no context as to what that means. For various reasons, we made the decision to not PGS test.

We transferred the first using a medicated transfer cycle. Estrace  (12 mg/day) starting day 3, 1 baby aspirin/day, Medrol for 4 days prior to transfer+transfer day, Progesterone suppositories (200mgx3 a day) starting 5 days prior to transfer. Day of transfer is day 6 on progesterone.  Transfer failed, negative beta.

We transferred the second using a medicated transfer cycle. Estrace  (12 mg/day) starting day 3, 1 baby aspirin/day, Medrol for 4 days prior to transfer+transfer day, Progesterone suppositories (200mgx3 a day) starting 5 days prior to transfer. Day of transfer is day 6 on progesterone. Added 10 mg of prednisone starting day 3.  This transfer resulted in a chemical. 4 beta draws 48 hours apart: 34, 45, 36, 10. (Roughly.)

We transferred the third using a medicated transfer cycle. Estrace  (12 mg/day) starting day 3, 1 baby aspirin/day Medrol for 4 days prior to transfer+transfer day, Progesterone suppositories (200mgx3 a day) starting 5 days prior to transfer. Day of transfer is day 6 on progesterone. 10 mg of prednisone starting day 3.  Intralipid infusion 5 days prior to transfer. Embryoglue.  1st beta draw is an 8. I've been asked to return for a follow up beta tomorrow and to stay on medication until then. I am not operating under false hope, I realize that a beta of 8 might as well be a negative beta. I apologize that it's technically mentioning ""success"" that has not been written off 100%, but let's be real, folks. This transfer resulted in a chemical.

I was diagnosed with mild hypothyroidism a couple of years ago. I am on 0.75 mg synthroid and this has kept my TSH in a normal range.

I was diagnosed with progesterone allergy  5 years ago (but have been affected by it for approximately 10 years). I receive Omalizumab (xolair) injections every 4 weeks to mediate the IgE reaction I have to both endogenous and exogenous progesterone. This is a Class-B drug for pregnancy, and my immunologist believes any risks are outweighed by benefits.

&#x200B;

We have also done 5 IUIs: 1 medicated clomid, 1 unmedicated, 3 medicated letrezole.

We had 1 success on a letrezole cycle which resulted in a missed miscarriage at 10.5 weeks with slow/abnormal growth. Testing of POC revealed Trisomy 20.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tests:

Clear HSG.

Clear  Sonohysterogram  .

The following are results that are from approximately July 2017. If you think anything should be retested at this point, please let me know.

&#x200B;

AMH 5.6 pmol/L -conversion: 0.78 ng/mL

DHEA-S 8.9 (Ref 0.9-11)

Prolactin 11.3 (Ref 4.7-23)

TSH 1.8 (Ref .27-4.2)

Total Testosterone 1.8 (Ref 0.29-1.6)

HematologyAPTT 24 (Ref 22-37)

INR 1.0 (Ref 0.9-1.3)

HBA1 97.2 % (Ref >96)

HbA2 2.5% (Ref 2-3.5%)HbF 0.3% (Ref <2.0%)

Hemoglobin A1C 5.0

Typical day 3 results: FSH \~6, E2 \~200.

Day 21 Progesterone was tested once during unmedicated IUI and and came back at 86

&#x200B;

I have never had: a hysteroscope, genetic testing, an endometrial scratch, an ERA.

&#x200B;

Would an ERA be useful at this point? How does it work with chemicals- does one assume that because some level of implantation is occuring that we are hitting the window? Or does it indicate that there may be room for improvement?

I'd like to request RPL panel.

Any other suggestions, or thoughts?Thank you so much.

Over 4 retrievals I have generated 11 blasts, of which 9 have been transferred with just 1 chemical (my only pregnancy came from another cycle with a day 3 transfer). Another cycle generated blasts but they were all PGS abnormal. At least one of the blasts was known PGS normal, the other 8 untested. 

Not all retrievals were done with my current clinic but after 7 blasts had been transferred with no pregnancy, my doctor offered an ERA before we transferred my last 2 blasts. 

He and I discussed that clearly the most likely answer is my eggs were old and doing the ERA was partly for ""piece of mind"" and partly bc I am planning to move to DE (In fact when I told him I was thinking of DE he became more supportive of doing the ERA). 

I got the results today and it turns out I am pre-receptive by 1 day. 

Now my family thinks I should do one last retrieval (they are offering to pay). My reserve is very good for my age: in Jan, AMH = 2.55, FSH =8.1; baseline ultrasound in August showed 15 follicles. 

How crazy is this given my age? 

Update: I spoke with my RE today and have decided to do one more retrieval. He said if I was faced with choosing between DE and OE as my last shot, I should do DE. But if I was able to handle a retrieval that it was good to try bc my results earlier this year were positive and the ERA results do show a change in protocol.

I've also done an ERA and have adjusted transfer time accordingly.  My TSH was tested last year at 2.79 and because I have no indications of thyroid disease, will not be treated for it.

I have read the post about what to do if your FET fails over and over and am at a loss. TSH very slightly over 2.5 wouldn't be causing this many problems, right?

It turns out I have 4 cysts between 1.9 and 2.4cm. Most likely created as a result of initial flare of fsh after starting superfact. 

I was on bcp for 18days and then on 0.2cc of superfact/Lupron for 8

My e2 levels are ridiculously high 1170. Well, this explains why I didn’t get a period after bcp. 

A nurse just called to tell me that my re decided to continue superfact for one more week. But really is there a point?

I found this research that shows that ‘cyst cycles’ are doomed. Poor quality embryos, lower pregnancy rates, and higher termination rates.
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.549.1463&rep=rep1&type=pdf

I don’t know what I should do now. I don’t want to waste time but  I also don’t want to waste my chance and money either. 
Additionally I’m worried about over suppression. 15 days of superfact seem like a long time. 

I was planning to do a FET after Ivf retrieval. Now I also wonder wether I should or could do  FET without ivf in this cycle. 

I would like to ask about your experiences:

1. How did you treat functional cysts before/during ivf? Cyst aspiration, bcp, Lupron, waiting, something else? What worked best?

2. Did you continue with ivf in the same cycle after cysts were resolved? Was the outcome of that ivf worse than you expected? 

3. Would you or did you continue with FET in spite of having a cyst? 


Update: on the next week scan there was only one 4cm cyst left. A week after that it grew to 5cm and my e2 levels skyrocketed to 2700. I booked a wtf appointment with my re and she finally came up with cyst aspiration. After the aspiration (OMG so f.. painful, no painkillers, no sedation) I continued taking superfact for 4 more days. After aspiration the cyst is still measuring 1.8cm but my e2 dropped to 162. I'm sure my afc is lower than usual but I don’t know how many follicles are exactly left because they don’t count. Just say ""multiple small"", ""few small"". Wtf does this even mean? 3,4, 20?

I am not quite sure how to ask this question but I have 5 blasts left that are all day 6 embryos. The grading is good and my RE told me not to focus on it. 

My last FET (2 5 day embryos)was successful after an ERA (plus a whole whack of extra meds) that determined I needed an extra 12 hours of progesterone. My biopsy was taken at 125 hours of exposure to progesterone, and the ERA (Igenomix) said to transfer at 137 +/- 3 hours. And we did the transfer at exactly 137 hours. 

I have thought about posting this in r/ttcafterloss as I am just reeling and throwing myself into what I will do next time...but I feel that are a lot more people here that are doing IVF and dealing with FET’s. 

My question is...does the timing of the transfer need to be adjusted with a day 6 embryo even with the ERA? 

Any help would be appreciated.

Now, MOST of the time we get along alright, she can be a little pushy and overbearing but she is also fun and we have a lot in common. I do things with her just us two frequently. Whenever we are on these trips babies obviously come up. She is very aware we need IVF because my husband got a sperm analysis done and knows when we want to start but that’s basically it on the actual ttc front (she knows how many we want and things like that too but that’s not relevant). Whenever we talk about IVF between us or with my husband and hers she’s supportive and excited for us. 


However, she is also one of those people that is a complete people pleaser. So we were at her house with some of her friends a few weeks ago and one of them is closeish to my age (7 years gap I believe?) and my FIL made a joke about my husband shooting blanks and the friend asked if we were trying and I said “kind of, not really. He’s infertile and we are hoping to start IVF early next year” and she immediately starts talking about how she’s so glad she’s waited to get settled and how We are so young so we need more time and if god wants us to have a baby then we will and all that crap and my MIL immediately jumps on board with her and they both start saying it! Seriously for the next hour all I heard was “yeah, if God wants it to happen it WILL happen” which was incredibly frustrating. My MIL also brought it up again the next day in a text but I didn’t respond and haven’t heard anything of the sort since (but we have talked about how great it is we are starting IVF soon 🙄) 


Then two days ago my husband had an appointment with his oncologist for a follow up. Husband asked her not to come and she did anyways (who other can of worms that I’m ticked off about). Well during this appointment we needed him to fill out some paperwork for livestrong. When we gave it to him he said “I really think you should try naturally first, it can happen” and I mentioned the SA and he said “that was so close to his chemo ending, it’s probably changed” (it was 4 months after he finished chemo and it’s only been 7 months since then so probably not but we do have another SA planned for that exact reason) and my MIL once again immediately jumped on with the doctor about how we haven’t been trying that long and shouldn’t be so concerned and he’s young so he will probably bounce back... yada yada yada. Well she was their uninvited so I wasn’t about to tell the doctor that we have been actively trying for 8 months already so we are nearing the year mark anyways (and probably will hit it before we start) because it’s weird to talk about planned sex with my husband in front of his mom, plus we got married 2 months ago as heaven forbid we had sex before then (yay religious in laws). So we don’t have the paper signed but will be going back soon because I’m ticked. She also called me yesterday to talk about how we really need to try longer before jumping into IVF. I stonewalled her and haven’t talked to her since but I’m just so pissed! Ugh. I just needed to vent. Sorry for the wall of text.

I had an 8w missed miscarriage almost exactly 13 months ago. Acute Deciduitis was listed on the pathology report. My RE said it was likely cleared up and a longer course of antibiotics aren't needed to do another transfer though I do antibiotics with my transfers anyway. I broke a molar during that pregnancy and also have a few other tooth related issues. I now need 3 extractions, a deep cleaning and one filling. I got this thought in mind that my teeth somehow caused this loss even though I've had two different consultations and no infections have been found over the last 13 months. One dentist a while back told me it could wait but it did need to be done.

 I have a total of 3 days of sick leave/PTO to do my dental work and fly across the country for my transfer. I can't take unpaid days off.

Getting my embryos shipped here would cost me a ton more with a local clinic so its not an option. My dentist doesn't work on Fridays or early in the mornings and she doesn't want to do bone grafts after the extractions even though I want implants later so that's less than ideal and I would have to take off during the week. My dental work could end up costing me much more and the search is taking me more time which has already pushed back my transfer from August.

I’ve been lurking here for a few weeks and working up courage to post here myself. 
Me and my husband recently found out that we would need help conceiving.
We found out September 13th and October 11th we had our fresh embryo transfer (not sure of the abbreviation - new to this ;) )
We are very very lucky that we can afford to do this privately (although my country has 3 tries for free through the “public” healthcare - it takes up to a year to wait though). 

All the medications, information and this whole process has gone very quickly so I’m a bit overwhelmed. 

I realize that most of us might have to go through this more than once, but I’m channeling all my positive energy to the egg currently in my stomach (weeeird haha). 

How did you guys make the weeks from the transfer to testing pass? 
Did you tell our family and close friends that you’re doing this? (We have not told anyone as my husband would like to keep this private so I feel very alone).

Thank you in advance :)

I feel like everything has being making me upset lately, which I'm sure the Clomid isn't helping. I hate being jealous of people with babies, I've never been like this before. My younger brother found out recently he is having a baby and I hate not being happy for them.

We didn’t do DNA fragmentation testing and it sounds like the local reproductive urologist has a long waiting list.  (Can it really be that hard to run a semen sample??)

It’s too late for our two blasts, but I’m wondering if we should DNA frag testing before we do any more retrievals.  

That is, if we even do another retrieval.  Obviously, if I lucked out and had a successful pregnancy, we wouldn’t need to.

I’m also wondering if I should do an ERA before any FET.  My clinic usually only does that after an unsuccessful transfer but they said they make exceptions for people with one or two blasts.

My spouse is an older guy and I’m nearing the end of my clinic’s allowable age for my own eggs.

I don’t feel like we have time to do the testing but I also feel like we only have a couple tries with our own genetic material.

I also don’t want to wait too long because my husband’s dad has been sick and we’d like for him to see his grandchild before he dies.

So time is not our friend and I feel like I have to rush.

We have good insurance coverage so the testing costs are not an issue and neither is one more egg retrieval.

I've just had my negative result of a 5 day FET and I have been researching implantation issues. To my knowledge everything went smoothly and a good quality embryo was transferred, so no fertility issues before embryo transfer. (Except I've never been pregnant or had a positive.)

My issue is that the more I research the more reason I have to believe that I may have an overreacting immune system.

Here are the reasons that I can think of:
1. My dad had latent autoimmune type 1 diabetes
2. I have psoriasis flares on my lips and my top lip flared up 5 days post transfer
3. I have mild contact dermatitis, where my skin raises for at least 30 minutes if I scratch
4. The progesterone pessaries were making my bits incredibly itchy and gave me a rash
5. When I tried to use the progesterone pessaries as suppositories (as recommended by the consultant), I was in agony with itching and burning pain
6. Diarrhoea 2 days post transfer
7. Stuffy nose for first 3 days post transfer
8. A history of having fevers after having sex with a new partner, or after having sex with my husband after a prolonged period of abstinence

Does this sound plausible as autoimmune implantation dysfunction?

If it does should I give the consultant the list of possible symptoms next time I go in for an appointment?

And also would it be possible to get tested/screened at the GPs if I explain the situation to them?

Since we went for PGD, our amount of embryos were halved by the time they were frozen (3 were frozen in total for this cycle). And we only have 2 embryos left in the freezer so I just want to make sure the next one is not wasted.

The knee jerk reaction is, if the previous five didn't work, CHANGE THE F'ING PROTOCOL, right?  Unfortunately the decision is not so simple due to the fact we only recently found out we transferred all eight of our previous embryos roughly 36 hours out of sync.

Historically my wife has had fairly good results from a short antagonist protocol, roughly 250-300 fsh and 75 menopur, usually stimming for 10 days, and starting ganirelix around day 6 or 7, and a HCG trigger.  This has resulted in between 12 and 19 oocytes, with a good rate of maturity, and a high fertilization rate (recently at least).  Some cycles have been better than others, giving us anywhere from 2 to 5 blasts by day 6.  They are usually slow growers, with most of our blasts being day 6.  Two recent AMH tests done days apart resulted in 1.44 and 1.97, and her day-3 FSH was mid 7's.  This is basically unchanged from when we started 2 years ago.

Here are our previous results:

IVF1 - 19R, 16M, 11F, 2 Blasts (2 day-5)  
IVF2 - 18R, 17M, 11F, 2 Blasts (2 day-6)  
IVF3 - 16R, 16M, 14F, 4 Blasts (Unknown day) 0 PGS Normal (Thawed Biopsy)  
IVF4 - 12R, 12M, 12F, 5 Blasts (2 day-5, 3 day-6) 3 PGS Normal  
IVF5 - 16R, 12M, 11F, 2 Blasts (2 day-6) 0 PGS Normal

We recently had a consult with a doctor that left our current practice, and he had a couple of ideas to try something different.  One idea was to substitute more menopur for FSH to try and coax a little better yield.   The other idea was to try a long lupron protocol, in the hopes of more uniform follicles and oocytes.  My wife does not seem to be at risk of OHSS, so that's not a concern.

We're undecided if we should leave well enough alone and hope for another good cycle with the protocol we've been using, or if we should try changing it just for the sake of change?  While we would love to continue with this particular doctor that left to start his own practice, the lab buildout is not done yet.  Since time is of the essence, we are limited to the same clinic we've used all along.  Is it worth pushing to change up the protocol which has been reasonably successful in the past?  Or should we just continue on autopilot, hoping for a repeat of IVF4 so we can transfer on the right day this time...

Dr says I get to go on birth control for the next month to make it go away. Also, while he was taking notes, I happened to notice him writing the word endometriosis on my chart. I asked him about it, not knowing what that means exactly.... but he's never been good at explaining his diagnoses to me, and the most I got out of him was that there's evidence of it in several of my ultrasounds.

He did a similar thing when telling me I have pcos, months ago. I asked him what it meant and he told me to Google it. 

He also never shares the exact numbers with me when I do blood tests. He just says ""your test shows that you ovulated"" or whatever.

The vibe of the song, the emotion behind it, and the words ""Nobody knows what I'm doing here...and I ain't got a clue"" just reverberate within my soul. 

On my worst days, one part of the song goes ""leave me, just leave me, leave me"" and I can just imagine saying this to my husband one day. All he has ever wanted is a family and I am afraid this depressing journey doesn't have a guaranteed happy ending.

I'm sorry this is long, but I am so confused and have no one to talk to about this.

**Background:**

I had my first round of IVF in August.  They transferred one and froze one embryo.  I have met my OOP max for insurance for the year so my goal is to do another round of injections before the end of the year so it will be covered.

But insurance says I have to do an FET before they'll pay for another injection round.

\- I don't have many options in my state for clinics and for a long list of reasons I have chosen to go out of state. I have done the research and chosen a new clinic in Texas to do my next round.  

\- I started my last period on Sept 6th.  My cycle is never predictable but its never been longer than 35 days.

\-I have to do my FET at the local clinic.  I had an appt with them on the 19th and he said he'd check to make sure I hadn't ovulated the following week and if I hadn't, he'd put me on Provera to speed up my period so we could do the FET as soon as possible.  He also ordered an MRI and endometrial biopsy to see why the first round wasn't successful and I didn't produce quality embryos. **He sent me a message saying the biopsy was negative.**

\- I had an in person appt with the clinic in Dallas last week (while I was on Provera) so that I could jump into an IVF round quickly if FET doesn't work.

\-He did an ultrasound and saw a couple of follicles (can't remember the size).

\- I finished my Provera on Sunday, still have not started my period, but when I messaged my current clinic they said that it could take up to two weeks to start my period.

\-SO I am now on day 34 of my cycle, no period yet and have felt VERY loopy the past couple of days, I am wondering if it is because of the drop in estrogen or the absence of provera?  WTF is wrong with my brain?  Its also been a tough week because my grandpa fell and has been in the hospital.  

\- What was the f'ing point of starting me on Provera to make me start my period if it didn't work?  Did it screw me up?

&#x200B;

Can I cuss in this sub? Because I would love to drop some F bombs.  I am so sick of my doctors putting me on God knows what drugs and having no ability to figure out what they're doing to my mind.  I ask them about side effects and they say headaches etc.  I already take Lamictal and Celexa for anxiety issues.  Come to find out birth control all but cancels out Lamictal when you take it.  WELL my clinic had me on BCP for 6 weeks this summer, no wonder I was a complete shit show.  

I have felt fantastic the past month until this week.

Our first IUI was exciting and our nerves were all over the place. This time I had to take ovudril and I was so scared as to why I would need to if last time I didn’t. My question is for someone who ovulates normally and doesn’t have any issues with her cycle other than endometriosis, why did I have to take the ovudril? The first IUI I had one follicle that was 23 mm and husbands sperm count was 100 million with all swimming. But I didn’t have to take the trigger.

This time, I have 2 follicles at 23 mm and one at 17 mm and husband sperm count was the same as last time. This time I’m making sure we have sex tonight, and tomorrow just in case it took the ovudril 36 hours to work. I don’t know why they would do the insemination today if I took the ovudril last night at 8pm, and my insemination was at 8am today and most people say the shot will make you ovulate 12-36 hours after the shot. 

Do you think an appointment later in the day would have been better? 

IUI went fine this time though I had a wave of anxiety rush over me in the procedure room and wasn’t sure if that was the ovudril side effects kicking in. The NP took a little longer than last time to get the catheter in than last time but I had wayyyy less cramping this time. 

Also I have noticed how much more hornier I am with this IUI cycle than last one. The doctor said it may be because my estrogen is a lot higher (it was 942 on day 12) I was super surprised at how much that increased (my libido)

'Fertility Enhancement' as the IRS calls it is expensive AF especially for my fellow self-pays.

Wanted to make sure everyone knows that you can deduct a lot of it *including* hotel stays and transportation. This is what is on the IRS site: Fertility Enhancement

You can include in medical expenses the cost of the following procedures to overcome an inability to have children.

* Procedures such as *in vitro* fertilization (including temporary storage of eggs or sperm).  
 
* Surgery, including an operation to reverse prior surgery that prevented the person operated on from having children.

and this is an article describing how that works:

something to note - the article lists 10% as the threshold but it is actually 7.5%: *Public Law 115-97,* t*he Tax Reform Act of 2017, enacted on  December 22, 2017, changed the AGI threshold for medical expenses from  10% to 7.5% for 2017 (and 2018).*

just wanted to share as we could all use a bit of $ back...
