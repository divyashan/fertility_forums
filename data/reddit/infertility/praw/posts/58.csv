13,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I talked to my dad last night for a while. He's a pretty strong christian and spends a lot of time in private praying. I just started taking a new supplement \(just to see if it helps at all\) and I asked him if he would include me in his prayers. He said he already prays for me, but not about the baby stuff. I told him we've been trying for so long and I dont know how much more I can take, so the more prayers going up for me, the better. He told me I should stop trying and let God handle it, that I didnt need medicine and that if it was in God's plan, he would provide and that he will give me my heart's desire if I follow him. Then he said, ""Honestly I've never asked God to give you a baby. It may not be in His plan for you. Even if it is, I dont think it is right now. You both are too young and immature to have kids. I honestly dont think you need one yet.""

Hmm. Let's think about this logically. \(NOT BRAGGING, JUST SAYING\) I am 29, my husband is 28 this year. We've both got steady jobs bringing in more income than my parents. We own three vehicles. We own a large beautiful home sitting on lots of land, we care daily for 6 pets. Our pets are healthy and happy and visit the vet regularly. Our home stays clean. I work two jobs just to keep busy. My boss depends heavily on me to keep his business running. Neither of us do any kinds of drugs, neither of us drink beyond a beer or some wine after work. Neither of us smoke anything. We've done everything the right way, we waited until we were married and had a nice home and steady income before trying for kids. We have a room completely ready for a child, the closet full of baby items. We have good health insurance that will only increase by $20 a month to have a child. We have enough savings and credit to easily survive maternity leave. That doesn't say young and immature to me. That shows a couple who has worked their ever living asses off to get ready for a family and still has nothing to show for it.

So at nearly 30, Im not ready for a baby, but yet my older sister had his full support when she ran away from home and got knocked up at 18. He's never said a word to her about them not being ready for a child. After her first was born and they started trying for the second, he never once said a word about it. He was full of joy at the thought of another grandchild. Now that Im trying, all of a sudden he's against it. I thought all this time he had supported us. Now I find out after 4 years that he doesn't think we need a baby. This hurts. As if Mother's day wasn't painful enough to begin with.

It may not be in God's plan for us to be parents. That may very well be true. But the only one who knows that is God. I feel more alone than ever now. I haven't told my husband what he said yet, I dont even know if Im going to. All I know is I feel like one of my biggest support rocks just stabbed me in the back.

Edit: Thanks for all the kind words. This was a pretty tough pill to swallow. I think he's wrong. Plain and simple, I think we're ready and have been for some time now. I have approximately 11 years until 40. My clock is ticking and Im bound and determined to have a child regardless of his feelings about it.

Then he said, &quot;Honestly I&#39;ve never asked God to give you a baby. It may not be in His plan for you. Even if it is, I dont think it is right now. You both are too young and immature to have kids. I honestly dont think you need one yet.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm. Let&#39;s think about this logically. (NOT BRAGGING, JUST SAYING) I am 29, my husband is 28 this year. We&#39;ve both got steady jobs bringing in more income than my parents. We own three vehicles. We own a large beautiful home sitting on lots of land, we care daily for 6 pets. Our pets are healthy and happy and visit the vet regularly. Our home stays clean. I work two jobs just to keep busy. My boss depends heavily on me to keep his business running. Neither of us do any kinds of drugs, neither of us drink beyond a beer or some wine after work. Neither of us smoke anything. We&#39;ve done everything the right way, we waited until we were married and had a nice home and steady income before trying for kids. We have a room completely ready for a child, the closet full of baby items. We have good health insurance that will only increase by $20 a month to have a child. We have enough savings and credit to easily survive maternity leave. That doesn&#39;t say young and immature to me. That shows a couple who has worked their ever living asses off to get ready for a family and still has nothing to show for it.</p>

<p>So at nearly 30, Im not ready for a baby, but yet my older sister had his full support when she ran away from home and got knocked up at 18. He&#39;s never said a word to her about them not being ready for a child. After her first was born and they started trying for the second, he never once said a word about it. He was full of joy at the thought of another grandchild. Now that Im trying, all of a sudden he&#39;s against it. I thought all this time he had supported us. Now I find out after 4 years that he doesn&#39;t think we need a baby. This hurts. As if Mother&#39;s day wasn&#39;t painful enough to begin with.</p>

<p>It may not be in God&#39;s plan for us to be parents. That may very well be true. But the only one who knows that is God. I feel more alone than ever now. I haven&#39;t told my husband what he said yet, I dont even know if Im going to. All I know is I feel like one of my biggest support rocks just stabbed me in the back.</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for all the kind words. This was a pretty tough pill to swallow. I think he&#39;s wrong. Plain and simple, I think we&#39;re ready and have been for some time now. I have approximately 11 years until 40. My clock is ticking and Im bound and determined to have a child regardless of his feelings about it. He doesn&#39;t have to like it, he&#39;s not the one raising the baby.</p>

Maybe the day is bittersweet as you celebrate with a child while grieving the sibling you thought you’d be able to give them (maybe you feel guilty about being sad on this day.  you shouldn’t).

I see you.  I see you smiling on the outside and sobbing on the inside, trying to put on a brave face for everyone celebrating around you.  I see you still in your pajamas, drinking wine on the couch and trying to tune it all out.  I see you serving brunch and ringing up Mother’s Day gifts, caring for patients, answering calls.  Smiling brightly because you need this job to pay for treatments, dying inside.  I see you.

I learned last year that Mother’s Day was founded to honor Ann Jarvis.  Historians think she had gave birth to 13 children.  She buried nine of them.   She went on to become a community organizer and activist, working to improve hygiene so that other mothers wouldn’t have to watch their children succumb to preventable diseases. 

When the Civil War broke out, her organization expanded their mission to caring for soldiers from both sides of the conflict.  They fed, clothed and tended to the wounded, enemy or not.  They committed to mothering each other’s children, sitting with the dying and burying the enemy dead with proper honors.

What Hallmark has failed to remember is that Mother’s Day is as much about grief as it is about joy.  As much about sisterhood as it is about motherhood.  As much about pouring love into other women’s children as it is about giving birth to your own.  

This day is for all of us.  For the joyful, the grieving, the hopeful and the hopeless.  It’s for the mothers and the aunties and the foster moms and the someday moms.  It’s for the teachers who pour their souls into other people’s children and for the nurses who tend to  them so carefully.  It’s for anyone who has made space in their world for somebody’s child, even when it hurts.  It’s for anyone who pretty much raised herself.  

Some of you here have stepped up to mother me when I was feeling broken and alone.  I see that kind of maternal nurturing in this sub daily.  Some of us had awful moms and you have stepped up to soothe our hurts with words like honey and sage advice.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

17,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"They're not my live children, but I figure better safe than sorry. 

So I'm in New York for work, and I hadn't seen my friend in a long time, so I made arrangements to stay with her and her family. 

It was bedtime and the kids wanted me to read them a story, which I was game for. The kids sat on my lap and I read them some book, and of course they wanted to hear another. So they pick another one, it's about shabbat, a concept the daughter is really into at the moment. So I started to read, and it's cute and then at they end they talk about the best part of the day. Which is a miracle, and that miracle is having children. And man, I totally lost it. If I have kids, it *will* be a #$@$ing miracle. My friend's kids are super into the book and do not realize that my voice has cracked and I can barely speak. I squeak out, ""what animals do you see?"" because I can't even read the rest of the page. My friend is there and she is mortified—she knows about my struggles, and I know she didn't remember the book would take that turn. 

Then (unintentionally) she made it worse by calling attention to it! She said, ""aw, I think the book is making nobelle emotional, do you want to give her a hug?"" and I was thinking, NOOOO! They don't even notice! Don't tell them, because then I'll have to say WHY I'm crying. And I don't want the kids to think that they did something wrong by asking me to read them that book, y'know? But I can't say anything without bawling, so I just get through it. The kids might be confused, but thankfully don't make too much of it, and I also tell them they don't have to hug me if they don't want to. I don't like the idea of forcing little kids to give hugs. But given this free agency, then they want to, which was nice. 

So then I was a little on edge, and the next day was her three-year-old's birthday party. And I knew that was going to be hard, so I gave myself permission to sneak away if I had to. I knew everyone would be too busy to notice, and my friend would understand anyway. 

Right away, the mothers show up and start talking solely about parenting stuff. Even if I were perfectly happy with my present situation, I would have felt totally left out and awkward. Luckily there were a few dads around who were interested in other things to talk about, so I chatted them up. Then one of them asked ""which one is your daughter?""—a question I expected people would ask—but it still hurt a bit. He was apologetic; I guess it must have showed, but we were able to laugh it off. Oh, good ole humor as a defense mechanism. 

And then we had the birthday cake and song; I didn't want to miss it. I mean, I love my friend and her family and I want to be there for these moments. Maybe someday I'll have a kid, maybe I won't. And if I won't, then at some point, hopefully, I'll make peace with my situation, and I'll have wanted this time with her kids. I want to see them grow up and become people and be there for them. But it is bittersweet, and I got to thinking. I've known this friend for 30 years, most of our lives. Where will we be in another 30 years? She'll have a lifetime, most likely, of memories with her family. I know I will have a lifetime of happy memories too—but I would like it if kids were a part of it. 

So after the song was over, I snuck away to just decompress a bit. The whole weekend I just felt on the edge of tears, and their house has thin walls, so I never felt comfortable letting it all go. But now that I'm in a hotel room of my own and can cry as much as I want, but the tears just aren't coming. 

Maybe because I wrote it down. I dunno. But thanks for letting me get it out and giving me a space to just share my sadness.

I'm not a fan of Mothers Day for a few reasons.

 The most obvious one being that we've been TTC for 3 years with no luck. However, I also have a super shitty relationship with my mom (and dad) and haven't spoken to them since 2015, after a couple years of a tumultuous kind-of relationship. She's an alcoholic and becomes very abusive when drunk (which is daily), and he's an enabler that just looked away or apologised to me later in secret--never stepping in to help his child that was being called fat, a slut (as a 9 year old), a bitch, etc. The best nights were when she graphically told me how she was going to kill herself and that it was my fault.  You get the picture. 

Isn't it ironic that that woman had 4 children very easily, and I'm having all these issues and childless after THREE YEARS of trying and treatments? Life is swell. 

Anyway, I really really dislike mothers day and do my best to stay off the more cringe-y social media sites like Facebook and Insta on this day.  My husband works in social work/criminal justice at a residential facility with at-risk youth, so his schedule doesn't care about weekends/holidays and he's working. I would typically keep my mind off of it by going out and about, but obviously every restaurant, store, event, etc is centered on mothers day.

48,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I introduced myself in the monthly intro thread but wanted to go in a bit more detail about current things. It felt too long to post in the dailies, so I’m making a separate post. This is mostly a vent as I don’t have anyone in real life to talk about this.

I did two rounds of IVF last year and had 3 PGS normal embryos (all from the same cycle – 2 good, 1 fair). I've had three FETs since then and all have been failures. The first resulted in an HCG of 0, the second was low, but doubling Betas and a blighted ovum at 7 weeks, and the most recent one was a CP (low, not doubling Betas). Prior to the most recent FET, I had another retrieval cycle and now have 3 more PGS normal embryos frozen (all are high quality).

Last week at my WTF appointment we reviewed the cycles and discussed next steps. My RE doesn’t want to rule out an embryo issue as I've had implantation, but the embryos aren't growing correctly, and all are from the ER same cycle. So, maybe it’s a bad batch of eggs – is that possible?

More likely though, it is a uterine issue. I’ve had some issues with my lining, so we’ve resorted to using a low dose of Gonal-F and it works to bring my lining past 8mm. I needed a D&C after my second cycle and had a hysteroscopy (OH) to check for scarring. During the OH, they did not find scarring, but they did find an atypical septum which I had removed surgically in March. During the WTF, my RE said she was a bit anxious about my uterus (me too), but said she’d recommend doing two more transfers using the new batch of eggs. 

I’m going to take a break for most of the summer due to travel but want to approach the next transfer in a good headspace. If that’s a failure, I’m not sure about my next steps. I feel like I’ve done almost everything on the “What to do if your FET fails” post – I’ve had an ERA to confirm receptivity, my biopsy was negative for endo, and I’ve done antibiotics prior to the last two cycles. My bloodwork showed Leiden Factor 8, so I will take Lovenox in case of a positive Beta. My RE seems open to trying some of the things we haven’t done yet (Intralipids, etc.), but I would have to drive that discussion. 

There’s a growing part of me that worries that I’m just blowing through embryos and the real problem is me. I asked her if there was a point where she would recommend I not continue to move forward. She said if I had one embryo left, she'd want to have the discussion about using a gestational carrier.

While my end goal is to have a child, I don't feel ready to make the leap to a GC now - I'm not sure if I ever will, but I'm trying to keep an open mind about things. Over the past few years, I've found myself doing a lot of things I never thought I would, so I don't want to rule anything out. If I manage to be successful, my path to motherhood is already radically different than I ever thought it would be.

Right now, I’m just sad about this whole thing. I’m tired of being in a state of limbo, and it’s becoming harder to feel positive about my future. I’m hoping to spend my time this summer getting into better shape (physically and mentally), so I can approach my next cycle as positively as possible, but right now it’s just hard.

Some background - I’m a 30F that does not ovulate on my own (or very rarely, maybe a couple times a year at most), high AFC (20+ each ovary), high AMH (around 9), normal FSH and LH, normal HSG. I can’t even remember all the other tests I’ve done at this point. Sounds like PCOS based on my stats, but doctor doesn’t want to diagnose me with that - passed insulin/glucose test, low BMI, ovaries are less “pearl necklace” and more crap ton of follicles all over, etc. Husband has a completely normal semen analysis. I’ve been doing multiple rounds/dosage levels of letrozole and I’m not responding. At this point my doctor is pushing for injectables with IUI. However, I’m thinking that still has a pretty low success rate and they are telling me that the same medicine (although I’m sure higher doses plus other medicines), is what’s used for IVF. I guess this is just a pretty large leap for me to move to injectables, so wondering if you guys would suggest the even larger jump of going straight to IVF. My insurance has a 20k lifetime max (regardless of treatment type), so I guess that’s also factoring into my decision (spend less money now on injectables with lower likelihood of success, or spend more now going straight to IVF).

My insurance has a 20k lifetime max (regardless of treatment type), so I guess that’s also factoring into my decision (spend less money now on injectables with lower likelihood of success, or spend more now going straight to IVF).</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for reading my wall of text. As much as I’ve been an observer up to this point rather than a contributor, I truly appreciate this community. Any advice is appreciated and I hope I am welcome here!</p>

My husband and I have been trying for about 5 years now \(we're 33\), and have done a range of Clomid, IUI, Letrozole, and most recently, moved to IVF. When I originally went to my RE, we were unexplained, but during my IVF cycle he found a chocolate cyst on one of my ovaries and finally gave me an ""official"" diagnosis of endometriosis causing our fertility issues. Everything else seems to be okay\- good sperm, no tube issues, good lining measurements, very very consistent cycles, I ovulate on my own, etc. Only two possible things to monitor were slightly elevated prolactin and my AMH was 2.48.

My first IVF cycle we retrieved 11 eggs, 8 of which fertilized! We did a fresh transfer of 2 embryos which failed \(October\), then a frozen transfer of 2 which also failed \(December; no embryos left\). My RE doesn't yet see any need to alter the protocols we used, but I felt like I needed to do SOMETHING, so I had surgery to drain the cyst we saw and check for other endo at the beginning of March \(I know there are differing opinions on if this is a good choice, too late now\). I don't think my doctor gave me a ""rating"", but said there was much more than he would've expected considering I have zero symptoms.

My huge debate now is how long to try before going back to IVF. I was actually recommended to this RE by someone who had the surgery and conceived naturally afterwards, and I really wanted to try for a while before going back. However, I've now had 2 cycles since my surgery and am of course not pregnant, as expected, and am getting anxious. Do I wait it out a little longer? Run back to my RE right away? Go to another RE for a second opinion? Hoping to find anyone else that has had similar choices to make. Obviously the endometriosis will be back, so I feel like I'm on limited time no matter what.

In case it's helpful, my IVF consisted of Follistim, Gonal F, Ganirelix, and Menopur.  I'm super behind about all the terminology I see used to describe the protocols. :\) Also, we did not do any embryo testing, my RE didn't think we needed to at this point.

My husband did 2 SA's in Dec/Jan and received some mixed results. On one hand, one of his tests was normal with the only low value being morphology \(2&#37;\) and his other test was not very great \(motility dropped from 58&#37; to 4&#37;, progressive sperm from 35&#37; to 0&#37; and total motile sperm went from 30.6 to 7.9 million\) but morphology went up \(5&#37;\). Everything else remained normal. He was also sick with a fever the day before his 2nd test, so the doctors aren't really sure if that had effected his results. He goes back for a follow up test next month. 

I met with my RE initially in March for a consult and had to wait 3 weeks for CD3 for testing. He ran TSH, FSH, LH, progesterone, prolactin, estradiol, and AMH. Everything was normal except I have low AMH which was 0.31. He also ran an SHG on CD12 instead of an HSG which came back normal. Ovaries, tubes, uterus, all look good. I [chart on FF](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/CK257) and ovulate regularly each month. 

When we met with the RE last week to discuss our results and plans for the future he labeled us as unexplained infertility. While we both have test results which could label us as MFI or DOR he can't say for certain that those are the reasons we haven't been getting pregnant. He also said they aren't glaring reasons for infertility on their own. And since I do ovulate, and my husband has a test saying he is capable of producing good sperm, it could just be that these bad tests are hindering our chances. Since we're unexplained, he said this only gives IUI an 8\-10&#37; chance of success, which I understand. If MFI is part of our issue, he said our chances could go up to 20&#37;. IVF would give us a 45&#37; chance. 

Our insurance covers 6 IUI and 6 IVF so he suggested a couple of IUI's and then move to IVF if we wanted, and we both agreed since it's less invasive we'd like to start with the IUI. He has me taking 50mg of clomid when my next cycle starts and they asked if I wanted a trigger shot or just track ovulation with OPKs \(which I already use them since we've started TTC\). He said the only difference is that with OPKs their window of timing for the IUI is down to 24 hours whereas they have about 36 hours after the trigger. If I'm ovulating regularly each month, is there any reason to do the trigger? He left it up to us to decide and I haven't called back yet with my decision, but you all have been through much more, and I'm just looking for other experiences. I'm not against the trigger, but I feel like the less I have to inject into my body the better. Is it true that the only difference is the timing?

Since we&#39;re unexplained, he said this only gives IUI an 8-10&#37; chance of success, which I understand. If MFI is part of our issue, he said our chances could go up to 20&#37;. IVF would give us a 45&#37; chance. </p>

<p>Our insurance covers 6 IUI and 6 IVF so he suggested a couple of IUI&#39;s and then move to IVF if we wanted, and we both agreed since it&#39;s less invasive we&#39;d like to start with the IUI. He has me taking 50mg of clomid when my next cycle starts and they asked if I wanted a trigger shot or just track ovulation with OPKs (which I already use them since we&#39;ve started TTC). He said the only difference is that with OPKs their window of timing for the IUI is down to 24 hours whereas they have about 36 hours after the trigger. If I&#39;m ovulating regularly each month, is there any reason to do the trigger? He left it up to us to decide and I haven&#39;t called back yet with my decision, but you all have been through much more, and I&#39;m just looking for other experiences. I&#39;m not against the trigger, but I feel like the less I have to inject into my body the better. Is it true that the only difference is the timing?</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve gotten this far, thank you for reading! Any anecdotal experiences are welcome.</p>

We just got a call from our urologist and based on test results, he has given us 2 choices: 1) varocicele surgery for my husband in hopes that it'll increase his count. Maybe after the surgery we could conceive naturally or have enough count to try IUI. Option 2) is to start banking sperm and go to IVF once we have 1000 motile sperm frozen. 

Has anyone here ever been faced with this choice before? It would be really hard for us to scrape up enough to pay for IVF, but we don't want to have to pay for the less expensive varicocele surgery if it might not end up working anyway. For reference, my husband's testosterone is 432, LH 8.7, FSH 13.5. On his last sperm analysis he had a total count of 490, ~170 of which were motile. We are getting him tested for Y chromosome microdeletions before we make our final decision.

We started seeing our RE in December.  Got all the tests.  Turned out one tube was blocked and I had uterine fibroids so had surgery to correct both.  Then I learned that my AMH was .03 (.59 on a repeat test).  I don’t know why my RE went forward with the laparoscopy when my AMH was so low because my RE gave either natural or IUI a low chance of success.  

RE said that there is a 5% chance of success with IVF so we decided to go straight to donor eggs.  Basically I am so emotionally drained at this point I just wanted to go for whatever had the best chance of working.  At that point my RE said we could begin the process before the end of April.  He put me on birth control so we wouldn’t have to wait for a full cycle.  But then after 3 weeks of waiting, my insurance denied me for donor eggs.  They are requiring 2 failed IVF cycles before they will cover donor eggs.

So after 5 months with the RE we finally got insurance approval for IVF.  Only to find out today that we can’t get scheduled for the retrieval until mid-July.   So we have to wait 2 more months to start IVF, which has an extremely low chance of success, just so we can fulfill the insurance requirement.  I looked into switching to a different clinic, but their wait is just as long.

I am so frustrated.  By the time we get to IVF I will have spent 5 months on birth control so we have not even been able to try on our own this whole time.  It will have been over 8 months from my first appointment with the RE before we even get to try anything.   I know I am very fortunate to have insurance coverage.  I am so grateful for that.

Ready?

Step one is to choose your survival shelter.  Mine is my bathtub (and also my couch).  The important thing here is to make sure it’s comfortable and isolated from the outside world. 

Step two, take care of all your holiday related errands.  If you still need to get your mom a gift, this is not a year to get something super-personal.  Pick something and move on.  

Whatever you do, *avoid the Mother’s Day card aisle at all costs.*  Do yourself a favor and head directly to the boxes of blank notecards and pick a design that will work for all the matriarchs you need to send cards to.  Bonus tip, put a piece of scrap paper in the box and keep track of who you’ve sent this design to.  

Step three is to stock your bunker with survival supplies.  You know those crazy people on disaster prep shows who have a room full of canned tuna, bullets, and wound dressings?  That needs be you, but with bath bombs, prosecco, sheet masks, and chocolate.  You don’t want to be unprepared when the apocalypse begins.  Treat yourself to a copy of a book you’ve been wanting to read or a new video game.  Anything that will get you out of your head a little bit.

Okay, so now you’re prepared for the inevitable destruction.  

On Friday at 5pm, delete all social media apps from your phone.  All of them.  If you choose to keep your Reddit app so you can snark with your fellow barren bitches, unsubscribe from the following subs:  pics, aww, funny, gifs, twoxchromosomes, and anything else likely to draw vomit inducing Mother’s Day posts.  

Lock yourself in your bunker (taping plastic over your windows  is optional) and DO NOT LEAVE YOUR DWELLING FOR ANY REASON.  The outside world will cease to exist for the next 72 hours. 

For those of you who have to work this weekend and can’t shelter in place, WE SALUTE YOU.  You are our heroes, you beautiful brave warriors.  

In Bolivia, Mother’s Day is celebrated on the anniversary of a battle in which the women took up arms to defend the freedom of their people.  Remember them as you enter bravely into battle with your own demons. Then get home as quick as you can for some well deserved self care.  

Do not, under any circumstances, look at social media until *at least* Tuesday morning.  

Practice excellent self-care this weekend friends.  You are not alone and your sisters have your back.  ❤️



*To our friends in other countries for whom this advice comes months too late, forgive me.  Grief  made me self-absorbed, and I forgot to get this up until it personally affected me.

The first month I also had an accompanying bruise but I think this is just because I bruise super easy (every blood draw leaves me bruised regardless of who does it or where I get it done).

I have told my specialist about it and whilst he was slightly concerned thay I had a reaction to it he did also tell me that there was nothing else he could prescribe to trigger.

It's located at http://kimheewoon.wixsite.com/understandingif. I tried to cover as much as I could to incorporate everything, but I'm sure I'm missing some things. Also, it will probably be best for people just getting into it - the seniors like me will probably find it a refresher at most.

I hope it helps some of you guys out anyway!

On day  5 of stims our ultrasound showed no follicles.  Our consultant wanted us to continuing stimming 225 gonal f and 225 menopur to see if their are changes.  Devastating.

Day  10 stims the ultrasound  showed 3 to 4 follicles growing on left ovary only with the largest being 10mm. Some hope but still not great.

Day 14 stims.  The ultrasound now shows 1 follicle at 14mm on left ovary.  Then another 4 small follicles on left ovary and another 3 to 4 small follicles on right ovary.  The consultant can't advise if this is good or bad...as it could mean there are abnormalities but also not enough study has been done on this either to give decisive results.

Our clinic is super surprised on this and have given us 2 options...and we are struggling to decide what to do.

Option 1.  To focus on the larger follicle and go for trigger and egg retrieval once size is around 17 to 18mm.  This is risky duento not finding the one egg etc.

Option 2.  To stop stimming for a few days.  Ovulate with the larger follicle and then start stimming again to see where we can go with the rest of the smaller follicles.  

Im not sure what would be the best option as with option 2 even though their is quantity....the quality may not be there.  With option 1 as the 1 follicle is growing steadily and quantity is low here...it may have the quality.

I have a few hours to decide....and am interested in hearing about similar experiences you may have had....whether it ended in a good or a not so great result.

112,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I recently moved to a new state. I know almost no one, and making friends has been tough but I met a woman about 6 months ago who has a young son (11 months). She struggled for many years with infertility. She has severe endo, had many miscarriages, and was finally able to carry her son to term on her third round of IVF. She quickly decided she will no longer try for another due to both cost, and more importantly the overwhelming emotional struggles trying again would bring on. I empathize with her as well as anyone with no experience can, though she wants more children she don't feel it is in the cards.

My partner and I are planning to start trying for a baby within the next year. Neither of us have children and have never tried before so I have no idea what our fertility may look like. 

This woman has become a very close friend of mine. Her friendship and support mean so much to me, but as I'm sure all of you are aware, her infertility struggles are part of the fabric of who she (and her family) is/are. I'm worried that if I become pregnant quickly - or even not quickly but do not have a decade of struggles as she has - that our friendship will suffer. I have lurked here long enough to know what pain that causes women with varying levels of infertility to see others get pregnant easy, or at all. Maybe I underestimate her, and it wouldn't be a problem at all, but I care a lot about her and her feelings.

I hope this is not insensitive to ask here, but I don't know where else to turn. Should I talk to my friend and let her know I am planning to try in the next year or so? Can you give me advice on anything I can do or say now/soon that might make it so that this new but meaningful friendship doesn't change or dissipate? I hate to think that something positive in my life would cause her sadness or pain in any way and I want to do anything in my power to treat this situation with the sensitivity it deserves.",t2_1bxfcxlj,False,,0,False,How to foster a new friendship with someone who has had 10 yrs of infertility struggles,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8hxg2f,False,dark,0.55,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1525821155.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I recently moved to a new state. I know almost no one, and making friends has been tough but I met a woman about 6 months ago who has a young son (11 months). She struggled for many years with infertility. She has severe endo, had many miscarriages, and was finally able to carry her son to term on her third round of IVF. She quickly decided she will no longer try for another due to both cost, and more importantly the overwhelming emotional struggles trying again would bring on. I empathize with her as well as anyone with no experience can, though she wants more children she don&#39;t feel it is in the cards.</p>

I would like to clarify the rules around mentioning successful treatment, living children, and pregnancies. This is from the sidebar:

> Mention of pregnancy or live children is a touchy subject in this forum, but may be discussed in neutral, sensitive language, especially in the context of making an introduction or answering a question about success with a particular treatment protocol. Statements of medical facts are very helpful (ex. “We had success after using xyz protocol"" instead of ""my first IUI resulted in my 2 year old daughter""), but unprompted discussion of pregnancy or children may not be well-received and may be removed.

If there is a post asking about treatment options and someone responds with ""I had success with femara,"" that is **not** a reportable issue. We have been getting lots of reports on posts like this, which are 100% allowed. Intro posts that mention previous success in neutral language, are also allowed. It should be a passing comment as a fact of their medical history. There should not details about child's age, name, how amazing they are, etc. Posts like this **should be** reported.

To summarize:

* ""I had success with xyz"" = allowed

* ""I have six beautiful 3 year olds as a result of a 12 embryo transfer and they are the light of my life"" = 100% not allowed

<p>Potential Ideas:
*Meet in Central Park/Riverside Park/any NYC Park on a nice day with drinks, apps and just relax/picnic
*Meet at one of the many rooftop bars
*Meet at Le District down in Battery Park and sit outside</p>

<p>Potential Dates:
June 16th, 23rd, 24th, 30th? (All weekend dates). Can also push into July? (I am away at the end of this month otherwise would do it sooner.)
Would anyone be interested in meeting during the week at all?</p>

179,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"This is our story.

I am the husband. I am 39 years old. My wife is 35+ years old. We are from an Indian background.

We got married through an arranged marriage. Even though from outside, it all looked ok; however, inside we both had lots of physical and emotional differences and wants. We have been married ten years now.

Recently, we had the massive fight on whether we should have kids or not.
I wanted. However, she was reluctant.

After a lot of heated arguments, we decided to try. And, she desperately wanted as well.

We tried for about 3+ years at random and sometimes using the timing method with no success.

Then, we went to this IVF Fertility Specialist. Let me call her Dr SM.

On our first IVF cycle, we had two embryos. Both were transferred, and the result was negative.

 On second IVF cycle, we had two embryos again. This time, DR SM also suggested my wife check for Natural Killer Cells (NKC). NKC was found in large numbers than usual. And, hence, she was put on medications/injections for that. We were not told of all the side effects of these medications.

We had one transfer of one embroy. It did not succeed.

Before transferring the second one, my wife and I decided to try out another cycle and leave this one frozen. It was just human feelings. However, our doctor DR SM was very boldly wanted to transfer this rather than starting a new cycle. She said she would like to ""gamble"" with this embryo. And, we allowed that.

During these IVF cycles, PGD/PGS was never done and never suggested by DR SM. :(

We were over the moon when we learnt that it resulted in pregnancy.
NIPT test came out ok.
All scans came out ok; except, the 19th-week scan showed abnormalities in the heart. On the recommendation of the doctor who did the heart scan, we did the amniocentesis. The results of amniocentesis would take some time to arrive. In that meantime, we discussed the condition with DR SM who said it might be Tetralogy of Fallot. However, later we learnt that it was VSD which has very likely chance of closing on its own.



And, the results showed ""terminal deletion within x Chromosome within band p22.33 to p22.2"". Mine and my wife's chromosome karyotypes were done before the IVF cycles, and that was normal. Our doctor DR SM suggested it could be Turner Syndrome.

We discussed the result with genetic counsellors, social worker, the hospital here, cardiologist, surgeons, and more gyno doctors. The genetic counsellors confidently stated that it is not Turner Syndrome. The genes missing would likely cause Microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome. This is a severe developmental disorder. And, my wife and I  could not see our daughter be born with blindness, autism, heart condition, development disorder, mental retardation, infantile seizure,  etc. We took a very difficult decision. A late termination around 22 weeks six days happened with natural birth.  We suffer for this for rest of our lives.

We learnt that if PGD/PGS was done on the embryo or another genetic testing was done around 10/12 week; we would not need to suffer so much.

Do you think our obgyn doctor (Dr SM) was negligent in her duties? I want justice for the sufferings and the pain my wife is going through. Yet, I am never one to complain ever.

We really thought that my SO would have better fertility than I do because of age and family history. It turns out that her situation is far more complex than my ovaries past their prime and a dusty ol' uterus.  

We initially discovered that she had an AFC of 1 as well as a fibroid. This information was complicated when her AMH came back at 2.6. The RE suggested that she pursue a clomid challenge since imaging was difficult with the fibroid blocking the view of her ovary and the clomid challenge would help us learn more about how she might respond to stims. The saline ultrasound showed that she most likely had a unicornuate uterus but the RE couldn't be 100% sure because of the fibroid. She mentioned at that time that she may only have one kidney due to the UU deformity. 

My SO just went in this week to have the initial ultrasound and bloodwork in order to start the clomid challenge. This time, the RE felt that the kidney on the other side was in the wrong place, calling it a ""pelvic kidney."" Because of all of these issues my SO now has to go get a MRI of her abdomen to see what the heck is going on in there. 

In the meantime her labs came back and her calcium level is high. This concerned me immediately because she doesn't take calcium supplements. I googled and the top hit was for hyperparathyroidism. Ok, not good but treatable. Then I started to wonder if her unique anatomy might have something to do with the levels and it turns out that hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) can be associated with kidney defects. Soooooooooo... this is turning out to be quite the rabbit hole, y'all. I'm feeling worried for her because this is a lot of news and given the calcium issues, probably even more poking and prodding is in her future as I'm sure there will be follow ups to figure out why her calcium is high. 

I'm sorta used to the medicalized life after having a chronic illness and now fertility shenanigans. She on the other hand is the type who never goes to the doctor or has health problems. I remember when that was me and how distressing it was when it all changed. This was NOT what we expected when we considered trying reciprocal at ALL (then again, pretty much nothing on this journey has been what we expected). At this point, I think it's pretty clear that reciprocal is probably out at least for a good long while until she sorts out all of these health problems we inadvertently uncovered---not that I even care, I just want her to be ok. I feel sad for her that she has to go through all of this.

That means I'm at least at stage III endo. 

My doctor is suggesting that we go for a lapscropscy with the polyp removal and removal it all (including endometriomas). I was a bit dazed and couldnt process what she said about how to remove it. She said something like using different approaches depending on where the endo is and for cysts a 3 step process that includes draining, removing the wall, and then burning/cauterizing the node? We agreed that at the very least she will look in to stage the endo. I dont have pain concerns with endo, just fertility.

At the same time, I am on the funded IVF wait list with another doctor in about 6 months. What I am concerned about is whether the laparoscopy and removal of the cysts will diminish my ovarian reserve. 8 months ago it was measured at 19.03pmol/l (coverted to 2.6ng/ml by diving by 7.14). That means its already at the lower side of normal and potentially removing the cysts will put me in the DOR category as well.

My options are:
1. Remove all the endo but leave then endometriomas to prevent any injury to my ovarian reserve and proceed with IVF in 6 months. Try NAC for 3 months religiously to see if it decreases the endometriomas.
2. Remove all the endo and the endometrioma cysts and proceed with IVF in 6 months
3. Do not remove the endo, get staged or diagnoses through lapscropscy and proceed to IVF in 6 months.

Please please share your thoughts and recommendations. I need to decide soon as the hospital has to book the appropriate time for May 24th.

<p>My doctor is suggesting that we go for a lapscropscy with the polyp removal and removal it all (including endometriomas). I was a bit dazed and couldnt process what she said about how to remove it. She said something like using different approaches depending on where the endo is and for cysts a 3 step process that includes draining, removing the wall, and then burning/cauterizing the node?

Based on some feedback and with the Reddit redesign, the mods have been doing some updating and wanted to share some rules and thread clarity.

**Rules**

First, the primary rules can always be seen here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/about/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/about/rules).

For folks using the new redesign, you will see the contents of the side bar now \([screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/WIKWhlz)\). For folks using the old design, you will still see the old side bar. Mobile users, you are without a side bar.  Everyone will see the new rules if they report a post/comment.

Discussions of previous loss are always allowed throughout the sub. This is in the sense of ""I've had a miscarriage and it was the hardest thing I've ever been through"" or in intros/flair/medical histories.

Discussion of on\-going miscarriages, D&Cs, waiting for a natural miscarriage can be posted in the main sub/daily threads for support *with a trigger warning*.

We recognize that the first weeks after a positive beta can be anxiety ridden and scary for many. The *post\-beta thread* fills this need, while the *results thread* continues to provide a place for initial results, congratulations, and consolations as needed.

**Results Thread**

The results thread is where your positive beta and/or HPT results go. Negative results can go in the results thread or you can post them in the main sub/daily threads.

The results thread is posted every Sunday. Early in the week the link to the new results thread will be posted in the results link index at the bottom of the ""Read This"" sticky on the top of the page to make it easy to find.

**Post\-Beta Thread**

The post\-beta thread was created after a need was identified for people with positive betas to post if they need support from the community. People posting in this thread may have concerns about betas not rising or dropping \(beta hell/beta limbo\), pregnancies with bleeding, or may be anxious and unready to post in IF babies and need support on an issue. These pregnancies may turn into on\-going, successful pregnancies. It's a safe spot for people to voice their concerns without exposing an on\-going pregnancy to other members who may not be in the right place to see these kinds of updates right now. Those who have the emotional energy to support people in the post\-beta thread can do so. It's stickied for exposure.

Positive updates ARE allowed in the post\-beta thread. For example: if someone's second beta doesn't rise, or drops, and their third beta is okay, an update within the post\-beta thread indicating that all is well, and they have a confirmed positive is okay. This is permitted because people participating in the post\-beta thread do so knowing that they will be discussing positive pregnancy test results and may see early pregnancy issues/concerns.",t2_14rwut,False,,0,False,"Redesign, Rules and Threads Clarity",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8gm1g3,False,dark,0.94,,public,25,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,25,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1525333833.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello Folks!</p>

I'm so annoyed. I'm annoyed at my cycle, which is completely unpredictable. I'm annoyed at my job, which just about every time something big is happening in my life, has something come up and demand its attention instead. I'm annoyed at the fact that I have to do IVF. Having sex is a lot easier (and way more fun) than an FET. It's something I can do while traveling, something I can work into my schedule. And I'm annoyed I'm not a man, who does not even have to deal with this kind of thing! My husband's (physical) part in all of this is already over. He can go to any conference he wants to any time. I'm lucky that he's there for almost every tiny little blood draw, and he'd certainly cancel a conference to accompany me to an FET, but when it comes down to it, he doesn't have to physically be there, especially not if he had a huge career break. 

And rationally, I know, it's about my hormone levels etc and they're not something anyone can control. And when/if I have a baby, it's going to dictate my schedule. But at least then I would *have* a baby. I'm still miffed about everything I went through for my last FET to end in a miscarriage.  

I guess it's just the same old thing... the feeling of having no good choices in this process. I have to give up one thing for the other. Either my career or my life. And I'm not sure I even like my career, but if having kids doesn't happen, which right now I'm kinda afraid of, I don't want to throw away any opportunities. 

I know I can wait another cycle but this stuff just keeps happening. There's always something. I'm so sick of constantly waiting and having almost no control at all.

Rise-big part of this episode featured teen pregnancy and talk of options in terms of abortion/keeping the pregnancy/adoption. Ultrasound also shown.

Avengers Infinity Wars-there was a small part of the movie where Tony Stark told Pepper that he had a dream that she was carrying his baby. Very tiny part of the movie. I feel pretty meh about the movie though, too much CGI, too many characters. 

Married at First Sight-Reunion show this week, talk of pregnancy. 

The Post-I really enjoyed this movie, had a great plot and interesting to follow along with. Meryl Streep was great.

<p>Rise-big part of this episode featured teen pregnancy and talk of options in terms of abortion/keeping the pregnancy/adoption. Ultrasound also shown.</p>

<p>Avengers Infinity Wars-there was a small part of the movie where Tony Stark told Pepper that he had a dream that she was carrying his baby. Very tiny part of the movie. I feel pretty meh about the movie though, too much CGI, too many characters. </p>

For the last 2 weeks (during the stimming monitoring appointments) I've stayed at my parents house, which is only 2 hours away from the IVF clinic to cut my daily driving time to 4 hours instead of 6.

My egg retrieval is tomorrow morning, so today I decided to stay at a hotel next to the clinic to avoid a drive tomorrow.

I texted my spouse asking if he would arrive in time to drive me over to the appointment in the morning, since I'll have taken the prescribed valium an hour prior and can't drive.

He called and irritably told me to just take an uber as he didn't want the pressure of getting there on time. He has to come sometime tomorrow to provide his sperm sample obviously so he'll be there eventually.

I feel really frustrated that he had the nerve to act irritated about me asking for his help. I told him not to bother staying to check on me after the extraction, as I'm pissed off. The hotel is only a block away from the clinic, so I figure I'll walk there and back.

He claims his work is very important and he just can't handle being away/taking time from it.

I feel really upset, but part of me always says...""am I the unreasonable one?"" ""maybe I need to just suck it up and accept that I can make it through this alone"". He just seems so completely unconcerned. What do y'all think?

UPDATE: he made it just in time to pick me up and drive me. We got 12 eggs. All is good except for passing out after it was over from the pain.

Childhood history my parents both were given up to orphanages when they were about two yro, messy...messy divorce (could probably write a book I've been told) when I was 11 yro and my appendix burst inside me when I was 10 yro. First time we went to the hospital, the doctors told my parents to take me home that I was probably just starting my period...fast forward to my appendix bursting and appx 20 years later it bursting is a big reason for my infertility now. 

I'll be 32 yro this August, been ttc for almost 3 years, PCOS, laparoscopic surgery March 2017, salpingectomy April 2017, male infertility (abnormal morphology but his quantity is ten times the norm yay go hubby!), female infertility and two rounds of failed IUI's. We're the oldest of both our families we've had to do everything on our own, paving our own paths with no guidance related to jobs, cell phones, paying for college...ugh so much debt, house, you name it. Never asked our families for a dime all we've ever wanted is their emotional support. BUT that's too much to ask of them though. We've told them our next step is IVF and will be applying for grants for it. Worst case scenario we go into more debt to do IVF :( Seriously, I cannot fathom, if the roles were reversed, having a child going through infertility and avoiding the subject matter with them altogether like our families to do us. Please know we enjoy life and are not thr type of people that bring this up all the time. Howver, the occasional call/text asking how we're doing would be nice. Whenever I do bring it up, they shut me down, don't let me emote, change the subject or say ""well I think you should just hurry up and adopt"".

MIL is a hoarder, monster-in-law, crazy cat lady, my biological mom is a drug addict and the rest of my family apparently has varying degrees of narassictic personality disorders and regardless of what I do, say, how much I SHOW them I love them..they will never love me the way they should because they lack empathy and compassion according to my therapist. I haven't had grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins etc in my life because my parents were in and out of foster homes for so long. It's been and continues to be a lonely isolating crazy life I lead...hubby and I just want this pain to stop and a family of our own. Blah!

I noticed that many of you don't have the most emotionally supportive families. I really think some of you could use a new mom! I think I could be a really great mom so let's make this happen!!!!!

Here is my offer:

Do you want a new mom who is much more empathetic about your situation? Because I have decided to solve my infertility problems through adoption and well, what the hell, why not you? I need a baby. You need a mom who isn't being a fucking idiot about the problems in your life.

I want you to understand that this isn't going to be all Disney vacations. You will be expected to earn your allowance. You will being helping your father mow the lawn. Picking the new dandelions will be your job spring through autumn. Luckily for you, we manually removed them the last few years so not many come up any more. Well, that is not all inclusive but you get the idea.

I am sorry but we spent all our savings on ivf so you are going to have to pay for college on your own or get scholarships. If you go to a local state college, you can live at home for free but no boys spending the night, home by midnight, and the chores are still included.

I am so excited about this! Everybody is right! Once I made the decision to be happy about adopting, it IS the same! I just CAN'T WAIT to pick your new clothes out. I hope you like Star Trek because I have been planning to dress you up like Captain Kirk for Halloween.

Edit: Don't be offended if I don't respond to everybody individually. My inbox has been flooded with like two people who want me to be their mom so I am a little overwhelmed.

There may be a lot of triggering stuff in here so tread carefully, but I'm sharing because my life has a lot of triggers \(living child\) that I need to vent about.  I just need to share some thoughts that I can't share elsewhere. I have some private pain that I can't even share with my husband. Please please proceed with caution and let me know if this is out of line.      

I know living children is a touchy subject, believe me, I know. I have a stepdaughter so my own husband has a 10 year old child. Stepparenting is it's own trigger\-word minefield on both sides and prone to making me feel guilty about my totally normal feelings, so joy, I got that going for me too. Sometimes I feel as though the insensitivity about infertility is in my own home and we are very much not on the same page.      

My husband tends to give my stepdaughter a call right after we have an emotional talk about infertility/trying/seeking help. I'm not going to tell him not to do that but it hurts because after talking to her he will tell me about her recent accomplishments with pride. It feels like he is rubbing his parenthood in my face. It undoes the discussion and changes it back from ""we"" to ""me"" really quick with that reminder that yes his sperm indeed works. He has a kid that was unplanned so ""trying"" is a new concept.  I have let him know that being a part time parent is not going to fill the hole in me due to the limited time we have her and my lack of influence on her life. I think being a part time parent is somewhat of an emotial hole for him and he does want to have more kids.

But I hold back losing my shit on my husband sometimes. Yesterday I had a cry in the shower when what I really wanted to do was rage and throw a pillow at him and scream ""You don't have a vagina, your reproductive organs do what they're supposed to do and you have a kid! You don't understand!"" I haven't started treatment yet but I'm worried I will lose my filter if I'm on drugs that manipulate my hormones. I hope being upset early in the game like this is ok for this sub. We have been trying for ""only"" 9 months, but I have not been able to confirm ovulation during this time and my cycles keep getting longer and longer. Something is not right and I'm going to the RE this month to figure it out. I think this recent freakout is because I made an appointment and shit is getting real.      

My stepdaughter has also started asking tons of questions and making up memories from when she was a baby. Sometimes it gets really hard when we are together to play like we are a happy family when she is asking about all these things I wasn't there for. I have a bunch of pregnant/new mom friends and coworkers so much of my interactions with people are holding in my own pained feelings. I once asked my husband if he could love an adopted kid as much as his daughter and he said he didn't think so. I'm glad he was honest but that took adoption off the table for me, It wouldn't be fair to the kid. He very much wants more biological kids so I feel the pressure of disappointing him. 

My partner is supposed to be who I lean on during this and I feel like we are in very different places. He doesn't have that urge the same way I do because though he wants more kids if we never conceive he said it's ok with him if we do or don't. I'm really considering couples counseling to go alongside treatment.      

Does anyone have any advice on getting on the same page as your partner? I imagine it takes a while and a lot of talking before you can be at the same place. What was the process like for you? Did you have any fundamental differences like this that made it harder? Did you freak out more at the start but were able to calm down once a plan was made and you found out what was going on?

Quick background:
35 (36 in a month), haven’t been on birth control since I was 23, never been pregnant. 3 rounds of IUIs with femera days 3-7 and ovidrel trigger, all negative. First round of IVF was converted to an IUI (today). I’m DOR. I’m on 225 of gonal-f and 150 of menopur. 

I talked to the doctor today. We are doing IUI on Thursday this week (the day I would have been doing retrieval). I only had 2 follicles. As of today one is at 15 and the other at 17. My retrieval was canceled because I only ended up with the two follicles and they like to see at least 4. When the doctor called he said do the IUI and if it doesn’t work then call on cycle day 1.  (The way he said it made me think he didn’t think it would work. I’ve had 3 and none have worked. I may be reading too much into this but I’m upset so it’s hard not to).  

My question is when you don’t respond to the meds what usually happens? Do they usually raise the dosage? Have you stim longer? Try different meds? When I talked to him today he said he’s hoping that doing meds back to back will make me more likely to respond the next time. It sounded like to me that he was planning on doing the exact same meds and dosages I tried this time. He said if it doesn’t work again that we will sit down and talk. But shouldn’t we do that this time? 

I don’t know cause I don’t know what’s normal. (I know everyone is different so there really isn’t a “normal”). We have enough money to do meds one more time and that’s it.

I don't ovulate. I've never had a predictable cycle in my life. I was on birth control for 10 years prior to our first attempt. I've since been told I have PCOS by my RE. 

I took clomid a few years (2013) back (at age 28)and the first cycle was immediately successful. Fast forward a couple of years and we decide to try again. Clomid at max dose triggers horrible daily migraines. I'm referred to RE.

June 2016 RE recommended Femara and timed intercourse with ultrasound and hcg trigger. Ok. We do this for a few months. Pregnant December 2016.

January 2017 Miscarriage at 12 weeks.

March 2017 back to Femara and trigger for a couple of months. No dice.

July and August 2017 (and there's one more but don't remember date) Femara, trigger, and IUI. Nothing.

3 more cycles Femara and trigger. Nothing.

Took a break from treatment December to April. During this time I've lost some weight, and was hopeful that the break would help my body do... I don't know, something.

April 2018: Femara, trigger, and timed intercourse. Started my period today. 

RE says next step is stronger ovulation drugs in lieu of Femara. We're not going to IVF, as it was a struggle to get my husband on board for IUI. 

I am now 33 (almost 34). I've had HSG, hormone levels, and ovarian reserve tested and all came back fine. My ovaries are not cystic. I am being treated for hypothyroidism (50mg generic synthroid) which I wasn't for my first round of treatment in 2013.

I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm looking for some direction, and a sympathetic ear (eye?) that won't tell me useless platitudes. If I hear ""it's not God's will right now"" one more time I might throat punch someone.

253,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"A recent large-scale study has indicated that high levels of air pollution could reduce the chance of pregnancy following fertility treatment.

Women exposed to increased concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ambient particulate matter had a lower rate of conception following fertility treatment and a higher chance of early pregnancy loss compared with women exposed to lower concentrations of these pollutants.

Researchers at the CHA University School of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea, investigated whether the concentration of five common air pollutants affected the outcome of over 6600 treatment cycles performed at the CHA fertility centre between 2006 and 2014. Using data from 40 air-quality monitoring sites across Seoul, the average daily concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10µm), were calculated for each city district over the nine-year study period. 

Individual exposures were estimated for each participant based on their residential address at the time of their fertility treatment. The investigators analysed pollutant exposure levels for each participant over four different time periods: at the start of controlled ovarian stimulation to oocyte retrieval; oocyte retrieval to embryo transfer; embryo transfer to pregnancy test; and the start of controlled ovarian stimulation to pregnancy test.

Fertility outcomes were not affected by the exposure levels of sulphur dioxide and ozone. In contrast, exposure to increased levels of nitrogen dioxide or carbon monoxide during controlled ovarian stimulation was associated with a reduced chance of conception.

In addition, increased exposure to nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide or PM10 following the embryo transfer was associated with a lower chance of treatment success. For those women that did achieve a positive pregnancy test following treatment, increased exposure to nitrogen dioxide or PM10 post-embryo transfer increased the risk of an early pregnancy loss.

The study, published in Human Reproduction, joins a growing body of evidence that suggests air pollution can have a negative impact on fertility (see BioNews 928).

While its findings may help to improve understanding of the conception process, it may be of limited practical application for those individuals undergoing fertility treatment. In a conversation with Reuters, Dr Lyndsey Darrow, an environmental epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, acknowledged that measures to reduce outdoor air pollution will require considerable public investment.

She said: 'Ultimately there is a limit to how much individuals can control their own air pollution exposures. Outdoor pollution is one of those problems we can only address through collective action.'

I'm trying to find out if there are differences between primary ovarian insufficiency and endo-caused diminished ovarian reserve.

The story is my FSH just came back at 14, a month after getting an endo/adeno/blocked tube diagnosis. Everything I've read so far says this is the cutoff where doctors start suggesting donor eggs instead of own eggs. My E2 also came back as 21, and lower seemed good at first but then I read this is too low and is the estradiol level of menopausal women. 

My doctor suspected this was the case, that I would have damaged ovarian reserve (she already knew my antral follicle count was low). But I'm not sure if having a high FSH at 30 years old means I'm peri-menopausal (or will be before 40), and all that comes with it (like needing hormone replacement therapy to prevent osteoporosis, and scarily, parkinsons/dementia later on). Or, if because my FSH is caused by endo, it functions differently somehow and I won't need HRT? Maybe a lap would put FSH back to normal?

I've read through protocols of women with DOR and many do mini-IVF or natural-IVF, since they don't respond to meds; if my DOR is endo-caused, does that change the protocol at all or should it be the same, would you think? And is the donor egg recommendation still in place?

I track my BBT, and as of this morning my chart is now giving me crosshairs and saying I ovulated 5 days ago... I always have a slow rise so that is normal for me, but the temps/coverline *are* a bit lower than my past cycles, and I have never ovulated so early in my cycle before. [Chart here](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/druzymom/)

My questions:

I had a blood draw to check my hormones last weekend (four days before possible ovulation) and my RE said I could start the pill whenever because my cycle is so long usually, over 100-200 days. Would an upcoming ovulation show in the bloodwork, four days out?

Does the pill mess with my BBT so quickly, since I only took it yesterday afternoon? If I have actually ovulated, is it okay to keep taking the pill? Will my temps remain high because of the pill and not because I may have ovulated...?

I had my DOR (FSH 14, AFC 15, AMH 1.3) diagnosis confirmed this week after my first retrieval yielded 5/14 mature eggs. My RE says that other than taking a prenatal there's not much I can do lifestyle wise and he's still giving us a 50% chance with each transfer, even though our remaining embryo is 4BC. I'm worried he's just giving us generic advice. I've tried reading a few papers on pubmed and the evidence seems mixed. I'm taking 200mg DHEA (edit DHA) daily anyway. The AMAs this week seemed mixed on this. I'd love to think that Dr Aimee's recommendations would help but it feels silly to go against my RE's advice. I've got a FET coming up but after my first failed transfer I've been losing hope and am thinking that another retrieval is likely.

My RE says that other than taking a prenatal there&#39;s not much I can do lifestyle wise and he&#39;s still giving us a 50% chance with each transfer, even though our remaining embryo is 4BC. I&#39;m worried he&#39;s just giving us generic advice. I&#39;ve tried reading a few papers on pubmed and the evidence seems mixed. I&#39;m taking 200mg DHEA (edit DHA) daily anyway. The AMAs this week seemed mixed on this. I&#39;d love to think that Dr Aimee&#39;s recommendations would help but it feels silly to go against my RE&#39;s advice. I&#39;ve got a FET coming up but after my first failed transfer I&#39;ve been losing hope and am thinking that another retrieval is likely. Should I be doing everything even remotely possible to help those future eggs or should I just follow my RE&#39;s advice? </p>

I'm getting ready to start my third antagonist cycle with estrogen priming. Generally, the way this has worked is that I come in for an ovulation check between days 14-18 (Ultrasound & Blood). Once they've confirmed ovulation and my P2 levels are above 2, they start me on estrogen patches and Ganirelix. Last round, I ovulated really late (day 21 out of what became a normal 28 day cycle; by then my P2 levels were over 3). So basically, I had a really long follicular phase, very short luteal phase. My clinic ended up bringing me back 3 times before giving me the go-ahead to start priming.

This time, I came in on Day 18. P2 was only 1.4 and the u/s confirmed I still had an egg growing. So far, not too surprising. I came back 4 days later for just blood work and my P2 had dropped to 1.

Hi again. I was here for a bit back in the fall after my husband and I were told we’d likely require IVF/ICSI due to MFI. The rest of our fertility workup actually ended up being normal, and even my husband’s third semen analysis ended up being quasi-normal (low-normal count but only 1% morphology). So, our doctor recommended we try naturally for a few more months before launching in to IVF. We did, and miraculously, got pregnant. The 4 months I was pregnant were the happiest time in my life. And then a routine ultrasound showed significant abnormalities, our daughter was diagnosed with Trisomy 18, and we lost her.

So now I’m back. Even friends and family who know that we struggled to conceive are *so confident* that the fact we got pregnant once means we’ll easily get pregnant again and have a healthy child soon. Obviously, the fact that we got pregnant once is extremely encouraging, and I am so grateful to have had the experience of getting two lines on a home pregnancy test and feeling pregnant even for just a short time. I know so many here aren’t so lucky, and I hesitated even to post here again because I almost feel ashamed complaining to all of you.

Trisomy 18 is a rare, random chromosomal abnormality due to an error in cell division early in the embryo’s life. Sometimes it can be hereditary if one parent has a balanced translocation, but that is not the case for us. Typically, non-hereditary forms of T18 are not thought to be directly related to medical issues resulting in infertility or subfertility, and yet aneuploidies like T18 do become more likely as women age, so it’s not *entirely* random. I’m 30 and had a normal AMH, follicle count, etc, so my eggs are probably (although not certainly) okay. My husband’s urologist was unconcerned about his low morphology (he thinks the criteria are way too strict, rendering the measurement meaningless—and he also said the lab would have commented on any abnormalities severe enough to be concerning). But I can’t help but wonder if there might be some connection to our daughter’s diagnosis. Has anyone here been told anything or read anything regarding low sperm morphology and risk of aneuploidy? On a quick pubmed search, I didn’t find anything compelling except in the case of couples with recurrent losses or IVF failures (which isn’t us, yet).

Thank you for being such a wonderful community. I got so much support here last year. I’m not sure how I would have dealt with all of that without this place.

The details of the group can be found on the Resolve page where you can search for support (location, date/time).  My contact info can also be found.

Silicon Valley-no triggers just funny

Nate and Jeremiah by design-mention of a complication with their surrogate and how she needs surgery. It ends up being fine.

Westworld is back!! I haven't watched it yet :( But heard there might be triggers.

Grey's-Looking forward to their take on the #metoo stuff this week.

I'm new to reddit so forgive me for any non traditional asks.

We have gone through 1 cycle of meds.
1st cycle was:
450 Gonal F with 3 vials of Menopure and then cetrotide was added in and finally an HCG shot.  The RE said they were disappointed in how I was responding and they had to add on days.  We did a total of 13 days before the transfer.  On day 10 they told me that I would have to do a freeze all b/c my estrogen was too high and it would make issues with my lining (which was perfect) and the embryo wouldn't implant.  

They did get 8 eggs and 1 cyst at the transfer.  (I have one ovary from stage 4 endo which removed a 13 inch chocolate cyst, my left ovary and tube when I was 21).  1 made it through the night but didn't make it to day 5. 

So here we are about to start over.....
This time they put me on metformin, coQ10 (200 mg 3 times/day) dhea (25mg 3 times/day).  They're starting me on estrace on monday the 30th and I shoudl get AF a week later.  At this pace my transfer would be at the end of May (with hopes it turns out better).  They have already told me we have to do a freeze all b/c i will most likely hyperstimmulate again.  

My question is that are there any studies on if it's better to do the frozen transfer immediately the month after or if it is better to wait a month and then do the transfer?

**Who Is Nick Stretchbery… And what is Business Intelligence?** 

Nick is the Business Intelligence Manger at Fertility Centers of Illinois, a fertility clinic based in Chicago and the Chicagoland suburbs. FCI is an 11 physician practice with two IVF labs, one downtown and one in Highland Park, IL, plus nine clinics ranging from Buffalo Grove to Warrenville to Tinley Park. Each visit at every one of those clinics creates an immense amount of information, from lab results to insurance claims and processing, that all needs to be organized, analyzed, and optimized. Enter: Business Intelligence. Nick and his team works with every department to ensure that patient data is properly cared for and analyzed to provide the best patient experience possible. There are a million different moving pieces within a clinic of FCI’s size, and Business Intelligence helps to ensure we’re all on the same page. They’re the nerds of the organization.

Nick and his wife are also patients of FCI, going through a six failed IUIs, a couple IVF cycles and a couple of FETs, one of which has been successful. So he knows both sides of the coin in the infertility world. 

**AMA Focus of Discussion:**

Take it where you want! He’ll talk about anything you ask – insurance questions, what it’s like to go through treatment \(or, rather, what it’s like to watch someone you love go through treatment\), navigating all of the ins\-and\-outs of the treatment process, interesting behind the scenes tidbits\* – so come with everything you’ve ever been curious about. If he can’t answer something, he’ll definitely find someone who can. 

*\*As a rule, Fertility Centers of Illinois takes private health information VERY seriously. So feel free to ask anything, but it’s definitely preferred that you don’t ask super personal or identifying questions. No one wants to violate HIPAA. FCI is also not able to give you medical advice except in broad generalities without treating you as a patient. So definitely follow up anything that you are concerned with your OB/GYN, GP, or RE.* ",t2_184x7w4z,False,,0,False,"Hi, I'm Nick and I am the Business Intelligence Manager (and Patient!) at Fertility Centers of Illinois, Ask Me Anything!",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8em3qh,False,dark,0.89,,public,25,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},NIAW AMA Event,False,25,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1524618777.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi!

He’ll talk about anything you ask – insurance questions, what it’s like to go through treatment (or, rather, what it’s like to watch someone you love go through treatment), navigating all of the ins-and-outs of the treatment process, interesting behind the scenes tidbits* – so come with everything you’ve ever been curious about. If he can’t answer something, he’ll definitely find someone who can. </p>

<p><em>\</em>As a rule, Fertility Centers of Illinois takes private health information VERY seriously. So feel free to ask anything, but it’s definitely preferred that you don’t ask super personal or identifying questions. No one wants to violate HIPAA. FCI is also not able to give you medical advice except in broad generalities without treating you as a patient. So definitely follow up anything that you are concerned with your OB/GYN, GP, or RE.* </p>

So a few months back I posted on the horrifying (for me) experience surrounding how some ""close"" friends decided to tell us their happy news. (We were trapped in their house, after acting like they weren't trying for a baby, adding how scared they had been after only 4 months of trying)

A week later, the husband then proceeds to go off on me, telling me how I should be happy for them, how, if he had been in my shoes, he wouldn't have listened to my Doctor's advice like I did and got answers faster. How we aren't actually infertile because there is still hope via science. 

In the end, he relented, purchased us a damn expensive BBQ, and started giving us some empathy. 

Anyway. He texted my hubby telling him they were in the hospital. On April 20th, she had given birth to a little girl. 

It's been 4 days now and we still haven't visited. I'm wondering how long we can stretch this out before having to marvel at their success?

The good news is, we are on the waiting list for government funded IVF - in September. 

The baby looks cute in the pictures. But, I dread having to sit there, like I have many, many times previously, while they ooh and aw at their baby. While they discuss the birth. I feel like I'll be both bored out of my mind and tired of seeing what I can't achieve while seemingly everyone can. 

I do love babies. But I feel like, because of how this entire thing started, their baby's existence is somewhat tarnished for me. Obviously, the baby isn't at fault. But I feel more indifference than happiness this time. Too many babies, two many tears, it's been a bit much.

It seems that we have had another big turnover of users here in r/infertility. We are always glad to see members graduate, and to welcome new users in to the fold. However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.

If you haven't already, please read our sidebar and/or the sticky post listing our rules.

**Mention of pregnancy/ positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread.**

Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C"". **Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules.** This is to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Sometimes mentions of children/pregnancy is painful. **Unsolicited mentions does include flair** - a reminder to keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality.

Unfortunately I feel the same feelings as my last two IVFs...right after the transfer I feel like my pelvic area is inflamed - it is bloated and there is a burning sensation.

I'm PrestigeWombat and like many of you here... my story is pretty freaking sucky. 

Our journey started when I was the ripe age of 23. I immediately started tracking as soon as my husband and I started trying to conceive. After 3 months we had a success but sadly miscarried at 7 weeks. We kept moving forward. At 9 months I started getting concerned and bought the clear blue digital fertility monitor. After 3 months of using that and nothing I decided to see a doctor. After months of testing from both my husband and I (blood work, ultrasounds, and hsg) I was diagnosed with unexplained infertility. I than began clomid at cycle/month 18. This did result in a success in that sense. 

TRIGGER WARNING: MENTION OF CHILD 

We learned at our child's 3rd day of life that she has an extremely rare genetic condition that's not normally tested for and she will not live beyond 6 months to a year of life. 


Thus our journey into IVF is where we will possibly step next. I don't know where I belong because my situation is incredibly unique. However, to have our own biological offspring we cannot do that without IVF and PGS. As each pregnancy has a 25% chance of being an affected pregnancy and 50% being a carrier. So I'm hoping if we do in fact choose to go that route you will have me here.
