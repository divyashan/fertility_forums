My husband got his SA results back about a month ago. They showed very low count, not great progression or motility. His T levels were also found to be on the low side. 
Dr. Prescribed him Clomid for one month and asked to do a repeat SA in a month. Clomid is known to help sperm quality and levels, as well as T levels in Men.
This lovely group helped me to understand that that didn't make total sense, and we should wait to test in 3 months. 

We FINALLY got a hold of the urologist who agreed to refill the Clomid and wait for three months to retest. 
Since then, I've seen my doctor who was only as helpful as she could be. She did give me referrals to RE and to the fertility clinics in the area. 

Now here is my where to next?

SO I looked up the fertility clinics. Most of the ones in the area will not see you unless you have seen an RE first. However, I did get a referral straight from my doctor, not sure if that helps. 
We do not have a reproductive urologist in the area. We only have one RE and about 4 fertility clinics. 

My question is should we just go to the regular urologist for the repeat SA and see what they suggest, or should we attempt to just bypass that (Since they aren't insanely helpful and don't specialize in reproductive health) and go straight to an RE or the clinics?

Current issue: back in high school, I had cramps and period pain so intense that I was tentatively diagnosed with endometriosis and put on birth control. About 10 years later, I stopped taking the pill and discovered my endometriosis symptoms were all but gone.

But ever since the egg retrieval, my cramps and pelvic pain have come back with a vengeance. In the middle of all this my husband and I moved for job purposes, so I mentioned it to my new OBGYN and she said she didn’t see any way the egg retrieval could have an impact on endo. But how much of a coincidence is it that it lay dormant for 6 years and then MAGICALLY reappeared the month after my surgery? My new RE put me on a low dose bc and hopefully that will work.

I’m most pissed because we wouldn’t have done egg retrieval if we’d known my husband has no viable sperm. So now I feel as if I’ve thrown a lit match onto my OWN fertility.

Has anyone experienced or read anything about egg retrieval exacerbating endometriosis? Every time I try to look it up all I find is stuff going the other way - how endo may lead to IVF treatments.

<p>Any tricks?</p>

86,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone (cross posted to /maleinfertility,

My husband has diagnosed with extremely low sperm count (less than 500,000 total) about 3 years ago. The urologist could find no reason at all after a physical and hormonal workup. We conceived our son with ICSI. Our recent FET failed and we planned to do another fresh IVF this month. Had an analysis this summer and it was similar to when we conceived, low but not 0. However, he was tested last week and his count was 0. He has not been taking great care of himself, but he's average weight, eats fairly well, drinks socially and isn't doing much different than he was this summer. He's going to see another urologist this week. In addition to all this, his father has aggressive prostate cancer and just tested positive for the BRCA2 gene. So, I have many questions:

1. Anyone been in this situation with a very low count that went to 0? Did it recover? Is it worth waiting 3 months (or more? how long?) to see if he can recover some count for ICSI?
2. What's the very best reading on wrapping your head around sperm donation? (mTESE is not very appealing to us, the low chance of pregnancy doesn't seem worth the risk, but curious on other's thoughts here.)
3. I found one study linking BRCA2 gene with azoospermia. Does anyone know more about this, or in a similar situation?
4. If we can do ICSI again are we at great risk of passing on genetic abnormalities to our kid? (My understanding is if azoospermia is not obstructive or hormonal, it's often genetic.) Did we already likely pass something onto our son?
5. Any other thoughts or tips you have for us would be appreciated. Thank you!

I was initially told that it would start covering IVF with at $25K lifetime cap in January.  Now I'm being told July, but I am worried that it could be pushed back again.  I basically arranged my entire schedule around starting the process this cycle, but if I move forward, it will be out of pocket.  I have been crying off and on since yesterday morning when I learned that insurance fell through.  The anticipation of IVF was basically what got me through the holidays after my MC right before Thanksgiving.  Just to add to all of this, one of my coworkers announced her pregnancy on Christmas, and she is due right around when I would have been, and I am now having to leave the room to pull myself together anytime somebody asks her about how far along she is, etc.  Every time it comes up, I just keep thinking ""That was supposed to be me!"" and I just don't think I can mentally/emotionally handle watching her go through her entire pregnancy and have a baby in July while I am twiddling my thumbs and constantly hoping and praying that I can actually start the IVF that month without insurance fucking me over again.  I need to feel like I'm doing something to work towards the goal.  I think that having some embryos frozen, even if I don't use them right away, will be a huge relief.

&#x200B;

There is good news.  My parents are willing to cover the cost until my insurance finally gets their act together, and I recognize that I am very VERY lucky to have parents who are able and willing to do this.  As of now, the plan is to go ahead with the egg retrieval and fresh transfer, and then if it doesn't take and I need to to frozen transfers, I will wait until July to start that.  At the same time, I also feel a little bad that all this money would be spent when it will be covered if I just had the emotional strength to wait 6 months.  I seriously wish I just had the option of cryogenically freezing myself until July.  I am trying to mentally work around my feelings about accepting their help.  

&#x200B;

First of all, despite how much my parents say that its a gift, I will definitely consider it an interest free loan and pay them back over time.  Still, that would be a lot of money that theoretically doesn't have to be spent at all.  One of my thought processes is this: since insurance won't cover anything past $25K, I will probably have to eventually pay out of pocket anyway.  Maybe not with baby #1 \*knocks on wood\*, but with baby #2 or #3 (I do plan on staying with this company long term, so I will still have the same insurance).  If I have to have another egg retrieval down the line, then I should hit the $25K mark easily, and then I can feel like paying out of pocket for the first egg retrieval was less of a big deal, because that money was always going to be spent at some point.  I know that there is a chance that I could also be very lucky and get a bunch of good embryos now and then have each one of my kids after only 1 transfer and never need another egg retrieval.  That would definitely be a great ""problem"" to have, and then future me will just have to deal with the knowledge that we spent a crap ton of money for no reason.

121,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, this is my first post. I’m 30 and have been trying to have a baby for about two years. After fertility treatments in the spring, my husband and I had a miscarriage in August at 8 weeks. We then moved on to IVF - I finished my egg retrieval in November and am waiting to transfer in the next few months. 

After my egg retrieval I was feeling like I was in a good place especially since my miscarriage took a major toll on my emotions, I still grieve but I know there is hope. Shortly after my miscarriage my two sister-in-laws on my husband’s side of the family announced their pregnancies, they are both considerably younger than me and it’s especially hard for my husband to see his younger siblings build their families. 

It was very hard to cope with the announcements but no one knows that since I am very loving and supportive. At family events I make sure I check in on them and ask about their appointments and how things are progressing - even when it pains me to do so. 

This Christmas hit me very hard, it was like the most ultimate emotional trigger. Attending extended family gatherings with them was horrible - listening to all the great aunts and uncles get excited, and obviously wondering why my husband and I aren’t expecting yet...

On Christmas Day we all opened our gifts as a family and I was not expecting it to be a mini baby shower, they were exchanging baby onesies in front of me, it was very hard. Then the ultimate - my mother-in-law knit the most stunning and intricate baby blanket and gifted it to one of them. I watched as they opened it and I almost fell apart. She knit something for me too, a neck warmer :/ 

I am not a selfish person, I have always been very loving and supportive but for the first time I feel conflicted for being so upset during such a happy time. I cried for three nights straight and really felt the grief of my miscarriage mixed with the isolation of my infertility. I know that one day my mother-in-law will knit something special if I have a baby, I just thought that I deserved a bit more consideration. They all know what I’ve been through this past year but I guess it goes to show that people do not understand the heartache of infertility. 

How do I let them know these feelings? How do I let anyone know about the struggles I feel everyday. It’s truly isolating :(

125,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I’ve had weird on/off cramping throughout my cycle in different areas for the last 6 months or so. I was starting to think it was treatment related, but it’s continued this past month when I’ve been completely off tx. It’s most often in my lower pelvis to the left or right, or around my right ovary. I’m starting to suspect this might be endo-related, and would love to have some of you wonderful experts weigh in here: 

* Does this look worth pursuing an endo diagnosis?
* If so, what do you recommend?
* If not, any ideas on what else could be causing the cramping?

We’re just starting suppression phase of IVF #1 with an antagonist protocol with a freeze-all for PGS testing. I don’t want to change anything for this IVF (1. not to delay, 2. will inform us about something), but I do wonder if this might affect FET. I want to avoid a diagnostic lap unless IVF #1 numbers suggest it’s necessary, but if this looks like endo, maybe do Receptiva and depot lupron before attempting transfers (depending on how the Hunger Games go). Other thoughts/suggestions welcome!   


Possible symptoms/history:

* I had very heavy, long periods as a teenager (though not so bad I had to miss school or sports)
* I just found out from my mom that my maternal grandmother had a hysterectomy in her late 30s/early 40s due to extremely heavy periods (no idea about pain level, unfortunately); my mom has no endo-like history and started menopause around 45, I have no sisters. Same grandmother was diabetic. 
* Inconclusive finding of endometrioma on right ovary on MRI (MRI was to see whether I had septated uterus after SIS from hell); RE dismissed as dye from HSG test the day before
* HSG showed inconclusive left tube patency: the dye went most of the way but we couldn’t see it spill out because the tube was blocked by my uterus in the foreground so you can't see it on x-ray (but, could there be endo towards the end of the tube?)
* I’ve always had moderate to heavy cramping, but nothing that has prevented me from going to work. I noticed cramps were better on the cycles with progesterone support. 
* Very short luteal phase (7-10 days); cycles are 23-31 days, vary by about 3-4 days each time. 
* I recently cut out soy and gluten. I seem to be responding well, and just learned this is part of an endo diet. I think I have some FODMAPs issues as well, working on that (and already lactose intolerant). Lots of bloating, but the diet changes are helping with this. 
* I have never had a positive pregnancy test (no MFI).
* Have not had blood progesterone measured but I clearly have a progesterone issue with my short LP (progestorone suppositories got my LP to 12 days)
* Maybe some pain with bowel movements around periods (I haven’t been tracking this so I’m not sure whether the timing coincides)
* Very retroverted uterus

But, other symptoms don’t line up with an endo dx:

* I have very light, short periods (light/medium flow 2 days, maybe 1 more day very light flow, then a few days of spotting). They got a lot lighter in my 20s, then I had Mirena/Skyla for 8 years (no period 1.5 years, then light period). Still light after getting IUD removed in 2016.  
* Normal CD3 estradiol (35 pg/ml)
* Normal AMH (4.0), FSH (7.9), and TSH (1.59); none of the immune biomarkers discussed by Dr. Braverman. No history of thyroid issues or other autoimmune issues. Normal BMI. 
* No urinary issues or painful sex (at least none outside that associated with my extra-retroflexed uterus)

What else might be causing cramping throughout my cycle? No cysts for 2/3 letrozole cycles; no cysts on diagnostic ultrasounds; one letrozole cycle CD3 I had a 13.5 mm cyst, but my estradiol was normal so they let me proceed with the next cycle. Maybe it’s just unrelated dietary issues? But the cramping feels very different than GI cramping.

He has low sperm/poor morphology and I have endo. We adopted our son, who just turned 3, after the first few years of infertility. After his adoption, we didn’t plan to revisit fertility treatments. But I am realizing now that I still have a strong desire to experience pregnancy and that we’d really like for him to have a sibling. So, we’re exploring our options again and embryo adoption appeals to me for a couple reasons:
- it’s less invasive than traditional IVF
- it’s cheaper than traditional IVF
- I worry about how my son will feel about having a sibling that is genetically linked to his parents (when he, oviously, is not), which embryo adoption circumvents 

Because of this, we are pretty confident that we want to do embryo adoption through Shady Grove. However, everyone (our doctors, our family) is acting like we are insane for not trying “regular” IVF first with our own sperm and eggs.

They had me do two more days of 150iu and come back today, and I have just one 13mm follicle. 

I also have been on estradiol CD 8 on, just 2mg once a day. I cut it down to 1mg on my own after the CD 12 US. Now my RE wants me to come back in two days and cut the estradiol to 1 mg not knowing I already fucking did that.

This was my first round of clomid and Gonal F. I did 100mg clomid 3-7, 150iu gonal f CD 8, 75iu CD 9-10, 25 CD 11. Ultrasound on CD 12 showed a 12mm follicle on my right. They had me do two more days of 150iu and come back today, and I have just one 13mm follicle. </p>

<p>I also have been on estradiol CD 8 on, just 2mg once a day. I cut it down to 1mg on my own after the CD 12 US. Now my RE wants me to come back in two days and cut the estradiol to 1 mg not knowing I already fucking did that. </p>

<p>What the hell is going on? Every time I get hope for a cycle it gets crushed. My lining was 8mm CD 12, and today it was only 6. I don&#39;t know what to even do with myself right now I&#39;m taking this harder than I should but this is bullshit. I have no gonal f and they don&#39;t want me doing anymore this cycle because obviously it&#39;s a waste, so I&#39;m supposed to waste two days doing more fucking estradiol and then go back in just to be told I still haven&#39;t responded? Before this I did a round of clomid that produced a 24mm and I triggered CD 16 but my lining was only 5mm. The next cycle I did was where we added estradiol, 2mg orally. My lining was still only a 5 on CD 12, and I had an 11mm and a 12mm, but I also had a 24mm that I knew was a cyst but I didn&#39;t have a baseline and refused to waste a trigger shot so the cycle was canceled. I stopped taking the estradiol and ovulated on my own exactly a week later, CD 19. Now this cycle. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t respond to letrozole, and I did a bunch of rounds of clomid unmonitored. I&#39;m unexplained. I&#39;m at a loss and don&#39;t know what to do from here. Should I keep taking the estradiol? If 300iu gonal f didn&#39;t work the past two days, there definitely won&#39;t be anything in two more days with no meds at all except more estradiol. </p>

I know they don’t owe me a dime and I’m grateful for everything they’ve given me in life. \n\nI have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. My sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and I’m happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. Now it’s my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. \n\nMy sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. She didn’t have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. My sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they’re great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. \n\nI know I sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. There was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. I knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn’t want to have an infant at that age. In my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. I don’t blame her for being scared. I would have been terrified to. \n\nBut I’m still upset that now I won’t be able to have much of a wedding because I had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. I’m not so much upset that they gave it to her, but I am upset that they gave it to her *knowing* nothing would ever come of it. That they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. My sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. \n\nWhen my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. I couldn’t hide my disappointment. I really tried to reassure them that I understood, but they could tell I was hurt. My sister called later and told me that it sucks I can’t have a ‘fancy wedding’ (like hers) but basically I need to grow up. Which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. She said she’s sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as I’d hoped. \n\nI know this isn’t the end of the world. This is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and I feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. I’m still getting married.

I know they don’t owe me a dime and I’m grateful for everything they’ve given me in life. </p>\n\n<p>I have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. My sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and I’m happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. Now it’s my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. </p>\n\n<p>My sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. She didn’t have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. My sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they’re great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. </p>\n\n<p>I know I sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. There was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. I knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn’t want to have an infant at that age. In my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. I don’t blame her for being scared. I would have been terrified to. </p>\n\n<p>But I’m still upset that now I won’t be able to have much of a wedding because I had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. I’m not so much upset that they gave it to her, but I am upset that they gave it to her <em>knowing</em> nothing would ever come of it. That they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. My sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. </p>\n\n<p>When my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. I couldn’t hide my disappointment. I really tried to reassure them that I understood, but they could tell I was hurt. My sister called later and told me that it sucks I can’t have a ‘fancy wedding’ (like hers) but basically I need to grow up. Which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. She said she’s sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as I’d hoped. </p>\n\n<p>I know this isn’t the end of the world. This is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and I feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. I’m still getting married. My wedding won’t compare to my sister’s, but I’m still marrying the love of my life and it will still be an awesome day. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for sticking with me through the story. I know plenty of you are rolling your eyes over the dramatic bullshit that comes with weddings. So, am I overreacting?

I could really use some guidance on my next move. I have 3 frozen pgs embryos and won’t have anymore due to my age. 

Because of my precious cargo I asked for era and receptiva before moving forward with transfer. Actually I asked for era because I didn’t want to waste a cycle and my dr. suggested receptiva at the same time. He was certain it would be negative for endo because I never had fertility issues before this pesky age thing. 

Long story long, my blc6 came back elevated at 2.4 and he is recommending 2 months Lupron. The things is, I have never had signs of endo and have never done a transfer so I just don’t know if one would with without the Lupron. My regular gyn thinks I should try one without and see what happens. I’m really confused and have no idea what to do here. Any help would be appreciated!

 *Sub Rules and links to info and results threads below*

Welcome to r/infertility. **Please read our rules and our sidebar to familiarize yourself with the customs and guidelines of our subreddit before posting and participating here.**  
Please refer to the bottom of this post for the links to the Monthly Waiting and Weekly Results threads.

**SUB RULES**

Our sub has strict rules for participation. We ask that all members familiarize themselves with them in full, but here are the key points:

1. **All positive pregnancy test (beta & HPT) results should ONLY be mentioned in the weekly results thread (stickied under this thread each week). Discussions of positive tests, including beta-hell / limbo, uncertain results, or early infertility pregnancy issues/fears should ONLY be discussed in this thread.**

2. Mention of pregnancy or live children is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as we had success after x,y,z protocol). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed. Note that mentions of pregnancy loss are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area.

3. Infertility is not cute, therefore cutesy acronyms (BD, AF (when used as a Aunt Flo), DH, embies, follies, etc) are banned. The full list of banned terms can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7t7092/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms_terms/). As we all know, AF means AS FUCK. Yes, there will be cursing.

4. Infertility is stressful and it is easier to step on people’s toes than you might think. Please consider the emotional state of others during discussion here. Venting, jealousy and bitterness is to be expected.
 
5. No linking our posts outside of the infertility family.

6. If you see a post that breaks any of our rules or is troublesome to you please **use the report button**. The mods are happy to assess and remove or address reported posts. Let's all help keep this a safe, supportive community.

**Guidelines**

* Use the dailies! There are AM & PM threads posted by the automod. The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to treatment. The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.

* Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. 

**Helpful Links**

Members of this sub can be here for a long time and certain posts can get repetitive. Please use the search function before posting questions that may be more common. A few helpful mega-threads and FAQ threads can be found at the links below:

**Other helpful reddit communities you may wish to consider:**

For those who have been trying for a while or starting with infertility testing/treatment r/stilltrying has been a helpful transition sub for many before joining here.
For those who need support TTC after loss, r/TTCafterloss can provide unique support for this.

For those who have become pregnant after ART/IF treatment, or who have questions for people who have had success, r/infertilitybabies is for you.
For those transitioning to child free life after infertility r/IFchildfree is a safe space for this.

For those with children who are experiencing infertility trying for more, r/secondaryinfertility or r/IFagain may be helpful and is a safe space to mention existing children while you explore your IF.

There is a sub just for male infertility as well if any of our male members would like to connect with others in their shoes. /r/maleinfertility

<p><em>Sub Rules and links to info and results threads below</em></p>

<p>Welcome to <a href=""/r/infertility"">r/infertility</a>. <strong>Please read our rules and our sidebar to familiarize yourself with the customs and guidelines of our subreddit before posting and participating here.</strong><br/>
Please refer to the bottom of this post for the links to the Monthly Waiting and Weekly Results threads.</p>

<p><strong>SUB RULES</strong></p>

<p>Our sub has strict rules for participation. We ask that all members familiarize themselves with them in full, but here are the key points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>All positive pregnancy test (beta &amp; HPT) results should ONLY be mentioned in the weekly results thread (stickied under this thread each week). Discussions of positive tests, including beta-hell / limbo, uncertain results, or early infertility pregnancy issues/fears should ONLY be discussed in this thread.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Mention of pregnancy or live children is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as we had success after x,y,z protocol). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed. Note that mentions of pregnancy loss are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area.</p></li>
<li><p>Infertility is not cute, therefore cutesy acronyms (BD, AF (when used as a Aunt Flo), DH, embies, follies, etc) are banned. The full list of banned terms can be found <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7t7092/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms_terms/"">here</a>. As we all know, AF means AS FUCK. Yes, there will be cursing.</p></li>
<li><p>Infertility is stressful and it is easier to step on people’s toes than you might think. Please consider the emotional state of others during discussion here. Venting, jealousy and bitterness is to be expected.</p></li>
<li><p>No linking our posts outside of the infertility family.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see a post that breaks any of our rules or is troublesome to you please <strong>use the report button</strong>. The mods are happy to assess and remove or address reported posts. Let&#39;s all help keep this a safe, supportive community.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Guidelines</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the dailies! There are AM &amp; PM threads posted by the automod. The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to treatment. The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Helpful Links</strong></p>

<p>Members of this sub can be here for a long time and certain posts can get repetitive. Please use the search function before posting questions that may be more common. A few helpful mega-threads and FAQ threads can be found at the links below:</p>

<p><strong>Other helpful reddit communities you may wish to consider:</strong></p>

<p>For those who have been trying for a while or starting with infertility testing/treatment <a href=""/r/stilltrying"">r/stilltrying</a> has been a helpful transition sub for many before joining here.
For those who need support TTC after loss, <a href=""/r/TTCafterloss"">r/TTCafterloss</a> can provide unique support for this.</p>

<p>For those who have become pregnant after ART/IF treatment, or who have questions for people who have had success, <a href=""/r/infertilitybabies"">r/infertilitybabies</a> is for you.
For those transitioning to child free life after infertility <a href=""/r/IFchildfree"">r/IFchildfree</a> is a safe space for this.</p>

<p>For those with children who are experiencing infertility trying for more, <a href=""/r/secondaryinfertility"">r/secondaryinfertility</a> or <a href=""/r/IFagain"">r/IFagain</a> may be helpful and is a safe space to mention existing children while you explore your IF.</p>

<p>There is a sub just for male infertility as well if any of our male members would like to connect with others in their shoes. <a href=""/r/maleinfertility"">/r/maleinfertility</a></p>

My RE usually does 3-day transfers for me because of my (relatively) low number of retrieved eggs and my advanced age.

Previous cycles, we had transferred two, then three embryos at day three, leaving the rest to grow...but they did not form blasts. We really wanted to see if my eggs were even really capable of maturing into blastocysts, and do the agreement I had with the RE is that we would definitely be seeing if any fertilized eggs matured, knowing that I might be looking at a zero transfer at day 5.

HOWEVER, since I only have four visible follicles this time, I was informed that office policy was to likely push to implant even EARLIER (like, day 2) because my RE feels like there’s a slightly better chance inside the body than out.

It's going to be a wall of text and apologies in advance. 

**Background**

My wife and I have gone through 4 rounds of IVF. She is 40 this year, and I am 39. All the FET has no implantation. We are going to try for 1 X FET in the coming months and another Egg Collection and FET (potentially) in the Q3 of this year. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday during our consultation with the doctor, the doctor suggested for us to look into the possibility of egg donor if there is still no success in the FET coming down the road. 

My wife is not ready to accept, as for me, I felt it was the most viable method if we were to start a family in the traditional sense. 

**Questions**

1. **Is there anyone here who had used an egg donor for a baby and how did you feel about it?**
2. **How do I convince my wife that an egg donor is a viable option (I know the reasons behind her resistance, but I really want her to see my point of view and at the same time, accepting our situation.)**
3. **What are the blind spots in using an egg donor?**

Hi all!! so many people from this board have already helped me out so much & I am thankful. I'm (unfortunately) an IF veteran but soon I will start my first round of IVF  soon (having a chemical now/very early loss now- FUN!)

So I've done a ton of IUIs, had a laparoscopy, etc. I am unexplained but they did find very slight endo during the lap and removed it, plus a cyst which they also treated. I've had 2 losses and now a chemical or early loss happening now which I am hoping doesn't delay this cycle but that is a whole other post.

Anyway- current question- what are the most expensive drugs for IVF? I will be prescribed standard- gonal F, menopur, centritide and lupron. I do have a lifetime max for drugs to hit so I want to buy the most expensive with that amount and then go out of pocket. (I know I am lucky for to even have an out of pocket max and that most people don't even have that). Advice I got was to buy the gonal F and then as much as I could of menipur with the max, then go out of pocket- does this sound most advantageous financially?

207,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Some of you know my history, some don't so here's a quick synopsis:

Started with RE in 6/17 with doing 3 IUIs to counter our MFI (successful vasectomy reversal). AMH was 1.58 then and my Vit D was 31 so it was suspected that my AMH was suppressed by the Vit D. All 3 failed and we moved to IVF.

Day 3s before IVF #1:  
AMH: 0.61 ng/mL  
FSH: 6.9    
LH: 5.2  
E2: 27

4 IVF cycles have confirmed POA (premature ovarian aging) and poor egg quality. Lap was done after IVF #2 and before FET which confirmed stage 1/2 endometriosis which was excised. Did donor sperm with #4 to confirm egg or sperm issues and it was egg.

4 transfers have been done, 3 fresh and 1 frozen. #1 was fresh with 1 day 5 blast. #2 was frozen with 2 blasts. #3 was fresh with 3 days 3s (8c, 8c, 4c). #4 was fresh with 3 day 3s (8c, 4c, 4c,). 

Supplements I take: Pre-natal, CoQ10 600mg, DHEA 75mg, Myo-Inositol 1500mg, Vit D3 5000iu, Acai Berry 1500mg  
Medications: Wellbutrin XL 300mg, Adderall XR 30mg

Working on #5 right now which is currently planned for March. Protocol changes are being made including 40iu of HGH every day 6 weeks before stim starts and going through until trigger. Doing 300iu Gonal F, 150iu Menopur, and 100mg Clomid CD 3-5. Adding cetrotide later. Triggering with 2 Ovidrel.

Day 4s before IVF #5:  
AMH: 1.22ng/mL & 1.55ng/mL (it was pulled twice by accident, test results are literally 6 days apart)  
FSH: 7.9  
LH: not pulled on CD 3 by accident  
E2: 68

I am digging hard to find the reasons for implantation failure and why quality is so poor beyond ""It just is for some women."" Luckily I can boss my RE into ordering me pretty much everything I want to order testing wise so that's exactly what I've been doing. Good news is that my RPL came back perfectly negative and I'm not even remotely pre-diabetic after doing the 2hr glucose test and I'm MTHFR negative. Also finally found a good Vit D supplement that actually raised my levels to 52 (prior supplement I actually dropped in level despite being in spring). Here's some of the the things that I've found concerning with my latest round of bloodwork:

1. ANA titer (Lupus panel 5) was positive, 1:320H Homogeneous pattern (normal is <1:40)
2. Gastric Parietal Cell Antibody positive at 49 (normal is <25)
3. Antimyocardial Antibodies was positive, 1:80 Sarcolemmal pattern (normal is <1:40)
4. Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies are 80 (abnormal is >9iu). TSH is normal 1.71, T4 Free is 1.2. T3 uptake 28%. Thyroglobuline Antibodies squeak in at normal with 1 (abnormal is >1). I have a strong maternal family history of Hashimoto's, so we know that is coming as it did for my mother and aunts and grandmother.
5. C Reactive Protein slightly elevated at 3.4 H (normal is <3) 
6. Homocysteine slightly elevated at 10.7 (<10.4 is normal)
7. My hormones are off, androgens are abnormally low as shown below.

These were done on CD 17 of a 26 day cycle so beginning of mid-luteal.  
Total Testosterone: 43 (range is 2 - 45)  
Free Testosterone: 4.1 (range is 0.2 - 5.0)  
Androstenedione: 54 (Mid-Luteal should be 73-184, I fall in the postmenopausal range)  
17-Hydroxyprogesterone: 67 (Mid-luteal should be 139-431)  
DHEA-S: 77 (range is 18-391, but CHR called this very low. I had stopped taking DHEA a month prior at last retrieval)

These were done on CD 4, after the previous results:  
Total Testosterone: 16  
Free Testosterone: 1.4  
Sex Hormone Binding Globulin: 50 (I was told by CHR to expect it to be 90+)

If you're still with me, you're pretty amazing. Just saying.

A lot of these results fall within indications of inflammation in the body and part of that can be attributed to being heavy. Majority of these point to adrenal and thyroid which could in turn be affecting the androgens and hormones as they are partly responsible for production of them in addition to the ovaries. I know I don't have they symptoms of lupus so I doubt that's it despite the positive titer. My rheumatoid factor was negative so it's not RA too. Possibly just a side effect of inflammation? Also thinking I have a B-12 deficiency because of the GPCAs maybe related to pernicious anemia (but seems unlikely) since I take B-12.

For physical symptoms I've had (whether related or unrelated): 

1. Chronic constipation since 17/18 (like I go once or twice a week). Colonoscopy in 2009 had lesions, but biopsy was benign. Diagnosed with IBS-C and sent on my merry way. I had GERD too, but it just went away without lifestyle change. This runs in my family on both sides.
2. Extreme difficulty losing weight even under medically supervised plans. I gained 40lbs in one year without changing lifestyle at all. GP and endocrinologist just dismissed it and thought I was lying about eating and exercise habits (I was 19 and loading trucks at UPS for a living in addition to riding horses daily and eating normally). Dieting like cutting carbs and fats exasperates my IBS to where I will go over a week without going or having an urge to go. 
3. Chest pains since I was 11. They are in the left chest and a pulling pain with no shortness of breath. EKGs have all been normal. Not panic attacks and don't happen during them. They last for a few minutes and then go away.
4. Frequent Tinnitus (at least 4+ times per week that I notice). No headaches to go with it, just the ear rining.
5. Cold Intolerance forever even though I live in Florida. I keep a heater under my desk and run it pretty much all day (office is set to 74).
6. Nerve issues, especially sciatica though could be more attributed to horse wreck in 2010. They've continued since even with chiropractic work. I lose feeling in my legs easily and get pins and needles easily. Restless leg syndrome that comes and goes. Muscle relaxers do nothing. Gabapentin is a lifesaver.
7. ADHD that got significantly worse at 19/20. Not medicated up until that point and didn't have issues that couldn't be handled with techniques (lists, planners, etc) and some self-discipline. ADHD runs in family including my father and my sister and cousins.
8. Insomnia that started 6 years ago. Regularly get 3-5 hours of sleep which I am completely functional on with full mental acuity (even off Adderall). It can come and go, but mostly here. Trouble falling asleep and if I wake up, trouble going back to sleep. 
9. Depression that was undiagnosed (didn't realize that's what it was) until about 6ish years ago? Infertility sent it spiralling to where therapy wasn't enough anymore. Depression and anxiety both go hand in hand so that's more than likely where it stims from.

Normally I wouldn't go with the whole physical symptoms thing but that seems to be the way that autoimmune issues are diagnosed in addition to bloodwork. I kinda did it the opposite way since I've been ignored by doctors with my concerns for years because of age.

If anyone has any insights, I'd greatly appreciate it. I've got an appointment with my RE set up for next Friday. Should I look at setting something up with a rheumatologist as well? Or an endocrinologist? As I'm supposed to start HGH on Jan 10th for my March cycle, I'm wondering if this is something I should get handled before the IVF or just before transfer. I'm doing probably 2 cycles of banking at least before transferring.

This starts a few months ago when I changed companies. They're owned by generally the same people, so it wasn't a big deal. But the new company did have different insurance. What they didn't realize when I transferred is that the new insurance didn't kick in until a month after I started. So I was left one month without insurance, that's the month I had shingles. Nothing like getting shingles when you are under 40 to make you feel real special. 

My old boss takes FOREVER authorizing COBRA. Wouldn't put me in touch with them. It's almost two months later by the time I can finally start getting my claims reimbursed. 

I think that ends there, but nope. Turns out my old provider, who was told the COBRA insurance only lasts a month, decided to keep on insuring me/charging my old company, who then tells me the other day that I owe them $8000.

While that's being figured out, I go in today to start my new cycle for egg retrieval. I realize I haven't gotten my meds and I'm not super worried because I know the pharmacy is nearby and can get them for me 24 hours. So I start calling to see what's up. After an unusually long wait, otherwise fantastic pharmacy says my new insurance never authorized them! Thanks for telling us, new insurance! 

So I call my provider to figure it out and oh boy, I got the worst agent. She never introduces herself, first of all, which I wouldn't care about, but now I can't report her. She just starts telling me, really condescendingly, how insurance works. She makes assumptions about my situation. Because I'm new to the provider, she thinks I'm also knew to having infertility, and so tells me all about how to do things I've done 50 times already. She talks for minutes without a break and I'm too nice to interrupt, until I can finally say ""I've been doing this for a year and a half."" She apologizes, which is something. So I ask, ""when will I get my medications?"" and she starts hedging, telling me that how it's HARD for THEM to fill out prior authorizations, in a tone that implies I should be SORRY for them. SORRY? For your company doing ITS JOB? Why are you not sorry for me, the person who did nothing wrong, and has infertility BTW? You know because you all have it so hard I now have to wait another fucking 5 weeks (well, maybe not, but I didn't know that at the time)? Turns out my doctor's office is the one who made the mistake—something she could have told me \*at the beginning of this time-sensitive phone call\*—it's not my fault. I've done nothing wrong, yet I'm the one who has to deal with all this shit. 

And yes, I know, I have to be on top of everything, it's not the first time someone else has dropped the ball, and I should've known something was up when I didn't get my medications. But with just everything going on I just need a break.

I just had my first (and first failed) IUI on 12/16. Negative home tests throughout on Days 9, 12, and 15, blood test today came back negative and also finally started spotting (period was a few days late) so I ended up with a 32 day cycle.

I had an ultrasound on CD 13 and had two follicles at 20.1 and 21.1 mm after 150mg of Clomid on CD 5-9. We triggered that morning and did the IUI the next morning on CD 14.

Since I had such a long cycle, I'm wondering if it would be beneficial to wait another day or two for follicles to grow to do an IUI? I know they usually consider 18+ to be mature, but I can't help but wonder if I would benefit from another day or so? I know I risk ovulating on my own at that point, but I could do OPKs starting mid-cycle to monitor and let my doctor know if I saw the surge.

This was my first IUI so I'm trying not to be sad about it, but I can't really help but wonder if I should do something different, particularly given the cost of donor sperm. I've never tried to get pregnant before, and I know I have low AMH because I initially was hoping to freeze eggs instead of TTC solo. My AMH makes me a lousy IVF candidate, but no other known fertility issues and I ovulate on my own. My infertility is mostly social at this point.

Thoughts? I don't want to be an annoying patient, but since TTC for me is $2k every time, I want to do everything I can to do it right!

But then it actually happened. 

Except for me. 

And the coworker that had never been pregnant and I are pretty close and she was so scared to tell me. But I took it really well. I was actually happy for her.

Hello everyone,

I read through the wiki post on what to do when your FET failed at it was very helpful. I'm wondering if there are different recommendations/ management for chemical pregnancies after fet vs. complete lack of implantation (i.e., no positive beta)? I am particularly concerned because I have recurrent pregnancy loss, and this is the stage where I always seem to fall apart. I'm starting to think this will never work and I'm feeling really, really down today.

A little background on me... I'm 34 and my husband is 38. We had success 4 years ago. We started trying again 2 years ago and I had 2 CP's and 1 MMC within the first year of trying. I did a RPL panel, which identified chronic endometritis (treated successfully with doxy) and elevated, but not clinically significant, anti-cardiolipid levels. We moved on to IVF, thinking PGS testing and the highly controlled environment would be the solution to our problems. We had an egg retrieval resulting in 35 eggs, 30 mature, 22 fertilized normally, 8 day 5 blasts, 5 PGS normal. The embryo we just transferred was graded 5AA. I'm convinced there is something really, really wrong with me that I keep having losses and not even such a healthy embryo could implant in my toxic wasteland of a uterus. 

I'm meeting w/ my RE on 1/7. I'm planning to ask about immunological factors (though I already know what she thinks of that, which is not much). Should I be asking about anything else? Is chemical pregnancy treated the same as a negative beta, or does it matter one way or the other that it somewhat implanted? Anyone else doing IVF for RPL?

basic summary:
2005: husband lost a testicle to torsion at age 17
2005-2018 husband was told everything would be fine re: fertility and not to worry, etc
2013: we get married 
2018: we finished grad school and are ready to start a family 
2018: we find out he’s azoospermic (has no sperm). not due to xxy or y-chromosome micro-deletion. hormones are “off”. 
december 2018: specialist recommends clomid and mtese procedure, aligned with ivf cycle for me (with the hopes of using any extracted sperm if found) + donor backup

husband is 30. i’m 32 with no known fertility issues on my part.  i never grew up NEEDING to be a wife or a mom, but now that i’m in love and have been with this amazing partner for 9 years, i was really looking forward to raising a family with him. i felt like 2018 kept bringing us bad news after bad news. i always said i’d never consider IVF (always assumed that if we had fertility issues, they’d be on my end), and that if we did have kids I hope they’re exactly like him (patient, kind, etc). 

and here we are. if we want any chance of having biological kids, ivf + microtese is our only shot. specialist doesn’t think it makes sense to do his mtese until i do ivf so that if they do find sperm they can do a direct transfer (and not risk losing it in thawing and freezing). 

husband is all for donor back up (though we haven’t started looking for donors together yet). we’ve been pouring over reddit threads, scientific articles and blogs for months to better educate ourselves re: raising a donor conceived person.  

i have generalized anxiety to begin with and have a difficult time with needles / medical procedures / doctors. that, in combination with considering the possible experience of our potential offspring and our family dynamics were we to go ahead with this path have consumed our thoughts for months. 

so, lovely, supportive and helpful people of reddit:

1. is ivf scary? did it work for you?  what were some of the difficulties you experienced throughout the process?

2. what was the mtese procedure like for you? recovery? worth it?

3. how did you come to your decision to move forward with donor sperm / donor backup? were you concerned with how this choice might impact your kids? or your relationship with your SO?

4. what are some factors you deemed crucial in choosing your donor? 

5. is there a specific cryobank you recommend / why?

6. if you’re currently raising a donor conceived child, how’s that going for you? does the fact that they’re donor conceived still consume your thoughts? has your family dynamic adjusted?

7. how do you manage all of these choices and decisions and work and school and life and still stay calm?

i understand that all of this is so personal and there’s no “right decision.”  we haven’t really discussed our experience with our friends since most have either just given birth or are pregnant, and we just can’t bring ourselves to unload our stressors on them and make them feel a certain way.

This is my first time doing a Lupron protocol -- suppression instead of stimming -- so I'm not 100% sure what to expect here.

Is it normal to still be spotting after a week and a half on estrogen patches?

&#x200B;

My final pre-PIO/pre-transfer bloodwork-and-ultrasound is tomorrow with transfer tentatively scheduled for the 9th, and I'm still spotting pink from my post-BCP period, which started Dec 22nd. My regular periods are never this long, so I'm assuming it's the medication.  


My last endometrial check was good at nearly 8mm/multilayered and e2 was at 180 on the 29th (one week after starting estrogen patches). I'm doing 5 units Lupron per day and 3 Vivelle patches every other day right now.

Obviously, I'm gonna ask at the appointment tomorrow as well, but the office is closed for non-emergency stuff today, and it just occurred to me last night that still spotting might not be normal.

I finally have my plan to start stims (yay!!) I'll have one Elonva injection on jan 4th, then nothing else until first monitoring on 9th, when they'll maybe add something else I guess.

I’ve been lurking for a little while but haven’t posted so I figured I should introduce myself and am not sure if that info may sway the advice I receive. My main question- Has anyone skipped IUI and gone straight to IVF?

We don’t have coverage for either and the global rate for IUI at our clinic is 1800 (will probably run us 2k a month after meds). I almost feel like it would be more cost effective to opt into a shared risk program. I’m worried about shelling out 6k and being told to pursue more aggressive treatment and feeling like we could have covered 1/3 of that with that money.

I think I am also hesitant because we have no male factor so I don’t think IUI will increase our changes. We previously had success with clomid and timed intercourse which is where we started this round back in April. I have pcos and no longer responded to clomid but asked to try letrozole. (PCOS has mainly been confirmed through high LH levels that actually decrease as follicles mature) I respond to 7.5 mg with about 2 follicles each time. We had success in the second round back in August but miscarried (this is our second miscarriage). We have now completed 3 rounds all negative betas.

We had a follow up on the 18th in the middle of this last round to talk about switching to IUI from timed intercourse but I think I was caught off guard because I thought he would want us to move onto injectables (which I was going to ask for a combo cycle to save money and hopefully not overstimulate). I have to have a hysterscopy for to check for possible scar tissue as my hsg showed a filling defect but I opted to put off surgery as I’d never been put to sleep before. We will have to take this next month off with that so we have time to talk things through.

There's some coupon available for omnitrope, but it only applies to on-label uses, which doesn't include IVF. But the coupon organization told me to call the Novartis patient assistance program. I learned today that Novartis offers FREE omnitrope to qualifying patients who are US residents, regardless of reason for use, based on household income.  Thresholds below:

1 Person < $ 75,000

2 People < $100,000

3 People < $125,000

4 People < $150,000

5 People Add $25,000 for each additional person

&#x200B;

There are a few steps:

(1) Call Novartis at 800-277-2254. They will do a 15 min pre-qualification interview. If you pre-qualify, you can get 90 days worth of free omnitrope while the official application is pending. I think it still takes a couple of weeks to get the first dose though.

(2) Fill out the Novartis application [here](https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment). Fill out the patient section yourself and fax it in to the number listed, then have your provider fill out the physician section and fax to the number listed.

(3) Have your provider send your omnitrope prescription to Novartis at the same fax as in #2.

(4) Call 877-456-6794 to talk with Omnisource. They'll ask your doctor to send a statement of medical necessity to them at 877-828-1052.

306,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'm prepping for an IVF cycle and we're currently planning on lupron and OCPs in advance, then follistim/gonal 300u and menopur 150u, with ovidrel trigger. However I'm trying to figure out whether this is really the best ratio of follistim to menopur, whether to freeze at day 3 or at day 5, and whether the protocol is otherwise ideal. I'll summarize my back story since it's complicated.

HISTORY

I've done 7 prior cycles, have always ended up on 450u total. The first four cycles were when I was 34-36 yrs old. Used OCPs in advance and ganirilex for suppression midway through. The split was 225 menopur/225 bravelle (same as follistim/gonal). Stimmed for 12-14 days, always with VERY slow rise in estrogen initially, but ultimately peak estrogen at 1300-2100. Three cycles produced 14-20 eggs, with around 90% fertilization, 1-4 blasts on day 5. Likely a MFI component due to borderline SA. The fourth only produced 8 eggs with 4/8 fertilizing normally, but we still got two blasts. Nothing was PGS tested, but we two transfers resulted in two losses (9w mc of identical twins, 20w termination for severe neural tube defect). Post-loss testing was normal.

Fifth cycle - 36 years old. This was with a new doctor. This time we did OCP before for a couple of weeks, overlapped with lupron which I continued into the cycle, no ganirilex, and only 75 menopur with 375 gonal F. Triggered on day 12. 15 eggs, 90% fertilized, three blasts, 2/3 PGS normal. Transferred both, success with one. Same slow rise of estrogen initially, peaked around 1400.

Sixth cycle - 38 years old. No lupron, instead did OCP with ganirilex midway through. Went up to something like 150 menopur, 450 gonal f. This was with a third doctor who freaked with my initial slow rise in estrogen, although it's always been that way. Didn't move things any faster - still triggered Day 13. Collected 10 eggs, 9/10 fertilized, they said the quality looked great. But no blasts on day 5.

Seventh cycle. 38 years old. Dialed back on the stims to mimic my successful fifth cycle, except we did 300u follistim and 150u menopur because the RE said that this was better than 375/75. Did OCP, lupron, and HGH, but didn't start HGH until stim day 5 for some reason. 18 eggs, 17/18 fertilized, quality looked as expected for age, worse than sixth cycle. Had a bunch going on day 3, transferred the three best (including one ""rock star""), ended up with a singleton pregnancy and miscarriage at 10w, likely due to aneuploidy based on a large yolk sac.

Now going into our eight cycle (sigh). We have several blasts frozen, but I want multiple kids, so I'm trying to make as many embryos when/if we still can.  Also, this time we're testing for DNA frag and using microfluidics for sperm sorting (thanks to u/chulzle!) I don't have high hopes based on our past two cycles, but I'm doing it just so I know we tried everything. Planning for a freeze all and instead will transfer one of our PGS normals.

FIRST QUESTION:

As I said, my doctor is thinking 300/150 split, but I'm wondering if whether to advocate for 225/225, 375/75, or something else - maybe even lowering our total dose? In general, what's the best combo for a decent responder on high doses with egg quality as expected for age? We have good fert rates, terrible blast rates, which could be due to MFI, but maybe not. DNA frag testing pending.

SECOND QUESTION:

We did HGH 12iu every other starting on day 5. This time, I'll start it day 1. I've seen some protocols where people do it daily, not sure where this every other day approach is coming from. What have you guys done? Any HGH gurus who can recommend a protocol?

THIRD QUESTION:

Would you freeze on Day 3 or Day 5? If you freeze on Day 3, do you freeze the ones that look crappy, too? Or only the good looking ones? We've always had steep losses from Day 3 to Day 5, possibly due to MFI, but maybe microfluidics will change that? We won't know until we try. But my RE and lab director also say that some small percentage of embryos that fail to get to Day 5 would have been successful in utero. So I lean towards freezing on Day 3, but the certainty of Day 5 is also appealing.

However I&#39;m trying to figure out whether this is really the best ratio of follistim to menopur, whether to freeze at day 3 or at day 5, and whether the protocol is otherwise ideal. I&#39;ll summarize my back story since it&#39;s complicated.</p>

<p>HISTORY</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done 7 prior cycles, have always ended up on 450u total. The first four cycles were when I was 34-36 yrs old. Used OCPs in advance and ganirilex for suppression midway through. The split was 225 menopur/225 bravelle (same as follistim/gonal). Stimmed for 12-14 days, always with VERY slow rise in estrogen initially, but ultimately peak estrogen at 1300-2100. Three cycles produced 14-20 eggs, with around 90% fertilization, 1-4 blasts on day 5. Likely a MFI component due to borderline SA. The fourth only produced 8 eggs with 4/8 fertilizing normally, but we still got two blasts. Nothing was PGS tested, but we two transfers resulted in two losses (9w mc of identical twins, 20w termination for severe neural tube defect). Post-loss testing was normal.</p>

<p>Fifth cycle - 36 years old. This was with a new doctor. This time we did OCP before for a couple of weeks, overlapped with lupron which I continued into the cycle, no ganirilex, and only 75 menopur with 375 gonal F. Triggered on day 12. 15 eggs, 90% fertilized, three blasts, 2/3 PGS normal. Transferred both, success with one. Same slow rise of estrogen initially, peaked around 1400.</p>

<p>Sixth cycle - 38 years old. No lupron, instead did OCP with ganirilex midway through. Went up to something like 150 menopur, 450 gonal f. This was with a third doctor who freaked with my initial slow rise in estrogen, although it&#39;s always been that way. Didn&#39;t move things any faster - still triggered Day 13. Collected 10 eggs, 9/10 fertilized, they said the quality looked great. But no blasts on day 5.</p>

<p>Seventh cycle. 38 years old. Dialed back on the stims to mimic my successful fifth cycle, except we did 300u follistim and 150u menopur because the RE said that this was better than 375/75. Did OCP, lupron, and HGH, but didn&#39;t start HGH until stim day 5 for some reason. 18 eggs, 17/18 fertilized, quality looked as expected for age, worse than sixth cycle. Had a bunch going on day 3, transferred the three best (including one &quot;rock star&quot;), ended up with a singleton pregnancy and miscarriage at 10w, likely due to aneuploidy based on a large yolk sac.</p>

<p>Now going into our eight cycle (sigh). We have several blasts frozen, but I want multiple kids, so I&#39;m trying to make as many embryos when/if we still can.  Also, this time we&#39;re testing for DNA frag and using microfluidics for sperm sorting (thanks to <a href=""/u/chulzle"">u/chulzle</a>!) I don&#39;t have high hopes based on our past two cycles, but I&#39;m doing it just so I know we tried everything. Planning for a freeze all and instead will transfer one of our PGS normals.</p>
