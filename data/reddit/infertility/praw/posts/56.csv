0,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"38 unexplained, TTC #1 for 3 years, 2 failed iui, never had positive pregnancy test in my life, planning for first ivf. 

My doctor was going to do frozen with psg testing. I asked why fresh was not an option, was told fresh is cheaper so only if you don't have enough money/insurance to financially support frozen would you do a fresh transfer. Was also told you want to be using the best embryo for transfer. I went looking for a 2nd opinion with a new doctor/medical group, not because of the frozen transfer, just because I was frustrated with the communication during my IUI's with this doctor and wanted things to go more smoothly with ivf.

Today saw another doctor part of another medical group. New doctor said he agreed with the previous doctors recommendations except he would suggest a fresh transfer instead of frozen. And then freeze any extra embryos (not with psg testing) for later in life if I would like a 2nd child. When I asked why he didn't recommend frozen with psg for the transfer, he said you only need this if you might have a problem with miscarriage or chromosomal abnormalities. Of course this does not seem to be an issue for me, at least not yet. I think doctor sees psg testing as an extra unnecessary expense as they will still make sure they are transferring a good embryo. I would like to mention this new doctor would support a frozen transfer with psg testing if that is my request.

This took me by surprise. I felt the medical group for the first doctor was treating their patients like they are in an ivf factory, I think everyone is told to do frozen. I definitely felt a more personal touch at the new doctor today. I felt more like a person not a number. 

Any thoughts or opinions? I don't think there is right or wrong answer here. I am really undecided about which route to go down. It does make sense that if you are investing all this time and money you might as well spend some more money and make sure your getting the best bet for your money. But I also appreciate not playing god so much and letting nature take it's course. Maybe there is something else I'm missing or need to consider in the decision?


**UPDATE***
I spoke with both doctors again.

First doctor who recommends frozen with PGS and she estimated 70% chance you get a heart beat. 68% chance it makes it to live birth. I am not sure if 68% is based on the original 100% that go through IVF or the 70% that get a heart beat. Asked her why she thought another doctor could be recommending fresh transfer and she said she couldn't understand how any doctor could recommend that. That I'm just increasing my chance for miscarriage which is something you want to avoid emotionally and also time wise can set me back. This doctor also told me there is no point to transfer day 3 embryos, see below for more on this.

Second doctor who recommends fresh transfer then freezing without PGS said I have about a 30% chance of success. I questioned him on why he feel this is better than frozen with pgs. He said he cannot understand how any doctor could not be recommending fresh transfer. He then went on to explain that they will monitor the embryos and at day 3 if they are not looking very good then can do a transfer because they have a better chance at survival inside of you than outside. He also then went on to suggest that I may only end up with a few good embryos anyways of which at some point in my life I will want to use both as he assumes I want another kid later on. The only other thing I can say is this clinic has a special way of monitoring the embryos when they are growing and they look at them monitor them 24/7 under a camera, so they can watch them grow in a time lapse format. They are the only clinic in the US to offer this and there is very little info online about how effective this really is. But perhaps this gives some better indication on how they are growing which might suggest how good they are.

Honestly to me it makes no sense to do fresh. Finances are not my concern at all. And infertility has already been such an emotional process for me and I would want to minimize the chance of miscarriage as it would be devastating. I'm definitely leaning toward frozen with psg, but also I do really like the clinic that suggested fresh. The facility is nicer and the communication way more clear. The doctor there said he would support frozen with psg testing but then I question if he is the right doctor for me.

It came as a complete shock after our first round of IVF that we would have to move onto donor eggs (that are almost impossible to get in Canada and very costly if you can). Previous to this, we had no idea there were any problems. It came as a shock...and it hurt. We didn't know where to turn or what to do. In a few short weeks we had to say goodbye to any future kids...future grand kids, future son and daughter in laws, future happiness. I started to worry that I was going to lose my marriage along with everything else. My husband could have all the things that were just ripped away from us...all he had to do was find someone else. Who would want me anyways? I'm broken physically and now mentally. If he met me today for the first time, he would probably walk away. This isn't what he signed up for. Instead of us both hurting, maybe I can just bare the pain for both of us so he can go and be happy. It's the least I could do. It wasn't him that was broken.

I explained it to my mom like this...mom, close your eyes and picture your three girls, your three son in laws and your six grand kids. Remember us growing up, our first day in big girl beds, first days of schools, our first day of college, our weddings. Remember the birth of your grand kids, the holidays, the vacations, remember all the amazing times we have had together....now erase them all. What is left? It's in those times we truly live and if we don't have those times, than what makes life worth living?

The sad part is after we had our ""loss"" there were no flowers. There were no cards or days off work to try and pull ourselves together. People haven't asked us how we are, or how they can help. They don't understand. Infertility is a lonely planet.

Some days (like today) are hard. I know I will find other things in life to fill the void. The sun will shine again. Maybe I will go back to school. Maybe I will start volunteering. No matter what I decide to do however, I want the world to know I would have made a kick ass mom. I would have made them eat their veggies but let them know the joy of a Cadbury cream egg. They would have had chores but also time to build forts and dream. I would keep the magic of childhood alive but also prepared them to be adults. I would have hugged them and kissed them probably too tight. Most of all I would have loved our babies and loved their babies and their babies babies.

Not sure why I wrote this...maybe to make myself feel better. Maybe because someone else had to hear it. For all of you out there suffering through infertility, know that no matter where you are in your journey, we walk along side you. You are not alone, and that is something certain in all this uncertainty.

After the 5th miscarriage, my wife's doctor recommended I visit a urologist to have a semen analysis.  So, went in, spoke to the doctor and explained our situation as stated above, and told him we wanted to check if my sperm was okay.  He said okay and said ""I'm also going to order you some blood work as well since typically someone in your situation would do that.""  Semen analysis came back fine but I received a bill for $1,700 for a ""Chromosomal Microarray"" that won't be covered by insurance because ""patient is not symptomatic and no fetal demise in the third trimester.""

I'm just confused and wondering if based on any of the experiences of this group, is this blood test commonly utilized for infertility?

As additional info, we had Karyotyping after this blood test a few months later.  The genetic counselor said the Microarray provided no actionable intelligence and the results of our Karyotype came back perfect.  Thus, up until this point, we're entirely 'unexplained'.

We have been tested. 

He has high viscosity and just slightly low volume (but good count and motility). 

I have low overian reserve for my age and one of my tubes is inconclusive and being treated as blocked.

So in 2016 my now fiancé was diagnosed with stage two testicular cancer. Course of treatment was removal of the malignant testicle & two rounds of chemo. Thankful he is in remission for almost 2 years. However, this has left him sterile. At first it wasn't a big deal, I never really wanted kids, but the more I fall in love with him the more I want a child with him. Yet, I know this is most likely never going to happen. At least not biologically speaking. 

Fast forward to a week ago, he and I went out to eat with some friends and we found out that they are expecting their first child. They had been trying for a long time and were finally able to get a pregnancy to be viable. So knowing their struggle to become pregnant and finally being able to carry past 2 months made me happy...At first... the whole dinner we were talking about their excitement and the more we talked the more envious I got. My fiancé was holding my hand the whole time because he knows this is something that I've been struggling with lately. Every time they talked about her being pregnant I had to fight back the urge to cry. The urge to not yell at her because I was jealous. We finally left the restaurant, said our good byes and went our separate ways. As soon as I saw them leave I burst into tears. My fiancé hugged me and then I felt guilty because it's not his fault that he had cancer. It's not my fault. There was really nothing we could have done do prevent him getting cancer as he does have a family history of it. 

It took me a couple of days to get passed it and truly be happy for my friends. But then... today I found out that another friend of mine had a baby yesterday. He kept it a secret because he didn't want me to hurt, so I guess I should be thankful? I honestly didn't even know he was with someone as he's off at school.

Not to mention I'm only 1 week in to a month's worth of BCP after being sidelined from cysts following our first failed IUI attempt.

I know the stats on IUI so I wasn't overly heartbroken about that, but I'm well past the due date from the MC and following the failed IUI up with a month of doing basically nothing sucks. It didn't help that after multiple negative tests, but before we saw all the cysts on my CD3 scan, the nurse thought she might have seen something in my uterus (which of course wasn't actually anything). This whole thing is such an effing roller coaster. And I know we're just ""getting started"" and can't even compare what we've been through so far to what some of you have endured.

Welcome to the first meeting of the Barren Bitches Harry Potter book club. This month, we'll be discussing the first book in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosospher's Stone (also known as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone). 

So, grab your book, maybe a glass of wine, and get ready to chat!

Below, I've provided some discussion questions to help get things rolling. However, if there's something else related to the book you'd like to discuss, by all means, go ahead! 

1. Why do you think Dumbledore chose to place Harry with the Dursleys as opposed to a wizarding family?

2. Why do you think it took Harry's wand so long to choose him when he visited Diagon Alley?

3. How are Dudley Dursley and Malfoy similar? What characteristics to they bring out in Harry?

4. In what ways are Harry and Ron complementary? Contrary? What about Harry and Hermione? 

5. Why do you think Dumbledore chooses to give Harry the cloak of invisibility?

6. The Mirror of Erised ""shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts...but will give us neither knowledge nor truth."" What does this mean to you?

7. Quirrell tells Harry that ""there is no good and evil, only power, and those too weak to seek it."" Agree or disagree?

Next month, we'll move on to the second book in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The discussion thread will be posted on Friday, April 27th.

A lot of your meds do not REQUIRE refrigeration at all times.  I encourage you to take a look at your packaging before you feel like you are tied to your fridge during stims ;)

I posted this in the active thread, but thought maybe it'd be useful more broadly.

Pharmacies don't know what you are doing with the meds, or when your cycle is, so they encourage the refrigeration for longevity.  However, I've found that most of my meds actually say that they are good for 28 days if stored at reasonable room temp.  I've quit worrying about keeping the ones I'm using during my cycle in the fridge if it's not easy to do so, like traveling or going out for an evening... or forgetting to pick up my shipment until the next morning (whoops!)

**Look at your specific medication packaging/insert.**  Instructions can vary some still, particularly for drugs that are powder and/or need to be mixed.

I'm linking to the pharmacy I use personally here because they have a nice concise list (Mandell's - they have been awesome), but I've confirmed against the package inserts for the ones I've used personally.

> **Store at room temperature** between 59°F and 77°F (15°C and 25°C) **for up to 90 days**. If product is kept refrigerated then it is good until the expiration date written on the box. **Once used store** refrigerated or **unrefrigerated for a maximum of 28 days**.

[Ganirelix instructions](http://www.mymandellspharmacy.com/instruction#ganirelix)

77,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey guys, I'm sorry for the separate post.   But I'm at my ropes end and need your help.  My clinic and insurance company cannot answer my questions.

I'm DOR and my husband and I are both carriers of the same serious disease.  If my husband's insurance policy covers IVF up to 3 attempts per live birth, does it make sense to switch to his policy for our diagnosis?  Or should we just stay on mine for the fertility meds and take out a loan for the remaining IVF cycles?  

I'm worried his insurance policy would require us to do PGD testing immediately after every egg retrieval.  Meaning, if our blast tests normal, they'd require us to transfer in order to be covered.  This worries me because it could potentially take longer for a successful transfer (time spent waiting for PGD test results and more time waiting for my next period to come) AND we could potentially run out of IVF attempts before we ever get a normal tested blast.

Background:  

We have done 2 IVF cycles.  The first one failed when we didn't have any good quality blasts to freeze.  The second one we managed to get 1 blast frozen.  The biopsy has been sent to the genetics company.  Unfortunately, the genetics company are not going to test the biopsy until we are done with all of our IVF cycles.  Otherwise we'll have to pay $4500 every time they run the test.  The $4500 fee covers up to 16 embryos but they have to all be tested at the same time.  So who knows when that time will be.

My husband's insurance MIGHT cover PGD, but only if I was on his insurance BEFORE we sent the biopsy to them. Shoulda woulda coulda. 

I'm worried his insurance will require us to test every biopsy immediately after each egg retrieval because his insurance probably won't cover PGD since we have already sent the first biopsy over to the genetics company. And if his insurance requires us to test each biopsy immediately after each egg retrieval, we could be paying out of pocket $4500 for every time they run the test.

My insurance policy has a $15000 lifetime max policy for IVF treatment.  There's a good chance will be hitting that max once the claims from our 2nd egg retrieval get posted.  At best, we have enough coverage for one more egg retrieval under my policy because we haven't done any transfers yet. Its hard to say because our clinic is 2 months behind on billing, so my insurance hasn't received all of the claims yet.  But fertility meds are covered.  

We were advised the day before our 3rd IVF cycle began to wait a month and see what claims get posted, otherwise, there was a chance we'd be paying out of pocket and potentially even more than a regular out of pocket cycle would cost.  

This past week we started looking into getting me on my husband's insurance.  Since his open enrollment isn't until September, I'd have to go part-time in order to qualify for special enrollment.

Just a bit of background, I am on my 2nd cycle of IVF - medications this cycle are Lupron (20 units, 2x day), Menopur (2 vials of 75 units 1x/day), and Gonal-F (300 units 1x/day). 
I did my hCG trigger shot last night at 7:45 and have my egg retrieval tomorrow morning.
Currently, I am on Augmentin for a sinus infection, which caused me to  have horrible diarrhea on Sunday to the point where I could not leave my house and was in the bathroom most of the day. 
I usually take Apriso for ulcerative colitis (my uc was aggravated by the Augmentin) but discontinued it since starting IVF.
Today is Wednesday and I have not had a bowel movement since the bout of diarrhea on Sunday. I have been drinking a LOT of water, and had coffee this morning. Still nothing.
I feel so horribly bloated and uncomfortable.
Is this a normal side effect of IVF meds?
Any suggestions or tips for addressing it?
I didn't want to take anything for fear of drug interactions and the fact that I will be under sedation tomorrow for the retrieval.
It is just so uncomfortable right now.

***UPDATE*** 
ER went well - 8 eggs retrieved (a bit bummed about that but it's my first time getting to this stage so keeping my fingers crosse); Nurse said Colace is fine and also recommended warm prune juice. Stopped at a CVS on the way home from ER and got the Colace, but they did not have prune juice. I didn't feel up to braving a grocery store, and my partner had to go to work, so I took the Colace when I got home and have been chugging water - the nurse also said to drink at least 2 L of water today. So far, no action with the Colace, but hoping the water will help get things moving along. Thanks all for info and support!

***UPDATE #2***
Got call from nurse this morning - out of 8 eggs retrieved, 7 were mature and 6 fertilized. Now to wait. I did talk to her about the constipation and she also recommended Colace 2x/day as a first step. I took another Colace this morning with some warm prune juice (not as bad as I thought it would be). She said to call if the constipation does not relieve by Sunday.

Ugh Chicago Med, just no. Had a patient that was 55 and thought they had gone through menopause only to find out they were pregnant/about to give birth. 

The Resident-Had mention of someone that was now pregnant after years of IF treatments, and they had an etopic along with a pregnancy so needed to be rushed to surgery. 

Started watching Trust a show about the Gettys, wow their life seems so crazy. Hooked me enough to watch another episode next week.

Rise-I like this show, though only 3 episodes so far. Great if you like plays/more artsy stuff, if you liked Rent you'll enjoy this.

Looking forward to The Americans coming back tonight.

Married at first sight is a hot mess, had some mention of how the couples felt about wanting to have children with their spouse.

For the People-No triggers but also pretty meh

Mary Kills People-I really enjoy this show, no triggers. 

Billions came back on Showtime, I really enjoy this show. Though it's weird to see Brody from Homeland in a different role.

UnRreal-no triggers, just drama. 

Good Doctor-No mention of the IF side plot, and it was the season finale. 

Going to give Alex, Inc, and splitting up together a try tonight, both of the previews looked moderately interesting. 

The Looming Tower-Up to episode 7, really enjoying this show.

I was pretty active on this sub a few months ago but needed some time to mentally regroup after my failed fresh IVF transfer in January and to focus on passing my medical board exams a few weeks later (which I did- so relieved!). Sorry to have suddenly abandoned you all but I am still around and still eternally grateful for all the advice and well-wishes I've received.

Life update- now on Lupron and OCPs for a projected 4/26 FET, had a hysteroscopy this morning under IV sedation in the OR to eval for fluid that was in my lining during my Jan IVF cycle. Super easy on my part with easy recovery so far. The surgeon found and removed 1 unexpected 0.5cm polyp at the fundus and scraped away some proliferative endometrium that should not have been there since I've been on OCPs. As an 'unexplained' patient this is big news and may shed some light on why we've had no success yet.

Any other ladies out there with a similar hysteroscopy experience? Or other thoughts? Fingers crossed that today's procedure will give our FET a fighting chance. I'm also now paranoid that my RE will call and say this cycle is cancelled due to the findings but I have no reason to expect this right now.

Well today was my punch in the gut as I went to an RE for the first time; I'd had no reason to think anything was specifically wrong but when I mentioned short periods (23-26 days), she immediately had me do an ultrasound. Her commentary was getting worse and worse to the point where she double checked my last pap was clear. Back in the office I don't know if she was trying to let me down gently but she spent like 20 minutes explaining the reproductive process with a car analogy, always dropping hints at how she'd come back to my bad news. This was so awful, I wish she had started off that way. Anyway, it turns out I have the ovarian reserve not usually seen in anyone under 40, tons of scarring in my uterus, something with pits in the lining of my uterus called adeno -something?, and a very visibly inflamed/blocked left tube, with a potentially blocked right tube. 

As I tried not to cry, she explained how we might want to try IUI first but with others with endometriosis, it was really a 25% shot and IVF would be more like 75% (I think she was saying out of women who did get pregnant with endo, this was how they did it).

So I cried most of the 90 minute drive home, and again when I told my husband about it. Now I'm trying to understand about follicles (I think she counted 16 and said 30 year olds should have 40 to 60--does that sound right?), and IVF procedures, and just accept it.

The original protocol I received from Reprofit was simply Gonal-F 150 CD2-7 with an Ovidrel trigger. I emailed them about the PCOS thing and they changed it to Gonal-F 125 CD2-7 with 0.2mg Decapeptyl trigger.

However, my current RE wants me to do a suppression cycle (BC and Lupron), then stim using Ganirelix, and use a Lupron trigger instead of HCG to reduce the risk of OHSS. She also suggested using a down-regulation protocol including Metformin. Lastly, she said absolutely no way to a fresh transfer, which is what Reprofit was on board to do.

I'm struggling with a number of health issues which include nonspecific hormonal problems the Doctors aren't able to neatly fit into boxes. 

I'm 27 and 177cm, and in May 2017 I weighed 60kg. At this time my AMH was 38.8. 

In Feb of 2018, I weighed in at 55-56kg and my AMH was 28.1. My partner and I are trying to make sense of this rapid change as all the literature we can find suggests it's one of the more stable tests and links to BMI and AMH aren't strong (from what we've read). 

Our understanding is that the level now is better as >30 is represented on our results as indicating PCOS or menopause. I do have some PCOS symptoms but didn't fit enough to achieve diagnosis, which I'm fine with but I'm now a bit panicked that either my AMH is plummeting or that I needed yo work really hard to stay at 55kg as there's a stronger correlation between AMH and BMI then we're aware of. I have been a bit more relaxed with my eating this past few months and am probably at 59-60kg. I didn't think this could cause dramatic problems but now I'm concerned.

I've only been TTC one month but I've already run into some concerning issues. I suspected things weren't going to go smoothly, for some reason I just had a gut feeling. And my husband's appointment yesterday confirmed it.

He has insanely low testosterone, lower than 100. I think his levels were around 70 last time he got them checked. I was really worried that we were going to have trouble conceiving because of this, and yesterday the endocrinologist told him that he highly doubted he could get anyone pregnant with that testosterone level. 

For some reason he wouldn't do a sperm analysis--should we insist on this? Should I encourage my husband to go to a different doctor who will do one? How do I go about doing this?

Anyways, the doctor ordered a bunch more tests for stuff like prolactin, FSH, etc. And he has to go back in a couple weeks. My husband said that the doctor told him not to bother going to an infertility clinic or get a sperm analysis yet because ""he knew it would be bad."" 

I'm feeling pretty devastated over all this but I feel like right now my main job is to support my husband, since he's the one with the medical issue. They don't even know what's causing the low testosterone yet and for all we know it could be cancer or something terrible, so I feel like I shouldn't be so fixated on not being able to have a baby.

Still, I can't help but feel very worried and sad. I'm terrified that now we're going to have a long, painful, and possibly fruitless road ahead of us. I was never optimistic about TTC because I knew that for a lot of people it doesn't go smoothly, and unfortunately my instinct may have been right.

Is this the right course of action? Should we just wait on going to an infertility clinic and go through all these tests with the endocrinologist? Could we be wasting time with the endocrinologist? What would you recommend?

I know I have not posted in a while but I finally got the phone call today from our clinic saying that we are going to be starting IVF end of April once my next period comes. I am waiting on my period right now. I was super excited to get this news this morning. The scheduling nurse went through different dates with me for possible timing. I let it sink in throughout the day and it got me a bit worked up. I have been able to steer clear of my toxic SIL since January and it has been very good for me to not have her intruding in my life and mocking my emotions. Constantly bringing up all the pregnant people that she knows and talking constantly about babies and her feigning infertility. Easter is coming up and so is my MIL's bday. I am going to have to see her at these events. I knew that and I have been worried and dreading it for the past week even before I got this phone call. To know that I might be stimming when I have to see her makes me feel ill. I have a feeling she will be announcing she is pregnant at one of these events and I cannot handle it. 

The scheduling nurse told me to plan for a likely ER around May 7th. This is where my stress really increased. My SIL has an almost 1 year old. She is throwing his bday party May 6th. I knew months ago I would find a way to not be there. My husband thinks this is terrible. I brought it up to him tonight that I am not under any circumstances going to his bday party likely days before I have to do surgery while I am priming my body for ER. I cannot be at this event with babies everywhere and with my SIL. I told my husband my mental health is more important than making a 1 year old happy. He is never going to remember that I was not there and I will make a thoughtful card and get a gift. I love my nephew even though I cannot stand his mom. I did not tell my husband that he does not have to go. I only told him that I would not be attending. I was frustrated while I was telling him this so he started to get defensive. He said that I am forcing him to lie for me when I told him that he could tell people that I was sick. I told him that what I am trying to protect (my mental health and follicles) was more important than how he felt. I wanted him to just understand that I cannot go there and leave it at that.  However this became a larger argument and he has decided he is standing up for my nephew. He said ""your aunt didn't come to your first birthday because she doesn't like your mom"". My husband then asked me to see how this makes him feel. That he will be lying for me, that I think that I can skip out on family events and that means that he should be able to skip out on my family events. I am so annoyed and very angry right now.

He cannot understand how triggered I am by my SIL. Easter is next week and I have been dreading it all week. I had nightmares 3 times this week about her announcing she is pregnant at dinner and me loosing my shit. I cannot be around her while I am doing IVF. Why is our timing so shitty? I managed to go without seeing her for months and then I have to see her 2 times the month we are going to begin. I have this horrible feeling in my gut and I hate myself for not being a better person and just letting it go and not being effected by this. I then have to see her again at the end of May for my step daughters birthday and it never seems to end. 

What would you do in my situation? I want the IVF to go well and I want to hibernate while I am going through it. I do not want outside support or our friends to know because I cannot handle all of the questions and stupid uninformed comments I will receive. I am too sensitive to filter it out.

Today we got the results of our second IVF.  None of our (very few) eggs survived to six days.

And we were so hopeful this time.  Why is the Universe so fucking unfair?  What's extra sad is that in the back of my mind, I had a feeling this wasn't going to work this time either.

This was not how either of us envisioned our lives.  My wife and I are now in our 40s.  We wanted to have children.  Other people had them so easily.  Even the other IVF couples we know.  One try, done.

This is so hard on my wife especially.  She's the one undergoing the shots and procedures.  She even put forward the idea that I find someone else to have a baby with.  I told her that I would never.

But the dread is setting in.  What if we can't have children together?  We discussed donor eggs.  But I wanted to have a child that was *ours*.  Would she feel less for a child that is not genetically hers? I have to be honest,  I'm not sure I would be okay if the shoe was on the other foot. 

What will happen?  I can't help but imagine the far future.  I don't want to live with the regret of not having children.  When we're old, will we be lonely?  Will our lives be empty?  They say without kids you can fill your lives with something else.  Travel.  Pets.  Career. But that's not us.

Travel? Where would we want to see so badly anyway?  Would trade the freedom to travel for a baby any day.

Pets?  Pets aren't people.  We will outlive our pets.  A pet will not leave even the smallest trace in the world.

Career? Its just a job.  We work to live the rest of our lives.

If we adopt, would we look at the child and think, ""not ours""? Would the child wonder who their real parents are?

We've run out the insurance for fertility treatments.  Moving forward it's all out of pocket.  One more time.  After that will we feel like we are throwing money down a hole?

I just feel so defeated right now.

I met with my RE to discuss FET plans. She recommended *one* of the diagnostic tests below prior to transfer. If I choose to go without, I would have the transfer in three weeks and start estradiol today. If I choose to have one of these tests, I would start birth control, instead. Disclaimer: everything I've written below is what my doctor said, and I didn't ask for evidence that supports her claims.

**Hysteroscopy w/scratch**: I had this done in November, and it was normal, but she recommends a repeat. She said it will prime the endometrium for implantation and dilate my cervix a bit, making the transfer easier and minimizing spasms/cramping, which can affect implantation. FET would be 4-5 weeks from now. Cost: Not sure. It was $1,100+ before, but it may be lower if I've met my deductible (my insurance covers diagnostic tests).

**Endometrial scratch only**: an alternative to the full hysteroscopy. FET would be 4-5 weeks from now. Cost: unknown, but I assume it will be less than the hysteroscopy. 

**ERA**: My clinic estimates the transfer/implantation window to be after five days of PIO, and she said that method is accurate in over 90% of their patients. ERA would pinpoint the exact number of hours I need to take PIO to reach the implantation window (e.g., 147 hours). All of her patients who have had this test have become pregnant. I'd have to do a “mock” cycle of estradiol and PIO. FET would be 7-8 weeks from now. Cost: $600

I have two frozen blasts, both of which had the highest grades. They're not PGS-tested, and she recommended I transfer both, which surprised me. Transferring one at a time would cost an extra $3,875, so that's a bonus (although it wouldn't drive the decision). I don't want to do another retrieval cycle. She said that, if I did, she'd add HGH to help all of my follicles grow evenly. It was the first time she'd mentioned it, and now I really regret not asking about HGH prior to this last cycle :(

She also said I probably have endo, based on my period symptoms, and that it could be the cause of my DOR. She recommended I talk to my GYN about it ""in between children."" Okay.

I’ve been navigating this world with lots of advice from previous posts (thank you all so much!) but I just had a very weird interaction with my clinic and wanted to know if I was the one overthinking it. 

After months of testing and waiting, we were finally approved for our first IUI. Of course this couldn’t come at a worse time - we have an upcoming three week vacation planned, plus I have a packed work schedule. I’m currently temping in a different department which doesn’t give me much flexibility for appointments, and it’s an opportunity that I couldn’t pass up. 

The clinic called me at the crack of dawn (shout-out to all my fellow night shift workers) so I was still half asleep when I talked to the nurse. When I finally woke up and came to my senses I called them back and asked if I could try something to help me ovulate, since this is the whole issue we are facing. Due to life issues we wouldn’t be able to do IUI for the next 3-4 months. 

The nurse told me that Clomid “doesn’t exist” anymore and that the clinic won’t prescribe anything without monitored cycles.

I’ve had 2 so far (not including today) one in office w/ ultrasound and on as an outpatient w/ X-ray.

The X-ray one was traumatizing. The catheter fell out 3x, the dye burned, and they couldn’t get through one of my tubes. I was writhing in the bed. I’ve had kidney stones & I would rather have them again than do another HSG.

So, I wasn’t prepared for it. For some reason the 1500 mg of Metformin I’m taking was REALLY messing with my stomach this morning, so I ran to the bathroom before she (the Dr.) got in the room.

I think she was annoyed about being held up and was kind of...rough. She’s also very new to the practice, and I have never met her before. 

Now, I work in L&D. I know how Drs. can be, depending on a number of factors. 

Long story short, we tried it 3x total. The first 2 were nightmares, she was kind of condescending about it,  It was really painful, and I wasn’t handling it well. 

She wanted to call it quits & schedule a hysteroscopy, which would set back our cycle by at least 3 months. Plus, it’s a lot more money, and if I can avoid being sedated I do (I have a condition that makes anesthesia dangerous/ makes the anesthesia team & myself really nervous.) 

I tried to politely explain that it would help if she told me what she was doing so I wouldn’t be surprised, that I had had some traumatic experiences as a patient etc. 


I asked/told her to try it one more time, and this time she numbed my cervix & it worked.  She was much nicer through the 3rd time, she told me everything  and we talked a bit after about the results (uterus is good to go for a transfer & I have about 60+ immature follicles on my ovaries. Holy PCOS Batman!) 

You guys, I wanted to cry. I’m familiar with this process, I’m familiar with clinical environments, I’m familiar with pain & being uncomfortable...but today it was just too much for a little while. 

I’m really glad that I had enough of a backbone to insert myself in the decision making process, but I feel like I shouldn’t have had to in the first place.  Also glad that I have some background & familiarity with what’s happening thanks to my job.

Yesterday was my biweekly scan. Unfortunately we found the baby passed sometime in the last week. I'm having a D&C today.

We have a long history of RPL and we've pretty much run out of treatment options. The only thing that we haven't addressed? I have, according to my specialist, a very slightly heart shaped uterus. Not truly bicornuate, no septum, just described as having ""a bit of a dip along the top"". This was checked during a previous lap/hysto when I had endo removed, and I was sent for a follow up MIR for measurement. My specialist said it wasn't significant enough to cause issues, and this was confirmed by a second doctor... but now, after our fifth loss... it's the last significant piece that could be addressed.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and had a corrective surgery? Could you please let me know what was involved and what your prognosis was following? I think my doctor mentioned yesterday that it would be relatively simple and only required cauterisation... but I was quite upset at the time and might have missed some crucial info.

(Background summary if you're curious and don't feel like scrolling through my post history: RPL with 3 spontaneous pregnancies before beginning IVF, 2 since treatment commenced 18 months ago, both PGS tested embryos. I can't seem to carry past 10 weeks. 3 x MMC requiring D&C, 2 x MC. No significant egg quality or MFI issues. Have been tested for everything. I have MFTHR (treated with clexane) and stage 1 endo which has been excised. Have done three transfers, two successful. No significant NK cells but put on intralipids and steroids for preventative just in case. Tried accupuncture. We've also done multiple uterine biopsies, scratches and mock cycles. I'm 33 and otherwise very healthy aside from having coeliac disease which has been well managed since diagnosis at age 20)

Assassination of Gianni Versace had the finale, I'm still not sure how much of this show if true, but I do dig the camp factor, and Penelope Cruz is fantastic.

Finally saw Black Panther, probably the last person to do so, it was an entertaining watch. 

Not sure why I watched this one, but Inconceivable was a really bad Nic Cage movie that somehow had the entire plot revolve around egg donation/infertility/surrogacy in a pretty messed up way. So yeah don't watch that. 

Good Doctor, no mention of the IF plot this week, and already coming up on the season finale next week. 

If anyone watched Married at first sight there's been some mention of children, and wanting to have children/how they could see having children with their new spouses. 

I watched this 2 part series on Oxygen Aaron Hernandez Uncovered which I thought was interesting. It gave a look into the murder trials and his life, and I find the stuff about CTE interesting. 

Timeless-glad this show is back, it's pretty unique and I love it, though not sure how long it'll last, given it was cancelled and now is back but not scheduled for many episodes. 

The Resident-I like this show, no real mentions of children outside the context of some of the patients are children. Matt Czuchry so handsome.   

Sister Wives-mention of pregnancy/childbirth, but coming up on the tell-all and that's always entertaining.

Downsizing-terrible movie, like 5 minutes of the movie was about the being small thing, the rest of the movie was a hot mess. My husband said it was one of the worst movies he's ever seen.

For the People-the new Shonda Rhimes show, still giving it a try, kind of too procedural so far, but will stick with for a few more episodes.

**tl;dr context:** husband (almost 38) has confirmed high OSA and high normal DFI, as well as borderline MFI. We have continued to get pregnant naturally but miscarry. I had done a full RPL panel, have had two HSGs, an endometrial biopsy, SIS, etc. We do two cycles of IVF with PGS after so many unexplained losses. First cycle -- lots of eggs, lots of high quality embryos -- then only 2 blasts beyond Day 3. Abnormal. Told it's a fluke, do a second cycle -- same amount of eggs, worse fertilization but still all excellent quality embryos until Day 3, then 4 blasts -- again, 75+% abnormals. Took a leap of faith and transferred two mosaics as they were still deemed high quality and our doctor swore by seeing healthy pregnancies despite this. Got pregnant, chemical -- 8 total losses now.

Husband has a confirmed varicocele and is getting an ultrasound in a few weeks to see whether he has more than meets the eye and does in fact need it repaired for any potential success before donor sperm (which two REs had already mentioned after these cycles). I know if he does have surgery recommended, it's still several months until the sperm are ideally better.

In the meantime, the *only* measure I have not had done is a lap. The only doctor that has mentioned it is Dr. Braverman after my phone consult with him -- but as many in the loss community know, he has his patented 'silent endometriosis' he assumes every woman with unexplained losses has. He said I should do a lap.

My AMH is 2.7, which is normal but low normal for my age, but my LH, FSH, AFC (Often 20+, ER have yielded 16 and 17 eggs respectively), etc. are all fine, my eggs were deemed fine after two ER (though I did have a slightly bigger drop off in mature eggs than expected, though still my total normal of mature eggs put me in 'normal territory,' and the RE wondered if it was a protocol issue since I stim very quickly), we have had one unassisted success at the beginning of all of this, and we do at least have a confirmed issue in all of this unexplained RPL with my husband's OSA/DFI.

Is it worth doing a lap? I have no symptoms of endo, which I know doesn't necessarily mean anything -- but if I continuously get pregnant naturally but lose them, and have had HSGS confirmed my uterus is good, would endo be affecting it? Braverman suggests endo affects egg quality, but then in my research it specifically can affect the shell of the egg affecting fertilization/*getting* pregnant, which is not our issue.

Would endo in tubes have been noticed at all during egg retrievals at all, too?

I guess I'm asking because there is just nothing else on my end to do, and I guess I'm desperately looking for something to ""get a jump"" on things. But then I looked into laps being more invasive than I thought, as well as some things showing exploratory laps are no longer recommended. And so far, no one who's been all up in my junk has suggested it. I even read that Metformin has been used to treat endo, and that NAC is even more effective than Metformin -- and I've been on that for ages just for its miscarriage reduction effects. So I feel like I've already been treating any hypothetical endo in this method, too? But again, would endo not have been seen between a SIS, two HSGS, two egg retrievals, a million ultrasounds, etc.?

[This article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivf-testing-spurs-a-debate-over-mosaic-embryos-1521644178) in today's WSJ covers the debate about PGS and mosaic embryos.

Some interesting snippets, I thought, are:

- ""Mosaic embryos weren’t easily detectable until about two years ago, when the technology for the test improved. A number of studies conclude that mosaic embryos represent about 20% of all embryos created through in-vitro fertilization.""
- ""The main risk mosaic embryos pose is miscarriage, experts say. There isn’t evidence that such embryos pose a higher risk of birth defects, they add, though larger studies are needed in order to rule that out definitively.""

<p><a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivf-testing-spurs-a-debate-over-mosaic-embryos-1521644178"">This article</a> in today&#39;s WSJ covers the debate about PGS and mosaic embryos.</p>

<p>Some interesting snippets, I thought, are:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Mosaic embryos weren’t easily detectable until about two years ago, when the technology for the test improved. A number of studies conclude that mosaic embryos represent about 20% of all embryos created through in-vitro fertilization.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The main risk mosaic embryos pose is miscarriage, experts say. There isn’t evidence that such embryos pose a higher risk of birth defects, they add, though larger studies are needed in order to rule that out definitively.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Most couples don’t want to take the risk of miscarriage that comes with implantation of a mosaic embryo.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Studies have found that a mosaic embryo develops into a healthy baby about a third of the time.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The results, Dr. Schattman says, raise the bigger question of whether the testing should be done at all. “You might biopsy an area that’s all abnormal cells and that’s the only spot with abnormal cells,” he says. “The area might be chromosomally abnormal but it doesn’t represent the rest of the embryo.”&quot;</li>

We had been planning IVF for May with donor sperm but planned to delay FET for 2 years for reasons. Turns out I may be biologically as well as “socially” infertile.

I just got my CD3 labs back and my AMH is 0.96. I’m devastated, but I know I’m preaching to the choir here. My other relevant numbers: FSH 8.16, Estrodial 50.99, AFC 17 (8 in L ovary, 9 in R ovary).

We planned to wait until after my partners CD3 labs come back to do a full consult/next steps with our RE. That won’t be for another 3 weeks at least. I’m wondering though if it would be dreadful to start taking DHEA now (I’ve already upped the Ubiquinol to 200mgs) to get a jump start on any help that might do? 

For other low AMH/DOR folks, How bad are my other numbers? From what I’ve read the FSH is high-normal, but not scary high. What can I expect
In terms of protocols for IVF? Should I ask about cancelling/restarting if I don’t respond well to the stims? We’re 100% out of pocket and we’re initially planning on only doing one ER (me because younger eggs) but now thinking that it might make more sense to do both me and my partner (depending on her numbers) if we can swing it financially (a big if), as it looks like I may not get a large number of eggs on a single retrieval. Any advice welcome. I’m feeling like everything is really high stakes now and I have to act ASAP if I want to have any chance of success.

I wanted to get your opinions on my situation.  I am 32 with normal bloodwork and my husband is 33 with a normal SA.  We have been trying since Feb 2017.  I've done 6 monitored Letrozole cycles, and added in a trigger shot for the last 3.  I just had a lap to clear one of my tubes (blocked on HSG), remove a polyp, remove scar tissue adhering my left ovary to my abdomen, and clear up mild endo.  Before that, I was really only ovulating from my right ovary, and my right tube was the blocked one.  Hopefully now that tube is open and my left ovary isn't strangled by scar tissue.
Here's my question:  What would you do before you moved onto IVF?  (Contraindicated by the fact that I'm a teacher, so doing IVF during the summer would be preferable.)  My plan as of right now is that I just did one unmedicated cycle (still in the 2ww), then I'll do IUI's in April and May.  At that point I was thinking of moving on to IVF.  Right now I'm planning on flying up to CNY to afford it.  I'd have egg retrieval during June, and transfer during July.  Best case scenario, I don't have to miss any school, and I can save my days for maternity leave.  But... am I giving it enough time to work after my lap?  Would that be moving to IVF too soon?  I could do one more IUI during June, but it's risky because I'd be trying to fit everything into July, and may end up having to travel for transfer the first month of school.

Hey guys. 
I had my retrieval done on Friday morning. They got 19 eggs, injected 16 and currently 14 are fertilised and growing away. 

But my question is this- how long am I meant to be in pain? They told me I’d only need the surgery day off but now it’s Sunday morning and I’m still quite sore. I laughed earlier and my uterus nearly flew out of my belly button!

I had my retrieval done on Friday morning. They got 19 eggs, injected 16 and currently 14 are fertilised and growing away. </p>

<p>But my question is this- how long am I meant to be in pain? They told me I’d only need the surgery day off but now it’s Sunday morning and I’m still quite sore. I laughed earlier and my uterus nearly flew out of my belly button! </p>

So, I don't really know where this post is going. It's just been a stressful week and I feel like I need to rant a bit. 

My husband and I have been ttc for 3 years. My employer has very shitty insurance so everything is pretty much straight out of our pockets, including our first $18k ivf attempt in October that failed.  Still paying off the loan for that. 

We are emotionally and physically prepared to try 1 more time before switching gears to either adoption/fostering/child free. That being said, I don't want to drain our entire savings account/take out another loan/miss out on vacations solely for an attempt at having a child. Again, mind you. Already did that once. 

Since I'm not a big fan of my job (I'm in fashion marketing, but not a fan of my specific employer) I scoured the internet for countless hours looking for articles or message boards with people sharing companies that cover IVF. 

I applied to everything I could, and low and behold I'm in the final interview stages with such a company. They would cover1 full cycle with medications included, saving us about 15k-20k. 

Would I want to work here if it weren't for the IVF coverage? Probably not, but it seems like a nice place overall and it's a Fortune 50 company that would have lots of upward mobility opportunities. 

ALL IN ALL, my main point here is, how did I get to this point? Is this crazy? Relentlessly applying for jobs solely because of the ivf coverage? 

It's really just making me reflect on all the crazy things we do for a CHANCE at a baby. It's not fair, it's not right, it's not deserved. It's wild that my life has even come to this point.

I didn't do it willingly but I had a dermoid cyst the size of an orange that could burst at anytime. I found a God-fearing doctor who I love and trust but was still terrified of surgery. They said they could address endo if they found any. I was convinced I had endo since no one could fine any other reason for infertility. 

I read a lot about the surgery beforehand since I was so nervous. This was a good thing because I was prepared for everything! I bought AZO for the catheter effects, gasx, stool softener, suppositories, Motrin, heating pad, pillow, blanket, tall socks, iPad, Chargers, magazines, pads.

My surgery was on a Monday so I got the call the Friday before with the time. I got my doctor and the anesthesiologist a gift (my life was in their hands and I figured they'd be less likely to kill me or make a mistake). I arrived at 7:30am for a 9:30am surgery. The nurse who greeted me was so nice and so kind and she knew I was nervous. She couldn't have been better and I thank God for her! They made me put on the hospital gown and the hospital socks (I couldn't wear my cute socks! Boo!) then I waited and listened to worship music somehow hoping it would be cancelled. 

I have a severe anxiety and panic disorder which affects everything I do in life and this was my first surgery so I kept thinking ""what if I never wake up!"". All of these thoughts surrounded me but I just kept thinking maybe it will get cancelled. I finally met the anesthesiologist around 9:15 and he was super nice and I told him I was going to be his first patient that ever ran away in a hospital gown! He was laughing but I told him I was seriously nervous and he said ""ok I will give you something for the anxiety""!

Well that trickster gave me the actual anesthesia lol. So I don't remember anything after that point and to be honest I'm happy about that! I didn't want that ever dreaded countdown you see on tv! 

So I remember nothing much else except waking up absolutely freezing! Like I was in narnia! With no wardrobe! I was begging the nurses to please please get me warm blankets! They put ten on me and my teeth were still chattering like crazy! They said they never had anyone use that many blankets before!

I got wheeled to my room and was in a daze but still funtional. They tried to make me eat but I lost all of my appetite and I was just thrilled it was over! I was thanking God while shivering and being happy and in a daze.

I then was for some reason convinced I had to use the restroom before they would let me leave. So I got up and my husband helped me walk literally ten feet and my blood pressure dropped and to the ground I went! The nurse was extremely upset asking why I would get out of bed and I could've really hurt myself! I wasn't very coherent but still in a fuzzy daze. It wasn't a scary daze, it actually felt great! 

After that point, the nurse gave me a bed pan and asked me to try to go. It was several hours after the surgery at this point. I could not go. At all! Like at all! After a half hour she comes back and asks if I want a warm glass of water to run there to make it easier. I said yes and tried that and still nothing! For some reason I was very patient and just said I'll take my time even if it takes me hours! Finally I was able to go but the nurse wanted to put another IV in me since I was still dizzy. 

I got to leave the hospital around 6pm. The car ride was hard bc it was long about 45 mins, all of the bumps I wanted to cry at. Finally I got home and walking from the car to my house was a real challenge as I felt super weak and my teeth started chattering again. I fell asleep and the past few days have been a giant fuzz ball. 

Two things I weren't anticipating include how cold I was after the surgery and the amount of dizziness I'd have days after. I forgot to eat and the nurse said it's very important with the Percocet to eat bc your blood sugar drops and I had a scary moment yesterday. Overall it's been good but I just really hope the dizziness goes away soon bc I still cannot stand for more than a few seconds and it's Friday and the surgery was on Monday. I recommend this surgery for all who are scared and have an anxiety disorder. Don't worry it will go better than expected just make sure you have a good team of doctors!!

Some background: She is in her mid-20s, no kids, but she has donated a few times before always resulting in 25-27 eggs. Only one cycle allowed us to get results (5 PGS normal embryos from 25 eggs). There is no pregnancy info due to HIPAA. I chose her because she seems so much like me and I was immediately drawn to her profile.

She had a screening back in January for a cycle she will be doing after ours. Her follicle count was 32 and AMH was 5.5. The doctor said this looked great and we moved forward with her screening for our clinic about a month later. They anticipated it being a quick screening and about on par with the previous month's results.

The nurse called recently and said the doctor noted her follicle count as 13!! I am in shock. The nurse said the doctor is ""not thrilled"" but wants to wait and see what AMH comes back as. I would think if follicle count was 13, AMH shouldn't be incredibly high...certainly not 5.5.

This has me second guessing everything and asking WTF!! Has anyone seen this before? Her screening in January was done at a very reputable clinic and LabCorp did her AMH analysis.

I am 31 yrs old and I have Kallmann Syndrome and get my periods only on birth control pills. I always knew that having babies would be a huge issue for me. I just started treatment with menopur injections and Ovidrel trigger shot with timed intercourse. My husband’s semen analysis is perfectly normal. My RE and OB-GYN seems confident about my chances. My first cycle didn’t work out and I was a complete mess after that.

All those progesterone suppositories tricked me into thinking that I had pregnancy symptoms and then my period showed up. On top this, my uterus is also smaller than average because I never ovulated on my own and it didn’t receive the proper exposure to estrogen that a healthy woman should have received. My doctors doesn’t seem to think this is an issue and they said the uterus will grow once I get pregnant.

294,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi there, I've been lurking around for about a week after finally meeting with a fertility specialist the other week. I'm happy to discover this sub as TFAB was starting to hurt.

A bit of background: Partner and I are both 30, we've been trying for about 2 years with nothing but 3 early miscarriages to show for it.

The last couple of weeks have been really tough. After seeing an RE, I got my period a few days after, confirming another failed Clomid cycle. Last weekend, we went to a church service for a departed family member. There were at least 4, maybe 5 pregnant women there, and it made me a little sad, but I thought, no big deal, I'll be fine.

At the end of the service they had a blessing for all the pregnant women expecting babies for safe delivery. They all stood up and walked to the front of the church for a ""special blessing,"" while I got to sit there and contemplate how I'm not pregnant again. 

Holy shit that hurt. I didn't think it would hurt so much to see that, but it did. I guess fortunately (?) it looked like I was just grieving for the departed family member, but really my heart was broken for myself and my husband.

One of the pregnant family members had her baby last Friday, at the same facility I was going for an HSG test. I had planned on going to see her after but I couldn't do it. :( 

I think I have to suck it up and see them today. I *am* happy for them, but it just hurts. 

I'm happy I found this subreddit.

<p>A bit of background: Partner and I are both 30, we&#39;ve been trying for about 2 years with nothing but 3 early miscarriages to show for it.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks have been really tough. After seeing an RE, I got my period a few days after, confirming another failed Clomid cycle. Last weekend, we went to a church service for a departed family member. There were at least 4, maybe 5 pregnant women there, and it made me a little sad, but I thought, no big deal, I&#39;ll be fine.</p>

<p>At the end of the service they had a blessing for all the pregnant women expecting babies for safe delivery. They all stood up and walked to the front of the church for a &quot;special blessing,&quot; while I got to sit there and contemplate how I&#39;m not pregnant again. </p>

<p>Holy shit that hurt. I didn&#39;t think it would hurt so much to see that, but it did. I guess fortunately (?) it looked like I was just grieving for the departed family member, but really my heart was broken for myself and my husband.</p>

We've got 3 more PGS normals and 3 mosaics that are okay to try. We did karyotype testing before we started. Husband's SA was totally normal, we're at IVF because of my stubborn PCOS ovaries but managed to get 6 good quality PGS normals. 

I'm on Metformin for the PCOS, which brought my testosterone down into a normal range, but DHEA-S was still high (but much improved at least). Also on synthroid for slightly elevated TSH, but that's in range now as well. 

For transfers we add Medrol and baby aspirin when I start the progesterone, and a week of antibiotics as well. I downreg with bcp, then I do .5mL IM estradiol twice a week and 1mL PIO a day for a couple days, increasing to twice a day.

We started with a mock cycle with a biopsy that came back normal/receptive. We've done several saline sonograms, and the last one after the miscarriage turned up a small polyp that was removed by hysteroscopy before our most recent transfer. Uterus is normal shape, tubes are open.

The transfers have all gone really smoothly. He never has any trouble getting the catheters in.

Miscarriage was possibly (my guess) caused by a SCH because I had a random bleed that precipitated everything, but it was really too early to tell what was going on since we never had a chance to see a fetal pole or heart beat.

I'm 35, 5'7"" 127lbs, active, nonsmoker, no significant medical history. I'm... shocked to say the least. My husband and I have been TTC for 8 months, with one unconfirmed CP (positive on FRER, didn't get a chance to do betas before I lost it. I think it implanted at 13-14 DPO, though). All other tests: HSG, semen analysis, LH, and FSH were normal. LH was 3.8 and FSH 5.3.

My OBGYN says my low AMH means I have few eggs left and they're low quality, making conceiving naturally unlikely. He recommended IVF but said I could try 3 rounds of Clomid first, since it's so much less expensive. His offer sounded perhaps more conciliatory than actually medically-driven (I was obviously upset at hearing I should be doing IVF yesterday), like, ""well... I mean, I guess we COULD try Clomid...""

I'm reading online that Clomid doesn't help women over 35 with low ovarian reserve. I read that its anti-estrogen and pro-testosterone effects can make pregnancy even less likely for women with low ovarian reserve. I read that the chances of conceiving naturally even with low ovarian reserve are greater than conceiving on Clomid and low ovarian reserve. I read that many fertility clinics won't even do IVF on women with very low ovarian reserve, because what's the point of trying to retrieve something that's not there anymore. At the same time, most of this reading is being done on either fertility clinic or natural fertility websites, which, I don't know, seems kind of similar to checking the General Mills site to research the nutritional value of Lucky Charms.

I don't know what to do or think. I feel numb. OBGYN says this is why I'm not pregnant, but I'm just... I don't know. In denial? It's one lab test, and everything else was normal. My FSH and LH are fine. I've been tracking my cycles for 8 months with Ava and Clear Blue Digital OPKs. I seem to be ovulating every month (LH rise, EWCM, proceeding temp rise) with a LP of 11-13 days.

I ordered this online fertility test kit (Modern Fertility - obviously you still have to go in to a lab for the blood draw) to, I guess, double-check that my AMH is really this low. I'm supposed to call my OBGYN and go in for Clomid and antral follicle count at the start of my next cycle. I feel numb, despairing, and in denial all at the same time. Does anyone have any advice for me?

I guess in a way this is an introduction post.

Update: y'all have convinced me, I made an app with a RE I found on infertilityiq for next month, after the results from my next self-funded round of CD3 labs are in (or should be in).

<p>I am a first time poster on this subreddit. I had some CD3 labs done for menstrual irregularities (I know they are commonly done for fertility issues which why is why I am posting here), but don&#39;t see the Dr for 2 weeks. I think they are normal, but would love if someone could confirm. Any thoughts?</p>
