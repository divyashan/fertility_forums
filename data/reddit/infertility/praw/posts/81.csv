Surrogacy. Lets just say for example a friend will carry our child. Lets say this friend has a good PPO with coverage for pregnancy. Obviously, ours which is basically the same insurance, does in fact cover IVF for this but, as it states, does not cover surrogacy costs.

Basically, will it be like a normal pregnancy for them in terms of their insurance? Obviously we will look further into this, but I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this and if they could help me here.

I have a bunch of brand new unopened boxes of Gonal-F.  The expiration is the end of September.  I would be needing it the first two weeks of October.

<p>I know no one can tell me it’s fine past the expiration, but it’s only about a week off so I’m on the edge about it.  It seems like it might be fine to still use.  It would save a lot of money obviously.  Does anyone have any advice?  I’m kind of assuming if I ask the nurse/doctor they’ll just say no, but I can also ask their opinion just to see what they say. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Edit- thank you all for your answers and thoughts!!!  I think I’ll see what the prices are and how much it would end up saving and make my decision when it gets closer.  The unopened boxes have been in a consistently air conditioned house but not in the fridge (for about a month) so I don’t know if that might have spoiled them??  If it doesn’t cost too much to buy more, I’ll probably end up doing that for peace of mind.  But if it’s like $4,000 or something, I may use what I have since it’ll only be a week off expiration.</p>

I see a lot of questions on here about managing constipation around ER and other procedures where one gets constipating drugs (opioids etc). I thought this info might help, partially because I see so many people using Colace/docusate, which very likely to be unhelpful.

OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL MEDICAL ADVICE AND YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE BEFORE TAKING MEDICATIONS! 

Editing to add- once you're post transfer, please disregard all of this because the rules for what laxatives are ok are strict when you are/may be pregnant. Don't want to cause uterine contractions.

Osmotic laxatives (cause the gut to retain water):

-Poly ethylene glycol/PEG/ Miralax (usually very well tolerated, flavorless powder you can mix in any liquid, somewhat expensive)

-Milk of magnesia

-Magnesium citrate (nuclear option)

-Lactulose (gross taste)

-Sorbitol (gross taste)

 

Stimulant laxatives: (speeds the movement of stool through the gut):

-Senna (sennosides) Usually 1-2 tabs (8.6 mg) at bedtime will cause BM in the AM, but can go up to 2-4 tablets twice a day. Can also get senna tea (smooth move) but it is unpredictable. Senna can definitely cause cramping

-Bisacodyl (dulcolax)- available as tablets or suppository. A suppository can be very intense but usually can produce a stool in about 30 minutes.

Bulk forming laxatives- fiber supplements- only work if you are very very hydrated and definitely can make things worse in some people, especially if constipation is drug induced. 

Tips: 
A good starting point is 1-2 senna at night. Miralax is probably the most gentle but effective if you are worried about cramping.  Sometimes you need to mix an osmotic and a stimulant laxative to get results if you are really backed up. A bisacodyl suppository will work quickly most of the time but it may cause short term but significant cramps.  Sometimes a tap water or fleets enema is needed to open the flood gates.

A word about docusate (Colace): there is no evidence that it provides any benefit when compared to placebo. It is a very commonly recommended and used medication but almost any guideline you read recommends against using it at all (not that it will hurt, expect if you are relying on it to manage constipation).

However I am infertile despite what people keep telling me on the social platforms I keep trying to post on. So prepare yourselves for a long post, I’m going to include every detail to deal with that. 
I am 36, my husband is 40, we have been trying since October.  I was born with 2 neurological conditions. Agenisis of the Corpus Callosum and Dandy Walkers Syndrome. Basically I don’t have the part of my brain that deals with communication between the halves and in the spot where it should be I have a big cyst. ( this will be important later). 
In February I went to see my now former midwife. My cycle was coming on inconsistent days, not lasting the same amount of time and was crazy heavy. She sent me in for some bloodwork, and then an ultrasound. After the results I was sent in for an MRI. I was pretty upset, because a bunch of the test scheduling and whatever was done over the phone with the nurse, who refused to tell me anything. After the MRI results I got a phone call saying well we think you need surgery on your brain so you need to see a neurologist. Wouldn’t tell me anything else. I saw the neurologist in March who said what? It’s your pituitary gland not the Neuro. Issues you were born with that are the issue. You need to see an endocrinologist. So I got an appointment with him in April. Cue me also saying goodbye midwife hello Obgyn at a different office.  
So I wait a few weeks and see the endocrinologist and then the next day have my appointment with the new Obgyn. The endo. Puts me on Bromocriptine because apparently I have a non cancerous tumor on my pituitary gland that is screwing with my prolactin levels. The new Obgyn wants to start trying to figure out why I’m having problems with having me have an ultrasound. So I get that, and basically I’m told that I need to give the bromocriptine a chance to work, but I should also have a HSG test done as well. That happens at the beginning of July. It was clear. Then they have my husband get tested. He is fine. At the end of July they have me get another ultrasound that shows I’m ovulating (yay!). And more blood work- although why was not clear, as it was the same stuff the endo. Has me get done every month. The endocrinologist has told me when I saw him that if I wasn’t pregnant by September I needed to go to a fertility clinic. I get the appointment set up, send for my records from my offices. Then I get a phone call from my Obgyn office. And they are PISSED. Why are you going there you haven’t had a full work up yet! I said ok, let’s do more then. They schedule more blood tests ( which I later discovered was a grand total of 1).  It was for my FSH- they referred to it by its entire name though Follicle Stimulating Hormone. It’s at a 0.5. So it’s too low. Now they want to do yet another ultrasound, on the fifth day of my cycle, which is a day that I have had it done before.  And then they will decide what meds to put me on if any. I canceled my fertility clinic appointment because they made it seem like they wanted to do a lot of tests, when they only did one. They are telling me the meds I need for the FSH are cheap if my insurance won’t cover it, but refuse to prescribe them until after this redundant ultrasound happens- which is at least 10 days away.  I’m starting to wonder if they just want my money and to drag this out rather than oh I don’t know fix it so I can get pregnant. So now I’m at a loss as to what to do except when I go there  and lose my temper because they just want to horse around.  I’m not even sure what to ask anymore- I was planning on pointing out that have course hair growing on my chin- which a woman of my age should not have.

It turned out my husband had low motility and we started Vitamin C regimen I found a study on and a few months later I was pregnant. I had to have surgery and while it had ruptured they left the tube in to see if it would heal. Post surgery they told me that they found signs of endometriosis.

Fast forward months later we moved so had to start over with new docs. OB ordered HSG which showed “not definite spillage” into the left ovary through the tube but right is normal. My OB immediately referred me to a private fertility clinic telling me IVF should work fine.

We realize the AM/PM distinction doesn't work for every timezone, just use the most recently posted one (you can sort the sub by ""new"" to find this easily).  It also helps tremendously if you upvote the daily threads when you see them so they stay at the top of the sub making them easier for others to find.

The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or treatment related questions.  It's a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help.

The Chat threads are for anything and everything not related to Active treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won't stop asking about when you're having kids? Funny story? Rant? These all go in the Chat thread. This is a great place to get to know fellow members outside of their treatment or diagnosis.   

Have a question that you think might warrant a standalone post or doesn't fit in the active/chat threads?  Try the FAQ/Wiki first!  https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index  We have archived posts covering getting started, what all those acronyms mean, what we wish we knew ahead of time, individual experiences with ALL the medications, treatment options, common protocols, procedures, paying for treatment, past AMA archives, hunger games data... there's a lot of information there!

Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. Questions phrased like ""has anyone else tried clomid?!"" are not generally well received. There are over 10,000 subscribers here with the majority having gone through several different courses of treatment.  Use specific titles for your posts to make them more easily searched by users.

Going with the understanding we dont want this to be our journey, and kudos to everyone who goes through this over and over again but we decided that was not for us, and the physical/emotional toll it was taking on my wife was something she did not want to spend years doing.  So one more try and then take a break, possibly forever, and live a life without children. (I’m 37, she’s 32, TTC for a year without help plus a year with help, 2 failed IUIs, and now 2 failed IVFs).

We were doing a coculture protocol this time around, as we were told that they wanted to try that method because some eggs dont do well growing outside of the womb, so they would biopsy some of my wife’s endometrium and grow the eggs they retrieved in that for better results. Liked that they werent doing the same thing twice, seemed like a learning/diagnostic process, made sense to me. 

So we do the stimming, she gets the biopsy, all of that fun stuff, goes for the egg retrieval yesterday, they get 11 eggs. Not a bad number i think, hoping all we need is one to work.

During my hysterosalpingogram (HSG),  sonohysterography (SHG), and IUIs I have experienced blinding pain. I have no problems with pap smears and the pain does not start until something enters my uterus. I do not have blocked tubes, I do not have endometriosis.

I feel a sharp pain, far more than a cramp, after the catheter enters my uterus. It hurts, but I can grit my teeth and get through it. The fluid, however, causes unbelievable pain the second it enters. The pain is so shocking and so bad I literally remember nothing else from those moments. I scream, have shouted expletives and my whole body convulses (per my husband). The SHG did show my uterus contracting during the test.

I would greatly appreciate any insight from anyone who has experienced anything similar without blocked tubes. I do not have a low pain tolerance, I barely felt all my stimulation shots.

So, I've been trying to get pregnant the last 5 years. I've had an exploratory surgery done to check for endomitriosis, PCOS, Fibroids etc 4 years ago and my doctor said there was nothing wrong with me. Turns out he failed to note a few things. He retired and I have a new obgyn now. She told me i have a condition where my uterine wall has pretty much threaded into my muscles and is causing severe periods. My last period lasted for 6 months with no end in sight. Period before that was about 8 months, 4 months before that one and close to 7 before that. I get about a 2-3 week break between them. I haven't had one for 1.5 years now cause they have me on 15mg Provera daily. 

They also found some cysts on my ovaries but she said there wasn't enough to classify it as PCOS. 

Top it off with having a heart shaped uterus, and a pretty bad one at that. There's a almost full divide between the two sides. She said this puts me at a massive risk of miscarriage, low birth weights, early labor etc. 

Has anyone had any issues like this? Is it worth investing money into to try to have a kid? I'm not even sure where to start... would my prolonged periods give me issues when trying Clomid or IUIs? Or should I try to skip straight to IVF.

I'm going to see a fertility specialist next week to see if there's any kind of surgery I can get on my uterus and go from there but any opinions here would be great. Just feel like I'm at a loss and the in laws and my parents have been mentioning grandkids a lot lately and it's heart breaking to just tell them I'll consider it at some point. 

Edit: forgot to add that my gyno suggested getting a hysterectomy due to the severity of the bleeding. There's no treatments for it. It's either stay on the Provera indefinitely or have a hysterectomy to fix it. :/

I’m 35 and my husband is 39. We’ve been trying to conceive for 2.5 years. My husband is in the military so we see a OBGYN at a military hospital. 

I’ve done blood work, ovulation tests, HSG, ultrasound for ovarian reserves, and everything came back normal. I have a 26-28 day cycle that comes regularly every month. 

———————————————

My husband saw a urologist separately. His blood and hormone levels were normal
 but he was found to have low sperm count. He took 3 semen analyses total over a year. The first semen analysis came back pretty bad, so they had him do a second one after 3 months (after changing some lifestyle habits: switching to boxers, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, taking multivitamins). The second semen analyses was improved but still considered to be low sperm count, so the urologist had my husband take Clomid for 3 months to see if it would improve the next semen analysis. It didn’t. The third semen analyses came back the same as the second so the Clomid didn’t do anything. 

Here are his numbers for reference:

First semen analysis:

Volume: 4
Concentration: 2.4
Motility: 12
Morphology: 4
Total motile: 1.2 million 

Second semen analyses:

Volume: 3.6
Concentration: 8.8
Motility: 36
Morphology: 3
Total motile: 11 million


The third semen analyses had pretty much the same number as the second

——————————

Today I saw my OBGYN. I was ready to try IUI. However, the OBGYN reviewed all of our information and she was adamant that we go straight to IVF. She said we don’t qualify for IUI because my husbands sperm count is too low. She said he needs at least 10 million total motile. I didn’t have my husbands lab work with me so I just took her word for it at the appointment. 

However, when I went home I reviewed my husbands semen analyses. On the most recent two analyses, my husbands sperm count came back as 11 million total motile. My OBGYN said my husband needs at least 10 million so he does have enough for IUI. Also, when my husband talked to the urologist, the urologist told him he could do IUI. 

So why is my OBGYN pushing me to do IVF?  As a military doctor, I think she is salaried thus doesn’t make extra for pushing expensive services. Maybe she wants to push for more aggressive treatments so the success rate will be higher, thus improving her “numbers”?  Or maybe she is simply biased towards IVF based on her experience?

More importantly, I’d like to know what  would you do if you were in my situation?  Would you go straight to IVF?  I don’t like the idea of injecting all these hormones into my body unless it’s a last resort. Also, I’ve read there is a slight increase of birth defects associated with IVF (due to the hormone injections and implanting multiple embryos). 

This is obviously the first time I’ve gone through this and I really am at a loss on what to do. I would like to have 2 kids, so I can see the advantage of jumping straight to IVF to not waste anymore time as I’m already 35. But if there is a chance of conceiving with IUI, I don’t know why my OBGYN is pushing me to do IVF right away.",t2_2dkm6nmc,False,,0,False,Why is my OBGYN pushing me to go straight to IVF?

-IVF 2: same protocol and was cancelled

-IVF 3: new protocol adding in HGH, 8 retrieved, two made it to day 5, transferred a 4AB, froze a 4CA, ended in chemical 

After meeting with our re she said there is some evidence that suggests a frozen transfer might have better success rates because my body wouldn’t be so pumped up with hormones.

What I’m struggling with is what to do with our next IVF. We plan to send any frozen embryos to get PGS testing. The embryo testing financially makes more sense to send 5 at a time but idk about waiting that long as well.

105,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I wrote up something similar a long time ago in response to a question but can’t find it now so I thought I’d (try) to do it again as a stand alone. Having been through 10+ FET protocols I feel like I have a pretty good idea how this goes, and people often ask what FET protocols can or do look like.

I’m going to start with a quick, simple primer on the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle has three phases: follicular, ovulation, and luteal. Each one is dominated by a specific hormone(s) and FET protocols intend to mimic or manipulate one or all of them.

**Menstrual Cycle Overview**

*Follicular phase* is roughly the first half of your menstrual cycle. Textbook is 14 days. It starts with the first day of menses and ends with ovulation. This phase is dominated by Estrogen (E2) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH). The production of FSH causes follicle(s) to begin growing and in turn create Estrogen. The increasing estrogen causes the endometrial lining to begin to thicken.

Mid-cycle Luteinizing Hormone spikes, causing the egg(s) to mature and release. This is *ovulation* and what I’m calling the second “phase”. Estrogen, LH, and FSH drop at this point and through the next phase.

The final phase is the *Luteal phase* which is textbook 14 days as well and dominated by Progesterone (P4). The empty follicle (now called a corpus luteum) causes Progesterone to be secreted which causes the endometrial lining to compact and become receptive. Textbook would be receptive on day 19, after 5 days of progesterone exposure.

If the egg is not fertilized, does not form and embryo, and does not implant, progesterone levels will begin to drop which causes the endometrial lining to deteriorate and shed which starts the follicular phase again. If an embryo is formed and implanted during the luteal phase, progesterone levels will remain elevated and begin to increase along with estrogen (again). At roughly 24 days, HCG will begin to increase to detectable levels.

**Transfer Process**

There are effectively four phases or steps to a frozen embryo transfer.  It’s slightly similar for a fresh, but lining growth happens as a response to the stims medications and ovulation is simulated by the trigger and egg retrieval.

The first step is *down regulation or suppression*. This serves a similar purpose as for retrievals and is most commonly done with BCP, Lupron, or both. This is effectively not necessary, but may infer some benefits such as better insurance that natural ovulation won't occur and scheduling.  A natural start is also an option just like for stims.

The second step is *lining growth* to emulate the follicular phase of a natural cycle. This is done by introducing estrogen for a medicated cycle whether or not down regulation or suppression was also used because and will have the effect of “shutting down” the natural cycle. If a natural start was used, medication can be used to supplement the natural cycle or to stimulate it for a stronger response. Medicated cycles use exogenous (outside the body) estrogen sources which can be taken intramuscularly, vaginally, orally, transdermal or any combination of the former. Vaginal and oral seem to be the most common for the ease of administration. “Natural” cycles use endogenous (inside the body) estrogen sources which can be stimulated with Clomid, Femara, stims, or the unmodified natural response. Some folks, myself included, refer to the modified natural cycles as “semi-natural”.  Sometimes exogenous estrogen can still be added to a natural cycle particularly if an ovulation inducing medication is used.

*Ovulation* is the third step and if the natural cycle was “shut down” trigger isn't necessary since there will be no follicle growth. If the cycle is natural or semi-natural then ovulation may simply be tracked with OPKs, a trigger may still be used, or both – just to cover all bases an ensure timing of progesterone exposure.

The last step is emulation of the luteal phase to cause the *lining to compact and become receptive* to implantation. Again, if the natural cycle was “shut down” this must be medicated with the introduction of exogenous progesterone. Progesterone can be administered intramuscularly, orally, or vaginally with gels, suppositories, or creams. The most common is intramuscularly and/or vaginally. If a natural or semi-natural cycle, then the naturally occurring endogenous progesterone may be enough or it may be supplemented with exogenous progesterone.  Some clinics test levels to determine if supplementation is necessary, but most seem to just add it as you can’t have too much progesterone.

**Some things to note**

It’s not uncommon for there to be other adjuncts to a transfer protocol. Adjuncts tend to fall in to two categories. First are those aimed at either increasing endometrial growth through increased blood flow (pentoxifylline, Vit E, Viagra) or hormonal sensitivity (Tamoxifen). My thin lining post talks about these more. Second are those aimed at increasing the likelihood of implantation and are most commonly antibiotics and/or steroids. Steroids (like prednisone) are believed to depress the immune system causing the body to be less likely to view the embryo as an invader.  Antibiotics are to address known, or the possibility of, subclinical infections that would cause the body to reject implantation.

Lastly! There was a study recently published that demonstrated that in a medicated cycle, PIO every 3 days in conjunction with progesterone suppositories is *as effective* as PIO every day with out suppositories BUT showed that s*uppositories alone had a lower success rate* than the protocols with PIO. Not all clinics are up to date on this yet so it’s something you might want to address. If your clinic is a PIO every day then you could save yourself some ass shots.  If your clinic is suppositories only, it may be decreasing your success rate.  The study *did not evaluate* natural or semi-natural cycles. It’s believed that in natural or semi-natural cycles that any progesterone supplementation is really “extra” so how the progesterone is administered is less critical.

Hope that helps folks understand the mechanics and options for transfer protocols a bit better.

https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cqkzjq/my_ivm_plan/

So what actually has happened is as follows:

I was booked in for a scan and bloods for my expected CD1 after coming off birth control. CD1 didn't show, but bloods were baseline so we carried on as if it was CD1. The nurse did an antral follicle count, counting anything 4mm or above. I had 57.

CD2 I started gonal F injections of 150 daily.

CD3 my period finally showed up

CD 6 I had another blood and scans. I am unsure of follicle count at this point as I had a stomach virus and was focusing more on not throwing up during the scan. I got a call that afternoon to continue injections until CD8, and come in for a scan on CD9, but no gonal f after CD8. Retrieval would likely be CD 10, potentially CD11.

CD9 scan showed roughly 50 follicles of 7mm or above (up to 11mm). The ideal range for retrieval is 10-12mm. 10ml blood was taken for the maturation serum and I was booked for a retrieval the next day.

CD10 retrieval. About 35-40 follicles in the required measurements, and 33 eggs retrieved.

CD11 we got the call with maturation rates. We were expecting low 20s, however only 13 matured. All have been injected using ICSI and we will get fertilisation rates tomorrow.

I know 13 is a decent number, but our much lower than average maturation rate has been quite disheartening. 

IVM retrievals involve a lot more piercing by the needle, so recovery is expected to be more painful from that perspective, but not OHSS so easier from that perspective. My oestrogen was also very high (over 5000) so I pretty much slept and felt sick the rest of the day. Today I'm tired but just using a heat pack and paracetamol and will go back to work tomorrow.

From this point on it's standard hunger games so I will stick to the dailies. I hope this helps anyone looking at IVM now or in the future.

Edit: Hunger games results. Of the 13 matured, 12 fertilised normally. 10 made it to day 3, but only 7 of fair quality. Quite a few had fragmentation. Day 5 we had 3 for freeze. 1 excellent hatching blast, 1 very good hatching, and 1 very good normal. 

2 are being let to go to day 6 to see if they can improve enough to freeze.

Not only does it help us to get to know one another, it helps us with context when it comes to replying to one another’s comments or queries.  For example, you may give different advice to someone who’s 23 with PCOS doing their first IUI than you would someone who’s 40 with DOR doing IVF. The unsolicited mentions of children/succes rule includes flair - keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.  Acronyms are especially common in user flair.  You can find the not-so-secret decoder ring here: https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/acronyms.

We discourage the use of ""TTC #"" in user flair for all users.  The sub supports members with primary and secondary infertility and feel that if secondary members are discouraged from using ""TTC #2"" taxonomy because it violates the casual mention of living children rule that the same guidance should apply to all members.  We discourage pain olympics whether you are trying to conceive your first or your forty-second child.

The flair can be set to only show on this sub.  To set flair you can login to the sub on a browser.

135,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I learned something VERY interesting about HSA (vs FSA) strategies today in terms of tax law/financial planning - searched the sub and found a few posts that ask questions about it but not something that addresses exactly what I'm going to write - with 2020 open enrollment coming up in a few months, this might be a helpful long term strategy for someone out there.

**FSA**

FSA accounts have been around forever and most are familiar with them.

Pros: Money is available immediately i.e. if you elect $2000 for the year, that entire sum of money is immediately available on Jan 1st to be used. Pretax money as well, the main draw for this. Most insurance plans offer the FSA even if they don't cover infertility treatment directly.

Cons: Money must be used within the defined year/grace period going into the next year or must be forfeited. This is the main drawback, and you must decide what you want to put in for the next year during open enrollment.

Good for: People who want to use the money immediately for treatment that year for things insurance won't directly cover, essentially giving you your tax bracket worth of discount.

**HSA**

This is more uncommon, and more complicated, but offers a MAJOR financial planning loophole because you can invest the balance like a retirement account - I've had an HSA and have been investing the balance since last year, but was absolutely floored this weekend when I learned that you don't actually have to reimburse yourself for expenses within the same year - you could do it years into the future, after the account has hypothetically made hundreds of thousands of dollars of easy, passive money in investment returns. While tax rules can always change, this absurd loophole will likely remain since lawmakers will want to utilize this for themselves.

HSAs are also pretax, and also must be decided upon during the previous year's open enrollment. However, there are additional rules.

1. You **must** be on a high deductible insurance plan. This can be a dealbreaker for many depending on what your other healthcare needs and expenses are beyond infertility treatment, but if your insurance isn't covering treatment anyway and you don't really have other healthcare costs, this strategy is available to you.
2. Your employer does not need to directly offer an HSA plan. You can enroll in your own HSA plan (through things like Lively, Fidelity, HSABank, etc.) and get the actual tax deduction when you file your taxes. However, many large employers do offer an HSA plan of their own as a far more convenient paycheck deduction, and some companies will actually contribute a few hundred dollars of matching along the way as compensation for the higher deductible/copays. (Mine allows for a $2900 contribution per each half of a couple on the insurance plan, +$500 of employer matching. My husband and I are not on the same insurance plan right now, meaning I get $3400 of HSA money of which $2900 is actually my contribution, and he can do the same thing for himself through his own plan. If you are on the same plan, the contribution limit is \~$7000 per family per year, pretax, and not all of that contribution is necessarily from you.)
3. The money is NOT available as a lump sum on Jan 1st if you do it through your employer. It accrues over the course of the year as a small quantity per paycheck. If you make your own HSA on Jan 1st as a lump sum, then yes, it would be available.
4. The money does NOT have to be spent within the year and never expires. It will stay in your account forever. This is SO important!!!
5. If you can put the max sum in the HSA every year, but not actually spend it immediately during the year for treatment (or decide to spend half the money and save half the money) and just let the account grow over the years, this is where the real magic is - because HSA dollars can eventually be invested the same way retirement funds are (i.e. 401k etc.)

HSAs are ""triple tax advantaged."" This means a) the money you contribute is pretax b) the money grows without being taxed c) if you use the money for healthcare expenses, it is tax free. I.e. you could essentially pay for Medicare with tax free dollars and any other medical expenses along the way during your retirement. This is better than ANY other retirement account out there. If you don't use the money in the HSA account for healthcare expenses, it is taxed the way a normal 401k/IRA is taxed for withdrawals. It's essentially a second retirement account that has major, major tax advantages.

**You reimburse yourself with HSA money for whatever your medical expenses are, but you don't have to do it during the same year as the expenses, unlike with an FSA.** This is MAGIC. This means that if you contribute $3400 of pretax dollars per year for the next 30-35 years and invest it well (i.e. an S&P 500 index fund that you never have to actively manage), you could end up with over $500,000 per person in this HSA account by the time you retire, assuming you get about 8% average returns - double that if you and your spouse both do it. If you save your receipts over the years - I read something by someone who said that whenever they get a medical bill now they just email themselves a digital copy of it and save it in a folder, but it's also incredibly easy to do with just a folder in a filing cabinet somewhere with any other important household paperwork that you have - you could let this money grow, and grow, and grow, and essentially reimburse yourself AFTER this tax free growth after 10 or 20 or 30 years (or any time along the way you want that money - it just needs to have some money left in the account growing) for whatever treatment you're getting today. The caveat here is that the HSA account must be established BEFORE the medical expense occurs. Yes, tax rules can change whenever, but this is a loophole that the people who write tax laws want to keep for themselves, so it's less likely that this sneaky little benefit will disappear.

Will I be doing this for next year? Absolutely. Even if the rules around reimbursement do change somewhere along the way, it's a fantastic financial planning tool for the future.",t2_3v03spe8,False,,0,False,Informational post on a huge tax loophole of HSA (vs FSA) accounts for paying for treatment,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_cvkd89,False,dark,0.93,,public,22,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,22,,False,self,1566834727.0,,[],{},,True,,1566830289.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I learned something VERY interesting about HSA (vs FSA) strategies today in terms of tax law/financial planning - searched the sub and found a few posts that ask questions about it but not something that addresses exactly what I&#39;m going to write - with 2020 open enrollment coming up in a few months, this might be a helpful long term strategy for someone out there.</p>

137,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Update (25/08/2019): so I've had 3 semen analyses done after this one (from my earlier post, where my sperm count was 8 million/ml and the quality was bad too), the first was 3 months after this one, which was also 3 months after I quit smoking, and the results showed a sperm count of around 45 million/ml the 2nd was about a 4 months ago and showed a count of 80 million/ml the other parameters were all good, but I was also found to have a varicocele, I didn't really trust the clinic I was going to (as the medical care in that country is known to be terrible)  and went to another clinic (in another country and after having known a few people that swear by that clinic) that I trust and had a semen analysis done there about 2 weeks ago and the result was 5 million/ml and 2ml total with normal forms 2% and I really trust this fertility clinic, they double checked the semen and confirmed the same results and while sperm is dynamic the differences between the different analyses is far too much, I do trust the most recent one far more than the previous ones, I had some sperm frozen just incase for any reason my sperm quality and quantity gets any worse at least I'll have something to try ICSI with at some point in the future, also had my varicocele embolization done the same week and so now I'm basically just crossing my fingers, trying to live a healthier lifestyle and hoping for the best in my next semen analysis set for January 2020

My wife and I have been trying to have a kid for the past 4 years and those wrong semen analyses have made it so much more frustrating but on the bright side at least we have a way forward now, she was also diagnosed with PCOS recently and we're working on that too.

I'm trying to be as supportive and hopeful as possible but I personally feel the chances of us having a child soon is so unlikely as we can't even afford the cost of ICSI yet, it costs around the equivalent of $6500 per attempt and I have no medical insurance and can't seem to find any affordable medical insurance that will cover infertility, my wife and I have always wanted to have kids early, whilst we are young and I've just been trying to process all of this internally whilst being completely optimistic and hopeful on the outside so as to not make it worse for her as she has really been struggling with coming to terms with the idea we may never be able to have children due to the risks associated with ICSI as well as the costs associated with it, thing is I'm a mess on the inside but I can't show it and its killing me on the inside and literally on my mind constantly.

 I went through a phase of severe depression years ago that lasted about 4 years and I struggled so much to get out of it and I'm so scared that I might go back into it again if I can't find a way to deal with this, I'm scared that if I go back into a depression I might not be able to get out of it for a much longer period this time, the same factors that caused the earlier depression are still there as well as this new factor.

<p>My wife and I have been trying to have a kid for the past 4 years and those wrong semen analyses have made it so much more frustrating but on the bright side at least we have a way forward now, she was also diagnosed with PCOS recently and we&#39;re working on that too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to be as supportive and hopeful as possible but I personally feel the chances of us having a child soon is so unlikely as we can&#39;t even afford the cost of ICSI yet, it costs around the equivalent of $6500 per attempt and I have no medical insurance and can&#39;t seem to find any affordable medical insurance that will cover infertility, my wife and I have always wanted to have kids early, whilst we are young and I&#39;ve just been trying to process all of this internally whilst being completely optimistic and hopeful on the outside so as to not make it worse for her as she has really been struggling with coming to terms with the idea we may never be able to have children due to the risks associated with ICSI as well as the costs associated with it, thing is I&#39;m a mess on the inside but I can&#39;t show it and its killing me on the inside and literally on my mind constantly.</p>

<p>I went through a phase of severe depression years ago that lasted about 4 years and I struggled so much to get out of it and I&#39;m so scared that I might go back into it again if I can&#39;t find a way to deal with this, I&#39;m scared that if I go back into a depression I might not be able to get out of it for a much longer period this time, the same factors that caused the earlier depression are still there as well as this new factor.</p>

I had a regular full flow “period” right at 4 weeks for one week and spotted very lightly on and off for another week. I had very minor cramping until two days after the methotrexate.

3. We have two second opinions scheduled just to ensure we’ve tried every protocol that might help us get more mature eggs.

168,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello!

It occurred to me that while I have been an occasional commenter and frequent lurker on this subreddit for a while now, I have yet to officially introduce myself. While my story can be pieced together by looking through my posts on other related subreddits, here is a summary of what's happened so far and my next steps:

In June 2018, my now-husband and I decided to try for a baby. I only have one ovary/tube due to a cyst/torsion at age 18, so I was fast-tracked on some of the more basic fertility testing after 6 months of trying. We did an hsg (all good), a semen analysis (all good), antral follicle count (okay but not great), and blood work (not good for my age, but not surprising due to having only one ovary). 

In January 2019, we did our first cycle with Femara. This resulted in a molar pregnancy, identified at my first ultrasound around 7 weeks. No genetic testing was done on the tissue as this was my first loss, but the ultrasound/pathology indicated a hydatidiform mole of some type. (In retrospect, I wish I had pushed for genetic testing, but more on that later.) My hcg levels were monitored for 3 months and I was cleared to try again.

I had another loss in July 2019. The ultrasound was abnormal, but did not quite have the classic molar pregnancy characteristics that my first one did. Pathology, however, was abnormal again and suggestive of molar pregnancy. This time, I had genetic testing done on the tissue. It was biparental diploid, indicating that there was a chromosomal contribution from both parents with no trisomy or other abnormal chromosomal problems. This is unusual for molar pregnancy, as the typical cases involve an egg lacking DNA and one-two sperm (complete mole) or one normal egg and two sperm (partial mole).

Having two consecutive molar pregnancies coupled with the fact that my second was a more unusual type (chromosomal contributions from both parents), I am now on the path of genetic testing for mutations in either my NLRP7 or KHDC3L genes (see here for a brief summary: [https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/recurrent-hydatidiform-mole#genes](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/recurrent-hydatidiform-mole#genes)). If a mutation is found, this means that the chance of a normal pregnancy with my own eggs is more or less 0%. 

I am currently working with a genetic counselor at my fertility clinic to get genetic testing done to see if I have any genetic mutations. Even if I don't, though, the prognosis doesn't look great. According to this article ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920063/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920063/)), the recommendation may end up being donor eggs regardless of whether a mutation is found. The counselor is also going back and trying to see if any conclusive results can be found from the slides from my first loss. The goal is to determine whether that one was also biparental diploid (if only I had known that my first loss would end up needing genetic testing...).

Regardless of whether I have any mutations and what the genetic testing on my first loss reveals, I am now at anywhere from a 15% to 25% chance of having a third consecutive molar pregnancy. Given the associated risks of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease and possibly choriocarcinoma, I don't know that it makes any sense to try for pregnancy again with my own eggs. 

I've spent a lot of time thinking about a child with my husband's genes and not mine. I've come to accept this as an okay possibility. It doesn't make sense to jeopardize my health and waste more time on hcg monitoring for a third molar pregnancy.

Now I'm just waiting. Waiting to get the genetic testing results on my first loss (at least 4-6 weeks). Waiting to get my own genetic results (up to 3 months). Waiting to finish my post-molar monitoring period (minimum 3 months, maybe 6 months this time). Waiting to see whether my sister has this genetic mutation, and if not, whether she would be willing to be an egg donor. If not, waiting to locate and proceed with an unrelated donor. Waiting for an egg donor to go through egg retrieval. Waiting to see whether we end up with any viable embryos. Waiting to see if any result in a normal pregnancy. There's just a lot of waiting ahead of me at this point. I'm in limbo and I don't see that changing for quite a while. It kills me to thinking about how many months/years of waiting could be ahead of me.

tl;dr I've had two consecutive molar pregnancies. I'm waiting on genetic testing. I might not be able to use my own eggs. I have a long wait ahead of me - genetic testing, egg donation, etc.

<p>It occurred to me that while I have been an occasional commenter and frequent lurker on this subreddit for a while now, I have yet to officially introduce myself. While my story can be pieced together by looking through my posts on other related subreddits, here is a summary of what&#39;s happened so far and my next steps:</p>

<p>In June 2018, my now-husband and I decided to try for a baby. I only have one ovary/tube due to a cyst/torsion at age 18, so I was fast-tracked on some of the more basic fertility testing after 6 months of trying. We did an hsg (all good), a semen analysis (all good), antral follicle count (okay but not great), and blood work (not good for my age, but not surprising due to having only one ovary). </p>

<p>In January 2019, we did our first cycle with Femara. This resulted in a molar pregnancy, identified at my first ultrasound around 7 weeks. No genetic testing was done on the tissue as this was my first loss, but the ultrasound/pathology indicated a hydatidiform mole of some type. (In retrospect, I wish I had pushed for genetic testing, but more on that later.) My hcg levels were monitored for 3 months and I was cleared to try again.</p>

<p>I had another loss in July 2019. The ultrasound was abnormal, but did not quite have the classic molar pregnancy characteristics that my first one did. Pathology, however, was abnormal again and suggestive of molar pregnancy. This time, I had genetic testing done on the tissue. It was biparental diploid, indicating that there was a chromosomal contribution from both parents with no trisomy or other abnormal chromosomal problems. This is unusual for molar pregnancy, as the typical cases involve an egg lacking DNA and one-two sperm (complete mole) or one normal egg and two sperm (partial mole).</p>

<p>Having two consecutive molar pregnancies coupled with the fact that my second was a more unusual type (chromosomal contributions from both parents), I am now on the path of genetic testing for mutations in either my NLRP7 or KHDC3L genes (see here for a brief summary: <a href=""https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/recurrent-hydatidiform-mole#genes"">https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/recurrent-hydatidiform-mole#genes</a>). If a mutation is found, this means that the chance of a normal pregnancy with my own eggs is more or less 0%. </p>

<p>I am currently working with a genetic counselor at my fertility clinic to get genetic testing done to see if I have any genetic mutations. Even if I don&#39;t, though, the prognosis doesn&#39;t look great. According to this article (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920063/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920063/</a>), the recommendation may end up being donor eggs regardless of whether a mutation is found. The counselor is also going back and trying to see if any conclusive results can be found from the slides from my first loss. The goal is to determine whether that one was also biparental diploid (if only I had known that my first loss would end up needing genetic testing...).</p>

<p>Regardless of whether I have any mutations and what the genetic testing on my first loss reveals, I am now at anywhere from a 15% to 25% chance of having a third consecutive molar pregnancy. Given the associated risks of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease and possibly choriocarcinoma, I don&#39;t know that it makes any sense to try for pregnancy again with my own eggs. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a lot of time thinking about a child with my husband&#39;s genes and not mine. I&#39;ve come to accept this as an okay possibility. It doesn&#39;t make sense to jeopardize my health and waste more time on hcg monitoring for a third molar pregnancy.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m just waiting. Waiting to get the genetic testing results on my first loss (at least 4-6 weeks). Waiting to get my own genetic results (up to 3 months). Waiting to finish my post-molar monitoring period (minimum 3 months, maybe 6 months this time). Waiting to see whether my sister has this genetic mutation, and if not, whether she would be willing to be an egg donor. If not, waiting to locate and proceed with an unrelated donor. Waiting for an egg donor to go through egg retrieval. Waiting to see whether we end up with any viable embryos. Waiting to see if any result in a normal pregnancy. There&#39;s just a lot of waiting ahead of me at this point. I&#39;m in limbo and I don&#39;t see that changing for quite a while. It kills me to thinking about how many months/years of waiting could be ahead of me.</p>

<p>tl;dr I&#39;ve had two consecutive molar pregnancies. I&#39;m waiting on genetic testing. I might not be able to use my own eggs. I have a long wait ahead of me - genetic testing, egg donation, etc.</p>

<p>If anyone else has experienced recurrent molar pregnancies, I would love to hear from you!</p>

186,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'm 30 and single, and based in Australia. In May last year I had my AMH, FSH etc. tested because my younger sister had recently been diagnosed with hypoestrogenism and was in the process of being investigated for primary ovarian insufficiency. She was eventually diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, likely a result of an eating disorder during her teens. I decided to have myself tested in case she needed donor eggs at some point in the future. Unfortunately, my AMH came back at 5 pmol/L (0.7 ng/L). My other bloods were within the normal range. My first AFC showed a total of 5 follicles, 3 on one ovary and 2 on the other. A repeat AFC about 6 months later showed 6 follicles on my right ovary, and 2 on the left. One of the follicles on the left ovary matured and ovulation was confirmed by ultrasound. I was referred to a Fertility Specialist (not a Reproductive Endocrinologist; in Australia fertility specialists are usually Obstetrician/Gynaecologists with additional training and sub-specialisation in Fertility Medicine) who told me that, while my tests show that I am fertile now, there is no way to predict how long I will remain fertile and that, given the low AMH, I should do something to preserve my fertility sooner rather than later. 

I considered freezing eggs, but all the studies I've read suggest that women with low AMH don't respond as well to ovarian stimulation as those with a normal AMH, and I might have to undergo multiple rounds to get enough eggs. As each cycle costs approximately $10,000 and there is no guarantee that I would be able to have a baby in the future even if I had the recommended minimum 15-20 eggs on ice, I decided to go the single mother route and use donor sperm. For a number of personal reasons, I preferred a known donor to an anonymous donor. A friend introduced me to a male friend of hers who had previously expressed interest in donating sperm, and I spent months getting to know him in order to decide whether I wanted him to be the biological father of my hypothetical child. I eventually flew interstate to meet him in person, and we both decided that he would be my sperm donor. Less than a month after meeting in person, he had a mental breakdown (his words) and sent me a text to say that he couldn't proceed and that I should find someone else. I was pretty devastated, and at a loss as to what I should do. 

The fertility clinic's counsellor encouraged me to consider an anonymous sperm donor, and I signed the paperwork with the intention of going down that route as I felt that I didn't have any other option. It's illegal to pay for gamete donation in Australia and my clinic, which is the one of the larger fertility clinics in the country, has less than 50 donors on their books and only a small number of donors with counts suitable for IUI. Shortly after I signed the paperwork, two male friends volunteered to donate sperm. Both of them are good guys, intelligent, attractive etc. Ultimately, I choose the guy who doesn't have a family history of depression or other mental illness, because I have a family history of mental illness and I wanted to reduce the overall genetic risk of mental illness for my potential child. For context, I'm a medical doctor with a background in genetics research, so thinking about genetic risk of any heritable illness has been a part of my process in selecting a donor. I gave my chosen donor the go ahead and provided all the relevant contact information for him to get started with his part of the donation process (medical tests, donation and counselling) nearly three months ago, and he hasn't made an appointment with the clinic yet, despite knowing that it's incredibly important to me, not to mention time-sensitive. I've gently reminded him multiple times now, trying not to nag, and his excuse is that he has been too busy with work. Every time it comes up, he promises to do something about it in the next week, but so far he hasn't. When I've asked whether he has changed his mind, he gets offended that tells me that he's promised to do it, so he'll do it. My clinic requires a 3-month quarantine period from the time of donation to fertilisation, to ensure that the donor doesn't have any blood-borne viruses, so even if he gets into the clinic next week the earliest I'll be able to start is late November/early December.

I have put my career and personal life on hold so that I can pursue this path. I've been working myself to the bone to save enough money for fertility treatments and, if it works, the actual raising of a child. I'm stressed and exhausted, and getting to the end of my tether with this donor. To add to that, my last period was two weeks late (I've been fairly regular since stopping birth control, and I'm not pregnant), and my Fertility Specialist wants me to go through all the usual tests again to see if anything has changed. I've explained this to my chosen donor, and again got a promise that he would make an appointment (he hasn't). I don't know what to do. I chose him for several reasons, but I'm terrified that I'm going to miss my window (if I haven't already). I know there are a lot of reasons for a late period that don't include perimenopause, but of course it's impossible not to worry about that. I've always wanted to have a child, and I'm fortunate in that I can afford to be a single mother and have the support of my family. I just need the sperm. Do I go with the other friend, who I ruled out due to my concerns about mental illness, or do I wait on the other guy? Either way, it's going to be three months before I can start trying. If I abandon the idea of a known donor, and go with an anonymous donor, I can start almost right away. I have never been quite comfortable with the idea of an anonymous donor, for a few reasons, but I'm starting to think that it might be the best option. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I know that I can't wait forever.

<p>The other two options that are currently offered to us are adoption and donor sperm. We’ll probably look into the first option in 6-7 years if we really are keen in starting a family. But it just sucks that these are our only two options. </p>

<p>Thank you for listening 💕</p>

*TL;dr Just started 3rd try at IVF after two poor responses to short protocols (which were converted to failed IUIs).  Dr put me on long protocol now wants to switch back due to migraines. What to do now?* 

Long version. 

April/May 2019 - Clinic #1: Short cycle, follicles failed to grow, converted to IUI.  Failed.  Unhappy with Drs professionalism (messed up prescriptions) so we decided to switch. 

June - Clinic #2: Agreed long protocol might make more sense, delayed due to drug issues in Canada.  Agreed to try another short protocol in the meantime.  Same results, poor response, converted to IUI, failed.  

July - Clinic #2: Consult for long protocol, meds and calendar given, payment taken.  At that time I raised with the nurse concerns of birth control pill.  This was the first I was aware that it was part of the protocol, Dr never mentioned it.  Nurse says Dr wouldn't have prescribed it if it wasn't safe.  I said again, ""I am an aura migraine sufferer"".  Advise was to start the protocol and call with any issues.

Fast forward to Day 5 of BCP - 3 migraines in 3 days.... Called the clinic and the nurse told me to stop the BCP and come in for an ultrasound when I start bleeding.  I asked why, and she said that the Dr told her to switch me back to a short protocol. - Now, at this point, **in the middle of a migraine,** I start crying and ask why he would switch me back to a protocol we know doesn't work. She seemed shocked, and admitted the Dr hadn't looked at my file!!!  This is just ""what they do when people can't have BCP.""   


I got so upset that my husband took over the call - we have an appointment to see the Dr on Monday, after much pressing.  I'm furious. I'm shocked.  How could he prescribe this protocol in the first place, without discussing the migraines?  How could he just switch it without reviewing our file?  

We made the decision in April to start IVF, and here we are staring at September and no further forward.  I don't even know what to do next!  He is supposed to be the best in our city.  

How do we approach this meeting?  How can I trust this Clinic, supposedly the best? How do we move forward, I am so heartbroken.  How can we have a baby when we can't make it past the starting line? :/

After three failed IUIs with CCRM Colorado, it's time to move on to IVF. We are seriously leaning towards doing IVF in Prague to save money. We have no insurance coverage and just doing the IUIs has been a real financial burden. We will most likely be paying for IVF with some combination of credit cards (interest free introductory offers) and personal loans. I have done the free 20 minute conversation with Sue from IVF traveler, but I don't want to pay for consulting until we're for sure going to Prague.

According to CCRM, to proceed with IVF we will need the following. This is in addition to the work up that I did before my IUI in January.

Hysteroscopy $740

Doppler Ultrasound $275

Sperm Chromatin $474

Communicable Diseases $840

Total $2329

Should I get this all done at CCRM? Should I shop around? After paying for all this, will I still save money going to Prague? How and where did you all get this done before doing IVF abroad? I actually really like my RE at CCRM and I don't want to go through the whole process of shopping around again in CO and then again in Prague. I also feel a little weird about doing this whole work up and IVF training with CCRM then ditching them for Prague.

To complicate things, I start grad school in two weeks and won't be able to miss much class or my internship to go to appointments or travel so I was hoping to do my workup next week and IVF over my winter break.

Edit: The reason I want to do a hysteroscopy is that my HSG in January showed a filling defect in my lower uterine segment. At the time, we chose not to pursue further testing but now we would like to.

My insurance has a pretty strict absolutely no infertility related coverage rule - including diagnostics.

At this time, we have focused on lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, reducing stress, getting sleep, etc) and basic supplements recommended by our RE.

Typically I love this and see it as a blessing, because I love food, but my RE said it looks like any supplemental estrogen is just metabolized too fast and my body doesn’t have time to register it, which is why estradiol doesn’t work, but stimulating my own ovaries to produce estrogen has worked.

I had a suppository pain killer, as well as a diazepam. I’m pretty sure the diazepam didn’t do anything for me as diazepam’s never do. 

In the operation theatre, I actually started crying hysterically and made a huge fool out of myself. The RE and nurse kept reassuring me I’d be fine and trying to relax me. My husband too. 

They used the speculum to ‘open’ my vagina and a local numbing agent was injected near my cervix. Similar to what they use at the dentists. I didn’t really feel this - shockingly. I just felt a mild jabbing and I honestly could not tell it was the numbing injection going in. My nurse had to tell me it had been done!! 

I then had gas and air and said a bunch of stupid stuff. I kept telling my husband I loved him whilst stroking his hair, all whilst my nurse was constantly moving my arm away from his head because I was knocking the blood pressure cuff off of my arm. I also kept swearing and saying I had no idea where I was. Truthfully I was in another world. It was crazy good! I also kept talking about my dog for some reason and everyone was laughing. 

I did feel some pressure like pain that made me wince a few times, but I would describe it as more of a deep aching sensation than anything stabby or overly painful. At one point, my husband told me I gasped out in pain and said “that really hurts, please give me some more gas and air” and they complied and I was fine. 

It was all over in 15 minutes, I got 19 eggs. 

I hope this reassures anyone in future about their egg collection if it isn’t under proper sedation or GA! I was terrified and had been crying all morning about it. I barely slept a wink last night. It was totally fine and I’m at home resting up now :-)

Looking for some other thoughts/opinions.

My husband and I have been trying on our own for 15 months now to conceive, and last month we had our first appointment with a fertility specialist (we are in Perth, Australia).

After a cycle of tracking with bloods, and ultrasounds, which confirmed ovulation and hormone levels are good.

Ultrasound in the next cycle revealed I had a low antral follicle count in one ovary (it was 3 or 4 from memory), and then HyCoSy confirmed my tubes are clear.

Visiting the Dr. today to get all our results, and see how to proceed…

My AMH is considered very low (that of a 38 year old, I am 28!) at 6.5pmol/L and that together with my low follicle count, and slightly high FSH at the start of my cycle that was tracked, it looks like I have low ovarian reserve.

The Dr has said, that if we keep trying on our own, through a medicated/timed cycle, or IUI our conception rate would likely only be 10%...

IVF would be 45%.

What would you guys do?

I can’t figure out what to do… What I want to do… I feel a bit stunned.

(I read through the rules, but I apologize if I missed any. This is my first time posting)

I started trying when I was 39. I’m now 43. 
We tried 4 stim cycles with zero viable embryos and decided to cut our losses and go with donor eggs.

I messaged the mods before creating this standalone.  This is something I think a lot of people may struggle and hopefully this post can help more people than me : )

This is kinda long but should be an easy read.  Im kinda jelling today which is odd because Ive felt like a blithering airhead idiot for several months now.  Usually I can't think straight or devote more than 10 minutes of concentration to anything.  This hasn't helped me in my RE interview search.  Anyhow- heres my backstory.

I did my first round locally at the one clinic in my state that reports data to the CDC.  It failed miserably.  So, I scrambled to find another clinic- in driving distance - with better success rates - - -on the mother fucking phone.  We were in a race against time because I was going to lose out of insurance coverage by the end of the year.

Doctors doctors doctors out the yin yang.  I narrowed it down.  Spoke to one RE on the phone.

**We were completely unprepared.  I had zero idea what to ask for....sadly I still don't.  We paid $150 for an hour but only talked for 30 minutes.**

Meanwhile, another clinic we were looking at called me and said they were now offering FREE SECOND OPINION SKYPES. I don't know if this should've been a warning sign or not.  Anyhow, I had my Skype call.  They dude seemed ok, seemed a hell of a lot better than where I was. He had good reviews, was in driving distance (5 hours), accepted my insurance and had good success rates for my age.

He and I do not mess well at all.  But this post is not about my hatred for him.

Ive had 2 failed FETs with PGS normals and just transferred my last normal on Friday.

I haven't been expecting this FET to work, so I have been trying to research where I will go do my third round....hopefully immediately after I get this failed Beta on Monday.

Holy hell has this been a nightmare.

I have already spoken with 2 REs at 2 of the most reputable fertility clinics in the USA.  But guess what...I bombed them too.  I was unprepared, timid, afraid to ask question- I didn't know how to *interpret their answers...spot the bullshit and really hold them to what they were telling me*. **<<<<======= is what I want to do now!!!!**

The last phone call I had...I just sat there dumbfounded while he spoke.  He told me he'd send me a transcript of our phone call, so no need to write notes.  I liked what I was hearing...alot but then suddenly it was time for him to get off of the phone.  Apparently there was a 45 minute cap.  The notes the nurse sent me was not a recap.  I still have many questions, and will likely email the clinic again....but I got sidetracked because it was time to begin MY FET protocol and try to deal with my current RE (who I switched to a couple of months ago.  she's in the same clinic, just not an asshole).

So, now, I have spoken to two different REs for $500.  I feel like there should be protocol for how we are supposed to navigate and conduct these types of consults.

I feel like I owe it to myself to continue looking at doctors and not just going with the first one I like.   I just got off the phone with another clinic....in another state.  He does free in person consults but Skype consults cost $200.  FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'll pay it but dammit I want to be prepared this time, know what to expect, how to respond and what is acceptable.

<p>Edit: we decided to postpone IUI until next month. Thank you all for the suggestions, for teaching me, and for all the added input. Xoxo</p>

The most recent pregnancy was in April 2019, which was a chemical pregnancy. That was my second medicated cycle on Clomid and TI.

After the CP, we changed to Letrozole + IUI , just to try something different. I was very confident that the IUI would work.

IUI #1 - Failed.

IUI #2 - Upped doze of Letrozole, still failed.

I am 12 dpo and tested negative today. So, I'm pretty sure it's over with this cycle too.

255,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi r/infertility community.  I believe I finally figured out how to use the flair and I recently got bad news, so I would like to tap the resource of this very knowledgeable sub.  I hope this qualifies for a stand alone post.  I'm 42F, spouse is 43M.

**My main question** \- Dr. Norbert Gleicher at the Center for Human Reproduction in NYC (not local for me), does anyone have knowledge of this doctor and his claims to have a 30% success rate for getting women over 40 pregnant with their own eggs?

**For treatment history and further questions and feelings, please keep reading.**

I started going to a hospital affiliated fertility clinic (known to be conservative in treatment protocols, but the only locally based clinic in my city) in 4/2018, right before my 41st birthday.  Did all the testing, doctors were optimistic about my chances of getting pregnant.  They said my ovaries were younger than I was (AMH 3.943).  I started taking 25 mg DHEA and 200 mg COQ10, both 3 times a day.  Spouse's SA was normal for number and mobility.  Would further SA be helpful?

I did 2 IUIs in the summer of 2018, the second one resulted in a chemical pregnancy - no heatbeat detected.  Both IUIs were done with antagonist protocol medications.

This wasn't going to be easy.  I limited alcohol to 1, 4 oz. drink a week and caffeine to one cup a day.  I work out twice a week.  I reduced my anxiety medication (prozac) as low as possible without negative consequences (4 mls of a 20 mg per 5ml liquid).

Next, IVF with BC priming - first 2 were antagonist protocol (Gonal F, Centrotide, Menopur, HGH) where I had follicles numbering in the teens for each round, but resulted in only 1 embryo.  First IVF was triggered by hCG and the second with hCG and Lupron). Doctor said I might have empty follicle syndrome and that I should move to a donor egg.

I wasn't ready to move to a donor, so she suggested a micro dose Lupron protocol (micro dose Lupron, Gonal F, Menopur, HGH) that I would try for 3 additional rounds of IVF from 12/2018 to 8/2019.  Third IVF trigger was hCG, fourth was hCG (needed a booster) and Lupron (screw up with the weekend doctor, my doctor told me at my follow-up appointment that if anyone tried to trigger me with Lupron again to tell them ""hell no""), and the fifth trigger was hCG (needed a booster).  The results were much better, over these 3 rounds, I got 10 additional embryos, each time the number of mature follicles numbered in the teens and most fertilized, but as you know, the hunger games happened.  During the fifth round my estradiol level went over 4,300 and I was at risk for OHSS.  I was put on cabergoline right before retrieval.  If you ever need this medication, do yourself a favor and take stool softeners with it.  I have never been that constipated.

After sending the 11 embryos to CopperGenomics, 8 were complex abnormal, 2 were abnormal, and 1 is no result and needs to be re-biopsied, but I'm not hopeful.

Different clinic doctor (mine is on leave) told me by phone a week ago about the genetic results of the fifth round and said that the probability of having a baby with my own egg is <5%.  She suggested going back to IUI or moving to donor eggs.  We have an appointment with her on Thursday of this coming week.  Is she suggesting IUI because of the suspect ability of genetic testing?  I have read research papers about mosaics and even abnormals that have produced genetically normal babies (mostly outside the US).  Maybe I am being overly optimistic about this possibility, but my clinic has said they will not transfer our abnormal embryos and I wonder if the IUI is a way for the doctor to get around the policy.  The downside is that we may have another CP or a genetically abnormal fetus that we have to make hard decisions about.

I have been told I would be a good candidate for a donor egg (although I don't count on anything be ""easy"" anymore).  I'm having a very hard time giving up my dream of seeing what a child that is a mixture of my spouse and I would be like in personality and physical appearance.  My biggest fear is that it will feel like I am raising someone else's child.  My next project is reading books on donor eggs and epigenetics, but I haven't found much up-to-date literature out there.  Has anyone read something they would recommend?

I think I would like to try another IUI with the micro dose Lupron protocol.  Someone told me that the micro dose Lupron protocol tends to produce a higher number of lower quality follicles, is that true?  My spouse is mostly understanding, but really just wants a child.  Of course, unlike me, he passes on his genetics either way.

If I am leaving out any details that would clarify anything, please let me know.  Thank you for reading this wall of text and any thoughts would be appreciated.

TL;DR - Not sure if it's worth continuing with IVF after 3 FET implantation failures with zero likely root causes.  **Looking for personal stories from folks who have never had successful implantation**.

Here's why that last sentence is in bold.  From a year+ of browsing relevant forums online, an IRL support group and a number of friends who have gone through IVF, I have not yet met success cases with my situation.  It feels shitty, but more importantly, it's difficult for me to judge how much someone else's experience or advice can apply to me.  

I've had really well-intentioned folks IRL give a lot of really heartfelt advice on the tests to do, doctors to see, and ""pray/relax/stay positive and it will happen"".  Then I find out that they're having fertility issues after natural/assisted pregnancies or miscarriages, and that they have never met someone in my situation before.  It's not the same, and it's not helpful.  When I did online research into those ""miracle"" tests and treatments, all the successes are women who have had successful implantation before.

Medical history:

1. Never had regular menstruation.  Periods basically stopped in early 20s.  Diagnosed with PCOS at 24.  Always bled regularly on OCP.
2. No insulin, pituitary, or autoimmune issues (all tested).  Healthy.  Normal BMI.
3. No factors on my husband's side.
4. 33 yo.  AMH >25.  Very high antral follicle count.
5. No endometriosis.  Estrogen and progesterone normal for every FET cycle.  Normal ERA.  Normal SHG.
6. Retrieved 36 eggs.  97% fertilization rate.  60% high quality.
7. FET#1: 1 transferred -> FET#2: 2 transferred -> ERA -> PGS: 44% genetically normal -> FET#3: 1 transferred
8. *Never had a positive pregnancy test.*

After all these failures, I'm just wondering what the point is in continuing.  It has been psychologically trying, especially since #2 to #6 mean that I should have had a much higher chance of success, but we don't even have a hint that this is going to work out.

If we transfer 2 at a time, my insurance will cover the transfers for my remaining embryos.  But I just want to give up now.  We can adopt.  (Surrogacy is off the table for me.)  Or we can just have a full and meaningful life without children.  My husband prefers that we keep trying until we use up the embryos.  I can do probably do that without too much resentment, but mentally, I'm just done.

**If there's anyone out there who have been in my situation (unexplained recurrent implantation failure without any prior successes), I'd love to hear your story, especially:**

1. **Did you keep trying or did you stop?**
2. **How did you arrive at that decision?**
3. **How do you feel about it now?**

<p>Please help:)!</p>

My wife and I have been trying to start a family for years. Unfortunately due to issues on both sides, we've learned that our only real chances of success are through IVF.  

While we both struggle with stress and anxiety, my wife is extremely stressed and anxious about the situation, to the point where she cant sleep and has gotten sick.  Shes mostly stressed about the cost of the process, which we have to pay for up front, in cash and our insurance covers exactly nothing related to infertility.   

I'm looking for new jobs with higher pay and better benefits, asking for a raise with my current job, exploring refinancing our house, and we have even established a GoFundMe to ask for support of our family & friends (which was extremely hard to do - we're both proud and stubborn people, and prefer to help others rather than asking for help ourselves) 

Unfortunately initial tests indicate that her egg production is lower than it should be and we've been advised that we need to move quickly.  So along with the cost, she feels an immense amount of pressure and like our success is up to her. To make matters worse, shes trying to get off of her anxiety medication in preparation for the process.

I do my best to reassure her and keep her as calm as I can, but nothing I do seems to help.  I know that stress and anxiety can negatively impact our chances of success,  but more importantly,  I hate to see her this way.  

Any advice for how she or I can help to manage stress & anxiety would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for reading our story.

I decided to take the reproductive immunological stance *before* starting IVF for a number of reasons, the primary reason being that I have celiac disease which is an autoimmune disorder. In addition to that I have a MTHFR genetic mutation. Many people only see an RI after failed cycles, but since there was one close by who was just starting his practice that came recommended by someone who goes to the same RE as I am and I decided to book in and see what he could figure out and see if we could get some sort of running start with this.

**The initial visit:** The first visit with my RI was about a half hour long. We talked through my fertility history, start to finish, as well as my health history, he asked clarifying questions about the clinic I was going to, and explained his process. He did say in our initial visit that he usually asks his patients to slow down a bit, which is hard for many of them. I was (at the time) on the wait list for the clinic I'm at now and still planning on IUIs so I was like ""hey! no problem!' In addition to that, he basically explained that the RE runs the IVF cycle however they want, and he makes medical suggestions based on test results that compliment the RE's schedule.

At the initial visit he ran these tests:

* Testosterone, Free, Total, and Sex Hormone Binding globulin
* Antiphospholipid Antibody Panel
* Phosphatidylserine AB
* Cardiolipin AB
* Comprehensive Metabolic Panel
* TSI
* Phosphatidylserine AB
* DHEA, Unconjugated
* Phosphatidylinositol AB
* Phosphatidylethanolamine AB
* Phosphatidylglycerol AB
* AMH
* Phosphatidic Acid AB
* ABO Group and RH Type
* Homocysteine
* Hemoglobin A1C
* 25-OH Vit D
* Immunoglobulin G, M, A
* TSH w/ Reflex to FT4
* Thyroid Peroxidase and Thyroglobulin Antibodies
* Partial Thromboplastin Time, Activated
* CBC (includes Diff/PLT)
* Iron and Total Iron Binding Capacity
* Ferritin
* Transferrin
* ANA Screen
* DNA Antibody
* SM and SM/RNP Antibodies
* Histone Antibodies
* DHEA Sulfate
* Insulin
* Prolactin
* ANCA Screen with Reflex to Titer
* SCL-70 Antibody
* NK Activity Assay
* TH1:TH2 Cytokine Ratio Plus

**Second visit:** By the second visit we had switched REs and were working with our second clinic and working towards IVF. This sped up our RI timeline quite a bit and I had a grasp on what my IVF protocol was going to be like which helped my RI be more specific with suggestions. We also had our test results back and we had a meeting that was roughly 90 minutes long. I had gotten my test results in advance, done a bunch of googling, and had a lot of questions for him. He went through every single test result with me, and  he found some things in the test that warranted some IVF protocol additions and he also recommended some supplement/diet/lifestyle changes as well that he knew would be complimentary based on the results.

In addition to this, he wanted to run some additional tests. These tests are responses to things found in the initial bloodwork and are more personalized than the first list which he has given everyone I know who has seen him. These are the ones I had done in the second round:

* Factor XIII V34L Mutation Analysis
* Beta Fibrinogen 455G>A Mutation
* Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 4G/5G
* Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Level
* Human Platelet Antigen 1 Genotype
* Prothrombin (Factor II) 20210G -> A Mutation Analysis
* Factor V (Leiden) Mutation Analysis
* Protein C and S Activity with Reflex to Protein C and/or S Antigen
* We also reran a few to see if the supplement/diet/lifestyle changes had helped improve some numbers

At this point, I have not yet seen him a third time but we do communicate via our portal. Basically, as my RE makes a change, I pass that change along to him. If the RI makes a suggestion, I pass that suggestion along to my RE. They get along pretty well and seem to have relatively aligned strategies, though my RI is more nuanced in his approach, and things more holistically (and not in the woo woo sense, but more in the ""lets investigate your supplement brands and lets think about endocrine disrupters"" sense.)

**What now:** My RI has not yet set up a specific protocol for me and is waiting on the results of the additional testing, though my RE took the results of the initial tests that my RI did and put me on a ""half step"" immune system protocol. I'm doing a little immunological prime directed and thought up by my RE and cleared by the RI. Once the RI has his plan together I'll pass it to the RE and we'll go from there. We're just waiting on those final test results.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Obviously, I have had no success or failure yet since I have yet to go through IVF. Also, my first IVF will be with all of this added on, so I won't have a ""baseline"" IVF cycle without these interventions. I just wanted to speak to the experience of working with an RI so people could understand what happens when you go see one. I didn't put too much specific medical information in because each of us have such different cases that what I'm doing and the protocol changes I have might differ from what you'd do based on your results. I'm happy to speak about them if asked, but I just wanted people to understand how working with an RI can potentially go.

**Update 11/15/2019:**  After we received the last set of test results back, we learned that I had another thrombophelia (PAI-1 4G/4G) issue on top of the MTFHR. My RI drew up an extensive treatment plan that was divided into three parts: Prior to conception (stim cycle), conception cycle (transfer cycle), and pregnancy monitoring. It was a very, very detailed plan and I think I started hyperventilating the first time I read it through since it seemed so overwhelming.

Here are the issues we are addressing through this plan and what we are doing about them (some treatments overlap):

* MTFHR and  homocystinuria: Daily methylfolate/B complex vitamin (I take this one: [One Elevated Methyl Folate +](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQJVHHC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)), baby aspirin, lovenox
* Iron Deficiency: Switched from regular iron supplements to lactoferrin. (I take this one: [Jarrow Lactoferrin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OQGBY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ) and take it with vitamin C to increase absorption
* PAI-1 4G/4G: Lovenox, Metformin, Baby Aspirin
* Celiac Disease: Strict gluten free diet
* Elevated NK cells: Prednisone, Intralipids 1x a week

We spent another month ""prepping"" for our IVF stim cycle by starting all the medications and interventions listed above and then rechecking my levels to make sure everything was where it needed to be prior to my stim cycle. Once we were satisfied with that, we started stims and had our retrieval. Even though I was hoping for a frozen transfer, my RI wisely insisted I prep for a fresh transfer just in case starting the day after retrieval. This is what ended up happening, so in hindsight I'm glad he pushed on this. This was mostly just starting lovenox and intralipids. 

**Mod approved update, potential trigger:** After all this prep work and investigation, we did have success with our fresh transfer. My RI is continuing to supervise my care and I will be putting up a thread in r/InfertilityBabies that details pregnancy care with an RI as my RI will begin to partner with my OB/GYN after I graduate from my RE.",,False,,0,False,"Adventures in Reproductive Immunology, including a full test list.",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_crfg6w,False,dark,1.0,,public,31,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,31,,,self,1573841670.0,,,{},,True,,1566033059.0,text,0,,,,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve PM&#39;d this info to several people over the last few days so I figured I&#39;d make a stand alone post and maybe add some additional details just in case someone wants to know or someone (in the future) decides to search Reproductive Immunology.</p>

<p><strong>Second visit:</strong> By the second visit we had switched REs and were working with our second clinic and working towards IVF. This sped up our RI timeline quite a bit and I had a grasp on what my IVF protocol was going to be like which helped my RI be more specific with suggestions. We also had our test results back and we had a meeting that was roughly 90 minutes long. I had gotten my test results in advance, done a bunch of googling, and had a lot of questions for him. He went through every single test result with me, and  he found some things in the test that warranted some IVF protocol additions and he also recommended some supplement/diet/lifestyle changes as well that he knew would be complimentary based on the results.</p>

<p>In addition to this, he wanted to run some additional tests. These tests are responses to things found in the initial bloodwork and are more personalized than the first list which he has given everyone I know who has seen him. These are the ones I had done in the second round:</p>

<ul>
<li>Factor XIII V34L Mutation Analysis</li>
<li>Beta Fibrinogen 455G&gt;A Mutation</li>
<li>Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 4G/5G</li>
<li>Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Level</li>
<li>Human Platelet Antigen 1 Genotype</li>
<li>Prothrombin (Factor II) 20210G -&gt; A Mutation Analysis</li>
<li>Factor V (Leiden) Mutation Analysis</li>
<li>Protein C and S Activity with Reflex to Protein C and/or S Antigen</li>
<li>We also reran a few to see if the supplement/diet/lifestyle changes had helped improve some numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, I have not yet seen him a third time but we do communicate via our portal. Basically, as my RE makes a change, I pass that change along to him. If the RI makes a suggestion, I pass that suggestion along to my RE. They get along pretty well and seem to have relatively aligned strategies, though my RI is more nuanced in his approach, and things more holistically (and not in the woo woo sense, but more in the &quot;lets investigate your supplement brands and lets think about endocrine disrupters&quot; sense.)</p>

<p><strong>What now:</strong> My RI has not yet set up a specific protocol for me and is waiting on the results of the additional testing, though my RE took the results of the initial tests that my RI did and put me on a &quot;half step&quot; immune system protocol. I&#39;m doing a little immunological prime directed and thought up by my RE and cleared by the RI. Once the RI has his plan together I&#39;ll pass it to the RE and we&#39;ll go from there. We&#39;re just waiting on those final test results.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions. Obviously, I have had no success or failure yet since I have yet to go through IVF. Also, my first IVF will be with all of this added on, so I won&#39;t have a &quot;baseline&quot; IVF cycle without these interventions. I just wanted to speak to the experience of working with an RI so people could understand what happens when you go see one. I didn&#39;t put too much specific medical information in because each of us have such different cases that what I&#39;m doing and the protocol changes I have might differ from what you&#39;d do based on your results. I&#39;m happy to speak about them if asked, but I just wanted people to understand how working with an RI can potentially go.</p>

<p><strong>Update 11/15/2019:</strong>  After we received the last set of test results back, we learned that I had another thrombophelia (PAI-1 4G/4G) issue on top of the MTFHR. My RI drew up an extensive treatment plan that was divided into three parts: Prior to conception (stim cycle), conception cycle (transfer cycle), and pregnancy monitoring. It was a very, very detailed plan and I think I started hyperventilating the first time I read it through since it seemed so overwhelming.</p>

<p>Here are the issues we are addressing through this plan and what we are doing about them (some treatments overlap):</p>

<ul>
<li>MTFHR and  homocystinuria: Daily methylfolate/B complex vitamin (I take this one: <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQJVHHC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"">One Elevated Methyl Folate +</a>), baby aspirin, lovenox</li>
<li>Iron Deficiency: Switched from regular iron supplements to lactoferrin. (I take this one: <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OQGBY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"">Jarrow Lactoferrin</a> ) and take it with vitamin C to increase absorption</li>
<li>PAI-1 4G/4G: Lovenox, Metformin, Baby Aspirin</li>
<li>Celiac Disease: Strict gluten free diet</li>
<li>Elevated NK cells: Prednisone, Intralipids 1x a week</li>
</ul>

<p>We spent another month &quot;prepping&quot; for our IVF stim cycle by starting all the medications and interventions listed above and then rechecking my levels to make sure everything was where it needed to be prior to my stim cycle. Once we were satisfied with that, we started stims and had our retrieval. Even though I was hoping for a frozen transfer, my RI wisely insisted I prep for a fresh transfer just in case starting the day after retrieval. This is what ended up happening, so in hindsight I&#39;m glad he pushed on this. This was mostly just starting lovenox and intralipids. </p>

<p><strong>Mod approved update, potential trigger:</strong> After all this prep work and investigation, we did have success with our fresh transfer. My RI is continuing to supervise my care and I will be putting up a thread in <a href=""/r/InfertilityBabies"">r/InfertilityBabies</a> that details pregnancy care with an RI as my RI will begin to partner with my OB/GYN after I graduate from my RE.</p>

The issue: my spouse had been on hormone replacement therapy for the last 3 years and made the decision to stop taking them so we can try having a baby together.
