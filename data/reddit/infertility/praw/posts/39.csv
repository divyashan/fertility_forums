* 4 cycles of Clomid/Estrogen/Progesterone + Day 12 follicle checks
* 1 cycle of Clomid/Estrogen/Progesterone + Trigger + IUI
* 2 cycles of Femara/Estrogen/Progesterone (9DPO currently with the 2nd cycle)
* Sonohysterogram on March 1 = most painful experience of my life thus far, even surpassing having my skull drilled open with a hacksaw
* Normal FSH, Estradiol, Progesterone levels


So we met with Dude today and he was really nice - although I felt he was barely speaking above a whisper and I'm deaf in my left ear. I probably looked really interested in every single word he said since I had to do my right ear lean. He had a ""sperm bank"" sitting up on one of his shelves which I couldn't stop looking at. It was a giant white ceramic sperm with a smiley face. He was in his mid-sixties and seemed to know his shit (thankfully). It was nice to get a different perspective after dealing with our OB for the last few years....not that they didn't know their shit, but infertility clearly isn't their forte (is that how you spell that word? Autocorrect isn't doing its job and I really want to spell it 'for-tay')



He said he wanted to bump up my Femara dose to 5mg on days 4-8 (I had been taking 2.5 mg days 3-7) for a few more cycles and he wants to take out the Estrogen and Progesterone. He actually spent a good 20 minutes telling us exactly what Clomid and Femara both and how they react with Estrogen and Progesterone, so that was kinda neat. My husband and I both just thought ""they create more follicles....the end"" so it was neat to see what they do exactly. I'm supposed to start my period on Monday so I need to call on Day 1 and schedule an exam (I had no clue that they did that during our periods...what exactly do they ""check"" for?) and also he wants to do a genetic blood panel since I'm Ashkenazi Jewish - I guess to eliminate a few of those potential problems? I asked about my Crohn's that I've had since I was 6 and if that could cause issues. I've never had surgery for it and I don't take medications - my real method of controlling it has been just watching my diet. He said that Crohn's can potentially cause inflammation on my left side/fallopian tube (which happened to be the side that my OB had problems with during the HSN). He wants to potentially do a blood test to check my CA125 levels. He kept mentioning Endometriosis as a potential and I guess I'm really ignorant and uninformed when it comes to that because I just assumed you'd have some idea that there was an issue? My whole gynecological history is textbook with nothing outstanding or note worthy (standard 28 day cycles with no heavy bleeding, clotting, pain, cysts....) so the idea that that might be a potential seems nuts to me, but like I said, I clearly have an ignorant viewpoint for what constitutes the symptoms of Endometriosis....



So, that is where we are. He didn't mention anything about injectables which makes me wonder under what circumstances does an RE choose to go down that path? I feel better that he wasn't ""freaked out"" by anything in my history or anything that struck him as ""freak out"" worthy....so that is a bonus I suppose. How did y'all feel at this point in time? Any reassurances? Suggestions on what I should be considering or thinking? A little bit overwhelmed but also simultaneously relieved - kind of a fucked up mix of emotions....

Here is a post about IVF/DE treatments in the Czech Republic at Zlin, specifically.  I won’t go into detail about all of the things Susy already addressed in her very comprehensive post- so check that one out too.

First, Zlin is cheap.  And they post the entire price list online: http://www.ivf-zlin.com/24825-pricelist (Which is so, so nice.)

So IVF with an egg donor for me (in Euro): 4,500 for IVF/DE, 180 for PICSI, 200 to freeze “just in case” future sperm, 120 for Embryo Glue, and then 500 for a FET.  Meds there are cheap too. I spent less than 10k for my ENTIRE trip and frankly, we were a little indulgent with the fun stuff. (All Doctor fees, meds, hotels, food, airfare, tourist activities…)  We were there for 13 days for a fresh transfer (but we really did use this as a vacation- so you could certainly shorten that a bit.)  They require a $1000 deposit to be wired to them to secure the dates. 

During prep, you send the clinic information about yourself including several pictures of yourself and your donor preferences.  This includes: hair color, eye color, height, weight, age, known donor, education level, facial features that match you, body type that matches you.  Put what you want in an order of priority.  (For example, my spouse is Asian- so hair color was not important to me since his dominant gene would win anyway.)  All donors are anonymous.  It is a university town, so a lot of their donors are students or young mothers on their maternity leave.  

One challenge for me was genetic testing of the donor- I paid extra since my husband tested positive as a carrier for something.  This definitely doesn’t seem like the “norm” over there so it took a lot of effort to get done.

Traveling there takes a long time- Zlin is about a 4 hour train ride from Prague or a 3 hour train ride from Vienna.  The clinic offers an affordable (though not cheap) cab directly from the Vienna airport- less than 200 Euro.  But the train is easy enough and much cheaper.  Once you get to Zlin- the town is super boring though very cute.  The downtown is quaint.  They have a zoo and shoe factory museum. Honestly, the days I was in Zlin were appointment days anyway, so aside from a jaunt to the quaint downtown area, I spent most of my time at the hotel and reserved my traveling for the “off days”.  The clinic is at the top of a giant hill- so they don’t recommend you go up and down it post transfer. The clinic has a hotel in the same building.  It is REALLY nice.  The rooms are lovely and the staff all speak English and are fantastic.  They have a masseuse. The restaurant in the hotel has great food too and offers a “half board” discount. The best part is that after your transfer they literally wheel you back to your room.


The clinic is wonderful.  It feels clean, professional, and the customer service is excellent.  All of the staff are very kind. Zlin has a very specific schedule and have this science down to a science.  This makes planning very easy.  For example: First appointment on Wednesdays, retrieval and sperm deposit on Thursdays (spouse loved being able to do this in our hotel room)…You have a long weekend “off to travel”, and your transfer should be the following Tuesday. I was able to buy my airfare two months ahead of time.  You are only contacted once with an update with the amount of eggs retrieved and the amount of embyros that resulted.

I assume this may be all of CZ- but from my experience at Zlin- they are very technical when it comes to medical things.  For example, when you get your initial ultra-sound, you just walk in the room without pants and lay down.  Or when you are waiting for the transfer, you should wear a maxi dress or long pajama shirt because you will have to walk across a hallway without pants if you don’t.  

The top three clinics in CZ are Gennet, Brno, and Zlin.  

I strongly considered Gennet.  It is in Prague, so the travel would be a breeze. Plus, they have a program where the first time you go it full-price, the second time (assuming the first time didn’t work) it is discounted, and the third time (after those two fail) is free.  That sounded pretty great- except your spouse’s sperm has to be STELLAR to qualify (they don’t say this on their website.)

I ended up choosing Zlin because was the cheapest, the clinic is attached to a hotel, I was able to get seen the soonest there (could be due to the IVF coordinator I worked with- Sue-IVF traveler who may have gotten me in early- but hey!) and frankly, I have a IRL friend who went there and she is a research nut.  
But honestly, all of the clinics looked great.  

I hope this helps and would be happy to answer any questions.

I spent less than 10k for my ENTIRE trip and frankly, we were a little indulgent with the fun stuff. (All Doctor fees, meds, hotels, food, airfare, tourist activities…)  We were there for 13 days for a fresh transfer (but we really did use this as a vacation- so you could certainly shorten that a bit.)  They require a $1000 deposit to be wired to them to secure the dates. </p>

<p>During prep, you send the clinic information about yourself including several pictures of yourself and your donor preferences.  This includes: hair color, eye color, height, weight, age, known donor, education level, facial features that match you, body type that matches you.  Put what you want in an order of priority.  (For example, my spouse is Asian- so hair color was not important to me since his dominant gene would win anyway.)  All donors are anonymous.  It is a university town, so a lot of their donors are students or young mothers on their maternity leave.  </p>

<p>One challenge for me was genetic testing of the donor- I paid extra since my husband tested positive as a carrier for something.  This definitely doesn’t seem like the “norm” over there so it took a lot of effort to get done.</p>

<p>Traveling there takes a long time- Zlin is about a 4 hour train ride from Prague or a 3 hour train ride from Vienna.  The clinic offers an affordable (though not cheap) cab directly from the Vienna airport- less than 200 Euro.  But the train is easy enough and much cheaper.  Once you get to Zlin- the town is super boring though very cute.  The downtown is quaint.  They have a zoo and shoe factory museum. Honestly, the days I was in Zlin were appointment days anyway, so aside from a jaunt to the quaint downtown area, I spent most of my time at the hotel and reserved my traveling for the “off days”.  The clinic is at the top of a giant hill- so they don’t recommend you go up and down it post transfer. The clinic has a hotel in the same building.  It is REALLY nice.  The rooms are lovely and the staff all speak English and are fantastic.  They have a masseuse. The restaurant in the hotel has great food too and offers a “half board” discount. The best part is that after your transfer they literally wheel you back to your room.</p>

<p>The clinic is wonderful.  It feels clean, professional, and the customer service is excellent.  All of the staff are very kind. Zlin has a very specific schedule and have this science down to a science.  This makes planning very easy.  For example: First appointment on Wednesdays, retrieval and sperm deposit on Thursdays (spouse loved being able to do this in our hotel room)…You have a long weekend “off to travel”, and your transfer should be the following Tuesday. I was able to buy my airfare two months ahead of time.  You are only contacted once with an update with the amount of eggs retrieved and the amount of embyros that resulted.</p>

<p>I assume this may be all of CZ- but from my experience at Zlin- they are very technical when it comes to medical things.  For example, when you get your initial ultra-sound, you just walk in the room without pants and lay down.  Or when you are waiting for the transfer, you should wear a maxi dress or long pajama shirt because you will have to walk across a hallway without pants if you don’t.  </p>

<p>The top three clinics in CZ are Gennet, Brno, and Zlin.  </p>

<p>I strongly considered Gennet.  It is in Prague, so the travel would be a breeze. Plus, they have a program where the first time you go it full-price, the second time (assuming the first time didn’t work) it is discounted, and the third time (after those two fail) is free.  That sounded pretty great- except your spouse’s sperm has to be STELLAR to qualify (they don’t say this on their website.)</p>

<p>I ended up choosing Zlin because was the cheapest, the clinic is attached to a hotel, I was able to get seen the soonest there (could be due to the IVF coordinator I worked with- Sue-IVF traveler who may have gotten me in early- but hey!) and frankly, I have a IRL friend who went there and she is a research nut.<br/>
But honestly, all of the clinics looked great.  </p>

<p>I hope this helps and would be happy to answer any questions.  </p>

We went to a local urologist who doesn't specialize in fertility but he gave us some blood work results and basically said we should adopt because his FSH level is high. 

Here's an update:

We decided to get a free 2nd opinion through work which came from a highly specialized doctor in Houston. It was a phone call. 

He was very thorough and said that my husband's FSH level was only slightly elevated. (This gave us more hope than our original urologist) He recommended we see a world renowned urologist in Houston first and then see the specialized reproductive endocrinologist  (2nd opinion doctor) after we consult with the urologist in Houston which is several hours away. He recommended adoption only as a last resort to everything else. 

As for me - I have short luteal phase and I will definitely get tested for everything else.

BUT...

We already have a fertility appointment in San Antonio which is a few hours away. When I asked our second opinion doctor about San Antonio, he said San Antonio doctors don't specialize in male infertility even though they might say they do. He said that no one is the same caliber of Dr Lipschulz. 

Our San Antonio appointment is next week and we already have PTO approved for sick leave. The SA clinic will see us during the week the first visit but then can work with us to see us on weekends as we are able. The Houston clinic is weekdays only and will require a longer wait. BUT they do advanced procedures there and the man has a lot more experience. The trip to SA is a shorter trip but will cost at least $400 AND is next week. 


My husband only has 8 days he can take of PTO and we don't know how time consuming this journey will be. We both work full time jobs and go to school at night. 

We obviously don't want to waste time or money as TESE/ICSI/IVF and egg harvesting/cycle monitoring will undoubtedly be so expensive and we know it's a possibility we will be heading down that road. 

My mom thinks it's a no-brainer to go to Houston. My husband is overly stressed like me and just wants to know already if he has anything we can use for him to father a child because it's so stressful not knowing and having a plan. 

We are stressing so much - as I am sure you can understand!

I go in for my egg retrieval on Thursday morning. They get 38 eggs. Wonderful news! I go home that day and I'm sore, like super sore but Mr. Teh waited on me hand and foot. I took Friday off of work to recover thinking I'd be fine by Saturday or Sunday at the latest. 

No. 
        
My abdomen bloated so severely that walking became difficult, deep breathes were impossible and every moment was general discomfort. This will pass I thought.

How my anxiety has been overwhelming lately. How my stress is at a high. She never listens to all my thoughts because once I'm honest about how I've been feeling, it becomes an argument about how I am a pessimist. 

I try to explain that I am coming to her to talk through my fears and have some form of understanding. That I am scared of going through all these cycles and never having a child of my own. About how if medicine doesn't work, then I will have to pay out of pocket for IUI's and IVF and that it's terrifying thinking of how they may not be succesful. 

She tells me how I am being pessimistic. I should be more optimistic that there are more options even if the first one doesn't work. That I need to train myself to be more optimistic.

Sure I am happy about my new doctor that cares. I am excited to try all the options, and I am hopeful. However I am scared numb. My optimism isn't blind to the reality .f the situation. 

Just this past week I got a new doctor, told I could possibly have endometriosis on top of my PCOS, started my period, gotten a sonogram, scheduled my HSG, had to focus intensly on every word the doctor and nurse said, tried to decyfer them, got new prescriptions, on top of the day to day stuff. Word value it doesn't seem as terrifying as it was. I have to be prepared for bad news. I can't expect good news. 2 years of zero success doesn't allot you that ability.

However my mother blames my negative feelings on my not being optimistic. She says she gets how crippling it could be (she isn't infertile; no one in ny family is) but that I am focusing on it too much. 

All I have to tell her is I am feeling low and depressed about my infertility, and she tells me that.

Am I wrong to feel misunderstood? Is she right? 

I've had so much happen from the start of my trying to conceive journey. Misdiagnosis, months of bloodwork, a round of treatment with my doctor disappearing un-announced in the middle of, lots of tests, and so. much. waiting. I have plenty I am optimistic about and I talk about it, just no matter what there is the fear there, the constant reminder of my barron womb. It's hard to be positive about. 

All in all it's more stressful when no one around you can truely understand that, even your own mother. I just want to be heard for my fears and for them to be realized.

I am on day 9 of stims in my first round of IVF... and here are the things that happened today, point form, in chronological order:


- Husband guy and I woke up at 4:30am to leave the house by 5:30am to go to the fertility clinic for blood/ultrasound. We were the first patients in line, and I go in for the blood draw. I am a needle phobe, and the nurse is nervous because she is new. She barely pricks the skin, then chickens out and says she needs to get help, and I felt bad for her because my veins are really difficult for most good nurses. She got it done without issue, we all high fived.

- We then had to go pick up the moving truck rental because we need to finish moving our stuff out of the house we were renting (we found mould and then thousands of ants showed up so we decided to try to leave before IVF). On the way to picking up the moving truck, there was a man driving a few inches away from our back bumper, and then he suddenly swung out to go around our car and cut us off and slammed on his brakes. We came to a green light and all the cars in our lane were turning left.. and this man stopped, got out of his car, and began coming towards our car yelling profanities. I got my phone out to dial 911, and he yelled at me about recording him. I thought recording him was probably a good idea so I did that instead.. and he called me some very bad names, and then went back into his vehicle. It was a terrifying experience for me because I do not trust crazy people that instigate aggressive behaviour like that on the road.. there was a line up of cars behind us honking wanting to go, this person was at the front of the line, and got out of his car to start a fight at a green light instead of just going to his destination. It took me some time to calm down. I got so light headed that I thought I was going to faint. 


- We got to the moving truck rental place, and husband guy asks me to go in while he looks for parking. I tell him I can't, I am really shaken up about the crazy man and I'm not feeling well, and husband guy got annoyed, and then I started bawling. First crying fit of the day.


- We get to the place, husband gets a few of his friends to come help move the big stuff and I putzed around trying to be useful while I'm not allowed to do heavy lifting while my ovaries look like two bunches of grapes. There is a couple that husband guy is friends with that I am not super stoked on... the boyfriend in that couple is rarely very nice to me. I try to tolerate it because husband dude doesn't have a ton of friends.


- husband guy, at the end of moving stuff, for some reason gets on the topic of my heritage (I am anglo-Indian), and jokingly calls me a ""wannabe Brit"". I didn't say much because I was sitting a little further away from everyone and totally exhausted. Later, I tried talking to husband about it but he was busy trying to finish up odds and ends. I was becoming increasingly upset because I'm not a wannabe anything, except maybe a mother. I was getting really frustrated that he brushed it off when I tried talking to him


- I got emotional, and ended up making a FB post about the thing that was said to me while not directing it at him. y'know, one of those ridiculous passive aggressive complainy posts throwing shade. totally ridiculous. A lot of people commented validating my feelings. 


- husband's friends send me angry messages when we are on our way home assuming my fb post was about them. drama between everyone ensues. Lots of hysterical crying, etc.




It turns out my estrogen is getting high today and I have to go back to the fertility clinic tomorrow for blood/ultrasound. 


Is this normal? This level of bonkers? This IVF is making me 100% crazy, and I can't seem to get a grip on my emotions. Even when I warn someone before I see them that I am a crazy person right now and I sometimes burst into tears for no reason, they seem to go ""oh yeah I cried at a commercial when I was on my period, I guess this is like that but longer"" NO. NO IT IS NOT LIKE THAT. It is like having the hormones of 19 periods all at once. 

I would normally never ever make a social media post like that. I also never burst into tears at nothing. I also cried before my injections today. I just want this to be over. My stomach is so sore from needles, I am so bloated, I cried off waterproof mascara today. IVF is not for the faint of heart.

Found out Tuesday that FET#1 (PGS, 5AA, yadi yada) was a big fail. :( I stopped estrogen and vaginal progesterone on that day. My doc recommends hopping right into another FET without further testing at this point.

On Thursday morning my period started. I went in for my baseline Friday, on cycle day 2, and my lining was still well over 5. I started Estrace again Friday in preparation for a medicated FET cycle. But as of Friday afternoon my period seems to have stopped. I usually have regular periods that last 5-7 days.

Is my thick lining at baseline this cycle cause for concern? Did starting estrogen change my period length? I'm terrified of another FET fail (we only have 2 euploid embryos left) and would prefer to sit this cycle out if conditions aren't optimal. 

I'd be grateful for your stories or advice...

So my RE called me this afternoon - my CD28 progesterone is still low on my third cycle of clomid so I haven't ovulated (I could have told him that based on temps, but no~oo they always want the bloodwork). He's switching me to letrozole/femara in part because I'm not responding to clomid but also because apparently the company that makes clomid is no longer shipping to Canada so they're anticipating drug shortages??! Has anyone else heard of this? That seems wrong to me, especially considering Clomid is on the WHO list of essential medicines and last I checked Canada was a developed nation...

Anyhow, because of work scheduling I have one month in June when my usually crazy hours will not apply and I can come and go as I please, so if i'm not ovulating predictably/pregnant by the end of May i'm planning to ask if we can go all-in for just one cycle - injectables, triggers, IUI, twanding every single day if that's what it takes. Then at least I'll know we tried all we could for now (IVF is not an option for us for at least another 2 years). Still hoping it won't come to that. I'm usually the eternal optimist but I'm worried this infertility sh*t is going to beat it out of me.

Has anyone else heard of this? That seems wrong to me, especially considering Clomid is on the WHO list of essential medicines and last I checked Canada was a developed nation...</p>

<p>Anyhow, because of work scheduling I have one month in June when my usually crazy hours will not apply and I can come and go as I please, so if i&#39;m not ovulating predictably/pregnant by the end of May i&#39;m planning to ask if we can go all-in for just one cycle - injectables, triggers, IUI, twanding every single day if that&#39;s what it takes. Then at least I&#39;ll know we tried all we could for now (IVF is not an option for us for at least another 2 years). Still hoping it won&#39;t come to that. I&#39;m usually the eternal optimist but I&#39;m worried this infertility sh*t is going to beat it out of me.</p>

The full background: My AMH is 0.47, and my AFC is 5 (though I have also had baselines that saw 7-9). I have had two cancelled (converted) IVF cycles on max-dose antagonist protocols. The first produced one dominant follicle; the second produced two. Next up, we are going to try micro-flare Lupron, which I feel good about.

The other variable I'd like to consider tinkering with is my priming protocol. First round, I started on BCPs for a week, then added oral estrogen and testosterone patches (while continuing BCPs) for 10 days.  

This time, we scrapped birth control, which seemed like a no-brainer. I got an LH surge on day 7 of my cycle (my body is really into half-assed attempts at shedding my shitty eggs). The next day, I started estrogen patches and testosterone patches. After three days of estrogen patches, I left the third one on for seven days, and kept changing the testosterone patch daily for a total of ten days. At that point, I started Ganirelix injections, with the aim of preventing early follicle recruitment. Two days into that, I got my period, giving me a 20-day cycle. Baseline ultrasound showed two follicles at 5-6mm, but my left ovary wasn't visible. At day 7 of stims, I had five total follicles, but the stragglers didn't catch up. 

So, what do you think I should ask for next? More estrogen? No testosterone? Start the Ganirelix earlier? My doctor and I haven't discussed this yet, so I don't know what she's thinking, but I'd like to go in with ideas. I'm intrigued by [this](https://infertilityabsurdity.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/ivf-calendar.jpg) CCRM protocol-- any thoughts?

Finally, does your clinic have a go/no-go stance on baseline follicles? I kind of feel like this was doomed from the get-go and we shouldn't have wasted time and meds.

86,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"First of all, hello and thank you to all of you who have shared your stories and encouragement with Reddit-verse.   I have been a long time lurker and now I would like to ask for some advice and guidance.

Today, I am here for my sister.  In fact, I am the youngest of 3 sisters, and my middle sister is on my mind right now.  She is my best friend and my role model.  She struggles with PCOS, much like I do, and she has been having trouble conceiving for the past 3 and a half years (?).  I’m sure at some point I will be looking for support in this group when I start trying to conceive, but I am not even close right now.  (I’m 24, recently graduated and not ready…I’M NOT READY MOM!!)  But I digress, this is not about me, it’s about my sis.

Back story:

My oldest sister is the typical shiny, good-looking oldest sibling you would come to expect.   She blazed the trail for all greatness as far as my parents are concerned, and she is currently pregnant with her second baby.  She is due any day now.  She is also soaking up all of the attention that she can get, as she typically does, and reminds us all the time that it’s XX days until our nephew arrives.  (Thanks, we almost forgot….*eye roll*)

My middle (FAVORITE) sister has been married for about 2 years now.  She and her husband were trying to get pregnant before they got married and weren’t having any success.  They figured it would be best to start seeking out the appropriate doctors once they were hitched.  They were finally tested right before their first anniversary.  I am not familiar with many of the medical terms or procedures, but the doctor concluded that the issue has something to do with my sister’s PCOS.  Fast forward, they started IVF in February of this year.  Fast forward some more, they just received news that the first round did not work.

My sister and brother in law are devastated.  They’re also broke from shelling out so much money (SO MUCH MONEY) and I am sure that many of you can relate to that.  Yes, they were told that the second round was not only possible, but practically free (I think?) and yes I understand that many people have unsuccessful first rounds (so many of you probably think I am jumping the gun) but here is the tricky part: Our family.

My oldest  sister also suffered a loss in her life, her very first pregnancy ended at 23 weeks when neither of her twins had a heartbeat.  This was heartbreaking for all of us, and it completely consumed her in a dark cloud of sadness and anger for a long time.  We all dropped everything at that moment and rushed to her side, and I would not change that for the world.  Thankfully the older sis had a successful second pregnancy  a few years after that and gave birth to my beautiful niece, and is now pregnant with her second child and I couldn’t be more pleased for her…..

The part that is really difficult?  My older sister not only says the most condescending sh-t from time to time, but my parents lobby in her favor ALOT.  I am not trying to minimize her experience in any way, I would not wish it on anyone, however she loves to serenade my sister with these lovely “nuggets of wisdom” from time to time.  Like how to successfully conceive a child.  Because now she is the mother f**king expert on not only conception, but loss…  (“Start meditating”  “Start using essential oils”  “Stop Stressing out”  “Try to make a schedule”  “Have you done some research on natural methods?”  “Try watching Dr. OZ”  “If it’s meant to be, it will be!”)  AUUUUUGH!

One time, when my middle sister was sharing her concerns, my older sister actually asked her if my brother in law was “putting it in the right hole”.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW??  That started a BIG fight amongst us, and I ended up calling my older sister a c*nt.  (Tell me I’m wrong…do it.)  Needless to say my parents sided with the oldest, in spite of her tasteless remark because I had the audacity to use the “c” word.

I’m not trying to talk too much sh*t about my parents, in recent years they have been more vocal towards my older sister and have told her to cool her jets on many occasions.  They are also extremely loving and kind people, they just like to constantly push conflict aside and  bury it deep DEEP in the sand which I find irritating.  That may be why they took my sister’s side that one time…..anyway!

I digress…back to the original point.  My middle sister is devastated, to the point that she is barely eating and barely wanting to communicate.  I love this girl more than anyone on this planet, and admire her beyond compare.  I will do anything for her.  I send her texts that say “I love you”  “I’m thinking about you” and I am getting a response, but not much.  The fact that we aren’t talking much right now is killing me because I want to take all of the pain away from her and I can’t.  

What can I do for her?  How can I help her?  I have offered to wrap her up in a burrito blanket and spoon feed her chocolate ice cream while she watches Netflix, but she declined.  She says she is not sure if she has the energy to go through another round of IVF because of all the back and forth.  The shots were horrible for her.  She bruises easily….had a really rough time.

I feel like I have already talked way too much.  Please tell me.  I miss my sister.  I just want to help.

Tl;dr My sister is my world and suffered a mc after her 1st IVF round.  My family is supportive, but also not.  I want to help my sister and I need your help.

I'm trying so damn hard to stay positive, but I can't help but feel like the universe is going to take this opportunity to spit in my face. What would be more fun than giving a woman going through IF a negative beta on her 30th fucking birthday?

Upsides:

* I had already scheduled that day off from work, so if it's negative and I'm a fucking wreck because I've turned 30 with no progeny in sight (...we had originally planned to be *done* having kids by 30...), at least I don't have to put on a happy face at the office for a few days.
* I'll be seeing several of my favorite people the next day, so that has a decent chance of keeping me out of a really awful funk. And if it's bad news, I can drink with them, so that's nice.
* Since I have that day off, it'll be easier to fit in the endometrial scratch that we planned to do between cycles 15 and 16.

Negatives:

* Solid chance I'll be reeling from shitty news while having my birthday dinner with my well-meaning-but-not-well-versed-in-infertility MIL.
* Basically everything.

99,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, I'm pretty new here, but I found other people's posts about HSGs very informative and reassuring, so I'd like to add my two cents for anyone who is having one. This may be TMI, but I hope that my fellow type-A planners out there find it helpful.

**Financials**

My husband and I each have our own insurance through our employers, and neither covers infertility treatment. However, mine covers infertility *testing.* I had my fertility labs (CD 3 and 21) done through my ob/gyn a few months ago with good results. She didn't think an HSG was necessary until we were ready to try IUI/IVF, but I explained that my insurance only covers it as a diagnostic test and not in preparation for fertility treatment (this is specified in the insurance plan language). She agreed to order it now under a diagnostic test code so that I wouldn't have to pay for it during the IUI/IVF process, as the insurance would be less likely to question it coming from her than from an RE or fertility clinic.

My out-of-pocket cost is a $100 copay plus 20% ($102.85) for a total of $202.85. Based on the 20% fee, the insurance rate is $514.85. I live in Houston, TX and am having the procedure done by an RE at an outpatient surgery center that isn't affiliated with one of the big hospitals.

**Preparation**

The clinic didn't suggest that I take anything for pain until I asked, and they said 800mg ibuprofen would be fine. I found a leftover Xanax from my husband's LASIK surgery, and I'll take that with ibuprofen an hour before. I also have some homeopathic Bach Rescue Pastilles that a friend gave me a few years ago, but I don't know if they do anything. The clinic also said I should drink a bottle of water before I arrive so that I can provide a urine sample.

The scheduler suggested I bring socks, and she told me to be prepared to undress from the waist down. I'm wearing Spanx and a dress to work today, and I don't want to wrinkle it by bunching it up to my chest. This is what I packed:


* fluffy, cozy socks (I wish I had pineapple-print ones as a little joke that only /r/shittyfertilityadvice would understand.)
* long-sleeved cotton shirt to wear during the procedure 
* comfy cotton undies and pantyliner for spotting (will have to change into my Spanx again when I get to work, ugh)
* water bottle

**Procedure**
I was given a hair net, shoe covers, a gown, and a blanket. The nurse insisted I could keep my dress on and just ""roll it up."" It would have been so uncomfortable to lay on it bunched up under my back, and I'm SO glad I packed that shirt. I'm also grateful for the socks I packed, as they were more comfortable under the shoe covers than my 3"" pumps would have been! They do a lot of IVF procedures at this clinic, and I waited at least an hour for my procedure (I took a nap).

The procedure itself took less than a minute. The RE was wonderful and talked me through every step. She had some trouble finding my cervix, but that wasn't terribly uncomfortable. I followed someone else's suggestion and focused on breathing slowly and keeping my body relaxed. Reading the codes/words/etc. on the screen and looking around at the equipment helped distract me. The dye was the most painful part, and it really did feel like bad period cramps, despite the 800mg of ibuprofen I'd taken a couple of hours prior. I could tell the doctor was trying to be as quick about it as possible.

**Aftermath**
As someone else said, I wouldn't be anxious if I had to get another one. I didn't have any blockages, and the pain was tolerable (there was a point where I bit down on my blanket, but that was at the very end and it lasted only a second or two). 

Several hours later, I was insanely bloated. I felt like the Goodyear blimp. I don't know if it was related to the procedure, but I've never been that bloated in my life. I tried using the bathroom, but it wouldn't go away. Fortunately, I woke up feeling just fine. I wore a pad afterward and overnight, and I had hardly any spotting. 

I was told to avoid putting *anything* in my vagina for five days afterward in order to prevent infection. Unlike some other people, I wasn't prescribed antibiotics. Because I didn't spot anything that looked like blood, I assumed there hadn't been any damage/cuts to my cervix or uterus, and I felt comfortable having sex three days later. I'm glad I did, because that ended up being O-3. I'd read some anecdotes about HSGs throwing off ovulation, but I O'd right on schedule.

Good luck to any of you getting an HSG, and thank you to all who posted about your experiences before. I found several helpful posts by searching the sub, and they really helped me prepare and quell my anxiety.

This may be TMI, but I hope that my fellow type-A planners out there find it helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Financials</strong></p>

<p>My husband and I each have our own insurance through our employers, and neither covers infertility treatment. However, mine covers infertility <em>testing.</em> I had my fertility labs (CD 3 and 21) done through my ob/gyn a few months ago with good results. She didn&#39;t think an HSG was necessary until we were ready to try IUI/IVF, but I explained that my insurance only covers it as a diagnostic test and not in preparation for fertility treatment (this is specified in the insurance plan language). She agreed to order it now under a diagnostic test code so that I wouldn&#39;t have to pay for it during the IUI/IVF process, as the insurance would be less likely to question it coming from her than from an RE or fertility clinic.</p>

<p>My out-of-pocket cost is a $100 copay plus 20% ($102.85) for a total of $202.85. Based on the 20% fee, the insurance rate is $514.85. I live in Houston, TX and am having the procedure done by an RE at an outpatient surgery center that isn&#39;t affiliated with one of the big hospitals.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>

<p>The clinic didn&#39;t suggest that I take anything for pain until I asked, and they said 800mg ibuprofen would be fine. I found a leftover Xanax from my husband&#39;s LASIK surgery, and I&#39;ll take that with ibuprofen an hour before. I also have some homeopathic Bach Rescue Pastilles that a friend gave me a few years ago, but I don&#39;t know if they do anything. The clinic also said I should drink a bottle of water before I arrive so that I can provide a urine sample.</p>

I seriously just can't with these people.  My coworker's wife is expecting their first, and I'm happy for them in roughly the same way I would be if he came in and announced he'd bought a new Acura.  Like, sounds great dude, enjoy it and I'd be fine if I never hear another word about it. 

But that's now how its gone down.  It started when he showed up in my cube with an ultrasound pic and it's gone to hell from there.  

My department frequently uses a group chat software to communicate with everyone at once.  We use it a lot, for both work and sharing lighter stuff.  So it wasn't a shock when ole boy shared the ultrasound on the group chat.

It WAS a shock when he shared a video of their pregnancy announcement to their families - complete with soon to be grandparents weeping with joy (kill me).

It was also a shock when he shared their gender reveal video taken at their gender reveal party complete with special gender reveal cake.

And also when he shared their name reveal video you guys I am not making this up who even does that this is not a goddamn thing.  

I should mention that came out the day after I got my abysmally low AMH results, went home after work, and lay sobbing on the shower floor until long after I ran out of hot water.  

I promise, you guys, if I get a nursery reveal video or some other shit I am going to Go. Off.  You will see a viral video of some woman losing her shit at work and you will think ""Oh that must be PlumLion.""  I'd super appreciate if y'all would start a GoFundMe for my bail money because obviously I've spent all my money on pee sticks, bourbon, and bloodwork my insurance company won't cover.

I can't open my social media without being bombarded with other people's crotchfruit, I don't need that mess at work too.  One would think that working in a male dominated field would protect you from this kind of attention seeking, but one would be wrong.

And you guys, I feel bad for bitching because he's a super nice guy, really.  I know he'd feel terrible if he knew he was causing anyone distress.  But he's young, and his wife's young, and they got pregnant literally two months after they stopped BC and he probably just has no concept of how damn hard it is for some people.

While i find this sub often very comforting it's not a perfect fit for some of my issues. I also enjoy childfree but have issues with that sub as well and menopause has been helpful too. 

I have suffered miscarriages and am unable to carry a child. Now just adding to my pain I am going through menopause at 40. I jumped over the peri part and went full blown. I'm having a few hot flashes and lots of emotion turmoil but no period for 9 mo. For some reason this has sent me over the edge. My husband and I decided to be childfree after weighing the options. I felt I was fine with it but some how no kids+menopause is emotionally twisting me in knots. I sulk, I cry, I feel hurt, I feel envoys of others with families. We have friends/peers with young kids or still having babies. 

I just feel like I would like a place to vent where there isn't people still trying and hoping or happy because they don't have kids. Yes, I have good days. Yes, my husband is sweet but does not fully understand.

I've been on clomid for PCOS the last 3 cycles without success - 50mg led to O on CD39, 100mg to O on CD21, and this cycle on 100mg again no O by CD27. With these late O dates I figure I'm just ovulating by fluke and not really because of the clomid. 

My RE and I have been trying to avoid monitored cycles to this point because they really don't jive with my work schedule and requiring regular ultrasounds for an extended time would likely mean needing to take a leave of absence (which is... complicated). I'm wondering if there's an in-between option, a 'lightly monitored cycle' if you will.

I&#39;ve been on clomid for PCOS the last 3 cycles without success - 50mg led to O on CD39, 100mg to O on CD21, and this cycle on 100mg again no O by CD27. With these late O dates I figure I&#39;m just ovulating by fluke and not really because of the clomid. </p>

<p>My RE and I have been trying to avoid monitored cycles to this point because they really don&#39;t jive with my work schedule and requiring regular ultrasounds for an extended time would likely mean needing to take a leave of absence (which is... complicated). I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s an in-between option, a &#39;lightly monitored cycle&#39; if you will. </p>

<p>For those of you who have tried combining clomid+trigger shot, how did the frequency of ultrasounds compare to injectables+trigger shot? How about these protocols with IUI, does that make a difference? Any info would be much appreciated!</p>

I've been on Clomid for the past four cycles (50mg, 50 mg, 100mg, 150 mg); 100mg resulted in a chemical pregnancy and everything else has been BFNs. My CD12 ultrasounds have looked good from 100mg onward. There has always been at least one follicle that was big enough for a trigger within 48 hours.

I've heard of people not responding to Clomid and then making the switch, but I didn't know if I should stay on it since it's somewhat working.

**ERA #1** exactly replicated my failed FET cycle. Result: non-receptive by 1 day:

And I also posted this about ERA #1: no beta-3 integrin because I was non-receptive

https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5iat80/no_beta3_integrin_may_explain_a_lack_of/ 

**ERA #2** was one day later. Result: still non-receptive by 12 hours; included the discovery of latent endometriosis -- elevated BCL-6 found through the new Receptiva test.
https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5sq94r/round_2_era_and_receptiva_uterine_biopsies/

**ERA #3** was this last biopsy. Results below.

**Tests:**

1. Igenomix ERA (3rd time) - to test whether uterine lining is in-phase (The recommendation last time was 12 additional hours of progesterone). http://www.igenomix.com/tests/endometrial-receptivity-test-era/

2. Receptiva endometriosis test (2nd) - to see if recently discovered latent endometriosis could be treated effectively with letrozole. http://www.receptivadx.com/why-is-receptivadx-testing-important

**Results:**

1. Igenomix ERA #3 was RECEPTIVE! FINALLY. Halle-fuckin’-llujah. Turns out I need just 12 hours more than the standard 1 ML / day of PIO for 5 days. (This means PIO ass-shots in the morning, not at night.) I have no idea why the RE for transfer #1 did a half-dose on the first two days. I would encourage everyone with failures to double-check their progesterone protocol.

2. Receptiva endometriosis test: My BCL-6 level went down slightly, from 2.8 last time to 2.2 this time, thanks to letrozole (femara) treatment in the mock cycle. My latent endometriosis is stubborn. I’ve said before on this sub that I have a nonstick, teflon-coated uterus. I can now be more specific -- it’s endometriosis-coated. The good news is that there are bigger guns to bring in but the bad news is that it’s Depot Lupron which has a lot of side effects. However, these can be mitigated through birth control pills. And given my level is only 2.2 now I can apparently get away with only one month, not two. 

**Conclusion:**
I’m generally happier now because there’s now a concrete plan for doing transfer #2 at the beginning of June. And I now know my uterus has the ability to be receptive, at least so says the ERA, and we’ll take the big-guns approach to get rid of endo. I got my Depot Lupron shot and am taking birth control so no side effects yet.

I learned to take sufficient medication for a uterine biopsy -- 3 valium and 2 tylenol with codeine. I hope there’s no ERA #4 but I will definitely be repeating these drugs if it does happen.

My first transfer was last summer. I’ve spent nearly a year doing tests, getting bad news (clotting! immune! non-receptive! endo!), and looking for solutions. I hope I’ve uncovered the extent of the issues and found sufficient solutions so that transfer #2 will have a normal chance of success (50%-ish).

Though I never had classic endo symptoms like painful or irregular periods, I did always wonder why the unexplained infertility. I had not-amazing eggs, but not terrible eggs. Maybe endo was always the problem, or at least a significant part of the problem.

We had an informative meeting with our RE today and are trying to figure out next steps. We have some interesting decisions to make, and I would LOVE your advice. 

**What we've 'accomplished' over the last 2ish years of treatment**

* 4 IUIs (2 with Clomid, 2 with Femara) -- all negative
* Fresh transfer #1 -- transfer of *two* 3-day embryos -- CP
* FET #1 -- transfer of one blast -- negative
* FET #2 -- transfer of one 5AA blast -- CP

**What we've had tested**

After this second CP, our doctor ordered a bunch of tests -- an RPL panel, karyotypes for both me and Mr. Superfuntimes, a bunch of tests whose names I don't remember (the folate one, anticoagulant antibody tests, etc.). Everything came back normal (this was the subject of our meeting today).

We had all the standard pre-IVF tests too, back in the day. Everything normal. The only thing abnormal is that I have long, irregular cycles. I do get positive OPKs every month (although they're late, often CD18-23), and have a two-week luteal phase, so this may not actually have anything to do with the infertility shenanigans. My official diagnosis is some combination of ""unexplained"" and ""other ovulatory disorder.""

**Embryos on ice, and the big question**

We have 7 embryos in the freezer after IVF#2. The big question is, what's next? Do we just keep trying, or do we move into....

**The exciting options**

Or, as I said to the doctor today -- we have officially moved into Advanced Topics in Infertility. 

* *Endometrial Receptivity Assay (ERA).* /u/giantredwoodforest has shared a lot of great info about this, most recently in [this amazing post](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/62j7o8/info_post_why_did_my_embryo_transfer_or_fet_fail/). Our RE said that 80% of the time he does this test, it comes back normal. Involves a hormone replacement mock embryo cycle and a biopsy; costs about $1,000.
* *Letrozole + FET, in search of beta-3 integrins*. Also written about by /u/giantredwoodforest, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5iat80/no_beta3_integrin_may_explain_a_lack_of/). Essentially, I would use Letrozole to trigger ovulation, then do a FET.
* *Genetic testing of the 7 embryos on ice.* Yep, we didn't do PGS. (""You're both so young and healthy!"" Gaaahhhhh.) This is the most expensive of the options and of course, we could lose some embryos in the thaw/biopsy/refreeze process.
* *Just keep doing FETs until our embryos are gone and I have gone insane.* Or, I guess, one of them could actually work.  

Currently, we're leaning toward the Letrozole + FET option, as it's the least invasive. We've also been aiming for single transfers in our FETs so far (""You're both so young and healthy!"" OH REALLY, DOC) and we may up that to two for the next shot.

If you made it to the end, I am already grateful.

Hi all,

I'm new to this community, but not new to the world of infertility, albeit from a different slant: My non-redditor wife is a doctor in the US, soon to be completing her last stages of training as an infertility specialist.

She's starting to look for a jobs. I'm trying to help her find a good one.

I have read so many stories online about what the frustrations and failures patients experience through IVF. What I'm seeking to learn is this: what is it that makes an experience particularly negative? I know a failed embryo transfer is frustrating, but I'm sure there are things the doctors, staff, nurses, lab staff etc. do to help you (and your partner) through the rollercoaster ride. Likewise, there are things that feel like salt in the wound.

I know there is more to infertility than IVF, but it is such an expensive endeavor that I can understand why it is frequently the source of the most angst and anger.

I want to hear what makes you upset about your clinical experience; what makes you doubt your treatment plan; what makes you change clinics or seek a second opinion. 

On the other hand, what do you particularly love about your clinic? What makes you feel heard and individual?

In doing this, I hope to help her find a clinic that engenders qualities in its staff to provide satisfying, positive care to its patients.

I hope this is an ok place to post this. I'm very interested to hear your thoughts.

<p>What are the pros and cons of back to back vs taking breaks in between? My husband kind of wants a break, and I&#39;m leaning more towards shotgunning it. The sooner we get through the next two timed cycles, the sooner we&#39;ll be able to start IUIs. </p>

<p>I talked to a nurse today, and she said it&#39;s up to us but most just go back to back. I need some options! What did you do? </p>

For my second IVF cycle, I decided to take my own advice and see how much of a difference it made to buy pens in 300IU instead of 900IU. One downside of this strategy is most of the time you will have to do 2 gonal injections per day. I didn't mind since gonal is the easiest needle for me without burn or itching. A 300IU pen was $306 and a 75IU vial was $75. I'm not 100% sure on the cost of the 900IU pen but I think it was around $910.

I stimmed for 11 days at 300IU and 1 day at 175IU. I ended up needing to purchase 9 - 300IU pens and 3 - 75IU vials. Of the 9 pens the amount of overfill was:

- 37.5IU x1 (booooo)

- 50IU x1 (smaller boo)

- 62.6IU x5

- 75IU x2

= 550IU of overfill 

If I had purchased 900IU pens instead, I would have needed 3. They have about 75IU* of overfill in them = 225IU. By purchasing the 300IU pens, I got about 325IU more medication than purchasing 900IU pens =$325 in savings.

TL:DR - If you're OOP and at a high gonal dose (over 300), you can save a few hundred dollars purchasing the 300IU pens. If you're at a lower dose, it's probably not worth the extra pokes.

- Dad and I will be visiting you for 2 weeks when you have the baby in January 



- Have you thought about baby names



- Will you have a big gender reveal party



- You are going to be such good parents



- What if you have twins



- Can you pick the gender?




- In a store:  I want to buy that outfit for your baby.  




- she talked so loudly about her plans for her future grandchild(ren) that my 8 and 10 yr old nieces said ""oh my gosh, I didn't know you were pregnant aunt blessed!"" 





- (I know some of you are not like this and that's cool, but I'm an infertile lady who is still a sucker for babies- there is a 3 month old in the fam- and I wasn't shying away from my turn to hold her)  Look at you holding her,  just wait 9 months and you'll have your own.

Mr. Fishface finally acknowledged that he is worried about me. I'm usually non emotional and bounce back quickly, it just seems so hard this time.

156,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So I've been thinking about coming out on social media about infertility. I've had a few friends post vague allusions to IF in conjunction with pregnancy announcements. I'm now keenly aware that not everybody goes home with a baby and I feel it's important to say something now while still in the trenches so that I might be in a better position to (1) help others and (2) receive more support myself. Mr. Waffles is a little more private than I am so I will not post this without checking with him, which I haven't done yet. Not sure how he'll feel about it.

Have you come out about IF on social media? How did your SO feel about it?
Why did you want to come out?
Do you receive many more bingos/much more shitty fertility advice now that you're out?

I haven't even posted this yet and I'm already nervous. Here's my draft:
It's time for me to tell you about the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with.

It's been two years and nine months since Mr. Waffles and I began trying for a baby. We waited until we were ready. We have stable jobs. We can afford a child. We've been to Europe. All we have to show for our best laid plans are enough medical expenses to itemize on our taxes, endless disappointment and heartbreak, and several full sharps containers. It's desperately, terribly unfair. We have so much love to share.

Time is marked by the careful doling out of hormones, injected in precise amounts, in precise locations, at precise times. By blood tests and ultrasounds, poking and prodding. And waiting. So much waiting. Waiting to see if it worked, waiting to try it again.
It's profoundly tiring to live in an endless cycle of cautious hope and utter despair, measured out in two week increments and punctuated by endless driving to appointments and frequent medical interventions of varying degrees of invasiveness. It sucks and I hate everything and I'm so tired. So, so tired.

Waiting, waiting.

I have lived my life on hold for far too long. So difficult to commit to anything because certainly I'll be pregnant by then. The 200 mile relay race team I declined to participate on (the race was May of 2015), the soul sucking job I stayed in for 3 years too long (sure going to need all this sick leave I've diligently saved up), and countless projects left half finished and ideas unfulfilled. Nothing seems to hold my attention any more (see: stack of abandoned barely started novels on my bedside table and weed filled garden). I spent the entire winter in hibernation, on my couch with my weenie dogs. I'm not really sure who I am anymore. I miss my old swagger.

I try to convince myself: You are whole. You are strong. Sometimes it works.

But through it all I am enormously grateful for many things. Mr. Waffles and I are closer than ever. Not happier, but closer. I'm lucky to have a number of close friends who have supported me throughout this process. Friends, you heal my soul, truly. I started a new job in the fall which I enjoy and I have the privilege of working with an amazing team. Also on the bright side, my give-a-shit meter is completely busted which does excellent things for one's mental health.

So, so many blessings. It's just the one more...

Hope is a dangerous thing. The more you hope, the harder you fall. The longer you spend dealing with infertility, the easier it is to pretend you don't really care about the result or to expect that it won't work. Pessimism is excellent emotional bubble wrap. It gets harder and harder to pretend this is happening to someone else when boxes and boxes of needles and hormones arrive on my doorstep and Andrea the ultrasound technician and I are on a first name basis.

Despite the high incidence of infertility (1 in 8 couples), it is an utterly isolating, private pain. I have dreamed for months how I would tell you all about this after we had been successful. I pictured a triumphant message where I told you all about what we've overcome. But it turns out that happy endings aren't guaranteed for everyone. I decided it was time to be brave hoping that if there's anyone else out reading this and also struggling you know that you are not alone.

You might wonder how you can help. Please don't say you know it will work. No one knows that and there's no guarantee it will. Maybe you haven't reached out because you don't know what to say. That's ok. ""I'm sorry you're going through this. I don't know what to say, but I'm here,"" means a lot. Despite thinking of nothing else, I also may not want to talk about it. That's ok too. Despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, I still try and pretend this is happening to someone else.

More specifically, I want you to know that I always assume best intentions and I'm not easily offended, but when trying to be supportive of others with infertility, its best to avoid platitudes (""It'll happen when it's meant to happen!""), anecdotes (""My cousin was doing fertility treatments and after she stopped she got pregnant on her own!""), suggestions of home remedies (""My friend got pregnant after she started drinking raspberry leaf tea!"" This stuff tastes like absolute shit, by the way), and for god's sake do not suggest they ""just adopt."" Truly, you do not need to walk on egg shells around me, I am just trying to help you be supportive of all people struggling with infertility.

This morning I woke up happy, happier than I have been in a longgg time. My husband and I have decided to take a 12 month gap from our 3rd unsuccessful ivf (hoping next time will be successful if I get my physical and mental health on track). If next time doesn't work, as I appear to have an implantation issue, we are considering a surrogate path..  Coincidentally, today on FaceBooj I see that a friend  of mine (""A"") shared one of her friends (""B"") post about being a surrogate. B stated that she was in a court battle right now with the embryo parents as she wants access to her birth child whom is now 1.  Each to their own. I was reading through the post trying to understand the situation from B's side of offering her body up to help a friend in need only to feel betrayed when her friend cut her off after the birth (educating myself just so I don't offend anyone should I be needing to take this path in future). Everything was fine until I read her last few lines:
 ""this is why some people can't have kids. People like that don't deserve them otherwise they would be able to have their own. It's nature's choice not to let people like that procreate for the greater good of humanity"".

I have spent my entire adult life pushing to be a better person than I was yesterday. Today, I could have punched this B in the effing face. I have never felt a hate as strong as now. I have never been as angry and sad directly at a person. I know she probably didn't intend for ""people like that"" to read her post, but I read her post, and I am ""people like that"". What we have all been through to try and have a family is outrageous. I understand being a surrogate must be extremely taxing, but eff me so is fertility treatment. I know some truly amazing mothers, I know some truly awful mothers, and I especially know some amazing want-to-be mothers.

160,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"The idea for this thread grew out of another post on the daily. When dealing with infertility, being around pregnant people/babies/kids can be hard. Sometimes that can lead us to avoid situations or even some relationships entirely (e.g., ghosting on the pregnant friend). I’ve thought about this a lot and have reached a perspective that’s been really helpful for me in staying connected with friends through their pregnancies - including wanting to hear updates, compartmentalize my jealousy, and truly being happy for their successes. Thought I’d share in case some of these ideas are helpful to others. 

(1)	A big part of why I've fought to make peace with other people's pregnancies is that pregnancy is a part of life. I avoid it, in the end I hurt not only people who I love (who have done nothing wrong in getting pregnant), but I also hurt myself. Infertility has already taken so much from me, I don't want it to also take my friendships and/or my ability to celebrate major life milestones for the people I love. I can't control whether I ultimately have a bio baby, but I can limit the losses that infertility inflicts on my life.

(2)	To me, knowing that the path to parenthood can be a minefield makes successful pregnancies seem like a frickin' miracle. When the people I love are successful in pregnancy, I'm actually happier for them than I would be if I weren’t so familiar with all of the potential problems. It makes me grateful that they were able to get past those hurdles. But yes, it still sucks to see shitty parents with kids - it is absurdly unfair that they got so lucky. 

(3)	When I'm feeling jealous of friends/loved ones, I acknowledge my jealousy to myself, tell myself that it's normal to feel jealous, and make a conscious effort to separate it from my happiness for them. I just say to myself, ""yeah, I'm a little jealous, and that's natural and okay."" It helps to remind myself that I wouldn't actually wish my own situation on my friends. It also helps to remind myself that everyone has their own piles of crap to deal with in life - and in the grand scheme of things, I've been pretty damn lucky. It just so happens that infertility has been one of my piles of crap. 

(4)	 I remind myself that their pregnancies literally have nothing to do with my infertility. If they weren't pregnant, it wouldn't help me to get pregnant. It would just mean more people are dealing with this infertility BS. 

(5)	I talk openly about my feelings with my friends. Like one friend told me she was pregnant within two weeks of me having a D&E at 20 weeks for a severe neural tube defect. She had *just* peed on a stick for the first time and called me right away. That was hard, especially since I know too well that a positive pregnancy test does not equal baby (The 20 week loss was my second - I also lost another pregnancy with identical twins at 9 weeks). Still, I did my best to be happy for her and to separate my jealousy from what I actually wanted for her, which was to realize her dream of being a bio mom. A day or so later, she offered me some non-pasteurized milk that she wanted to avoid now that she was pregnant. It was apparently awesome milk (local, organic, etc), and she thought I might like it. I said, ""Thank you for the offer, but honestly, it hurt me. I know you meant well, but it just so clearly highlighted that I'm not pregnant anymore. I'm happy that you are, the contrast of you not being able to drink the milk while I can hit me hard."" We had an awesome talk - she acknowledged that my point of view was 100% reasonable, and even expected, and apologized profusely. She thanked me for sharing how I felt. She said she would do her best to avoid triggers, but if she slipped, she wanted to know so that she could make it right. That response meant way more to me than her initial slip up. People make mistakes, but how they handle the mistakes that matters to me.
 
In contrast, I have had to cut contact with one former close friend/cousin who was repeatedly and unremorsefully callous about my infertility.  I told her that her actions hurt me - multiple times - and she didn't change. So now that's it. We'd been like sisters throughout our lives, so the situation totally sucks. It still bothers me daily, but at least it wasn't me or my infertility that drove us apart - it was her increasing self-centeredness.  Ultimately that would have manifested some other way if not for my infertility, and in retrospect, there were many red flags that popped up in the several years before I finally cut ties. 

I say all of this while acknowledging that there may be times when you need space or certain situations that are just too much (e.g., baby showers), and that can be okay.

When dealing with infertility, being around pregnant people/babies/kids can be hard. Sometimes that can lead us to avoid situations or even some relationships entirely (e.g., ghosting on the pregnant friend). I’ve thought about this a lot and have reached a perspective that’s been really helpful for me in staying connected with friends through their pregnancies - including wanting to hear updates, compartmentalize my jealousy, and truly being happy for their successes. Thought I’d share in case some of these ideas are helpful to others. </p>

<p>(1) A big part of why I&#39;ve fought to make peace with other people&#39;s pregnancies is that pregnancy is a part of life. I avoid it, in the end I hurt not only people who I love (who have done nothing wrong in getting pregnant), but I also hurt myself. Infertility has already taken so much from me, I don&#39;t want it to also take my friendships and/or my ability to celebrate major life milestones for the people I love. I can&#39;t control whether I ultimately have a bio baby, but I can limit the losses that infertility inflicts on my life.</p>

<p>(2) To me, knowing that the path to parenthood can be a minefield makes successful pregnancies seem like a frickin&#39; miracle. When the people I love are successful in pregnancy, I&#39;m actually happier for them than I would be if I weren’t so familiar with all of the potential problems. It makes me grateful that they were able to get past those hurdles. But yes, it still sucks to see shitty parents with kids - it is absurdly unfair that they got so lucky. </p>

<p>(3) When I&#39;m feeling jealous of friends/loved ones, I acknowledge my jealousy to myself, tell myself that it&#39;s normal to feel jealous, and make a conscious effort to separate it from my happiness for them. I just say to myself, &quot;yeah, I&#39;m a little jealous, and that&#39;s natural and okay.&quot; It helps to remind myself that I wouldn&#39;t actually wish my own situation on my friends. It also helps to remind myself that everyone has their own piles of crap to deal with in life - and in the grand scheme of things, I&#39;ve been pretty damn lucky. It just so happens that infertility has been one of my piles of crap. </p>

I thought I'd introduce myself since it seems I am part of a new club that no one rally wants to be apart of but that is incredibly supportive. We had our first appointment at the RE 10 days ago (ironically day 1 of my cycle), and we are set up for IUI on Tuesday. I just went in today to get sonogrammed and they saw three eggs that are almost ready - I take the trigger shot tomorrow night. So far so good, but I'm being realistic because it probably won't happen this month. This is my first IUI. 

---- ok it felt great to type that out knowing you ladies will know EXACLY what I am talking about!!! That's the hardest thing about this is that unless you have been through it most women just shrug their shoulders at you - including my own mother.

Quick story share? The day LordFoxbriar and I went to the RE for the first time I told my mom I would call after the appointment to give her the scoop. I'm an only child and despite the miles between us I'm pretty close with my mom. I call after the appointment to let her know about the journey I'm about to embark on - before I can get the details out she says, ""is this an emergency? I'm at an office baby shower.""

Are you fudging kidding me?!?! I almost lost it ladies! It was all I could do to keep from crying. A coworkers fudging baby shower is more important than my trip to the RE?!?! 

She said she had to go and that she'd call back later. I was fuming mad I let it go to voice mail when she called back. I've come to learn that my mom doesn't get it. She never dealt with infertility and her generation didn't discuss it. Unfortunately she is not a person I can talk to about my journey. God bless LordFoxbriar for being supportive! 

Like many of the ladies here I was in denial about my infertility for a long time. It took me almost six months to pick up the phone can call the RE after my OBGYN said, ""yeah you're not ovulating and your husband has slow sperm."" But I'm so glad I did pick up the phone and call. I have opened up to some of the moms in my neighborhood about this (I teach private music lessons in my neighborhood so I know a lot of the families) and I have gotten so much love and support from the ladies. 

I was shocked how many women have dealt with infertility! We are all around each other and don't know it but it is nice to have an anonymous community like this to share our stories and feelings. 

I know I just started my journey into the world of infertility and no one wants to be here, but it looks like I'm in good company. I'm hopefully for gathering good data (so far I know I respond well to clomid!) this month and we'll make adjustments as necessary.

A few people requested that I make this a separate post. I’ll try to do my best to keep this up-to-date with new tips and bits advice as I encounter them. If you have a tip that's not here, please message me. This post still can be udpated!

I’ve been through a failed FET myself (after trying the old-ish fashioned way) and so I’ve been accumulating information about why FETs fail. Most of the information applies to fresh transfers as well. Some of it is applicable to (repeat) pregnancy loss.

Hopefully our hive-mind can help you move forward after your failed transfer. Also, wine and hugs.

First of all, I’m sorry if you’re reading this because you recently had a fresh or frozen embryo transfer (FET) that failed. Going through all of the steps and doing IVF is so hard. And then when it doesn’t work, it can be disappointing or devastating. After my failed FET, I found out that I have a ton of issues -- the FET never had a chance. I’m glad I did this testing.

The conventional wisdom about transfers is that you do 3 embryo transfers, it usually works, and if it doesn’t, then you do some testing to see if it was more than bad luck. That’s what many doctors recommend, and that may be right for you. However, you do have a choice in this. If you have a limited supply of embryos, don’t want to do more retrievals, are unexplained, have a sneaking suspicion there is something wrong with you, or are just not down with that, you have options.

Here is the range of reasons your transfer might have failed. Basically these fall into three categories: bad luck, problem with embryo (""seed""), problem with uterus (""soil""). I am not a medical professional but did read on the web site of a prominent clinic that 70% of failures are thought to embryo-related and 30% uterus-related. If you used a PGS/NGS-tested embryo, chances are lower it's an embryo issue and therefore higher it was a uterus issue.

**Category 1: Back luck**

* Bad luck! Plenty of that going around in infertility-land, isn’t there? Best case scenario, there's only a 50-70% chance of success (assuming PGS/NGS normal embryo) or more like ~30% for a non-tested embryo.

> Solution: Try again. Cross fingers.

**Category 2: Problem with embryo (“seed issue”)**

* Embryo had the wrong number of chromosomes - “was not PGS normal”. This is a very common reason why embryos don’t implant and miscarriages happen. 

> Solution: Try PGS testing (preimplantation genetic screening) a.k.a. CCS a.k.a. PGT-A (preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy) to check that the number of chromosomes is correct. A newer version is NGS (next gen screening). Note that PGS is not perfect -- sometimes an embryo can have the wrong number of chromosomes even if PGS had good confidence, and vice versa.

NOTE: There has been a lot of recent discussion of mosaicism, which means that there will be different DNA among different cells in a blastocyst. Here is a [good discussion of the PGS / PGT debate](https://www.fertilityiq.com/pgs-embryo-genetic-screening). PGT-A only samples cells from one part of the blastocyst. In a small number of cases, an embryo will be classified as abnormal even if most of the cells in the embryo might be genetically normal and the embryo could create a successful pregnancy. However, euploid embryos still result in the highest successful pregnancy rates. [Research](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-abstract/26/3/313/5764638?redirectedFrom=fulltext). Info about [egg quality and age](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216000662). 

* Embryo had another genetic defect, but at a more subtle level. PGS only tests the raw number of chromosomes, generally. There could be a balanced translocation, for example. This is rare. It can also cause miscarriages.

> Solution: Go to a genetic counselor. Consider getting a karyotype of your own chromosomes to see if there are any issues. If there are, instead of PGS, you’ll use PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis) to check if there’s a specific issue within one of the chromosomes. Again, note: PGS = check number of chromosomes; PGD = check specific issue within one chromosome.

* No or few embryos lasted to day 5. It's said that the strongest embryos are able to make it to day 5 (blastocyst) in a lab, and survive freezing and thawing. However, some embryos that did not survive in a lab could have survived in the uterus.

> Solution: Try a day 3 transfer -- often a fresh transfer. Maybe your embryos just don't do well with the lab culture, or your lab isn't great at growing embryos all the way to day 5 or the freezing/thawing process. Even though the chance of success is higher for a day 5 embryo, you may have more embryos available on day 3 and one of them may work.

* Lab or misc embryo issue: Maybe the embryo lab process wasn't perfect (e.g. thaw didn't go well) or the embryo had some sort of other issue (embryo didn’t hatch for some reason).

> Solution: Try again or try another lab.

* Transfer issue: Maybe the transfer didn’t go smoothly. Occasionally we see stories here of the embryo getting stuck in a catheter, etc. This is rare.

> Solution: Ditto above. Try again or another lab.

**Category 3: Problem with uterus / body (“soil issue”)**

* Embryo transfer done at the wrong time so your uterus was not receptive. Transfers are typically done after 5 days of 1 mL of progesterone (intramuscular injection or equivalent suppositories). Sometimes, a natural FET is done. Not everyone’s body responds to progesterone in the same way when preparing for a transfer -- some people need their transfer to be done sooner or later. Also, some doctors use nonstandard progesterone protocols -- such as ramping up from less than 1 mL per day which throws it all off. A study I read a while ago showed that 5 and 6 days of progesterone are equally likely to work - maybe you are a 6-day person.

> Solution: ERA (endometrial receptivity assay). The more failed transfers you have, the more likely your uterus was non-receptive You can have your doctor replicate the exact cycle that failed and see if the uterus was non-receptive. Your doctor gives you the same meds as your transfer, then takes a sample of your uterine tissue -- a uterine biopsy (note: do this with valium and tylenol with codeine; do not settle for ibuprofen). The current recommended ERA test is Igenomix -- it uses super high tech rather than older ERAs where they simply looked at cells under the microscope. Some have also tried the Yale Biopsy. If your test is non-receptive, Igenomix will tell you that you should repeat the test or do a transfer a specific number of days (or hours) earlier or later. Example: 1 day later, 12 hours later. This is your personalized embryo transfer window. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4601169/). The Igenomix ERA is rapidly going mainstream -- a paper about this test recently [won an award](https://www.igenomix.co.in/press-and-news/era-improves-pregnancy-rate-24-patients-38-years-old/) and their chief scientist recently received a [distinguished researcher award](https://www.igenomix.net/press-and-news/dr-carlos-simon-awarded-with-the-asrm-distinguished-researcher-award-in-usa/). [FertilityIQ](https://www.fertilityiq.com/embryo-transfer/when-is-the-era-test-appropriate#) recently did a write-up of ERA research to date -- maybe worth sharing with your doctor. If you are doing the ERA biopsy, I highly recommend checking for endometriosis at the same time. 

* Endometriosis.  Many women with unexplained infertility (I’ve heard 30-50%) are found to have endometriosis, even if they never experienced the classic endometriosis sign of painful or irregular periods. If you don’t have painful periods, your doctor will likely tell you that you couldn’t possibly have endo. This is false. It’s not entirely understood how endometriosis causes infertility, though there are theories. Some people with endo conceive naturally. It may depend on the location and amount of endometriosis. Others really struggle and it may prevent even IVF from working. Endo can also be associated with miscarriage. [Read my post about endo and infertility](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6iuayj/info_post_endometriosis_and_fertility/).

> Solution: Endo used to require a “lap” (laparoscopic surgery) to identify. Now you can check for elevated BCL-6 levels with a uterine biopsy and running a new test - see ReceptivaDx.com. This is a new test and your doctor has probably not heard of it -- it replaces the e-tegrity test because it includes beta-3 integrin plus BCL-6 which more specifically identifies endo. The good news is that endometriosis is treatable with drugs and/or laparoscopic surgery. If you’re doing IVF, a common treatment for mild endo is letrozole (aka femara)  before your next transfer or biopsy -- [see study](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/27/3/881/640603/Endometrial-receptivity-defects-during-IVF-cycles). If your BCL-6 levels are higher or don’t go down with letrozole, the next treatment is often i 1-2 months of Depot Lupron depending how high your BCL-6 levels are. To avoid side effects from Depot Lupron, you can take birth control pills. I've heard that Visanne is now being offered as an option or supplement to Depot Lupron depending on how severe the endo is thought to be. Orlissa may also be an option to discuss.

* Misc implantation issue: No implantation, no specific cause found.

> Solution 1: Consider an endometrial scratch. (NOTE: As of 2020, my RE says she doesn't believe in these anymore. Not sure of the research.) If you are already doing a uterine biopsy for the ERA or Receptiva endometriosis test, the biopsy itself performs the same function as a scratch. Some doctors believe in the scratch, others don't. It's generally considered low-risk and can be done in a doctor's office without anesthetic so it might be one of those ""no reason not to"" procedures, especially if you're already going in for a pre-transfer ultrasound. [Study about endometrial scratch](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6et4ht/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/)

> Solution 2: Try semen. If you have easy access to semen, this could be an easy/cheap thing to try. There is some research that semen in the uterus and vagina may help with implementation. [Study about semen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078039)

> Solution 3: Try Lactobacillus probiotics. This is a popular type of probiotics and is pretty cheap to buy. So why not try it? [Study about Lactobacillus probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27717732)

> Solution 4: Try HGH. There are a number of studies that human growth hormone can improve implantation rates in patients with repeated implantation failure. [Study 1](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjpp-2017-0786#.XwJXe5NKjPh) [Study 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779111/). There's also some evidence that HGH can help with your retrieval cycle -- see [Study 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5640074/) [Study 2](https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)00655-X/abstract)

* Progesterone issues: Your body isn't good at making or responding to progesterone. This can show up as luteal phase issues (spotting, short luteal phase) or endo. 

> Solution: Make sure your doctor gives you enough / the right type of progesterone. [Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d5ugl3/what_ive_learned_about_progesterone_in_general/)

* Infection: You have a bacterial infection that causes inflammation in the uterus (endometritis). 

> Solution: This can be identified with an endometrial biopsy or sometimes a hysteroscopy will show it -- there may be inflammation. Additional doses of the antibiotic doxycycline can be administered to treat the underlying bacterial infection. With many FETs, a dose of doxycycline is already administered but in some cases this is not enough to deal with the infection and you may not need to be given several weeks of antibiotics. [Research](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/72gbbs/journal_club_monday_topic_2_endometritis/)

* Blood clotting issue: You can get a blood test to see if you have Leiden V Factor, MTHFR, PAI-1, leiden factor, etc. Not all doctors believe in this for implantation issues, but some do. It can also affect miscarriage.

> Solution: Some are more serious than others, and are treatable with aspirin and/or blood thinners (lovenox). 

* Immune issue: There are a whole range of potential immune issues, both autoimmune and alloimmune -- natural killer cells, cytokines, all sorts of things. Not all doctors believe in Reproductive Immunology. A good overview of reproductive immunology is available from the Sher Clinic’s eBook. It used to be available for download for free, but it now looks like you need to book a consultation [more info](https://drgeoffreysherivf.com/basic-infertility-work/)

> Solution: The easiest, modern solution is intralipid therapy, which is pretty low-risk. It costs money but given the low risk may be worth trying. It’s an IV given in a doctor’s office, but it's designed to be given to people who are medically fragile so it's not very risky. Many folks are also put on steroids (methylprednisolone) so you can try that, too. Other (older, less popular) treatments for immune issues are riskier (IVIG, LIT, etc.). Maybe not worth it…? Others recommend anti-inflammatory diets to calm your immune system (gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, fun-free, etc.). That was no cure-all for me, but, sure, potentially low-risk or healthy for you anyway so maybe consider?

* Thyroid issue or other hormonal issue: Some say hypothyroid or hyperthyroid can lead to problems creating or sustaining pregnancy. High prolactin can also be problematic.

> Solution: Full thyroid panel. Testing only thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is not enough. Some want TSH to be below 2.5 for successful conception. They can give you replacement hormones to bring your thyroid hormones back to a normal level. High prolactin can also be treated with drugs.

* Physical abnormality in uterus or tubes. You may have blocked tubes, hydrosalpinx (google it), a bicornuate uterus, septate uterus, etc.

> Solution: Identify with saline sonogram, HSG and/or hysteroscopy. Maybe you already had some of these tests earlier in the process. Make sure you’ve done so. The solution will depend on your particular issue (it could include surgery).

). Note that it's from 2013 so some information may have changed since then.

**How to proceed**

If you’ve had one failed transfer, it’s very likely just bad luck, but as failures start stacking up, so does the likelihood that there’s something else wrong. If you want to do more testing, doctors may be resistant, but you can do it. It costs money and time, but it's possible. Also, a follow-up test is cheaper than another egg retrieval and often cheaper than a transfer. It’s up to you.

If your doctor isn’t comfortable with more testing, useful phrases are: “It would just make me feel better if we could rule out…” “How much would it cost to…” “I’m happy to pay for…” “I’d prefer to avoid more egg retrievals -- they’re so expensive -- so let’s try…” You can also get a copy of your medical record from your current clinic and get a second opinion from another doctor about what their theory is on what’s gone wrong.

There are probably more things that I forgot or don't know about. Please let me know and I’ll add them to the post! Thank you in advance. And best of luck with your next transfer. Take care of yourself in the meantime.



**The “kitchen sink” FET**

Maybe you want to do a FET where you do all of the treatments -- maybe it’s your last embryo or you’ve had failures and you want to know you gave it the best shot. Or maybe you’re looking for a checklist to see what to consider. Details about these are above.

* Seed: Start with PGS / PGT-A normal embryos, if you have any, though there is some research that some successful pregnancies come from PGS-abnormal or mosaic embryos. If you didn’t get PGS when you created the embryos, it is possible to thaw and PGS but this can damage the embryos. This post doesn't go into great detail about increasing egg quality, but strategies include different IVF protocols, HGH, DHEA (not with PCOS), HGH, CoQ10, etc. This post doesn't go into great detail about male factor infertility or treatments, but an RE or urologist skilled infertility issues could help.

* Prepare: The cycle before the FET, do a uterine biopsy -- this also functions as an endometrial scratch. On the uterine biopsy, have the following tests run: Igenomix ERA (to confirm FET timing) and ReceptivaDX (to check for endometriosis)

For the FET cycle, consider doing the following treatments - some doctors give these even if you haven’t had the testing to confirm whether you have these. Again, this is the “kitchen sink”:

* Lovenox and low-dose aspirin - to deal with any blood clotting issues

* Intralipid before and after transfer - to treat potential immune issues

* Methylprednisone (Medrol) - steroid for potential immune issues

* Letrozole (femara) - to treat potential undetected mild endometriosis (may be insufficient to treat more serious endometriosis) 

* Lupron (micro lupron not Lupron Depot) and BCP - calm down ovaries before FET, can potentially have some impact on mild endometriosis

* Doxycycline - antibiotic to clear any potential uterine infection

* Progesterone - especially if you have issues with endo, your luteal phase, or spotting, make sure your doctor gets it right",t2_10qlck,False,,0,False,Info Post: Why did my embryo transfer or FET fail?,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_62j7o8,False,dark,0.98,,public,77,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,77,,False,self,1594059672.0,,[],{},,True,,1490964331.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>EDIT: Last updated July 5, 2020</p>

<p>A few people requested that I make this a separate post. I’ll try to do my best to keep this up-to-date with new tips and bits advice as I encounter them. If you have a tip that&#39;s not here, please message me. This post still can be udpated!</p>

<p>I’ve been through a failed FET myself (after trying the old-ish fashioned way) and so I’ve been accumulating information about why FETs fail. Most of the information applies to fresh transfers as well. Some of it is applicable to (repeat) pregnancy loss.</p>

<p>Hopefully our hive-mind can help you move forward after your failed transfer. Also, wine and hugs.</p>

<p>First of all, I’m sorry if you’re reading this because you recently had a fresh or frozen embryo transfer (FET) that failed. Going through all of the steps and doing IVF is so hard. And then when it doesn’t work, it can be disappointing or devastating. After my failed FET, I found out that I have a ton of issues -- the FET never had a chance. I’m glad I did this testing.</p>

<p>The conventional wisdom about transfers is that you do 3 embryo transfers, it usually works, and if it doesn’t, then you do some testing to see if it was more than bad luck. That’s what many doctors recommend, and that may be right for you. However, you do have a choice in this. If you have a limited supply of embryos, don’t want to do more retrievals, are unexplained, have a sneaking suspicion there is something wrong with you, or are just not down with that, you have options.</p>

<p>Here is the range of reasons your transfer might have failed. Basically these fall into three categories: bad luck, problem with embryo (&quot;seed&quot;), problem with uterus (&quot;soil&quot;). I am not a medical professional but did read on the web site of a prominent clinic that 70% of failures are thought to embryo-related and 30% uterus-related. If you used a PGS/NGS-tested embryo, chances are lower it&#39;s an embryo issue and therefore higher it was a uterus issue.</p>

<p><strong>Category 1: Back luck</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Bad luck! Plenty of that going around in infertility-land, isn’t there? Best case scenario, there&#39;s only a 50-70% chance of success (assuming PGS/NGS normal embryo) or more like ~30% for a non-tested embryo.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Try again. Cross fingers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Category 2: Problem with embryo (“seed issue”)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Embryo had the wrong number of chromosomes - “was not PGS normal”. This is a very common reason why embryos don’t implant and miscarriages happen. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Try PGS testing (preimplantation genetic screening) a.k.a. CCS a.k.a. PGT-A (preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy) to check that the number of chromosomes is correct. A newer version is NGS (next gen screening). Note that PGS is not perfect -- sometimes an embryo can have the wrong number of chromosomes even if PGS had good confidence, and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOTE: There has been a lot of recent discussion of mosaicism, which means that there will be different DNA among different cells in a blastocyst. Here is a <a href=""https://www.fertilityiq.com/pgs-embryo-genetic-screening"">good discussion of the PGS / PGT debate</a>. PGT-A only samples cells from one part of the blastocyst. In a small number of cases, an embryo will be classified as abnormal even if most of the cells in the embryo might be genetically normal and the embryo could create a successful pregnancy. However, euploid embryos still result in the highest successful pregnancy rates. <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-abstract/26/3/313/5764638?redirectedFrom=fulltext"">Research</a>. Info about <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216000662"">egg quality and age</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Embryo had another genetic defect, but at a more subtle level. PGS only tests the raw number of chromosomes, generally. There could be a balanced translocation, for example. This is rare. It can also cause miscarriages.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Go to a genetic counselor. Consider getting a karyotype of your own chromosomes to see if there are any issues. If there are, instead of PGS, you’ll use PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis) to check if there’s a specific issue within one of the chromosomes. Again, note: PGS = check number of chromosomes; PGD = check specific issue within one chromosome.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>No or few embryos lasted to day 5. It&#39;s said that the strongest embryos are able to make it to day 5 (blastocyst) in a lab, and survive freezing and thawing. However, some embryos that did not survive in a lab could have survived in the uterus.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Try a day 3 transfer -- often a fresh transfer. Maybe your embryos just don&#39;t do well with the lab culture, or your lab isn&#39;t great at growing embryos all the way to day 5 or the freezing/thawing process. Even though the chance of success is higher for a day 5 embryo, you may have more embryos available on day 3 and one of them may work.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Lab or misc embryo issue: Maybe the embryo lab process wasn&#39;t perfect (e.g. thaw didn&#39;t go well) or the embryo had some sort of other issue (embryo didn’t hatch for some reason).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Try again or try another lab.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Transfer issue: Maybe the transfer didn’t go smoothly. Occasionally we see stories here of the embryo getting stuck in a catheter, etc. This is rare.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Ditto above. Try again or another lab.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Category 3: Problem with uterus / body (“soil issue”)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Embryo transfer done at the wrong time so your uterus was not receptive. Transfers are typically done after 5 days of 1 mL of progesterone (intramuscular injection or equivalent suppositories). Sometimes, a natural FET is done. Not everyone’s body responds to progesterone in the same way when preparing for a transfer -- some people need their transfer to be done sooner or later. Also, some doctors use nonstandard progesterone protocols -- such as ramping up from less than 1 mL per day which throws it all off. A study I read a while ago showed that 5 and 6 days of progesterone are equally likely to work - maybe you are a 6-day person.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: ERA (endometrial receptivity assay). The more failed transfers you have, the more likely your uterus was non-receptive You can have your doctor replicate the exact cycle that failed and see if the uterus was non-receptive. Your doctor gives you the same meds as your transfer, then takes a sample of your uterine tissue -- a uterine biopsy (note: do this with valium and tylenol with codeine; do not settle for ibuprofen). The current recommended ERA test is Igenomix -- it uses super high tech rather than older ERAs where they simply looked at cells under the microscope. Some have also tried the Yale Biopsy. If your test is non-receptive, Igenomix will tell you that you should repeat the test or do a transfer a specific number of days (or hours) earlier or later. Example: 1 day later, 12 hours later. This is your personalized embryo transfer window. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4601169/"">Research</a>. The Igenomix ERA is rapidly going mainstream -- a paper about this test recently <a href=""https://www.igenomix.co.in/press-and-news/era-improves-pregnancy-rate-24-patients-38-years-old/"">won an award</a> and their chief scientist recently received a <a href=""https://www.igenomix.net/press-and-news/dr-carlos-simon-awarded-with-the-asrm-distinguished-researcher-award-in-usa/"">distinguished researcher award</a>. <a href=""https://www.fertilityiq.com/embryo-transfer/when-is-the-era-test-appropriate#"">FertilityIQ</a> recently did a write-up of ERA research to date -- maybe worth sharing with your doctor. If you are doing the ERA biopsy, I highly recommend checking for endometriosis at the same time. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Endometriosis.  Many women with unexplained infertility (I’ve heard 30-50%) are found to have endometriosis, even if they never experienced the classic endometriosis sign of painful or irregular periods. If you don’t have painful periods, your doctor will likely tell you that you couldn’t possibly have endo. This is false. It’s not entirely understood how endometriosis causes infertility, though there are theories. Some people with endo conceive naturally. It may depend on the location and amount of endometriosis. Others really struggle and it may prevent even IVF from working. Endo can also be associated with miscarriage. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6iuayj/info_post_endometriosis_and_fertility/"">Read my post about endo and infertility</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Endo used to require a “lap” (laparoscopic surgery) to identify. Now you can check for elevated BCL-6 levels with a uterine biopsy and running a new test - see ReceptivaDx.com. This is a new test and your doctor has probably not heard of it -- it replaces the e-tegrity test because it includes beta-3 integrin plus BCL-6 which more specifically identifies endo. The good news is that endometriosis is treatable with drugs and/or laparoscopic surgery. If you’re doing IVF, a common treatment for mild endo is letrozole (aka femara)  before your next transfer or biopsy -- <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/27/3/881/640603/Endometrial-receptivity-defects-during-IVF-cycles"">see study</a>. If your BCL-6 levels are higher or don’t go down with letrozole, the next treatment is often i 1-2 months of Depot Lupron depending how high your BCL-6 levels are. To avoid side effects from Depot Lupron, you can take birth control pills. I&#39;ve heard that Visanne is now being offered as an option or supplement to Depot Lupron depending on how severe the endo is thought to be. Orlissa may also be an option to discuss.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Misc implantation issue: No implantation, no specific cause found.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution 1: Consider an endometrial scratch. (NOTE: As of 2020, my RE says she doesn&#39;t believe in these anymore. Not sure of the research.) If you are already doing a uterine biopsy for the ERA or Receptiva endometriosis test, the biopsy itself performs the same function as a scratch. Some doctors believe in the scratch, others don&#39;t. It&#39;s generally considered low-risk and can be done in a doctor&#39;s office without anesthetic so it might be one of those &quot;no reason not to&quot; procedures, especially if you&#39;re already going in for a pre-transfer ultrasound. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6et4ht/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/"">Study about endometrial scratch</a></p>

<p>Solution 2: Try semen. If you have easy access to semen, this could be an easy/cheap thing to try. There is some research that semen in the uterus and vagina may help with implementation. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078039"">Study about semen</a></p>

<p>Solution 3: Try Lactobacillus probiotics. This is a popular type of probiotics and is pretty cheap to buy. So why not try it? <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27717732"">Study about Lactobacillus probiotics</a></p>

<p>Solution 4: Try HGH. There are a number of studies that human growth hormone can improve implantation rates in patients with repeated implantation failure. <a href=""https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjpp-2017-0786#.XwJXe5NKjPh"">Study 1</a> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779111/"">Study 2</a>. There&#39;s also some evidence that HGH can help with your retrieval cycle -- see <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5640074/"">Study 1</a> <a href=""https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15"">Study 2</a>00655-X/abstract)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Progesterone issues: Your body isn&#39;t good at making or responding to progesterone. This can show up as luteal phase issues (spotting, short luteal phase) or endo. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Make sure your doctor gives you enough / the right type of progesterone. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d5ugl3/what_ive_learned_about_progesterone_in_general/"">Megathread</a></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Infection: You have a bacterial infection that causes inflammation in the uterus (endometritis). </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: This can be identified with an endometrial biopsy or sometimes a hysteroscopy will show it -- there may be inflammation. Additional doses of the antibiotic doxycycline can be administered to treat the underlying bacterial infection. With many FETs, a dose of doxycycline is already administered but in some cases this is not enough to deal with the infection and you may not need to be given several weeks of antibiotics. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/72gbbs/journal_club_monday_topic_2_endometritis/"">Research</a></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Blood clotting issue: You can get a blood test to see if you have Leiden V Factor, MTHFR, PAI-1, leiden factor, etc. Not all doctors believe in this for implantation issues, but some do. It can also affect miscarriage.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Some are more serious than others, and are treatable with aspirin and/or blood thinners (lovenox). </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Immune issue: There are a whole range of potential immune issues, both autoimmune and alloimmune -- natural killer cells, cytokines, all sorts of things. Not all doctors believe in Reproductive Immunology. A good overview of reproductive immunology is available from the Sher Clinic’s eBook. It used to be available for download for free, but it now looks like you need to book a consultation <a href=""https://drgeoffreysherivf.com/basic-infertility-work/"">more info</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: The easiest, modern solution is intralipid therapy, which is pretty low-risk. It costs money but given the low risk may be worth trying. It’s an IV given in a doctor’s office, but it&#39;s designed to be given to people who are medically fragile so it&#39;s not very risky. Many folks are also put on steroids (methylprednisolone) so you can try that, too. Other (older, less popular) treatments for immune issues are riskier (IVIG, LIT, etc.). Maybe not worth it…? Others recommend anti-inflammatory diets to calm your immune system (gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, fun-free, etc.). That was no cure-all for me, but, sure, potentially low-risk or healthy for you anyway so maybe consider?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Thyroid issue or other hormonal issue: Some say hypothyroid or hyperthyroid can lead to problems creating or sustaining pregnancy. High prolactin can also be problematic.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Full thyroid panel. Testing only thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is not enough. Some want TSH to be below 2.5 for successful conception. They can give you replacement hormones to bring your thyroid hormones back to a normal level. High prolactin can also be treated with drugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Physical abnormality in uterus or tubes. You may have blocked tubes, hydrosalpinx (google it), a bicornuate uterus, septate uterus, etc.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Solution: Identify with saline sonogram, HSG and/or hysteroscopy. Maybe you already had some of these tests earlier in the process. Make sure you’ve done so. The solution will depend on your particular issue (it could include surgery).</p>

We have passed 3 IVFs and 4FETs. We never got a positive test. I have varicoceles, she has hipothyreoids. This is our history

**1st IVF (2015)**
-13 eggs
-08 mature
-06 got to embryos

* #1 Fresh transfer with two ""A"" grade embryos D3
* #2 FET transfer with two ""B+""grade embryos D3
* #3 FET transfer with two 'B'grade embryos D3

In this first ivf we've gone from heaven to hell. We were young, athletic and, despite varicoceles and hipothyreoids, all our exams were good. And we did A LOT of exams. Painful exams, like Hysterosalpingography. We thought this were just a matter of probability/time...

**2nd IVF (2016)**
-14 eggs
-11 mature
-10 embryos

* #4 Fresh transfer with two D5 (blastocyst)
* #5 FET transfer with two B+ grade embryos D3 (lost 1 during defrosting)
* #6 FET transfer with two B- grade embryos D3 (lost 1 during defrosting)

At this point, after 6 unsuccessful attempts, we were as crazy as hell. We were thinking we were not capable. We were disappointed with ourselves and, in consequence, with our clinic and RE. We were exhausted, psychologically and financially (health insurance in Brazil does not cover any IVF attempts). We also tried alternative stuff like acupuncture, scratching, intralipids. We decided to do a long pause (almost a year).

**3rd IVF (2017)** 
-10 eggs
-06 mature
-02 got to embryos

We still had 2 embryos left from last IVF so we decided to get this 2 with the last 2 to PGS. We paid for it. In advance. We've changed our protocol to use pergoveris instead of gonal-f. We were sticking to the fact that less is more (quality). For the first time after the last 2 IVFs, all neddle stuff was fine. We were confident. We knew what to do. But, unfortunately, none of the embryos got to blastocysts. And we just got this news. Right now. As we speak. Or ""as I write"". We are in shock. We are uncertain. We do not know what to do. We do not have close friends to talk about it. Our family does not know of our problem. We do not have more money. We are afraid. And insecure. We need help. We have an appointment with our RE tomorrow. In 12 hours. What should we do?

**UPDATE**

just to keep everyone updated. Two days after the sad news (and this post) we passed through our RE appointment. It was better than expected, no one cried, but I've noticed tears in the eyes of my wife and also in the eyes of our RE. She seemed very committed to our case but, in the end, we are still on the ""unexplained field"" witch I think is one of the worst states of infertility. When you know your problem, you know what to do and you can line up a strategy, a plan. 

Me and my wife are still in a very sad mood. We talk about it, and we try to discuss future plans but we do not go deep because every moment we try to plan the next months we go deeper in sadness

So in order to speed up the process I thought I'd reach out to those of you who have gone through the process of giving up on your own genes to ask for help.

Some things I'm interested in:

* Any resources you've found useful (blogs, articles, journal papers,...) to help you in this process
* What was the process like for you in terms of how you went about processing the information? Any tips on what to do? (i.e. things that worked well for you or on the contrary that were for you a waste of time) things like talking to other people, therapy,...
* Tips for processing things as a couple when you start from different points in the journey and how you came to get on board with it
* Any concrete tips about clinics / banks to avoid / recommend. My clinic works with DonorEggBank USA. Also have been looking into reprofit, Brno which has come up a few times. I think this is the part that's the best 'documented' in previous threads so that one I'm a bit more aware of
* Anything else one should consider or not forget about?

Basically I'm trying to cheat the system by asking you to help kick-start my research, grieving process, coming to terms with it. I'm sure I'm not the only one who maintains lists of all resources I've looked at, so hoping one of you wouldn't mind core-dumping what they have.

I'm hoping this post could become somewhat 'permeant' to be added to the list of 'if you are considering the next steps in your journey, check here' like we have on the sticky thread for other parts of the journey.

I have just had a bad feeling about getting surgery without a second opinion. I have waited because I love my OB a ton. Last time I had the endo surgery (10 years ago) there wasn't even enough there to bother removing - so I'm a little unconvinced that this could be the issue now. Plus, I don't have any pain.

I did have my thyroid and 7DPO progesterone tested and it was normal. 

I will update after my follicle scan this afternoon. 





We are TTC #2 and going through secondary infertility. Just a little background....

1st child took 3 months to conceive. It was a normal pregnancy. 

Husband's sperm is normal

I'm on month 5 of Clomid - month 2 of trigger shot

Using progesterone. 

My question is I think we missed our window this month and I'm a little bummed. I have a follicle scan in the afternoon tomorrow, but I'm having O pains on the left side and my temp was 98.6 this morning. I'm on CD13 and I normal O on CD17 like clockwork (unless I get the trigger shot). 

I'm bummed because if we don't conceive this cycle then I'm going to have endo surgery for the next cycle and I was hoping to avoid that. 

Anyway, I'm here I guess.

Okay people, I need your help. My mom and I have been very low contact for a over a year, it's very complicated. But I asked her to give me space. So she only knows about my infertility through what very little I tell my sister, which isn't a lot because I know she'll tell my mom. She sent me this text this morning, and I'm not sure how to respond.


*""The thought crossed my mind that any challenge can be overcome if the solution is greater than the challenge.  And if the solution dwarfs the challenge then the quicker the challenge is overcome. 

I hope you will excuse the  uninvited invasion but I was considering the difficulty you guys have had getting pregnant.  

I think that by design our body systems are created to work together in harmony and support. When one system is shut down a cascade affect can be the result. Likewise one system can support and compensate for another to a point. 

I was thinking what might help and I have a few suggestions. 

Body brushing invigorates the endocrine system and gets it moving. It is extremely refreshing.  You'd love it. 

Organic lemon and water first thing in the morning after your night fast supports the liver and kidneys in releasing the toxins they've been cleaning from your system all night. 

Fenugreek is a tonic for female organs and can be used in tea although it's extremely bitter.  It's one seed that I sprout and add to my sprout salad and it is yummy and powerful. Way more powerful than herbal teas.

Living foods (sprouts) have a life force that when ingested support your own. Alfalfa sprouts are known to increase fertility. The Sprout People are an online resource that have a nice selection of seeds, supplies, and information.""*

My mom isn't a fan of modern medicine, though she's not totally against it. She just thinks the body can heal itself 99% of the time. She has no idea the last few weeks I've been taking drugs everyday for my first medicated cycle. 

I'm not sure what she would say knowing I've mostly focused on modern fertility treatments. I'm not totally against natural remedies though. I drink my raspberry tea, coq10, b supplement, etc. I already sprout, I love fresh sprouts they're delicious and yummy on sandwiches. But that's about where my level is at.

Here's why: *below is from an adoption cost search*


**The cost of working with an attorney and not involving an agency may range from $8,000 to $40,000 and averages $10,000 to $15,000. Families who choose to work with an adoption attorney on these independent adoptions typically take an active role in identifying the child they hope to adopt or a birth mother.**

 
So, I've decided that the next person who says that to me will receive a reply of, ""Here's how much it costs, when can I expect a check in the mail? Because if you are this interested in it, I expect that you're the one who will be paying for me to buy a baby, right?"" Seriously. Friend, family member, at this point, I do not care. If anyone says that to me one more time, I will let it all out.

 
Because that is essentially what I would be doing-buying a baby. Isn't that illegal in most countries? Oh but not this one, because they slap an ""adoption"" sticker over the ""purchase"" stamp, and what do you know! It's legal now!

 

And IVF? **We. Cannot. Afford. It.** So, sweet aunts of mine, just because you can pay for it, doesn't mean I can.


I'm not a baby mill. I don't exist simply to pop kids out. So, stop acting like I am not a real FUCKING woman unless I carry a kid to term. And stop telling me, ""You could have had that baby, if you had done this differently."" 


Stop posting things like, ""THIS is love-opening baby shower gifts with your husband."" 


No-love is that husband holding your hair back while you vomit, and he's having to hold his hand over his mouth because the sound of YOU throwing up is making him have to throw up. Love is having a shouting match in the laundry room, and he misspeaks, and says, ""....it's not like I did that on porpoise,"" and all you can think to say is, ""WHALE?"" Which then makes you both bust out laughing and he grabs you and holds you while you cry and say you're sorry for saying what you did about him. And his mom. Love is when you fight, and got to bed angry, right when a thunderstorm is starting up, and lightning flashes...and you feel a hand on your shoulder and a barely audible, ""Shhhh, it's okay, I'm right here,"" behind you.


But most of all, love is that husband holding you while you cry when you just got another BFN and you are on Day 42 of your cycle, and you still haven't started your period yet.

Can flu shots help women get pregnant?

Vol. 355, Issue 6331, pp. 1247-1248
DOI: 10.1126/science.355.6331.1247

As a veteran of three in vitro fertility (IVF) procedures, or cycles, Melody Vopni was accustomed to injections. She'd gotten used to giving herself 40 or more shots of drugs that up the ovaries' production of eggs, as well as the more painful shot that spurs ovulation. “It has a 1.5-inch needle,” says Vopni, 35, a former flight attendant who lives in Austin, Texas. “It is intimidating.” So when doctors at the Center for Human Reproduction in New York City told her that getting another injection could boost her odds of getting pregnant, she agreed. “What's one more shot, right, and this one I didn't have to give to myself,” she says.

Vopni joined one of two clinical trials that are now trying to determine whether an unlikely measure—giving women flu shots before they begin an IVF cycle—can improve IVF's success rates. Norbert Gleicher, the chief scientist of the Center for Human Reproduction, and colleagues launched the trials earlier this year. They argue that the vaccinations will increase the chances of implantation by spurring the woman's immune system to accept the embryo, inducing what researchers refer to as immunological tolerance. “If our hypothesis is correct, we should see better implantation rates in the IVF cycle and fewer miscarriages,” says Gleicher, a reproductive immunologist.

Given that a single cycle of IVF typically costs more than $15,000, but less than one-third of the procedures result in healthy babies, any increase in effectiveness would have a big impact. This strategy “is really novel and exciting, and it has the potential to deliver some benefit,” says immunologist Sarah Robertson of the University of Adelaide in Australia, who isn't connected to the trials. But the approach also faces skepticism, deepened by the poor track record of past efforts to boost reproduction by manipulating the immune system.

For decades, scientists and doctors assumed that the relationship between the embryo and the mother's immune system is hostile. Like a transplanted organ, the argument went, an embryo is a foreign body teeming with unfamiliar molecules, known as antigens, that rile up maternal immune cells. To prevent the baby from being destroyed in the womb, the mother's body has to turn down the immune system for 9 months.

Data suggesting that flu vaccine shots during pregnancy reduce stillbirths or premature births have led researchers to launch two clinical trials evaluating whether such immunizations may also help women using IVF become and stay pregnant.

Methods to reduce miscarriage risk were supposed to aid this process. One entails dosing women with the same immune-suppressing corticosteroids that prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. Although some fertility doctors still use this method, claiming that it improves pregnancy chances for IVF, Robertson dismisses it as “not safe or effective.”

Another, more contentious approach was the brainchild of Alan Beer. Nearly 40 years ago, Beer, then an OB-GYN and researcher at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, began performing a procedure called lymphocyte immune therapy (LIT). LIT involved injecting white blood cells from the father into the would-be mother to prevent her immune system from attacking the embryo's foreign antigens. It didn't work, a 1999 study by researchers at the University of Chicago and other institutions concluded, and in 2002 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration put a stop to its use as a fertility treatment in the United States.

With the flu shot trials, Gleicher and colleagues predict, there's a better chance of success because the approach meshes with new understanding of the immune system's relationship with reproduction. “What's emerging is that you must have a strong and active immune system for healthy pregnancy,” Robertson says.

As scientists have learned, the immune system orchestrates key steps in reproduction. A surge of inflammation-promoting molecules helps refurbish the lining of the uterus into a cozy home for the embryo, for instance. Nine months later, another rush of these molecules helps incite labor.

Researchers also have developed a more nuanced concept of tolerance, a detente between the mother's immune system and the embryo. Tolerance doesn't mean turning off the immune system, they have realized. “Pregnant women are not immune suppressed,” emphasizes reproductive immunologist Gil Mor of Yale School of Medicine. Instead, he says, the immune system remains vigorous but learns not to target antigens on the embryo.

A series of recent studies gave Gleicher and colleagues the idea that flu shots could promote tolerance. One 2016 paper, for instance, reported that stillbirths were half as common in women who received a flu shot during pregnancy.

Another study, also published in 2016, determined that women in Laos who had gotten the vaccinations were 41% less likely to give birth prematurely. Gleicher proposes that the shots work by stimulating molecular pathways that keep tolerance from breaking down too soon. And, he asks, “If influenza vaccination can have this effect late in pregnancy, why should it not have this effect early in pregnancy as well?” The injections, he and his collaborators thought, might help induce tolerance and improve the odds in IVF.

In one of the new studies, women will receive a flu shot or a placebo injection 10 days before they begin an IVF cycle. The researchers will evaluate whether the women who got the real vaccines were more likely to become pregnant. They will also monitor levels of immune molecules in the women's blood to determine if tolerance ensued. The second trial will follow the same procedure except that the women seeking to become pregnant will receive embryos created from donor eggs instead of their own eggs. To be sure that they detect any benefits, the researchers hope to enlist other fertility clinics and study nearly 1500 women. Funding for the trials comes from the Center for Human Reproduction and the Foundation for Reproductive Medicine, a New York–based nonprofit.

Because organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization endorse seasonal flu vaccines for pregnant women, the trials are not putting the participants in any danger, Robertson and Mor say. (In fact, all the women will ultimately get the vaccine.) And if the trials find positive results, fertility clinics could start offering the shots immediately.

But Mor is skeptical of the strategy. The immune system doesn't become universally benign during pregnancy, he says. It only becomes tolerant to specific antigens on the embryo. “The vaccine doesn't have those antigens,” Mor says. And even Gleicher admits that any impact on fertility will be limited because researchers suspect that only about 15% of miscarriages result from lack of tolerance; most occur because the embryo has chromosome abnormalities, which the flu shots won't affect.

Vopni, who received her first shot in January, was one of the first patients in the trial to undergo IVF. She did not get pregnant. Maybe the flu shot made no difference for her, or maybe she received the placebo. “I wish it had worked,” she says, adding that she doesn't regret participating. “It was like, ‘What could it hurt to give it a try?’”",t2_rw6qj,False,,0,False,Interesting clinical trial mentioned in Science today,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_61sz4a,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1490658861.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Copied below, since paywall - an interesting clinical trial that is currently running to test using flu shots to alter immune response in women undergoing IVF.

<p>As a veteran of three in vitro fertility (IVF) procedures, or cycles, Melody Vopni was accustomed to injections. She&#39;d gotten used to giving herself 40 or more shots of drugs that up the ovaries&#39; production of eggs, as well as the more painful shot that spurs ovulation. “It has a 1.5-inch needle,” says Vopni, 35, a former flight attendant who lives in Austin, Texas. “It is intimidating.” So when doctors at the Center for Human Reproduction in New York City told her that getting another injection could boost her odds of getting pregnant, she agreed. “What&#39;s one more shot, right, and this one I didn&#39;t have to give to myself,” she says.</p>

<p>Vopni joined one of two clinical trials that are now trying to determine whether an unlikely measure—giving women flu shots before they begin an IVF cycle—can improve IVF&#39;s success rates. Norbert Gleicher, the chief scientist of the Center for Human Reproduction, and colleagues launched the trials earlier this year. They argue that the vaccinations will increase the chances of implantation by spurring the woman&#39;s immune system to accept the embryo, inducing what researchers refer to as immunological tolerance. “If our hypothesis is correct, we should see better implantation rates in the IVF cycle and fewer miscarriages,” says Gleicher, a reproductive immunologist.</p>

<p>Given that a single cycle of IVF typically costs more than $15,000, but less than one-third of the procedures result in healthy babies, any increase in effectiveness would have a big impact. This strategy “is really novel and exciting, and it has the potential to deliver some benefit,” says immunologist Sarah Robertson of the University of Adelaide in Australia, who isn&#39;t connected to the trials. But the approach also faces skepticism, deepened by the poor track record of past efforts to boost reproduction by manipulating the immune system.</p>

<p>For decades, scientists and doctors assumed that the relationship between the embryo and the mother&#39;s immune system is hostile. Like a transplanted organ, the argument went, an embryo is a foreign body teeming with unfamiliar molecules, known as antigens, that rile up maternal immune cells. To prevent the baby from being destroyed in the womb, the mother&#39;s body has to turn down the immune system for 9 months.</p>

<p>Data suggesting that flu vaccine shots during pregnancy reduce stillbirths or premature births have led researchers to launch two clinical trials evaluating whether such immunizations may also help women using IVF become and stay pregnant.</p>

<p>Methods to reduce miscarriage risk were supposed to aid this process. One entails dosing women with the same immune-suppressing corticosteroids that prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. Although some fertility doctors still use this method, claiming that it improves pregnancy chances for IVF, Robertson dismisses it as “not safe or effective.”</p>

<p>Another, more contentious approach was the brainchild of Alan Beer. Nearly 40 years ago, Beer, then an OB-GYN and researcher at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, began performing a procedure called lymphocyte immune therapy (LIT). LIT involved injecting white blood cells from the father into the would-be mother to prevent her immune system from attacking the embryo&#39;s foreign antigens. It didn&#39;t work, a 1999 study by researchers at the University of Chicago and other institutions concluded, and in 2002 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration put a stop to its use as a fertility treatment in the United States.</p>

<p>With the flu shot trials, Gleicher and colleagues predict, there&#39;s a better chance of success because the approach meshes with new understanding of the immune system&#39;s relationship with reproduction. “What&#39;s emerging is that you must have a strong and active immune system for healthy pregnancy,” Robertson says.</p>

<p>As scientists have learned, the immune system orchestrates key steps in reproduction. A surge of inflammation-promoting molecules helps refurbish the lining of the uterus into a cozy home for the embryo, for instance. Nine months later, another rush of these molecules helps incite labor.</p>

<p>Researchers also have developed a more nuanced concept of tolerance, a detente between the mother&#39;s immune system and the embryo. Tolerance doesn&#39;t mean turning off the immune system, they have realized. “Pregnant women are not immune suppressed,” emphasizes reproductive immunologist Gil Mor of Yale School of Medicine. Instead, he says, the immune system remains vigorous but learns not to target antigens on the embryo.</p>

<p>A series of recent studies gave Gleicher and colleagues the idea that flu shots could promote tolerance. One 2016 paper, for instance, reported that stillbirths were half as common in women who received a flu shot during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Another study, also published in 2016, determined that women in Laos who had gotten the vaccinations were 41% less likely to give birth prematurely. Gleicher proposes that the shots work by stimulating molecular pathways that keep tolerance from breaking down too soon. And, he asks, “If influenza vaccination can have this effect late in pregnancy, why should it not have this effect early in pregnancy as well?” The injections, he and his collaborators thought, might help induce tolerance and improve the odds in IVF.</p>

<p>In one of the new studies, women will receive a flu shot or a placebo injection 10 days before they begin an IVF cycle. The researchers will evaluate whether the women who got the real vaccines were more likely to become pregnant. They will also monitor levels of immune molecules in the women&#39;s blood to determine if tolerance ensued. The second trial will follow the same procedure except that the women seeking to become pregnant will receive embryos created from donor eggs instead of their own eggs. To be sure that they detect any benefits, the researchers hope to enlist other fertility clinics and study nearly 1500 women. Funding for the trials comes from the Center for Human Reproduction and the Foundation for Reproductive Medicine, a New York–based nonprofit.</p>

<p>Because organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization endorse seasonal flu vaccines for pregnant women, the trials are not putting the participants in any danger, Robertson and Mor say. (In fact, all the women will ultimately get the vaccine.) And if the trials find positive results, fertility clinics could start offering the shots immediately.</p>

<p>But Mor is skeptical of the strategy. The immune system doesn&#39;t become universally benign during pregnancy, he says. It only becomes tolerant to specific antigens on the embryo. “The vaccine doesn&#39;t have those antigens,” Mor says. And even Gleicher admits that any impact on fertility will be limited because researchers suspect that only about 15% of miscarriages result from lack of tolerance; most occur because the embryo has chromosome abnormalities, which the flu shots won&#39;t affect.</p>

<p>Vopni, who received her first shot in January, was one of the first patients in the trial to undergo IVF. She did not get pregnant. Maybe the flu shot made no difference for her, or maybe she received the placebo. “I wish it had worked,” she says, adding that she doesn&#39;t regret participating. “It was like, ‘What could it hurt to give it a try?’”</p>

My cousin is 40 years old and having all the tests done because she and her husband have decided they want to try to have a baby, but she knows at her age it could pose a challenge.  She has only been TTC for a few months, but decided to go ahead and get a full spectrum of tests done (I told her how lucky she is to be in a country with govt. healthcare where most of this will be covered for her - including IVF treatment if needed!)to prepare for the possibility or find out if she will need fertility treatments.  (She seems to think she will probably need ART but that's not been confirmed yet.) 

While discussing the increased risks of birth defects and issues with pregnancy after 40 and her options she said something that got me thinking. Do people (without known fertility issues) ever decide to do IVF due to the advantages it could offer women of ""advanced maternal age""?  

We got on the subject thanks to discussing the PGS/PGD testing option, though that's not the only reason.  We both have fears (probably like many women) of getting pregnant only to find three months down the road that there is a genetic defect or problem that makes the pregnancy non-viable. I won't go into lengthy medical histories but there are a few things in her husband's family that makes her worry about genetic issues a little more than most. The issues aren't anything on their own that the doctor thinks would require IVF for medical reasons. (I know some people that have specific known genetic conditions chose IVF to ensure those genes are not passed on to their children, but her case is not one of those.)   

But the idea that pregnancy via IVF could remove that so many dangers/issues before ever getting pregnant is very attractive (even with all you have to go through to do IVF a viable, healthy baby is the most important thing and if IVF increases those odds the BS would be worth it.) 

So I come to this thread with its encyclopedic knowledge to ask if AMA pregnancies with IVF are known to be healthier/more likely to be viable than natural AMA pregnancies - or is there really no difference? (This would be IVF with your own eggs, not DE) 

I've looked everywhere online but can't really find any information on this or data that compares the two. (It could be out there but I just can't find it if it is.)  Have any of your RE's ever commented on the advantages of IVF's pregnancies via natural conceptions?  Any suggest that IVF increases the chances of a healthy, viable pregnancy of women of AMA?

Dear Friends, I am sharing this post for anyone who needs some hope...(6 miscarriages of 7 embryos, both own and donor eggs, and failed adoption)... I was totally hopeless and trying to get used to the idea of a child-free life (not-by-choice). I had no more motivation in life.

In September 2016, only one month after the failed adoption, I found out that I am spontaneously pregnant (11 weeks).  Finally, my baby boy was born at 37w5d. He is a real miracle. He safely arrived after 6 pregnancy losses and 7 babies, after 5 years of a long struggle and he was conceived naturally with a dysfunctional left ovary and a blocked right tube. He is my 8th color of the rainbow and my first baby on earth. You are so strong women! You are all warriors! I know how hard it is. I am hugging you all and sending you lots of baby dust.

My husband and I just found out it's pretty inevitable that we cannot have our own biological children. He had cancer as a child and the doctor says it looks like the treatment zapped his reproductive system. 

If we tried TESE-ICSI(Testicular / Epididymal Sperm Aspiration/Extraction - Intracytoplasmic sperm injection), that's the only ultimate way to know if we truly can, or cannot, have his biological children. He is really not wanting to do that, as it seems like a huge gamble: financially, time-wise, and emotionally.

So, the next step here is talking about adoption and sperm donation. Adoption could theoretically take longer (years of waiting versus months to a year?), and we have only been married about a year. We do want to adopt, but we thought that adoption might be second to sperm donation.

Basically, what we are looking for are stories from people who have either gone through the process of third party assisted reproduction with sperm, or have begun to do so: what it takes to get there - time to wait, cost of procedures, etc. We have zero answers and no clinics we trust locally, so we will have to travel for our appointments. We are also not finding a lot of luck on website mentioning 3rd party assistance. They only seem to really talk about egg gametes.

My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant since she stopped her depo shot about a year and a half ago. It took some hormones before her period came back at all, and then several rounds of clomid and letrozole before she her period was regular.

We've had positive ovulation tests in the past but the fertility clinic we go to has told us that those are likely false positives as her progesterone has been tested around 3-5 after positive ovulation tests.

About two weeks ago we tried an ovulation trigger for the first time with timed intercourse and we were both really hopeful, but we just found got a negative result from the clinic. Not pregnant again.

We were planning on moving to an IUI next time, but the doctor just told my wife that she wouldn't expect any different results with an IUI than she would with just the ovulation trigger and told my wife to start thinking about IVF.

We're most frustrated about the lack of information that we're getting. My wife had what the nurse called ""a beautiful follicle"" when she got her last ultrasound before the ovulation trigger, and  the nurse seemed really hopeful that this could be the time. I've been tested as well and everything looks good on my end.

Since everything looks good for the both of us why aren't we pregnant? I obviously don't expect any answers here; I just need to vent.

I know everyone moves at their own pace, but I think part of the reason I feel that way is that I'm not moving as fast as I want to be moving.

I started seeing the RE in January 2016. Had testing that month. Unexplained. Didn't start treatment until the next cycle, which is pretty standard.

Since then I've had 13 cycles. Two were annovulatory. One was a super early ovulation which screwed up the next cycle because I didn't have my meds yet. Two were benched for cysts. Five were technically treatment cycles, though only three made it to trigger (two with TI, one IUI). The other two were cancelled due to a weird response that wasn't deemed worth saving or just no response on the correct side. Two were sat out voluntarily due to traveling/holidays. Two (including one of the annovulatory ones) were lost due to hypothyroidism diagnosis.

The original plan was 3 medicated TI and 2 IUI with injectables before moving on to IVF. I expected that to take about 9 months, allowing a couple of months for resting in between some cycles. It's been 14 months now and I still haven't finished that second IUI. I'd hoped to be starting IVF about now, based on my expected timeline.

And it's not like it's just one thing that we can 'fix'. The stumbling blocks are all over the place.

I've mentioned this in the senior dailies, but I'm planning on going after donor embryos next to try to minimize the fuckery my body can get up to. IVF just gives too much opportunity for that. I'm so tired of 'weird' things happening every damn time I try to take a step.

https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5flldc/professional_advice_dealing_with_infertility_and/?st=J0N8XCHK&sh=c59ad2d9

TL;DR: I wanted to ask my manager to reduce my hours from 40 to 32 without a reduction in pay (in lieu of a raise that he hinted at). 

Well, after posting I did bring this up with my manager and today - OVER THREE MONTHS LATER - he finally had an answer for me... which was no. 

I thought they might negotiate with me - I.e. Maybe 10% reduction in pay rather than a proportional 20% reduction. Or maybe they would let me do 35 hours or something. As I said to him, I know I will still be doing the same amount work. So I really feel like a 20% reduction in pay is not reflective of the work I will be doing. 

I guess our company has a corporate program in place for this type of thing, and if you go through the program, you have to reduce salary by 20% in order to reduce hours.  Otherwise my department would have to make an special exception for me... which they are not comfortable doing outside of the corporate structure. 

I am embarrassed but I cried in my meeting. I can't help it, I am so disappointed. We can't afford to take a hit like that to my salary. At the same time, I feel like I am barely making it through each week  and my performance is suffering. I overslept twice this week and have been struggling to make it in at a consistent time. I really feel like if I could have an extra day off to handle the shit show that is my life right now, I would be able to come in and give 100% the 4 days I am at the office. 

So I will talk to HR about this corporate program - there are apparently options other than reducing hours- but I have really lost hope that there will be anything helpful to come out of it. 

I feel like a whiny asshole bc I know there are worse problems to have and I have a good job and am lucky for the flexibility they have given me so far. But it still just sucks. 

As the cherry on top, my manager offered that I could take off for the day after the meeting... it was already 5pm. Wow, thanks! 

I went to the grocery store after work and just had tears streaming down my face like a freak. I then had a birthday dinner to go to for my (pregnant) friend where I proceeded to order an entire bottle of wine. I shared it but am such a lightweight the birthday girl had to be my designated driver for the ride home. Not my best moment. 

Thanks for listening. Time for me to pass out while watching Bob Ross on Netflix and thinking zen thoughts.

[You can see it here](http://imgur.com/a/tPEqj)  Looking at the report, the motility is quite low, but from what I understand, everything else isn't too bad.  The viscosity is abnormal, but the RE didn't seem to be concerned about that so I'm not sure what to think.

I was not able to join him at the appointment with our RE, but the RE was extremely negative.  Basically told my husband we will never conceive without IVF, which is not an option for us financially.

He started him on Clomid, but said that would only increase with volume and that it probably won't be of much help.  He said he didn't really believe in supplements being able to improve things that much, and that the motility number was so low that any lifestyle changes wouldn't be able to make a dent in those numbers.

Of course, my husband is devastated.  The RE said we should do an IUI in 2 more months, but that we shouldn't really expect anything.

Does this sit ""right"" with you all?  Should we resign ourselves to not being able to conceive without a miracle?

Maybe I'm just being optimistic or uninformed, but from what I've read, it seems like there is still a chance we could get the motility number up with supplements, Clomid, etc.

I'm thinking that we should start him on Fertilaid and their motility booster, plus the Clomid.  Regarding lifestyle changes, he quit smoking about a month ago and has cut back on alcohol, hot tub, etc.  He is overweight and could stand to eat healthier, so we'll start on that as well.  I'd like to do another SA in 3 or 4 months to see where we are.  But is this plan just a pipe dream?  Or has anyone had success raising motility by a good amount?
