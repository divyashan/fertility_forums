24,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I’m trying to be a “single mom by choice” (I think that’s the trending term for it) and am getting ready for an embryo transfer with a fresh donor. I, of course, have a lot of feelings about it.  While my head already knew a donor egg was the next path for me after 4 unsuccessful IUI cycles, my heart took a minute to get there. Reading about other people and their beautiful journeys, I am so onboard and ready for the journey to continue.

My fertility clinic said that some people write a thank you note to the egg donor. Well, that makes sense, but I don’t know how to express my gratitude. I mean- there’s a 24 year old taking shots, and pills, and having appointments and she doesn’t even get a kid out of all of it. Sure there’s financial compensation, but that’s an incredible sacrifice! While truly feel that way, I have to be honest and say that there’s a little part of me that, deep down in places you don’t talk about at parties, is still feeling hurt and betrayed by my own body.  And that little part of me is spouting off like a boozy white girl saying “oohhh you’re 24 and have so many extra eggs you decided to give ‘em away. Oooh look at you all ‘what should I do with all these perfectly healthy eggs?!’”

I, of course, have a lot of feelings about it.  While my head already knew a donor egg was the next path for me after 4 unsuccessful IUI cycles, my heart took a minute to get there. Reading about other people and their beautiful journeys, I am so onboard and ready for the journey to continue.</p>

<p>My fertility clinic said that some people write a thank you note to the egg donor. Well, that makes sense, but I don’t know how to express my gratitude. I mean- there’s a 24 year old taking shots, and pills, and having appointments and she doesn’t even get a kid out of all of it. Sure there’s financial compensation, but that’s an incredible sacrifice! While truly feel that way, I have to be honest and say that there’s a little part of me that, deep down in places you don’t talk about at parties, is still feeling hurt and betrayed by my own body.  And that little part of me is spouting off like a boozy white girl saying “oohhh you’re 24 and have so many extra eggs you decided to give ‘em away. Oooh look at you all ‘what should I do with all these perfectly healthy eggs?!’” </p>

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

It's finally time to say hi. I'm mid-30s and based in the US. We've been trying for a year and I've had two first term MCs. Following the second one, I decided to do ALL the testing. Most of the blood test results are back and everything came back negative except the karyotype which returned a very low rate of 47,xxx meaning a few of my blood cells have an extra x. 😬😳

My RE said we should finish the testing (saliene US and testing for infection in the uterus) but she thinks our underlying cause is generic. Both of my MCs were at home so I wasn't able to have them tested.
 
We're still waiting for some more tests, but the current take is that we could either try again without intervention with extra close observation or go straight to IVF. She suggested IVF with PGS to improve our odds and reduce the chance of additional MCs. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Or gotten similar results? What did you decide to do and what happened?

I'm 25 years old, have endometriosis and had my left ovary removed when I was 19. A couple years ago I had surgery again, this time to try to treat my endometriosis and was told it had advanced to stage 3. That's when I started struggling with the aspect of possible infertility. I remained hopeful that many people still conceive with stage 3 endo and with one ovary.

Then two months ago, my husband and I were at a restaurant and I had a sharp pain in my right side. We left immediately and he took me home to rest. I assumed it was a terrible flare up. In addition to the pain, I started feeling dizzy and sick. He wanted to take me to the ER but I said it would pass.  I fell asleep and pretty soon I woke up in horrendous pain. We knew I needed to go to the ER ASAP but I couldn't move and he couldn't move me without hurting me. He called 911 and paramedics came and took me to the hospital.

On the way there I knew I likely had a ruptured cyst. I passed out several times. At the hospital my husband had to explain to the doctor what was going on because I was too weak and in too much pain. Tests confirmed what I feared and I was taken back for emergency surgery. When I woke up, the doctor didn't say anything but I could tell it was bad. I said ""It's gone, isn't it?"" He nodded and explained there was no way my ovary could be saved. I sobbed and sobbed and they had to give me medicine to help calm me down. This was my greatest fear.

I've struggled with guilt that maybe if I would've went to the hospital sooner, my ovary could've been saved. I have frequent episodes of anxiety that feel like panic attacks. My depression that had been gone for awhile has returned. Sometimes when I'm in my room, I get flashbacks of waking up vomiting and in pain. The paramedics coming in and wheeling me out. When I hear sirens I think about the ambulance ride. Small things remind me of that night and I get filled with immense anxiety, anger and sadness. The night I found out I will never bear a child and grieved for what I thought might have been.

I knew I was struggling but didn't know how much it consumed me until last weekend when I broke my ankle and was back at the ER. I remembered laying there, going in and out of consciousness and hooked up to a bunch of IV's. The terrible conversation I had with the doctor when I woke up. As I was waiting to get my ankle x-rayed, I just wanted to get up and leave because I didn't want to be there. I was so overwhelmed with emotions.

My husband is struggling too but tries to be strong for me I think. He has been so amazing and such a rock. I'd be lost without him. I still feel guilty and I also feel guilty that I haven't provided him with as much support. He's suggested I/we go to counseling but sometimes I feel like talking about it will be too painful. I'm sorry this is so long but I wanted to share my story and maybe seek support from people I thought may understand. I hope that's ok. I've mentioned to a few people how things about that night trigger me and how painful and overwhelming the emotions are. I know they'll never say it to my face but I can tell sometimes they think I'm exaggerating or overreacting.

So there's separate sections that are ""Births per retrieval (first transfer)"", ""Births per additional transfer (frozen)"", and ""Births per new patient"" and those are broken down by age group.

So my first question.  ""Births per additional transfer (frozen) - LIVE BIRTHS PER SECOND OR LATER EMBRYO TRANSFER"". Based on the definition they have on their site which is long, but is my understanding correct that it is the statistics for any transfers that happen after the first transfer in the first IVF cycle?

* So for instance, if I had 5 embryos after one IVF cycle, any transfer aside from the first transfer would fall into this category?
   * Therefor the 4 other embryo transfers would all fall into this category?
   * Or does the one year thing in their definition mean that as long as it's transferred within 1 year of retrieval, then it's still considered first transfer regardless of what number embryo it is
      * ie - if somehow all 5 embryos are transferred in a 12 month period, they're all part of the  ""Births per retrieval (first transfer)"" category)?
* AND if there were any IVF cycles after the first, ALL transfers from any of these IVFS would also fall into this category?
   * Or would the first transfer from each following IVF fall into the Births per retrieval (first transfer) category?

So for the clinic I'm looking at for people <35 (and I browsed all over the general vicinity and the numbers are pretty similar), the percentage of live births goes up for each of those discrete categories. So ""births per retrieval (first transfer)"" is at 36.6%, ""births per additional transfer (frozen)"" is at 49.5%, and ""births per new patient"" is at 66.0%. But I guess I don't understand this.

* Aren't all the first transfers going to be new patients?
* Or is ""births per retrieval (first transfer)"" actually the first transfer for every IVF cycle?
* So what does it mean when the statistics for new patients is that high? Does that just mean someone going through their first IVF cycle has a statistically higher chance? Or that a new patient within the year regardless of number of cycles or transfers has a statistically higher chance?

We used the same antagonist cycle as usual, though the Dr tweaked the amount of Menopur and Omnitrope slightly.  The cycle started out surprisingly positive. Day 2 E2 = 33, FSH = 9.79 (highest E2 I've had so far over all my non-estrogen primed cycles).

On trigger day there were 11 follicles (of various sizes), E2 = 1663. Post-trigger day monitoring showed we did the trigger shots correctly (Pregnyl & Lupron both intramuscularly).

But the next day the Dr only retrieved 2 eggs. Out of 11 follicles.. We were devastated, and our doctor kept saying he didn't know why this happened. He made sure to flush the follicles to get everything.

I've been trying to look up info online on whether this could've been a protocol issue, or maybe a fluke? Seems like the retrieval and triggers were both not question, and the high estrogen level meant the eggs should've grown. The only thing I found that may apply says that DOR patients have a higher likelihood of having empty follicles..

Is there anything else I can investigate?

&#x200B;

I'm 35F and husband is 34M. Primary factor is believed to be severe MFI (under 1M), but now based on embryo quality issues we don't know if there's something else going on.  We tried for a year before seeing an RE, then didn't like the first dr's approach (and weren't ready to dive straight into IVF) so did a year of lifestyle modifications, supplements, acupuncture, etc to at least try to get his numbers and quality up a bit.  He was referred and still sees a urologist, and has been on clomid and hcg to increase testosterone levels, as well as supplements.  #s have gotten a little better, but pretty much plateaued.  Have been back with the RE for a year (same clinic, different dr).  All my numbers were good.

&#x200B;

First cycle was antagonist with estrace priming. 7 retrieved, 6 mature, 5 fertilized, 1 made it to freeze and genetic testing came back as trisomy 21.  

Second cycle was antagonist with BC priming this time, and meds were increased a bit. 11 retrieved, 8 mature, 7 fertilized, 3 made it to freeze and testing came back as another trisomy 21, a high-level mosaic, and 1 normal.  Clinic closed for COVID so when we reopened I had to re-do the SIS, found a polyp, and had hysteroscopy to remove. Following month did a FET where lining and bloodwork was great, embryo was great, and it failed.  

Third cycle my RE switched up the protocol more - still did BC priming since that seemed to work better with my second cycle, but did a microdose lupron flare (2x/day) and upped my other meds again (150 menopur & 300 gonal).  The intent was to ""play the numbers game"" -- if I had been getting good fertilization and decent blast rates, but embryo quality was later poor, let's just push to get more eggs to start with.  However, third retrieval got 10 eggs, 8 mature, 7 fertilized, they were still developing at day 3, but then zero made it to freeze.

&#x200B;

I'm talking with my RE next week and want to understand what options she thinks we have for a different protocol.  My initial bloodwork was good when we started at this, but I want to know what they've still been checking at monitoring and see what we need to revisit or look at anew.  Whatever plan they come up with, I'm at the point where I also want to shop it around for a second opinion.  I also want to follow up and talk with their genetic counselor, so I can understand more about our high-level mosaic and if that's worth trying.

&#x200B;

My husband also has a urologist appt on Monday so he'll ask if there's anything else they can look at.  We haven't done DNA fragmentation testing but I do want to see if that's an issue.  The urologist thought it'd be fine to check, but that it would only mean lifestyle modifications that he's already doing. I also asked our RE about this, and if their lab could do different sperm selection (chip etc) if high fragmentation turned out to be an issue, and it doesn't sound like they do this.

&#x200B;

What am I missing?  Any other tests or things I should be asking for?  Anyone have good fertilization and blasts, but issues with embryo quality, and find something helpful?

My husband (41) 33 at that time, ½way through this and 2nd fertility doctor, found out he had a ¼ normal count and low mobility.

Background: I always felt that something wasn't normal but wasn't sure what to do or ask of the doctors from the time i first got my monthly. They weren't every month and sometimes twice a month or id skip a few months. 

A fast version of my journey: 2 years into our marriage we noticed no luck yet and started getting more concerned. The time that made me go to the doctor over my monthly was because I had a period that lasted 6weeks(huge red flag). The first specialist was at my regular hospital and was who diagnosed me. He also did my 1st surgery to correct part of my septated uterus. After the surgery I felt like just another number so seeked help for another specialist. This is when we found out my husband had problems too and I had another surgery for my septated uterus. I went through my first round of IUI (i believe that is the right abbreviation) found out I make tons of eggs but they don't mature. This doctor said they vidoed the surgery cause it was the biggest septated uterus he seen. After the surgery again I didn't feel like I was being heard and, heard some scary things from his old nurse(a coworker of mine at that time)so again on the look for a new doctor. The last doctor and my favorite by far. Said this road would be long but with work we could do it. I was put on metformin (he also said he was glad i found him that he didn't agree with some of the practices of my 2nd dr). He is the one who told me an estimate of $20k for a 40% to get pregnant. I lose over 55lbs and was still losing weight i got extremely worried about my weight (112lbs). I ended up quitting my job due to stress of all this and the way work treated me. That being said ment no insurance so I had to stop trying for the time being. Now a year and a half later of me quitting I found a new job to start the process of trying again but covid hit and im laid off and starting to wonder this huge question

Do I try to go through this process and come up with the overwhelming amount of 20k for one 40% chance of the thing my husband and I want and put ourselves in debt or step away knowing that there is still a chance event if its a tiny one?

Before this is said/asked: I have looked into adopting but its about the same price as me trying for a baby and yes id love them but knowing I can mostly carry to term is something id rather try. I want to go through everything every horrible and amazing part of pregnancy.. the morning sickness, the glow, sleepless nights, huge belly, kicks in the bladder, and giving birth. 

At times still this all is hard as if i just found it all out and I find myself breaking down crying or jealous when I see pictures of family or friends posting baby pictures.

**Background**

Me - 36f with severe endometriosis that has damaged my tubes and ovaries. Partner is 40m, no issues. We are in Canada and are paying for everything out of pocket.

**Previous Treatment**

I had a laparoscopy in summer 2018 that removed severe endo, removed 1 tube and clipped off the other, and drained cysts on my ovaries. I went on depot Lupron for 4 months while recovering and then started IVF

***IVF Cycle #1*** (34yo) – Responded decently but only got 3 eggs, 2 mature and fertilized, both stopped developing within 24hr.

***IVF Cycle #2*** (34yo) – Different stimulation protocol, only got 2 eggs, 1 mature, fertilized and developed normally. Transferred on Day 3, negative.

\*\*\*\*\*At this point our doctor felt that my ovaries were so damaged by the endo that we would continue to get a small number of eggs/ low quality eggs. We could continue to try, but as we don’t have unlimited time or money, we decided to switch to donor eggs. My sister considered donating to us but it didn’t work out, so we went to a clinic in the Czech Republic.

***IVF Cycle #3*** (35yo) – Donor eggs. Got 3 great day 5 embryos, transferred 1 fresh, resulted in a chemical pregnancy. PGS tested the 2 remaining embryos (1 normal, 1 not). Went back for a ***FET*** (36yo) of the normal embryo this time adding in Lovenox and prednisone (I was not tested for blood disorders or immune issues but I have known auto-immune disorders). Another chemical pregnancy.

**Next Steps?**

Another cycle of donor eggs, but at this point I’m wondering if the 2 back-to-back chemical pregnancies can be attributed to just back luck or if we should be worried about something else? Our only known issue is my endometriosis and my husband has occasionally had borderline sperm mobility measures, but this clinic does ICSI and fertilization has not been an issue.

Our clinic hasn’t recommended many changes for the next cycle. They want me to redo TSH and prolactin bloodwork, as well as to have another hysteroscopy (I had one 2 years ago where a small polyp was removed). They also recommended a karyotype test for my husband. They said we could pursue thrombophilia and immune testing but the treatment would be the same as the protocol used for the FET (aspirin, Lovenox, prednisone).

I’m not sure where to go from here. Should we just try again? Get another opinion? Look at a different clinic?

I lost my newborn few months ago and we've been trying to do everything we could to conceive again. Long story short. We're both 40 F/M, long history of infertility, female factor - PCOS.

I was told by RE that I'm responding well to the stims, I got above average number of eggs for my age. He changed the med on 2nd stims to see if it would improves the outcome and it did.

Jan 2020:- 1st ER, 300 Menopur + cetrotide for 12 days, 19 eggs, 13 matured, 11 fertilized, 3 to days 5 blasts, all came back abnormal - aneuploid. Period came 5 days after ER.

Aug 2020:- 2nd ER, 150 Gonal F + 150 Pregoveris + cetrotide for 11 days, 25 eggs, 25 matured, 17 fertilized, 8 to days 5 blasts, only 2 came back as mosaic. Period came a week later after ER.

We're leaning toward another ER in 2-3 weeks time frame, but haven't consult this possibilities in details with RE. I would like to know what should I discuss with RE when I go in next week.

These are my thoughts and questions:-

1- Pre-scan to find out how many possible eggs before ER, if the numbers are not ideal, we should cancel it.

2- What can I do to improve the eggs quality? I'm taking CoQ10 100mg, prenatal, DHA and metformin (for PCOS). I just increased it to 300mg today because I saw  a lot of redditors are taking 600mg. Last time I consulted my RE and he said 100mg is enough, so....\*shrugs\*

3- How long I need to wait for FET if I do another ER? Would it be ok/risky for me to do FET right after the 3rd ER PGS report comes out?

My ER told us he wouldn't have done it differently - either slow stimulations or do lower number of ER because it's a numbers game to us. He said from my history, more means better chances, but of course he is open for all discussion. At the end, he simply couldn't guarantee the result of the outcomes.

I ovulate like clockwork, always have, between 11-14. But our prior clinic suggested a medicated cycle with letrozole since we have a history of loss. She claimed this would encourage my body to ovulate more than one follicle upping our chances of success.

They did a mid cycle check had two huge follicles and promised me I would ovulate within a day or two. Except I never got a proper surge. So I called them and they assured me I ovulated (without any tests and just based on what they saw days earlier.) so I trusted them and didn’t do the trigger.

Well come period time my period was over two weeks late which leads me to believe I ovulated way later than I thought.

Fast forward to this month we didn’t use anything and are heading into IVF when my cycle starts.

I once again never got an LH surge 😔 so I got my blood tested and ultrasound on day 18 and one 22mm follicle so once again they assured me I would ovulate soon but never got a surge.

We realize the AM/PM distinction doesn't work for every timezone, just use the most recently posted one (you can sort the sub by ""new"" to find this easily).  It also helps tremendously if you upvote the daily threads when you see them so they stay at the top of the sub making them easier for others to find.

The daily Treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or treatment related questions.  It's a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help.

The daily Chat threads are for anything and everything not related to treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won't stop asking about when you're having kids? Funny story? Rant? These all go in the Chat thread. This is a great place to get to know fellow members outside of their treatment or diagnosis.   

Have a question that you think might warrant a standalone post or doesn't fit in the treatment/chat threads?  Try the FAQ/Wiki first!  https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index  We have archived posts covering getting started, what all those acronyms mean, what we wish we knew ahead of time, individual experiences with ALL the medications, treatment options, common protocols, procedures, paying for treatment, past AMA archives, hunger games data... there's a lot of information there!

It also helps tremendously if you upvote the daily threads when you see them so they stay at the top of the sub making them easier for others to find.</p>

<p>The daily Treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or treatment related questions.  It&#39;s a great place to get to know other folks in the trenches, find cycle buddies, or learn from others that may be further along in the cycle or treatment than you.  These threads are your best place to get treatment related help.</p>

<p>The daily Chat threads are for anything and everything not related to treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won&#39;t stop asking about when you&#39;re having kids? Funny story? Rant? These all go in the Chat thread. This is a great place to get to know fellow members outside of their treatment or diagnosis.   </p>

My husband (26) and I (27) have been trying to get pregnant since I misscarried in December, and then I was diagnosed with PCOS. I feel so absolutely alone and all anyone keeps telling me is to relax and stop trying so hard. I just feel like I really need a friend that knows what I'm going through. 

I've also had a terrible experience with my doctors office they wrote down when they found that I misscarried that I probably had PCOS and they never told me. When my first cycle was 116 days long I called multiple times and they told me to wait it out. My second cycle was 96 days and thats when the OB told me she thought I might have PCOS and to talk to infertility. All that doctor did was look at my results from the miscarriage and say, yeah it looks like you have PCOS and that was 6 months after they had done the ultrasound. I've come to terms with how shitty they have been and we plan on changing insurance when we can. Now we're waiting for my period to come again so I can get an HSG done and hopefully get some help with ovulation and my cycle. 

On top of all of this my husband and I are supposed to have a wedding (we got married at the court house) in Ireland (we live in the states) Oct 2021, so we had agreed to stop trying for 7 months and as that time gets closer I'm getting more and more anxious, and starting to feel super depressed about having to stop.

We attempted in June to start with a low stim protocol after estrogen and ganirelix priming (I was having frequent early recruiting). I was on femara for first 5 days, with 150 follistim starting on day 4. I went in on day 7 and had a lead follicle on the right, and a few smaller on the left, so we cancelled. 

RE decided to change the protocol for round 2, and we did again estrogen prime with ganirelix. Baseline had 8 small follicles. They had me start mircodose Lupron on day 2. 150 menopur and 300 Follistim added in beginning day 4 while continuing MDL 20 units both am/pm. I was also taking saizen every other night. 

By day 5 stims I had again a lead follicle (15mm), so they decided to let it go post mature and try to get the cohort of smaller follicles. I had checks on days 8, 10, and day 11 which was the day of trigger. On that day I had R: 26, 17, 12.5 and L: 9.5, 11.5, 16, 16. They had me inject my evening meds of mdl and follistim several hours before the trigger. 

4 follicles were retrieved and 2 were post mature, 2 immature. Nothing to fertilize. I’m
Completely devastated and need some ideas on what to bring to the table. 

I’ve read both bad and good things about microdose lupron, but also wonder if it was too much Lh with the menopur? I also tested as extremely low Testosterone (like below lab range for total Free T) and wonder if this is part of the problem, as I understand it’s needed for proper follicular development, but my RE didn’t believe in priming with it.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

As a background, my husband is 42 and I’m 37. We did whatever the testing that was required by our clinic, which revealed no obvious issues and left us with an unexplained diagnosis. My AMH was 7.32 in February and my husband’s numbers were 225 million (86 million of active sperm or whatever its called) with 32% motility and 6% morphology in April. 
I started an antagonist protocol in early August (225 Gonal-F and 150 Menopur). Within 48 hours, my meds were adjusted to 150 Gonal-F and 150 Menopur. I was told to trigger on day 9 of stims even though the attending on that day told me that my left ovary was a day behind (my right ovary had follicles anywhere between 16 to 20 millimeters, but my right one was under 16). I was not told to adjust any of the mediation, just to do a dual trigger (Lupron 40 units on the night of trigger and then another 40 units the next morning and Ovidrel - 1/4 of the syringe). My E2 was 4,500 on the day of the trigger. 

They retrieved 22 follicles yesterday. Today, I received a phone call that more than half of those eggs were immature. One egg fertilized normally. Five eggs are being watched to see if they would fertilize with ICSI. I knew that we would experience a steep attrition rate, but this feels like we were mismanaged. I reviewed the hunger games spreadsheet and can’t even find anyone who had experienced anything similar. 

Full disclosure, we are at NYU Fertility Clinic and their stats are supposed to be amazing. 

So here are my questions:
1. Does it make sense to try a long protocol? We would get fewer eggs, but perhaps better quality. 
2. Would it be better to stim with even less meds so that my ovaries could get in sync. Perhaps 75/75?
3. Could i have cruised for a day without meds to let the eggs mature more before the trigger?
4. Would it have made more sense to do a different trigger even though my estrogen was high?

Since we live in Norway seeking health care in public sector is very common here despite the long waiting time. I was referred to this gynaecologist through my family doctor after one year of attempts with  no success. The second year I was prescribed Femara to stimulate ovulation. I got pregnant after one year and 3 months but ended up with miscarriage after two weeks. Two more miscarriage in two years. By the way when I started Femara I got very strong symptoms of PMS.  And during three years of TTC I was always sick and tired because of PMS. This gynaecologist didn't want to do more tests or to figure out what was wrong with me. She kept saying  you need to try more and more and more.  Even I explained was tired and I got so much painful cramps, she didn't show any empathy.  we asked for more tests and  IVF trial she rejected our requests. The last cycle, I had too much pain and I couldn't leave the bed for 5 days. That was the last straw in the back. I urged my husband to get private medical treatment coz I couldn't wait any longer. Which we did. The private endocrinologist is very professional and has long experience  with infertility and IVF. He suspects I could have mild to moderate endometriosis and that was the main reason of recurrent miscarriages and struggle to conceive again. Now He prescribed OVITRELLE injection before one day of ovulation and CRINONE ( progesterone) for 15 days after ovulation. He said that in case of endometriosis, getting pregnant is the best treatment because it can go away after one or more pregnancy and he advised to try to get pregnant this year. If  the pain don't go away he will ask for  clinical test with laparoscopy and seek treatment but it can take long time

PS : In Norway  it takes one to two year to change the gyneacologist so it is very common to be supervised by one gynaecologist in public health. And another reason we didn't change is because my husband trusted her blindly and never questioned her competence ( it is a norwegian thing). Thirdly, to get to endocrinologist in public hospital you need to be referred by the gyneacologist. Yet my first gyneacologist refused to do it

Also after asking many questions and reading reddit posts here, I realized that I had to change  the gynaecologist and seek more help with IVF. I am very grateful for this subreddit.

I feel a bit upset and angry coz I feel I was duped by my first gyneacologist and all the time wasted because of her lack of expertise and incompetence.

I have 1 child who just turned 16. I had her very young, in my first marriage which ended very poorly. When I got remarried years ago, I thought we would just carry on and expand the family. 

But that never happened. 

I've watched my ex go on to have 3 more kids he didn't even want and my current husband and I tried for years. I thought it was him, bc of aforementioned reasons, but it turns out it was me. After an HSG and then nearly a year of monitored, monthly ultrasounds, my left tube was blocked from scar tissue due to unknown reasons and I never ovulated from my right ovary. Every month it was my left and every month it was just... useless. 

Our reproductive endocrinologist said the best course was IVF. But the cost just seemed too immense to us. So we agreed not to pursue it. 

It's always weighed on me. I regret it now. I know that it might not even work now, or stick bc I'd be considered a geriatric pregnancy and I do have a few other health issues. But it's been 5 years since we gave up and every year I get more depressed and regret it more. 

I don't know how to approach it with him though. I think he has long given up, but honestly we don't talk about it much, and we've sort of self isolated ourselves from all our friends that are having kids.

I feel so alone. I feel like nobody in my life can relate to all the things I have gone through and continue to go through. I am hoping someone with similar experience will read this and if nothing else, feel a little less alone in this crazy world we all are living in right now.

My husband and I got married in 2017 and started trying for a baby in July of 2018. We only waited because we really wanted to be in a good place financially before adding to our family (recovering from a wedding is a lot!). At the time we were both 33 and full of optimism. Nothing happened right away but I still felt like a baby was a tangible thing we could create together. After a year I started seeing an OBGYN about possible fertility issues and to be honest, I just felt like a number or statistic. I realize they see thousands of women like me, but I didn't get much empathy and that feeling of being alone started there.

After getting nowhere with an OBGYN, I got a referral and started seeing a Doctor at a fertility clinic. On paper, he was literally the best doctor you could find in my area and that kept some hope alive in me that we could have a baby of our own. I was 34 when I started IVF, and I remember in my first appointment him telling me ""you're young, healthy and we are going to give you a baby in 2020"". I literally clung to those words. We started the IVF process and got 5 eggs on our first retrieval. Of those 5 only 4 fertilized and three made it to the final stage and were viable for transfer. I went through two transfers and neither took. When your trying to get pregnant and have a negative pregnancy test its pretty discouraging, but when you go through everything we go through with IVF and get a negative test its downright devastating. All our hope went to our last remaining embryo, and then COVID hit.

My husband and I both lost our jobs. We both worked in the event industry in the Boston area, so needless to say we don't have jobs to go back to. I could turn this thread into an employment rant, but that's not why I'm writing. Having lost our income and insurance we have put IVF on hold for now. I have no idea when we will be able to start again but I cry about it everyday. We have a lot of savings, but that was supposed to be our down payment on a house. And even if we spent our savings on another round, how do we keep up with healthcare if we are finally blessed with a positive result?

Nobody in my life has been through what we are going through. Though I have many supportive friends that I love and value, its really hard for them to give support beyond ""It will happen when the time is right"". I'm 35, when is the time right? And its so easy for you to say that when you're already a mother and in most cases are expecting your 2nd. EVERYBODY I know is pregnant, even a couple friends of mine who ""never wanted kids"" and now all they do is talk about their pregnancy and future plans as a family. I don't live around any of my family and I feel like the distance almost makes them blind to all I am going through. My sister has two kids and because it took her a year to conceive she thinks she can relate to my struggle. HARD EYE ROLL.

I feel so alone. I cry everyday. My husband tries to support me but if he really knew how hard I am on myself about it he would be devastated. Plus, he also needs support, I am not the only one going through this, but I don't know how to give that support to him when I am as fragile as an eggshell.

basically all what the title says. I will have an IUI in a few days and an IVF next month, but I definitely have to get familiar with the thought of having donor eggs.

Hope everyone is hanging in and doing well. I am wondering is anyone can shed some light on these symptoms I've been having ...

I had my egg retrieval on July 25, with a Lupron trigger for a freeze all cycle. Results were good but there was fear of OHSS as I produced quite a few eggs. Was out on Dostinex. Had a couple phone check ins with the clinic and was cleared, got my period 6 days after retrieval.

Google warned me that my period might be tougher than usual but it wasn't... It was normal... Actually there was LESS cramping than usual, which I found a bit odd, but whatever.

Now, 2.5.weeks after the retrieval, I feel bloated and a bit crampy like my period is about to start. Major PMS also - I am VERY irritable and that's not like me at all. I've been experiencing hot flashes on and off too, and just a general unwellness. It's very strange. (no fever though, so not covid)

I tried googling my symptoms but I haven't found much (that falls into this category anyways). Has ANYone experienced anything like this? I thought I'd reach out before contacting the clinic, as I haven't really had the best experience with them and I'm trying to keep my interactions with them to a minimum. 

As a side note, Technically this is when my natural cycle would have kicked in... my last Day 1 (before stims and retrieval) was June 16th, and my cycles are about 30 days (PMS symptoms usually start a few days before). Could that have something to do with it?

Anyways, if anyone could shed some light on this that would be really awesome. Otherwise, i'll just bite the bullet and call my clinic ...

We retrieved 13 eggs.  9 were mature.  6 were fertilized. 
I got a call from the doctor on Day 4 giving me a heads up that we might not be able to do a Day 5 transfer because all the eggs are slow to develop. 

1 embryo had  arrested development on Day 2 and was discarded The remaining 5 embryos were slow to develop, i.e. a Day 4 embryo looks like a Day 3. 

Today (Day 5) I went in to see the doctor and she gave me the bad news that we have no eggs to transfer or freeze.  Of the 5 embryos that were remaining, 4 has arrested development, and the remaining one is graded poorly (I think she said a Grade 4) and they do not recommend transferring it. 

As you would imagine, I am devastated.  I asked the doctor what the issue might have been, and she mentioned that all 9 of the mature eggs had ""granularity"". 

On paper, everything else looked okay.  I'm 36, AMH is 3.37, and had an okay ovarian reserve.  There sperm sample my husband gave was ~2m, with 100% motility and 100% progressive. So it seemed like granularity was the problem.

I could not find much info on ""granularity"" online and was wondering if anyone knows anything about this.  The doctor basically explained it as the eggs having a grainy look to them. 

The doctor made it sound like it's pretty bad when 9 out of 9 eggs have granularity. It suggests that there is something wrong with most of my eggs.  She said when she sees a problem like this, the chance of getting pregnant on the next IVF is small.  I asked her ""What's small, less than 10% chance?"" and she said yes. 

I am now at home trying to do more research about granularity and am not finding much and would appreciate it if anyone has any information to share. Sounds like this will be the beginning of a very long and difficult journey for me, and I am thankful there is a wealth of information on this forum.

202,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all! I was wondering if anyone has experience with diagnosing/treating MFI when you have Kaiser Insurance (specifically southern California) without infertility coverage. My husband and I are actually on different plans. I have a PPO that covers diagnostics but not services, and my husband has Kaiser HMO.

We had 28 mature eggs, 17 fertilize and only 4 blasts; only 1 blast was considered ""good"" as far as grading. ICSI was used. I've had 2 of those embryos stick and both ended in a miscarriage. Initial semen analysis showed 4.4 million count and only 2% motility and 1% morph. Varicocele was ruled out, he does have low T and high FSH. After 7 months of clomid count was 16.5 million and 32% motile sperm and 0% morph. 3 months later (continued clomid) we did our 1st retrieval with above results. We stopped clomid after retrieval and he has not restarted because the side effects were awful and we didn't foresee having to do another retrieval. He has been taking Conception XR, ubliquinol, omega 3 fatty acid, vitamin C, vitamin D and maca root since middle of June. Given that he hasn't been on the clomid, there is a moderate chance that his analysis is back to the baseline. His sperm hasn't been tested for DNA frag, but I suspect it due to high embryo arrest and miscarriages. 

I was reading on ZyMot's website that ""The ZyMōt ICSI Sperm Separation Device uses very small sample volumes. The ZyMōt ICSI device should only be used with normospermic patients pursuing ICSI, not patients with low count or motility."" Does that mean that we should ensure they use the ZyMōt Multi 850µL?

Would PICSI or TESE be recommended instead? We are willing to do whatever it takes to get a better outcome this time around because it is the last retrieval we can afford. I feel like our fertility clinic won't give us a straight answer. They just feel like plain ICSI is the best thing since sliced bread.

208,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone, as I head into my second cycle of letrozole + TI, I figured it might be time to graduate to this sub from TFAB. My husband (34) and I (36) have been actively trying for a year and have just started the medical part of this journey, but I’m finding everything a little overwhelming. I wanted to introduce myself, and also ask a question. I apologize if this is long!

We had a full workup done in June and our working diagnosis is “unexplained.” My husband’s SA results came back normal - count is great, motility is good, DNA fragmentation is low, morphology is normal but a bit low (8%) but our doctor didn’t think that was an issue since his count is so high. I had a full blood panel, a saline sonohysterogram, and pelvic/transvaginal ultrasounds. Everything looks normal for me, too, with the exception of my AMH (more on that below). My RE said it was probably just due to my age that we hadn’t conceived yet.

He didn’t think we needed to jump straight into IVF, since we only want one child. So I’ve started letrozole with follicle monitoring and timed intercourse. We’re not using a trigger shot, just LH tests to track ovulation at home. I started on 5 mg and only grew one follicle (and didn’t get pregnant obviously, today is CD1, lol). My doc wants to try me on 7.5 mg and see if I can grow more than one. We’ll do that for two more cycles before adding in IUI, trying that for three cycles, then moving to IVF.

So as I said, I know this is early in the process, but I’ve been thinking and reading a lot about silent endometriosis. I don’t have major issues with menstrual pain or pelvic pain in general. I was on birth control more or less continually from age 18-34 and had no cramps or PMS while on it. Off birth control, I have cramps on day 1 but I never considered them debilitating. I just take a tylenol and go on with my day. Bleeding lasts 4-5 days, the first day is heavy but I never thought it was abnormal. Very occasionally I have mid-cycle spotting.

I’ve read that endometriosis can present asymptomatically, though, so a few things have gotten me wondering.

* My AMH is 10 pmol/ng. My RE isn’t panicking about it, but it is lower than average. I have read that endometriosis can have an effect on both egg quantity and quality, and women with endo tend to have lower AMH. My AFC was 13 and my FSH was 6.2 on CD5, which seems pretty average?
* I’ve never had a UTI but lately, I’ve noticed that my bladder frequently feels irritated, like I have to urinate but my bladder isn’t actually full. 
* My sono results indicated no evidence of fibroids or polyps and my tubes were open. However, there was a note that I had an “inhomogeneous myometrium.” I asked about it and the fertility nurse said it was “nothing to be concerned about” and my uterus looked normal. However, I’ve read that this can indicate endometrial infiltration into the myometrium, i.e. adenomyosis, which is associated with endo.
* My sister has a history of (severely painful) endo and ovarian cysts, as well as secondary infertility.
* I don’t know if this is relevant, but I had abdominal migraines when I was a teenager, which I eventually grew out of.

I’ve never had even a hint of a positive HPT in 12 cycles of perfectly timed sex and normal ovulation. I know we’re early in the process, but I want to make sure we leave no stone unturned, because we can only afford one round of IVF if it comes to that (maybe two, if our families help). Our insurance excludes all fertility treatment, our drug coverage is minimal, and although we live in a province with publicly-funded IVF, the wait list is approx. 2 years - time we can’t afford to waste. I’m wondering when it would be appropriate to bring up the possibility of testing for endometriosis with my doctor? I know opinions are mixed on whether surgery for endo can improve or decrease IVF success rates, but I don’t want to waste our one shot at IVF. Also, if surgery could address my infertility without the need for IVF, that would be way more cost-effective for us in the long run. Is this something I should raise now, or wait to see how I respond to other treatments? Am I being a complete hypochondriac? (It’s ok to say so if I am, lol, I won’t be offended!)

Because of COVID it will be a phone consultation. If you can give me any guidance on what testing/treatments to advocate for I’d really appreciate it. Here is my story: 

- I am 28(F) and husband is 31(M) 
- We had a miscarriage in 2017 @5 weeks and then waited to TTC again until after we got married (IUD placed)
- I had a LEEP in 2017 
- We started actively trying in Jan 2019 (IUD removed). I charted, temped, used OPKs, timed intercourse, the whole thing. My cycles are regular 26-28 days and I ovulate normally. 
- June 2019 my husband had his sperm checked which came back as okay. 
- Nov 2019 we finally conceived after 11 failed cycles. However, in Jan 2020 it was found to be a missed miscarriage. I had a D and C at 10weeks. I stopped tracking my cycles at this point besides logging period days. 
- April 2020 I had a miscarriage at 5weeks. 
- My husband and I had bloodwork done to check for genetic diseases, which came back as normal. I had an RPL done which came back as a “weak positive” for anti-phospholipid syndrome. I was re-tested and it was a “weak positive” again. I was sent to a hematologist who said I don’t meet the criteria for diagnosis and suggested I take a daily dose of aspirin. I had bloodwork for things like STDs, thyroid, etc and everything is normal. 
- I had an ultrasound done in July that noted “endometrial cysts” (it gave no # or size so my doctor took this to mean it was insignificant data), and they found a hemorrhagic cyst on my right ovary. However, it turns out I was 4 weeks pregnant at this ultrasound - with an ectopic pregnancy so unsure of those findings? (They did not see the pregnancy on the ultrasound, I had beta HCGs the same week that confirmed it). I was placed on progesterone for the pregnancy. 
- Last week, at 8 weeks along I went to the hospital after experiencing pain (no bleeding) and it was discovered I was having the ectopic pregnancy. It ruptured and I lost my right tube. This marked my 4th loss. 
- This morning the fertility clinic called to set up my first consultation. At this point I am terrified to keep trying, and feel lost. What questions should I be asking them? What testing should I have? Would moving to IUI’s be better for us? What is our outcome now that I only have one tube?

#THE VERY BASICS: What is PGS / PGT-A? Useful definitions.
**PGS** stands for “preimplantation genetic screening”: screening one or more embryos for certain genetic content, in order to help decide *whether* to attempt to transfer the screened embryo into an uterus, and if so *in what order* (e.g., to rank the order in which embryos will be used to attempt transfer, if at all). In broad terms, such testing is generally done by taking a biopsy of several cells from the trophectoderm of a developing embryo (aka trophoblast, the part that may eventually develop into a placenta https://www.britannica.com/science/blastocyst  ), and running various tests on those biopsied cells. What types of tests are run depends upon what type of pre-implantation genetic screening is being conducted.

 
__PGT-A__ (“preimplantation genetic testing – aneuploidy”, sometimes also referred to as  **CCS**, comprehensive chromosome screening) is a particular type of PGS, which screens embryos for numerical chromosomal aneuploidy to determine whether the embryo has the proper number of chromosomes. (https://ormgenomics.com/2018/09/20/pgt-what-does-it-all-mean/ ) There are also other types of preimplantation genetic screening, which screen for other types of genetic anomalies (**PGT-SR**, which screens for structural rearrangements, e.g., translocations, within a particular chromosome; **PGD** [preimplantation diagnosis] / **PGT-M**, which screens for single-gene / inheritable diseases and syndromes).  *Ibid.*  **Most commonly, when people refer to “PGS” generically, they are usually referring to screening for numerical chromosomal aneuploidy, i.e., PGT-A, even though the term actually has a broader meaning.** Likewise, older literature sometimes uses the terms “PGS” and “PGD” interchangeably, whereas more recent literature is more careful to use the more specific meanings.

#WHAT PROBLEMS IS PGT-A SCREENING TRYING TO SOLVE? WHAT OUTCOMES IS PGT-A TRYING TO IMPROVE?
Genetic aneuploidy in an embryo, and in particular non-inherited *numerical chromosomal aneuploidy* in embryos (having the wrong number of chromosomes) is by far the primary cause of post-conception pregnancy loss (in particular chemical pregnancies and miscarriages at other stages), accounting for roughly 40-65% of all pregnancy losses/miscarriages: this is true for both spontaneously conceived pregnancies, and for ART pregnancies such as IUI and IVF/ICSI pregnancies. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4729087/ ; https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2018/11/early-pregnancy-loss ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4736891/#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20chromosomal%20abnormalities%20are,to%20test%20aneuploidy%20in%20miscarriage. ; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-009-9292-z.  Certain types of chromosomal aneuploidies can cause either pregnancy loss (or implantation failure), or in other instances can cause congenital health problems in a resulting child.  E.g., trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome); trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome); trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome); Turner Syndrome (whole or partial monosomy X); Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), etc.

 
So, the idea is that avoiding the transfer of embryos with demonstrated genetic aneuploidy would logically (1) reduce the rate of post-transfer pregnancy loss and the rate of congenital birth defects; and conversely (2) increase the rate of successful live birth in general, and increase the rate of successful live birth without congenital defects in particular. Presumably, this increase in success rates *on a per-transfer basis* would also (3) reduce the time it takes (and the number of transfers it takes) to achieve a live birth. *One or all of these three goals are generally what PGT-A is used to try to achieve.*
 

###*But, how to know whether the embryos you have available are chromosomally aneuploid or not?*
 
The morphology of a blastocyst-stage embryo – what its shape looks like visually (aka its “grade”) - is very subjective, and isn’t a great predictor of whether an embryo is/isn’t chromosomally competent to potentially result in a live birth of a genetically normal baby.  Although “better” graded embryos more frequently tend to be **euploid** (having the correct set of 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes plus one pair of sex chromosomes for a total of 23 pairs/46 total chromosomes) than “poorer” graded embryos, this isn’t always true; and attempting to detect aneuploidy/euploidy based on morphology/grading has a high rate of error (in the range of approximately 30%-60% equivalent error rate). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405648/ ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6133810/ ; https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/29/6/1173/624854 [“A moderate relation between blastocyst morphology and CCS data was observed but *the ability to implant seems to be mainly determined by the chromosomal complement of preimplantation embryos rather than developmental and morphological parameters* conventionally used for blastocyst evaluation” (emphasis added)] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5982556/.)    
 
As discussed below, **in comparison to embryo morphology/grading, PGT-A is a better predictor of whether an embryo is/isn’t chromosomally competent to potentially result in a live birth of a genetically normal baby**.  And, although it isn’t 100% accurate, PGT-A it is the best predictor presently available.
 
##RELEVANT HISTORY OF PGS/PGT-A SCREENING, and A NOTE ABOUT PRE-2016 LITERATURE/RESEARCH.
PGS/PGT-A screening is a very new and rapidly developing tool. Prior to about 2013-2016, physicians, embryologists, and researchers used different techniques for PGS/PGT-A than they do today. The medical field went from not testing for chromosomal aneuploidy at all, to testing for only a few chromosomes within the biopsy, to — starting in about 2013-2016 — testing for all 23 sets of chromosomes; went from using slower embryo freezing technologies to using the almost-immediate vitrification freezing approach, which now has higher rates of successful thawing and has minimized the small likelihood of damage to the embryo in that process; went from reporting only “normal” vs “abnormal” determinations regarding each tested embryo, to reporting the more specific “normal”, “abnormal”, “mosaic”, and “no result” (further discussion of these reported result types below); improved biopsy and Petri dish culturing methods; and so on. The end result (so far) of these improvements has been increased accuracy of testing; reduced likelihood of embryo damage/embryo loss from the PGT-A biopsy/freezing/screening process; and, when PGT-A screened “normal” embryos are transferred, increased implantation rates and reduced pregnancy loss rates (and corollary increased live birth rates on a per-transfer basis). (https://ivf-worldwide.com/cogen/oep/pgd-pgs/history-of-pgd-and-pgs.html ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6333033/ ; https://www.ivf-hub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Scott-Typeset-for-publishing-v4-28SEP2019.pdf ).
 
Since these technologies and techniques were only developed and came into broader use between roughly 2013-2016 and the present, the related scientific research discussing these newer techniques only began to be published in approximately 2013-2016, at the earliest. So, it is important to note that *research papers discussing PGS/PGT-A which were published prior to about 2016, or which were published later but examine research conducted prior to about 2016, often (but not always) pertain to techniques which are no longer in widespread use today*, and as a result the findings of such research papers may not be applicable to the PGS/PGT-A screening being offered by REs today.
 
#How does it work?  What do the lab folks do in PGT-A?
For PGT-A, an embryologist takes a biopsy of cells from the **trophectoderm** (outer rim of cells that may develop into a placenta) of a 5-7 day embryo (**blastocyst**), and then sends them to a separate lab for analysis.  That separate lab amplifies the genetic data within the biopsied cells/cell lines, and runs various tests to determine whether the cell lines/genetic data derived from those biopsied cells have the correct number of each chromosome (**euploid** cells having 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes plus one pair of sex chromosomes for a total of 23 pairs/46 total chromosomes); or an incorrect number of one or more of the sets of chromosomes (**aneuploid**); or some cell lines with the correct number of chromosomes and some cell lines with an incorrect number of chromosomes (a **mosaic** biopsy). 
 
#Understanding your PGT-A lab report.
After running the screening process, the lab reports the findings of these trophectoderm biopsies as follows: Normal, abnormal, mosaicism, or “no result”. There are some methodological nuances that differ based on the specific type of PGT-A test done and may differ from lab to lab, but generally speaking, for a particular embryo, if all of the cell lines/amplified DNA content derived from that embryo’s biopsy are euploid the embryo is reported as “**normal**”; if all of the cell lines/amplified DNA content derived from that embryo’s biopsy are aneuploid the embryo is reported as “**abnormal**”; and if some of the cell lines/amplified DNA derived from that embryo’s biopsy are euploid and some are aneuploid, then the embryo is reported as “**mosaic**”.  (Further explanation of mosaicism here: https://www.coopergenomics.com/blog/during-ivf/mosaicism-what-we-know-what-we-dont-know/) *Note, however, that some labs still report embryos with mosaic biopsies as “abnormal” – if you are considering PGT-A testing, you should ask your RE whether the lab they use reports mosaics.*  Based on these reported results, “normal” embryos would be preferred for transfer because they have the highest likelihood of success, mosaic embryos might be considered for transfer but are not preferred (further discussion below), and “abnormal” embryos are generally discarded (donated to science or whatever you contracted with your RE to do with them when you signed the PGS/PGT-A paperwork). 
 
##Concordance / Discordance between the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass.
When designating an embryo “normal” or “abnormal” or “mosaic” based on the trophectoderm biopsy, PGT-A screening assumes that the cells in the trophectoderm of the embryo (which can develop into a placenta if all goes well) match the cells in the inner cell mass of the embryo (which can develop into a fetus if all goes well). In other words, assumes that there is “concordance” between the cells in these two parts of the embryo.  It appears that there is usually – but not always – concordance between the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass: concordance rates seem to be somewhere between 86% - 97%. (https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/24/12/593/5145914 ; https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/26/4/269/5721558 ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6262631/ ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1472648319301579 ; https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31359-6/pdf .)  Thus, *although the PGT-A process is pretty reliable, it is not 100% accurate* (and, no one worth their salt claims it is – even the PGS labs acknowledge this [e.g., Progenesis reports approximately 98% accuracy rate/2% error rate, https://www.progenesis.com/overview-of-pgd-technology/ ]; Igenomix, same rates, https://www.igenomix.com/genetic-solutions/pgt-a-preimplantation-genetic-testing-aneuploidies/ ;  Cooper Genomics, same rates https://www.coopergenomics.com/blog/during-ivf/mosaicism-what-we-know-what-we-dont-know/]).
 
**Note:** The research behind trophectoderm/inner cell mass concordance (matching) or discordance (not matching) is still developing and is a very new (and therefore contentious) area of research.  Some reasons that have been proposed to explain incidents of discordance between the euploid/aneuploid status of an embryo’s trophectoderm/inner cell mass include:  errors introduced in the laboratory processes (e.g., accidental contamination during biopsy, cell growth, etc.); embryos “repairing” themselves during development by “pushing” aneuploid cells out of the inner cell mass and into the trophectoderm, thereby tending to result in a euploid inner cell mass but reflecting trophectoderm cells which read as aneuploid or mosaic when biopsied; mosaicism in trophectoderm cells being more common and less problematic than previously thought, therefore resulting in a more common baseline range of discordance between the inner cell mass and trophectoderm of embryos in general.  This is still an emerging area of research.
 
##What if your PGT-A lab result is “No result”?
If for some reason the lab was not able to determine the chromosomal status of the cells biopsied from a particular embryo, that is reported as “**no result**” or “no DNA” or “no diagnosis” or similar phrasing. This could happen for any number of reasons, including but not limited to: too few cells obtained in the biopsy, contamination or damage to the biopsy in the lab or in transit, the biopsied cells failed to grow, sufficient DNA to run the tests couldn’t be extracted from the biopsied cells, etc.  If this happens, you may have the option of thawing that embryo, having it re-biopsied (and then re-frozen) and screened again. As you might expect, this second biopsy process increases the risk of damage to the embryo, although the vast majority survive the process and are able to re-thaw for later transfer if necessary. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24794643/ ; https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(16)61897-6/pdf ; https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31343-2/fulltext ) And, if a PGT-A screened “normal” twice-biopsied embryo is transferred, there does not seem to be a significant reduction in the chance of live birth versus a “normal” embryo that was only biopsied once. (https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(18)30156-0/fulltext).  However, as you might imagine, the body of research on this topic is very small, so especially in this area your mileage may vary. 

#IS PGT-A RIGHT FOR YOU? THINGS TO CONSIDER and DISCUSS WITH YOUR RE WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO PURSUE PGS/PGT-A SCREENING.
###Philosophical / religious considerations.
PGT-A screening does involve taking cells from each embryo for biopsy; and, although with current techniques the rates of embryo damage/loss have been reduced and are low, they are not zero. And, embryos whose biopsies are reported as “abnormal” will virtually always be discarded. If any of that doesn’t jive with your personal beliefs or preferences, then PGT-A screening is probably not for you.
 
###Will you have the opportunity to do a frozen embryo transfer (“FET”)?
Logistically, because of how long it takes to conduct the laboratory processes and report the results, PGT-A screening cannot be conducted on an embryo that will be used for a fresh transfer (although if additional blastocysts are available you still may be able to do PGT-A on any other blastocysts that result from that egg retrieval cycle).  This might happen if you are participating in a shared risk program that requires a fresh transfer; or if there are cleavage-stage embryos available but they don’t look likely to survive/develop to blastocyst stage so would need to be transferred ASAP in order to have a chance; etc. 
 
###Timing concerns, and Whether you are trying to bank embryos.
Some insurance coverages require you to attempt transfer of all available embryos before the insurance will cover another egg retrieval cycle.  If so, using PGT-A to pare down the number of embryos available for potential transfer (by designating any “abnormal” and/or “mosaic” embryos as unavailable for transfer) may help reduce the number of transfers you will have to attempt (and therefore the time those take) before you would become eligible for another covered egg retrieval. 
 
Likewise, the initial FET process itself, and the resolution of any subsequent pregnancy loss from an unsuccessful transfer, both can take significant time – weeks or months depending upon your particular circumstances. So, if you improve your per-transfer success rate, you may be able to reach the end goal of a live birth with fewer FET attempts (and therefore sooner) than if you had attempted to transfer each un-screened embryo consecutively. 
 
###Would you want to have the option to transfer a mosaic embryo? Will your RE transfer a mosaic embryo?
Virtually all REs will refuse to transfer an embryo whose PGT-A biopsy has been reported as “abnormal”. So, if you think you might want to have the option of transferring a mosaic embryo (e.g., if no remaining “normal” embryos are available), it is important to find out ahead of time (1) whether the lab that will screen your embryo biopsies reports mosaic results as “abnormal” or as “mosaic”, and (2) what is your RE’s policy regarding the possibility of transferring mosaic embryos. 
 
For REs who will consider transferring mosaic embryos, a common approach is to rank embryos for transfer as follows: first, “normal” embryos that also have “good” morphology/grading (if any); second, “normal” embryos that have lesser morphology/grading (if any); then mosaic embryos last (if any). Further, there may be particular types of aneuploidy demonstrated in a mosaic embryo regarding which you (or your RE) may not be comfortable transferring. When deciding whether to transfer a mosaic embryo, you may find it helpful to consult with a genetic counselor: most labs which run PGT-A testing also provide phone access to genetic counselors.   
 
###How many blastocysts are in play?
If there are no blastocysts available for biopsy, PGT-A screening is obviously not an option.  Similarly, if your egg retrieval results in only a few blastocysts (one, two, three, etc.), it may be more time efficient and financially efficient to proceed with transferring one or more of those embryos without PGT-A screening; and the impact of risking potential damage to those few embryos or the impact of risking potential erroneous screening (potentially resulting in no blastocysts to transfer) may be relatively more important.  **Note**: This is often why critics of PGT-A correctly point out that, while PGT-A may increase the rate of success on a *per-transfer* basis, for patients who are less likely to yield any or many blastocysts in a particular egg retrieval cycle (e.g., due to POF, DOR, ovary loss, reduced response to stims, sperm quality issues, or any other reason), PGT-A isn’t particularly helpful and may not increase the likelihood of success on a *per-cycle* basis.
 

Conversely, if your egg retrieval cycle results in many embryos, it may be more time efficient, financially efficient, and potentially more emotionally tolerable to proceed with PGT-A screening to pare down the number of blastocysts to only those that are reported as “normal” or “mosaic”, so as to avoid spending time, money, and emotional energy trying to transfer embryos with no or very low likelihood of success (e.g., by weeding out known “abnormals”) trying to find the proverbial “normal” needle in the haystack.

 
What the magic number is for you will of course depend on your own personal circumstances and appetite for risk – e.g., Will you proceed with PGT-A no matter how many blastocysts you get? Only if you get 3 or more? Only if you get 8 or more? Something else?
 
###How much will PGT-A cost in general? And, is that cost more or less than the cost of a frozen embryo transfer (“FET”)?
PGT-A screening isn’t cheap, and is not affordable for everyone.  *Just like PGT-A isn’t a guarantee of success, if you can’t afford PGT-A or otherwise decide not to pursue it, that’s not a guarantee of failure either.*
 
Depending upon the lab and your RE clinic, PGT-A screening is sometimes paid for on a per-embryo basis, and sometimes paid for as a flat rate for screening several embryos at once (e.g., often a flat rate for screening up to 8 embryos).  So, this is another layer of decision-making to consider when determining what your “magic number” might be.
 
If you end up with many blastocysts, it may be overall less expensive to pay to proceed with PGT-A screening so as to reduce the number of blastocysts you would consider transferring, and concurrently increasing your chances of success on a per-transfer basis; than it would be to pay for multiple consecutive FETs trying to transfer each embryo one at a time (or even two at a time).  Of course, the math of these finances will depend upon the costs of FETs at your clinic, the costs of FET medications, what you may have to pay for PGT-A, and how many blastocysts you have available/want to test.
 
###Does PGT-A screening require the use of ICSI, or can it be done with plain-vanilla IVF?
PGT-A screening does not inherently require the use of more-expensive ICSI; the PGT-A biopsying can also be done in an IVF cycle.  However, it is common for RE clinics to require ICSI when opting for PGT-A.  While ICSI may not be necessary in general, it may be that your RE/embryologist feels more comfortable doing PGT-A biopsy when they’ve had control over the entire embryo-creation process from the start (i.e., including selection of the sperm with which to fertilize the egg via ICSI); they may feel they get better results/less embryo loss/damage when they do biopsy after ICSI versus after IVF;… or they straight up may be trying to squeeze you for extra money (because ICSI costs more than IVF).  If you are concerned about this, talk to your clinic about whether (and why) they do/don’t require ICSI with PGT-A.
 
###Is using PGT-A screening likely to improve YOUR chances of success? The impacts of egg age.
As noted above, chromosomal aneuploidy is the primary cause of pregnancy loss.  The rates of incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy (and pregnancy loss due to aneuploidy) increase dramatically with age; and this is true for both spontaneous pregnancies, and ART pregnancies. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC27416/ ; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075953. The likelihood of a particular embryo being aneuploid depends a lot on the **age of the eggs being used** (the age of the woman from whom the eggs were retrieved, whether a donor or autologous cycle). **This article sets out the expected range of percentage of “normal” vs. “abnormal” embryos based on maternal/egg age**, and also has a very useful discussion of the likelihood of obtaining any blastocysts to test in the first place based on maternal/egg age: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216000662 (if you want the cliff-notes version, scroll down to the colorful graphs).

 
So, although reducing the rate of incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy would be helpful for reducing the likelihood of pregnancy loss in women of any age, generally  speaking reducing the incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy has the greatest impact for those women who are older (because their embryos are more likely to be aneuploid in the first place) and lesser impact for those women who are younger (because their embryos are less likely to be aneuploid in the first place). 
 
A quick and dirty way to understand this is to filter the ‪SART.org‬ national reports to compare live birth rates for those using PGT-A versus those not using PGT-A.  For example, based on the most recent complete data set available (the 2017 SART National Report https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?reportingYear=2017), women aged 35 or younger who *did not* use PGT-A had a live birth success rate *per first transfer* of 46.7%, while the live birth success rate *per first transfer* for women of the same age who *did* use PGT-A was 57% (an improvement of about 10%).  Conversely, women aged 38-40 who *did not* use PGT-A had an overall *per first transfer* live birth success rate of 27.7%, while the *per first transfer* live birth success rate for women of the same age who *did* use PGT-A was 52.9% (an improvement of about 25%). 
 
Other research bears this out (i.e., that use of PGT-A for embryos created using eggs from women aged 35 years or younger has less dramatic impact on outcome than the use of PGT-A for embryos created using eggs from women older than that).  (See, e.g., https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-018-01399-1 ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0015028217302546 ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455919300130 )
 

For this reason, many REs recommend against using PGT-A on the blastocysts of younger women, on the grounds that the margin of expected improvement may not be worth the extra monetary cost/small risk to the embryo.  However, whether that is the right approach for your particular circumstance is really up to you.
 
###Is using PGT-A screening likely to improve YOUR chances of success? The impacts of pregnancy loss history and embryo transfer history.
The use of PGT-A has also been demonstrated to be beneficial for patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and/or repeat implantation failure (RIF), more or less evening the playing field to result in success rates closer to those experienced by younger-egg-aged patients without RPL or RIF. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455919300130 ; https://www.asrm.org/news-and-publications/news-and-research/press-releases-and-bulletins/preimplantation-genetic-testing-for-chromosomal-defects-improves-ivf-outcomes-in-patients-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/ . 
 
###Your tolerance for risk.
As noted above, although with current techniques the rates of embryo damage/loss have been reduced and are low, they are not zero. And, although the level of concordance between the biopsied trophectoderm cells (the part that might develop into a placenta) and the inner cell mass of the embryo (the part that  might develop into a fetus) is high, it is also not 100%; hence the roughly 2% error rate reported by PGS labs. In light of the fact that embryos whose biopsies are reported as “abnormal” will virtually always be discarded, if you are not willing to accept that level of risk of embryo damage, or risk of discarding an embryo that was reported as “abnormal” but was actually euploid or mosaic, then PGT-A screening is probably not for you.
 

Conversely, if you would prefer to take steps to try to increase the likelihood of live birth on a per-transfer basis by reducing the risk of implantation failure or pregnancy loss (e.g., if you are not willing to tolerate your baseline risk of implantation failure/pregnancy loss based on your egg age), then PGT-A screening may be a good choice for you.
 
##WHAT PGT-A CAN and CAN’T DO. MORE PROS AND CONS.
PGT-A can’t fix or change aneuploid embryos: at most it may be able to identify them.

 
PGT-A is a useful tool, but it is not a guarantee of success. Critics of PGT-A screening often express concern that ART patients may get the impression that using PGT-A screening makes IVF/ICSI a sure thing. But, as noted above, the per-transfer live birth rates for couples using PGT-A screening is in the 50-60% range. So, although it is a good tool in many instances, it’s not a silver bullet.

 
PGT-A presently cannot consistently detect genetic anomalies smaller than the presence of too few or too many of a particular chromosome: metaphorically, it can identify missing or duplicate chapters (chromosomes) within the genetic book, but it cannot identify typographical errors within those chapters. For example, PGT-A screening is not used to detect microdeletions or microadditions within or among chromosomes; or translocations where genetic material is present, but it is located in a problematic place within the chromosome. All of those things can cause an embryo to develop improperly, or fail to implant, or cause pregnancy loss, or cause congenital health problems for a resulting child. Other types of testing may be available to address these issues (e.g., PGT-SR to identify translocations), but that’s beyond the scope of this post. [**Note**: see comment below for further clarification.]
 

PGT-A presently can sometimes – but not always – detect genetic anomalies in which the cells of the biopsied embryo contain too many copies of the *entire set* of chromosomes (**polyploid**): metaphorically, it can identify when the genetic book contains duplicates of some chapters, but it cannot always identify when there are too many duplicated books. For example, **triploidy** is a type of chromosomal aneuploidy in which there are 3 entire sets of chromosomes within the cell (i.e., 69 chromosomes instead of the usual 46). Similarly, **tetraploidy** is a type of chromosomal aneuploidy in which there are 4 sets of chromosomes within the cell (i.e., 96 chromosomes instead of the usual 46).  https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/triploidy/ ; https://ir.invitae.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Invitae-Presents-Validation-of-a-Novel-NGS-based-Preimplantation-Genetic-Screening-Technology-to-Identify-the-Most-Frequent-Chromosomal-Causes-of-Miscarriage/default.aspx ; https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31324-9/pdf ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637680/ ; https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/veriseq-pgs/veriseq-pgs-technical-guide-to-aneuploidy-calling-15059470-a.pdf . All of those things can cause an embryo to develop improperly, or fail to implant, or cause pregnancy loss, or cause congenital health problems for a resulting child.

<h1>THE VERY BASICS: What is PGS / PGT-A? Useful definitions.</h1>

<p><strong>PGS</strong> stands for “preimplantation genetic screening”: screening one or more embryos for certain genetic content, in order to help decide <em>whether</em> to attempt to transfer the screened embryo into an uterus, and if so <em>in what order</em> (e.g., to rank the order in which embryos will be used to attempt transfer, if at all). In broad terms, such testing is generally done by taking a biopsy of several cells from the trophectoderm of a developing embryo (aka trophoblast, the part that may eventually develop into a placenta <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/blastocyst"">https://www.britannica.com/science/blastocyst</a>  ), and running various tests on those biopsied cells. What types of tests are run depends upon what type of pre-implantation genetic screening is being conducted.</p>

<p> 
<strong>PGT-A</strong> (“preimplantation genetic testing – aneuploidy”, sometimes also referred to as  <strong>CCS</strong>, comprehensive chromosome screening) is a particular type of PGS, which screens embryos for numerical chromosomal aneuploidy to determine whether the embryo has the proper number of chromosomes. (<a href=""https://ormgenomics.com/2018/09/20/pgt-what-does-it-all-mean/"">https://ormgenomics.com/2018/09/20/pgt-what-does-it-all-mean/</a> ) There are also other types of preimplantation genetic screening, which screen for other types of genetic anomalies (<strong>PGT-SR</strong>, which screens for structural rearrangements, e.g., translocations, within a particular chromosome; <strong>PGD</strong> [preimplantation diagnosis] / <strong>PGT-M</strong>, which screens for single-gene / inheritable diseases and syndromes).  <em>Ibid.</em>  <strong>Most commonly, when people refer to “PGS” generically, they are usually referring to screening for numerical chromosomal aneuploidy, i.e., PGT-A, even though the term actually has a broader meaning.</strong> Likewise, older literature sometimes uses the terms “PGS” and “PGD” interchangeably, whereas more recent literature is more careful to use the more specific meanings.</p>

<h1>WHAT PROBLEMS IS PGT-A SCREENING TRYING TO SOLVE? WHAT OUTCOMES IS PGT-A TRYING TO IMPROVE?</h1>

<p>Genetic aneuploidy in an embryo, and in particular non-inherited <em>numerical chromosomal aneuploidy</em> in embryos (having the wrong number of chromosomes) is by far the primary cause of post-conception pregnancy loss (in particular chemical pregnancies and miscarriages at other stages), accounting for roughly 40-65% of all pregnancy losses/miscarriages: this is true for both spontaneously conceived pregnancies, and for ART pregnancies such as IUI and IVF/ICSI pregnancies. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4729087/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4729087/</a> ; <a href=""https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2018/11/early-pregnancy-loss"">https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2018/11/early-pregnancy-loss</a> ; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4736891/#:%7E:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20chromosomal%20abnormalities%20are,to%20test%20aneuploidy%20in%20miscarriage"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4736891/#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20chromosomal%20abnormalities%20are,to%20test%20aneuploidy%20in%20miscarriage</a>. ; <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-009-9292-z.%C2%A0"">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-009-9292-z. </a> Certain types of chromosomal aneuploidies can cause either pregnancy loss (or implantation failure), or in other instances can cause congenital health problems in a resulting child.  E.g., trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome); trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome); trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome); Turner Syndrome (whole or partial monosomy X); Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), etc.</p>

<p> 
So, the idea is that avoiding the transfer of embryos with demonstrated genetic aneuploidy would logically (1) reduce the rate of post-transfer pregnancy loss and the rate of congenital birth defects; and conversely (2) increase the rate of successful live birth in general, and increase the rate of successful live birth without congenital defects in particular. Presumably, this increase in success rates <em>on a per-transfer basis</em> would also (3) reduce the time it takes (and the number of transfers it takes) to achieve a live birth. <em>One or all of these three goals are generally what PGT-A is used to try to achieve.</em>
 </p>

<h3><em>But, how to know whether the embryos you have available are chromosomally aneuploid or not?</em></h3>

<p> 
The morphology of a blastocyst-stage embryo – what its shape looks like visually (aka its “grade”) - is very subjective, and isn’t a great predictor of whether an embryo is/isn’t chromosomally competent to potentially result in a live birth of a genetically normal baby.  Although “better” graded embryos more frequently tend to be <strong>euploid</strong> (having the correct set of 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes plus one pair of sex chromosomes for a total of 23 pairs/46 total chromosomes) than “poorer” graded embryos, this isn’t always true; and attempting to detect aneuploidy/euploidy based on morphology/grading has a high rate of error (in the range of approximately 30%-60% equivalent error rate). <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405648/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405648/</a> ; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6133810/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6133810/</a> ; <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/29/6/1173/624854"">https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/29/6/1173/624854</a> [“A moderate relation between blastocyst morphology and CCS data was observed but <em>the ability to implant seems to be mainly determined by the chromosomal complement of preimplantation embryos rather than developmental and morphological parameters</em> conventionally used for blastocyst evaluation” (emphasis added)] <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5982556/."">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5982556/.</a>)    
 
As discussed below, <strong>in comparison to embryo morphology/grading, PGT-A is a better predictor of whether an embryo is/isn’t chromosomally competent to potentially result in a live birth of a genetically normal baby</strong>.  And, although it isn’t 100% accurate, PGT-A it is the best predictor presently available.

<h2>RELEVANT HISTORY OF PGS/PGT-A SCREENING, and A NOTE ABOUT PRE-2016 LITERATURE/RESEARCH.</h2>

<p>PGS/PGT-A screening is a very new and rapidly developing tool. Prior to about 2013-2016, physicians, embryologists, and researchers used different techniques for PGS/PGT-A than they do today. The medical field went from not testing for chromosomal aneuploidy at all, to testing for only a few chromosomes within the biopsy, to — starting in about 2013-2016 — testing for all 23 sets of chromosomes; went from using slower embryo freezing technologies to using the almost-immediate vitrification freezing approach, which now has higher rates of successful thawing and has minimized the small likelihood of damage to the embryo in that process; went from reporting only “normal” vs “abnormal” determinations regarding each tested embryo, to reporting the more specific “normal”, “abnormal”, “mosaic”, and “no result” (further discussion of these reported result types below); improved biopsy and Petri dish culturing methods; and so on. The end result (so far) of these improvements has been increased accuracy of testing; reduced likelihood of embryo damage/embryo loss from the PGT-A biopsy/freezing/screening process; and, when PGT-A screened “normal” embryos are transferred, increased implantation rates and reduced pregnancy loss rates (and corollary increased live birth rates on a per-transfer basis). (<a href=""https://ivf-worldwide.com/cogen/oep/pgd-pgs/history-of-pgd-and-pgs.html%C2%A0;%C2%A0https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6333033/%C2%A0;%C2%A0https://www.ivf-hub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Scott-Typeset-for-publishing-v4-28SEP2019.pdf%C2%A0"">https://ivf-worldwide.com/cogen/oep/pgd-pgs/history-of-pgd-and-pgs.html ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6333033/ ; https://www.ivf-hub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Scott-Typeset-for-publishing-v4-28SEP2019.pdf </a>).
 
Since these technologies and techniques were only developed and came into broader use between roughly 2013-2016 and the present, the related scientific research discussing these newer techniques only began to be published in approximately 2013-2016, at the earliest. So, it is important to note that <em>research papers discussing PGS/PGT-A which were published prior to about 2016, or which were published later but examine research conducted prior to about 2016, often (but not always) pertain to techniques which are no longer in widespread use today</em>, and as a result the findings of such research papers may not be applicable to the PGS/PGT-A screening being offered by REs today.
 </p>

<h1>How does it work?  What do the lab folks do in PGT-A?</h1>

<p>For PGT-A, an embryologist takes a biopsy of cells from the <strong>trophectoderm</strong> (outer rim of cells that may develop into a placenta) of a 5-7 day embryo (<strong>blastocyst</strong>), and then sends them to a separate lab for analysis.  That separate lab amplifies the genetic data within the biopsied cells/cell lines, and runs various tests to determine whether the cell lines/genetic data derived from those biopsied cells have the correct number of each chromosome (<strong>euploid</strong> cells having 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes plus one pair of sex chromosomes for a total of 23 pairs/46 total chromosomes); or an incorrect number of one or more of the sets of chromosomes (<strong>aneuploid</strong>); or some cell lines with the correct number of chromosomes and some cell lines with an incorrect number of chromosomes (a <strong>mosaic</strong> biopsy). 
 </p>

<h1>Understanding your PGT-A lab report.</h1>

<p>After running the screening process, the lab reports the findings of these trophectoderm biopsies as follows: Normal, abnormal, mosaicism, or “no result”. There are some methodological nuances that differ based on the specific type of PGT-A test done and may differ from lab to lab, but generally speaking, for a particular embryo, if all of the cell lines/amplified DNA content derived from that embryo’s biopsy are euploid the embryo is reported as “<strong>normal</strong>”; if all of the cell lines/amplified DNA content derived from that embryo’s biopsy are aneuploid the embryo is reported as “<strong>abnormal</strong>”; and if some of the cell lines/amplified DNA derived from that embryo’s biopsy are euploid and some are aneuploid, then the embryo is reported as “<strong>mosaic</strong>”.  (Further explanation of mosaicism here: <a href=""https://www.coopergenomics.com/blog/during-ivf/mosaicism-what-we-know-what-we-dont-know/"">https://www.coopergenomics.com/blog/during-ivf/mosaicism-what-we-know-what-we-dont-know/</a>) <em>Note, however, that some labs still report embryos with mosaic biopsies as “abnormal” – if you are considering PGT-A testing, you should ask your RE whether the lab they use reports mosaics.</em>  Based on these reported results, “normal” embryos would be preferred for transfer because they have the highest likelihood of success, mosaic embryos might be considered for transfer but are not preferred (further discussion below), and “abnormal” embryos are generally discarded (donated to science or whatever you contracted with your RE to do with them when you signed the PGS/PGT-A paperwork). 
 </p>

<h2>Concordance / Discordance between the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass.</h2>

<p>When designating an embryo “normal” or “abnormal” or “mosaic” based on the trophectoderm biopsy, PGT-A screening assumes that the cells in the trophectoderm of the embryo (which can develop into a placenta if all goes well) match the cells in the inner cell mass of the embryo (which can develop into a fetus if all goes well). In other words, assumes that there is “concordance” between the cells in these two parts of the embryo.  It appears that there is usually – but not always – concordance between the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass: concordance rates seem to be somewhere between 86% - 97%. (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/24/12/593/5145914"">https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/24/12/593/5145914</a> ; <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/26/4/269/5721558%C2%A0"">https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/26/4/269/5721558 </a>; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6262631/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6262631/</a> ; <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1472648319301579"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1472648319301579</a> ; <a href=""https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31359-6/pdf"">https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31359-6/pdf</a> .)  Thus, <em>although the PGT-A process is pretty reliable, it is not 100% accurate</em> (and, no one worth their salt claims it is – even the PGS labs acknowledge this [e.g., Progenesis reports approximately 98% accuracy rate/2% error rate, <a href=""https://www.progenesis.com/overview-of-pgd-technology/"">https://www.progenesis.com/overview-of-pgd-technology/</a> ]; Igenomix, same rates, <a href=""https://www.igenomix.com/genetic-solutions/pgt-a-preimplantation-genetic-testing-aneuploidies/"">https://www.igenomix.com/genetic-solutions/pgt-a-preimplantation-genetic-testing-aneuploidies/</a> ;  Cooper Genomics, same rates <a href=""https://www.coopergenomics.com/blog/during-ivf/mosaicism-what-we-know-what-we-dont-know/%5D"">https://www.coopergenomics.com/blog/during-ivf/mosaicism-what-we-know-what-we-dont-know/]</a>).
 
<strong>Note:</strong> The research behind trophectoderm/inner cell mass concordance (matching) or discordance (not matching) is still developing and is a very new (and therefore contentious) area of research.  Some reasons that have been proposed to explain incidents of discordance between the euploid/aneuploid status of an embryo’s trophectoderm/inner cell mass include:  errors introduced in the laboratory processes (e.g., accidental contamination during biopsy, cell growth, etc.); embryos “repairing” themselves during development by “pushing” aneuploid cells out of the inner cell mass and into the trophectoderm, thereby tending to result in a euploid inner cell mass but reflecting trophectoderm cells which read as aneuploid or mosaic when biopsied; mosaicism in trophectoderm cells being more common and less problematic than previously thought, therefore resulting in a more common baseline range of discordance between the inner cell mass and trophectoderm of embryos in general.  This is still an emerging area of research.
 </p>

<h2>What if your PGT-A lab result is “No result”?</h2>

<p>If for some reason the lab was not able to determine the chromosomal status of the cells biopsied from a particular embryo, that is reported as “<strong>no result</strong>” or “no DNA” or “no diagnosis” or similar phrasing. This could happen for any number of reasons, including but not limited to: too few cells obtained in the biopsy, contamination or damage to the biopsy in the lab or in transit, the biopsied cells failed to grow, sufficient DNA to run the tests couldn’t be extracted from the biopsied cells, etc.  If this happens, you may have the option of thawing that embryo, having it re-biopsied (and then re-frozen) and screened again. As you might expect, this second biopsy process increases the risk of damage to the embryo, although the vast majority survive the process and are able to re-thaw for later transfer if necessary. (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24794643/%C2%A0;%C2%A0https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(16)61897-6/pdf%C2%A0;%C2%A0https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31343-2/fulltext"">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24794643/ ; https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(16)61897-6/pdf ; https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31343-2/fulltext</a> ) And, if a PGT-A screened “normal” twice-biopsied embryo is transferred, there does not seem to be a significant reduction in the chance of live birth versus a “normal” embryo that was only biopsied once. (<a href=""https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(18)30156-0/fulltext"">https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(18)30156-0/fulltext</a>).  However, as you might imagine, the body of research on this topic is very small, so especially in this area your mileage may vary. </p>

<h1>IS PGT-A RIGHT FOR YOU? THINGS TO CONSIDER and DISCUSS WITH YOUR RE WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO PURSUE PGS/PGT-A SCREENING.</h1>

<h3>Philosophical / religious considerations.</h3>

<p>PGT-A screening does involve taking cells from each embryo for biopsy; and, although with current techniques the rates of embryo damage/loss have been reduced and are low, they are not zero. And, embryos whose biopsies are reported as “abnormal” will virtually always be discarded. If any of that doesn’t jive with your personal beliefs or preferences, then PGT-A screening is probably not for you.
 </p>

<h3>Will you have the opportunity to do a frozen embryo transfer (“FET”)?</h3>

<p>Logistically, because of how long it takes to conduct the laboratory processes and report the results, PGT-A screening cannot be conducted on an embryo that will be used for a fresh transfer (although if additional blastocysts are available you still may be able to do PGT-A on any other blastocysts that result from that egg retrieval cycle).  This might happen if you are participating in a shared risk program that requires a fresh transfer; or if there are cleavage-stage embryos available but they don’t look likely to survive/develop to blastocyst stage so would need to be transferred ASAP in order to have a chance; etc. 
 </p>

<h3>Timing concerns, and Whether you are trying to bank embryos.</h3>

<p>Some insurance coverages require you to attempt transfer of all available embryos before the insurance will cover another egg retrieval cycle.  If so, using PGT-A to pare down the number of embryos available for potential transfer (by designating any “abnormal” and/or “mosaic” embryos as unavailable for transfer) may help reduce the number of transfers you will have to attempt (and therefore the time those take) before you would become eligible for another covered egg retrieval. 
 
Likewise, the initial FET process itself, and the resolution of any subsequent pregnancy loss from an unsuccessful transfer, both can take significant time – weeks or months depending upon your particular circumstances. So, if you improve your per-transfer success rate, you may be able to reach the end goal of a live birth with fewer FET attempts (and therefore sooner) than if you had attempted to transfer each un-screened embryo consecutively. 
 </p>

<h3>Would you want to have the option to transfer a mosaic embryo? Will your RE transfer a mosaic embryo?</h3>

<p>Virtually all REs will refuse to transfer an embryo whose PGT-A biopsy has been reported as “abnormal”. So, if you think you might want to have the option of transferring a mosaic embryo (e.g., if no remaining “normal” embryos are available), it is important to find out ahead of time (1) whether the lab that will screen your embryo biopsies reports mosaic results as “abnormal” or as “mosaic”, and (2) what is your RE’s policy regarding the possibility of transferring mosaic embryos. 
 
For REs who will consider transferring mosaic embryos, a common approach is to rank embryos for transfer as follows: first, “normal” embryos that also have “good” morphology/grading (if any); second, “normal” embryos that have lesser morphology/grading (if any); then mosaic embryos last (if any). Further, there may be particular types of aneuploidy demonstrated in a mosaic embryo regarding which you (or your RE) may not be comfortable transferring. When deciding whether to transfer a mosaic embryo, you may find it helpful to consult with a genetic counselor: most labs which run PGT-A testing also provide phone access to genetic counselors.   
 </p>

<h3>How many blastocysts are in play?</h3>

<p>If there are no blastocysts available for biopsy, PGT-A screening is obviously not an option.  Similarly, if your egg retrieval results in only a few blastocysts (one, two, three, etc.), it may be more time efficient and financially efficient to proceed with transferring one or more of those embryos without PGT-A screening; and the impact of risking potential damage to those few embryos or the impact of risking potential erroneous screening (potentially resulting in no blastocysts to transfer) may be relatively more important.  <strong>Note</strong>: This is often why critics of PGT-A correctly point out that, while PGT-A may increase the rate of success on a <em>per-transfer</em> basis, for patients who are less likely to yield any or many blastocysts in a particular egg retrieval cycle (e.g., due to POF, DOR, ovary loss, reduced response to stims, sperm quality issues, or any other reason), PGT-A isn’t particularly helpful and may not increase the likelihood of success on a <em>per-cycle</em> basis.
 </p>

<p>Conversely, if your egg retrieval cycle results in many embryos, it may be more time efficient, financially efficient, and potentially more emotionally tolerable to proceed with PGT-A screening to pare down the number of blastocysts to only those that are reported as “normal” or “mosaic”, so as to avoid spending time, money, and emotional energy trying to transfer embryos with no or very low likelihood of success (e.g., by weeding out known “abnormals”) trying to find the proverbial “normal” needle in the haystack.</p>

<p> 
What the magic number is for you will of course depend on your own personal circumstances and appetite for risk – e.g., Will you proceed with PGT-A no matter how many blastocysts you get? Only if you get 3 or more? Only if you get 8 or more? Something else?
 </p>

<h3>How much will PGT-A cost in general? And, is that cost more or less than the cost of a frozen embryo transfer (“FET”)?</h3>

<p>PGT-A screening isn’t cheap, and is not affordable for everyone.  <em>Just like PGT-A isn’t a guarantee of success, if you can’t afford PGT-A or otherwise decide not to pursue it, that’s not a guarantee of failure either.</em>
 
Depending upon the lab and your RE clinic, PGT-A screening is sometimes paid for on a per-embryo basis, and sometimes paid for as a flat rate for screening several embryos at once (e.g., often a flat rate for screening up to 8 embryos).  So, this is another layer of decision-making to consider when determining what your “magic number” might be.
 
If you end up with many blastocysts, it may be overall less expensive to pay to proceed with PGT-A screening so as to reduce the number of blastocysts you would consider transferring, and concurrently increasing your chances of success on a per-transfer basis; than it would be to pay for multiple consecutive FETs trying to transfer each embryo one at a time (or even two at a time).  Of course, the math of these finances will depend upon the costs of FETs at your clinic, the costs of FET medications, what you may have to pay for PGT-A, and how many blastocysts you have available/want to test.

<h3>Does PGT-A screening require the use of ICSI, or can it be done with plain-vanilla IVF?</h3>

<p>PGT-A screening does not inherently require the use of more-expensive ICSI; the PGT-A biopsying can also be done in an IVF cycle.  However, it is common for RE clinics to require ICSI when opting for PGT-A.  While ICSI may not be necessary in general, it may be that your RE/embryologist feels more comfortable doing PGT-A biopsy when they’ve had control over the entire embryo-creation process from the start (i.e., including selection of the sperm with which to fertilize the egg via ICSI); they may feel they get better results/less embryo loss/damage when they do biopsy after ICSI versus after IVF;… or they straight up may be trying to squeeze you for extra money (because ICSI costs more than IVF).  If you are concerned about this, talk to your clinic about whether (and why) they do/don’t require ICSI with PGT-A.
 </p>

<h3>Is using PGT-A screening likely to improve YOUR chances of success? The impacts of egg age.</h3>

<p>As noted above, chromosomal aneuploidy is the primary cause of pregnancy loss.  The rates of incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy (and pregnancy loss due to aneuploidy) increase dramatically with age; and this is true for both spontaneous pregnancies, and ART pregnancies. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC27416/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC27416/</a> ; <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075953"">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075953</a>. The likelihood of a particular embryo being aneuploid depends a lot on the <strong>age of the eggs being used</strong> (the age of the woman from whom the eggs were retrieved, whether a donor or autologous cycle). <strong>This article sets out the expected range of percentage of “normal” vs. “abnormal” embryos based on maternal/egg age</strong>, and also has a very useful discussion of the likelihood of obtaining any blastocysts to test in the first place based on maternal/egg age: <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216000662"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216000662</a> (if you want the cliff-notes version, scroll down to the colorful graphs).</p>

<p> 
So, although reducing the rate of incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy would be helpful for reducing the likelihood of pregnancy loss in women of any age, generally  speaking reducing the incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy has the greatest impact for those women who are older (because their embryos are more likely to be aneuploid in the first place) and lesser impact for those women who are younger (because their embryos are less likely to be aneuploid in the first place). 
 
A quick and dirty way to understand this is to filter the ‪SART.org‬ national reports to compare live birth rates for those using PGT-A versus those not using PGT-A.  For example, based on the most recent complete data set available (the 2017 SART National Report <a href=""https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?reportingYear=2017"">https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?reportingYear=2017</a>), women aged 35 or younger who <em>did not</em> use PGT-A had a live birth success rate <em>per first transfer</em> of 46.7%, while the live birth success rate <em>per first transfer</em> for women of the same age who <em>did</em> use PGT-A was 57% (an improvement of about 10%).  Conversely, women aged 38-40 who <em>did not</em> use PGT-A had an overall <em>per first transfer</em> live birth success rate of 27.7%, while the <em>per first transfer</em> live birth success rate for women of the same age who <em>did</em> use PGT-A was 52.9% (an improvement of about 25%). 
 
Other research bears this out (i.e., that use of PGT-A for embryos created using eggs from women aged 35 years or younger has less dramatic impact on outcome than the use of PGT-A for embryos created using eggs from women older than that).  (See, e.g., <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-018-01399-1"">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-018-01399-1</a> ; <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0015028217302546"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0015028217302546</a> ; <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455919300130"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455919300130</a> )
 </p>

<p>For this reason, many REs recommend against using PGT-A on the blastocysts of younger women, on the grounds that the margin of expected improvement may not be worth the extra monetary cost/small risk to the embryo.  However, whether that is the right approach for your particular circumstance is really up to you.
 </p>

<h3>Is using PGT-A screening likely to improve YOUR chances of success? The impacts of pregnancy loss history and embryo transfer history.</h3>

<p>The use of PGT-A has also been demonstrated to be beneficial for patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and/or repeat implantation failure (RIF), more or less evening the playing field to result in success rates closer to those experienced by younger-egg-aged patients without RPL or RIF. <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455919300130"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455919300130</a> ; <a href=""https://www.asrm.org/news-and-publications/news-and-research/press-releases-and-bulletins/preimplantation-genetic-testing-for-chromosomal-defects-improves-ivf-outcomes-in-patients-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/"">https://www.asrm.org/news-and-publications/news-and-research/press-releases-and-bulletins/preimplantation-genetic-testing-for-chromosomal-defects-improves-ivf-outcomes-in-patients-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/</a> . 
 </p>

<h3>Your tolerance for risk.</h3>

<p>As noted above, although with current techniques the rates of embryo damage/loss have been reduced and are low, they are not zero. And, although the level of concordance between the biopsied trophectoderm cells (the part that might develop into a placenta) and the inner cell mass of the embryo (the part that  might develop into a fetus) is high, it is also not 100%; hence the roughly 2% error rate reported by PGS labs. In light of the fact that embryos whose biopsies are reported as “abnormal” will virtually always be discarded, if you are not willing to accept that level of risk of embryo damage, or risk of discarding an embryo that was reported as “abnormal” but was actually euploid or mosaic, then PGT-A screening is probably not for you.
 </p>

<p>Conversely, if you would prefer to take steps to try to increase the likelihood of live birth on a per-transfer basis by reducing the risk of implantation failure or pregnancy loss (e.g., if you are not willing to tolerate your baseline risk of implantation failure/pregnancy loss based on your egg age), then PGT-A screening may be a good choice for you.
 </p>

<h2>WHAT PGT-A CAN and CAN’T DO. MORE PROS AND CONS.</h2>

<p>PGT-A can’t fix or change aneuploid embryos: at most it may be able to identify them.</p>

<p> 
PGT-A is a useful tool, but it is not a guarantee of success. Critics of PGT-A screening often express concern that ART patients may get the impression that using PGT-A screening makes IVF/ICSI a sure thing. But, as noted above, the per-transfer live birth rates for couples using PGT-A screening is in the 50-60% range. So, although it is a good tool in many instances, it’s not a silver bullet.</p>

<p> 
PGT-A presently cannot consistently detect genetic anomalies smaller than the presence of too few or too many of a particular chromosome: metaphorically, it can identify missing or duplicate chapters (chromosomes) within the genetic book, but it cannot identify typographical errors within those chapters. For example, PGT-A screening is not used to detect microdeletions or microadditions within or among chromosomes; or translocations where genetic material is present, but it is located in a problematic place within the chromosome. All of those things can cause an embryo to develop improperly, or fail to implant, or cause pregnancy loss, or cause congenital health problems for a resulting child. Other types of testing may be available to address these issues (e.g., PGT-SR to identify translocations), but that’s beyond the scope of this post. [<strong>Note</strong>: see comment below for further clarification.]
 </p>

<p>PGT-A presently can sometimes – but not always – detect genetic anomalies in which the cells of the biopsied embryo contain too many copies of the <em>entire set</em> of chromosomes (<strong>polyploid</strong>): metaphorically, it can identify when the genetic book contains duplicates of some chapters, but it cannot always identify when there are too many duplicated books. For example, <strong>triploidy</strong> is a type of chromosomal aneuploidy in which there are 3 entire sets of chromosomes within the cell (i.e., 69 chromosomes instead of the usual 46). Similarly, <strong>tetraploidy</strong> is a type of chromosomal aneuploidy in which there are 4 sets of chromosomes within the cell (i.e., 96 chromosomes instead of the usual 46).  <a href=""https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/triploidy/"">https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/triploidy/</a> ; <a href=""https://ir.invitae.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Invitae-Presents-Validation-of-a-Novel-NGS-based-Preimplantation-Genetic-Screening-Technology-to-Identify-the-Most-Frequent-Chromosomal-Causes-of-Miscarriage/default.aspx"">https://ir.invitae.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Invitae-Presents-Validation-of-a-Novel-NGS-based-Preimplantation-Genetic-Screening-Technology-to-Identify-the-Most-Frequent-Chromosomal-Causes-of-Miscarriage/default.aspx</a> ; <a href=""https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31324-9/pdf"">https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(17)31324-9/pdf</a> ; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637680/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637680/</a> ; <a href=""https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/veriseq-pgs/veriseq-pgs-technical-guide-to-aneuploidy-calling-15059470-a.pdf"">https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/veriseq-pgs/veriseq-pgs-technical-guide-to-aneuploidy-calling-15059470-a.pdf</a> .

Hello everyone, I’m sorry that we’re all here, but glad that we can support each other. 

I’m 36 and my partner is 39. We’ve been trying to conceive for two years. I’ve had three pregnancies in that time, all of which ended in loss. #1 took six cycles to conceive and ended in miscarriage at 8w due to trisomy 16; #2 took three cycles to conceive and ended in termination at 15w due to trisomy 13; #3 took seven cycles to conceive and ended in miscarriage at 11w due to trisomy 13.

For those of you who’ve struggled with multiple losses, particularly due to chromosomal issues: did you get any additional testing that you found helpful? How did you decide on next steps? We’ll be meeting with our OB and a genetic counselor soon, and I want to make sure we advocate for ourselves well.

We’re leaning towards giving up on trying to conceive on our own and moving to IVF so we can do PGS, since all of our losses have been due to aneuploidies. Others with multiple aneuploid losses: did you switch to IVF at some point? Why or why not?

* First round IVF+ICSI (due to MFI) planned end of October/beginning november, due to my husband taking part in supplement study
* Only factor making me not wanting to delay as little as possible is the age of my husband (44 later this year)
* my husband doesn't want to do any extra's, he's just trusting the system and doctors here, so I would probably need to push a bit if I want to do this test (over the border is for him out of question at the moment)
* Netherlands:
   * 3 to 4 rounds are covered,
   * no ERA, receptivaDX or anything like that is possible here, we would have to go to Germany and do that OOP, also even if we would, it's questionable results would or could be taken into account with treatment, I also cant do a biopsy to determine chronic endometritis (although I think when they did the pathology on the removed polyp, there was no indication of ongoing inflammation, and  also the endometrium *looked* alright)
   * I can only do freeze all, if I get OHSS (though I am high risk with PCOS and high AFC), otherwise you're required to do a fresh transfer if you got embryos (but because its a dutch test, done in dutch hospitals, they MIGHT take the outcome into account and do a freeze all, and make some reason up for the insurance)
   * standard is 3 day transfer (although maybe I could take part in a study, but then its still a roll of dice if its 3 or 5 day transfer)
   * receptIVFity is the only test I could do here, in another clinic OOP, but not super expensive (360€), its non-invasive and it won't take long, so I could probably still do it before starting

Questions:

* what do you think on the scientific validation of the test?
* what are your general thoughts about microbiome and implantation?
* Would you do it if you were in my situation?
* what do you think of the mental aspect?
* I am kind of thinking, maybe just try out one round and see how it goes, and then before the second round go all nuts on OOP tests (DNA frag, ERA in Germany.. maybe this..) but maybe I am underestimating the mental strain on a failed round?
* how to interpret  sensitivity, 26%; specificity, 97% ?
* why can it still be predicitive (if it is) when hormones during stims probably change the microbiome significantly? Do you think it would still give you an idea for a FET?? Might the microbiome in an unmedicated FET cycle maybe be more favorable?

<li>how to interpret  sensitivity, 26%; specificity, 97% ?</li>
<li>why can it still be predicitive (if it is) when hormones during stims probably change the microbiome significantly? Do you think it would still give you an idea for a FET?? Might the microbiome in an unmedicated FET cycle maybe be more favorable?<br/></li>

My husband and I just found out about three weeks ago that I have severe DOR, and he has some sperm issues. It has made our chances of becoming pregnant on our own pretty much nonexistent and our chances of success with ART pretty lackluster as well. It has been crushing news. It makes you question your body, choices you’ve made...even your identity. About a week after we got the bad news, we picked up a little kitten (we had started the adoption process prior to our news), and I can’t help but be so grateful for the perfect timing. She’s so lovey and affectionate. She makes me laugh constantly. I am just so grateful for this tiny little comfort in a time when I need comfort and affection more than anything. And it has made me stop to think about - in a time when I feel like things are so horribly wrong - what I have that’s right. 

So I guess my question is - what gets you through your fertility struggle? Is it a loving partner? A pet? Your mother? A job that gives you purpose? Of course, none of these things can replace our ultimate goal, and I certainly don’t mean to suggest that they could.

257,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So my follow-up with my RE had me in tears as she suggested Lupron for 3 months before my next retrieval, and it had me really scared, because my last RE didn't want to put me on it for fear my ovaries wouldn't wake up again after. I already seem to be a low/poor responder to stims. My RE listened to my fears (even though she thinks it's not possible for ovaries to just shut down form a few months of Lupron) and she is considering an agonist protocol for me instead, but we're going to talk about protocol in more detail in 2 weeks after she looks into a few things for me.

I feel like she's trying to address the endo, but my AMH is also low at 6pmol (0.84ng/mL I think). I feel like the endo is less of an issue and I'm more concerned with getting more good quality eggs, and my last cycle with microdose Lupron was the worst one so far. She said that the Lupron would not have affected maturity, but I didn't have this issue when I didn't prime with Lupron. She said I responded well to the meds and my follicles were appropriately sized to have mature eggs, they just didn't. It was also less follicles than my first round.

Now I'm anxious because:

\- What if I trust my RE's Lupron plan and it goes terribly again- What if she listens to me and I'm wrong and it also goes terribly- I turn 35 next year and that basically is where my next retrieval would be if we do the Lupron thing and I feel like age/time is not on my side for the Lupron plan.

Anyone with endo/DOR have a depo Lupron before retrieval? I have heard of people having success with it as prep for transfers, but it always seems to me that it seems like a bad idea before retreivals due to ovarian suppression. She says the data reflects better success for endo patients to do the Lupron, but what about those with endo AND low AMH/poor response/potentially DOR?

Anyone have positive stories for their retrievals/blast rate from doing 1-3 months of depo Lupron?

I already seem to be a low/poor responder to stims. My RE listened to my fears (even though she thinks it&#39;s not possible for ovaries to just shut down form a few months of Lupron) and she is considering an agonist protocol for me instead, but we&#39;re going to talk about protocol in more detail in 2 weeks after she looks into a few things for me.</p>

<p>I feel like she&#39;s trying to address the endo, but my AMH is also low at 6pmol (0.84ng/mL I think). I feel like the endo is less of an issue and I&#39;m more concerned with getting more good quality eggs, and my last cycle with microdose Lupron was the worst one so far. She said that the Lupron would not have affected maturity, but I didn&#39;t have this issue when I didn&#39;t prime with Lupron. She said I responded well to the meds and my follicles were appropriately sized to have mature eggs, they just didn&#39;t. It was also less follicles than my first round.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m anxious because:</p>

<p>- What if I trust my RE&#39;s Lupron plan and it goes terribly again- What if she listens to me and I&#39;m wrong and it also goes terribly- I turn 35 next year and that basically is where my next retrieval would be if we do the Lupron thing and I feel like age/time is not on my side for the Lupron plan.</p>

<p>Anyone with endo/DOR have a depo Lupron before retrieval? I have heard of people having success with it as prep for transfers, but it always seems to me that it seems like a bad idea before retreivals due to ovarian suppression. She says the data reflects better success for endo patients to do the Lupron, but what about those with endo AND low AMH/poor response/potentially DOR?</p>

<p>Anyone have positive stories for their retrievals/blast rate from doing 1-3 months of depo Lupron?  </p>

I'm 38 years old with one ovary and one tube (that's blocked), and stage 3 endo that I had lap surgery for 5 weeks ago. I was supposed to start IVF this month, but...

I had a Sonohystagram 3 days ago and my RE found a random band of scar tissue in my uterus. I've never been pregnant or had surgery on my uterus. As mentioned above, I do have endometriosis (most of which was cleared as much as possible 5 weeks ago), I had my right ovary and tube removed at 17 years old due to an enormous cyst, I had an HSG last year, and a hysteroscopy during my recent lap surgery, but that's it. I should mention during last year's HSG they didn't see anything abnormal and my tube was open. During my surgery 5 weeks ago, they tried the dye in my tube again and it was now blocked.

The strange thing is, the surgeon (not my RE) never mentioned he found anything in my uterus from the hysteroscopy during my surgery a few weeks ago. Could the scar tissue be from that most recent surgery/hysteroscopy? Can scar tissue actually form that fast, or could they just have missed it? If I had scar tissue in there from endo or a missed infection it is surprising he didn't see it... my RE was like ""wtf??."" Seems odd that this scar tissue has magically shown up. Whatever the case, it's pretty upsetting as this will hinder our IVF plans. My RE is going to do a hysteroscopy himself and cut the tissue.

I've always had regular periods, 5-6 days (24-26 day cycles), and because of the endometriosis, I can't tell which symptoms may go with what. My periods weren't always painful, I would have an occasional heavy or painful period, but they weren't the norm. I also have a bit of IBS, so I would have cramps throughout my cycle at times muddying the waters.

I feel very defeated and want to know how to best approach next steps with my RE. I have read that estrogen and balloon therapy seems to work... Since January I have had one complication after another (including a very painful endometrioma which almost cost me my only ovary)... we were devastated to find out my only tube was blocked and due to all the other factors IVF was our best chance. Financially it will be very hard. Now with this seemingly unexplained scar tissue, it feels like my body is just saying ""no.""

Before the scar tissue was discovered, our odds of IVF success were given as 30% (ugh). Now I feel like this new complication lessens that even further. I almost don't even want to bother doing IVF now (like, is it worth the emotional, physical and financial struggle for such a low chance?), but feel like I can't give up for my partner's sake.

Hemochromatosis is a genetic mutation that means that a person stores too much iron in their body, and that excess iron is stored in your organs: [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemochromatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351443](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemochromatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351443)  It tends to impact people with northern and western European ancestry : [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/the-iron-in-our-blood-that-keeps-and-kills-us/266936/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/the-iron-in-our-blood-that-keeps-and-kills-us/266936/) Iron overload may cause infertility issues because one place the iron can be deposited is in the pituitary or the gonads, which can lead to hypogonadism: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1112815/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1112815/)  I couldn't find a lot of studies about hemochromatosis specifically and fertility issues; I did find a number of articles talking about fertility issues for persons who had iron overload for other reasons, such as iron overload due to numerous blood transfusions:  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27335221/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27335221/)The Iron Disorders Institute lists infertility as a possible condition: [https://www.hemochromatosis.org/welcome-2#overview](https://www.hemochromatosis.org/welcome-2#overview)

A few other things to mention:  There were a number of articles -- more, in fact -- about hemochromatosis and infertility for men.  I didn't read these as much but wanted to provide a link to a study that attempts to summarize the research: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501943/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501943/)  Another thing to note is that I saw references to other iron overload disorders but didn't research those, so iron overload is not exclusive to hemochromatosis. Also, a disclaimer -- the last time I took a science class was about 20 years ago, so this is me working with some dated information.   


If you think you might have this, it's helpful to ask for the iron panel blood test, not just the iron blood test: [https://www.hemochromatosis.org/#diagnosis](https://www.hemochromatosis.org/#diagnosis)  If those numbers come back high then you can move onto genetic testing (or at least that was my experience).   I don't think we're allowed to endorse specific companies on this sub; there are companies out there that will do an at-home iron panel.    


I have wondered why none of my REs or ObGyns ever issue spotted this for me.  I'm guessing it's because women tend to develop symptoms of iron overload in hemochromatosis later in life than men: if women are having periods, then they are losing blood, and losing blood through a phlebotomy is one of the main treatments for hemochromatosis.  (Once blood is removed, then your body has to pull some of the stored  iron from the organs to make more red blood cells.)

<p>Hemochromatosis is a genetic mutation that means that a person stores too much iron in their body, and that excess iron is stored in your organs: <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemochromatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351443"">https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemochromatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351443</a>  It tends to impact people with northern and western European ancestry : <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/the-iron-in-our-blood-that-keeps-and-kills-us/266936/"">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/the-iron-in-our-blood-that-keeps-and-kills-us/266936/</a> Iron overload may cause infertility issues because one place the iron can be deposited is in the pituitary or the gonads, which can lead to hypogonadism: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1112815/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1112815/</a>  I couldn&#39;t find a lot of studies about hemochromatosis specifically and fertility issues; I did find a number of articles talking about fertility issues for persons who had iron overload for other reasons, such as iron overload due to numerous blood transfusions:  <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27335221/"">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27335221/</a>The Iron Disorders Institute lists infertility as a possible condition: <a href=""https://www.hemochromatosis.org/welcome-2#overview"">https://www.hemochromatosis.org/welcome-2#overview</a></p>

<p>A few other things to mention:  There were a number of articles -- more, in fact -- about hemochromatosis and infertility for men.  I didn&#39;t read these as much but wanted to provide a link to a study that attempts to summarize the research: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501943/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501943/</a>  Another thing to note is that I saw references to other iron overload disorders but didn&#39;t research those, so iron overload is not exclusive to hemochromatosis. Also, a disclaimer -- the last time I took a science class was about 20 years ago, so this is me working with some dated information.   </p>

<p>If you think you might have this, it&#39;s helpful to ask for the iron panel blood test, not just the iron blood test: <a href=""https://www.hemochromatosis.org/#diagnosis"">https://www.hemochromatosis.org/#diagnosis</a>  If those numbers come back high then you can move onto genetic testing (or at least that was my experience).   I don&#39;t think we&#39;re allowed to endorse specific companies on this sub; there are companies out there that will do an at-home iron panel.    </p>

<p>I have wondered why none of my REs or ObGyns ever issue spotted this for me.  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s because women tend to develop symptoms of iron overload in hemochromatosis later in life than men: if women are having periods, then they are losing blood, and losing blood through a phlebotomy is one of the main treatments for hemochromatosis.  (Once blood is removed, then your body has to pull some of the stored  iron from the organs to make more red blood cells.)    I felt like one of the more frustrating parts of infertility is spending tons of time and money at doctors&#39; offices, and still feeling like you have to DIY it.  I hope that this helps someone else with their DIY-ing.</p>

I'm hitting a real anger and bitterness stage in my fertility journey and I'm really struggling to deal with my brother's partner complaining about how hard it is dealing with two young children. I really had to bite my tongue but then I have all this anger building up. 

It's strange how some people evoke a real reaction from me but others I can happily chat to about their babies and pregnancy etc. 

I'm also finding myself getting so angry at other people's pregnancy announcements etc. I'm too scared to go to a family gathering coming up with my husband's family for fear that my sister in law may announce a pregnancy and I'd have to react in real time. I really hate myself for feeling so angry and bitter. I think I'm usually a compassionate and patient person (one of the reasons that I've always been told I'd make a great parent!), seems like I'm actually rather shitty. I want to be a better person and be compassionate to other people's life challenges and joys. Any tips, advice or encouragement for dealing with this? Thanks for reading.

UPDATE Jan 2021 : For anyone finding this, I'd also like to add that my very supportive brother explained his take on this. I have so much anger about my situation but as it's no ones fault it is hard not to have a target for such anger. So when a trigger comes up it's so easy for that person who just got pregnant easily to be the target. So my SIL actually did just announce her pregnancy, something that I have been fearing. My anger is targeted at her, and even on my MIL when I think of how happy she must be! So I think this theory really makes sense to me. 

I've also realised that it isn't personal, it's just that whoever happens to get pregnant around you triggers a deep pain in you. It's like your deepest pain that you work hard to heal is ripped open all fresh again and you have to manage all those intense feelings. So triggers are powerfully painful to deal with. 

Things that have helped me along the way are: 

1) Being reminded that it is OK to feel like this. Of course I feel like this! Anyone would, I'm not a bad person for it.

2) Going through life with ease does not help you become a more compassionate person. To feel pain means you understand the pain in others. I'm grateful that I can understand and offer support to others when I feel strong enough (not always!).

Follow up with our RE (we had a different one for round 1) is Friday morning. I want to have suggestions for the next protocol based on what's given people here good blastocyst outcomes. Here's my history:

**IVF #1:** BCP priming, 14 days. I was on dexamethasone and levothyroxine, Gonal-F 300, Menopur 150. Cetrotide was added in later, I stimmed for 13 days and had a duel trigger with Lupron and HCG 10,000. I had 11 follicles, 6 eggs retrieved, 5 were mature, and 4 fertilized. They looked great day 3, but  only 1 made it to hatching blast, and was frozen. the FET did not take. 

**IVF #2:** Accidental 3 months of BCP because of COVID. :/ Then my next CD1 they monitored me for my ovulation, and had me start 20 units of microdose Lupron on 7DPO. I started stims on my next CD3. My antral follicle count was 0 and 1 respectively, I 1000% thought they would cancel my cycle, but they said this was 'normal' for lupron priming. I only really got 6 good looking follicles and still stimmed for 13 days. Though on day 13 they had me take my stims mid-day AND then do my trigger shot in the evening, again 10,000 HCG. 4 eggs, all immature. No embryos at all. 

We were supposed to add magnetic beads to separate sperm for a DNA frag issue we were unaware of in cycle #1, which is what we hoped was the reason why my embryos were arresting around day 5. But we didn't really get to see if this was the case.

If this happened to you, what would you ask? I really think the Lupron over suppressed me and led to the immaturity issue, as I did not have an issue with my eggs maturing in the first round. We're so crushed and disappointed, and we really trusted this RE. I still do, but I don't think clinics really compensate you if they fuck up your protocol. 

Things I might suggest:

\- no BCP priming  
\- no Lupron  
\- HGH  
\- Mini IVF?

292,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone, I'm having a debate about whether to move forward with second (and final) transfer this month.  A little history, we have secondary infertility due to chromosomal issues and decided to do IVF for this reason.  Also came to find out I have extreme DOR and egg quality issues.  #thisis38 

We were fortunate to get two genetically perfect embryos.  We transferred the first in May and no dice.  Dr. could not say why it didn't work.  Basically we have ruled out any uterus issue - had some scar tissue after D&C which was removed, did a second hysteroscopy after failed transfer to confirm no additional scarring, and we did a mock biopsy last cycle which confirmed no infection.  The mock also revealed that we were 3-4 days ""early"" on the transfer, so my doctor modified my medicine and timing accordingly for this transfer cycle.

One issue throughout the three medicated cycles has been a thinner lining.  It has never reached 7mm.  My Dr. did not think it was an issue because my pattern was perfect and that's why we went forward with first transfer.  During the mock my lining got a little thicker, at 6.6, with increased estrogen.  This cycle we added even more estrogen, by including patches, and my estrogen for whatever reason was not quite as high (but still fine) and my lining is only 5.4.  We had a little hiccup with the patches not sticking due to swimming (nobody told me not to swim! 🤦🏼‍♀️), Which caused my estrogen to start falling, but we got it back up.  

I thought this might result in a cancellation but my Dr. is still willing to move forward.  He left it up to me to decide, I can always choose to do another mock.  So now I'm left vacillating between going for it and doing a mock and then taking a month off.  I feel like there's nothing wrong with my uterus and the issue was timing which we now know and have adjusted for.  My lining is a nagging thing that makes me wonder.  But I am pretty much convinced it is what it is (we have literally thrown everything at my lining - more estrogen, Viagra, accupuncture, high protein diet, regular exercise, plenty of water).  Also we know from reviewing my history of scans that my lining never gets all that thick.

A little history, we have secondary infertility due to chromosomal issues and decided to do IVF for this reason.  Also came to find out I have extreme DOR and egg quality issues.  #thisis38 </p>

<p>We were fortunate to get two genetically perfect embryos.  We transferred the first in May and no dice.  Dr. could not say why it didn&#39;t work.  Basically we have ruled out any uterus issue - had some scar tissue after D&amp;C which was removed, did a second hysteroscopy after failed transfer to confirm no additional scarring, and we did a mock biopsy last cycle which confirmed no infection.  The mock also revealed that we were 3-4 days &quot;early&quot; on the transfer, so my doctor modified my medicine and timing accordingly for this transfer cycle.</p>

<p>One issue throughout the three medicated cycles has been a thinner lining.  It has never reached 7mm.  My Dr. did not think it was an issue because my pattern was perfect and that&#39;s why we went forward with first transfer.  During the mock my lining got a little thicker, at 6.6, with increased estrogen.  This cycle we added even more estrogen, by including patches, and my estrogen for whatever reason was not quite as high (but still fine) and my lining is only 5.4.  We had a little hiccup with the patches not sticking due to swimming (nobody told me not to swim! 🤦🏼‍♀️), Which caused my estrogen to start falling, but we got it back up.  </p>

<p>I thought this might result in a cancellation but my Dr. is still willing to move forward.  He left it up to me to decide, I can always choose to do another mock.  So now I&#39;m left vacillating between going for it and doing a mock and then taking a month off.  I feel like there&#39;s nothing wrong with my uterus and the issue was timing which we now know and have adjusted for.  My lining is a nagging thing that makes me wonder.  But I am pretty much convinced it is what it is (we have literally thrown everything at my lining - more estrogen, Viagra, accupuncture, high protein diet, regular exercise, plenty of water).  Also we know from reviewing my history of scans that my lining never gets all that thick.  </p>

<p>So I&#39;m just wondering what you all think as far as going for it or waiting.  Please don&#39;t say &quot;my Dr says lining has to be 10mm&quot; because my lining ain&#39;t never gonna be that.  Thank you for reading and for any support/insight you can offer.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your thoughts/comments!  I asked my RE to do one more scan before deciding and my lining was 7mm!  So we are going forward on 8/14.  I&#39;m feeling very excited and hopeful.</p>
