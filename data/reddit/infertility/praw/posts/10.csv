10,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My wife and I have been trying roughly ~2 years. My wife graduated school roughly a year ago, and the last six months we've been undergoing various infertility treatments. When we initially went in to get checked, we found out she wasn't ovulating and had PCOS.

The first round of treatment to correct the PCOS did nothing but make my wife incredibly sick. Her energy was non existent, she had immediate problems with rapid swelling and weight gain. At the end of that cycle, the PCOS hadn't budged. Next was a round of birth control to get her cycle under control(which sent her nearly suicidal with depression), five days of chlomid(wild mood swings) and the plan was to do the trigger shot to guarantee ovulation and IUI. We went in for the ultrasound and to get the shot, but the ultrasound showed a haemorrhagic cyst, which we mistook for her having already ovulated. Two days later, blood work showed it was a false trigger and we missed our shot that month.

Back to birth control to get her cycle on track, but we had to cut it short to two weeks because the side effects were too severe. Chlomid and ultrasound went well, IUI went well, then 12 days of progesterone which rendered my wife unable to function due to nasua and depression. Then her period, and a negative pregnancy test. 
At this point, my wife has been cripplingly sick for nearly six months. She says she doesn't remember what it's like to be healthy any more. Through all the blood and tears, she has always been willing to do it and go through it if it means children. Right now, we're struggling with the idea that it was all for nothing, months of almost literal torture for nothing. You know that scene in Harry Potter, where dumbledor has to drink the cursed water in the cave to get the horcrux? Where he made Harry promise that no matter how much he begged to stop, he had to make him go through it? That's how I felt every night getting the birth control and chlomid for my wife. It tore my heart to pieces.

My wife graduated school roughly a year ago, and the last six months we&#39;ve been undergoing various infertility treatments. When we initially went in to get checked, we found out she wasn&#39;t ovulating and had PCOS.</p>

<p>The first round of treatment to correct the PCOS did nothing but make my wife incredibly sick. Her energy was non existent, she had immediate problems with rapid swelling and weight gain. At the end of that cycle, the PCOS hadn&#39;t budged. Next was a round of birth control to get her cycle under control(which sent her nearly suicidal with depression), five days of chlomid(wild mood swings) and the plan was to do the trigger shot to guarantee ovulation and IUI. We went in for the ultrasound and to get the shot, but the ultrasound showed a haemorrhagic cyst, which we mistook for her having already ovulated. Two days later, blood work showed it was a false trigger and we missed our shot that month.</p>

<p>Back to birth control to get her cycle on track, but we had to cut it short to two weeks because the side effects were too severe. Chlomid and ultrasound went well, IUI went well, then 12 days of progesterone which rendered my wife unable to function due to nasua and depression. Then her period, and a negative pregnancy test. 
At this point, my wife has been cripplingly sick for nearly six months. She says she doesn&#39;t remember what it&#39;s like to be healthy any more. Through all the blood and tears, she has always been willing to do it and go through it if it means children. Right now, we&#39;re struggling with the idea that it was all for nothing, months of almost literal torture for nothing. You know that scene in Harry Potter, where dumbledor has to drink the cursed water in the cave to get the horcrux? Where he made Harry promise that no matter how much he begged to stop, he had to make him go through it? That&#39;s how I felt every night getting the birth control and chlomid for my wife. It tore my heart to pieces. </p>

Narrative
HYSTEROSALPINGOGRAM PERFORMED BY RADIOLOGIST
8/13/2015 8:31 AM

INDICATION: Infertility.
COMPARISON: None.

PROCEDURE: Procedure and risks explained and consent received. Using sterile technique, a hysterosalpingogram catheter was placed into the cervix and 10 mL Omni 300 contrast material was injected into the uterus and fallopian tubes under direct 
fluoroscopic supervision. Routine images obtained. 
FLUOROSCOPIC TIME: 1.3 minutes

COMPLICATIONS: None.

FINDINGS:
Congenital anomaly of the uterus which is best described as a left-sided unicornuate uterine cavity with a right-sided rudimentary horn; the rudimentary horn does communicate with the initial cavity. There is early and prominent extravasation of contrast
into the myometrium along the left side. The extravasation is so rapid and extensive that it was difficult to fill and visualize the fallopian tubes due to the overlying lymphatic and possible vascular opacification.

From the rudimentary horn there is a normal-appearing right intramural and isthmic portion of the fallopian tube and likely a normal-appearing ampullary portion. However, neither the fimbrial portion nor free spillage could not be documented.
From the left side there is transient visualization of the intramural portion and perhaps a slight amount of contrast within the the isthmic portion of the fallopian tube but the more distal fimbrial and ampullary portion were not visualized. Again, 
uncertain if the lack of opacification of the distal tubes relates to tubal obstruction or simply due to the preferential extravasation of the contrast through the left-sided myometrium.

Impression
CONCLUSION:
1. Congenital anomaly best described as a left-sided unicornuate with a communicating right-sided rudimentary horn.
2. Very prominent early and rapid extravasation of contrast through the left uterine sidewall hinders opacification and visualization of the fallopian tubes.
3. Parts of each fallopian tube are identified and appear normal though the distal aspects and free spillage could not be identified on either side.
4. MRI may be beneficial to further evaluate endometrial cavity and uterine shape.

History: PCOS with anovulation and low end of normal quantity sperm; did 3 IUIs on femara, 1 off cycle with HSG, 1 cycle of femara self-timed but DID ovulate on my own!!

We are going to add gonal-F to the femara and see how that helps. My first question is, I had an U/S on day 2 and there was a good sized follicle there that the doc remarked as normal, but shouldn't that have gone when I ovulated? I didn't catch a size or anything.

Second question, did anyone have issues anything on gonal-F? I didn't have bad symptoms on femara, other than general bloaty-ness and feeling like I needed to poo all the time!

A general note for everyone: with this protocol, my Dr has me going through a particular pharmacy (my insurance wont pay) which varies month to month  based upon what deals they can get. This month it is gonal-F, and I signed up for compassionate care discount, and got 25% off! Even better, this is off the ovidrel too! The first 3 cycles I went through my pharmacy and paid $145/shot, with this place they normally only charge $90-something, with my discount I only pay $74/shot! Wish I had known this before!!


EDIT to answer some questions: 
The pharmacy is SMP Fertility out of Miami Florida. My doc sent them the script and they called me, and the meds will be over-nighted via fedex. http://smpfertility.com/
The discount came from the drug manufacturer for gonal-f/ovidrel: https://fertilitylifelines.com/?q=fertility-support/saving-fertility-treatments (click on the self-pay, not insurance if you have insurance but it doesnt pay for drugs).

But so were stepping it up & doing IUI now and the doctor said in the 2ww not to get too hot.. in regards to exercising. So now I have been thinking, ok, no crazy cardio during 2ww. I'll try taking it a little easier.. and have only been doing videos a couple times a week, light/nothing during 2ww & nothing during ovulation.

I told her I was worried I wouldn't be able to do it & so she wants to practice hiking with me on some tougher hikes. I hattttee to be paranoid (buttt I am. I had a yard sale this morning and was worried about the heat because I just ovulated & feel heat sick now, hah). 

The what if game sucks so much. But is there any chance over exertion can cause issue in the 2ww?

Ive read all the usual.. if your body is used to it, it's ok. But technically I wouldn't be use to hiking as much as I will be and it will definitely be somewhat of a toll on me.

35,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"MFI, TTC three years, doing our 2nd round of IVF, and I’m in the middle of my stim cycle (RIGHT NOW!) with egg retrieval scheduled for next week. 

We went to our first support group meeting this week and 2 couples shared stories about “simple procedures” that could have been done up front for them, but weren’t. Later these couples realized a polyp or varicocele (both easily fixed) were the cause of their infertility all along.

These stories got my husband (who is a physician) wondering if we had left any stones unturned in our own journey. He started to fixate on the fact that he’s suspected a varicocele for the past however-many-years, but has never had a scrotal u/s. In fact, the first urologist we saw claimed to have found nothing in my husband’s physical exam 1.5 years ago, and denied my husband the scrotal ultrasound… even after my husband requested it… twice.

Yesterday, one of my husbands professional colleagues (we’ll call him “second opinion” urologist) not only found a varicocele in his physical exam, but a glaring bilateral varicocele in the ultrasound. WTF.

I was in the u/s room when they found it and I started sobbing. Seriously, after all we’ve been through in the last year and a half, and to know that there was something we missed in the beginning. WOW.

So my husband decided that he wants to have the varicocele fixed, go on Clomid, and see if it helps before we move on to more FETs. I am in agreement. We are fully aware the chances of his repair changing our situation are VERY slim. We know this. And yet, we feel like we need to KNOW for sure. If we continued to have more failed FETs… which as many of you know are emotionally excruciating… we would kick ourselves for not doing everything we could. Go for the “low-hanging fruit,” as they say.

So we informed my current RE that we’d like to continue my current stim cycle (because jeesh, I’m half-way through it) and simply freeze my eggs. OMG, you’d think that I had asked to attempt to conceive naturally by f#$king in their office for good luck. The skepticism and negativity I was met with when requesting to FREEZE MY EGGS has been… unexpected.

“You will lose some when you thaw.” 
“Fertilization is harder with thawed eggs.”
“You’ll have a better outcome with fresh eggs.”
“The odds of any embryos making it to blastocyst stage is reduced with thawed eggs.”
“You may not be able to do PGS if you use thawed eggs.”
“You really should just fertilize these eggs and have them tested now.”
“There’s no reason not to fertilize these eggs.”
“This is going to set you back 6 months or more.”

And on, and on.

Here are our reasons for freezing the eggs (which I told to the Dr):

1. Research we’ve found indicates men with repaired varicocele (varicocelectomy) experience higher rates of clinical pregnancy and lower rates of miscarriage. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727535

2. Research we’ve found indicates there is a strong association between genetic defects and varicocele-related infertility in men. We want my husband to be genetically tested before moving forward with fertilization. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583153/  (Hello! 3 failed FETs here!… with “normal” embryos!”)

3. IT’S WHAT WE FEEL IS RIGHT.  

The doctor is still trying to talk us into fertilizing next week’s eggs. We won’t do it though. There’s basically nothing he can say to us that will make us change out minds. (Edit: Ok... After reading comments and continuing my own research, I think this was an overstatement. We could change our minds yet...)

Sadly, I can’t help but feel that this doc is REALLY pushing this for his own financial gain. Maybe I’ve been burned before and have trust issues this time (this is our 2nd RE) but damn. My gut is telling me to move on and find a 3rd RE. What do you all think?

Just wanted to share. Interested to hear if any of you have been in the same boat.

TL;DR I’m mid-stim, and husband just found varicocele after 3yrs TTC, 1 round IVF, and 3 failed FETs. Doctor trying to tell us the varicocele doesn’t matter and to fertilize the eggs now instead of waiting for the slight chance of better sperm in 6 months.

Edit: We decided tonight (thanks to continued research and the helpful advice of everyone in this thread) that we are going to continue this stim cycle, fertilize the eggs, and do PGS. After hearing everyone's opinions here, I do feel better about the advice given to us by our RE... I feel like he at least wasn't giving us a line of bulls$%^. The RE has always been confident that with our current stats/numbers they can get us pregnant with PGS. Hubs will still do the varicocelectomy and we'll re-evaluate his SA in about 6 months.

We agreed to start trying naturally in 2013 so the child will be born before we move back in 2015. We did the best we could with her job taking her to other parts of the world or making her work late at night. Over a year we tried, and got nothing. Me being a guy just shrugged my shoulders and accepted that it just hadn't happened. My wife on the other hand, was becoming worried. So she got blood test, and I got sperm counts. Turns out I have an extremely low sperm count (most likely cause by my previous work) and this didn't surprise me. So we looked for assistance. We found a doctor in the local area that all the American women swear by. We went in and were suggested IVF. We looked it over and decided to try it out. We went through the procedures of growing an embryo. The doctor took 6 eggs, and only 1 accepted my sperms chromosomes. So we used it. I had little faith that it would work, whereas my wife was very hopeful. Turns out I was right, and the embryo never buried. We were rightfully upset. A few months later and a few thousand dollars later we are ready for round 2. The doctor pulls 5 eggs and 4 grew nicely. We inserted 2. A few weeks later we went in for our first ultrasound and we see 2 little dots (his ultrasound wasn't the best quality). We were very very happy. And time goes and we are told to get an ultrasound every week. So we did. The next ultrasound showed 3 dots... I was surprised, we were going to have triplets! The next week it was 2 dots, and then 3 again. Week 10 comes and we have 3 healthy little fetuses. At the end of week 10 I move back to the states to set up the house and get ready for my wife to move here. Week 11 comes around, and there was no more heart beat. My wife was historical and couldn't stop crying. I'm half way around the world, alone in a new place. So I do what I do best, I repress it.

I think I read something about having a coffee right before can help the sperms motility? But the only study I can find says that it was men who drank coffee everyday, anyone know or try this before an analysis? My husband normally doesn't drink coffee at all, just iced tea.

So our experience with analysis' for him have been ""pretty low"", ""average/a lot higher than it was last"", & now for our iuis, he's only getting around 3-5mil post wash. Today it was 3.6 and 2 motility (they like 3-4) The doctor pretty much said we probably have to do IVF/chances are really low. I've read the statistics & also searched the internet for success stories. 

I thought I would be okay doing multiple rounds of IUI because it's all our insurance covers, but now I'm not so positive..if we're just wasting our time & money. Although the money is way less than IVF, I hate to feel like were wasting it. And just what I'm putting my body & emotions through.

Anyway, I'm trying to be positive, & think we should try this at least a couple more times & be really proactive to increase our chances for this or future cycles. 

My husband takes fertilaid, count boost, & motility boost. Does anyone think its better to take supplements separately instead of these ones that are put together for you? Or add additional supplements on top?

Also, he's been diagnosed with varicocele. It's not that noticeable so we're not sure if that is the problem or not. He also has a benign growth in his testicle. Were going to get another opinion with a urologist, but I'm wondering anyone's experience with this & the surgery for it?

I know all the usual tips & he's pretty healthy, although he works/commutes/doesn't always get the most sleep/is stressed pretty often. But has anything worked for you?

My name is Mya and my husband and I are gearing up for IVF next month.  I never thought I would be going down this path as I am sure many of you can relate.

I wanted to see if I could gain some insight from any of you - from reading many of these posts it seems so many of you are very educated on the process and medications.  None of this makes sense to me despite my reading!

To give you some background I am 39 years old my husband is 35.  I have had some basic fertility tests and some of the numbers have me confused.  My AMH is .76 my FSH is 8.1 and my AFC is 25.  The doctor said my bloodwork numbers are slightly better than someone my age but the AMH is a bit low.  The AFC he said was an amazing number and he had not seen that type of number in his clinic.  I asked if one of these was inaccurate and he said he thought the ultrasound although in another forum a doctor responded they thought the AMH should be retested.  Has anyone seen a case where someone has great AFC but low AMH?  It's all starting to do my head in and I haven't even started treatment.  I am afraid I am in DOR because of the AMH but then I am scared that I may overstimulate if I have that AFC!!  Of course I need to be the odd one out.  

Another concern I have is the hormone medication.  I am very sensitive to hormones.  In fact when I was in my 20's I had to stop taking birth control pills only after a month because it raised my blood pressure.  High blood pressure runs in my family.  My doctor gave me my protocol information (not sure this will be the exact protocol/medications) and he is putting me on the Antagonist -Vivelle Protocol without Birth Control Pills.  Sounds like I wear a Vivelle patch prior to stimulating.  Looks like from what I researched my dosages will be low.  75 IU FSH and LH.  Does anyone know or have experience with this protocol?  Does this seem mild or aggressive?  Sorry I sound like a maniac.  I am beyond scared.  Scared of the effects, scared it won't work but mainly scared I am doing the right thing.

I've struggled for most of my adult life with irregular periods, and bouts of hypothalamic amenorrhea. Mostly due to intense exercising and low body fat. I've recently (within the past 6 months) managed to regain my period after cutting out intense exercise and eating more fat and I thought I was on the road to TTC. My cycles are about 40/41 days long. We are 5 months away from TTC - so I went to my OBGYN yesterday for a preconception appointment - after exams and a transvaginal ultrasound she told me that it seems very unlikely that I ovulate at all. I'm doing the CD3 blood test as soon as my next period comes, but I know from previous blood work results that I do not have PCOS. I'm pretty confident that my inability to ovulate is a result of stress/low body fat. I struggle with this because I am already eating to the point of feeling uncomfortable most of the time, and I don't see how I can eat MORE to put on additional weight. Doing my very best, but I feel like I'm going to need to start on fertility treatments when the time comes - which may now be sooner rather than later after learning all of this.
Can anyone relate to this? What are the success rates for fertility treatments (Clomid, IUI) on someone that has a period, but is on the lower end of the body fat scale. My BMI is healthy and in the normal range (20).

<p>I&#39;ve struggled for most of my adult life with irregular periods, and bouts of hypothalamic amenorrhea. Mostly due to intense exercising and low body fat. I&#39;ve recently (within the past 6 months) managed to regain my period after cutting out intense exercise and eating more fat and I thought I was on the road to TTC. My cycles are about 40/41 days long. We are 5 months away from TTC - so I went to my OBGYN yesterday for a preconception appointment - after exams and a transvaginal ultrasound she told me that it seems very unlikely that I ovulate at all. I&#39;m doing the CD3 blood test as soon as my next period comes, but I know from previous blood work results that I do not have PCOS. I&#39;m pretty confident that my inability to ovulate is a result of stress/low body fat. I struggle with this because I am already eating to the point of feeling uncomfortable most of the time, and I don&#39;t see how I can eat MORE to put on additional weight. Doing my very best, but I feel like I&#39;m going to need to start on fertility treatments when the time comes - which may now be sooner rather than later after learning all of this.

67,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"This is the first time I am joining and posting on a forum. I’ve reached the point of needing to vent and seek people’s advice in regards to Unexplained Infertility. It’s become so overwhelming and depressing for me and would really appreciate other people sharing their experience and knowledge.  My husband and I have chosen to be private in regards to this matter. None of our family members or friends know we are going through this. 

My husband and I have been trying to conceive for a year and 8 months now.  Just to give a background, I stopped taking birth control pills October 2013 since we were hoping 2014 would be the year we will start having kids. I was an avid runner before then so my PCP recommended for me to cut down on it. Half of 2014, we went to see my OBGYN to consult in regards to us not being pregnant yet after 6 months of trying. Pretty much we were told that it might just take time and usually they don’t refer couples to fertility doctors until after more than a year of trying.  We saw my OB GYN again a few months after that that time they ran blood test on me and sperm test for my husband. Most of the results were normal so my doctor ordered HSG for me. Before the end of 2014, I ended up having HSG done and test result is normal. I was very optimistic that perhaps after that test, I might get pregnant since I read somewhere it can help (HSG pretty much cleans out the pipes). We also saw the Urologist to check with my husband since his test results showed 1% sperm morphology (his previous result was 9%)—The urologist told us not to worry since this test result is pretty much subjective and even if it were true, my husband has a very high sperm count (they are strong ones too). The Urologist even said a good percentage of men who have kids probably have 1% sperm morphology but they don’t know it since they haven’t had sperm test (no need due to having kids already). Anyhow, we were finally recommended to a Fertility specialist /RE. We started the process with the fertility clinic around February this year. All of our blood work is normal/outstanding. 

We started our first round of IUI with them March. This fertility clinic has multiple practicing fertility doctors. Our doctor, Dr. A is nice but for our first round baseline ultrasound he wasn’t available so I ended up seeing Dr. B, this doctor cut my original Clomid dosage to half (Dr. A has placed 100 mg clomid) since she thought it would be best just in case I encounter side effects. To make story short, out of all the 12 follicles I had, only one matured. I ended up seeing another doctor in the practice, Dr. C. Anyhow, for IUI I had another doctor Dr. D. Obviously that try was a failure, I didn’t get pregnant. I was really disappointed since my older sister took clomid and got pregnant with my nephew 10 years ago so I thought this would help me as well. 

For the 2nd month of fertility treatment, my clomid prescription was brought up to 100 mg. On my baseline ultrasound for this cycle, I didn’t like how Dr. A wasn’t as descriptive like Dr. B. I asked him how many follicles and he said “Oh I didn’t count but it’s not more than 10”—I told him Dr. B told me I had 6 follicles on the left and right previous cycle. Somehow my this clinic goofed up on my prescription since my pharmacy said they have placed 150mg for me to take per day even though the doctor said 100mg to me. After calling my doctor for a few times, it finally got cleared and I was able to get the medication. Anyhow, I responded well and ended up having 2 mature eggs but the downside is that my lining is thin. I asked Dr. A if there is anything we can do to increase my lining but he said there’s nothing. I decided to skip IUI on this cycle since my lining is thin: even if I had fertilized eggs, it won’t implant and from the previous cycle, it cost about $2600 last month. My insurance only covers certain amount for fertility so I wanted to save that when we have better chances. Dr. A mentioned about perhaps trying Letrozole next cycle if unsucessful this time around.

Come 3rd month, Dr. A most likely forgot about Letrozole so he said we’ll continue with Clomid 100mg since I had responded well with 2 eggs maturing and released since I took a trigger shot. My pharmacy had issues again with them, this time they didn’t renew the prescription or whatever.  I made a few calls and emailed my doctor for it to be resolved. For the ultrasound before I ovulate, I had Dr. B since Dr. A is away. Dr. B saw my lining is thin again so she ended up giving me Estradiol (estrogen). I was pissed with Dr. A since I asked him last month if there’s anything I can take to thicken my lining and he said nothing yet Dr. B gave me something to help with it. I took 4mg of this daily intravaginally. I think I took this for about 10-12 days as per what she suggested. Still no luck even though I thought that would help. I skipped on IUI for this month since I was out of town when I ovulated. I was on vacation and thought stress relief will help us conceive. 

4th month, I was placed on Letrozole. I found out too that previous month I had released 2 eggs without the trigger shot. For my 2nd ultrasound this cycle, a polyp was seen in my Uterus. The doctor is not 100% sure of it and said sonohysterogram would be needed to confirm. I skipped IUI again because in that ultrasound I saw that stalk like alien thing in the middle of my Uterus. I know for sure implantation would fail. 

Last month, after I got my period, I started on BCP 3rd day of cycle. On my 11th day I had sonohysterogram with Dr. A. The M.A asked me if I took antibiotics that day and I responded with “uh you guys didn’t tell me to take anything and you guys haven’t sent a prescription to my pharmacy?” That point she realized their mistake and she was like oh yea we didn’t send anything; however you need to take one today, then she sent the prescription to my pharmacy.  My pharmacy caught another error on my fertility clinic’s behalf again surprise, surprise. They ordered for 1 antibiotic (tablet) with instructions take 2 a day. At this point my Pharmacy felt bad for me since my clinic/doctor (moreso probably his assistants) keeps messing up. Anyhow, Sonohysterogram confirmed the polyp. I asked Dr. A if he thinks that polyp has been there for a while or it’s a new sprout? He just responded with he can’t confirm. At this point, I’m thinking WTF…I need to find a new fertility doctor. In my previous ultra sounds (6-7 ultrasounds) that thing wasn’t there so I think me taking Estradiol has caused that uterine polyp (uterine polyps are caused by hormonal factors)? (Reflecting on last month on how I was pissed Dr. A for not giving me Estradiol to thicken my lining on 2nd month but I think he was onto something. I guess he didn’t want to risk this type of thing from happening)… Or was it there all along a smaller version one and it grew due to estrogen galore (HSG can’t detect this due to dye but saline/SHG could)? Is this the main reason of my infertility? I’m not really sure cos I’m not a doctor and sadly my fertility doctor can’t answer these questions.  The uterine polyp is moderate size as per Dr. A and it’s occupying the best prime real estate for implantation (Damn you Pedunculated Polyp!!!).  In this appointment too they mentioned if I plan on doing IVF…I said yes but in the back of my mind there is no damn way I would go with them after all the mishaps. I asked Dr. A a lot of questions on this appointment and also on my pre-OP. I think he is slowly figuring out I’m smarter than I look. 

I had my hysteroscopy done less than a week ago. I was anxious but excited because this would a.) remove the polyp b.) Dr. A would be able to see if there are other obstructions/polyps, etc in my uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and confirm endometriosis but due to the challenges I’ve had with the fertility clinic it makes me question if the doctor will be detailed enough or would it be just a rush job? My surgery went well I think. I specifically asked Dr. A to have a before and after photo (might as well since they are filming/taking photos in there for educational purposes). I’m supposed to see those next week for my post op appointment with Dr. E. Yes, another different doctor that is avail that day since Dr. A is on time off. Currently I’m in a state of mess. I didn’t get any bleeding the first few days after the surgery but brown spotting has started Friday and still continues today. Based on some forums I read it should be normal but my scumbag brain is worried with the biopsy results and I’m anxious for my post op appointment. I hope I will get the information I need so I can stop freaking out. Mid next week too I am expecting my period so I hope it does come so my husband and I can start TTC on our own (hopefully post-OP would bring some good news: no more polyps and can TTC soon). Sorry peeps I’m still not used to conceiving lingos/acronyms—only thing I know is TTC (Trying to conceive). 

This whole journey trying to get pregnant has been very difficult on me emotionally. Even though I try to be strong it’s really hard. The past year and 8 months, my sister who is 6 years my senior had a baby, my sis-in-law who also started trying the same time my husband and I were, already has a 6 month old baby and about 10+ of our friends recently had a baby and are pregnant. Don’t get me wrong I’m very happy for each of them but it rubs salt on my wounds. All of our friends and family always ask us when we are having ours and I always reply with our time will come, we will eventually have kids and laugh. This question started really stinging me a year ago and sometimes I just want to answer with I’m trying okay but it’s not working. Part of us keeping this a secret is because we don’t want people in our business, I don’t want people talking about how we should do it, etc (would be too weird coming from family in every events). Part of it is cos I don’t people speculating who is the defective one, my husband or me? I really thought conceiving would be easy. I have always been regular, we eat really healthy, live healthy, I’m still under 35, and we have no history of infertility in both of our families. I feel like a total fail every month I get my period. On top of this I’m overwhelmed with deciding on what we should do next. We have an appointment with a new fertility clinic this October but my first choice clinic; we are on their waiting list. Both of these clinics got good reviews but my first choice has better SART ratings and better IVF package cost. I really just want to make the most intelligent decision but doing all these things first time makes it challenging. Honestly, I feel like I should have been more outspoken with this current fertility clinic that I’ve been going to considering they have goofed up a lot of stuff. In reality they are a fertility clinic that sees a lot of patients and has different doctors in their practice with different approach to things. After going here, I know for sure I would want to just go to a fertility clinic where I can get a personalized treatment and not see multiple doctors who doesn’t even remember they met me before…If I’ll be spending all these money I might as well go to the better clinic. 

I hope this hysteroscopy solved my infertility issues and won’t even have to go through IVF but I’m so pessimistic and very logical so I don’t really think the polyp was my problem in the first place. I’m trying to take things one day at a time. Trying to read up about IVF so I can be more knowledgeable. There are just days I’m so depressed and hopeless. I’m so terrified going through IVF—fearing it will fail for us too. I know couple of people who’s tried this unsuccessfully. 

My hope is that by writing here, it will help me cope with things and learn from everyone…

Part of us keeping this a secret is because we don’t want people in our business, I don’t want people talking about how we should do it, etc (would be too weird coming from family in every events). Part of it is cos I don’t people speculating who is the defective one, my husband or me? I really thought conceiving would be easy. I have always been regular, we eat really healthy, live healthy, I’m still under 35, and we have no history of infertility in both of our families. I feel like a total fail every month I get my period. On top of this I’m overwhelmed with deciding on what we should do next. We have an appointment with a new fertility clinic this October but my first choice clinic; we are on their waiting list. Both of these clinics got good reviews but my first choice has better SART ratings and better IVF package cost. I really just want to make the most intelligent decision but doing all these things first time makes it challenging. Honestly, I feel like I should have been more outspoken with this current fertility clinic that I’ve been going to considering they have goofed up a lot of stuff. In reality they are a fertility clinic that sees a lot of patients and has different doctors in their practice with different approach to things. After going here, I know for sure I would want to just go to a fertility clinic where I can get a personalized treatment and not see multiple doctors who doesn’t even remember they met me before…If I’ll be spending all these money I might as well go to the better clinic. </p>

<p>I hope this hysteroscopy solved my infertility issues and won’t even have to go through IVF but I’m so pessimistic and very logical so I don’t really think the polyp was my problem in the first place. I’m trying to take things one day at a time. Trying to read up about IVF so I can be more knowledgeable. There are just days I’m so depressed and hopeless. I’m so terrified going through IVF—fearing it will fail for us too. I know couple of people who’s tried this unsuccessfully. </p>

<p>My hope is that by writing here, it will help me cope with things and learn from everyone…</p>

I'm very new to all this so please be gentle!

I am 27 years old. I have been with my husband for going on 6 years. 
I don't believe I've ever had a ""normal"" menstrual cycle. When I was 13 I had two on my own spaced months apart. Then nothing. At 16 I went on birth control and stayed on it until I was around 21. When I quit the birth control I quit having a period. 

So a couple months ago my husband and I decided it was about time to figure out what was going on.
So I scheduled an appointment. My doctor had some blood tests done(FSH, LH and a couple more). I apologize I don't have the numbers in front of me but the doctor said my results came back in the normal ranges. My husband had a sperm analysis and his result came back fine as well. The doctor also gave me provera to see if I would have a period, and I did.

On my most recent appointment the doctor gave me more 10mg provera as well as 50mg clomid. 
Yesterday was my 10th day of the provera. I'm supposed to take the clomid on day 5 of my period.

I am doing a basal temp chart and bought some ovulation tests as well.

So on to my questions.
Everything I read says that my first day of ""flow"" counts as cycle day 1. I am currently very lightly bleeding after having a couple days of spotting. Would today be considered my day 1?
The last time on provera I started spotting on July 2nd but then got a full flow on the 6th and that lasted until the 11th. There was no light bleeding like this last time.

Secondly the directions on my provera say to start taking another round two weeks from the start of my period. 
What if I ovulate and get pregnant this round? Will I be able to tell before the next round of provera? Will the provera hurt anything if I take it and I am pregnant?

Sry for the length of this! I'm just nervous I'm going to do something wrong!
Thanks in advance!

Husband shared this article with me...  

There are a few things that bother me about this article.  

1. The idea that IVF is so common place that no one mentions it because it's just so common.  

> Then there’s IVF – today, such a ‘normal’ medical procedure that people often don’t mention it.

No...  no IVF is not such a normal medical procedure that people don't mention it...  As far as I've been able to gather most people aren't mentioning it because they don't want people to judge them for using a controversial procedure.  (not to mention there was no mention of IUI - maybe the writer meant IUI?) I didn't like that the writer just brushed aside IVF like that ain't no thing...  Like the steps I see friends going through here are just...  every day easy...  I honestly feel like only doing Embryo Transfers gave me easy street in some way.  I don't stim...  I don't have discomfort from ovaries bursting..  I don't worry about OHSS...  I don't have to go through a surgical procedure to remove eggs.  

2. Writer describes surrogacy 

> Surrogacy, in which a woman outside the relationship carries the couple's embryo until birth, has also made it to the mainstream.... surrogates carried their babies, created from the couples’ own sperm and eggs.

I might be picky here...  I would have rather she mentioned Gestational Carrier...  

3. Donation vs Purchase :(

> Of course, the word ‘donor’ is just a euphemism in most places. The eggs are often purchased, except for those from the few family members who actually do donate their eggs.

umm...  I guess that is a matter of perspective and of course based on where you live.  I guess based on the clinic we decided, I don't have insight on donor fees or any of that stuff.  In a way whatever the agreement was between the donor and the clinic doesn't really involve me other than selecting the profile.  Is the Clinic then purchasing the eggs from the donor?  Well...  at least here we provide compensation for some donated things - plasma for example?  Believe me, if someone was purely altruistic and didn't want anything from me and wanted to cover whatever expenses she would have from donating and it was someone I felt good about selecting, I'd go with them no problem - but maybe it's the cynical side of me, but I honestly think if that was how this operated then I'd be fucked and likely begging family members...  I don't believe in true altruism.  

Those things aside..  I like that she brought up Diminished Ovarian Reserve.  I also like that she addressed the idea of Donor Egg being akin to adopting..  but then also points out parts that just differ from adoption which I think could be positive or negative depending.

<p>Husband shared this article with me...  </p>

<p>There are a few things that bother me about this article.  </p>

<ol>
<li>The idea that IVF is so common place that no one mentions it because it&#39;s just so common.<br/></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Then there’s IVF – today, such a ‘normal’ medical procedure that people often don’t mention it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No...  no IVF is not such a normal medical procedure that people don&#39;t mention it...  As far as I&#39;ve been able to gather most people aren&#39;t mentioning it because they don&#39;t want people to judge them for using a controversial procedure.  (not to mention there was no mention of IUI - maybe the writer meant IUI?) I didn&#39;t like that the writer just brushed aside IVF like that ain&#39;t no thing...  Like the steps I see friends going through here are just...  every day easy...  I honestly feel like only doing Embryo Transfers gave me easy street in some way.  I don&#39;t stim...  I don&#39;t have discomfort from ovaries bursting..  I don&#39;t worry about OHSS...  I don&#39;t have to go through a surgical procedure to remove eggs.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Writer describes surrogacy </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Surrogacy, in which a woman outside the relationship carries the couple&#39;s embryo until birth, has also made it to the mainstream.... surrogates carried their babies, created from the couples’ own sperm and eggs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I might be picky here...  I would have rather she mentioned Gestational Carrier...  </p>

<ol>
<li>Donation vs Purchase :(</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the word ‘donor’ is just a euphemism in most places. The eggs are often purchased, except for those from the few family members who actually do donate their eggs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>umm...  I guess that is a matter of perspective and of course based on where you live.  I guess based on the clinic we decided, I don&#39;t have insight on donor fees or any of that stuff.  In a way whatever the agreement was between the donor and the clinic doesn&#39;t really involve me other than selecting the profile.  Is the Clinic then purchasing the eggs from the donor?  Well...  at least here we provide compensation for some donated things - plasma for example?  Believe me, if someone was purely altruistic and didn&#39;t want anything from me and wanted to cover whatever expenses she would have from donating and it was someone I felt good about selecting, I&#39;d go with them no problem - but maybe it&#39;s the cynical side of me, but I honestly think if that was how this operated then I&#39;d be fucked and likely begging family members...  I don&#39;t believe in true altruism.  </p>

<p>Those things aside..  I like that she brought up Diminished Ovarian Reserve.  I also like that she addressed the idea of Donor Egg being akin to adopting..  but then also points out parts that just differ from adoption which I think could be positive or negative depending.  </p>

<p>I also liked the insight to the concept that Donor Eggs are just for aging women - and I&#39;m sure the percentage is up there that most women using Donor Eggs are up there in age.  Though I would argue that ANYONE undergoing any fertility treatment gets the whole why not adopt question.  </p>

He has a PICC line for at-home IV antibiotics for the next 2 weeks, but he's feeling so much better. 

I hadn't ovulated yet, after taking 75iu Bravelle CD 3-9, so I went in for a scan to check and see where I was at. 

You guys. I had ZERO response to the Bravelle. I had gone in on CD 3 and 8 to check follicle growth and both times they just saw lots of tiny follicles. Well, on CD 17, it was exactly the same. I'm really frustrated and disappointed. My RE said if we want to continue/and are able to try this cycle, I could start taking the Bravelle again and come back Monday, so that's what I'm doing.

Why isn't this working? Why isn't my body responding, nearly at all, to the meds??! This is our first injectible-only cycle and she's keeping me on the lowest dose, insisting that I ""don't want to deal with triplets or twins if I already have 2 at home."" To me that's super inappropriate. Talk to me about a the risks of a multiple pregnancy, not about how many kids I can or can't handle. I feel like she's dragging me along on the lowest dose of everything until I become resistant to the meds. That's what happened to my (13) cycles of Clomid and Femara. Last cycle was Femara + Bravelle and I had a very slow response to that as well.

I'm rambling now... but does anyone have any suggestions? I'l log in Monday to check and see where we're at after another 6 days of injects, but truthfully I'm not hopeful.

I'm a male - 33 years old. My wife (34) and I have been trying to get pregnant for about 2 years. I've had two SA's done and both came back abnormal. Count and motility were pretty good (a bit low, but manageable) but morphology was 0% the first time and 1% the second time. We did the full work-up of blood tests, scrotal ultrasound, etc. Everything came back normal. No issues, other than useless sperm. I go for a third SA in a couple of weeks with the fertility urologist, so he can see ""first hand"" what my sperm looks like. The numbers in the results say somewhere around 75% have issues in the head. 

Our fertility clinic has basically told us that IUI would pretty much be pointless due to my issues. My wife is, of course, super healthy. The issues are all with me.

Speaking of issues with me - I have moral issues with IVF. I'm not trying to preach or condemn anyone who's had success with it. More power to you, and I'm very happy for you. But, for me, I just don't know if I can look past the feelings in my gut about it. I don't know what effect it would have on me, my relationship with my wife, my relationship with my child (if it worked). I'm stuck feeling like I wouldn't be able to live with myself if we did it because I'd be going against a very deeply held belief - and that I wouldn't be able to live with myself if we didn't do it because I'd be letting my wife down. Our marriage counselor has basically said that my wife and I, as a team, need to agree on whatever ""stopping point"" is too far for either of us, so that neither of us is crossing a line that would be damaging to ourselves. But, my wife isn't buying it. I'm letting her down. 

On top of this, I've been really struggling with identity - as a man. I'm not sure how to put it into words, and so I hope that at least one other person reading this knows what I mean - but I feel like I'm not a man. There's no knowable reason why my sperm is bad, it just is. It's not a hormone deficiency, a bad blood vessel, or tight underwear. It's just a problem with my ability to perform my single biological imperative as a man. I can't shake this feeling. It's negatively affected so much in my life. I can't get aroused for sex anymore even when it's not an attempt at conceiving. (I had issues with that before, too, as the self- and wife- pressure made it damn near impossible to climax during those critical days. Which, too, made my wife feel like I was letting her down, and made me feel like less of a man.)

I apologize again. I know this has been really melodramatic. I just needed to get this off my chest. I needed to vent because I really don't feel comfortable talking with anyone about it.

I've sort of discovered this is what makes me stressed out the most.. because they're supposed to be on my side, and it feels like they just make it harder.

So they put a request through to insurance for follistim and think they aren't getting a response soon enough for my cycle, so want to put me on birth control. They say this is normal, googling I see it's common. But I really dont want to do it. It would delay my cycle and I could see it changing my cycle or something? 

I just don't want to take it. 

So we go back and forth and they sort of accept what I want to do, except then they still don't hear from insurance the next morning, so they call me and basically say go get your birth control.

I have the letrozole pills I need to start the IUI, but what they're worried about are the follistim injections not getting delivered in time for this cycle, so they want to basically delay me a week. A week is not a huge deal when youre dealing with month after month, but it's just another thing. And another monitoring appt Id have to drive pretty far to go to. 

So I called insurance that night before getting the bcp and they confirmed that it was now approved. Yay..perfect, now my nurse just needs to call the order in (she kept saying she was worried they wouldnt deliver in time) It would be called in Wed morning, plenty of time I think to get delivered by Saturday, especially because they have to do overnight delivery of injectibles.

She doesnt respond to my email on Wed. I should have called but I thought it was a no brainer. She always responds to my emails and I was out all day.

Thurs morning, this morning, I can tell shes frustrated with me for doing something they didn't want me to do (started the letrozole) and she still says it probably wont be delivered in time.

I call the delivery company because I also need to refill my ovidrel & then have to arrange the delivery of the meds, which they say they can definitely ship to me tomorrow & is no big deal. EXCEPT they have to be a pain and treat me like a I'm a pain because I wont be in one place from 8am-4pm and don't know anyone who will. Last month it worked out fine & If I have to go to UPS to get it, I can.

They all just seem so condescending.

Do you try to take things into your own hands or go with the flow? Am I stressing myself out unnecessarily? If I didnt try, I would be on bcp right now. But maybe I wouldn't be as stressed. Or maybe it's the letrozole.

Beer is for me if this cycle fails, otherwise hubby will enjoy it on my behalf.)

But thanks in advance for letting me vent for a while.

My wife and I are having trouble conceiving. I'll try to spare some of the details, but it's been a few years, and we've been down more than a few roads to make it happen. So the last month has been only the most recent, but at the same time the most hopeful, as we waited for results from the latest process.

It's weird, how after we go see The Doc and take the latest round of chlomid or what have you, that we stop talking about it for a while. it's a collective holding of the breath, and we can't do anything but that. you can't talk about the hope, you can't talk about the ""maybe"". You can only sit and wait, talk about the house we're buying, talk about the day, or our weird neighbor, or our other awesome neighbors. Shit, when any given step has been taken, you can't really talk about the disappointment, because then you're just dwelling on it more.

But when my wife's mood changes after coming back in the room, with her response to my question being ""I started spotting"" (again) - man oh man is that a fucking gut-punch.

And a gut-punch for me is fine. As much as I want kids in my family, I've always been fantastically talented at rolling through whatever shit-storm life puts me through. I'll make it fine, I've got my girl. But goddamn the hours spent holding my sobbing wife. Goddamn the silence in the house. Goddamn pouring her (us) another shot of whiskey the day after these miserable nights to help us not focus on the disappointment. Goddamn leaving her home to cry while I've got to go to work. Shit - Goddamn the fact that she's a fucking labor and delivery nurse and every fucking day has to see babies brought into this world, planned babies, mistake babies, traumatic babies, life-changing babies, babies destined for poverty and drug abuse and institutionalized lives. She see's so much in that fucking hospital. I can't imagine her internal conflict at the happy, intentional parents who leap with joy and titter with excitement at meeting their instantly loved child.

But we don't get that, apparently. ""Maybe next time."" Right?

I want to stop for a while. But we would both already be ""older"" parents, although there's still a few years left. But for years already it's been a snowball, this small, little pebble of ""why aren't we getting pregnant"" that rolled into a fucking avalanche of ""WE CAN'T FUCKING GET PREGNANT"".

I don't know folks. It's tough.

Shit, then we can think about the fact that over the years we've had (at least) 3 sets of friends who were told in no uncertain terms that they couldn't have kids, and then, just so fucking magically, whatever powers that be decide that that these previously infertile couples get to have a rambunctious little diaper-filler all their own.

And so we distance ourselves a little from our friends, for it, too. and I know that's a different thing, and our own doing, but man is it tough to watch our awesome friends bring up awesome little children who are going to be awesome people. Less dinner dates, less group outings, less group-family picnics. Because it's fucking tough.

And fuck the neighbor's not-wife who is completely oblivious to the fact that ""When are you going to have children?"" and ""Don't you just want to be a mother?"" are fucking rude ass questions.

Anyhow. I've got to go figure out a way to help my wife. Thanks for listening. Keep kicking ass out there.

Addendum: I know this a sub ""for women's perspectives"", and my perspective is far from that. I think I reach to you guys for exactly this reason. I've learned a fair bit here over time, and most of you have your head on straight. Thanks for letting me vent a little bit.

Nurse #2 at my RE's office and I were talking today, and I mentioned that even though I have a pretty strong gender preference, my greater preference is for healthy baby so I want to just pick the highest quality blast to transfer.

Another option I was considering is not having them tell us anything about gender and telling my RE that if there's a tie for highest quality, please transfer the <gender> one (but not to tell us what was transferred until we do an NIPT test at 10 weeks).

Background - I miscarried last July at 7 weeks, had a D & C, and have had zero luck getting pregnant again. I've had CD3 bloodwork done as well as having my GP check my thyroid, everything has been normal. I don't do very well with temping but it does seem that I ovulate normally. 

I started having some spotting before my period a few months after the D&C, the length of time spotting increased each month until I hit about 8 days. That's 8 days of spotting followed by a 3-5 day period, followed by another 2-4 days of spotting. My doc started me on Clomid, I've done 2 cycles with pretty clear ovulation at days 18 and then 17. This last cycle she also started me on progesterone. None of this has so far affected the spotting. This current cycle I had 4 days of spotting, 5 days of bleeding, and am now on my 3rd day of spotting following my period. 

I decided not to take the Clomid this round for a number of reasons. My OB said we'd try 3 cycles before she sent me off to an RE. I should mention I also had an HSG 2 months ago, which was normal and my husband is getting a referral for SA tomorrow.

Anyway, I guess what I'm getting at is, what should I be asking my doc to look for as far as the spotting is concerned. She had also recommended giving acupuncture a try and I hadn't, partially due to the cost and lack of insurance coverage, but if I'm gonna have to break out the big guns (and my insurance doesn't cover fertility treatments either) I'm wondering if I should just go for it.

We are MFI. Over the last year we had 1 round of IVF: 1 retrieval, 18 eggs, 11 fertilized, 4 embryos, 0 PGS tested. 3 failed FETs (1 leftover). Lots of crushed hopes and lots of emotional an physical discomfort for me. 

We’re starting IVF cycle #2 next week and I’m a wreck. We took the summer off, hoping to feel rejuvenated once August rolled around, but I am starting to feel crazy, and I’m not even on hormones yet! 

I told my husband tonight that I think I only have one more round in me and that’s it. I’m really not handling things well this time around. I'm sure that sounds stupid to those of you who've done many more rounds. 

He didn’t take that news well at all. I don’t even know for sure if I mean it, but the way I feel tonight, I just want this part of our lives to be over. Even if that means being childless, I can’t imagine another year of this hope/devastation roller coaster. 

There are positives this time to focus on. We have a new doctor, will hopefully have new embryos, we’re doing PGS this time. We feel encouraged.

But I just read about someone tonight who, even with PGS, still had three failed FETs with “normal” embryos. Now it’s all I can think about.

I went out shopping with my mother in law last night. She was talking about the toys she’s buying for my nieces and nephew. Then, out of the blue, she turned to me, literally grabbed me by the shoulders, shook me *playfully* and said, “hurry up and have a daughter already so I can shower her with gifts! Ha ha.” 

She knows everything we’re going through. And still… poor choice of words. As if I haven’t done everything I can. I know she means well, but THAT is a perfect illustration of why I feel I can’t talk to anyone I know. NO ONE gets it. Not a single person in my life. 

Not even my husband.  If he had his way, we’d push through round after round until we had our own baby. I’m not in the same place. I’m fine with pursuing adoption or even…. Given enough time and heartbreak… deciding to be childless. I just don’t think I can do it much longer.

If there are any of you out there who have felt a similar desperation and have a happy ending to share, PLEASE tell me. I need anything right now. 

Thank you so much for reading. I don’t even know you, but knowing that you’ve read this means so much to me right now. &lt;3

Edit: I actually had a lovely conversation with my MIL today and she really helped me out with processing some things. (Just didn't feel right to leave this post in a bad place with my MIL. We're all human and we all say stupid things from time to time, even though we mean well.)

Then, out of the blue, she turned to me, literally grabbed me by the shoulders, shook me <em>playfully</em> and said, “hurry up and have a daughter already so I can shower her with gifts! Ha ha.” </p>

<p>She knows everything we’re going through. And still… poor choice of words. As if I haven’t done everything I can. I know she means well, but THAT is a perfect illustration of why I feel I can’t talk to anyone I know. NO ONE gets it. Not a single person in my life. </p>

<p>Not even my husband.  If he had his way, we’d push through round after round until we had our own baby. I’m not in the same place. I’m fine with pursuing adoption or even…. Given enough time and heartbreak… deciding to be childless. I just don’t think I can do it much longer.</p>

<p>If there are any of you out there who have felt a similar desperation and have a happy ending to share, PLEASE tell me. I need anything right now. </p>

<p>Thank you so much for reading. I don’t even know you, but knowing that you’ve read this means so much to me right now. &lt;3</p>

<p>Edit: I actually had a lovely conversation with my MIL today and she really helped me out with processing some things. (Just didn&#39;t feel right to leave this post in a bad place with my MIL. We&#39;re all human and we all say stupid things from time to time, even though we mean well.)</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for your posts. Being reminded I&#39;m not alone really helps. </p>

- Ages: 29f/28m

- 12 cycles resulting in 1 CP

- 2 cycles IUI with Clomid 50 mg.  One monitored with 1 follicle.  Washed sperm counts were 5 and 7 million.  

- HSG: clear and open

- SA: Low normal on all parameters, low morphology

- AMH: 1.2

- AFC: 12

- FSH: ~~10 (I need confirmation on this)~~ 6.6
 
So all our tests were okay.  Not good, but nothing stand out terrible.  Our IVF cycle was 24 days of birth control pills, then 150 Menopur, 225 Puregon (follistim) for 10 days.  Ganirelix 250 was administered for 4 days, including the day of HCG 10,000 trigger.  During monitoring, my E2 levels measured at ~~about 590~~ 557, then about 500, and finally rose to about 900 at last check.  The follicles showed a similar pause in growth between the days when E2 failed to rise.    

ER yielded 7 follicles, of which 5 were mature, 4 fertilized with ICSI.  Three made it to day three transfer, 2 8-cell and 1 6-cell.  All were transferred, beta was negative.  

My RE has reached the conclusion that I am a poor responder to IVF, and although he is willing to try other protocols, it would not be a good use of my resources, as the odds are so low.  He strongly recommends that we move to Donor Eggs at this point.  He also believes I am perimenopausal, and should expect menopause int he next 5-10 years.  

How did all of my okay tests devolve into there being so little hope?

Has anyone experienced low estrogen response, and what did you do about it?

Did anyone have similar situations and dramatically better or different response to the Lupron micro-flare protocol (which is the one he said he would attempt next, if we wanted)?

Other thoughts? Concerns?  Thank you.    

ETA: Spoke with my nurse, but the call got disconnected before I had asked all my questions.  She said that every test predicted a reasonable outcome for IVF, which is why they went ahead with it.  But the E2 progression, coupled with the low follicle count demonstrated that the initial tests were not telling the whole story.

This cycle was supposed to be our first injectible/Bravelle-only cycle, where we're not doing anymore Femara or Clomid. My body has become resistant to the oral meds. On day 8 of it, my husband had to go to the ER for some severe pain and high fever. It turns out he had a severe infection, large abscess, and diverticulitis. It was completely out of the blue- he's a very healthy, fairly young guy. He's been in the hospital since Tuesday, and will probably be able to come home tomorrow. He will still need to be on antibiotics for another 3-4 weeks though, and had a PICC line placed to do that. 

Now that he is feeling much better and we know he's going to be just fine, I can let myself feel a little sad for this cycle. This was supposed to be our last cycle with this crazy clinic and I was excited for that, but now I'm tempted to do another cycle with them.

/u/fortmonkey: I just emailed the PGS nurse to confirm that the embryo from last cycle is definitely getting tested along with these 5. Fingers crossed for good results in 10 days!

I had my follicle scan done today. I have to say, I'm a tad disappointed, but I'm not sure if this is good or not. I'm currently on CD 12. My largest follicle is 14 mm, and then I have two others. I think one was around 10 or 12 mm, and the other was 8 mm. My Dr said my uterine lining was also a little thin. I'm set to trigger on Monday and hopefully will ovulate on Wednesday. 

I did have an unexpected change of events recently. I'm currently on my dad's insurance, which covers 6 IVF rounds in a lifetime. Unfortunately, that insurance will come to an end in January because his company will be switching insurance comapnies, so I talked to my Dr today, and we decided that we will go ahead with IVF if I don't get pregnant this month. He says we will be able to get at least one cycle in before the insurance changes, but that we will freeze any remaining eggs so the cost won't be as much if my new insurance doesn't cover IVF. So by at least October, after a few months of preparation, we will be starting our first round. 

My Dr was amazing today. When I mentioned the issue with insurance, the first thing he said was that we would just go ahead with the IVF after this month. He also wants to have an initial consultation about it and says he has a big presentation he wants us to sit through so we know what will be going on. I have a friend who went to the same office I am going to but went to a different Dr. My Dr was the one who did the transfer for her IVF, and she got pregnant with her gorgeous son, so I feel I am in good hands.

""We want to share one experience to start. We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way.

You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience. Most people don't discuss miscarriages because you worry your problems will distance you or reflect upon you -- as if you're defective or did something to cause this. So you struggle on your own.

In today's open and connected world, discussing these issues doesn't distance us; it brings us together. It creates understanding and tolerance, and it gives us hope. 

When we started talking to our friends, we realized how frequently this happened -- that many people we knew had similar issues and that nearly all had healthy children after all. 

We hope that sharing our experience will give more people the same hope we felt and will help more people feel comfortable sharing their stories as well.

Our good news is that our pregnancy is now far enough along that the risk of loss is very low and we are very hopeful.""

My husband and I have been TTC since October 2014, and I've been temping and timing things accordingly and we've had no positive tests. Due to some fairly consistent luteal phase spotting and an average luteal phase of around 11-12 days (although it can be as short as 9), we went to a fertility clinic. I've had the usual tests - sono, HSG, AMH, blood work, etc - and everything looks normal so far. 

However, we received my husband's SA results, and the figures do not look good. Volume was 6.5ml, count was 0.4M/ml, and motility was 25%. There is a comment on our report that the sample was not suitable for ASA and morphology due to low concentration. 

When my doc gave me the results, she said that we could covert my natural cycle monitoring to an IUI (which would include some sperm testing but not sure what that means exactly), but I knew enough that this didn't feel right.  Instead he will redo the test in a few weeks, including a DNA Fragmentation Index test. If the results come back just as low, then we get a referral for a urologist and see if there's anything they can find.

I now have to wait patiently for a couple of weeks for my path results to come in. Because I have the complex hyperplasia with atypia my risk of possibly having endometrial/uterine cancer are about 30%. Add that to my family history of cancer, and chances are that my risk is slightly higher than normal. Thanks for letting me vent </p>
