I had a monitoring appointment this morning and I have 3 possible follicles: a 12, 14 and 15. The nurse said the 14 and 15 are likely to progress and possibly the 12 too. I'm scheduled to go back on Friday for a check (2 days from now) and the nurse said to bring my shot since they'll probably want me to trigger right away on Friday morning for a Saturday morning IUI (my clinic only does morning appointments on Saturday and is closed on Sunday).

But I'm thinking through the timing, and with an average of 2mm growth per day, I can expect my follicles to be about 16, 18 and 19 on Friday morning. Then we'd do the IUI 24 hours later. Wouldn't it be better to wait until Saturday night to trigger, when my follicles will likely be around 19, 21 and 22, and then do IUI 36 hours later on Monday morning when my clinic is open? 

Am I overthinking this? Is there a reason it's better to trigger as SOON as the lead follicle reaches 18? I'd rather wait until all 3 are mature (if they all keep maturing), but maybe I'm not understanding something. Also, isn't it better to do IUI at 36 hours than 24?

I apologize if this is not the right area to seek this advice but I believe it's relevant. Last week my wife (we'll call her Sarah) had her first HSG test to see if her tubes were open. The doctor couldn't confirm or deny if they were, she only said that Sarah didn't ""pass"" the test and that it would need to be done again. Her tubes accepted the dye but it didn't spread. We have three options: (1) To try the test again with valium (they suspect maybe a spasm occurred), (2) to do surgery (lapro) to see if the tubes are open, and (3) to do In-vitro. The procedure was extremely painful for my wife. I was in the room when it occurred so I can attest to this. Sarah is a bad ass woman who can take a lot of pain. But seeing the pain she endured made my stomach queezy. I felt helpless. Because of this, she's having a hard time with the decision and it's not one I can make for her.  I was hoping other individuals could ease our minds a bit with some honesty. She wants to try the test again with valium since the thought of surgery scares her. She's never had surgery before and has heard that the recovery is extremely painful. Has anyone ""failed"" their first HSG test but passed on the second try? Is this a common occurrence?

 In the last 2.5 years we have had 3 miscarriages and we don't have a single clue as to why.

A little info on each pregnancy:

1st: Conceived naturally shortly after my bc was taken out. Miscarried on 8/1/17 at 6w5d. It was a natural miscarriage and I passed everything overnight. No testing was done as it was our first pregnancy and the OB/GYN didn't think there was anything to it - it was simply 1 in 4 chance.

2nd: Conceived through FET 1.5 years after our first pregnancy (IVF #2). Had a subchorionic bleed. Miscarried on 6/3/19 at 6w3d. Given medication to help the miscarriage along, instead it stopped it and I had to wait another 2 weeks for it to happen naturally again. I had blood work done but they didn't find anything.

3rd: Conceived through a fresh transfer (IVF #4). Had another subchorionic bleed and baby had a low HR. RE said there were 2 yolk sacs and that the baby wouldn't survive. We had to wait for the heartbeat to stop before we could do anything. On 12/23/19 no heartbeat detected. D&C on 12/27. I had blood work done and all came back normal. Anora test said the baby tested normal and had no chromosomal abnormalities.

We have had a lot of testing done and it all comes back normal or negative. Husband and I have both had genetic testing and chromosomal testing done - all normal (I had 2 recessive genes and hubby had 1, but none are the same so no chance of our kid being affected). SA - above average, egg reserves - normal, no blocked tubes, no preexisting conditions (pcos, endo, etc.), thyroid funtion - normal, IGG/IGM - normal (negative), Prolactin - normal, Autoimmune panel - normal, Anti-coagulation panel - normal. During each one of our cycles my numbers are all perfect. We did 6 rounds of medicated cycles with timed intercourse with no luck. They said because the SA was normal and I ovulate on my own that IUI wouldn't really better our chances at all so we skipped it (luckily our insurance allowed it). During our IVF cycles all my blood work comes back normal. My RE seems to be somewhat stumped as to what is causing all this.  

Our last protocol called for doxycycline during stim (Menopur, Ganirelix with Lupron trigger and 1 HCG booster). We did a Neupogen was during the ER. I was on Estrace and PIO after the ER to prep for the fresh transfer. The transfer included HCG inserted into the uterus before the transfer and an HCG booster shot. After the transfer I started Lovenox. We switched from PIO to vaginal progesterone and cancelled the Estrace as my levels tested high with my first beta. This was my version of a kitchen sink cycle. At our post-cycle appointment (before the autoimmune and anti-coagulation panel results) he said that he wasn't sure what else we could try since we threw everything at the last cycle. He said the fact that the IVF is working to get me pregnant, but we have lost all 3 around the same time that it may be caused by something my body is doing that they can't see or test for yet (not enough research on the subject). With that being said, he told us that we may want to consider the use of a gestational carrier - this devastated me. The thought of missing out on physically carrying my child just killed me. If it was our only option I would absolutely do it, but I wouldn't like it (and we have no clue if we could even afford it).

Since my last kitchen sink cycle still didn't end well, my RE had to dig deep to think of something else to try (didn't help that all my tests were normal). So for this next transfer we are throwing even more in. It looks like it will include everything from the last cycle, but will add in prednisone daily. He also wants to do IV Intralipids the day of the transfer. We are waiting till May for this - we plan to take a much needed trip to take some time for us. We have been so busy will all this (and all our spare finances go into it too) that we are both just run down and tired. We need some time to relax and heal. While we are waiting to start treatment up again we will be trying ""the old fashioned way"" since testing shows there is no reason I can't get pregnant on my own (even though I haven't since that first miscarriage). We are hoping this will bring the intimacy back to our relationship, since it got lost in the IVF treatments.

At this point I am so tired, angry, frustrated and devastated. It really weighs on me that I may not be able to carry our child. That experience means so much to me, and to be told at 28 and a half years old that it may never happen just feels like my whole world is collapsing. I know I should be happy we still have the option to use a carrier, and I am....but I know it would be so difficult to watch someone else carry my baby. To watch their belly grow not mine, to only watch the sono and not be the participant, to not be able to talk to my baby every day and have them learn my voice, to not feel the baby kick from the  inside, to not be there for the baby's first kicks on the outside, to not have my husband get to hold my belly to feel his child move, to not get to do maternity photos.....it all seems small in the grand scheme and at least I would have a baby, but to me this bonding time before the baby is born is so important (is that just me or do other people feel this way too?).  I'm scared that I won't get pregnant and I'm scared to get pregnant. These 3 losses have been so hard and it gets worse every time. I am scared to keep trying, but I'm more scared to give up. I want to hope more than anything that this new protocol will work....but sadly this whole journey has taken my hope. I just feel so helpless and hopeless all the time now.

Any advise, words of wisdom, or tips on keeping up hope?

Side note: After every miscarriage I have had someone in my office has gotten pregnant/announced almost immediately after - without fail. I just found out that my coworker (with PCOS), who just finished her 2nd medicated cycle with timed intercourse, is now pregnant. She was kind enough to let me know outside of work since she is one of the few who knows what we have been through (I even gave her tips and information on what to expect when they first started treatment). Her first ultrasound is on 2/4. I am truly happy for her and that she didn't have to go through what I have in her journey, but at the same time I feel so unbelievably jealous and sad that after only 2 cycles with minimum intervention she has already had success. I have already had to watch 2 other coworkers go through their full pregnancies right after loosing my baby. I just don't know how I'm going to get through another one. But without the insurance from this job, we wouldn't be able to try at all.

P.S. I am so thankful to have this community. It helps having somewhere I can say all this and everyone actually knows how it feels or can relate.

Update: Thank you all so much for your advice. I talked to my RE about a few things and he liked them and we will be following through with them. 1. We are having my husband tested for DNA Fragmentation. 2. We will be testing a few more things with blood work including: hemaglovin/hematocrit, ferritin, iron, B12 and vitamin D3. 3. We are going to proceed with a Laparoscopy/Hysteroscopy combo. Hopefully we will get some answers and it's something we can fix.

<p>We have had a lot of testing done and it all comes back normal or negative. Husband and I have both had genetic testing and chromosomal testing done - all normal (I had 2 recessive genes and hubby had 1, but none are the same so no chance of our kid being affected). SA - above average, egg reserves - normal, no blocked tubes, no preexisting conditions (pcos, endo, etc.), thyroid funtion - normal, IGG/IGM - normal (negative), Prolactin - normal, Autoimmune panel - normal, Anti-coagulation panel - normal. During each one of our cycles my numbers are all perfect. We did 6 rounds of medicated cycles with timed intercourse with no luck. They said because the SA was normal and I ovulate on my own that IUI wouldn&#39;t really better our chances at all so we skipped it (luckily our insurance allowed it). During our IVF cycles all my blood work comes back normal. My RE seems to be somewhat stumped as to what is causing all this.  </p>

<p>Our last protocol called for doxycycline during stim (Menopur, Ganirelix with Lupron trigger and 1 HCG booster). We did a Neupogen was during the ER. I was on Estrace and PIO after the ER to prep for the fresh transfer. The transfer included HCG inserted into the uterus before the transfer and an HCG booster shot. After the transfer I started Lovenox. We switched from PIO to vaginal progesterone and cancelled the Estrace as my levels tested high with my first beta. This was my version of a kitchen sink cycle. At our post-cycle appointment (before the autoimmune and anti-coagulation panel results) he said that he wasn&#39;t sure what else we could try since we threw everything at the last cycle. He said the fact that the IVF is working to get me pregnant, but we have lost all 3 around the same time that it may be caused by something my body is doing that they can&#39;t see or test for yet (not enough research on the subject). With that being said, he told us that we may want to consider the use of a gestational carrier - this devastated me. The thought of missing out on physically carrying my child just killed me. If it was our only option I would absolutely do it, but I wouldn&#39;t like it (and we have no clue if we could even afford it).</p>

<p>Since my last kitchen sink cycle still didn&#39;t end well, my RE had to dig deep to think of something else to try (didn&#39;t help that all my tests were normal). So for this next transfer we are throwing even more in. It looks like it will include everything from the last cycle, but will add in prednisone daily. He also wants to do IV Intralipids the day of the transfer. We are waiting till May for this - we plan to take a much needed trip to take some time for us. We have been so busy will all this (and all our spare finances go into it too) that we are both just run down and tired. We need some time to relax and heal. While we are waiting to start treatment up again we will be trying &quot;the old fashioned way&quot; since testing shows there is no reason I can&#39;t get pregnant on my own (even though I haven&#39;t since that first miscarriage). We are hoping this will bring the intimacy back to our relationship, since it got lost in the IVF treatments.</p>

<p>At this point I am so tired, angry, frustrated and devastated. It really weighs on me that I may not be able to carry our child. That experience means so much to me, and to be told at 28 and a half years old that it may never happen just feels like my whole world is collapsing. I know I should be happy we still have the option to use a carrier, and I am....but I know it would be so difficult to watch someone else carry my baby. To watch their belly grow not mine, to only watch the sono and not be the participant, to not be able to talk to my baby every day and have them learn my voice, to not feel the baby kick from the  inside, to not be there for the baby&#39;s first kicks on the outside, to not have my husband get to hold my belly to feel his child move, to not get to do maternity photos.....it all seems small in the grand scheme and at least I would have a baby, but to me this bonding time before the baby is born is so important (is that just me or do other people feel this way too?).  I&#39;m scared that I won&#39;t get pregnant and I&#39;m scared to get pregnant. These 3 losses have been so hard and it gets worse every time. I am scared to keep trying, but I&#39;m more scared to give up. I want to hope more than anything that this new protocol will work....but sadly this whole journey has taken my hope. I just feel so helpless and hopeless all the time now.</p>

<p>Any advise, words of wisdom, or tips on keeping up hope?</p>

<p>Side note: After every miscarriage I have had someone in my office has gotten pregnant/announced almost immediately after - without fail. I just found out that my coworker (with PCOS), who just finished her 2nd medicated cycle with timed intercourse, is now pregnant. She was kind enough to let me know outside of work since she is one of the few who knows what we have been through (I even gave her tips and information on what to expect when they first started treatment). Her first ultrasound is on 2/4. I am truly happy for her and that she didn&#39;t have to go through what I have in her journey, but at the same time I feel so unbelievably jealous and sad that after only 2 cycles with minimum intervention she has already had success. I have already had to watch 2 other coworkers go through their full pregnancies right after loosing my baby. I just don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to get through another one. But without the insurance from this job, we wouldn&#39;t be able to try at all.</p>

<p>P.S. I am so thankful to have this community. It helps having somewhere I can say all this and everyone actually knows how it feels or can relate.</p>

<p>Update: Thank you all so much for your advice. I talked to my RE about a few things and he liked them and we will be following through with them. 1. We are having my husband tested for DNA Fragmentation. 2. We will be testing a few more things with blood work including: hemaglovin/hematocrit, ferritin, iron, B12 and vitamin D3. 3. We are going to proceed with a Laparoscopy/Hysteroscopy combo. Hopefully we will get some answers and it&#39;s something we can fix. Thank you all again for your help.</p>

Medical Background:

I am 33 (F) and husband is 40 (M), we’ve been trying for a combined total of about 2 1/2 years. I have PCOS, and a clotting disorder (Factor II). We had to stop trying for a while after I was diagnosed with a congenial kidney defect that required  two surgeries. After the 2nd surgery, I had a life threatening pulmonary embolism (PE), this is when we discovered the clotting disorder. All doctors involved (urologist, hematologists, RE, etc.) OK’ed us to resume trying 6 months after the PE. We waited another 6 months after that (all the while not preventing) before going back to RE.

I have PCOS, which we knew. We discover my husband has low, but not terrible, morphology at 2%. All his other numbers were good, in the low-normal or normal range. He is a cancer survivor and has two children from his first marriage. The doctor (the top practice in my area), suggested we skip the typical medicated timed-intercourse and go straight to IUI because of the combination of PCOS and my husbands results. 

Treatment:

I responded well to Femara. I triggered with Ovidrel. Husband took Conception XR and other supplements that are supposed to help with sperm quality. I took Ovasitol and other recommended supplements (based on ‘It Starts with the Egg’). I also take a baby aspirin every day (I’ll do daily Lovenox if in ever get pregnant). We did 3 IUI cycles in a row, all three of which failed. I decided I needed a break, so we stopped for 3 months. During this time, I decided to lose weight, since it helps PCOS women with fertility. I lost about 30 pounds on keto. Doctor was very supportive. We decided to give IUI another try. We did a saline sonogram beforehand and found nothing. 4th try: had to up Femara, ultimately response well, but still unsuccessful. 5th try: added promethium, still unsuccessful.

Now what?

Our insurance covered 6 IUI tries, but I stupidly never thought we’d even get to the point where we’d need so many tries. My husband grew up in a very religious family and is uncomfortable with the thought of IVF. His main concern is destroying embryos. I knew this when we were dating, but again, I stupidly never thought we’d be here (We’re actually an interfaith couple, which drives his family crazy—and he’s now progressive about most issues—this one is just hard for him—the religious programming and guilt is hard to undo). I told our RE this and he said to bring him in for a discussion, and that there’s ways to accommodate people’s religious concerns. 

We meet with our RE Tuesday. RE said we may need to test for endo. I am at a complete lose. What do I ask the RE? Is there anything we could be missing? What additional testing should I ask for? Is there a way to IVF that accommodates my husband’s concerns? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

She rubs her bump. I rub my eyes.

All of this jealousy is starting to catch up with me. This resentment has made itself comfortable in my soul. The hate swims through my veins, constantly pulsating to the beat of my sobbing.

Tears have come to be best friendships I can always rely on. They're the only sure thing I have in my life. I dreamt that *maybe* one day I'd be a wife, but the thing I knew for certain, was that I'd be a mother. But now I find, I might have to choose another, something 
to be certain about.

I'm certain I'm empty. 

I'm certainly literally, figuratively, mentally, emotionally
spiritually, physically DAMAGED. 

Getting out of bed feels like a chore. My sadness weighs too much to even hold my arms up to wash my hair, to hold my hands up to my eyes to collect the souvenirs from this trip I never asked to take.  To clap my hands in celebration of another announcement that's not mine- the one I intricately planned I would make. 

But I somehow manage to go through the motions
like telling a colleague, a friend, a family member, a stranger, ""congratulations...you must be so excited...I can't even imagine.""

I'm certain that all the baby names I've loved will fall off the tongues of my friends when they announce they're expecting.

I'm certain every month is spent building a hope fortress that inevitably crumbles around me like the used tissues I've filled with liquid hopes and dreams 
and pleas and PLEAS AND PLEASE AND PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.

I'm certain those first few months felt like a small stumble and we thought we'd find our footing. ""It's fine"", he'd assure me... and month after month he'd pick up the torn pages of this story I never wrote. Glue back together the shards of my soul so we could rebuild our childless household. Climb into the shower so we could both sit, fully clothed as we wept and weren't sure where the salt water began and the fresh water ended.

""Are you trying?"" they ask us without reservation or realization, appreciation, evaluation, of how personal and damaging that question really is. We're trying really hard actually, please get out of our bedroom. Only now it's ""please get out of our doctor's office.""

I'm certain the couples that conceive on their first try will never know this sense of loss...the loss of something I never had...even for a second, even for a third, a fourth....a fifth child.

I'm certain the prick of that needle holds so much promise. Not promise of a pregnancy but promise to wreak havoc on my body, completely attack my identity, my ability to self soothe, my sense of control and reason, my connection with my world , with each other...with myself.

I'm certain anger is starting to far outweigh almost  every emotion- more than the debt we've accrued, the weight that I've gained, the time that we've lost... but not the fear that this just might not happen.

Im certain that I'm uncertain. Can I do this? Can I keep going? Can we do this? Can we keep going? But I do, because I do, because we do.

""This is our year!"", we said, year after year after year
until we didn't anymore. 

I'm certain there was a lesson in this and I've learned it.
I won't ask if you're trying. I won't ask when you're having one more. I won't ask why you only have one. I won't ask if you've considered adoption. I won't tell you to foster or volunteer or ask why you don't consider getting another dog . I won't.  I've learned. 

I'm certain there's a line between positivity and toxic positivity. That line is not the same for everyone, but god damnit, why is that the ONE question you always fail to ask? Don't try to fill my holes with ""hang in there"", ""everything happens for a reason"", ""it will happen, I can just feel it!"", ""just don't think about it!"", ""whatever is meant to be will be."" I've earned these holes while everything else was stolen from me.  Let me have them. 

I'm certain my reality makes you uncomfortable. It makes *me* uncomfortable, but I'm stuck here.

63,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"**EDIT:** I obviously didn't mean to say ""organisms.""

I have a weird one, which my wife is uncomfortable asking the doctor.

We recently had a chemical pregnancy with a PGS-tested embryo.  Between our first two beta HCG tests, my wife woke up in the middle of the night with 30 minutes of extremely strong lower pelvic cramps.  (She mentioned that they were lower than menstrual cramps, which has some bearing on the rest of this post.)

We were worried, but the second beta HCG showed a good rise.  The night of the second HCG, though, she had another episode.

3-4 days later, she started miscarrying.

We linked these cramps to the miscarriage, but three weeks after the miscarriage, she had another episode.  And three weeks after **that**, another one.  Ultrasounds and a hysteroscopy showed nothing, our doctor was stumped, and we were both pretty freaked out.

But... after the last one, she admitted that just before waking up, she had a sex dream and right before waking up, she was about to have an orgasm in her dream.  The same situation happened the last two times, as well.  (The first time, she's not sure.)

Some googling suggested that these were nocturnal orgasms, which apparently aren't terribly uncommon in pregnant women.  And I was able to find some people saying they were painful.

She never had a nocturnal orgasm prior to her brief pregnancy, and while she doesn't have painful orgasms normally, she does have some discomfort and lack of pleasure with vaginal penetration.

<p>I have a weird one, which my wife is uncomfortable asking the doctor.</p>

<p>We recently had a chemical pregnancy with a PGS-tested embryo.  Between our first two beta HCG tests, my wife woke up in the middle of the night with 30 minutes of extremely strong lower pelvic cramps.  (She mentioned that they were lower than menstrual cramps, which has some bearing on the rest of this post.)</p>

<p>We were worried, but the second beta HCG showed a good rise.  The night of the second HCG, though, she had another episode.</p>

<p>3-4 days later, she started miscarrying.</p>

<p>We linked these cramps to the miscarriage, but three weeks after the miscarriage, she had another episode.  And three weeks after <strong>that</strong>, another one.  Ultrasounds and a hysteroscopy showed nothing, our doctor was stumped, and we were both pretty freaked out.</p>

<p>But... after the last one, she admitted that just before waking up, she had a sex dream and right before waking up, she was about to have an orgasm in her dream.  The same situation happened the last two times, as well.  (The first time, she&#39;s not sure.)</p>

<p>Some googling suggested that these were nocturnal orgasms, which apparently aren&#39;t terribly uncommon in pregnant women.  And I was able to find some people saying they were painful.</p>

<p>She never had a nocturnal orgasm prior to her brief pregnancy, and while she doesn&#39;t have painful orgasms normally, she does have some discomfort and lack of pleasure with vaginal penetration.</p>

<p>But, my question is... since we&#39;re not supposed to have sex for awhile after an FET, doesn&#39;t that mean nocturnal orgasms can trigger the same uterine contractions they&#39;re worried about when they advise against sex?</p>

<p>And wouldn&#39;t that be a bad thing?</p>

The aforementioned person has alluded that I should wait for ""the perfect cycle"" before beginning IVF, which ideally will be right after my period starts this cycle. We've already purchased the meds, so part of the persons' commentary includes ""blowing"" the cost of the meds and not having the right amount of eggs, etc. That somehow, having a long cycle will somehow give me a bad or false start for IVF.

<p>The aforementioned person has alluded that I should wait for &quot;the perfect cycle&quot; before beginning IVF, which ideally will be right after my period starts this cycle. We&#39;ve already purchased the meds, so part of the persons&#39; commentary includes &quot;blowing&quot; the cost of the meds and not having the right amount of eggs, etc. That somehow, having a long cycle will somehow give me a bad or false start for IVF. </p>

<p>I feel that a cycle is a cycle no matter how long, my body is going through the same process. I&#39;m so tired of timed cycle monitoring. IUI is an option, but my doctor&#39;s have advised it&#39;s not worth the money in our scenario. </p>

<p>No googling has ever done me good. I wonder if anyone here has experienced anything similar. Should we wait another cycle? Would sticking to <em>my</em> normal be wiser?</p>

my husband has a genetic disorder that prevents him from producing sperm without medication. in january 2019, his SA showed complete azoospermia. he was started on three times weekly Hcg/pregnyl only, and about six month later in July 2019 his SA showed a sperm concentration of 0.5 mil/mL — he was then also started on FSH/gonal-F also three times a week.

Per his RU, we knew this process may take a while for improvement and there may be ceiling he would hit in terms of possible sperm concentration, however this past october, we were both surprised when i got a positive pregnancy test at home. unfortunately, it was an ectopic. i was treated with three doses of mtx thankfully and avoided surgery.  the whole process was so difficult, but out glass-half-full perspective was that we actually had a pregnancy! 


i had a follow up HSG which actually showed normal tubes/no blockages. my husband continued his meds, and i was hopeful that given the unassisted conception, his SA had massively improved! well unfortunately he just had it repeated — while there was sign of mild improvement, the concentration was still incredibly low at 5mil/mL (total count around 16mil). all other parameters were normal. we were completely crushed. i was so hopefully for normal numbers as the only saving grace from that whole mess.

we’re now at a treatment crossroads. we can continue the long wait and hope for improvement in his SA which is possible, however 1) it’s very slow moving and 2) per his RU, after a year of treatment only some patients improve.

for those dealing with MFI and have partners with similar SAs, did you do IUI or IVF? or has anyone been in a similar genetic situation and can give us an estimated timeline for potential or possible SA improvement? any other advice? our RE and RU are very flexible with us

I'm a female, age 35, good AMH (>5) and no other big issues identified in testing. (Small polyp removed in hysteroscopy). I ovulate pretty regularly but not so much lately - long/weird cycles 2 of the last 4, not sure why. 

My partner is male, age 30, mild-moderate MFI, mostly progressive motility issues, but also borderline counts, and poor morphology. This is based on a large varicocele that the doctor doesn't want to fix now because he says it could take 6 months to 2 years to start seeing improvement and doesn't want to delay us this long. 

We tried on our own for almost a year, and then did 1 IUI last year with letrozole 5 mg. My response was about what they said they wanted - follices at 18 and 15 at trigger. TMSC was only 3 mil post-wash after pre-wash of 64 mil. I felt so stressed during the TWW (more than I expected), but obviously negative results.

We are debating what to do now - doctors' say we have a chance with IUI and could do about 3 more before looking at other options, but if our post-wash counts stay so low and with only one mature egg, the chance seems so small per cycle (<5%) that I'm really wondering whether it's worth the stress and extra time. 

We have insurance coverage for IUI, but not for IVF. We used CNY for our IUI, and they are pretty reasonable for IVF (we could probably do a cycle for $8-9,000?).

An update; a second semen analysis after 3 months of waiting and taking fish oil vitamins and FertilAid showed the same results: 0 sperm. A physical exam from the urologist found that his left vas deferens is missing. 

The doctor does not believe the right testicle is producing sperm due to the hormones being normal which indicates there is not a blockage. He said if the left testicle is producing sperm, there’s no way for it to get out due to the lack of vas deferens.

We’re already talking about the possibility of donor sperm and want to consider asking his brother. We’re not sure if he will accept or how he will take it. If not, then it would be onto random unknown donor. 

Anyways, just thought I’d update. Basically, no good news.

ETA- I am with Emblem Health Silver Value Plan. 

One more edit- I’m getting some conflicting info from Emblem now and not sure what’s covered. I got “yes IVF is covered” from 2 reps and “not covered” from 1. I’m still working through it as is my clinic. It’s definitely worth calling your insurance to try to figure out.

One of my best friends is an infertility therapist and has been there for me so much over the past months of treatment and negative results. She and her husband started trying for baby #2 this month (baby #1 was conceived the first month they tried, so she has no personal experience with infertility), and this morning she sent me a bunch of pictures of her positive pregnancy tests. She was concerned it might be a chemical, because they aren't strong positives. I broke down sobbing in my RE office, where I was waiting for an ultrasound to start my new cycle (since I just had another failed cycle). I don't know if she's having a chemical or not, but trying to help her figure it out from the pictures of positive tests was like a knife to the fucking heart. I never cry in public, and I barely cry in private, either. This was extremely unlike me, but it just HURT. I thought she would know better than to do that to me. I feel like the person I trusted most in this process just gutted me, and it sucks on so many levels.

Of course I'm happy for her - I wouldn't wish these struggles on my worst enemy, let alone one of my best friends. But I feel more alone than ever now. 

Help?

EDITED TO ADD: I just want to let everyone know that my friend and I worked it out. She is a wonderful, kind, compassionate person - I think she just got confused because we've been talking so much lately and she didn't want to keep it from me and make me feel excluded (which I would have if she didn't tell me she was pregnant at all). It's just a hard situation all around. Also, she doesn't just specialize in fertility, she also focuses on post-partum issues - she had an extremely traumatic birth experience with her first child, and experienced post-partum PTSD and depression as a result. 

She texted me this tonight: ""I honestly have felt terrible all day about our conversation. I feel like I of all people should have known better. I'm so sorry for causing you any additional pain. I wish I could do more to make this whole situation less unfair to you. I'm so glad you told me how you felt. Thank you for always being honest with me.

I'm 24 and the only fertility issue that runs in my family is PCOS. A couple years ago, I signed up to donate my eggs because I was strapped for cash. I got picked last year and had an ultrasound and bloodwork done. I didn't receive my results until after the egg donation agency received them. They called me at work, told me they can't take my eggs, and that if I want to work with them in the future I know how to reach them. I asked them to email me my results so I can understand why.

My amh was .54 and my fsh was 18. Reading these at the time, I had no clue what they meant. I started googling the terms and the norms, which was a terrible idea because I was at work. Needless to say, I had a complete breakdown in the bathroom. 

A year and 2 blood tests later, I still don't have any answers as to the why. I had a consultation with a real fertility specialist today instead of my obgyn, and I feel hopeless as ever. She suspects that I have premature ovarian aging and that I might already be premenopausal due to many symptoms I've been having. I go back for more fertility blood tests next cycle along with some chromosomal blood tests to figure out the why.

My tests indicate DOR. I've been supplementing with CoQ10 the last 2 months, along with a few other things, while I go through further testing.

The only studies I can find for use in fertility referencing DOR and egg quality are for a 600mg daily divided dose of CoQ10. It Starts With The Egg recommends 400-600mg of Ubiquinol of either kind.

Here is my introduction to this club no one wants to be a part of. I created a new username for this because we haven't told anyone except my mom about the diagnosis.

After several months of TTC, my husband and I visited an RE to see if anything was going on. At that time, it was found that he had zero sperm in his sample. The analysis was repeated once more, and it was zero again. It was incredibly shocking and devastating as I'm sure many of you know from experience. From what we can tell, I have normal fertility (although I'm definitely not getting any younger).

My husband saw a reproductive urologist who works closely with our RE, and he was diagnosed with non-obstructive azoospermia, most likely maturation arrest. His testosterone is extremely low and his FSH and LH levels are very high to compensate. All of his genetic testing came back normal, so the doctor believes he falls into the about 25% of cases that are idiopathic. The doctor said he wouldn't have guessed my husband had azoospermia upon physical examination and medical history unless he had seen his numbers.

mTESE, a rather invasive surgical procedure in which the man's testicles are essentially biopsied under a high powered microscope in the hopes of finding usable sperm, is the only procedure that would offer any hope of us having a child that is both genetically ours. The doctor has given about a 40-45% chance of successfully retrieving sperm from him (this is based on the literature). But then in the best case scenario, I would have to go through IVF with ICSI, and it's a game of diminishing odds of success each round (mTESE, IVF, fertilization, implantation, miscarriage risk, etc.). Neither of us knows if we want to go on this emotional rollercoaster when in the end, in the most successful scenario, we may only have a 15% chance of having a live ""take-home"" baby (I pulled the 15% stat from this paper [""Reporting on longitudinal live birth rates and cumulative delivery rates are more realistic outcome measures than sperm retrieval rates in couples undergoing mTESE–ICSI""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29745280/).)

Nether of us are opposed to using a donor. In fact, my husband is very ok with it; it's me who's having a harder time with it. I wanted my husband's child; I want a chance to have a kid with his smile and his intelligence, and I'm sad that may never be possible. I also feel guilty because there are people facing way worse problems than this; we otherwise have a really nice life. I would be ok with a donor, but I've read some horror stories from donor conceived people (the subreddit on here is super depressing). I discussed this (and other things) with a counseling psychologist who specializes in infertility and does donor consults, and she affirmed my suspicion that these people probably have issues that go way beyond being donor conceived (a lot of it seems to have to do with not being told), and with good parenting that can be avoided. I have other qualms about the sperm bank industry as well, and she emphasized that's why it's important to vet the bank first. If we went that route, we'd be open and transparent to our child about their origin from a young age.

I was really coming to terms with this with my husband (it's been about 2 months since the diagnosis) until last night when my brother told me that he and my SIL are pregnant with what will be my first niece or nephew. While I'm really happy for them, I also feel selfishly devastated that my husband and I may never experience that feeling in the ""normal"" way that most people do (I obviously didn't mention this to my brother and offered only congratulations; he doesn't know about the diagnosis). My husband and I have been together for a long time, and we've gone through other struggles before and gotten through them, but it seems like whenever I'm feeling ok with this, something reminds me that I'm not yet.

We're both on the fence about doing a mTESE. It sounds awfully painful (the surgeon didn't sugarcoat that) and with a low chance of success. My husband said he's not the type to feel like we have to exhaust every option to have a biological child. He grew up in a non-traditional family, and I 100% believe he would love a donor conceived child the same as if it were genetically his. I've told him it's his body, so he should ultimately make the decision about the procedure. He said that's putting it all on him, which is a fair assessment. I have analysis paralysis about it. Sometimes I wish these were the days before mTESE and ICSI, so we just knew what our only choice was (not really, but I'm horrible at coming to a decision about things like this). Obviously if the mTESE wasn't successful, we'd know where we stood, but having it out there as an option is making it paralyzing to move forward with a decision.

**I see all these stories about going through with mTESE, but I'd like to know if anyone chose not to and went straight to another option instead that didn't involve having children that were both genetically yours.

Neither of us knows if we want to go on this emotional rollercoaster when in the end, in the most successful scenario, we may only have a 15% chance of having a live &quot;take-home&quot; baby (I pulled the 15% stat from this paper <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29745280/"">&quot;Reporting on longitudinal live birth rates and cumulative delivery rates are more realistic outcome measures than sperm retrieval rates in couples undergoing mTESE–ICSI&quot;</a>.)</p>

<p>Nether of us are opposed to using a donor. In fact, my husband is very ok with it; it&#39;s me who&#39;s having a harder time with it. I wanted my husband&#39;s child; I want a chance to have a kid with his smile and his intelligence, and I&#39;m sad that may never be possible. I also feel guilty because there are people facing way worse problems than this; we otherwise have a really nice life. I would be ok with a donor, but I&#39;ve read some horror stories from donor conceived people (the subreddit on here is super depressing). I discussed this (and other things) with a counseling psychologist who specializes in infertility and does donor consults, and she affirmed my suspicion that these people probably have issues that go way beyond being donor conceived (a lot of it seems to have to do with not being told), and with good parenting that can be avoided. I have other qualms about the sperm bank industry as well, and she emphasized that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to vet the bank first. If we went that route, we&#39;d be open and transparent to our child about their origin from a young age.</p>

<p>I was really coming to terms with this with my husband (it&#39;s been about 2 months since the diagnosis) until last night when my brother told me that he and my SIL are pregnant with what will be my first niece or nephew. While I&#39;m really happy for them, I also feel selfishly devastated that my husband and I may never experience that feeling in the &quot;normal&quot; way that most people do (I obviously didn&#39;t mention this to my brother and offered only congratulations; he doesn&#39;t know about the diagnosis). My husband and I have been together for a long time, and we&#39;ve gone through other struggles before and gotten through them, but it seems like whenever I&#39;m feeling ok with this, something reminds me that I&#39;m not yet.</p>

<p>We&#39;re both on the fence about doing a mTESE. It sounds awfully painful (the surgeon didn&#39;t sugarcoat that) and with a low chance of success. My husband said he&#39;s not the type to feel like we have to exhaust every option to have a biological child. He grew up in a non-traditional family, and I 100% believe he would love a donor conceived child the same as if it were genetically his. I&#39;ve told him it&#39;s his body, so he should ultimately make the decision about the procedure. He said that&#39;s putting it all on him, which is a fair assessment. I have analysis paralysis about it. Sometimes I wish these were the days before mTESE and ICSI, so we just knew what our only choice was (not really, but I&#39;m horrible at coming to a decision about things like this). Obviously if the mTESE wasn&#39;t successful, we&#39;d know where we stood, but having it out there as an option is making it paralyzing to move forward with a decision.</p>

<p><strong>I see all these stories about going through with mTESE, but I&#39;d like to know if anyone chose not to and went straight to another option instead that didn&#39;t involve having children that were both genetically yours. Was there any regret? What has your experience been like?</strong></p>

I started back up at a different clinic to start interventions and started the testing phase in the last 2 weeks — apparently my AMH is low, and even though the last doctor acted like even if there was an issue she would work with me, this doctor is much much older and is  acting like I can’t do any interventions because I just turned 40 last month and my AMH is low so he says I disqualify for any IVF treatment and maybe IUI treatment also. Other levels like FSH were good, and I’m ovulating with a decent amount of follicles so I’m just surprised and upset that he’s saying my journey is over already basically and I never even started anything. 

This was even my first month taking Clomid day 3-7 and we couldn’t have sex during ovulation because they said he had to wait because he had to bring the semen sample literally the same time I was ovulating.  

I don’t know what my experience should be like — if this is “normal”. 

I just don’t feel like my experience should be normal. I always just assumed if I had issues that a doctor would work with me to “try” different things, it would be a journey, and I would at least get to try. 

I don’t really ever get to see the doctor, and the nurse just called me to tell me the AMH is low (and my vit d is dangerously low at only a 6, which she didn’t tell me but I later found out on here could be a reason — which it was never even mentioned to retest after getting vit d back up etc) She just said “you have a low AMH level which means you can’t ever do IVF” and then basically hung up. I would have liked to have a doctor or even nurse tell me in person where I can ask questions and so on, not leave me crying for days confused and scared and hopeless. 

When I went in today for my mid-cycle ultrasound and blood work they didn’t tell me anything — it was an ultrasound tech, no doctor again, and when I was laying on the table after the ultrasound was done the tech said “doctor will call you sometime about the ultrasound and bloodwork bye” and walked out the door, and I just got dressed and walked out of the office without anything more.

Also, the clinic I’ve been going to has super old ultrasounds and equipment that looks like it’s from the 90’s which I find odd. When the nurse told me my AMH is low and I “can’t” do IVF I asked about mini / micro IVF and she told me that Dr. Hickey doesn’t do it and doesn’t recommend it so no. 

This is a clinic that’s in Hinsdale IL — in a super high income Chicago suburb; I can’t afford nor would want to LOL live there because of how conservative it is, but many of my clients are from there and I was recommended this clinic by a few of my clients.  My experience there just seems so strange and it’s become such a negative thing already. I’m trying to figure out if it’s just me and how I feel about it all or not. 

I guess I just want to know others peoples experiences — if you’ve encountered any “issues” has your doctor had the nurse tell you on the phone pointblank you can’t do interventions? Or do they talk to you and give you options? 

When you go in for an ultrasound appointment, do they tell you what they see then and there? Or do they stay quiet and call you later to tell you about what the ultrasound showed? Also, does your clinic use super old ultrasounds or newer technology equipments? (I’m wondering if this can change the outcome) 

Please tell me your experiences! My husband is refusing me to go elsewhere, saying I should just stick it out there — he has this mentality that ALL doctors are the same basically, and I just don’t agree, so I’m trying to figure out how my experiences compare to others experiences in the hopes of convincing him to let us find a different doctor / clinic. Thanks so much 💚💚💚💚💚💚

Edit — Update — The doctor never even called me to tell me results of ultrasound &amp; blood test - the Front Desk lady did! she said “we couldn’t see any ovulation that occurred and your estrogen is low” I started asking questions but since she’s the front desk she had no answers. I got super upset and called back left message asking for doctor to call me, no call :(

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Infertility includes: primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

As many of you may know there are still a lot of costs associated. In addition the clinic is about as far across the country as you can get (we’re in Seattle and they’re in south Florida) and the doctor is requiring I stay in South Florida for almost a month (during stims, retrieval, and transfer). As a result our out of pocket costs will be at least $10k ($15.5k when factoring our time off). 

Obviously we’re happy to do this if it is our only option, but after running the numbers I started to look into our treatment in 2017 and the costs here in Seattle. 

When we were undergoing treatment in 2017 we did several timed intercourse cycles using letrozole and two IUIs—one with letrozole and one with letrozole and gonal-f. Thereafter it was recommended we pursue IVF. HOWEVER after looking at my records it appears that I was not on metformin during my treatments (I have PCOS and apparently it is standard and treatments are more effective [about 69% apparently] when PCOS patients are on metformin during fertility treatments). 

In addition, I looked at Fertility IQ’s surveys and the average total cycle cost reported by respondents indicates that we could do a complete round (including medication) locally for $15k. 

So here are my questions:

1. Should we consider doing more IUI cycles?

I hope I'm not out of line in posting here as I don't have an official infertility diagnosis, but I was seeking some advice on my situation. I have been having irregular menstrual cycles and went to see a new ob/gym yesterday. His initial concern was PCOS, so he decided to do a transvaginal ultrasound. Yesterday was CD32. My ultrasound showed my uterine lining was 3.7mm. He said he didn't see a corpus luteum so I haven't ovulated yet, and that my ovaries look fine ie. not polycystic. I also have a normal testosterone level. He ended up ordering some additional bloodwork, and specifically mentioned a concern about diminished ovarian reserve or an issue with my ovaries producing estrogen as my lining is too thin at this point of my cycle. I'm currently waiting for my bloodwork results (AMH, prolactin, estrogen, FSH, LH, TSH, T4, and thyroid antibody tests) to come back. 


I was wondering if anyone had a finding of thin uterine lining and what your diagnosis was. Also, how was it treated? I got a positive OPK today, and I'm kind of thinking even if I did ovulate my lining would be too thin for an embryo to implant

I posted earlier about my IVF retrieval, specifically, the reduced blast rate from 33 eggs (19 mature) and 12 fertilized. A lot of you suggested potential male factor because of the drop between day 3 and day 5 embryos. My husband’s most recent (November 2019) semen analysis showed poor morphology (2%)  but otherwise normal count (139 million) and motility (56%). Male factor has not really been considered for us because his initial semen analysis was normal.

My husband wants to wait for our PGS results before doing any additional testing. He thinks we should proceed with a transfer assuming we have a normal embryo. 

I’m inclined to request more testing to get a fuller picture. I’m just not sure how to convince my RE given that it wouldn’t change her plan.

Confused about what to do at this point besides wait for the PGS results. I’m turning 34 in a week and feel like I’m losing time. I feel so frustrated, lonely and isolated in this process. This is really the only place I can reach out for advice.

If you choose to read it I'm thankful to you. I'm not sure if anyone here remembers me, I used to post more frequently years ago. I'm 30 years old, going on 31 this year. My husband is 29 and we've been married since 2014. We started trying for a baby on the honeymoon. It's now past 5 years since we started trying, during which time I've had a miscarriage and a chemical. I've been diagnosed with PCOS, polyps, and my husband with low motility.

When we started trying, everyone told us we'd be pregnant in no time. Nobody else has had trouble getting pregnant in my direct bloodline. They've had trouble staying pregnant, there's been a lot of losses, but no infertility. We started trying at the same time as about 10 other married  couples in our friends groups. In the past 5 years, all of them have graduated to parenthood, some of them multiple times. So, basically, I dont have anybody left irl who knows what I'm going through and can be an understanding friend. Everyone I've ever considered a friend is now a parent. They can't even hang out anymore because ""there's nobody to watch my kids!"" Well... what do you even say to that?

I'll have days where I think I'm finally coming to terms with it, then something happens and I'm right back to square one. Like two days ago I had a dream that I took a pregnancy test and it read 8000+ hcg. Now all I can think about are the three dollar store cheapies hidden away in my medicine cabinet, dying to go pee on one, despite the fact that my uterus WONT FUCKING STOP BLEEDING! 12 days. I'm fucking over it. 

Honestly it just feels like God has singled me out as being unworthy of a child. Literally everyone I know has at least one. I completely avoided the hell out of my high school reunion because literally everyone in my graduating class has kids. 

We even tried foster care and foster-to-adopt. That didn't work either. I've been thinking about trying that again, but I'm just so damn depressed about the whole fucking situation. I'm sure they don't want to put traumatized neglected children with a person struggling with depression. We're never going to have the money to try IVF. My doctor says IUI wouldn't be a good option due to MFI and my lack of response to ovulation meds. We signed up for the embryo donation at my clinic, but it's been 3 years without a single call. I just dont know where to turn anymore, it feels like my life has no purpose. I've become the aunt who couldn't have kids of her own. And what's worse, nobody seems to care besides my mom. She's very gungho about us having a baby. My husband wants kids but he's perfectly okay with a childless life, he's accepted the inevitable. My dad said he didn't think we were ready. My only sister shows zero emotion either way, because she married into a huge family where new babies are born every fucking year. I've never felt so alone. I don't even know anybody who has been trying as long as we have. Even online I mostly see one year, two years, occasionally 3-4 years. But over 5.5 years? That's rare, very few and far in between. 

Question is, where do I even go from here? Without children, my life looks pretty bleak. Working 9-5 monday through friday, every week for the rest of my life, at a career I absolutely despise. At least my husband has the luxury of a job he enjoys, he's not forced to be miserable with me. Watching as my husband and I grow old, watching as my nieces and nephews grow up and have families of their own. It all feels so hopeless. If you've made it this far, thank you for your time.

Doc found a fundal adhesion during my sonohysterogram. It’s apparently tiny and everything else looks good. I’m scheduled for a hysteroscopy where they also go in with tiny scissors and clip any adhesions they see.

A bit of history: 
Young, otherwise healthy. Previously pregnant resulting in very early loss. Retained products required a manual vacuum aspiration (which is supposed to decrease the likelihood of resulting in adhesions). 

Have been trying for 1.5 years with no success. 

My issue is that the adhesion they did see was only 0.3 x 0.4 cm in size and it feels to me as if going through mini surgery is a bit of a leap... it’s a teaching hospital so my thoughts immediately go towards the learning aspect.

(this is my first reddit post ever, so please tell me if im doing something wrong. Also english is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes!)

My name is Beth and im 18 years old and im here because im finding it difficult to find people that relate to my story and i think this is the best place for this?

i was diagnosed with an ovarion cyst at 9 years old in 2010, they weren't able to save my ovary so i had one left after that, which wasn't a problem i was told. A couple of years later when i was 14, they found another cyst on my other ovary. This time they could save my ovary so after surgery  i was living my life as normal again.  A month ago they found one again and my doctor started worrying about my fertility if this would keep happening. Because im 18 i am able to have my eggs frozen before surgery. Now im waiting for my next cycle to start the egg freezing procedure and im feeling super stressed about it. I know that people who go through these things research ivf and infertility procedures for months/years and im feeling overwhelmed having only a month to prepare for this (mostly mental). Im also freshman in college and the entire month of january i have exams, so im feeling really lonely sitting in my room all day worrying about everything. ive tried to find information about dealing with these things as a teen because no one of my age understands what im going through. Dont get me wrong, they are amazing and they support me alot, but i still feel like im battling this alone.

This is my first post and I'm super excite to be part of this forum.

I just got back from picking up my 3 month supply of Omnitrope from my local Costco Canada Pharmacy when the cashier told me that there was a note on my prescription saying that the Costco pharmacy was phasing out Omnitrope (not going to carry it anymore). I was shocked as I believed that such a large pharmacy would always carry it. My doctor told me to purchase it from Costco because they had the best price.

Anyways, after finishing my shopping, while i was sitting in the car in the parking lot about to leave, I decide to give the same pharmacy a call and speak to a pharmacist to confirm the information that I was told. The pharmacist told me that all Costco's were phasing out Omnitrope and that I would need to source it from a different pharmacy.

Can anyone else confirm that they have heard the same and where do others on this forum get their HGH prescription from? How much does it cost you? The last time I shopped around for HGH, everyone else was much more expensive. Any thoughts?

209,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi Everyone! I've been lurking for a bit and may have posted a couple times in the dailies. I've done some research (and read all the sidebar/wikis - thank you!). I'm writing now to seek your perspectives on my next steps for treatment. I'm 38 (F) and my partner is 35(M). I do have a child from a previous marriage. We've been trying since Sept '18 and in that time I've dealt with a broken IUD (part never found, multiple types of scans have shown no evidence in my body), 2 early miscarriages (around 5/6 weeks), and recent ectopic that was removed along with my right tube. All three pregnancies were conceived without medical assistance; however, for most of the summer we did TI with letrozole and progesterone support (my OB thinks I have a luteal phase deficiency). When we moved to the RE in September, we did one IUI with letrozole and ovidrel trigger. 

I have really low AMH (like nearly undetectable) but ok AFC (12 at last check). I respond well to letrozole, so although I have DOR my RE is confident we can have success since we just need one good egg. My husband's sperm analysis showed him slightly below normal in nearly all categories, but we've actually frozen a bunch of sperm because he is not medically allowed to TTC at the moment, and can work from that supply. 

This is where my question comes in: because of my recent ectopic pregnancy, my RE is now recommending IVF over IUI. Her logic is this: although I respond well to IUI, we don't know why I had the ectopic and so my risk is slightly higher than not having an ectopic. With that history, and of course with my age, we're better off bypassing my tubes. We have no infertility insurance coverage, so this would almost entirely be out of pocket (unclear if insurance would cover bloodwork, scans, etc). She did say that if we wanted to pursue more IUI, she still supports that decision. The decision is up to me.

On a personal level, I need to heal for a while before I dive back into treatment. I'm considering either A) Phasing back into trying with an IUI using frozen sperm this spring to see if that will work, and then moving to IVF in the summer/fall if needed, or B) saving my money and energy to do IVF this summer. For context, I'm a professor and do have summers off from teaching, though this year is a big deal because I have to turn my tenure file in in September, so I'll need to focus on this high-stakes document that determines whether I keep my job.

I'm also curious about financial assistance programs: my clinic uses the ARC success program and financing, so I'd love to hear about experiences with them (especially for older women/DOR where I may need to try a few protocols).

I'm really trying to work through how to proceed: it's a lot of money for no guarantee of success. We're happy with our current family but both want a child together.

I came into my fertility clinic's office, signed some paperwork, and got changed into a gown. The anesthesiologist came in (she was awesome) and we all caravanned into the operating room. My nurses strapped my legs onto some knee stirrups while the anesthesiologist put in the IV, they put a pulse ox meter and blood pressure cuff on me, and we were basically ready. Doctor walked in, anesthesiologist asked me where I wanted to go during my ""dream"" and said she would be pushing the medicine and to take a few deep breaths. I counted in my head 100...99...98... and then I woke up cozily tucked under some blankets. I'd been out for about an hour, they said. 

I was a little groggy and I shivered (my body's response to anesthesia, had it before when I had my wisdom teeth out)...but oh my god did I have to PEE. I had to pee SO BAD. I think we were there for about 20 minutes and I was just trying not to piss myself. They gave me Tylenol (maybe the kind with codein?) and handed the prescriptions to my husband. I squirmed trying to hold my pee. I was making backup plans (quick, grab that trash can!) and finally they said I could get up, pee, and get dressed. So I finally peed.... but the feeling of having to pee did not go away. For a next few hours I just had this intense feeling of having to pee. We drove home - I threw up along the way, not sure if that was from the Tylenol 3 or from anesthesia, my body doesn't tolerate shocks like that very well. I felt better after puking, though, and it only happened the one time. Thank god I always keep a spare trash bag in my car. So my husband got me home, I changed into my sweatpants, grabbed a hot pad, and slept for a while. I still really had the feeling of having to pee for hours, but about 10 hours later now it's finally gone. As far as the pain, it's just been like a light cramp all day. There's been a little bit of bleeding but we're used to that, aren't we ladies? Ha. I got jokes. I've spent most of the day napping, browsing reddit, and sending my husband out to get Olive Garden for me.

We recently saw the RE and started testing, and based on the results so far (still more to do) I think this sub is the right place to be (plus so you all seem so wonderfully supportive, and I could use some of that right now - I promise to give it back to you all as well!). 

Quick backstory - my husband and I got married in May 2019, I stopped birth control, and we started trying in June 2019. Our biggest obstacle is being older - I’ll be 36 in a few weeks and he is 48. I am thrilled to have found the love of my life and we are SO wanting to have a family together. Neither of us tried to have children until now. We had a CP in Nov after 2 weeks of positive tests - it sucked. My cycle was super regular right off the bat after birth control, but given our ages I wanted to see the RE after 6 months. I saw the RE in Dec and just did my blood tests. Felt good about the first results that rolled in - everything checked out ok including FSH. Vitamin D a smidge low at 27 so I started taking that. But then today my AMH came in at 0.517, which led to a flurry of googling and worry. Husband will do his SA within the next couple of weeks and I’ll have an HSG in Feb and then we’ll meet with the RE again. 

I’m trying to not get too ahead of myself because we don’t have all of the data yet and of course we’ll have to see what the RE says, however my husband and I have already agreed and if she thinks IVF would be an option for us we might want to jump on it ASAP. We definitely don’t have unlimited financial reserves, but we are financially secure and are ready to pursue it from a financial perspective. I guess I can’t tell whether my anxiety is leading to a rash decision of just going all in with IVF right away, or whether this is actually totally rational and would be the best option to jump to if we are dealing with DOR and older partners. We would be thrilled to have any children at all, and more than one would be amazing, so I suppose there’s some allure to the idea of having embryos to freeze for later as well (I totally get that IVF is a hard road and no guarantee though).

&nbsp;

Hi there. I have been lurking for a while, and finally got the guts to introduce myself and share my experiences so far. My journey has been a little different than average.

&nbsp;

I am a 29 year old woman. My mom experienced premature menopause when she was ~30, shortly after I was born - the cause was unknown because they didn't have the genetic testing back then that they do now. About 4-5 years ago I was in a med school lecture given by a pediatric endocrinologist, and she mentioned briefly that all women who experience POI should undergo screening for Fragile X premutations. This really stuck in my head, so I asked my OB/gyn about whether I should be concerned. His response was, ""Really? I've never heard of that. Most of the time POI is totally random, and just because your mom had it doesn't mean you will have it too. I wouldn't be concerned."" I felt a little reassured, and after all, I was not even trying to get pregnant at the time, so I tried to put it out of my head. One year later, I get a new OB/gyn since my previous one moved on to a new practice. I asked him the same question, and his response was essentially the same. But I still couldn't shake this nagging feeling and would continue to bring it up at my annual visits. Finally he offered me a referral to a genetic counselor. 

&nbsp;

Well, guess what? I found out last fall that I am indeed a Fragile X premutation carrier. And my repeat expansion number is so high that it has a nearly 100% chance of expanding into the full mutation in the next generation.

&nbsp;

Now, I am still not interested in getting pregnant at this exact moment in time. I'm still in school (yes, even after all this time - I'm doing an extended program), and I'm not married. But my boyfriend of 3 years and I really want to get married and have children in the future - preferable when I am in residency and we have a little more money. So right away, we went to a fertility specialist to talk about freezing my eggs to do IVF and PGD in the future. Trying to conceive without IVF & PGD is not an option for us because due to the mutation, we essentially would have a 50/50 chance of having a child with a potentially severe intellectual disability. My workup right off the bat was not reassuring. At age 29, my AMH was only 0.64. My doctor said that she would be THRILLED if we got 10 eggs but that we had to be prepared for a poor outcome. To complicate things, I also had a 6 cm ovarian cyst that we had to contend with before we could start my stim cycle. Finally, if any of you are familiar with the way med school works, you know that 3rd year clerkships are extremely regimented to the point of making it nearly impossible to take time off for multiple doctor visits and procedures. 

&nbsp;

(Can I just say here what a nightmare it was to have to do a rotation in OB/gyn for school while I was going through all this? For a whole month I would literally get off the phone with my doctor in the morning after talking about the status of my cyst and my upcoming stim cycle and my shitty prospects, then have to go into patients' rooms and paste a big fake smile on my face while I rubbed gel on their big pregnant bellies and obtained their fetal heart tones and planned for their deliveries. And at the same time that I was trying to come to grips with the fact that I might never be a mom, I would have to assist in the delivery room. I tried so hard to hide how terrible I felt and how much I resented those women who didn't deserve my resentment, and it was awful and I am so happy that I am done with that rotation and never have to do that ever ever again.)

&nbsp;

We had to wait a couple months until I had a little vacation, but finally I did the stim cycle and retrieval. We did a microdose lupron cycle because my doctor said it is better for women with diminished ovarian reserve. I had 7 promising follicles on day 4, 6 on day 6... eventually down to 5 decent looking follicles on day of retrieval. That was really hard, watching the numbers go down. And then only 3 mature eggs after retrieval. Into the freezer they went. I can't help thinking, all that money for only 3 eggs? Especially considering that we're assuming that half of my eggs have the Fragile X gene to start with? It has been really difficult coming to grips with the thought that this all might have been for nothing. I know there is still a chance with 3 eggs, but... it's not good.

&nbsp;

In addition to the usual infertility nightmare stuff I've already described, here are some additional things causing me extreme anxiety:

&nbsp;

Finances - the insurance provided to me by the medical school does not cover any kind of infertility treatments whatsoever. Everything for my cycle was out of pocket (i.e. on a credit card with an intro offer that we are slowly trying to pay off.) We don't have the means right now to do another cycle. I am on a measley stipend to get through school, and my boyfriend was laid off about 5 months ago and only recently got a new job, so our finances have been really tight. A crazy bright spot is that we found out his new job offers coverage for infertility services, but his insurance doesn't actually kick in until March (60 day post-hire period.) We are seriously considering having a shotgun wedding so that I can get on his insurance to do more stim cycles. Which is crazy. It's crazy right? We have actually been planning on getting married, but not for a year or two, when I'm done with school and we could have a big traditional wedding. And now we are considering just going to the courthouse within the next month for the insurance benefits. I want to laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of it all.

&nbsp;

Which leads me to family - my mom is 100% on board with me doing IVF and is gunning for me to do another stim cycle. She really wants to give me money to help out, but my dad is super Catholic and against IVF. Discarding embryos, even if they have Fragile X, is against his religious belief that all life is sacred and needs to be protected. This disagreement has obviously been causing a lot of tension in the family. It's breaking my heart because I love my dad very much - he's actually a great dad and I still consider him one of my best friends - and now I feel like I can't talk with him at all about this horrible thing in my life. Whenever I call home, we have to dance around this issue and it has honestly become very painful and makes me feel even more lonely than I already do. He has accepted the egg freezing (because at least they're not fertilized embryos yet), but he know's what's coming. (And can you imagine how much he would flip out if we got married in a courthouse? Again, I'm almost laughing at the craziness of it all.)

&nbsp;

Finally, I am dealing with a lot of anger. I am especially angry with my current OB/gyn and the one before him, because if they had known a little more about Fragile X premutations (which are NOT a rare cause of POI), I would have gone through this 4-5 years ago, and who knows how many more eggs we could have gotten back then?

&nbsp;

I am trying to stay positive. 3 good eggs is better than none. Also my boyfriend has been incredibly supportive during all of this, and I really think this experience has brought us closer together. We also have a couple of good friends who are genuinely interested in our progress and ask us questions about it (instead of a lot of people who throw out that ""I'm here if you need to talk"" garbage cop-out without ever actually asking me how I'm doing. I'm sure you guys know what I mean.) We all had dinner together the night before my retrieval and they asked me lots of questions about the stim cycle and how the retrieval would go. Then the next day they messaged me wanting to know how it went. It felt really nice, because until recently I have been really tight lipped about this whole experience.

However, I’m worried that we won’t be left with enough sperm to make IUI worthwhile, since it is to my understanding that unless you are doing ICSI, you actually need hundreds of sperm to bind to the egg in order for one to get in. </p>

<p>My biggest question is does anyone have any experience on your post wash numbers using Zymot vs. your post wash numbers using density gradient/swim up? Does Zymot typically weed out more sperm than other washing methods? Or will we be left with about the same number of total motile sperm post wash no matter which washing method we choose?</p>

So I was diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Failure about 10 years ago. I was 24, and while it was a bit of a shock, I was at a place in my life where the possibility of children was soooo far off my radar (I was young, single, poor, and not emotionally ready for family) that the diagnosis was not really an earth-shatterer.

Fast forward to a few years ago, I’m blissfully married, more financially stable, with a man who very much wants children and I very much do, too. After several years of flirting with adoption, we eventually decided to try for a genetically “his” child, and started meeting with our RE about a year ago. Since I already had a clear diagnosis, we were able to dive straight in to the wonderful/horrible world of donor eggs. We (clearly naievly) thought that having finally made the BIG decision to go this route, that things would move along rapidly.

How freaking wrong we were.

It feels like the process of finding a donor is totally IMPOSSIBLE. I’m sure this is because of a combination of being both very “picky” about finding someone who is a good match (physically, and personality-wise) with me, and the fact that I have some apparently not-super-common physical characteristics. Our clinic has a truly shitty list of donors at least as far as what we’re looking for, and while we’ve found a few promising donors at an agency, the exponentially higher cost of going that route is really hard for my husband to swallow. 

We’re also running into communication issues with our clinic: while our actual RE is great and generous, the staff at her office in various roles makes dealing with anything a huge freaking headache. Given that we plan to move across the country in the summer, we’re seriously considering dumping this clinic and just starting from scratch when we move....BUT HOLY LORD the idea of purposefully stalking for ANOTHER six months before we even BEGIN seems too terrible for words right now.

On top of all this, the prospect of impending pregnancy (in combination with a bunch of other unrelated to infertility factors) have caused my previously well-managed eating disorder to rear its ugly head, and I’m now dealing with simultaneously trying to get my body/mind healthy enough to carry, AND all the usual treatment/infertility/egg donor logistics and crap. It just feels like SO MUCH to deal with, and right now both sides of it feel utterly hopeless. 

Anyway, just looking for hope/commiseration/help/stories/anything to make it seem like this is possible, worth it, and that it will some day be OVER. 

Also, hi. Nice to meet you all.

Introductory post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ed8cp3/intro_from_a_medical_mystery_no_ovulation_for_1/). Long story short, it seems my OB/GYN has wasted nearly a year by taking forever to do a (non-CD3) blood test and scan, and concluding that everything looks normal. Today, the results of my second opinion scan/CD3 bloodwork from an RE (which I insisted on, even though I was told to just “relax” and wait for my cycle to come back after quitting BC) are in: I have anovulatory “lean” PCOS. LH/FSH ratio nearly 3:1 and I have polycystic ovaries. AMH 5.9. Testosterone 1.8 nmol/l. Now, I can’t get in for a consultation on next steps/treatment for another month.

I can’t believe it took this long to get diagnosed - I want to rip my hair out! It doesn’t help that since I was worried hypothalamic amenorrhea might be playing a role in my lack of periods (since I was a regular runner with a history of dieting) I cut out cardio/started eating more and have gained nearly 10lbs in the last 5 months, which now seems to have been completely unnecessary and maybe even counterproductive. 

Anyway, since I have to wait for another appointment, I’ve been googling the heck out of lean PCOS, but of course this has led to more questions than answers. I am curious to hear about your experiences with ovulation induction, etc… is Metformin something to ask about? TI versus IUI? Anything I should be doing diet-wise?

Dreading the prospect of paying fully out of pocket, we were desperate to find a way to get additional infertility coverage.  

In 2019, my wife was on her employer’s United plan, so we naturally wondered if switching to my employers plan, which also happened to be United, would give her a new lifetime infertility maximum.  

My initial internet searches didn’t fill me with confidence.  Maybe I wasn’t reading the right forums, but the consensus seemed to be that the infertility max wouldn’t reset by switching from her company’s United plan to my United plan.  The justification being that she was still using the same insurance company and therefore subject to the same lifetime maximum.  Luckily I continued my research with our infertility provider’s billing team and United customer reps, because this morning (after having switched to my plan) my wife met with United’s preauthorization nurse who confirmed she has used zero of her 30k medical max and zero of her 20k Rx coverage.   

We are absolutely relieved, and I really wanted to share our experience as a data point for anyone dealing with a similar situation.  That... and I hate United with a passion, so the more you folks can’t get out of them the better!  

For full disclosure, we are located in Illinois, so please confirm that laws are not different in your state.  At least for Illinois, my conclusions are as follows:

1.	Switching from one insurance company to a completely different one will absolutely result in a new lifetime infertility maximum

2.	When switching from a spouse’s plan to the other person’s (different employers), the lifetime infertility maximum also resets… even if the insurance company is the same.

3.	Changing jobs, would trigger a new lifetime maximum with the new employer’s plan.

4.	Insurance companies try to scare people by calling it a LIFETIME infertility maximum.  A more accurate description should be a maximum employer plan infertility maximum.  

*** Please note that these are my experiences with United, but these are major decisions (financially and emotionally), so please do your own due diligence to confirm before making a plan change decisions of your own ***

What I can not speak to is what happens if you simply select a different plan offered by your employer without changing insurance company (i.e. from your employer’s high deductible United plan to United’s low deductible plan option).  I doubt this would reset things, but it’s worth a call to your infertility provider’s billing office to at least check.

I’d love for others to share their experience, so this post can be a resource for others going forward.  If any one has had any conflicting experiences, please let me know and I will edit my post accordingly.  Also, I’m happy to answer any questions, so I can help clarify anything in my confusing, long-winded message.

261,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I wanted to make a somewhat positive post: A tribute to my wife.

For most of the last decade, my wife worked as a foster care case manager.  She worked with kids who had been removed from their biological parents' care because they were subjected to neglect, abuse and/or endangerment.  Her job was to ensure their well-being and strive for a ""permanency,"" which means (ideally) reunification with the biological parents; if not, then adoption or guardianship.

She had to visit with biological parents to make sure they were doing what they needed to do in order to regain custody of their children, ensure the children were doing well in their foster homes, coordinate services, and attend court hearings where it was decided whether to reunify children with their parents or terminate the parents' rights.

This job is widely perceived to be low-paying, highly stressful and extremely demanding.  Most people either use it as a brief stepping stone to better things in their career, or burn out after a year or two.

She did it for almost **nine years.**  This involved taking calls in the middle of the night to go sit with foster kids in the hospital, having to cancel plans and leave events because of a work emergency, driving halfway across the state on a regular basis, and be threatened and yelled at and called names.

All through this, I think I saw her cry once.  I can remember another incident or two where she recalled crying, but that was it.  Contrast with me, who gets emotional when I give a poorly-received PowerPoint presentation.

She may have her quirks, but on things that matter, I really think she's one of the toughest people I know.

And, oblivious as I am, I don't think I've been fully appreciative of this until we started IVF.

She's gotten, by my count, over 100 shots from me -- probably more -- plus lots of blood draws, plenty of uncomfortable transvaginal ultrasounds (with and without fluid injected inside her uterus), a painful procedure where they inflated a balloon in her uterus to squirt dye into her Fallopian tubes, a painful scraping of her uterine lining... and I think her biggest complaint might have been about my facial expression when I saw blood on the ultrasound probe once.

When the egg retrieval left her in near-crippling pain on every bump in the road, I asked her if we should cancel our vacation (I had gotten trip insurance just in case); she said no.

After the embryo transfer, when she woke up in the middle of the night with crippling cramps that had her rolled up in a ball, I kept suggesting we go to the ER; she said she was fine.

When she was losing the pregnancy over Thanksgiving weekend (which we didn't know at the time, although we feared it due to her symptoms), she wanted to go Christmas tree shopping.

When she learned the news from the nurse that she had miscarried, she called me and said ""Well, it's not the news we were hoping for.""  Meanwhile, I could barely even speak when relaying the news to our parents.

When her cousin brought her new baby over on Christmas, I started to get a little teared up watching her feed the baby; she fed her without giving away any sense of sadness.

When we went to visit our friends in the hospital after they gave birth to a child three weeks after our miscarriage, I was basically hysterical and had to take something to calm me down; she rocked the baby and didn't bat an eye.

When she watched an all-day marathon of *Sex and the City* that heavily featured an eerily relevant (to us) infertility plotline, I was getting teary-eyed just listening to it while doing other  things; she watched it just fine.

I think I've seen her cry about it four times over the month and a half since our loss.  For myself, I've lost count.

But I know it's bugging her.  She keeps waking up in the middle of the night.  She doesn't like talking about it with most people.  She did ask for me to leave the room when I was on the phone with someone who was having a loud conversation about the fun things someone was doing with their children.

But, she carried on like a champion and has shown no signs of stopping.

262,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband and I are dealing with infertility of the ""unexplained"" type. I am concerned that I might actually have lean PCOS although my current RE has decided I don't meet all of the diagnostic criteria. I'm hoping that there might be a few folks out there who have dealt with my symptoms, might have some suggestions on additional testing.

In my late teens and early twenties, I was very athletic, thin, and started to get bad cramps and an increase in facial hair that my mom was convinced was genetic because she went through the same thing. I ended up going on birth control prescribed by my doctor in college, for about 8 years on and off (from about age 18 to 26) and this made my symptoms (excess hair, period cramps) marginally improve. Eventually in my mid-twenties, I decided I didn't want to be on medication anymore, so I quit birth control and didn't really notice any changes except that my cramps got increasingly worse with time over the years.

Now, at 35 years old, a decade later, we are trying to conceive, and after about a year of trying naturally, we just enlisted the help of an RE a couple of months ago. After some diagnostic testing, it turns out that I have a very high AMH of 15.38 ng/ml  coupled with low (but just within normal range) testosterone and DHEA-S, FSH/LH one cycle was approx 5/7, another cycle was approx 5/10. My antral follicle counts for the past two cycles were 30 and 24 (aren't these counts quite high for my age and indicative of PCO?), I apparently ovulate regularly but with varying cycle length (28 to 37 days). (Additionally, but perhaps unrelated, it turns out I have an endometrioma on my right ovary roughly 2.5cm diameter).  I should also note that I remain thin at 5'-7"" and 125lbs and naturally athletic, and within the past few months developed slight lower cheek and neck cystic acne after years of clear skin.

After the diagnostic testing, my RE has yet to give either of us a diagnosis; she told me that although I lean towards PCOS, she wouldn't diagnose me and I'm wondering if her reservation is due to the lower androgen levels. She proposed a medicated and monitored cycle of IUI because of my ultra high AMH. The cycle consisted of Day 3 US showing 24 follicles, Letrozole 2.5mg days 3-7, Day 9 monitoring showing 2 mature follicles (I believe around 18mm), followed by an Ovidrel trigger shot evening of Day 9, subsequent IUI on Day 11, and ovulation confirmed by BBT on morning of Day 12. We are now in the 2-week wait, and as patient as I want to be, I can't help but do additional research on our particular case.

Side note to this fertility discussion is that one of my husband's sperm analyses (and we are awaiting a followup analysis) showed 0 morphology, but otherwise normal range scores.

My questions for lean PCOS folks out there: did any of you exhibit increased facial hair and higher testosterone in your teens and early twenties, followed by a substantial decrease in your early thirties, but persistantly high AMH and AFC?

I’m at really early stages with this journey and just having tests at the moment. 

A bit of background is that I was diagnosed officially with endometriosis almost 5 years ago. I also live in the UK.

I have been referred to an infertility clinic 2 months ago after trying for over a year and having no success. 

I have had x2 blood tests which indicated I wasn’t ovulating (1 referred by gp and the other by clinic) 

Ultra sound was normal.

I had my HyCosy exam today which showed my right ovary and right Fallopian tube are great.
My left ovary also great. 
However then the examiner paused for a while and said ‘just waiting for the dye to run through the left Fallopian tube but it looks healthy’

It took a couple of minutes before he eventually said the dye had started to run through but very slowly. 

Can anyone explain what this could mean? He didn’t say it was blocked and said I would get results from my consultation in Feb.

<p>What questions should I come to my RE prepared with? We already know we’re back on track to IVF, since that’s where we were before I got pregnant. What else do we need to know relative to that treatment plan, knowing we’ve already done the preliminary testing a year ago?</p>

My wife and I have been married for 18 years.  We both want children and started trying to get pregnant about a year after being married.  We took what I believe is the normal path to resolve our lack of children:

Unprotected sex for 2 years.  Appointment with OB/GYN for clomid,

Between our two HCG tests, my wife was awoken in the middle of the night with extreme lower pelvic pain (she thought it was more towards her vagina than her uterus, but wasn’t 100% sure).  It lasted about 30 minutes, but it was bad enough that we were going to go to the ER if it lasted any longer.

Our second HCG test showed a nice growth rate, so we thought we were good, but that night the pain returned for about the same amount of time.  There was some very light spotting.

Three days later, she started having duller (but still pretty bad), longer lasting (basically all day) pain of a different nature accompanied by much heavier spotting.  We went on to lose the pregnancy; after discontinuing medications, she began full flow.

So, we saw it all as related... until, three weeks later, my wife was woken up again with 10 minutes of the same, curled-up-in-a-ball lower pelvic pain (this time radiating to the right side) and some light spotting (despite being on the BCP).

The nurse wrote it off as uterine expansion/contraction — it was too early for an ectopic to manifest itself, and of course the pain returned well after the loss — and Google doesn’t show much.

We asked our RE, and she seemed puzzled.  Obviously none of the tests have shown any cause for this (my wife has had a recent saline ultrasound and hysteroscopy), and it seemed (based on her reaction) that this wasn’t something she had heard much about —- although she herself admitted having the same symptoms of an unknown origin during a failed IVF cycle.

The only other data point I have is that our RE has endometriosis, and my wife has a blocked tube of unknown origin (possibly endometriosis, barring no other obvious explanation like PID or abdominal surgery).

But again, my wife never had this pain before becoming pregnant.

I'm unfamiliar with IVF, but I took pictures of my clinic's price sheet and I'm wondering what it all means and what I should expect per cycle. I have an appointment to go over this all with my doctor in a month, but I'm impatient. 


Under ""retrieval"" it has:
▪︎Egg retrieval $2000
▪︎Anesthesia $250
▪︎Ultrasound for egg aspiration $400
▪︎Egg identification $600
▪︎Egg culture day 0-3 $1000
▪︎ICSI $1500
▪︎Biopsy embryos $1500
▪︎Biopsy embryos 6+ $1700

Under ""transfer"" it has:

▪︎Ultrasound for transfer $300
▪︎Embryo transfer $700
▪︎Embryo thaw $750
▪︎Hatching $300
▪︎Egg culture day 4+ $500

▪︎Hygiene kit $30
▪︎Surgical tray $175
▪︎Injection fee $15
▪︎Methotrexate __ ML $35/50mg
▪︎Outside monitoring fee $50



Which of these are done more than once per cycle? 
Is the price of ICSI for all eggs retrieved or per egg?
What is the biopsy? Is this PGS testing or something different?
Is embryo freeze/yearly storage per embryo? 
Does this include all of the meds I would need per cycle?

I have been active on TFAB and more recently on TTC30. I wanted to introduce myself as I expect to be more active in this group moving forward and seek out some advice.

First the TL;DR — I found out today that my mom likely had undiagnosed endometriosis. So I’m wondering if I have silent endo, my only symptom being infertility. If so, how does that change my testing and treatment plan?

The details/introduction:

My husband and I have been TTC unsuccessfully for exactly a year. (We’re on cycle 13 now.) We had a consultation with an RE this week. (This sub’s wiki was amazing to prepare. 🙌🏻)

My husband’s October SA came back with strong numbers, save morphology at 3%. Because it’s an isolated result, my RE isn’t particularly concerned. 

I’ll undergo testing next cycle, including CD3 blood work and an SHG. Based on SHG, she said she might progress to HSG that same day. At that point, we expect to have a specific diagnosis.

I have light-to-medium, two-sometimes-three-day periods with cycles that last 26-29 days and an 11-day LP. (I get positive OPKs between CD15-19, normally CD16.) I do spot on either side of my period, as early as six days before once, so she’ll look for polyps with SHG. She said nothing in my medical background indicates a need for an HSG. (I haven’t had any surgeries and I have virtually no period symptoms, beyond headaches.)

She did a vaginal ultrasound during the consult (that I found fascinating, as an aside). I was on CD8 and had a 14mm follicle our of my right ovary that she said will drop this cycle’s chosen egg. She called both ovaries “beautiful” and nothing appeared problematic. My lining was 4.4, also a fine measurement for that part of my cycle, she said. 

That info/plan all sounds good and well to me. However.

I found out today that my mom likely had endometriosis, undiagnosed bc of the state of health care at the time and how (un)seriously docs took women’s pain. So I’m wondering if I have silent endo, my only symptom being infertility.

My mom had painful periods and heavy bleeding and was getting her period every two or three weeks. She was getting anemic as a result and on iron shots. They discovered benign tumors/cysts in her uterus. She had a hysterectomy. (She was 38 at the time and had had three children by then. I’m 30.)

I didn’t know any of this ahead of my appointment, so I obviously couldn’t tell my RE. When should I bring it up and should I now request HSG? (Right now I plan to call on CD1 to schedule the testing we discussed.) How hard should I push if she doesn’t think an HSG is necessary? Is there different/additional testing that would be reasonable given this information?

I am a bit disheartened. I have three frozen embryos, two of which are PGS normal and one which is missing a copy of Chromosome 2, which is incompatible for life. For the past year, I have blissfully been thinking we still have two more good chances to have a baby.

At my appt on Tuesday, we discovered that our remaining two PGS embryos are 3AB and 2BC. So not great. But especially not the 2BC. 

I was on Tricare last year (no infertility coverage) but this year I am on my work insurance plan which thankfully has infertility coverage (although I am $7,000 away from my max allotment). So I asked my husband, and he agrees, that perhaps we should transfer the 2BC first, for a couple reasons. 

While I am working full time at this company and paying for the insurance, it makes more sense to hedge our loss: if we transfer the 2BC  this year and it doesn't work, we can transfer the 3AB a few months afterward, still in the yer 2020, so it will be covered. After that we are all done with embryos, and I will not be coming back for another (third) round of IVF stims. I'm done after these transfers.

If we transfer the 3AB first and it takes, then hallelujah, but then we are paying for another 2 years (min) of embryo storage (which is $700/year), and when we come back to do the transfer of the 3BC embryo (because I will NOT leave my PGS normal embryo without at least trying), we will be paying cash as I will no longer be working full time and have that insurance. 

So it make sense, right? Except that now I feel very discouraged mentally. Like I'm preparing for this next transfer but I shouldn't really get too excited because it is statistically less likely. And then all the pressure will be on the next/last transfer of the 3AB. And that will be so much pressure, I'm not sure I could handle it because nothing is guaranteed. Although I guess I'm not sure it would be any different if we did the 3AB first - then if it didn't take, I guess I would be more or less accepting that we aren't having a baby in 2021, and I would go through the motions with the 2BC just because. I wouldn't have to hold my breath as long.

319,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,

I found this sub about a year ago and have been lurking since. 


I think I am in such early phases of all this that the science here makes my head spin. 

history and current status:

33 year old female. 
3 years ago I got a Mirena
2 years ago my period stopped (as they say happens on mirena) so I thought nothing of it. 
1 year ago I started having really bad hormonal chin acne and my dermatologist recommended I take the Mirena out. 
I clearly remember the nurse taking out the IUD and saying “congrats you are fertile now!” 

Only I wasn’t. My period did not return. I never started ovulating again, started having hot flashes, and got wicked insomnia. 

Fast forward a few months, big blood tests and a 3 hour reproductive endocrinologist appoint let later I am told a few odd things. 

1) my estradiol is an 8 at the age of 32
2) all other hormones are perfectly normal and my reserve is “excellent” according to the doc. 
3) ruled out all known causes: not PCOS, no endometriosis, no tumors, no brain lesions, not early onset menopause,  
4) ultrasound showed 20 follicles ready to do their job  but none were making estrogen. 
5) no known cause 

(Small heartache moment. Same day I got my estrogen results and had the talk with my doc my best friend found out she was pregnant with just getting off birth control and timing things in an app. One time! One. Time.)

Anyways back to the facts...

Endochronologist put me on birth control to get my estrogen up because i was having such bad side effects. 
They also told me to be on it for 3 months to see if it would “jump start” my system.  

I got on birth control and my period returned. I know it was because of the pills but I was hopeful that this would continue once I got off them. 

A week ago I was supposed to get my first period while being off birth control. It did not come and I had another hot flash yesterday. That was pretty clear to me that my estrogen didn’t return. 

So here I am with ovaries full of follicles ready to do their job but no ovulation to speak of. 
So the husband and I are just in limbo now. Can’t even  “try” for a baby if I’m not ovulating so what do we do? 

Next steps are fuzzy as I have to go back to the Endochronologist. 

Besides getting pregnant my mind is filled with “why is this happening? What is wrong with me medically?? Why does no one care about the why of the situation?” 
It seems that the doctors don’t care to find why a healthy woman suddenly is not making estrogen but are more than willing to start me on treatments. 

The combo of uncertainty about being able to conceive and worry about my own health can be overwhelming. 

So anyways. Hello everyone.

It seems that the doctors don’t care to find why a healthy woman suddenly is not making estrogen but are more than willing to start me on treatments. </p>

<p>The combo of uncertainty about being able to conceive and worry about my own health can be overwhelming. </p>

<p>So anyways. Hello everyone. 
My heart aches for each of you and I am grateful to have a place like this for us all to lean on each other. You are all so strong and are going through so much. I wish I could hug everyone here.</p>

321,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"January 21st will mark two years since I had a miscarriage. I would really appreciate some advise on what to request from my doctors to try and get pregnant again or to get answers towards our infertility. 

My gynecologist history:
We have been trying to get pregnant since 2012 when we got married (I was 18 years old) but even before that we weren’t preventing a pregnancy from happening. I went to my first gynecologist in 2015 - 2016 because we hadn’t gotten pregnant and I was having really painful first day of my period (this lasted from about 2012 - 2017 never got a explanation why or how it stopped). They said I was young and we could try birth control for a few months and when I got off of it we’d get pregnant. That didn’t work. I also got tested for STD’s during that time and results were good. 

After a couple more appointments with them and getting no help at all I tried a different gynecologist (2nd) in 2016 - 2017. They only wanted to test my thyroid and STD’s and everything came back good. They then tested my husband sperm and it came back he had a very high count but also had a lot that were mutated. They said we still should of gotten pregnant by that point though. So they recommended doing a IUI. We did that once and it didn’t work. The next month they recommended we do a HSG. The radiologist gave confusing messages like my cervix was angled weird and had a hard time getting my uterus to expand and asked if I had ever had pelvic inflammatory disease, which I said not that I ever knew of. The results came back normal and that my tubes were clear. My next appointment with the gynecologist (2nd) I brought up what the radiologist had mentioned and he said we still should of got pregnant before and didn’t seem concerned at all by those remarks. Then his next words were something like ‘Well your test comes back normal, I can’t tell you why you can’t get pregnant, you should probably look into a specialist’ but didn’t recommend where I should go. I asked to get my hormones tested and then he flat out refused because I have a regular period. We argued back and forth for a bit and he still refused. Five months after that in November 2017 I got pregnant naturally. I will be honest and say I was on a super strict low carb / no sugar diet at the time to lose a little bit of weight but as soon as I found out I was pregnant I went to a normal healthy diet as best I could. 

I went to a different obgyn /gynecologist (3rd) because I wasn’t fond of the 2nd one. I gave the run down of our infertility journey up to that point to the nurse Practioner and they didn’t seem worried at my first appointment around my 9 week mark. Unfortunately, when I was almost 13 weeks I miscarried at the ER 2 days before my next appointment. It took me a couple of weeks to feel mentally ready to call again but the hospital and the gynecologist (3rd) gave me zero information on what happened. So my next appointment with the gynecologist (3rd) I basically tried to get my hormones tested again and they refused because my periods were still regular. I then asked him what I should do next and he didn’t give me any ideas only saying everything is normal with us and we should get pregnant but recommended I take chaste berry to regulate any hormone issues naturally if there were any. I took that for about 4 months until my bottles ran out. I also asked for another HSG when I was leaving the last appointment since it might have helped the first time. I had that done in December 2018 and it came back normal. I didn’t do anything fertility related in 2019 but was hoping it would just happen naturally again. If anything I would say both mine and my husbands sex drive has died down. We weren’t focusing on getting pregnant in 2019 so it wasn’t that we stressed ourselves out over it but I think we’ve both gotten depressed and worn out of not getting pregnant. We looked into a fertility clinic in 2019 but they wanted to sell our information in the fine print of the paperwork so we backed out. I would like to make another appointment with my gynecologist but I don’t know if I should find another fertility clinic and just start going there. 

So I would like any advise on what should I do next? I see other people talking about getting their egg quality tested and ultrasounds done of their uterus quality. I haven’t had any of that done and doctors refuse to test hormones on me no matter what I say. So what should I do? What should I request to have done? I want to get pregnant again so badly but I’m just so worn out mentally from not getting any idea of what’s wrong. I know we haven’t technically done a lot of things fertility related but it’s just a lot to take in and I really would like to get a game plan on what I should be working towards because after two years I’m losing my hope that it will happen again naturally. If I need to explain or clarify anything further please just let me know.

We got our results back today from the Anora test we had from our D&C on 12/27/19. No chromosomal abnormalities. This just made me feel worse - it means we still don't have any answers.

In the last 2.5 years we have had 3 miscarriages and we don't have a single clue as to why.

A little info on each pregnancy:

1st: Conceived naturally shortly after my bc was taken out. Miscarried on 8/1/17 at 6w5d. It was anatural miscarriage and I passed everything overnight. No testing was done as it was our firstpregnancy and the OB/GYN didn't think there was anything to it - it was simply 1 in 4 chance.

2nd: Conceived through FET 1.5 years after our first pregnancy (IVF #2). Had a subchorionic bleed.Miscarried on 6/3/19 at 6w3d. Given medication to help the miscarriage along, instead it stoppedit and I had to wait another 2 weeks for it to happen naturally again. I had blood work done but they didn't find anything.

3rd: Conceived through a fresh transfer (IVF #4). Had another subchorionic bleed and baby had a lowHR. RE said there were 2 yolk sacs and that the baby wouldn't survive. We had to wait for theheartbeat to stop before we could do anything. On 12/23/19 no heartbeat detected. D&C on 12/27. I had blood work done and all came back normal.

Every test we've done has come back normal. SA - above average, egg reserves - normal, no blocked tubes, no preexisting conditions (pcos, endo, etc.), thyroid funtion - normal, IGG/IGM - normal (negative). During each one of our cycles my numbers are all perfect. We did 6 rounds of medicated cycles with timed intercourse with no luck. They said because the SA was normal and I ovulate on my own that IUI wouldn't really better our chances at all. During our IVF cycles all my blood work comes back normal. My RE seems to be somewhat stumped as to what is causing all this. We have an appointment on 1/14/2020 to discuss what our options are to move forward. To be honest I am terrified that they are going to tell us I'm incapable of carrying a baby to term. At this point I am just so tired and frustrated with having no answers and I don't know what to do. I don't even know what else is left for us to try.

Edit: Forgot to mention, my husband and I have both had genetic testing - he is a carrier for 1 recessive thing and I am a carrier for 2 recessive things, but they do not overlap so no risk of the baby having them. We also had chromosomal testing and both of us came back completely normal.

Update: Thank you for all the suggestions! I plan to ask my RE about testing for clotting disorders and a potential Laproscopy/hysteroscopy. And potentially doing PGS testing in the future (although the results from Anora said this one was chromosomally normal).",t2_36kq39c1,False,,0,False,D&C Results Are Back,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_emjmwb,False,dark,1.0,,public,10,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},TW: Miscarriage/Loss,False,10,,False,self,1578680716.0,,[],{},,True,,1578648642.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>**warning: long post**</p>
