Everything was normal. 

This should be good, right? But our RE still thinks our losses were genetic, random chromosomal abnormalities. And now that I’ve had 4 losses, my chance of miscarriage each time is up to 50%. 

Our options now are to continue trying naturally, do a round of fertility drugs and insemination to hopefully get more eggs which increases the odds of a healthy egg, or do IVF with ISCI and PGD. Only the IVF reduces the chance of miscarriage. If a transfer is successful, my RE says the chance of loss would only be 10-12% as opposed to the 50% chance with natural conception or insemination. 

I don’t want to keep having miscarriages. But round 1 of IVF with ISCI and PGD would be almost $20k. Our insurance covers up to 10k but still. That’s so much money. And its not guaranteed to work. 

I feel like throwing up. 

Edit/Update: I was incorrect, we would be doing PGS not PGD. My husband and I have discussed it, and also talked to my MIL who is willing to assist financially.

I’m 35, AMH 0.1, FSH 5, follicle count 3. DOR. 

I just had two egg freezing consults and need help choosing a clinic. 

Clinic A

PRO: is significantly less expensive because it offers a 3 cycle egg freezing package.  This is huge for me bc due to my pitiful AMH and low follicle count I will most likely need several rounds.  I am using money from my IRA to pay for this and I’m scared that I won’t have enough money to pay for the necessary amount of rounds to get enough good eggs.

CON: this clinic has two locations, but only one doctor.  So they do “batching” which I guess is clumping all of the egg retrievals in one day by putting the patients on birth control pills.  

Is batching a bad idea?  From what I’ve read, everyone’s cycle is different and timing is everything.  

The other clinic I’m considering (USC fertility) does not do batching.  They are open 7 days a week and work according to your cycle. The downside is that there are several doctors and you will get seen by the doctor that is available.  It’s also more expensive.

Started the process and did my first ER got 6 blasts total and xfer in October. Took a break for the holidays. Then back to back FETs in feb and March.

I planned ahead this time. Just in case. I took today off and told my boss everything. I told her that if today was negative that I needed the rest of the week off because I AM DONE. NO MORE INFERTILITY FOR THIS GIRL.

I've been lurking for the past few days and have found my (highly labile) emotions well represented here so thought it was time for an intro. A friend of mine who is unfortunately on a similarly shitty IF journey recommended this sub and I have found it incredibly helpful.

I'm 34 and TTC for almost 3 years. I saw an RE about 15 months ago and was diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve so boarded the IVF train based on their recommendations. I am now coming off a failed IVF cycle/canceled FET and it has pretty much gutted me. I am doing the whole DHEA, CoQ10 thing and my RE seems to be satisfied with my microdose Lupron protocol without plans to adjust it. I have had 4 cycles that have yielded zero embryos (relatively few follicles, fewer fertilized, and a number of aneuploid embryos), and have banked the very few I produced from my successful 2 cycles. For some reason this last failure has completely unraveled me and I am avoiding everybody (including my wonderfully supportive family and close friends), weeping a lot, and not interested in doing anything. Obviously my husband and I are alarmed at this change in my mental health and he has contacted a therapist he found on RESOLVE at my request.

In general, I am the kind of person who copes with negativity and loss by reminding myself of all that I have (don't worry, I'm not the #blessed type). Right now, despite my incredible partner and support system, financial ability to pursue IF therapy, the fact that I don't live in a war-torn part of the world, and many other positives in my life - it all. fucking. sucks.

I am trying to come to terms with the idea that I may not be able to have my own bio children based on the number of embryos I have and suspicion that my embryo quality is also not optimal. This been harder than I thought it would be. All those years I joked that I hoped my kids wouldn't have my family's big nose are hitting a little too close to home. At the same time, for the sake of my sanity and because I feel time slipping away I decided that I am going to try one more IVF cycle, plan for FET no matter the results, and start looking for donors. I have a long way to go before I make my peace with this happening so far removed from my terms but the simple decision to put an end date to ER is a step in that direction.

I am sure so many of you are feeling this awful mix of sadness, frustration, anger, and guilt and am very grateful to have a group to connect and empathize with.

41,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all, would have posted in the dailies but this seems like an oddly specific situation and isn't addressed in the faqs.

Feeling totally confused and overwhelmed, thought maybe you all would have some insights on my current situation:

I was informed almost 4 weeks ago that I was miscarrying after my first FET (at 5 ish weeks hch went from 700 to 200, then 100 two days later).  This sucked but I grieved and was looking forward to next steps. As per usual, my clinic monitored my hcg levels and we were all frustrated with my slowly decreasing levels (took another week to drop to 50). However, hcg started creeping back up. First to 57, then 100, 150, 190 - all 2-5 days apart. 

Last week (when hcg was at 150) my RE informed me this officially counts as an non-viable pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) and the treatment plan is as follows: check hcg and ultrasound every few days until hcg levels hit 2000 or they see something on ultrasound to help diagnose location. Then we'd proceed to d&c and/or methotrexate. 

However, my next check 4 days later showed hcg at 190 and nothing on ultrasound. At this rate, if nothing is seen on ultrasound and the rise rate continues, it would be approximately 17 more weeks before surgery is an option (that seems cruel, certainly they won't make me wait that long for surgery?). And I'm restricted from exercise and sex until this resolves because of the fair chance this could be ectopic.

I know the most likely outcome is that my body will naturally miscarry, at some point. However, I want to move forward so badly, and I'm really struggling with the uncertainty and the idea of having to carry a nonviable/potentially dangerous pregnancy and be limited in my ability to work out or have sex or feel normal-ish for what could be weeks-months more. It's already been a month and I'm going crazy. Unfortunately my RE (who I really like) has been pretty evasive other than advising taking a wait-and-see approach.

Has anyone had a similar experience and/or does anyone know anything more about PULs? Looking for any info that could shed some light on what I should expect.

I wanted to pass along this opportunity for an IVF clinical trial at Fertility Center of Illinois (and other US locations -- see below). I contacted the study coordinator with some questions trying to get more info before I posted. One thing I was trying to confirm was whether or not they planned to randomize some participants to a placebo group. The coordinator hasn't gotten back to me about this question in particular, but I *think* I found the study entries on ClinicalTrials.gov (two entries for different age brackets) and if I'm right then there is potential to be assigned to a placebo group. Just something to be aware of if you are looking for the real deal. Not that clinical trials are a guarantee of course, but you know what I mean.  

Anyway, it wasn't immediately clear if I was eligible based on my unclear history with possible endo (there was previously a question as to whether I had endometriomas in the past, which would have been an issue, but I don't think milder endo is a disqualifier), and my planned treatment with my clinic was fast approaching, so I'm not going to pursue it. But hopefully this helps someone out there, especially those without insurance coverage.  

Here's the info from the website:  

https://fcionline.com/our-center/research-studies/

I posted about this over on r/ttcafterloss and got a few helpful responses, but most people recommended I post about this over on this sub. After two early miscarriages I decided to go get a RPL panel and karyotyping for my husband and I. Results showed a balanced translocation as shown here: t(11;17)(q13;q11.2). My mind was blown to receive an explanation because I know that isn’t always the case, and I was just blaming the losses on my Hashimoto’s despite it being well-controlled for 6+ years.  

While getting answers lessens my anxiety in some ways, I’ve just been reading everything there is to read about BTs and realizing that your options are essentially “roll the dice and hope for the best” or proceed with IVF. 

My gut tells me that I want to take control of the situation now. I’m 26 years old and while I certainly can’t afford IVF just yet, I am able to pick up extra shifts (I’m a L&D RN) very easily. My gut says that with how crushing my losses were, even at 5 weeks, I can’t handle doing that over and over again with the hopes of success. I’ve read the statistics...they aren’t great, even with IVF most BT carriers require ~2-3 rounds and many move onto donor eggs. 

So anyway. This intro is long-winded but I’m feeling the need for some validation I guess? Validation that I’m not crazy for wanting to skip to IVF without risking the pain of loss and/or TFMR.

We've been trying since December 2016. Not long after I lost my left fallopian tube due to an ectopic pregnancy. We waited 6 weeks for my cycle to return and jumped back on the bandwagon. We haven't had a positive test since.

We started testing in February 2018 and I was diagnosed with ""PCO"" which would make sense given my irregular cycles. At this point I also found out I had subclinical hypothyroidism and was pissed my GP (who knew we were trying to conceive) didn't even mention my TSH was too high for the entire first year we were trying... 

We skipped IUI completely and jumped into IVF last September. From what I gathered from my first scan, my ovaries were being stubborn bastards as usual, the follicles were on the smaller side so my doc increased my FSH dose. We ended up with 17 eggs retrieved, 11 mature, 6 fertilised, which resulted in 1 day 5 blast. The FET failed.

I did a couple of cycles on letrozole Jan and Feb which made me ovulate on day 12 both times and gave me a ridiculously long luteal phase (18-20 days!).

I'm currently on the BCP and will start stims for our second (and last) IVF cycle mid April... They are using the same (antagonist) protocol but have increased the dose of FSH from day 1 (last time it was increased on day 4 or 5) and I'll be starting LH from day 1 this time too. I will also be taking letrozole while stimming. I'm worried about egg quality given our results last time! Im not overly confident increasing the doses will improve the result... We don't have the luxury of switching clinics either. I've gone balls to the wall with supplements since our FET failed, at least that way I feel like I've done everything possible for this upcoming cycle.

60,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"In January 2019 we did our first cycle of IVF, which failed. We had our WTF appointment today by phone and I wondered what your opinions would be, and whether I should seek a second opinion. Sorry it's so long, but I wanted to include as much detail as I could. 


Some background on us...

I'm 34, he is 35. Live in Canada. Started TTC in May 2016. After a year we went to an RE in May 2017, who ran all the usual tests, which came back normal for me but the sperm analysis showed low count and low motility for Mr. Proof. We've both been on CoQ10, vitamin D. Also, Prenatal for me and a men's multi for him.
We had one CP from a natural cycle in June 2017. We then tried 4 IUIs which failed and decided to do IVF with ICSI.


As of September 2018...

FSH was 6.00

E2 was 90

AMH was 1.86ng/mL

AFC was 13

TSH was 1.2


My IVF doctor believes I have slight DOR based on the elevated AMH. 


In January we did IVF with estogen patch priming. I started E2 patch in my luteal phase until I got my period. Started stims on cd2: 300 Gonal-F and 150 Luveris. 


Day 5 of stims monitoring showed 17 follicles at 5-10mm; E2 was 690. 


Day 6 E2 was 1148 and I started Cetrotide.


Day 7 ultrasound showed 23 follicles with the biggest between 10-13mm. E2 was 1727.


After this I travelled to my IVF clinic, which is outside my hone province so the monitoring was with a different clinic and they unfortunately didn't give me as much specifics. They didn't tell me what my E2 was, only that it was rising normally. And they only counted the ""good-sized"" follicles so the total number seemed to drop. They counted 14 with a few over 17mm and a bunch more 14-16mm so we went another night of stims. Day 10 counted 11 that were ""full sized"" but a few more just behind so decided on more stims that night then trigger on Day 11. Lining was 12.8mm. 


Egg retrieval went well and we got 15 eggs. We were really happy since the starting AFC was only 13 and we were hoping for 8-10 eggs. They were worried about OHSS so I started Dostinex, but I never really had any symptoms other than bloat which went away after a few days.

We got our fertilization report the next day. 15 eggs retrieved, 15 mature, only 6 fertilized. So only a 40% fertilization rate. 

Then on day 3 we got the call that only 3 remained and only 1 had progressed to an 8 cell embryo of good quality (a 3 out of a possible rating of 5). The other 2 were only 5 cells and rated a 2. We went in that day to transfer the 8 cell and one of the 5 cells. Everything went smoothly at the transfer, but of course it didn't work.


On to the WTF appointment... They said my eggs appeared to be ok on the outside but the low fertilization rate and the fact that so few developed past day 1 and 2 meant that they were not good quality. I knew this would likely be the case, but it was still hard to hear. 


Surprisingly, our sperm numbers were higher than usual. 14 million count. They didn't say what motility (which is frustrating!), just that it was an improvement from before. The only thing Mr Proof had changed was that he gave up drinking for the month before and during my IVF cycle, so I guess that's something for us to consider going forward.


They said the egg issue could have been related to the protocol and that some eggs just prefer one protocol over the other. If we tried again, she would do an agonist protocol with Superfact. But keep the same dose of Gonal-f and luveris since the follicles grew at a nice pace and we got a nice number of eggs that were mature. She also said they would use a Pole Scope when doing ICSI to make sure the sperm was placed in the middle of the egg. (Never heard of this before and I'm wondering why it wasn't used the first time? Any input on this?)


I asked if there's anything I could do to improve my egg quality and she said I could lose some weight. For reference, I'm 200lbs at 5'6. I will try to lose 25-30lbs before our next round and have read It Starts With the Egg and am trying to live by it as best I can. 


I also asked if Mr Proof should see a urologist or do a sperm defragmentation test. She didn't think it was necessary but said we could ask our home RE about it. We have an appointment with the home RE in two weeks so I think I will based on studies I've read on this board. It won't hurt anyway. Given the improved sperm count, we will probably keep off the alcohol and do another couple IUIs. If no success, we'll go back for IVF#2 in the fall.


If anyone read through all that, thank you!!! Just wanted to run this by anyone who's interested and see if it the doctor's conclusions and advice sound about right?

<p>Egg retrieval went well and we got 15 eggs. We were really happy since the starting AFC was only 13 and we were hoping for 8-10 eggs. They were worried about OHSS so I started Dostinex, but I never really had any symptoms other than bloat which went away after a few days.</p>

<p>We got our fertilization report the next day. 15 eggs retrieved, 15 mature, only 6 fertilized. So only a 40% fertilization rate. </p>

<p>Then on day 3 we got the call that only 3 remained and only 1 had progressed to an 8 cell embryo of good quality (a 3 out of a possible rating of 5). The other 2 were only 5 cells and rated a 2. We went in that day to transfer the 8 cell and one of the 5 cells. Everything went smoothly at the transfer, but of course it didn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>On to the WTF appointment... They said my eggs appeared to be ok on the outside but the low fertilization rate and the fact that so few developed past day 1 and 2 meant that they were not good quality. I knew this would likely be the case, but it was still hard to hear. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, our sperm numbers were higher than usual. 14 million count. They didn&#39;t say what motility (which is frustrating!), just that it was an improvement from before. The only thing Mr Proof had changed was that he gave up drinking for the month before and during my IVF cycle, so I guess that&#39;s something for us to consider going forward.</p>

<p>They said the egg issue could have been related to the protocol and that some eggs just prefer one protocol over the other. If we tried again, she would do an agonist protocol with Superfact. But keep the same dose of Gonal-f and luveris since the follicles grew at a nice pace and we got a nice number of eggs that were mature. She also said they would use a Pole Scope when doing ICSI to make sure the sperm was placed in the middle of the egg. (Never heard of this before and I&#39;m wondering why it wasn&#39;t used the first time? Any input on this?)</p>

<p>I asked if there&#39;s anything I could do to improve my egg quality and she said I could lose some weight. For reference, I&#39;m 200lbs at 5&#39;6. I will try to lose 25-30lbs before our next round and have read It Starts With the Egg and am trying to live by it as best I can. </p>

<p>I also asked if Mr Proof should see a urologist or do a sperm defragmentation test. She didn&#39;t think it was necessary but said we could ask our home RE about it. We have an appointment with the home RE in two weeks so I think I will based on studies I&#39;ve read on this board. It won&#39;t hurt anyway. Given the improved sperm count, we will probably keep off the alcohol and do another couple IUIs. If no success, we&#39;ll go back for IVF#2 in the fall.</p>

<p>If anyone read through all that, thank you!!! Just wanted to run this by anyone who&#39;s interested and see if it the doctor&#39;s conclusions and advice sound about right? What are your thoughts on her plan for the next round? And does anyone have any thoughts on using Superfact vs Lupron? Thanks.</p>

I am new here, and I may be in the wrong place but here goes:


I am currently in treatment to do an embryo transfer in two weeks, and I use estraidol vaginally. I noticed today that I have a small, painless bump on my inner labia near my vaginal opening. What would cause this? I recently had sex with my husband a day ago, so could it be a combination of the estraidol pills and intercourse that caused me to get this? It doesn't have any fluid in it, its just a solid bump. Everything I read online says Bartholins cyst or abscess, but it doesn't have anything inside of it. It doesnt look like a wart either, it is skin colored. It does go down with heat, so I don't know it that helps to distinguish it.


I don't have any STDs besides HSV-1 but that is obvious when I get it. It normally comes up as multiple blisters on my lips, so I don't think this is what caused the bump.

- Please edit your original post with any updates instead of posting again. If you have multiple updates over several days, you may wish to say “Edit Feb 3: xyz happened. Feb 5: abc happened.”  
- Edit your original post to thank people for their well wishes instead of responding Thank You! to every well wisher.  Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response.

Welcome to the Infertility Results thread and discussion! You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. 

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

<li>Please edit your original post with any updates instead of posting again. If you have multiple updates over several days, you may wish to say “Edit Feb 3: xyz happened. Feb 5: abc happened.”<br/></li>

<p>Welcome to the Infertility Results thread and discussion! You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. <strong>For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.</strong> Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. </p>

<p>Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren&#39;t ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren&#39;t rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.</p>

<p><strong>If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&amp;C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.</strong> Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.</p>

<p>For a comprehensive Beta database, check out <a href=""http://www.betabase.info/"">http://www.betabase.info/</a> for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).</p>

I'm 25. I have adenomyosis and stage I endometriosis. One of my fallopian tubes had hydro, but the tube was surgically removed. My husband and I never tried naturally because we're PGD with really bad luck. Universal blood panel showed nothing. No history of autoimmune diseases in my family. I ovulate normally. Fairly low AMH for my age (1.6). My surgeon (not my RE) says this is common for people with ENDO and isn't particularly concerned.

When I had my lap, the surgeon noted that there were no polyps or fibroids and that the stage I endo was ""borderline"". She said she expects that if I had come in at 35 it'd be more of a problem but it's still really early at this point. She also noted that there was only a ""little"" to excise, which she did, but otherwise it looked good. 

We've been through three FETs and have three left embryos on ice. All of our embryos have been hatching blastocysts. Our place uses a weird grading system. If I were to translate, the last three embryos were 5AA or 5AB. 

A caveat is that FET #1 happened before I had the hydro removed, so maybe that's why that one failed. This was a medicated cycle with vaginal estrace, PIO five days before transfer, and antibiotics 5 days before transfer. Lining was 9.3mm.

FET #2 was the same protocol. Lining was 10.7mm. 

FET #3 was a ""natural"" cycle. We waited for my period. Then, I went in for monitoring. When my estradiol was 326, LH was 4.69, and largest follicle was 18 mm, I triggered with Ovidrel. Lining was 9.7mm. I started PIO that day. FET was 5 days later. I continued PIO until beta. This time I also added in zyrtec and baby aspirin. 

I'm also pretty thin. 5'8/5'9 and 135 lbs. I eat a lot, but it just goes nowhere.

101,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all, I have been poking around for a few days and thought I should introduce myself. I just turned 32 and my husband is also 32. We have been trying to conceive for over two years and have experienced a variety of emotions throughout the journey. My flair includes a question mark around PCOS as it has not been confirmed. I did have an OB prior to trying to conceive to determine if I had PCOS or endometriosis, but I just know that my ovaries are larger so could be poly but I typically ovulate when tracking, I just have not tracked for a long period of time.
 
After going off BC, we were pregnant three months later without cycle tracking so we thought things were great, but we ended up miscarrying at 8 weeks in June 2017. We continued trying, without cycle tracking, for another 6 months with no luck. My OB then suggested leterozole to ensure I was ovulating. I was on the medication for three months and did not ovulate for two of three. I then went off the medication, started ovulation tracking, and ovulated regularly. We were then pregnant a couple months later - the same cycle month as our previous pregnancy just a year later. 

I tried to think more positively about this second pregnancy, but wanted to hold off thinking about it too much until my 8 week ultrasound. At the ultrasound they could not find evidence of a fetus, but my bloodwork showed normal levels of HCG for an 8 week pregnancy. After these results, I was having minor pain in my side and was paranoid about an ectopic pregnancy so went into the emergency room. They took an ultrasound and determined it was a molar pregnancy- seriously scary if you have experienced one. I had a D&C the next morning (May 31, 2018 - almost a year to the day from the last miscarriage) and prepared myself mentally to not try for a year. When the results came back after the surgery, it was determined that it was not a molar pregnancy, just not viable. 

Unfortunately, I am one of the few people that has scarring as a result of the D&C so I did not have a period for months. When the scarring was found, I had to wait until September for surgery to remove the scarring. After the surgery, I went to my current fertility clinic to discuss treatment options. Once my cycle retuned a month and a half later, we started a round of IUI (December 2018). The procedure was not successful and for us the success rates were the same as timed intercourse so we opted to save money for a few months and try naturally until we could afford IVF with genetic testing. 

We are now scheduled to start IVF early April. Our cycle would include genetic testing and FET. We are still going to try naturally this month, if I ovulate, since we were not put on BC. I usually have longer cycles and ovulate around day 16-19. 

All my husband’s test are normal. For me the cycle numbers on day three were: 
- AMH: 93.9 pmol/L 
- Estradiol: 139 pmol/L
- FSH: 4.1 U/L

I also had an ultrasound on day 11 that indicated I have no cysts, uterus length is 6.50 mm and height is 3.10 mm - not sure if that is relevant! Since I have a high AMH, I am at risk of ovarian overstimulation and have been told I would likely not be able to complete a fresh transfer if we changed our minds on the genetic testing. We would still have to wait until the next cycle.

107,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello all. I’m a long time subscriber and participant in this sub, but I have a question to ask on behalf of my sister.

My sister was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes when she was 7. She has very successfully managed her disease all her life since then. She is now in her late 20s, looking at getting married to her long time boyfriend, and potentially trying to start a family. But she is justifiably worried about fertility and her health as she embarks on that journey.

My own long struggles with infertility are for totally different reasons.

<p>My sister was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes when she was 7. She has very successfully managed her disease all her life since then. She is now in her late 20s, looking at getting married to her long time boyfriend, and potentially trying to start a family. But she is justifiably worried about fertility and her health as she embarks on that journey.</p>

<p>My own long struggles with infertility are for totally different reasons.

About me: 34F (almost 35), 3 miscarriages in a row.

My doctor called Wednesday to let me know the results of my bloodwork. Everything started well in this pregnancy but as of Tuesday my HCGs had halved instead of doubled and I’m spotting now. I’m disappointed because this is my third miscarriage in a row. My first was last May at 9 weeks (passed naturally at 12 weeks), the 2nd was in October at 8 weeks (D&C). Then 5 months trying to conceive again and this happened. My mom died from cancer last January and that was a really emotionally draining experience and I blamed my loss in May on that. Maybe they’re all related to that but I have a hard time believing stress caused miscarriage. No studies support that and I’ve been seeing a helpful therapist since July.

My OB has referred me to a fertility specialist and is having my blood drawn for an AMH workup tomorrow. I’m hoping that they have some new tests, anatomy checks, or can make heads or tails of the tests I’ve taken.

What do I even ask this fertility doctor? My OB suggested that IUI might help but I don't see how since we've done this naturally 3 times.

What I do know:

I have had a full blood panel looking at clotting disorders. The only thing discovered was that I am ANA+. I went to a rheumatologist and in the complete absence of any autoimmune symptoms, he felt I did not, at present, have disease. 

I have an inherited clotting disorder that is not tied to miscarriage and the hematologist that I visited was not concerned about it.

I’m pretty devastated but feeling optimistic too. I’ve started reaching out for and paying attention to the success stories and the positive outcomes women have had. After 4 rounds of IVF, one of my good friends is in her 2nd tri with a son. I don’t believe a successful pregnancy after multiple losses is impossible.

111,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility," Hi all,

This is my first post, though I've been lurking for the past few months.  Now that I've hit my year mark and am going back to my RE soon, likely to start IVF right away, I wanted to finally introduce myself.  

My husband and I have been trying for about a year now with no luck.  It's been pretty shitty, and I've had my fair share of dark days.  Literally (seriously, literally) all of my friends are pregnant or had kids in the past year, and I live in a family-oriented suburb so escaping babies even for a day is near impossible.  I've never felt like more of an outsider.

I went to see a fertility specialist a few months ago, and the issue is me.  He didn't outright say I have DOR, but from what I gather it seems I do or am close to it.  I'm 33, my AFC was 9, AMH 0.9, but FSH was normal at 6.95 and estradiol at 49.  I may also have endometriosis, because I've had a tiny cyst (\~1.5 cm) the past couple of years.  It's been shrinking and I've been asymptomatic ever since it started to shrink, so I'm having trouble believing it's endometriosis although I think I'm just in denial given everything else going on.  Luckily, my husband has great sperm, so at least it's only one of us with issues.  

My health insurance covers treatment, but not until the year mark so we kept trying on our own with the assistance of letrozole (small dose of 2.5 mg) for the past couple months without any monitoring.  I've also been taking CoQ10 (ubiquinol) consistently for over 2 months, which will hopefully better prep my eggs for next steps

I go to the RE in three weeks, which will be my actual year mark.  The last time I saw him he said that while I could try IUI, he actually thinks I should go straight to IVF if I don't get pregnant with the letrozole.  I was a little surprised he said that given that the dosage he gave me was minimal.

I've been going back and forth, trying to do as much research as possible.  At first I thought there's no point in even trying IUI since the success rates are fairly low in general, and who knows what they would be for my case, but I wonder if it's a less invasive way for him to glean helpful information for next steps while still giving me somewhat of a chance to conceive.  But on the other hand, the more I think about it the more I think I'm really just scared to jump into IVF and have it not work, and in doing IUI I would just be trying to delay the inevitable.

So first, any thoughts on IUI instead of jumping straight to IVF?  And second, I've read so many conflicting statements about whether my levels would even make me a good candidate for IVF.  Has anyone else with DOR and similar levels been told this?  And sorry, I'm sure this has been asked and answered before, but I wanted to introduce myself and get some perspective.

I know some might think this cycle was fine, but given my AFC of 18 I was really really hoping for better.  

Obv this group isn’t full of Drs but seems like there are lots of experts here.  Hop on the train and gimme your opinion!

My background:
34yo F and M
M varicocele but just had surgery
AMH as of June 2018: 3.1
AFC in June 2018 and Feb 2019: 18

IVF#1 protocol in Feb 2019:  Microflare lupron
Started 225 GonalF & 75 menopur, 2 days after microlupron started.

1st monitoring after 4 days of stims:
E2 at 750
15 measured follicles: 13, 11, and 13 more from 5-10mm.
Gonal F reduced to 200

2nd monitoring after 6 days of stims:
E2 at 1745
16 measured follicles:  3 at 15, 11 at 8-14, and oddly 2 at 6mm
Gonal F reduced to 125.

3rd monitoring after 9 days of stims:
E2 at 5205
16 measured follicles: 25, 23, 3 at 22, 3 at 20, 8 more from 12-19mm

Triggered that night with 2 Ovidrel.

Results:
19 follicles seen at retrieval
15 retrieved
10 mature (some noted as grainy)
7 Fertilized with PICSI
3 blasts on Day 5.
1 Early Blast on Day 6.
Only 1 of the 4 PGS normal, others badly abnormal.

Today at WTF, doctor says he’d recommend switching to long lupron protocol and increasing dosage to 375 Gonal f and 75 Menopur.  This shocked me because I already felt like 225/75 was way too much and my follicles grew way too fast, after only 9 days of stims.  He said long lupron surpresses more, so need more stims, plus my immature eggs need more stims.  I felt the stims already may have fried my eggs, which might have been why 4 follicles didn’t result in eggs, or why so many were immature.

As an aside, he also claimed that my AMH of 3.1 was remarkable for only having AFC of 18.  He’d expect that to correlate with something like 30 follicles.  I checked the hunger games spreadsheet and call total bullshit on this statement.

Has anybody done an IUI during a mock transfer cycle where you’re doing a uterine biopsy after ovulation?

I have one embryo remaining, and our infertility is unexplained save for some uterine issues, mainly a thin lining. So far the protocol that has gotten the lining closest to 7mm was a stimmed FET using Menopur, so we’re going to do a mock cycle of that for an ERA before attempting a transfer. 

However, we’re out of pocket for IVF and the Menopur alone will run us over $1500. I hate to “waste” it on a mock cycle where my lining is actually close to thick enough and we’ve paid all that money for meds, so our RE suggested we at least do an IUI (which is the one thing we have insurance coverage for). However, the biopsy for the ERA will be 7DPO.

RE said that it can certainly disrupt implantation, cause it to fail, or cause a chemical pregnancy. But she was adamant that any detrimental effects would be early on and wouldn’t result in something like a later miscarriage or birth defects. I know the chances of it working are super low but I just want to try something. (Edit: am in no way implying that CPs are no big deal or are not utterly devastating).

145,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Good Morning everyone. So 31M here. 5""7. 270lbs give or take depending on the day. I go to the gym 7 days a week and spend about an hour there. Ive lost weight, went from 325 to 260, then started doing weights until I gained at 270. But this isnt about weight loss, but I figured it would be helpful in some way.

About a year ago, we had sex and my wife had a miscarriage. She was on birth control. We weren't exactly trying for a kid then. It wasn't until we started trying the shit hit the fan. We started our journey at RMA of CT. I wont name the doctors for obvious reasons. But my wife has very mild PCOS and the doctor said there was no reason for her not being able to get pregnant. Ok so my turn.

I suffer from white coat syndrome, so I get nervous and my blood pressure shoots up. 1st sperm test. It was an odd experience. Just a room with a chair and a TV. Wait for the results to come back. Nothing. Doctor said they found no sperm. So, we schedule a urologist appointment. Had to be a specialty doctor. He does a 2nd test along with a hormone test.

In the mean time, the first test is starting to shake me to my core. I try to make up excuses. ""I was nervous"" or ""Oh, maybe its my hormones""...Something, anything to rationalize it. Test results come back. Hormones are fine. What the fuck? 2nd Sperm test comes back. They find a little bit (10,000). At this point I go into a full fledged depression/anxiety mood. I have my good days, my bad. I just felt worthless. Not worthy of being a man. Not worth anything to society. Not worthy of being on this hell hole of a planet just to use up resources. I don't do my hobbies, I just come home, eat and up zoning out into space. My gym routine takes a hit. I just do cardio and not weights while taking on a nihilistic attitude of ""Why? Its not like its  doing any good..."". I just dont feel well about myself. My self worth and self esteem take a big hit. I dont have many friends and the one person I asked if we can meet up to talk, kind of blew me off by not responding. That HURT. I felt isolated and alone. I feel anger and hurt that no one will understand what I am going through **Because** I am a Male. Where are my hash tags? Where are my support groups? No support out there for me. I have not gone public with this or told Mom and Dad.

I still feel this way. I freak out from time to time and think ""My wife should just leave me"". I tell her too, but she doesn't want to. She wants to be pregnant and I cant give her that. I flat out refuse to use a sperm donor. I mean, why should she get something out of this whole ordeal? It wont even be MY child. It will be hers and someone elses.

But I digress. I healed over time. I rebuilt myself up and went back to ""I know who I am, I know what I like, so I am going to do that stuff that I like to do"", and I felt good for a while. I ***was*** healing. We had a 3rd test scheduled. I kept my attitude up about it. We had a plan. I was going to relax as much as I can and then give a sample. I was confident this was going to be the one. This one was slightly different as it was a cryosample. Frozen and then thawed.

It wasn't. I got news yesterday. On my lunch, I didnt even eat. I just went to the car and cried. I did not want to be  around people. I didnt sleep well last night either. In all honesty, I can feel a certain darkness enveloping me. Ive tried keeping it at bay but it feels like I am running out of options. I know Micro-Tese is still an option, as is adoption, but its so expensive. Again, sperm donor is out of the question. I refuse to do it. It doesnt feel right and Im not 100% if I want a child at that point.

At this point, if I have faulty genetics, is it worth doing Micro-Tese? All my tests came back fine and I dont have any markers. The doctor \*Did NOT\* test for obstructions, and I have a slight problem with this.

So, this is my story and I dont know where to go or who to talk to about how I feel. I am angry, hurt, depressed and just all around fucked. Its a god awful small affair. I know I can talk to my wife, but at the same time, I cant. She cant be my punching bag all the time. My works taking a hit as well. I apologize if any of this came off as misogynistic.

151,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello, 

As an intro: We’re 33f and 35m, and have been TTC for just over 4 years. Husband had bilateral undescended testes which very unfortunately were only corrected when he was 5. This has had a big impact on his fertility, which coupled with my knack for growing large ovarian cysts has made our journey a real fun ride. 

We’ve most recently had a cancelled frozen embryo transfer a few months ago in our home country (where we are lucky enough to have 4 beautiful ICSI embryos stored) - due to minimal uterine lining thickening, but because of work commitments and costs to fly back, we have decided to give the whole process another try but in our host country instead. So we’ve booked an initial consultation here for the end of the month, to get the ball rolling this side. 

While I can say it’s been a tough one for us, I feel it’s an underestimate as my husband would attest to. He’s the best person I’ve ever met, eternally patient and kind but I can see the whole thing is eating away at him too. So my question is, how did you deal as a couple with the IVF roller coaster? I get that as the ‘primary’ patient in this that it could feel as though it’s just me alone, but I can see how hard this is for him, and how much he is silently carrying. 

I guess I’m looking for advice on how to make this whole shitshow easier for my amazing partner. He doesn’t open up much, while I’m a big communicator, but I can see it’s tearing him up. Any advice would go a long way in helping our marriage. (Couple counseling would be great but as we’re recent immigrants, we simply can’t afford it).

We’re living in Australia. 

TL;DR how can I make the IVF process easier for my husband, who is silently suffering?

Previous posts can be found in my history. 

The more I read my BIL’s (brother of spouse and spouse’s sister who had baby) comments the more outraged I become. I feel physically ill that someone is so terribly disrespecting me and my spouse. 

I would never let a stranger treat me this way, why should I allow an in law? I feel strongly that it’s in my best interest to cut my BIL off for two reasons; one, for my well being and self worth, because I have the absolute right to participate as I see fit. Two, to make an example of him to the rest of my in law family. A public message that I do not negotiate with terrorists. 

I’m torn between doing what’s right and what’s diplomatic. My spouse is so fragile right now, I’ve never seen him like this. I’m so worried for him. But there’s a part of me that’s so sad he doesn’t seem to understand where I’m coming from. When I tried last night to gently explain my feelings about BIL, my spouse started to get very upset and said, “You’re not going to talk to my brother anymore? I can’t deal with that right now, I’m already depressed with how my family has handled this, I can’t handle anymore, I’m going to get pushed further down!” Then he ran upstairs crying and went to bed. A few minutes later he texted me saying “I need you. Please come upstairs so I can hold you.” I did and we just held each other. I waited until he fell asleep so I could cry. 

What I learned last night is this has severely traumatized my spouse. I’m scared. Maybe we shouldn’t have sent the PR statement. I don’t think we were wrong to send it, I think we were wrong to expect understanding from these people. Nobody has come forward to support my spouse in light of BIL’s comments, which has been very troubling. But it really shows how ill equipped they are at handling this subject and how they’d just prefer it didn’t exist. Clearly even at the expense of spouse’s well being. 

The second thing I learned is I can not talk to my spouse about what I need or how I want to handle this situation. At least not yet. It was very scary to see his reaction last night, he seemed totally unprepared for the possibility I might cut his brother off. This dismays me, because it’s starting to feel again like he’s protecting his family’s feelings first over me, but I’m also mindful that this is a really fucked up time and he’s emotionally confused. 

The third thing I learned is the scariest. I’m worried that this has caused serious harm to spouse. During my SIL’s pregnancy, my spouse’s reactions and behaviors may have mostly been in support of me, and not necessarily him. The reason I feel that way is he told me, shortly before the kid was born, he feels like he needs a relationship with the child to cope with not being a father. It caused some argument because I felt using a baby as a surrogate was potentially unhealthy and would undoubtedly bring more issues home. I felt abandoned because he seemed to forget everything we went through and how it changed me. Plus, I _don’t_ want a relationship with the child right now, and I don’t give a fuck what any of them think about it. It’s my right. We both agreed the PR statement would be a team approach, and that at the very least, people would respect it. But there’s also something more sinister at play; BIL went beyond the pale and attacked me and spouse in a very personal way. It’s a loud and clear statement that we are unacceptable in current form and need to “get a handle on this.” And I think that has shaken my spouse terribly. We invited a response but never expected the response we got. And we don’t know how to handle it, because this is really big. My BIL ended his text with a threat, “You guys better get a handle on this like now because this are going to get weird really fast.” Translation: Control your wife, get over yourself or you’re going to ruin the family.

So I don’t know what to do. I feel it’s the right thing to cut off BIL but not necessarily the diplomatic thing. My husband has long said the behavioral motto in his family is to “go along to get along.” I am not interested in subscribing to that motto. And I’m not interested in keeping a relationship with an asshole who mansplained me on how I should feel and act about my infertility. But how much of my actions would be reckless to my dear spouse? I also realize my husband is nowhere near ready to entertain the idea. To be clear, I’m not asking him to cut his brother off, but I do not deny it will surely fuck things up if _I_ do. 

Advice? Thanks. 

Bottom Edit: To those asking, we are desperately searching for an infertility therapist. I’ve contacted two I found through Resolve; (only TWO were listed in my entire super blue Democratic state!) one contacted me, and her availability is limited - it would require us going into work late to see her, which might be difficult but possibly doable.

163,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Welp. My egg retrieval produced 12 eggs, 10 mature, 8 fertilized. Received a call (at 9am at work on a fucking Monday) from my RE on day 7 to be told that only one made it to day 7 but it was such poor quality they were unable to biopsy and it would not make it to freeze. She added me to her schedule for next Monday morning as she is away at a conference this week and she is hopeful to learn about some new treatment options while she is away. 

I have some questions about my treatment, like if she was over aggressive with the meds which created poor quality eggs? It was a antagonist protocol with estrogen priming. Estrogen patch at day 21 of the previous cycle, changed every other day, then day 2 of my period Menopur 300iu and Gonal F 300iu, my trigger was given when my biggest 2 follicles were 21, 22, and the others were between 17-12mm, trigger was subcutaneous 5000 HCG and I don't know how much Lupron (80 units in the insulin syringe). During my protocol I was taking 10mg Melatonin as I read of benefits and did not see any harm in taking it and I was an anxious mess and couldn't sleep and that is what my husband takes. 

&#x200B;

My history, every fucking thing that could go wrong each time I have been pregnant feels like it has. Started trying 2 years ago, husband was taking DHEA for body building, but guess what, this makes men sterile while they take it. I realized this, after he stopped taking it, 3 months later his sperm was back and I was pregnant with a CP, then the very next month, twins with trisomy 13 found at my NIPT, then two months after the TFMR, pregnant again with a mmc, d and e didn't get everything, scary ride to the hospital with blood spilling out of me caused us to wait on birth control for 3 months, off of it and that month pregnant with ectopic. 

&#x200B;

I was told it was bad luck. My day 3 labs are as follows: 

FSH: 10.82

Estradiol: 36

AMH: 1.597

AFC: 23

LH: 5.07

Prolactin: 5.73

TSH: 1.64

BMI is 32, I am chubby, and working on it but the off and on pregnancies and losses and all the other excuses I can give you feel valid to me. 

My remaining tube is open, no known issue with my uterus. No history of being diagnosed with PCOS or fibroids, no endometriosis, normal 25-32 day cycles. He is 39 with one LC from 12 years ago. His SA was done when we used coconut oil, she said it was not concerning but motility was low (41%, likely due to our inability to follow basic instructions), and I do not know how to interpret morphology but head defects 79% and 9% normal forms? 

The RE said my labs do not indicate why there has been an issue with each pregnancy, she thinks it is ""bad luck"". I know my FSH is in the suboptimal high range, AMH is a little low but not indicative of no eggs, AFC is high enough and I can get pregnant. I personally think there is something wrong with the eggs but what do I know. 

It was recommended that we do IVF with PGS to be sure that anything implanted is normal, but if we can't even get to the part where they can be tested, and it is so much on my body, I am not seeing the benefit. I want to try naturally one more time, but with only 1 tube I am worried I will ovulate on the wrong side and what if it's another mc? Would it be reasonable to try one month and  go right into an IVF cycle the next if I fail to get pregnant? Do you think that one failed retrieval could be from being given crazy high doses of meds? What labs or factors determines poor egg quality? Anyone have ideas on protocols I can discuss with my RE or questions I should ask? I feel the estrogen priming may have decreased my AFC, because it was 12 when my baseline was almost double that number. 

&#x200B;

And what the fuck. I am really feeling angry at the universe for not giving me one fucking break. I know you are all here with me and likely feel very similar but I am quite angry at the world today and honestly hope work goes well because I may break down at any time.

I'm 33, married ten years now, and my husband and I have been trying for four years now. We've basically have had radio silence. Not a single test result has pointed to anything and there have been zero pregnancies. We've missed trying exactly two cycles (each time one of us was super sick) and that's about it.

I thought that time would help me adjust to this, but it hasn't at all. My Sister in Law recently announced that she was expecting yesterday (First grandkid, too) and it's just opened the sutures of my heart back up. I'm simultaneously thrilled for them, sad for myself, and hating myself for feeling sad in the midst of their happiness. I also feel super isolated because I can't talk about feeling so sad. I don't want to rain on anyone's parade. My husband does a better job at taking things in stride so he's thrilled he's going to be an uncle but all I see right now is what is out of reach. You can do everything right and still not get what you want.

That being said, literally just an hour before we heard the news we were talking about stepping the game up. We each see a doctor but because there hasn't been anything conclusively found there hasn't been much of a game plan. I would really like to see if we'd be candidates for anything else but our docs haven't brought it up. Now that we've crossed the four year mark I feel like we're staunchly in the ""this obviously isn't working"" camp. We have no official Infertility diagnosis because our insurance won't pay for anything related to Infertility once that's on our records but I think I'm ready to move into it and just eat the out of pocket costs.

I really do like my doctor - she's great, warm, personable! But I feel like she's more on the ""wait it out and see"" side of things than the ""lets get this sorted out."" I was thinking about calling her office and asking for an appointment and saying all this (minus the sister in law emotions part) and asking her to be more proactive about this. I think if she's non responsive then I might just ask for my medical records and walk and do some ""interviewing.""

Has anyone had this kind of conversation with their doc? How did it go? Any advice on this?

&#x200B;

ETA: So, I took everyone's advice and scheduled an appt. with an RE. We'll go in late May, as that was the first available new patient appointment. Thank you for the pep talk on finding someone else to see. I filled the paperwork out to have my records transferred and I'll walk my husband through that process with his doctor once I'm home with him.

Again, if the argument you have is against stem cells because of your ethical belief system, please do not add it to the discussion. It is my blastocyst so it is my decision between the two. 


I have gone through IVF and, due to underlying medical issues, I have a serious heart problem that has emerged. (Tricuspid valve regurgitation) I had 4 blastocysts that made it to day 5. We transferred 2 fresh. So I have 2 frozen ones left. 

I am not able to transfer them and get pregnant because of the heart issue that popped up (not to mention other underlying medical conditions that made it extremely difficult.) 

Instead of paying $500/year for storage knowing that I can never use them without a surrogate, my husband and I are focused on what to do with the blastocysts now. 

We have settled on either: 
1. Donating them to science for stem cell research. 
2. Donating them anonymously to someone who can use them. 


Here is our dilemma: 
1. Several countries are way ahead of us when it comes to stem cell research due to their laws on blastocysts being used for testing being much more lax than the US laws. 
2. I have multiple medical conditions that are genetic and, unfortunately, rare so that there is little research and absolutely no cure or treatment (except for treatment of symptoms.) The last thing I want to do is donate a blastocyst with the medical problems and burden both the parents and child with that. In addition, I don’t want the blastocyst to be frozen for years if the medical history keeps someone from selecting the blastocyst when it could be helpful to science in the meantime. 


I’m hoping I can get some perspectives from people on the donation. I realize many people would be on the receiving end so I would love an opinion about whether or not you would use said blastocyst knowing there is a chance of a medical problem in the future.

I've been seen as a cis woman by everyone I've met for a while now, and it's really opened up some very uniquely alienating situations that I don't know how to deal with.

{edit with specifics, thx for being so inclusive}

Honestly, I just don't know how to navigate these situations at all lately. It feels like I'm trapped whenever a conversation turns to the topics of pretty much anything fertility related. People treat me like any other woman my age, which is amazingly validating, and it makes it even more awkward to talk about anything negative. I want literally nothing less than for random people I'm not very close to to find out I'm trans and start treating me differently. Essentially, my body is now very nearly identical to a cis woman without a uterus or ovaries. Any cis woman in that situation would have to take the same hormone supplements I do.

However, I don't want to have to lie to someone when they ask me something in casual conversation like ""when do you think you want to get pregnant?"". I don't want to invalidate how incredibly traumatic it is for a cis woman to deal with infertility. At the very least, I wasn't told my entire life what a great mom I'd make some day from the time I was a toddler playing with dolls. I've always known I could never be pregnant, but I don't know how to deal with my situation, mentally...

It's honestly been extremely awkward more than a few times lately. Chatting with someone at work, someone in the group of friends I'm out with at the bar, etc etc. I just don't know how to reply when someone asks me a casual question or makes a statement to me about periods, pregnancy, or anything related. I really don't want to start doing this, but I'm thinking of just saying ""I can't get pregnant"" when someone brings it up... It's a bummer, but it's fucking reality and people really need to learn that it's not really appropriate to ask things like that, because you never know someone's situation...

I don't know, I suppose I'm just wondering if anyone can relate in some way and suggest some ways to cope with being 24 and knowing there's no way I'll ever even have a non-medication induced hormonal cycle, let alone a menstrual cycle, let alone get pregnant... I feel so incredibly alone in this, and I know that statistically, I am... I'm just looking for advice for coping with this as more and more women around me start getting pregnant and having kids... I suppose I've never had to confront all of this head on until relatively recently, when I started being seen as a regular cis woman by everyone new that I'd meet. All of this just feels soul crushingly unfair sometimes, honestly...

Thanks for reading.

<p>Honestly, I just don&#39;t know how to navigate these situations at all lately. It feels like I&#39;m trapped whenever a conversation turns to the topics of pretty much anything fertility related. People treat me like any other woman my age, which is amazingly validating, and it makes it even more awkward to talk about anything negative. I want literally nothing less than for random people I&#39;m not very close to to find out I&#39;m trans and start treating me differently. Essentially, my body is now very nearly identical to a cis woman without a uterus or ovaries. Any cis woman in that situation would have to take the same hormone supplements I do.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t want to have to lie to someone when they ask me something in casual conversation like &quot;when do you think you want to get pregnant?&quot;. I don&#39;t want to invalidate how incredibly traumatic it is for a cis woman to deal with infertility. At the very least, I wasn&#39;t told my entire life what a great mom I&#39;d make some day from the time I was a toddler playing with dolls. I&#39;ve always known I could never be pregnant, but I don&#39;t know how to deal with my situation, mentally...</p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly been extremely awkward more than a few times lately. Chatting with someone at work, someone in the group of friends I&#39;m out with at the bar, etc etc. I just don&#39;t know how to reply when someone asks me a casual question or makes a statement to me about periods, pregnancy, or anything related. I really don&#39;t want to start doing this, but I&#39;m thinking of just saying &quot;I can&#39;t get pregnant&quot; when someone brings it up... It&#39;s a bummer, but it&#39;s fucking reality and people really need to learn that it&#39;s not really appropriate to ask things like that, because you never know someone&#39;s situation...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I suppose I&#39;m just wondering if anyone can relate in some way and suggest some ways to cope with being 24 and knowing there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll ever even have a non-medication induced hormonal cycle, let alone a menstrual cycle, let alone get pregnant... I feel so incredibly alone in this, and I know that statistically, I am... I&#39;m just looking for advice for coping with this as more and more women around me start getting pregnant and having kids... I suppose I&#39;ve never had to confront all of this head on until relatively recently, when I started being seen as a regular cis woman by everyone new that I&#39;d meet. All of this just feels soul crushingly unfair sometimes, honestly...</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

“Hi all,

Just wanted to let you know we are happy for SIL and her spouse’s new arrival. Chispeante leaving the group chat may have been unexpected, but this is a painful subject for both of us. We can’t have children, nor can we share grandchildren with either of our families. Infertility is a significant stressor on a marriage and something that we’ve been working through together. I fully support Chispeante’s choice to participate as is comfortable for her, and ask that you respect her wishes. 

(We then linked an article to the impact of infertility on couples and explained it was helpful to us and may be useful for them.)

We wish all the best to SIL and her spouse.”


BIL responded within minutes:

“Spouse, the baby is real, it exists, it will probably be at every family function from now on. Chispeante can’t be protected from this forever. SIL was pregnant 9 months, so this isn’t a surprise thing. I’m sorry this is upsetting to her, but the reality is that she’s an adult and this is just life. If even the concept of SIL’s baby had been so upsetting to her, what is the real thing going to be? Are you guys just not coming to family functions?”
 
A few minutes later BIL sends this:

“The fact that SIL has to put up with any of this is just ludicrous. You didnt get to be a father, and we are all sorry about that, but you get to choose to be an uncle. Because you either are an uncle to Baby or your not. Spouse, if you guys don’t get a handle on this like now, things are going to get weird real fast.”

The rest of the in-laws have been so far silent. Spouse is devastated by BIL’s response. I’m so sad for him. He’s upstairs lying down. I told him not to respond, that we sent our statement and it needs no further explanation. We did nothing wrong. My heart is breaking for him so hard, I can’t even think about my own. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I had a major operation as a baby to remove a tumour, it left me with a lot of scar tissue in my abdomen. I never had my operation or details of it explained to me as a child. I was abused by my parents and have no  contact with them now.

I’m 31 and have been with my new partner just over a year and recently got engaged. Since November I’ve been off work sick with terrible pelvic pain and they found I had a blocked Fallopian tube. I had surgery last week to unblock the tube.

Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. 

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top ""Read This"" sticky on the main page.** For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, r/InfertilityBabies. Of course, you are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences (and continue to support other community members) here on r/infertility.

As predicted, I awoke to a barrage of congratulatory texts from my spouse’s family and new baby photos from SIL. She had a C section that morning. I was groggy, it was barely daybreak, so I closed my phone and went back to sleep. 

When I woke up later, there were additional photos of my spouse’s parents holding the baby. This was too much for me to take, so I left the group text. I’m not the savviest tech person, and did not realize others would be notified that I had left. I get on with my day, and try to put things out of my head.

A couple of days later I ask spouse how things were going for SIL and what the kid’s name is. He gets quiet and then says that evidently my SIL saw I left the group text and had an extremely negative emotional response. Enough that my BIL sent a private text asking my spouse to contact SIL because”Chispeante is ruining her kid’s birthday.” 

This obviously upset me greatly for several reasons. One, my spouse immediately skipped to his BIL’s lou and texted SIL where he proceeded to issue her a PR statement on my behalf that is NOT what I would ever had said. Two, because my spouse immediately went to protect his family’s feelings over mine. At no point did BIL say, “Hey we saw Chispeante left the group text, we know this must be difficult for her. It’s also upset SIL, would you mind reaching out to her later?” And at no point did my spouse say, “She obviously left because she’s very upset. I’m happy to contact SIL but I support my wife’s choices.” Or something to that effect, anything. Three, because BIL’s comment was so offensive and ignorant and completely disproportionate to my action.

It made me realize, with great sadness, that since we found out spouse is infertile, literally nobody in his family has supported us. Not one word has ever been uttered to see if we’re okay, if we need anything. When I had a miscarriage, nobody reached out to me. Not one person. And this response by BIL is the cherry on the cake. How ignorant and insensitive must a person be to lay such an accusation on someone simply for leaving a group chat? It’s disgusting and so ridiculously self absorbed! I’m honestly lost and ready to be done with all of them. 

I had a long conversation with spouse where I expressed my disappointment and hurt over his BIL’s comment, and how he chose to handle the situation. Thankfully he was able to see my perspective and apologized for speaking on my behalf without telling me. He also apologized for not voluntarily coming forward about it sooner; it wasn’t until I asked about how his SIL was doing. He also realized his family has been completely  unsupportive and was equally shocked at his BIL’s response. 

So we’ve decided to curate a joint PR statement to his family which he will send via group text (because god forbid this family actually have a face to face conversation about anything difficult.) The gist is essentially we wish the very best to SIL but it’s a very painful subject for us both, and that he supports my choice to participate, or not, as is comfortable and asks them to respect my wishes. Then we’re sending a useful article link about the impact on infertility on couples. It’s a short unemotional text, but gets the point across that this is my decision whether involve myself in her kid’s life and won’t be questioned. 

If you’ve gotten this far, thanks for reading. I’m aware several people in this sub enjoy downvoting me; I’ve been called extreme and unfair, and I think anyone’s attempt to judge another person’s infertility journey is misguided and possibly an attempt to try and control their own infertile destiny, which I understand.

Husband (30yo) and I (28yo) have been trying to conceive since late Nov with no success. I started taking ovulation tests last cycle and still nothing. So my OBGYN ran some day 3 labs Tuesday and I got a call today from her nurse saying my FSH was high: do I want to retest in a month or be referred to a specialist?

My question here is what does the process look like going forward and what treatment options are available? I plan on being referred but I would like some information to think on over the weekend. I’m having a hard time finding anything online about FSH that isn’t related to menopause. 

UPDATE 3/11/19
Nurse called back this morning. FSH was 15.6 with a normal range of 3.8-8.7. 

The specialists they would refer to would be 1.5hours out of state or 3 hours instate. So I called the instate one to see if they were in my insurance network and they are, but my insurance excludes all infertility coverage except initial labs. So basically all this doctor could do is run a HSG? lab since my OB ran TSH/FSH/Prolaction/Estradol. I’m so mad because I work for a hospital system that just built a massive new women’s center and they’re claiming to be the number one provider in the region. 

Not sure where to go from here other than just keep trying naturally. Is there any harm to potential fetuses with a high FSH? Does it mean the eggs are of a lower quality?

However, due to my age, I think about starting a family approx. every .00045 seconds. He wants to wait a couple more years, and that's fine. But some of the fundamental stuff should start now (getting healthier, losing weight, physicals/bloodwork, etc.) But I have this nagging feeling that we will encounter fertility issues. Here's why:

* His small testicle size. I can't find any helpful resources online as a guide though. I'm just using memory as a source.
* He had an u/s done 10+ years ago because his doctor wanted to make sure his testes ""were there"". I can't recall what age he was.
* He had bloodwork done at the time and hormones, thyroid, etc. came back normal as far as he can recall
* He offhandedly, jokingly commented the other day about going through puberty late
* Thinning of the hair on top/crown of his head which hasn't worsened in the time I've known him
* He's tall (6'4"") with long arms and legs. But so is his half-sister. Their mother is average height/proportions; haven't met their dads
* He was massively overweight in his teens, but amazingly lost ~150lbs by his early 20s. 
* He is pear shaped, in that his abdomen carries alot of his bulk, and has the appearance of wide hips/waist with a narrow chest
* Slightly knock-kneed, not too noticable with pants/shorts on (not sure if this is just a result of his childhood obesity though) [saw this issue included in a KS illustration]
* He does have excess ""breast tissue"", but this could also be the result of massive weight loss. He believes it's gynecomastia but hasn't had it diagnosed.
* Not much visible muscle mass in his arms; my bicep flex would be more noticable than his. This could be from loose skin too though? Calves have definition, but that's about it. Forearms are slim and almost feel sharp. He is able to lift me up, carry heavy stuff, etc.
* I have no idea how to decipher what can be the result of goofy weight distribution genes and/or dramatic weight loss. He also works a desk IT job and isn't very physically active these days, so who knows what's under all his fluff
* Additionally: No sexual dysfunction, plenty of body and facial hair, no cognitive issues, no broken bones

I love this man to pieces, and I want to approach this in the most rational, supportive, loving way possible. He knows about my expectations regarding kids, so that part won't scare him. I just want to be ahead of the game, no matter what the news is.

How would you want someone to broach this topic with you if you were in his shoes? What worked well for you if you were in this position, in either set of shoes? I don't want to needlessly scare him, just encourage him to get some bloodwork and a physical while specifically discussing his reproductive health with his doc. I figure I can also schedule the same for myself so we can be united in our efforts - I'm overdue!

He has low normal morphology but otherwise normal SA. 

Up until recently I had all normal test results, patent fallopian tubes, normal FSH, etc. However, last week I found out my AMH is 0.03 ng/ml. There's no history of early menopause on my Mum's side, though we don't know the history on Mr Dad's side as he has no living female relatives. Amazingly enough his mother didn't discuss her reproductive history with him before she became ill with Alzheimer's. Who'd've thunk it right. 

Beginning in September 18 we did 3 cycles of letrozole, but all three cycles ended up being <21 days. That's when my obgyn finally referred me to an RE. 

The RE said that either the letrozole shortened my luteal phase, or I'm not ovulating. I suspect it's the latter as I have only had cycles <21 days or >38 since July 18.

My RE has told me that if I want to do IVF I have to do it this year, and it will cost 15k CAD. Unfortunately I've just gone back to school for nursing so we really don't have the money. Plus she won't register me until they do a ultrasound. 

For now we've decided to do some cycles with letrozole and progesterone. I'll have to check if I'm ovulating with a blood test on cd 24. If I don't they'll up the letrozole twice then after the third cycle I'll have to see my RE to follow up. 

Thankfully my research has shown that while AMH levels are correlated with time to menopause and response to fertility treatment, they're not correlated with effective time to pregnancy. That's something at least! 

I was handling this pretty well imo until I found at last night that a friend is pregnant. She's due in September, and she got married this January. I feel for her because she vacationed in zika territory before she found out about the pregnancy, which was unplanned. However, it's kind of sent me for a loop. 

I'm wondering if anyone here also has super low AMH, and how things have worked for you. 

I am so thankful this community exists, I don't know anyone else who has had these issues who's still trying. My younger sister also has infertility issues, but her and her husband decided several years ago to be childfree, so she's of limited support.

I’m 31 years old and I recently visited a cool clinic in the NYC area to see if I was a good candidate for egg freezing...

some history 
*diagnosed with premature ovarian failure at 22 
*survived 5 miscarriages, twice with twins 
*only had 3 menstrual cycles in the last 8 years
* FSH & LH through the roof 

So, I paid my fee for my fertility assessment after getting excited about my cycle returning for two months in a row (I was so pathetic in the store trying to buy pads and tampons)! I went to my assessment and verbally gave the doctor my history. She was great. So transparent, basically letting me know my chances of being able to freeze my eggs probably weren’t good, and I’d be better off seeking the help of donor eggs or adoption...RESPECT

The doctor referred me to a high risk obstetrician who will be able to do some testing to find out why my body is failing me. However, they completed my assessment which included blood work (FSH, LH, AMH) and a vaginal ultrasound. I have yet to receive my blood test results, but I was told that I have no eggs in my left ovary, POSSIBLY one single solitary egg in my right ovary & a big ass fibroid on the back of my uterus. 

I was quoted pricing for egg donation, fertilization, medication, the whole nine...which I can’t afford and I’m not interested in until I find out if I can even carry a pregnancy. My feelings about egg donation are an entire essay of emotional word vomit. 

Basically, is there anyone out there with a similar story or any advice, encouragement, anything?! It’s hard talking to people about this because they give me the whole “my cousin was told she couldn’t have kids, and now she has four.” Ok, great. However, as a believer in a higher power, science and pure common sense...I’m not hopeful. But, I’m open to hearing what others whom I don’t know have to say! 

UPDATE 3/25/19: so apparently I should have said follicles instead of eggs in/on my ovaries...

We've been trying to conceive for 17 cycles, with one early miscarriage last February. I had a surgery for endometriosis in 2015, and might revisit the idea of another one if our tests are inconclusive.

My first post here essentially described my emotional conflict with my sister in law’s pregnancy. I’d also just been invited to her baby shower and was fretting on whether I should go. 

Well, I didn’t attend. And I have zero regrets. What’s slightly creepy is my SIL was immediately informed by the hostess I declined my invitation (by polite email.) I’m not sure if this was standard practice or more of a “omg your sister in law isn’t coming!” I’ll never know and I don’t really care. I discovered this tidbit via my spouse who was told by his mother. Here’s the kicker: neither she or my sister in law had any clue why I declined. How is this possible? How can you be that tone deaf? Further, my MIL told my spouse that my SIL thought I was mad at her at the birthday dinner we had to suffer when she first announced her pregnancy. I sat on the far end of the table and said very little to ANYONE, but my sister in law decides it has to be about her? Bullshit. She knew what was up, but to frame it as being “mad” at her was so juvenile. It made me realize these people are completely self centric with little regard, and after my spouse told me this, I had no remorse for not attending whatsoever. My MIL also asked if we were “going to do IVF again” as casually as you ask to pass the salt. Zero conception of what it actually means to “do IVF again” and the physical and emotional demand it causes. My spouse told her we are no longer discussing our private life. As a personal chuckle, I never received a thank you card for the shower gift I sent in my absence. Just more evidence to look out for myself and my own well being. 

She’s having a C section tomorrow, which is a bit schadenfreude for me if I’m honest. Of course I wish no harm, but it’s a tad funny she spent her entire pregnancy in tip top shape to aid during “vaginal delivery.” As if that’s even a guarantee! Her way of thinking is perpetually adolescent. Still, it’s kind of funny that her “plan” went to complete waste. 

Things are getting sticky with my spouse. He told me he would like a relationship with this child because otherwise he doesn’t think he can cope not being a father. Great. First, we were in agreement that IVF was not what either of us wanted to do again. Second, we were a unified front that we weren’t going to allow upset in our lives with this new child. But now, both of these commitments are totally erased with his single statement. I couldn’t feel more terrible. And slightly abandoned, if I’m honest. He actually asked me “for an update on your feelings” and if I would “feel this way forever.” Let’s just say that wasn’t well received. I told him I don’t subscribe to whatever standard he’s set for how he thinks I should be feeling about things by now, and that I’m not conforming to suit anyone’s feelings but my own, including his. I also told him he doesn’t get to have it both ways; he doesn’t get to ask me to go through IVF and then quasi-complain  how it has shaped me now as a result. It’s also possible to not be certain about wanting a baby AND be sad and angry that you lost one. 

So these new developments are complicated. Tomorrow everything is going to change. That baby will be born, and I have no interest in participating in the event. Thankfully, we can’t immediately, because SIL mandated some vaccines in order to see baby that my spouse and I never got around to getting. Him because he’s lazy and me because no thanks, not interested. And I really have no idea what this means for my marriage in the long term, because I don’t see my feelings changing any time soon and my husband has now shifted favor to the new baby. I honestly don’t see how this can end well. 

Lastly, I’m fairly certain my MIL has tried to manipulate my presence on certain occasions where the baby will also be present. MIL and FIL are paying for an obligatory family trip this summer for a wedding, and she withheld that SIL and baby would be on the flight and seated in the same aisle as me on the plane. She also withheld that we are all staying in a family villa, including SIL and baby. I only discovered this when I checked the reservation information. I went ballistic to my spouse about this who promised to insist on separate quarters for us- surprise surprise, he has said nothing yet. I am NOT attending otherwise and give zero fucks how much of a loss they incur. My spouse and I couldn’t otherwise afford this trip, and as far as I’m concerned we were not fully informed when we consented. I feel totally tricked. 

Sorry for the discordant post, but my thoughts are all over the place. I’m awake with anxiety knowing I’m going to get a fucking baby photo text tomorrow and it’s going to destroy me. On the plus side I’ve started actively searching for a therapist, cut drinking to one weekend a month, and have been exercising regularly. It’s helped slightly. 

TL;DR Didn’t go to baby shower. SIL is having baby tomorrow. I’ve been shanghaied by MIL and held hostage on a trip with SIL and baby. Spouse seems to be shifting allegiance to his family and needs the new baby “to cope.” I sense impending doom for my marriage and future. 

EDIT: I’d also like to comment that the concept of up and downvoting on this sub is incredibly judgmental and potentially harmful to posters. Infertility is a complex, highly personal and totally unique experience for every individual. Valuing and differentiating someone’s feelings or opinions as “good” or “bad” on a sub where inclusivity and safety are promoted is hypocritical and frankly disappointing.

Mention of pregnancy or positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread. Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C""). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

Secondary infertility and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.

Be kind to one another. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.

This is a science-minded, realistic, and sometimes cynical sub. There are many communities online for people who want a more ""positive"" or ""upbeat"" experience complete with baby du$t.  People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic, and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies/cures as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).

Sex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. Infertility isn't cute, and neither are the terms we use. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.

No solicitations will be allowed for monetary or medication donations. To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed.

If you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button. The ""report"" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment.

Welcome to the Infertility Results thread and discussion! You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. 

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top ""Read This"" sticky on the main page.** For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, r/InfertilityBabies. Of course, you are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences (and continue to support other community members) here on r/infertility.

&#x200B;

I've been lurking here for a long time, reading everything I could and doing my research since my husband and I have been trying to conceive for about 2 years now.

I figured it was time to introduce myself since I will be starting active treatment end of March. Hope people with the same protocol or cycle schedule can chime in.

&#x200B;

Sorry if I'm doing something wrong or if the formatting is wonky, also I haven't figured out how to add flair yet.

&#x200B;

I'm 36 and my husband is 40. I've been off the BC pills for almost 2 years, doing timed intercourse and temping/tracking cervical mucus to no avail. OBGYN tested AMH (1.5) and SA (low motility and count).

Finally saw an RE in December 2018 and had some extra tests done. Came back with **low AMH, low motility and count** (but he said he wasn't that concerned about his numbers?), **ERA receptive**, **day 5 NK cells 12%**, **still waiting on DNA Frag test results.**

Due to the low AMH he's recommending an aggressive over 40 treatment because I told him I do not want to waste time with something that might not work. I also expressed my concern with my husband's low numbers but he said he's not that worried. He's willing to do ICSI with PGS just because I requested it but kind laughed at me when I mentioned the Zymot and said it wasn't really proven yet. Basically told me to trust him and his experience and stop googling things.

He's the only RE and infertility clinic in our area, the closest next one is at least 2 hours away and it would be difficult to make that work due to my work schedule.

**Here's the treatment calendar he will have me on, maybe someone that has had a similar protocol can chime in and tell me what to expect? Anyone out there that had a similar protocol? What was your experience?** I know my butt will be a pincushion with 4 vials of Menopur at once...

300,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello everyone,

I'm Raz and I'm fairly new to the infertility process (and reddit in general), but I wanted to introduce myself and hopefully find some sort of community where I could talk about this crap. I am a fairly private person and wouldn't label myself a sharer or anything like that, so to talk to people about this is very difficult. And when I do, either I get the flippant 'it'll happen when it happens' response or 'jokes' to lessen the discomfort of the conversation.   And I feel myself buying into the jokes simply to make the other person feel better about my pain. Ugh!

&#x200B;

We've been trying since I was 27, when I went off birth control pills. It was more of a 'hey let's not put pressure on ourselves and let it happen.' Well, a year went by and it didn't happen. Then two... and then three. Finally, I went to the doctor and he told me I'm not ovulating and my progesterone levels are too low. This was when he recommended a fertility specialist. And I flipped my shit, spent the last two or three years taking a break from anything related to babies or children (as much as I could.) I was angry. Everyone around me sneezed and out popped their fiftieth kid, it felt like. And here I was, financially stable, owned a house, was ready and planning how to do this. And it wasn't happening! Not only that, but the questions came about when we were going to hear the pitter patter of feet. Not once or twice, but several times from the same person or people that had no business talking to me about what was happening in my vagina. The pressure to produce offspring was unbelievable and knowing I was having trouble was making everything worse. Suffice it to say, I was depressed for a very long time, and unwilling to talk about it with anyone, not even my spouse.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now and I am in my second month of this fertility business. I did the whole round of tests the first month, enough blood tests to leave track marks on my arm, poked and prodded, round one of Letrozole. The HSG was the worst test ever. Bad enough that I screamed at the doctor that I was done and he could leave the damn room, with the speculum still inside me. Whoops. That wasn't my finest hour.  It revealed that one tube was fine and dandy and the other that caused me pain was 'probably' fine. They couldn't get a good picture because they had to force the fluid into me and by the time they did, I moved I guess from the pain and it spilled out too quickly to get an image.

&#x200B;

This month, I requested an IUI. I was done 'trying at it on my own' even with fertility pills. I am 33 and don't want to be doing this for years and years with no results. I am naturally anxious, depressed and stressed out by nature and I can't deal with the anxiety of having to time the sex and find time for sex every day to every other day around the fertile period. I feel like I am spinning my wheels. So, did the trigger shot Wednesday and the IUI was done yesterday and now I am in the waiting game. I am not positive about the results, since this has been a constant in my mind for five plus years.  I don't want to be hopeful, like people tell me to be. I want to be realistic. And the reality is the chance is so low to conceive, but better than if I were to do it on my own.

&#x200B;

Anyways, that is where I am now and this is me. Hi!

305,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,

I have been thinking about my upcoming protocol for my first IVF. My RE said she does not have a strong preference either way, but she is leaning towards recommending a long lupron agonist protocol for me. My clinic seems to use long lupron protocols more commonly than some of the others I have seen. I have a history of an ectopic, so there a question if I may have some element of silent endo? Because of this, she said she may lean towards the long agonist protocol to “calm things down” with the lupron exposure (although I can find no data to support this). Otherwise, I have unexplained infertility with AMH 3.5, AFC ~25. 

However, I am a little concerned about the longer protocol because this will involve taking lupron injections during a time period when I would have to be on call for work 24 hrs/day for 2 weeks vs a short antagonist protocol where I can do stims only over my 2 week vacation from work. 

After spending a ridiculous amount of time reading about the differences between the two, this systematic review from 2017 seems to be the most comprehensive/updated literature I have found comparing the two:

https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/5/560/3965313

It suggests that:

1)GnRH antagonist protocols have lower OHSS rates than long agonist. Lowers absolute risk of OHSS by 2.5 %. (But I’m not particularly concerned about this since I don’t have PCOS?)

2)GnRH antagonists are associated with lower ongoing pregnancy rates when compared to long protocol agonists. “Antagonist treatment prevents one case of OHSS in 40 patients but results in one less ongoing pregnancy out of every 28 women treated” 

To me, the difference in pregnancy rates seem clinically significant, but I have not seen this discussed in detail on this board before and short antagonist protocols seem much more popular. 

My question for the ladies on this board...Why did your you/your RE choose to go with antagonist protocol over long lupron agonist? 
To me, it seems like long protocol gives the highest chance of pregnancy success for patients not at high risk of OHSS, but this does not appear to be the most popular protocol for first time IVF from my reading on this board. Is this merely because of convenience ?

I think I am leaning towards the long protocol even if it involves way more injections and is not friendly to my work schedule. I think I would value higher potentially pregnancy rates above all but would really appreciate any thoughts from anyone who has made a similar choice/done either or both protocols!

It's around 12. Last cycle everything was perfect... It seems like I finally found the right dose of gonal f and the right med combination but here we are again waiting for my period to start. So after 12 cycles weve only had one that was picture perfect. We are unexplained, considered secondary because of a stillbirth in the past. I do have Hashimotos and MTHFR. We've had trouble with lining and what I believe might be egg quality issues but that's just my own theory on the egg quality not my RE's. 

Here's my question. We are OOP for everything. I dont have a great responce to fertility meds. I have only ever had one mature follice at a time. If we go stright to ivf weve agreed we can afford the testing and blood work and the medication but will need to take a loan out for the ivf procedure itself which is 8,000. We could take a bigger loan and pay a mutlicycle rate of 14,000 but we cant afford anything beyond that and arent willing to take out a bigger loan at this time. So it isnt like we have endless shots at this. I'm not very knowledgable when it comes to ivf yet so stick with me here haha. Im also assuming it's going to take a good bit before the actual ivf process starts. In the mean time my RE has me doing the same medication protocol as last cycle in the hopes that we get another perfect cycle. We can do TI again but would it be worth it to try an IUI? At this point ive avoided it for so long since we are unexplained and the success rates are so low. My husband's SA came back perfect but that was over a year ago. He had an appointment in April wirh a urologist to check on DNA fragmentation. The only way I can see an IUI helping us is that I honest to god don't get fertile cervical mucus. Before our stillbirth I did. Then after it was like my whole body chemestry changed. Mucinex doesnt seem to help. If an IUI will bypass some of the cervical mucus issues then maybe its worth a shot? I was told in the beginning of this journey years ago that I should just save my money and jump straight to IVF by people in this community and I really with I had, but hindsight is 20/20. Our ivf consultation is March 12 and I'm due to get my period any day now. I just don't want to waste money we could use for IVF on IUI if it's pointless. I'm not willing to sit out this cycle though so we'll be paying the monitoring and meds anyway, the only added cost for an IUI is the IUI itself. I guess I just wanted to get someone else's opinion that knows more than I do. 

On a side note, we live in pa which is not an ivf mandate state. Ive done my own research and have not found a single private insurance company that offers ivf coverage. Is this true or is there a way to look this info up easier? My husband's job does not offer ivf coverage but he is changing jobs in the next month and I'm really hoping this new job is going to offer it but I really doubt it.
