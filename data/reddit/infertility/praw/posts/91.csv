9,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'm not sure how to discuss this without offending everyone, so please forgive me in advance.

Maryland, Virginia, and DC have now issued ""stay-at-home"" orders. I know several other states have issued them as well. Most of the world is under some kind of restriction.

From what the media is describing, abortions are considered ""essential"" services. But from what I can see, most fertility clinics are not ""essential,"" and are shut down and/or not performing procedures.

So what gives?

Many of us are watching our biological clock with utter anxiety. Time is ticking away while we can do nothing. Personally, I'm going to have to start all over, as the lack of monitoring and medication has thrown my cycles into chaos... ovulation isn't even on the radar without help from my RE.

~~Meanwhile, all the ""Fertile Myrtle""s of the world are producing and tossing the thing we want the most.~~

Is there anything we can do about what seems like a very broken situation? Should we just suck it up and deal with it?

Abortion clinics have lawyers on the ""front lines"" fighting for their rights to stay open, in the name of ""Women's Health."" I guess they forgot that women also want to GET pregnant, not just get un-pregnant (so to speak).

I'm not trying to blame people having abortions - that's not my business. But I do feel the situation is a bit... lop-sided.

Am I wrong here? Anyone else feeling this way?

What can we do?

EDIT/UPDATE: 

First of all, I'd like to thank all of you for your comments and information. I truly appreciate the heartfelt and honest replies.

First, I'd like to apologize. I know that abortions can be a gut-wrenching, horrible experience. **It was 100% NOT my intention to bash anyone.** I do not feel that way (I don't hate or look down on people who have had, need, or want an abortion), and I can see why some people thought I did. 

The ""Fertile Myrtle"" name (in my personal world) comes from friends I've spoken with, who are commenting on their own fertility, in reference to my fertility problems. (They literally call themselves ""Fertile Myrtle"" when we have conversations about my infertility.) So I didn't realize how negative that sentence sounded. I have striked-through that statement, although I left it in the post for the sake of transparency... I want my apology to be well understood.

My heart breaks for the women who need an abortion and can't get one during this pandemic. I can't imagine what they must be going through. This whole situation is $hitty for everyone. 

I appreciate the people who recognized my frustration in this post. I am so scared that this pandemic will shut down my fertility chances forever. As I type this, I can feel my stomach knot and the tears begin. No one should be in this situation.

I still maintain the general intention of this post - that abortions \[seem\] to get much more attention and support than infertility overall, and it's extremely frustrating. This has been something that has bothered me ever since I started this infertility journey, and it's now more obvious (to me) in the wake of the pandemic. It has nothing to do with my thoughts on abortion, more like I would like to see people fighting that hard for fertility. Thank you for those of you who recognized this.

Thank you.",t2_50b5rh7j,False,,0,False,"Why are abortions ""essential,"" but fertility is not?",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_fs6dam,False,dark,0.29,,public,0,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},TW: COVID,False,0,,False,self,1585664644.0,,[],{},,True,,1585657683.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m not sure how to discuss this without offending everyone, so please forgive me in advance.</p>

<p>Maryland, Virginia, and DC have now issued &quot;stay-at-home&quot; orders. I know several other states have issued them as well. Most of the world is under some kind of restriction.</p>

<p>From what the media is describing, abortions are considered &quot;essential&quot; services. But from what I can see, most fertility clinics are not &quot;essential,&quot; and are shut down and/or not performing procedures.</p>

<p>So what gives?</p>

<p>Many of us are watching our biological clock with utter anxiety. Time is ticking away while we can do nothing. Personally, I&#39;m going to have to start all over, as the lack of monitoring and medication has thrown my cycles into chaos... ovulation isn&#39;t even on the radar without help from my RE.</p>

<p><del>Meanwhile, all the &quot;Fertile Myrtle&quot;s of the world are producing and tossing the thing we want the most.</del></p>

<p>Is there anything we can do about what seems like a very broken situation? Should we just suck it up and deal with it?</p>

<p>Abortion clinics have lawyers on the &quot;front lines&quot; fighting for their rights to stay open, in the name of &quot;Women&#39;s Health.&quot; I guess they forgot that women also want to GET pregnant, not just get un-pregnant (so to speak).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to blame people having abortions - that&#39;s not my business. But I do feel the situation is a bit... lop-sided.</p>

<p>Am I wrong here? Anyone else feeling this way?</p>

<p>What can we do?</p>

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Infertility includes: primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.

56,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi there,

My wife and I are currently going through our second IVF-ICSI cycle and we were advised yesterday by our fertility specialist of the following result:

\- 7 eggs retrieved

\- 6 Mature which underwent ICSI

\- 2 failed to fertilise while 3 of them fertilised abnormally and 1 fertilised normally. 

My wife and I are obviously very disappointed with this result and the fertility specialist said that the 3 abnormal fertilisations were due to the egg not discarding it's extra copy of it's chromosomes., i.e. not completing Meiosis. I've been doing a bit of research and the technical term of this is due to an extra pronucleus in the embryo (3PN) instead of the normal 2PN (1 from the mother and one from the father).

""Occasionally, an egg into which we only injected one sperm will show up with 3 pronuclei. When this happens we suspect that the egg did not complete meiosis and in fact retained the ½ of the female DNA that it was supposed to discard in the 2nd PB. Such an egg would have 2 maternal pronuclei, and one paternal pronucleus. Regardless of the source of the extra nucleus, any number of pronuclei above 2 is abnormal and the resulting embryo is anomalous by virtue of having too much DNA, and it cannot result in a baby"" (note PB stands for Polar body. A mature egg has 1 Polar body while a normally fertilised egg should have 2PB)

Apparently this is quite rare in ICSI (occurs about 5% in each cycle) so to have 3 of the 4 fertilised eggs to occur just seems really odd. 

Our first cycle was also a bust, in that we had 4 eggs retrieved in which 3 were immature and the 1 egg which fertilised made it to day 6 (slow growing) but ultimately wasn't viable. 

For the second cycle, my wife was on quite a high Gonal-F dosage i think 450 and was on lupron the entire stim cycle. This increased dosage was to tackle the poor response the first time around.

My wife is 32 and has lowish AMH levels but not severe.

I'm 33 and there's also MFI at play. I have very good counts and progressive motility but had <1% morphology. I also did a DNA frag test a few weeks ago but still awaiting the results. Note, this abnormal fertilisation issue doesn't seem like a sperm issue though.

From the literature I've read, it seems that the most likely cause of this is due to high gonadotropin doses during a stim cycle.

Hi y'all. Hope you're keeping sane in this crazy world we are living in! Since my FET failed, I have been trying to take a break from Reddit.. but here I am again!

Since we are on a forced break, I have had too much time to consider everything and I need some help to understand my diagnosis and how it actually affects my fertility.

When I first started to see my RE years ago, my AMH tested at 0.58. He didn't give me an actual diagnosis, just told me that the AMH would indicate that my ovarian reserve was ""probably"" lower than it should be for my age, but that I should have good quality eggs because of my age (I was 29 at the time). All of my other tests were within normal ranges and my husbands SA was excellent. 

Recently, my clinic was taken over by a bigger clinic and lots of changes have happened. I noticed that my chart now says DOR. From being on this subreddit for awhile now, I know that low AMH isn't the only indicator usually. So, I'm curious. How does low AMH prevent me from spontaneously conceiving? I assumed that there was another issue at play, but after a reasonably successful round of IVF, I feel like I know even less. 

Summary of my IVF experience:

7 retrieved, 5 mature, 4 fertilized with ICSI, 1 fertilized with IVF, 4 made it to blast, all Grade 1 (highest quality). Fresh transfer of only IVF embryo resulted in MMC at 10w4d (stopped growing at 8w1d). First FET was complete failure - no implantation.

So, I feel like now we know an egg can fertilize and become a blast, it can implant.. what's left? Is it possible still that my egg quality is poor and none of my embryos are normal? Was my lining never thick enough before doing medicated cycles? Did I not have enough progesterone to supplement after ovulation? So many questions and I can't seem to get answers.. I know a lot of you are in the same ambiguous boat, but if anyone has any insight to help, I would so appreciate it!",t2_3u00klmo,False,,0,False,DOR - help me to understand?,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_fpjlbn,False,dark,0.75,,public,4,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1585285316.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>TW: brief mention of loss</p>

My husband and I have been struggling to get pregnant. We have now ""tried"" 27 times without any success. They are aware, my husband had a vasectomy and in 2018 my mom was terminally ill. Her dying wish was to be a grandma, so we reversed his vasectomy so we could try to fulfill her dream. My whole family knew what was going on, of course, so we have not been able to hide our struggles. At this point, for me, pregnancy and babies has not brought me anything except heartache.

Just for a brief history - husband and I are both 32 and healthy with normal BMI. 

My husband did the DNA fragmentation test and it came back normal so RE thinks it's an egg quality problem. This makes sense since we've had 2 unexplained losses this year. 

RE has me taking 600mg of co-q10 daily to try to boost egg quality and in addition, wants to try substituting menopur for HCG since sometimes menopur can impact egg quality.

We are also going to do a Day 3 transfer rather than Day 5 since he said some women's embryos just don't thrive outside of the womb.

I guess I'm here looking to see if anyone has gone through a similar journey and had success? I'm so anxious about having another failed round.

Ill be as brief as possible. My wife is 31 and I'm 33. Been married 8 years. Have wanted children for at least 5 year. Have been actively trying (following ovulation etc) for two years. 

Spring of 2019, we both start seeing fertility specialists. Wife comes back nearly perfect with only benign pockets showing in her HsG test. Doctors say it's a non issue (we've had a few other doctors agree here.)

I get tested. Motility, morphology, and a few others including testosterone are really low. Varicoceles. I  had the procedure last fall and all numbers are above 'normal' now....except for morphology.  Started at a 1....it's now a 3. Needs to be at a 4 to be ideal. I'm now six months post OP, and will have another seen analysis after covid19 passes. 


Doctors say we are great candidates for an IUI technique... which we will begin after covid19 as well. 

With the ~15% success rate which equates to a ~50% success rate after 4 attempts, should we just keep trying naturally?


Our insurance policy covers advanced treatments, but has a 10k lifetime max. Maybe even skip that 2nd start with and ivf procedure?


I'm thinking of presenting the option of trying two more months naturally then going straight to IVF techniques. The morphology makes me wonder if iui is truly a great option in the context of being set against a $10k maximum.


Thanks!

These thoughts were honest, raw, and personal. I was trying to show the OP that she's not alone. That others experience these feelings. That she's not crazy or wrong for feeling this way. I ended my post with some encouraging words, because frankly, we all need that.

[Then today, I receive this direct message.](https://snipboard.io/o7iuFC.jpg) I am appalled.

Let me be very clear:

1. I am not angry *at* pregnant women. I am angry at whatever act of nature, whatever cosmic force, whatever or whoever it is that is preventing me from having a family - something that others have so easily. After five years of trying to get pregnant with no success, I'm allowed to feel this way.
2. HOW F-ING DARE YOU suggest that this is somehow a good thing... that somehow ""saving money"" is a ""bright side"" to this situation. I would give up every dollar I have if I though it would help me get pregnant. I've already spent thousands of dollars on this, and I will happily keep going in order to achieve my dreams of motherhood.

I'm so boiling mad I can barely type this post. It's one thing when someone from the ""outside"" says this - someone who's not directly experiencing infertility.

But for someone in a group that's *designed to support women through infertility* says this... there are no words.

Shame on you.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:  Thanks so much everyone for the love and support. Restores my faith in people for sure. It sucks that other people have experienced this (especially from the same original thread! WTF!!) but it's good to know we have each other's back.

Long time lurker, first time poster... TTC x 1.5 yr.  If you can’t tell by my UN I’m a pharmacist and can tell you everything about how drugs work, yet I have no idea what to expect really as a patient!  

Before we met, my wife was aware she had (what was presumed to be) a bicornuate uterus and also has Factor V Leiden putting her at huge risk for clots.  My wife and I’s journey has been very tough.  Started marriage with pretty much a “DB” if you follow that sub..... lots of emotional issues we had to deal with that were very difficult yet we knew that to conceive you had to have intercourse ;)

Turns out wife had a vaginal septum that was causing immense pain with intercourse as well as during pelvic exams that went undiagnosed by her previous OB/GYN.  That was resected July’19.  Continued TTC with no ovulation x 3 more ‘cycles’ and very irregular menses (like 30+ days of bleeding).  Was told by OB/GYN to see REI. a Pelvic MRI requested by REI, which according to the OB, revealed a need for another surgery followed by 8-10 months of contraception.  Was told it would be technically very difficult, and that REI likely was the best surgeon for the job.  Needless to say wife and I were feeling hopeless and scared as surgery ain’t a walk in the park.  The last one brought us so incredibly close, yet I feared this news would break my wife and I completely.  Went to REI expecting a surg consult and walked out with med mgmt as she actually has a didelphus uterus (not a bicorn) and the radiologist has a single typo that changed the whole prognosis (os vs ostia). 

Got further work.  MFI ruled out, Labs show possible mild PCOS (AMH 7.2), so we are starting letrozole in 2-3 weeks hopefully.

Some of you may remember me, I posted my experiences with IVM as it wasn't as common a treatment. I had success, and other than a scare with a threatened miscarriage, I graduated, I moved on to Infertility Babies.

I have a history of premature birth. Pregnancy also achieved via ART. Spontaneous rupture of membranes at 32 weeks. No indentfiable cause. No cervical shortening (primary indicator of permature birth). No infection. No issues with placenta. It may have been a fluke, or it may be that my body doesn't want to carry past that point. We were prepared for that risk. For another NICU stay.

Being high risk I would make comments about 24 weeks. People were dismissive. We had our 20 week scan done by the head of MFM from our state's hospital for Women and Newborns. The state's leading expert. Everything was perfect.

I let myself get excited. I started getting ready. 

At 23+2 I suffered a placental abruption. I went into labour. It couldn't be stopped. My baby was born. He lived for 3 days. 

After my 13 week scan I bought a beautiful maternity dress. Black, with colourful floral embroidery on the sleeves and empire waist. Today, I wore it for the first time at the funeral.

I had no risk factors for placental abruption. No identifiable cause. No connection to my previous premature birth. Another horrible fluke.

I thought I was done here. Every doctor stressed the importance of contraception for the next 18 months. The surgery was complicated, they had to use a classical incision, which means I now have a cross scar on my uterus. We haven't ever had to use contraception seriously other than during treatment. But I know that something being statistically unlikely doesn't help me.

I have two more embryos. Not today, but some point soon I have to decide if I can put myself through this again. Risk more pain if unsuccessful. Risk another neonatal death. Risk my own life, potentially. To go from the clinic to the care of the perinatal loss team. Add geriatric pregnancy in the mix. I can't even fathom that decision right now.

Secondary infertility was a completely different experience to primary infertility. I used say our worse case scenario was so far removed from what it was the first time round.

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

I’m 27 and have a below normal AMH (.5). Spoke to an RE and I’ll be going in next month to do an ultrasound and all the genetic testing, etc. and then we’ll likely do egg retrieval a month or two after that. 

So first, I’m overwhelmed with this news. I just didn’t think I’d have problems conceiving. (I should note that our plan was to conceive in about 5 years so our plan is freeze eggs or embryos.)

I’m overwhelmed by the change of lifestyle—I’m trying to take all these supplements and eat better and stop using plastic kitchenware, giving up nail polish and Diet Coke. It’s just exhausting looking at my toothpaste and shampoo and laundry detergent and wondering how shitty they are for my body. Also my poor bank account because all this stuff is not cheap. 

I’m overwhelmed with all these super weird questions I never thought I’d have to go over with my partner—like if we’re lucky to have multiple viable embryos, do we donate the extras? (I definitely think we should but he feels weird about it). If we freeze embryos now and get divorced and then I want to use an embryo, how would that work? Do we do genetic testing on the embryos? Do we freeze eggs or embryos?

I am trying to stay as grateful as I can right now. I love that science can get me further than I’d probably be able to go myself and I’m glad I have some chance of success. I’m also just scared this won’t work. 

I wish I could somehow magically know that all this works out for us... that the physical, emotional, and financial aspects of this journey are all worth it. 

Ugh and telling my family and my best friends about this has been so uncomfortable. They don’t know how to talk to me or what to say. My mom did that thing where she said “just relax and you’ll get pregnant” and I’m just tired because that’s not how any of this works. 

I’m reaching out here because it would make me feel so much better to have someone who understands and won’t talk to me like I’m broken or super depressing. I’d also love some success stories (happy to receive a dm if it’s against the rules to post).

Just got off the phone with my husband's urologist. He has a varicocele on his left testicle, confirmed via ultrasound. With two semen analysis's, here are his results:

Dates: 2/20/20, 3/12/20

Volume: 3.0/2.5

Sperm(mil/mL): 11.1/16.4

Progressive Motility: 33%/20%

Form: 11%/10%

Total motile count (mil): 10.9/8.2

The doctor recommends surgery to fix the varicocele (which won't happen until summer at least, because COVID19), and a DNA fragmentation test. Insurance doesn't cover it, so I just emailed SCSA Diagnostics to see if they're currently doing them (COVID19). His doc said he would be happy to go over the DNA frag. results if we bring them to him. I want to do it because at first, he recommended IUI, but I'm wondering if the results would sway us in another direction (IVF, or something else I'm unaware of?).

Where do we go from here? Is IVF our best bet, since we can PGS test each embryo before transfer? He said you can test the embryo, but I think he was concerned that every embryo would be defected if his sperm do have DNA frag. He said try not to stress and still keep trying, but I'm afraid of trying naturally because its just like 'rolling the dice.'

At this point, if I were offered IVF, I would do it.

Any help would be appreciated and thank you for reading if you got this far. Reddit infertility subs have helped me tremendously in knowing what to expect from his call today. I was prepared from all of my reading through this sub and knew exactly what he was referring to. And fuck MY infertility doctor, who said my husband got me pregnant so there's no reason to worry its DNA frag from his varicocele, and that it must be my uterus that can't carry a baby because I had asherman's in the past.

As an emergency doctor and infertility patient, I know we are not all on the same page about this and we don’t have to be. If you want to wait to see how this plays out, that’s great. If you feel sick about missing your chance to move forward, here is where you sign. 

I personally am 43. I just spent thousands out of pocket and flew across four states in January to fix my scarred uterus to prepare for a fresh transfer. My uterus usually rescars in 3-6 months. I am also in the middle of the best stim cycle of my entire 4 years of ivf. My afc is usually 2-4. This time it was 14. I’ve never even been close to that. Women in my position cannot afford to wait and until a ban on all women reproducing occurs, I don’t see why those with infertility are asked to bear the burden. 

This is also a huge step to legitimizing infertility as a MEDICAL condition and not an “elective” issue. If you want insurance to cover ivf in the future, I strongly encourage you to sign. 

If you would like to share why this personally affects you and where you are in your journey, I think personal stories besides your signature would be powerful. 

Thank you for reading. You are not alone. ❤️ And a huge thank you to my REI Dr. Beverly Reed for writing this so eloquently. I feel honored to stand beside women like her and even more so to have her as my doctor.

ETA for clarification- if a clinic is in SART and doesn’t follow ASRM guidelines, they will face sanctions or be kicked out. Their hands are now tied. The point of the petition is to allow them to make their own decisions.

I am also in the middle of the best stim cycle of my entire 4 years of ivf. My afc is usually 2-4. This time it was 14. I’ve never even been close to that. Women in my position cannot afford to wait and until a ban on all women reproducing occurs, I don’t see why those with infertility are asked to bear the burden. </p>

<p>This is also a huge step to legitimizing infertility as a MEDICAL condition and not an “elective” issue. If you want insurance to cover ivf in the future, I strongly encourage you to sign. </p>

<p>If you would like to share why this personally affects you and where you are in your journey, I think personal stories besides your signature would be powerful. </p>

<p>Thank you for reading. You are not alone. ❤️ And a huge thank you to my REI Dr. Beverly Reed for writing this so eloquently. I feel honored to stand beside women like her and even more so to have her as my doctor.</p>

<p>ETA for clarification- if a clinic is in SART and doesn’t follow ASRM guidelines, they will face sanctions or be kicked out. Their hands are now tied. The point of the petition is to allow them to make their own decisions. </p>

143,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi All,

I'm new here and wanted to introduce myself.  Nice to meet you!  

**A little bit about me:** I'm 39 with PCOS, Hashimotos and a family history of high cholesterol and heart issues.  I went to my OBGYN 1.5 months ago, and learned that my AMH is 0.6.  I have always wanted to be a mother, so this information mixed with my various health issues and my doctor's reaction was pretty scary.  She recommended I go to a fertility specialist and high risk pregnancy doctor.  While I haven't made it to the high risk pregnancy doctor yet, I did go to the fertility doctor and the news there was pretty bleak as well.  He told me that my right ovary has 6 follicles two of which are covered with cysts and that my left ovary is ""very small"".  He recommended I skip IUI and move directly to IVF.

**My situation:** My partner and I are both very interested in having children, but he is sterile (he was married before and went through 7 rounds of IVF all of which were unsuccessful, until the 7th round, which was successful).  He has a genetic issue, so there is no way for him to produce viable sperm.  His child was the result of his brother's sperm, and his brother has agreed to donate sperm for us. Another curve ball, his brother lives abroad.

Yet another curve ball, I recently graduated with my MFA and have an exorbitant amount of school debt.  While my partner can help, he isn't made of money, so it is very much a consideration.  I have Aetna insurance which has some fertility benefits, but require 3 rounds of IUI before having IVF and do not cover egg freezing unless it is ""medically necessary"" which usually means it is only available to someone with cancer.

**What I am planning for:** My partner and I wanted to wait two years before we started trying to have a baby, but the news from my various doctors has made it seem like that is not an option.  This is tough because my partner and I haven't been together for very long (6 months) which is why we wanted to wait.  That said, we know ourselves pretty well and feel confident we are a match, so we are currently thinking about two possible scenarios.

1) Have my eggs retrieved and frozen in July 2020, then have IVF in July 2021. *Pros: Time to save $ and buy a house    Cons: Age + Insurance may cover IVF, but not Egg Retrieval and Freezing*

2) Have IVF in July 2020. *Pros: Insurance is more likely to cover    Cons: Our relationship is so new, it seems overwhelming.*

We are considering doing this in NYC where we live, but are also looking at options abroad so that we can cut costs and be closer to his brother.

**My questions:** With my various issues, I am trying to do my best to get my body in it's best possible condition to produce eggs.  I have a very integrated view of medicine and have seen many people have success by combining eastern and western medicine.  I plan to use both acupuncture, Chinese herbs, and diet to get my body to a more balanced place.  

Q1: I went to acupuncture for the first time the other day and literally got my period as I was walking from the acupuncture office to my apartment - but it was two weeks early.  And, despite my PCOS, I am normally like clockwork.  Has anyone had this happen to them?  It seems like a sign that it is working, but I'd love more info if anyone has it.

Q2: I called an acupuncturist today to ask about the price of herbs for fertility and the woman (who is apparently respected in her field) said that herbs would be needed for a minimum of 4 months and each month would cost $2k.  A total cost of $8k seems insane!  Does anyone have experience with herbs?  What should they cost?  Is there anything online that you would recommend or any great doctors who I can call for a consultation?

Q3: Does anyone have any other advice or areas that I should look into?  Books?  Podcasts? Diets? Posts? Ways to stay organized with all of this info?!

Thanks for any insights you may have!

I do have some meds to donate. Normally I would prefer pick up but will ship within the US for no contact :)

Please only claim what you need. 

I have the following:

1 box of Leuprolide Acetate (Lupron). I did open the box and use 4 of the 14 syringes but have extra syringes I will supply you with. I did not open the actual Lupron vial. I just needed extra needles for a different Lupron bottle I had before I acquired the extra syringes. This expires in July 2020. 

3 unopened Progesterone vials. I have a lot of 22g x 1 1/2 inch syringes plus a few 18g left as well that I will supply you with. These expire in April 2022. 

1 5,000 unit vial of Novarel. Box has been opened but nothing has been touched on the inside. I was originally prescribed 10,000 units but got lowered to 5,000... hence the extra vial. I also have the syringe and needles you'll need for this. This expires in August 2020.

Trigger alert - baby loss




I just had my day 21 progesterone test. It said my progesterone level was .53. I did get a positive ovulation test. What could be the cause of low progesterone? I do not have pcos. I am 30 years old. I have one child. however I did get pregnant again last year and had a premature delivery at 6 months. Child did not make it.

My periods have been weird after the loss. I did have my fsh and lh and thyroid checked on day 3 of my cycle and those were normal.

Does this mean I will require hormone therapy for the rest of my life or just when trying to get pregnant? 

Also, could I just get on bc to regulate my hormones after I have another baby.

168,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"TW: CP, mention of other people’s children 

Yesterday I was feeling all good about the fact that our IUI had ended in a very low level CP. I honestly found out in the best way possible. I’d asked my doctor not to call me with beta results on Thursday unless they were positive, then I got my period (two days late) on Saturday. I didn’t get a call from them, and I never tested at home, I’d already accepted this cycle as a failure. At our WTF appointment yesterday to discuss next steps, the doctor asked if I’d gotten my period yet, then let us know that we’d had a chemical pregnancy. I was initially so happy to know that sperm and egg had met & combined and at least made it to implantation to start producing a tiny bit of hcg, which is way further than we’d ever gotten before. We finally knew that our sperm and egg could do something together & I felt like this was just a piece of data meant that when we did IVF with ICSI / PGT next month, we’d have a decent shot.

We called mr. owls mom, just to keep her updated. We told her we had a few mixed emotions, but ultimately it was a good thing & we were viewing it as a positive piece of data. We chatted for a bit, talked about how we might have to reschedule due to COVID-19, but so far are still on the schedule for end of April. She advised us to hold off until this was all over, and I half heartedly agreed.. I know that it’s coming. Then she brought up that my SIL (mr. owls sister) and her husband will be trying again. RIGHT AFTER telling us to wait on treatment because of everything going on. What?! 

SIL will be trying for #3, and her two living children were both conceived cycle 1. SIL has not made any effort to try to empathize with us at all in the last two years, so I’m already bitter about pretty much everything related to her and her family. But when I brought it up that MIL had just advised us to wait but was ok with them trying, she was basically like “well you know how easy it is for them and I wanted to give you a heads up because they’re probably already pregnant. I just didn’t want you to be blindsided”. Ughhhh fuck me. 

So today when I saw the ASRM guideline to postpone upcoming cycles I just lost it. I know it’s the smart thing to do, and it’s probably what we will do (even if our clinic doesn’t force us to) but it’s just not fucking fair my SIL isn’t thinking about whether or not this is “responsible”. And even if she is thinking about that, SHE still has the power to make that choice. I hate that this is one more choice that was taken away from me. And I’m bitter, sad, mad, idk. 

And now that we’re going to have to wait longer, it feels different to find out that we were the closest we’d ever been last month. It makes it that much more infuriating because if it had just fucking worked this time, then I wouldn’t be forced to wait. Again. 

And also side note, wtf is up with the fact that I was told I had a chemical pregnancy and was like “yay!”?! Why do I have to be so hardened and dissociated from this shit in order to protect myself?? What am I doing reassuring my family that this is a good thing? Obviously I have some mixed emotions on this. 

Anyways, I don’t know what I’m really going to get from this, because ultimately my SIL will become pregnant again and I’m going to have to pretend to be happy for her, my IVF cycle will get cancelled, and I’ll still be childless when she welcomes a THIRD baby into their tiny two bedroom apartment.

I am turning to this community for advice since I have a WTF appointment with my doctor coming up on Thursday. I am also posting this as a standalone comment as it will be lengthy and I want to increase visibility. 

As you can see from my flair, I am 33 and have been on my infertility journey for three long years. Prior to commencing treatment, my partner and I had two miscarriages, both ending at 8 weeks. The first was a natural miscarriage and the fetus stopped growing around 6.5 weeks. POC was not tested. Six months after the first miscarriage, I took Letrozole for 3 months, despite regular periods, and only ovulated once on the medication and the cycle was not successful. I went off medication and became pregnant a few months later, one year after the first miscarriage. The second miscarriage resulted in a D&C and an emergency room doctor thought I had a molar pregnancy. The pregnancy was not molar; however, this was not determined until the POC was tested. As a result of the D&C, I ended up with scarring that took a surgery to remove. At this point, my partner and I had met with our RE, but were on hold to start treatment due to the surgeries. 

We completed one unsuccessful IUI with our RE but were told our odds with IUI were the same as TI so we elected to stop treatment for a few months while we saved for IVF. We completed RPL testing and all of our RE tests came back normal, with the exception of high AMH. I enquired about PCOS; however, have been told (a few times) that the only marker I have is high AMH. Due to the miscarriages, we thought our issue was chromosomal abnormalities and that IVF could resolve the issue. 

We went through our IVF with ICSI cycle in April 2019. Results: 51 mature eggs, 18 eggs fertilized, 10 frozen (1 abnormal, 5 normal, 2 untested, 2 no result). Since IVF we have completed two transfers: 1 CP and another miscarriage. The latest miscarriage was difficult since it was a tested embryo and we were on track with great doubling and first ultrasound at 6 weeks. At our 7.5 week ultrasound we were told that growth stopped at 6.5 weeks (again!) and there was no heartbeat. We waited two weeks for a natural miscarriage but ended up taking medication March 1. 

At this point, I do not want to complete another transfer until we can test something else or take another approach since we can't seem to make it past 6.5 weeks (PGS or not). If you have made it this far, I am wondering if there is any advice you can provide or suggested questions for my RE? 

- We have completed all tests except an ERA - which I did not think was needed based on our implantation. 
- I plan to enquire about transferring two embryos (one untested since I can't transfer two PGS).
- I also plan to ask for yet another saline sono to ensure that there are no issues after this last miscarriage. 
- I have to double check if my partner has had a DNA frag test but that would not affect our transfer. 
- We are testing the POC from the last miscarriage and waiting on the results.
- We can't afford another IVF cycle or surrogacy so the embryos we have will be the only ones we can use.

But literally, 5 of my close friends and family are pregnant. Nobody can say the right thing to me and it feels like everyone has some sort of advice but cannot relate. I just want them to listen like I listen to them but lately I want to disconnect. 4 friends offered me their eggs and one offered surrogacy, which is not something I would even need. Plus, we don’t even have a plan at this point. I am not trying to sound ungrateful but I truly don’t believe they mean it and it just comes across to me as ignorant and insensitive. One is only 20 weeks pregnant - how and when could she donate? Does anyone have better luck with support groups? This group has been helpful so thank you!</p>

Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C""). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.

**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process.

This is a **science-minded, realistic, and sometimes cynical sub**. There are many communities online for people who want a more ""positive"" or ""upbeat"" experience complete with baby du$t.  People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic, and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies/cures as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).

Sex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. **Infertility isn't cute**, and neither are the terms we use. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.

**No solicitations** will be allowed for monetary or medication donations. To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result.

233,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone, new to this forum but long time reader. I felt like I needed to tell my story for hope that it would help someone in their journey or after getting some bad news. This isn’t a pity post if anything it’s a story for closure and I hope that someone who is going through a similar story will see it that way too.

Background: I am 31 and my husband is 32 we are both incredibly healthy we started trying in late 2015 then moved to IUI for two years in 2017 then started IVF cycles end of 2019. My cycle is perfect I never miss a beat, every 26 days, my husbands count and motility is great. We just fell into the “unexpected” trap doctors couldn’t figure out what was happening. I never once had a positive test, never had a miscarriage, no chemical pregnancy. Nothing. 

So during our ivf, first round got cancelled I only produced 4 potential follicles and doctor said they can’t move forward with 4 since the embryo would not make it to day 6. So they bumped my meds up to the highest dose and still only produced 4 and the other follicles were actually less this time around. After some further tests the doctor determined that my egg reserve is running out and the quality of my eggs are not good anymore (I’m 31 for crying out loud). So with this news the doctor confirmed that the only other option is using someone else’s eggs, pay for donated embryos or adoption. 

I never thought of the day where I would get a “you can’t have kids” answer, it came out of nowhere and was not expecting that at age 31. It was devastating and was not sure how to process it in the doctors office. I was in shock, I couldn’t believe it. All this time I thought alright ivf medicine and done let’s do it! I’m still young, I have control over this. But nope, I have no control over this and whatever my fate is. 

I’m still processing this news, it’s incredibly hard to think that I won’t ever have kids of my own but slowly I am coming to that idea and I’m okay with it. One thing that I think is very important is to not put so much pressure on yourself. It’s okay. I know it’s easier said than done, but honestly what control do you have? Ultimately, if it is not meant to be then it won’t happen. No reason to keep yourself in a depressed state, just move on to what your fullest potential in life will be. I think once I grasp onto that it will feel good. It’s hard thinking of my life without kids because I have been thinking for 30 years that my life will include kids and now that was torn away from us, just like that, in a 10 minute conversation 30 years of having the idea of a kid is erased. CRAZY!! But now that door is closed and to be honest I’m relieved. Is that weird? Maybe We started preparing ourselves to move on a few months back which I think helped with being blindsided yesterday. 

So, why am I telling my story? I just hope that this can bring an ounce of hope to those who get the same news as me, it’s devastating and comparable to a death, a baby that you never can have. Which when you say it like that, is incredibly painful, but now know that, this door is closed and you can move towards your fullest potential in life without kids or whatever that is meant for you. As hard as that is saying it out loud, it’s okay. Embrace what you have in front of you. I know through this journey me and my husband have been closer than ever before, I would marry him all over again with no regrets. I’m so happy that he keeps assuring me that it’s okay, he is with me for me, and that I can’t beat myself up for it because I can’t fulfill my duty as a woman. Now I understand what it means for women to have super powers, lol as cheesy as that is, having a baby grow inside you and develop into a human being is truly a miracle. The fact that naturally, you have a 20% chance every month of becoming pregnant is so small! 

To anyone out there going through such pain like this, just take it one day at a time. Just know you are so incredibly strong for burdening this pain. In a weird way, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, I feel like I can move on and close this chapter, knowing that I have a healthier marriage now than 5 years ago. It’s so important to keep communication open and really mourn this as well.

Hey, dear people, I wrote down my story. I'm sorry that it is so lenghty. I promise I will never make so many words again. I am just so aroused and confused, that it is still hard to condense it. 

I guess most will get the point pretty soon, it's just a assembly of stories happening over a time. Thank you very much in advance for any kind word. I hope I find some people who understand here. 

It is somehow a case of social infertility. 

Being forty and wanted to have a kid. The last relationship broke because of this. This is 3 1/2 year ago now and that happened: 

As far as I knew we loved each other dearly. And I've been never told anything else by him or any bystander. Everybody told us that we should be so thankful for what we had. So the break up had to be done and given the tragic situation, I of course assumed supportive bahaviour and assuring we both would come out well of this. I thought this was naturalas we loved each other.

This didn't happen. I made my best not to hurt him (he had pre-existing wounds of being left for someone else) and even give him another half year of mine, in which I gave us time to slowely grow apart, to not make it too hard and pay respect to each others feelings. He started to be strange, asked for another talk about our chances, we might have. We met, he was strangely and massively cold, suddenly told me I'd likely have disabled children and that this was a reason to not have kids together. I was in state of shock. Really. Extremely confused and helpless among the monster that was sitting in front of me, that I used to love really dearly.

It went on like this. Snapped at me. 'I'm sorry if I don't think about you all the time' after I sent him happy christmas wishes. Coincidentally met, he hold me tight so long, would'nt let go. Then: 'Sorry, there are no feelings anymore.' Then again cried on my sofa.

A friend of him put me down so cruel. Told me I had no right to be sad.

That was a mayor life crisis already and I needed all my strength to cope with that and bring it to an good end. And my time was valuable.

I was so massively confused by this unreflective, hurtful behaviour. Meanwhile my father had a brain stroke two days before christmas. I was so broken, tried to stand upright for my parents.

Second stroke, third stroke, fourth stroke, that crazy friend told me, he would be there to help me with my father, but not with my grieve about the love lost. As if I had to be punished. For what? 

4 months go by. I was still waiting for my ex to come to a somewhat normal behaviour again, nothing was more important to me as to keep this relationship. It's an awful choice to make between someone you love and kids.                                                                                                                                                      
We meet and he tells me he has someone knew. No warning. No sensitivity towards me. No cooperation. I'm so blindsided. He doesn't want to tell me who. He gets quite squishy and I am  dumbfounded.

Finally: it's the girl he met two weeks prior our break-up, who heavily hit on him and strangely bitched on me, whom we brought home and smirked her goodbye and texted him right the next morning. (We never ever encountered something like that before! That's for me a situation, you undoubtably are loyal to your partner. ) About whom he repeatedly, before and after the break up told me, NOT TO WORRY!! I addressed this several times. 

Shocked I ask since when, he tells something like a month. That is highly untrustworthy. This completely unreliable behaviour. I feel blindsided and gaslighted, but I am not the person to get aggressive. I was just so hurt by this, I was numb.

Again he is quite crazy. He is telling me he is happy. Then freaking as I use the word 'we' (for my sister and me) . 'Who do you mean with 'we'?' And he wants to be friends !!!!

I wanted that all the time. I did everything for that. He comes there, acting like the most irresponsible and unrespectful person I can imagine. Of course that mf had not even made that clear to his girlfriend, that he wanted to meet me. He told her once and she to no much surprise freaked out.

That was against my pride to meet with someone who has treated me like that and then also betray his new girlfriend. I also felt that he is by no means reliable for me and I would again awfully get hurt, when this woman would demand that we cancel contact.

The level of hurt of love and betrayal of friendship and decency I felt at this day was the most awful feeling I ever felt.

I lost it all. I lost this big love and he suddenly developed into an awful enemy. Who hit me to the core. I lost the appreciation I thought he had for me ( don't know, up to this day, everyfuckinbody tells me so). I lost the reliable, cheering friend. I was constantly endangered to lose my father.

Facing a very difficult situation. Full of fear of not having a child. This fear is so painful. Some can understand, a lot of people mock you because of this. 

But the most awful thing was, that I was in incredible disbelief and insecurity about what had happened? Did he even betray me to weeks prior our break up? Did she interfere with his decision. The disrespect to mingle a old love with a new. In such a situation. With so much lying and playing going on. This selfishness. Was our love worth anything? The brainfuck was so cruel. Given all the month prior, my energy to fight the emotions was consumed. He refused to talk to me after that and give me any true information.

I broke down, called suicide hotline, was brought into a hospital, managed to be let out, asked a friend of him for help. Guy told me: yeah, they were hookin up one weak after the break up. That's what he knew. God knows what really happend. Apparentely I was supposed to shrug this off.

I begged him to help me with a clarification as I needed to go on with my life! He refused. My time was running. I was desperate. depressive, on tranquilizers.

I have been a normal person before.

These people consider such a behaviour as normal. I don't. She is an adult ministrant. No lie. A ministrant. A ministrant who shamelessly interferes with a relationship when it comes to having children. And I was supposed to be cold-hearted rational following through with life.  My values are deeply infringed and thus I feel. I got ridiculed, lied to, played with, all to his good, his feelings count, mine don't, does he act unreliable, it is his hurt feelings. I shall stand over this and not complain. After all I want the children! That he couldn't decide for that, seems irrelevant and natural. It was nobodies fault. You want kids or you don't. Nobody was hustled. The decisions were respected.

I felt so deeply betrayed, I,  who had no time, gave him time after the break up and what I got back was being blindsided and played with. Denied clear information and ridiculed me and more or less told me to act like a woman my age should.

Next christmas after a year of developing depression and breakdowns, trying to stand up again, cancer of the bladder was detected in my father. Bigger than a fist. Operation, bladder out. Spring: cancer of the lung. Operation, chemo, radio, immunetherapy. We are fighting all the time. I was still deeply lovesick and disbelief. A devastation that comes when you feel betrayed by humans in general. The hurt, the lack of cooperativeness and basic friendliness and decency in difficult times. I once more got weak and asked for a helping talk. This time I got back a cowboy smiley. A cowboy smiley! This man called me the best friend he ever had. My faith in humans is shredded. My faith in love and friendship is shredded.

After I complained a bit, I got a rant and he told me he doesn't care and has long forgotten this and I shouldn't fantasize this much.

Of course I was not able to build a new relationship. 7 month ago, I finally decided to get a sperm donor. They don't treat single woman here. It's super expensive. I have to go abroad. Some of you surely know:it's a massive strain to hope every month, to endure, that if that asshole wouldn't have treated me like shit, I could have way easier get pregnant at 38. 

I want to die. I beg to die and feel so guilty towards the people that love me. I seriously feel so wrong on this earth, so wrong between so called friends. I can't get over this cruelty. This lack of respect for very important life goals. I try to walk on, but I'm a shell and my most private feelings have been constantly devalued and ridiculed.

Thank you. I know. Awfully long. I could have been a happy person. I had interest in life and I cared for humans. I cared to raise a child and make it happy.

Thank you very very much for reading. Advice and support much needed.

We just had our meeting with the RE yesterday to discuss the first round of testing. I’ve been off birth control since June and we had our first appointment with RE on 1/31. 
I only have one ovary (probably congenital) and that ovary had a 10 cm cyst removed in 2015. So we were pretty sure that’s the problem. Sure enough at my first baseline ultrasound the RE found a 3.5cm cyst taking up 95% of the total surface area on my ovary. She could only see 2 follicles. Thankfully my AMH was higher than predicted at 0.9. And my husbands SA had good results. 
The RE is recommending IVF lite to get more info about whether I can juice up enough follicles to actually use my own eggs. Depending on what she learns from that cycle will decide next steps. It seems like success from this is slim and she was pretty clear that there is very little chance we will have multiples successes without donor eggs. 
I’m pretty numb right now but this is very far away from what we hoped. Like a couple of idiots we went into this pretty sure that we didn’t want to use donor material. Now I just feel lost. We’re also paying for all of this OOP because my insurance doesn’t cover anything. We are very lucky to be able to get financing on terms we can handle, but obviously adding donor eggs will be a big cost. 
Sorry for the long winded intro. I just feel so sad and uncertain of what happens next. Anyone else in the same boat medically? I read some older posts on mini IVF, assuming that’s the same as IVF lite? Anyone going through that now with tips/ commiseration? Weirdly it gives me comfort to think about it as just another testing cycle rather than a possibly successful treatment. Thanks for reading.
