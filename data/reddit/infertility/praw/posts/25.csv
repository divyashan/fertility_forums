The RE suggested that we trigger tonight and wait until my next period to try again. So, I'm about to drive an hour away to pick up a Pregnyl so that I can try this again in a few weeks. I'm so irritated for so many reasons. 
1) I LOVED being able to do this over summer break. I didn't have to worry about sub plans, using sick days, catching up on missed lessons, explaining why I'm always late or leaving early for appointments. I'm getting enough sleep each night and making healthy meals. I'm not stressed out about anything at all. It has been wonderful! This next cycle will be putting me back in the midst of IVF right at the start of the new year. 

2) We did Estrace priming for this cycle. The point was to ensure that all the follicles grew and developed at the same rate in order to create more mature eggs. That was a total loss! Estrace didn't do such a good job, did it? Cause that one follicle took over and screwed it all up. 

3) The next protocol is another 2-cycle protocol, which puts our next ER in September! I was so looking forward to being DONE with this. It's our last round of IVF and we're out until we can afford donor eggs. Fail or not, I was so looking forward to having my life back in July. No more meds, injections, or taking 50 vitamins a night. No more worrying about my diet and exercise. But, now, I've got 3 or more months left. 

4) I have to go another 2-3 months faking happy all the time. I have another 3 months to worry about which one of my friends will announce her pregnancy (I have 5 friends currently trying!!!). I can't even stand being around them when it gets brought up. That excited aura just kills me. 

5) Money. We just lost about $2,000 on meds and will have to pay for the last two appointments out of pocket (so that it doesn't count as cycle 2 on the Attain Program). 

6) Cysts. The last time I took Clomid (2014), I ended up with 4 massive cysts that put me out of the game for 3 months. I was weary about taking Clomid for this cycle but the RE assured me it would be okay because they would drain any cysts during the egg retrieval. Since that's not happening anymore, there is a possibility of cysts forming. What if I have to be put on hold even longer because of Clomid and some damn cysts?

I lost my shit, told her ""sorry, ton of work, too busy"" and even deactivated my FB account.

Then about a week later, I get an email from sort of a mutual friend (definitely more her friend than mine, who is living in a different continent) to see how I was doing and blah blah blah. I just didn't feel like replying, I am not in a social mood these days. A week later I get another text message from the pregnant one ""hey, doing ok? Haven't heard from you!"" and the very next day I get the ""Reminder to RSVP for the baby shower"", I deleted it  but then I went to my trash bin and just hit ""I won't be attending"" and I thought that would stop the madness. 

I will remind you the baby shower is this Saturday, which will be cycle day 1 for me btw! This morning my cell phone rings twice and I missed the call, when I go to see who is calling, Google tells me it was a mutual ex-coworker who moved to a different state about two years ago, very good friends of the pregnant one of course. Why the hell would he be calling my phone? How does he even have my number?

In other reality I would tell you this is all a coincidence, but seriously? That's not right, I totally feel like I am being harassed by this chick. 

I know I shouldn't 'ignore' her, but I am dealing with my own depression right now. I told my husband last night how I just don't want to live anymore if I can't have a baby, I am THAT depressed. And to put up with this on top of my own feelings? Sorry, I just can't. I have bigger problems to deal with right now before I can pick up the phone and say ""I am so happy for you"".

On Monday I went in for my first monitoring and blood work ultrasound where they saw 4 follicles on one side, 2 on the other, with everything where they wanted it measurement wise (under 10 mm).  They also said that with the potential follicles they see I could potentially have 13 on one side and 11 on the other!! Eeek :).

My question is regarding my second monitoring ultrasound tomorrow morning.  Am I past the point where if they were going to have to cancel the cycle they would have already? I'm so worried that we have gone through all this crap just to be put on hold.  On Monday there was no dominant follicle. I guess I'm just wondering if there's a usual/certain point where it looks like egg retrieval is good to go?  Also, unsure if it's important but I they reduced my gonal-f dosage after my monitoring appt Monday.

I've been reading over here for awhile anyway and figured I should introduce myself. Trigger warning, loss (which you probably already figured from where I came from). I'm 36 with mostly normal results. My testosterone was a little high, but that was all. I unfortunately had a D&C on May 22, 2015. The Dr that I went to told me that I had old eggs and that I would miscarry at every appointment. I didn't have any of the signs of bleeding, but there wasn't a heartbeat. After that, I was really depressed and gained a bunch of weight. I also didn't get my period back for 5 months. The Dr closed his practice, so I went back to my old OB and she gave me medroxyprogesterone to restart my cycles. They went back to normal - just a lot lighter. My boyfriend and I continued to try (I do tempt & do opks) with no luck. I went to a new OB (who's wonderful) and she had me try 4 rounds of femara at 2.5 mg. After no success with that - I went to a RE. My OAR was at 10 I believe so they think I have plenty of eggs. However, they did see two small cysts, and then they said I might have a septate uterus. I had my HSG, which really wasn't too bad, and my tubes are clear. 

This next part is what I'm totally freaking out about. I went in for a hysteroscopy and the RE couldn't get the scope in. He tried for about 2 hours and I had numbing on the cervix, as well as a paracervical block put in. They did try to use something to dilate me but it they still couldn't get into my uterus. That was this past Monday and the HSG was that Friday before. The RE said that I could have Asherman's syndrome and that there was a shelf that he couldn't get past. I'm scheduled to go back next Thursday and he's going to try again. It was pretty painful, I didn't cry but I was very dizzy. Does anyone have any experience with this?

I'm 25 and my husband is 26. We've only been trying since January, but it's been a bit of a journey. I got my nexplanon out in January and I was so excited to start trying. My obgyn said that I should ovulate within the week. I temped and tested. And my period never came. In April I was finally given progesterone to jump start my period. My thought was that something with the nexplanon caused me not to ovulate, but maybe a quick jumpstart would help. My next period never came either.

I had my annual on June 7th and my obgyn told me that I was not ovulating since the only period I had in 6 months was medicine induced and very light. He started me on infertility treatments with metfornin for 3 months and another jump start to my period with progesterone. I believe the assumption is that I might have pcos. He didn't run tests because my symptoms line up pretty well and tests cost a lot of money. I'm overweight (bmi 33), with no ovulation, and I've always had a history of very long irregular cycles with heavy periods when I did have them before nexplanon. 

I just got my period from the progesterone and I've noticed my hair on my lip getting lighter but not much else. This period is a lot heavier and I've got symptoms more like my old periods. The doc wants to start me on clomid in 3 months if I don't show signs of ovulation with the metfornin. The dose is only 500mg twice a day though, so I'm not too sure on results. I think I should push for tests though before going straight to clomid. I'm not sure though.

<p>I just got my period from the progesterone and I&#39;ve noticed my hair on my lip getting lighter but not much else. This period is a lot heavier and I&#39;ve got symptoms more like my old periods. The doc wants to start me on clomid in 3 months if I don&#39;t show signs of ovulation with the metfornin. The dose is only 500mg twice a day though, so I&#39;m not too sure on results. I think I should push for tests though before going straight to clomid. I&#39;m not sure though. </p>

I was terrified to meet with him after all my tests, procedures, etc. and anxious to learn my options. 

At first he suggested CC/IUI and superovulation/IUI as good places to start, with 15-16% and 20-26% chance, respectively. THEN he realized my operative report from my tube removal wasn't included in my file, so we had to have that faxed while we were meeting (he kept referring to me as an ""amputee,"" which I found kind of funny). He also did a work up of IVF and my chances there are about 45% (all percentages are based on my infertility factors and success rates at his clinic).

Well, as soon as we got the op report from the tube removal, everything changed. I have adhesions in my uterus and while I still ovulate, don't have Fragile X, etc. he cannot be 100% certain my one tube is even functioning properly. IUI is basically out. He said I could still try it but I don't see the point of throwing $1400-3000 at IUI when my one tube might not even work and I could put that money toward IVF.

So right now, I just don't know. I called my insurance and they said they don't cover IVF or meds so we're looking at $9900 for the procedure and $3000 for meds. We're not independently wealthy, so that's an issue. I'm not opposed to taking out a loan, but now I feel like we're just going to be renting the rest of our lives.

To make matters worse, time is obviously a factor because I have reduced eggs but I'm starting a new job in July. The new job obviously comes with new insurance that likely won't cover me and I'll feel like a POS taking time off for any procedures. 

Now that I know it's kind of my only option, I'm much more amendable to going the IVF route but I'm just upset and tired right now. There's no one I can talk to because most of the people I know think it isn't a huge deal, tell me I can just adopt, or ""it might just happen!""

<p>Turns out, the assisting ob/gyn was NOT covered by my insurance... even though I met her ahead of time, ASKED HER specifically if she accepted my insruance, and she said that she was!</p>

<p>The surgery was in January and that&#39;s when the hospital filed the claim.  We got the bill in February with the itemized break down and in March we paid the co-pay.  Wiped our hands clean because as far as we understood it, everything done and paid for.  Now we all of a sudden have a $8400 bill from this ob/gyn because she waited until March to file, and then it got denied in May.</p>

<p>We spent <strong>months</strong> researching doctors and hospitals that were covered under our insurance and now this?!  When we&#39;re trying to figure out how to pay for IVF (because truth be told, I do not think this IUI worked)?!  This is such bullshit and feels like a scam from the insurance company.</p>

We're unexplained, and agreed with our RE that we'll do one cycle of TI+meds, two IUIs and if none of that works we'll be moving on to IVF. So, cycle 1 begins, I take Clomid, all my ultrasounds are good, I'm scheduled to trigger with Ovidrel late Saturday night and then have 4 days of TI (Saturday to Tuesday). It was my husbands birthday on Sunday, we took Monday off to turn it into a long fun sex-weekend - sounds pretty perfect, right? What could possibly go wrong, right? 

Well, first off on Saturday morning I notice that my CM is seriously weird, like yeast infection weird. I figured it must have been the Clomid. Can't let this stop us, so I find some fluconazole in my stash and take it - it usually clears everything up almost immediately for me, so we wouldn't have to waste any time. Crisis averted! However, the next day I notice that I'm still having a weird burning sensation when I pee. Almost immediately after I realize this a UTI from hell ensues. The kind where I can't even sit or stand from the pain, have a fever etc. So our ""fun and romantic"" Monday turns into me going to the doctor, and coming home with a week of antibiotics that will but of course trigger another yeast infection once I'm done with them. Sex is completely and utterly out of the question right now, and in any case I was supposed to ovulate yesterday based on trigger timing.

I honestly can't even. I haven't had a UTI in several years. And of all days it has to happen on ovulation day of our first treatment cycle. Needless to say I'm pretty sure my body has other things to worry about right now instead of focusing on implantation, so our already slim chance just became virtually non-existent.

We had moved onto IVF after 2 failed IUIs (one did result in a CP) because we were under the impression that our inability to get/stay pregnant was due to a sperm morphology issue. The first IVF failed because I had zero response to drugs - ovaries just didn't do anything after 11 days of stims. 


Our doctor ordered Fragile X and Karyotype testing for me. Results should come back in 2-4 weeks. Here's what we got from our WTF call:


Q: Why did they have us do Fragile X and Karyotype testing? It doesn't look like they are part of the clinic's protocol.
A: These are not tests they normally do. But it looks like I'm not really responding to the meds and my embryology is not preforming. The tests will help ""turn over stones"" to see if there might be an egg issue.


Q: Why do you think there's an egg issue?
A: The fertilization rate was 100%, so they think the sperm are doing ok. With the embryos not dividing, it's hard to know exactly why, but given the less than ideal response to meds after two IVF cycles they think it's an egg issue.


Q: Are there any other tests that can help determine egg vs. sperm issue?
A: There isn't really a test to look at DNA of eggs. Partner's sperm seems to be preforming so they don't think it's a sperm issue after all.


Q: What's the plan for moving forward?
A: Continue on supplements (DHEA, CoQ10) and wait for test results to come back. If it appears there is an egg issue, or premature ovarian failure, it will mean we have to continue to be aggressive. It is also possible we might consider an egg donor at some point.


So....we are going to start our next IVF with our next cycle- with the exact same medication protocol. Partner and I have pre-paid through a success or refund to do 6 cycles, so after a few weeks of retreating to my sadness corner, I feel ready to go back into IVF and try again.


The things we're still wondering about are - could there be some kind of sperm issue we just don't see (partner has a varicocele and I sort of suspect there's a derp sperm situation and surgery wouldn't necessarily increase numbers, but would increase quality)? 

Also, when do we ask for a different medication protocol? I'm thinking we do the same meds again because sometimes you can get a different result with the same meds, and ask about changing with IVF #3 if we have to...But I'm starting to research low meds response and it seems there are other issues with over-stimulating the ovaries when you have low AMH. Could the high amounts of meds have made my eggs shit with that last IVF? Could that be why they arrested?


Ultimately, our doctor feels we can get there, but I'm still a little freaked out that they think I may be moving into premature menopause. It sort of attaches a deadline to all this...like I didn't already feel enough things were out of my control/ going wrong...

For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.

For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on /r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, /r/InfertilityBabies. Of course, you are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences (and continue to support other community members) here on /r/infertility.

Negative results are also welcome here, though they need not be confined to this thread. Members with questionable results who want immediate support, and those who need their follow-up questions to be open to greater and faster readership are, as always, welcome to post freely on the main board.

It has been awhile since I have posted and this is a 2 part post.

 Part one: I took this round of Clomid cd 3 - 7 and have felt zero side effects. The first round I took 5 to 9 and had a lot of side effects and got pregnant but unfortunately it was ectopic. Today is CD14 and still no pos opk and I have had a little light pink spotting all day. Is the spotting something to be concerned about? Could it mean I'm going to ovulate the or am I just fucked and it's not working? I Od late the first time on day 19, but this time around as of now the opks are extremely faint lines. I'm really driving myself crazy thinking this month is a wash. 

Part two: I just needed to vent because I'm laying in bed so frustrated with dh. We have to have timed intercourse obviously and last night and tonight he has been too tired to have sex. I understand because he works long hours but it also makes me feel like he isn't taking this as seriously as me. I have to pump my body with these artificial hormones and I don't want it to be for no reason. I just feel like he doesn't get it. he says he gets it and wants a baby really bad too but when this happens I can't help but feel a little defeated/frustrated.

Back story: despite having had my period an an initial drop in HCG at 6w4d, My HCG came back rising at 7w3d and ultrasound showed nothing visible in utero.  HCG was still rising at 7w5d, so the doc prescribed methyltrexate (mtx).  And here's where the suprise was:  I couldn't just go to my doc's office to get the shot, he had to refer me to the cancer center at the local hospital  where he has admitting privileges.  I went over there, they did a raft of blood work (mostly related to kidney function) and when it came back clean, maybe 90 minutes later, I got two shots in the ass and it was done.  The worst part of the actual procedure was the cancer center itself.  It smelled like sickness - like disinfectant and rotten eggs.  I was also kind of disappointed that my doc wasn't there.  I kinda feel like...you started this bro, you should end this.  (am i sick?)

Mentally I was fine until I walked out of the hospital.  We've known she wasn't likely viable since the beginning, And this is hopefully one step closer to being out of limbo.

ANYWAY, I've got some catholic guilt going one, despite the fact that I never hesitated to agree with my doctor to do MTX over surgery).  But never in a million years think it would apply to me.   So the fact that I was in a catholic hospital getting MTX for an ectopic felt very ironic in an Alanis Morisette sort of way.

124,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"To recap: 

First round: estrogen priming, then menopur, follistim, ganirellex. Made it to trigger with 6 follicles, which promptly all either died or ovulated before we got to retrieval. Retrieval cancelled.

Round 1, take two: lupron demi-halt protocol. Lupron, follistim, viagara. Two follicles at retrieval --> one embryo in the freezer. One embryo is better than zero embryos but this was still kind of a crap result.

Obviously for round two, we want the follicle numbers of the first try, with the eggs-not-bailing-out-before-retrieval quality of round 1.5.

So now we're going to do estrogen priming and viagra again, with less estrogen, followed by follistim, menopur, omnitrope (?), centrotide. My nurse called me ""31 flavors"" because she's ordering so many meds.

I know this is and ever shall be an extremely expensive crapshoot, and I am on board with whatever my RE wants to try, but I just want some hand-holding and/or insight from you guys. I feel like both of these protocols have let me down and I am nervous about trying either again.

Also (and CW: rape here), doing the viagra suppositories last round had the lovely added benefit of bringing up a sexual assault from long ago, which I then could not stop raging out about for the entire three weeks I was on viagra. Like I woke up in the morning fucking hating this guy every day and fantasized about hurting him nonstop, after barely thinking about this episode for years and years. (Not helpful that the whole Stanford rape trial thing happened during this, and all my social media became 100% RAPE NEWS RAPE LETTER RAPIST MUG SHOT RAPE JUDGE all day every day.) I told the RE about this and she said I could just do viagra for a week instead of forever. Anyone have insight around this?

So my cycle update so far: I did 7.5mg of Femera days 4-9, had nothing measurable at my first monitoring apt on day 11, and then went back today on day 13 and have one 12mm follicle on my left side. So, now I go back on Monday for another check to see how much it’s grown by then. My RE’s nurse seems to think it WILL grow just because it has thus far, so we will see. If it’s 15 or 16mm I’ll come back the next day for another check, if it’s 17mm I will trigger with Ovidrel the next day, and if it’s 18+ I will trigger that day. So far this is following the exact same course as my last (and only successful) Femera/IUI cycle when I got pregnant with my 21 month old daughter. That time, I triggered on cycle day 17, and did my IUI on cycle day 19. I just go slower than most people it seems. 

I need to figure out the timing of timed intercourse after that, since I’ve always done IUIs before. I’m guessing 36 hours, and then just keep doing it as frequently as possible after that?

Of course, to throw a wrench in things (there’s always a wrench, right?) I am supposed to go on a girl’s trip to Nantucket with four friends next Wednesday-Friday. Already bought and paid for, but unless this cycle ends up being a complete bust and the follicle hasn’t grown at all on Monday, I don’t think that will be happening.

No spotting at all- is currently day 34 of my cycle.  I&#39;m a 28-29 cycle kind of girl, always. Even during all my femara and ovidrel IUI cycles.</p>

<p>Edit: evidently this happens sometimes where the period just doesn&#39;t show up?! Either way, stims start tomorrow night yay!!</p>

I am 30 years old diagnosed with PCOS. I had one pregnancy last year (with Clomid) that evolved into a ruptured ectopic that required emergency surgery and removal of my left fallopian tube. I waited a year to heal and now hubs and I are trying again. 

So, basically after going to RE to check labs, have sperm analysis and HSG, the labs and SA are fairly normal, HSG shows scarring in my one and only fallopian tube. RE says my two options are these. 

* Option 1, hysteroscopy - is 70% covered by insurance. If she is able to clear out the scar tissue, I would just try letrozole to ovulate and get pregnant. Much cheaper. Problem is if she can't do anything it's IVF anyway.

* Option 2, IVF - not covered in any way, shape or form by my insurance. We would basically need to get a loan. I am applying for grants but they don't give money until next year. Cost out-of-pocket would be for one cycle is $9900 not including medications.

I really don't want to do hysteroscopy with the chance that she can't fix anything, I'll be delayed in starting IVF. On the other hand, if she can and I can just take meds, that would be fantastic.

In a nutshell: picture a person in crisis at the center of a series of concentric circles. Each increasingly larger circle is populated by people at an increasing social distance from the central person.  People on a given circle are allowed to rant, complain, or ask for support to anyone on a larger circle, and people on larger circles are supposed to send comfort and listening ears in while saving their own complaints for anyone on their ring or a larger one.

The idea being: it's a faux pas when you rant about how a given crisis is impacting you to someone on a smaller circle / to someone who is closer to the epicenter of the crisis than you are.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've had problems with an immediate family member not getting this fairly basic idea throughout my life. Somehow, I've wound up over and over comforting this relative on how upset events that center on *me* makes *her* feel. It's not consistent or pervasive, but has been consistent enough I know what to look for and generally know how to protect myself emotionally. And yes, I've found the [/r/raisedbynarcissists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/) to be on the nose.

Over the last year or two, I opened up a few discrete times to this relative about what my partner and I are going through. It's been a clusterfuck each time, to the point that I've stopped telling her anything infertility-related as a means of emotionally protecting the two of us. 

She's said things like:

- ""You shouldn't be sad - you should have a joyful heart"" *(No, I'm upset right now and that's okay.)*  

- ""You should focus on being a good aunt to..."" *(As in, I shouldn't yearn to be a mother and just live in the moment, being grateful for the children I do have access to....those children being other people's children...W-T-ever-loving-F.)*

- ""You should NOT be jealous of your sister!!!  That's wrong!!!"" *(After saying that yeah...I love my younger sister and her kids, but her popping out numerous beautiful children effortlessly is occasionally a bit hard to handle.)*

- Upon my posting something on Mother's Day that alluded to those for whom Mother's Day is difficult, and her co-opting that publicly to comfort those who have lost mothers, and my saying ""well...there's other people I was referring to, too"".  Her aggressive phone-call response in a nutshell: ""What? Who else has a problem with Mother's Day?  YOU have a mother...I don't anymore....I'm upset, I miss my Mom...YOU?...why are you upset?...oh come on, just tell me! I'm not a mind-reader...""

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the past hour, I've just come off a call with another relative (the obvious ""they've been talking"" surrogate of the first relative) about how boxed out of my life this first relative feels.  It's a justifiable stance, as yes - that's exactly what I've done. What she doesn't know about my emotions or my medical procedures can't be discussed, judged, or spread to any of her ""prayer warrior"" gossip partners.  Added bonus that I can't tell any of them about IVF anyways, as they're Catholic and I'm not.

The call was full of guilt, but it rolled off me like I'm made of teflon and I feel equal parts triumphant and righteous. This is **my** crisis, **my** body, **my** marriage, **my** partner, and ultimately, **my children.** Blood (or age) doesn't ensure that someone knows how to behave, and damn fuck it all - my feelings about my infertility matter more than her feelings on the subject.

<p>In a nutshell: picture a person in crisis at the center of a series of concentric circles. Each increasingly larger circle is populated by people at an increasing social distance from the central person.  People on a given circle are allowed to rant, complain, or ask for support to anyone on a larger circle, and people on larger circles are supposed to send comfort and listening ears in while saving their own complaints for anyone on their ring or a larger one.</p>

<p>The idea being: it&#39;s a faux pas when you rant about how a given crisis is impacting you to someone on a smaller circle / to someone who is closer to the epicenter of the crisis than you are.</p>

163,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello out there. This is my first post, ever. I don't have facebook and have shared my infertility issues with only a couple people in my life. I hope I follow all the rules right and am in the right place.

Brief as can be about me - I'm a 38 year old woman who's been trying for 6 1/2 years to conceive. I've had 2 chemical miscarriages and D&Cs. One after Christmas 2011, and one the day before Thanksgiving 2012. I had an early labor due to dilated cervix at exactly 23 weeks in 2013 to my loving son who lived for 52 days. Last year my husband and I began IVF after we didn't have any luck with all the other fertility treatments. Up to today I've had 4 retrievals and 2 failed transfers. The last 2 retrievals have come up empty. PGD tested abnormal both times for the single embryo that makes it to day 5. My primary diagnosis is low follicle count. 

Alright so where's some sort of good in all this? We still have 2 healthy frozen embryos. My husband and I love each other and are still together after an infant loss and infertility. We have health insurance that pays for meds and procedures, although we are reaching our max annual amount of fertility coverage since we've done so many procedures this calendar year. I've got 1 major procedure be it retrieval or transfer left in my insurance allowance. I'm coming close to facing I may have to pay out of pocket for the remainder of this year and I would like to share what my options are. Oh, options are a good thing too. 

Where I'm at right now - I'm meeting with my doctor today in a couple hours to discuss next steps. I can either do a retrieval, which I've already come to terms would be my last one. I'm ok with that. I can also throw caution to the wind, let the chips fall where they may and implant my last two and be done. We’ve only implanted one at a time because I’m very high risk now so my doctor is against implanting 2, but with 1 procedure left I’m giving serious thought to implanting 2. The option that seems more responsible/smart is another retrieval because eggs expire. I can’t even think that far out right now if or not I’d implant frozen on day 5 or fresh (if I have any) on day 6. Part of me wants to never give up on having my own baby and part of me also feels like it’s down to the wire decision making time. Listening to my intuition isn’t that easy when there are so many possibilities. Not to mention going through IVF I’ve experienced ANYTHING can happen! I batted 100% my first 2 retrievals with 4 healthy embryos total. Science is not a guarantee. 

More than anything I wanted to share with other people some of my story and hope in any capacity I can be of help to others. We're a tribe of our own.

So we have an appt tomorrow to make sure all is ok after my D&C and talk about our next IVF steps for cycle 3. 

I think I'm going to push pretty hard to do FETs with PGS moving forward, because I want to do everything possible to reduce the chances of another miscarriage. 
We are also going to do genetic testing on me and my husband, and in a couple weeks we'll have results back from the MC testing, so we should know why that happened. So we'll have a lot more info for this round.

But now I'm also wondering if I should push to check if there is some kind of uterine implantation issue. We had 3 3-day embryos and then 3 5-day embryos implanted across the two fresh cycles, and one 5-day worked. Considering we have MFI and no known issues on my side, shouldn't at least one more have implanted? I mean, even just to get a slight beta rise, not necessarily a viable pregnancy. 
Has anyone discussed anything regarding implantation issues/rates before?

I do have (controlled) autoimmune hypothyroid, so maybe there is something immunological going on..

My thinking is FET might help implantation - based on what I've read of the uterus being more receptive when not hopped up on the stims. The fact that we never had anything make it to freeze is definitely worrying too.

Anything else you guys think I should ask?
Has anyone been told FETs aren't a good option for them for some reason?

**Update** 

Two good things - all looks ok post D&C, and we found out we had more frozen sperm meaning no biopsy needed for my husband. (cue very happy husband)

Husband got blood drawn for karyotyping. I have to wait a month before blood draw for mine to make sure all pregnancy hormones are gone.
I'll also do a repeat loss panel, even though I had just the one loss. Taking no chances! My thinking is since I might not have luck with freezing and PGS, I'll do all the pre-testing I can.

Two Bad things - 
Since I have to wait to do the RLP/Karyotyping and then wait again for results, I might not get to start again with my second period. Hopefully the timing will work out.

Also, I forgot my list of questions I made from your responses below.  Doc did say he'd recommend same fresh transfer protocol as last time, unless one of these tests shows something. So I'm guessing he doesn't think we'll have an easy time making it to freeze. But obviously I need a clear answer on that. When we go back for miscarriage results in a few weeks, I'm going to delve into more about our options for frozen, etc. If we end up having all normal test results, including those done from the mc, then I'm ok with a fresh transfer again.

My thinking is FET might help implantation - based on what I've read of the uterus being more receptive when not hopped up on the stims. The fact that we never had anything make it to freeze is definitely worrying too.

Anything else you guys think I should ask?
Has anyone been told FETs aren't a good option for them for some reason?

<p>I think I&#39;m going to push pretty hard to do FETs with PGS moving forward, because I want to do everything possible to reduce the chances of another miscarriage. 
We are also going to do genetic testing on me and my husband, and in a couple weeks we&#39;ll have results back and should know what caused the mc. So we&#39;ll have a lot more info for this round.</p>

<p>But now I&#39;m also wondering if I should push to check if there is some kind of uterine implantation issue. We had 3 3-day embryos and then 3 5-day embryos implanted across the two fresh cycles, and one 5-day worked. Considering we have MFI and no known issues on my side, shouldn&#39;t at least one more have implanted? I mean, even just to get a slight beta rise, not necessarily a viable pregnancy.

We first went to the RE in April after a semen analysis by my regular gyno came back with some troubling results (9 million sperm with only 1 million mobile). We had our first appt with the RE in early April and they did some bloodwork on my husband and it came back that he has high prolactin levels and low testosterone levels.

He's known since basically day one of our relationship of my fertility problem (we started out as friends so the information came out quickly). He said that he wanted to help me, so we haven't been using condoms the whole time. 

At the same time, he has never come to a doctor's visit with me. It is somewhat understandable because we are also sadly in a long-distance relationship and limit our visits to weekends, usually. My doctor has been putting more and more pressure on me to get him to come in so that there can be 1. a semen analysis and 2. a discussion of what my next steps should be.

I started asking him to come about 3 months ago and he said he would get around to it (he needs to see a doctor first to get a referral.)

Now I am pressuring him and asked if he could schedule an appointment in the next few days, and he got angry and defensive and said that no, he would not. 
It is true he is very busy, and that he hates doctors in general. He also blamed me for arguing too much with him over this past weekend (it is true that the relationship is rocky right now, I am often very upset over both this issue and that we are still long-distance).

<p>At the same time, he has never come to a doctor&#39;s visit with me. It is somewhat understandable because we are also sadly in a long-distance relationship and limit our visits to weekends, usually. My doctor has been putting more and more pressure on me to get him to come in so that there can be 1. a semen analysis and 2. a discussion of what my next steps should be.</p>

<p>I started asking him to come about 3 months ago and he said he would get around to it (he needs to see a doctor first to get a referral.)</p>

<p>Now I am pressuring him and asked if he could schedule an appointment in the next few days, and he got angry and defensive and said that no, he would not. 
It is true he is very busy, and that he hates doctors in general. He also blamed me for arguing too much with him over this past weekend (it is true that the relationship is rocky right now, I am often very upset over both this issue and that we are still long-distance).

So yesterday, my husband's mother went to a psychic.  I got a voice message from her that was a little hard to understand, but she said something like, ""Don't worry, there will be children.""  (She didn't mention the psychic on the message, so I had no idea what she was talking about.) Okay...  

I called her back and she was so excited about her visit with the psychic, so I was being enthusiastic back and then she says, ""And you just need to relax and not think about it.  It's going to happen.  You're going to have children.  You're not as infertile as you think.""  Seriously, *""YOU'RE NOT AS INFERTILE AS YOU THINK.""*  To which I said something like, ""Well, I'm completely infertile.  I have no fallopian tubes.  There's no way I can get pregnant without major medical intervention.""  She was like, ""Well, I know but..."" and then she just kept telling me not to think about it and how I just need to live my life and it will happen when I least expect it, don't stress about it, etc. etc. etc.  To which I was like, ""Well, it's kind of hard not think about it when you're getting shots/taking meds/getting twat-wanded all the time.""  Which she mostly dismissed.  Also, she kept saying ""there will be *children*,"" as in plural and eventually she said that by children, she meant twins.  Well, I have one embryo left.  One.  Neither of my other two PGS perfect embryos implanted, so yeah, I have *one*.  Which she knows! I know that there's a possibility that it could split and we could have twins, but we were insanely excited about the idea of having twins when we put in our two embryos for FET #1 and were fucking devastated when it didn't work.  Which she knows.  So, just to protect myself, I'm barely allowing myself to believe that our final FET might work at all, let alone the incredibly remote idea of twins.  So to hear her saying that on top of everything else is just so painful.  

I reminded her of how we only have one embryo left and how unlikely it was to have twins, and how we have to be prepared that it may not work at all, and she went into a thing about if that happens, how we just have to move forward and live life and not be sad, etc. etc. etc.  To which I said, for me, being sad is part of it and how grieving that loss is the only thing that will allow me to ever be able to move forward.  

I don't know, the whole thing was so difficult.  She was excited and I didn't want to shit on her parade, but man, talking about it *at all* is just really hard, let alone that bullshit.  ""You're not as infertile as you think.""  Come *on*, really?  How can you say that to me?  

There was a whole other part about maybe trying one more fresh IVF if this FET doesn't work and she was just acting like that would be super easy, to which I had to explain the financial difficulty that would present after we've already spent so much, and how also I'm 40 now, and I was a low responder for the first two IVFs, and how my AMH/FSH have lowered/risen dramatically and how all indications point to a low ovarian reserve and how we might not even get anything if we tried again, let alone the massive emotional toll this all takes.  Fuck.  

She's a doctor, btw, so you'd think she would have brushed up on this stuff a bit before declaring how easy it would be to just try one more time and how it would probably work with fewer meds and how the REs don't really know what they're doing (yeah, she said all that).  I know she means well, but I... I just can't.  She and her wife are visiting a few weeks from now, after I've started Lupron and Estrace, and I just hope I can keep it together.  She has a tendency to act like every problem in life has an easy breezy solution, and often brushes over important details.  Like, you know, finding another $15 grand.  Or fallopian tubes.   She often shrugs and goes, ""Oh well, you'll figure it out"" to major situations.  Which I guess always ends up being true in a way, but she can just be a bit insensitive.  

At least she gives a shit.  In contrast, my husband's dad and stepmother, who have a 12 year old from IVF after six years of trying, so you think would maybe have a clue how to treat us, didn't even respond to the email we sent them both coming out with our infertility.

It's been this way since we moved here in January, though they've switched spots. They're not pushy, I've only ever noticed them engaging in conversation with people who seem interested, and they've never personally addressed me. But they have these two stands with booklets. One of them just says something along the lines of ""The Bible Saves"" or whatever, but the other one has ""The answer to all your life's questions"" written in large letters across the front.

On off days, I just want to go and shout at them. That 10 page booklet has the answer to all my big questions right? How on EARTH do you explain in under ten pages why we, two responsible twentysomethings who so desperately want to be parents, who have steady jobs, financial security, a four bedroom house and a social network, cannot conceive a baby for the life of us, while every day there are so many people who unintentionally fall pregnant, who abhor the idea of having kids, who are devastated and go through the trauma of abortion, or who keep the child but can't give it what it needs or even worse, who neglect and/or abuse their children? There is NO satisfactory answer to that question, or any of my other big life questions. Sure, you may have an answer like ""Because the universe sucks and wanting something really hard is not enough."" or ""Because God is a moron that doesn't give a fuck about the happiness of humans."" or even ""Because life isn't fair and crying about it won't change a thing."" but you don't need ten pages for that.

Just... They look so smug, standing there with their booklets with the answer to all of my questions. On days like today, it makes me want to rip them all apart. You have no answer for me. Go exist somewhere else please, stop being so in my face.

They&#39;re not pushy, I&#39;ve only ever noticed them engaging in conversation with people who seem interested, and they&#39;ve never personally addressed me. But they have these two stands with booklets. One of them just says something along the lines of &quot;The Bible Saves&quot; or whatever, but the other one has &quot;The answer to all your life&#39;s questions&quot; written in large letters across the front.</p>

<p>On off days, I just want to go and shout at them. That 10 page booklet has the answer to all my big questions right? How on EARTH do you explain in under ten pages why we, two responsible twentysomethings who so desperately want to be parents, who have steady jobs, financial security, a four bedroom house and a social network, cannot conceive a baby for the life of us, while every day there are so many people who unintentionally fall pregnant, who abhor the idea of having kids, who are devastated and go through the trauma of abortion, or who keep the child but can&#39;t give it what it needs or even worse, who neglect and/or abuse their children? There is NO satisfactory answer to that question, or any of my other big life questions. Sure, you may have an answer like &quot;Because the universe sucks and wanting something really hard is not enough.&quot; or &quot;Because God is a moron that doesn&#39;t give a fuck about the happiness of humans.&quot; or even &quot;Because life isn&#39;t fair and crying about it won&#39;t change a thing.&quot; but you don&#39;t need ten pages for that.</p>

<p>Just... They look so smug, standing there with their booklets with the answer to all of my questions. On days like today, it makes me want to rip them all apart. You have no answer for me. Go exist somewhere else please, stop being so in my face.</p>

Since starting all this IF bullshit in January, I've stopped running. Now, my friends are doing 5ks, triathlons, 10ks, obstacle courses, and all kinds of other fun things while I sit back and jab myself with needles.

I know my wife reads this sub regularly but is too shy to post (hi honey).  We really like this sub though and appreciate all the fine folks here posting their stories, experiences, and wisdom.  I thought it was long past time to finally say howdy, especially since we're far along the IVF path now.

What to say about our story?  I suppose we're like a lot of couples here.  I'm 34 (35 in a month), my wife is 33 (34 in September), and we've been married for coming up 5 years (together for 10).  We're busy professionals who have moved to 4 cities in 8 years.  We've always wanted children but for one reason or another, it just wasn't a good time.  We don't have any regrets about choices we've made and we're very happy people, but infertility did hit us pretty suddenly and surprisingly.  We would have tried earlier but my wife was hit with serious thyroid issues over the last few years, including radiation treatment which basically locked us down for two full years.

We were trying for a good year and it wasn't easy since I was commuting from another city on the other side of the continent but we definitely tried.  Predicting kits, temperature checks, etc.  We knew enough to know something was up and so we started seeing a REI.  Blood work, ultrasounds, HSG, and SAs later, we were diagnosed with ""unexplained"" infertility which was both disappointing and relieving.  Disappointing to have no idea what was wrong, but relieving to know it wasn't something extremely serious or end-of-the-roading.

We did two IUIs without success (learning that it basically gave us a 8% chance or 92% failure percentage) before deciding that we were going to move straight on to IVF.  We linked up with a new clinic on our REI's recommendation as she couldn't fit us into her schedule (and our schedule).  My wife was on medication and monitoring for pretty much all of May.  We had our retrieval on June 4.

It's been quite a roller-coaster since we started IVF.  In addition to the stress and anxiety of the monitoring process we also stressed about acquiring prescriptions (including getting a bunch from Canada as we're in the US).  Stressed about our chances with IVF.   Stressed about if and how to tell our friends and family.  You guys know the drill.  We were especially stressed when at the beginning of May our REI said we were looking at 10 eggs - 7 on one side and 3 on the other, also hidden behind a cyst.  We were worried that this was kind of low.

We got thrown a monster curve ball mid-way in the month too.  My wife tested positive as a carrier for a genetic condition which meant I would need to get tested too.  Three days before retrieval we got my results and I was also a carrier.  We calculated we had about a 1 in 1000 chance that we would both carry it (plus I also carry achondroplasia - yay) so we won a craptastic lottery.  This completely messed up our planning, including any chance of a transfer until any embryos could get screened (a few months).  

Fortunately, our retrieval went well. They managed to recover 19 eggs which kind of blew our minds given our original 10 count expectation.  The folks at our clinic were really wonderful and super kind to us.  I got to use a ""collection room"" for the first time.  That was an interesting experience.  The lab was right next to the recovery area so we got to see the embryologists immediately get to work doing their thing.

They called us later in the day that 12 eggs were mature enough to fertilize.  We got some good news a few days ago that they successfully fertilized 10 with ICSI.  We wanted to try and let me sperm fertilize it naturally but because of the biopsy requirement, it was only going to be ICSI (so as not accidentally biopsy a stuck sperm).  The day 3 assessment was 7 ""excellent"", 2 ""good"", and 1 ""meh"" (my word, not theirs).  Today is our day 5 and we're on pins and needles waiting to see what happens.  Since we need to do biopsies for PGD, it's so critical how many we've got left to work with.  My fingers are crossed...

At this point we're waiting to see how things go and then trying to make the next decision.  How many suitable embryos will we get?  Should we do another round of IVF (retrieval) before attempting to transfer?  Our thinking is that if we end up with only 1 or 2 embryos after PGD inevitably selects out the bad ones, should we try and get some more?  If we go right to transfer and we're lucky enough to get pregnant, do we base our try for another child on just one more embryo?  That will be at least another year later, meaning ovarian reserve is an issue...  Oh and I forgot to mention we are moving cities too.  Sigh...decisions.

I just want to get back to it as soon as I can - I feel so much better thinking about being able to try again.

Our first 2 cycles were fresh cycles back to back - both times they transferred 3 embryos. First IVF was a day 3 transfer, second was a day 5. No PGS. First time had 10 eggs fertilized, second was 9, and we never had anything left to freeze. One of those second cycle Day 5 blasts was the one that implanted.

We are waiting on testing from that loss to see if there is some other issue going on we need to consider, so I know that could change things. But assuming it was considered a one-off thing, what would you push for if you were in my shoes?

I have a feeling that my RE will suggest a day-5 fresh cycle again because it worked before. 

But I'm leaning toward doing PGS. I'm 36 and now have had a mc, and I'm willing to do what I can to reduce my chances of ever going through that kind of heartbreak and loss again. I also would really, really like to have some frozen ones to potentially use in the future also. (obvs we all would!)

But then what worries me most is attempting to do a PGS/freeze all cycle and ending up with nothing ever making it to freeze, and making that mistake a few times. And losing more time, and more money....

My RE would like me to wait 2 periods before doing a transfer again, to let my uterine lining regrow after the D&C. I'm going to ask him if that means that after 1 period, I could still do a freeze all cycle, since there is no option for transfer. That could make the decision for me at least for my next round, unless the damn vacation I had just booked for last 10 days of July makes me miss that cycle. Dammit.

Besides that, I'm inclined to ask to do all PGS/frozen cycles moving forward. It pains me to think that could make it many more months before I get to the point of an actual transfer. But then again, I might thank myself later if we have tested embryos banked. 
Or, maybe I should still with what worked since a fresh cycle has been proven to work for me.

I'm all over the place.

We learned so much and the doctor was amazing!

Turns out he is healthy and according to his hormones his body is pretty happy. He has a small varicocele (grade 2) which he could have removed. There likely were some complications from having mumps as a baby which are causing all these problems. The urologist isn't too concerned about his morphology, just his count.

Treatment is to go on Clomid for a couple of months to see if it increases his count. Surgery may help, but that would take even longer as the wait for surgery is a couple months. 

We were all ready to do an IUI this month but we are now thinking we should hold off for a couple months before starting to let the Clomid work it's magic. Since I am of advanced maternal age :), I am a little worried about waiting another couple months, but figure it probably makes more sense to just enjoy the summer.

I've been reading your posts for a couple of months and credit to you all this is a very supportive group given the isolation we all feel .

Our story (I'm the husband) - I'm 35, Mrs. B is 34. TTC 1.5 years. We figured it was Mrs B. who was having issues ovulating or whatever. Turns out it was me all along because when we went to the RE in March and did a sperm analysis he couldn't find any . Not one. I went to the urologist last week for more tests and the expectation is that I have non-obstructive azoospermia due to a varicocele that developed following an infection (orchitis) 5 years ago. Devastating news and really limits our options. Though in a way not having options is a bit of a relief - we may not have to spend so much time on  isci with Ivf . We can't afford it anyway .

I've recently been diagnosed with unexplained infertility and was prescribed clomid and the trigger shot. I start off with 50mg's from cd 3-7. I just finished my last pill and go for my ultrasound in a few days. If this cycle doesn't pan out my doctor has doubled my dose of clomid and I start the process over again. I posted on r/stilltrying and someone suggest I make my way over here. 

I naturally ovulate on my own and have regular cycles that are approx 25 days Long with about 2-4 days of spotting before my period starts. I've been trying since February 2015 with absolutely no luck. I've been seeing a gyno who specializes in infertility and haven't got a referral for a RE. 

My question: I was reading the info packet that comes with the clomid, it says that if ovulation occurs the while on the 50mg dose, increasing the dose will not increase its effectiveness. Will the extra 50 mg's be pointless for me? Does anyone else have similar experience/scenario to mine? Or can provide some insight.

After the surgery, the doctor came to my recovery bed to let me know that I did indeed have endometriosis. Lots of it. Stage III or IV. He said I'd obviously had it for a very long time. That it has likely been the cause of our infertility.


He asked me, ""Haven't you been in pain?"" 


Of course I've been in pain. I've been in pain for 16 years.


Once in Jr. High my cramps were so terrible that halfway through the day I just laid down on a mat in the PE room and sobbed in pain until my mother could come pick me up. The next day when I came back to school my friends told me a rumor had gone around saying I'd died.


The diagnosis: bad cramps. My mom's OBGYN told me to take a couple of pain killers the day before my period started and to use a heat pad.


My freshman year of college I had to miss a final because the cramps were so debilitating that I fell to the floor after getting out of the shower and couldn't get back up.


The diagnosis: bad cramps. The RN put me on birth control so that I only had periods four times a year. 


Almost 5 years ago, my husband and I decided to try to start our family. I got off birth control. The cramps weren't as bad as before but I had very painful bowel movements and even blood in my stool. Intercourse, especially at ovulation, became very painful.


The doctor said I had a cyst on my left ovary but it was nothing to worry about. No diagnosis. Just try not to have my husband penetrate deeply and make sure to drink water to keep my bowel movements smooth.


A year and a half with infertility. Told the doctor about my history of painful cramps and pain during intercourse. The doctor's course of action? Track your temperature on a chart and come in when your temperature peaks for a PCT (for those of you who don't know: Post-Coital Test. The woman comes in one hour after sex, the doctor extracts semen from her vagina, and analyzes sperm mobility. But why would you know? Real REs and OBGYNs haven't used that test since the 90s). 


The diagnosis? Mobility is a little low so let's do IUI without running any other tests. I didn't bother moving forward with him but we were students and our insurance was limited to the student health center. We had nowhere else to go.


I tried holistic approaches. Lost weight. Ate paleo. Pelvic massages. Nothing.


Two years later I had a full time job with great insurance. I went to my old OBGYN. He knew my history of bad cramps. He knew about my cyst. He ordered blood work. Everything's normal. He ordered a semen analysis. Normal. He ordered an HSG. Normal. He says we have undiagnosed infertility and puts me on Clomid. No pregnancy but plenty of emotional mayhem. He tells us IVF is likely our only path to pregnancy.


We moved to Canada for my husband's PhD. Once again on student health insurance. I went to a walk-in clinic, hoping to get a referral to a specialist for infertility. Told them my symptoms. Same blood work. Still normal. Ultrasound: 4cm^3 cyst on my left ovary. Probably nothing. Undiagnosed infertility.


I was desperate. I looked up causes of infertility online. I found the symptoms of endometriosis:

Painful cramps: check

Painful intercourse: check

Painful ovulation: check

Painful bowel movements/urination: check

Blood in stool/urine: check

Ovarian cysts: check

Infertility: check


Armed with a self-diagnosis, I went back to the clinic, listed off my symptoms, and asked to be referred to a gynecologist. The gynecologist referred me to an RE who then referred me to a surgeon and that's how I ended up lying in that hospital bed a week and a half ago.


The surgeon said we have a good shot at getting pregnant without IVF now. But I'm angry.


I'm angry at the doctors who didn't take me seriously as a young woman in pain.


I'm angry at the doctors who were too lazy or incompetent to diagnose my obvious disease.


I'm angry that it took ten doctors and five years to finally get surgery.


I'm angry. They stole years of my life away. If I had been diagnosed before marriage, I might be wrangling a four-year old into bed right now rather than writing this post.


No offense to anyone here, but if I had been properly diagnosed I might have never had to belong to this shittiest of clubs. No one wants to be here. Everyone hopes they can leave this club behind.


But I'm grateful for you guys for being here. Infertility is so isolating but you people make it less so. You helped me self-diagnose what none of my doctors could. You gave me advice about my surgery. You gave me a place to vent my frustrations and voice my hopes. Thank you for giving of yourselves to make this shittiest of clubs a little less shitty.

<p>We moved to Canada for my husband&#39;s PhD. Once again on student health insurance. I went to a walk-in clinic, hoping to get a referral to a specialist for infertility. Told them my symptoms. Same blood work. Still normal. Ultrasound: 4cm<sup>3</sup> cyst on my left ovary. Probably nothing. Undiagnosed infertility.</p>

<p>I was desperate. I looked up causes of infertility online. I found the symptoms of endometriosis:</p>

<p>Painful cramps: check</p>

<p>Painful intercourse: check</p>

<p>Painful ovulation: check</p>

<p>Painful bowel movements/urination: check</p>

<p>Blood in stool/urine: check</p>

<p>Ovarian cysts: check</p>

<p>Infertility: check</p>

<p>Armed with a self-diagnosis, I went back to the clinic, listed off my symptoms, and asked to be referred to a gynecologist. The gynecologist referred me to an RE who then referred me to a surgeon and that&#39;s how I ended up lying in that hospital bed a week and a half ago.</p>

<p>The surgeon said we have a good shot at getting pregnant without IVF now. But I&#39;m angry.</p>

<p>I&#39;m angry at the doctors who didn&#39;t take me seriously as a young woman in pain.</p>

<p>I&#39;m angry at the doctors who were too lazy or incompetent to diagnose my obvious disease.</p>

<p>I&#39;m angry that it took ten doctors and five years to finally get surgery.</p>

<p>I&#39;m angry. They stole years of my life away. If I had been diagnosed before marriage, I might be wrangling a four-year old into bed right now rather than writing this post.</p>

<p>No offense to anyone here, but if I had been properly diagnosed I might have never had to belong to this shittiest of clubs. No one wants to be here. Everyone hopes they can leave this club behind.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m grateful for you guys for being here. Infertility is so isolating but you people make it less so. You helped me self-diagnose what none of my doctors could. You gave me advice about my surgery. You gave me a place to vent my frustrations and voice my hopes. Thank you for giving of yourselves to make this shittiest of clubs a little less shitty. </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

I'm super nervous but hoping that everything goes well. Ultrasound will be on day 12 to see how my follicles are doing and hopefully we'll be able to do the HCG trigger shot! 

This weekend has definitely been a whirlwind. Found after doing the genetic carrier testing that I'm a positive carrier for cystic fibrosis. Which is absolutely terrifying. Now my husband has to be tested for it, which he went today to do the blood test. If he is a carrier then we have to cancel this cycle and IVF will be our only option. But if he's not then we continue this cycle as planned. My prolactin levels were higher than normal so she wants me to take medicine to help bring that down. When I went to get the medicine, they said that particular medicine (Dostinex) isn't available unless it's ordered so now I have to wait for that. Waiting to hear back from the RE to see if I can pick it at another pharmacy. Also my AMH came back at 14.9. Really high, I'm told. But I don't have PCOS that I'm aware of. The RE didn't seem too worried about it. Just said that we need to be careful in stimulating my ovaries to reduce the possibility of multiples. 

Lots of emotions. I went to therapy today and talked about everything that occurred and my therapist was impressed that I was still holding up. It was a rough session. I just feel like this is a lot. A lot to remember. A lot to deal with. I know others have it rough and I'm not trying to have a pity party but it just feels very overwhelming. Hoping that my husband isn't a carrier and we can just keep moving forward.

I did have a question for you ladies who did Femara, did you find it better to take it at night or in the morning?

I know a few months ago a bunch of us got that letter from Ferring re: the Bravelle recall and being reimbursed. Well, here's my update - I submitted everything to them back in January, and they said it would take 6-8 weeks to process. No big deal, fine, glad we're getting our money back at all.

A while goes by, 6-8 weeks definitely passes, and I finally called them again at the beginning of May (10th or so) like, ""Wtf guys?"" The guy on the phone was very nice, and asked for my case number (it was a long number at the bottom of the first page they had originally sent, luckily I keep copies of everything). After he got it and verified my name and address (he told me the info they had, I didn't give him my name), he said they'd received it at the beginning of May and were processing it. I verified that the paperwork I'd sent in JANUARY was only just received and being processed in May, he confirmed, and said it should be 3-4 weeks to receive our check. Nothing you can do about it, I suppose! So I thanked him and hung up.

Lo and behold, last Wednesday we FINALLY received our reimbursement check from them! Legalese about ""once you deposit this check you cannot pursue additional action against us re: the Bravelle"", typical. But we deposited the check today with no problems.

I think it might have taken a little longer for us because we also used the Greenlight reimbursement program, but when I submitted the paperwork I included the total we'd paid initially, not the total we'd paid minus the amount we'd already received back. Our check was definitely to the penny the amount we'd spent on the meds minus the Greenlight refund amount.

I thought it was going to be about women, or work, or LeanIn stuff. It wasn't. Her husband died a year ago, and she talked about Grief & Resilience.

She drew me in with an anecdote about wishing her husband could be there, when a friend said to her ""Option A is not available, so let's just kick the shit out of Option B.""

.

She talked about a model for our ability to deal with setbacks, saying it is determined by 3 P's:

*personalization*: the belief that we are at fault. Not everything that happens to us, happens because of us.

*pervasiveness*: the belief that an event will affect all aspects of your life. That there's nowhere to hide from the all consuming sadness. 

*permanence*: belief that the sadness will last forever. We project our current feelings out indefinitely. We're sad, and then we're sad that we're sad. 

.

And a few other things I could really identify with:

2. Gratitude/Resilience: Think about how much worse things could be - and use that to find gratitude. Finding gratitude and appreciation is key to resilience. People who take the time to list the things that they're grateful for are healthier and happier.

3. ""I have a reservoir of sadness, it's right here where I can touch it. I never knew I could cry so often or so much""

3. ""My hope for you is that you can find that gratitude on the hard days, when you will need it""

.

<p>.</p>

<p>She talked about a model for our ability to deal with setbacks, saying it is determined by 3 P&#39;s:</p>

<p><em>personalization</em>: the belief that we are at fault. Not everything that happens to us, happens because of us.</p>

<p><em>pervasiveness</em>: the belief that an event will affect all aspects of your life. That there&#39;s nowhere to hide from the all consuming sadness. </p>

<p><em>permanence</em>: belief that the sadness will last forever. We project our current feelings out indefinitely. We&#39;re sad, and then we&#39;re sad that we&#39;re sad. </p>

<p>.</p>

<p>And a few other things I could really identify with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Gratitude/Resilience: Think about how much worse things could be - and use that to find gratitude. Finding gratitude and appreciation is key to resilience. People who take the time to list the things that they&#39;re grateful for are healthier and happier.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I have a reservoir of sadness, it&#39;s right here where I can touch it. I never knew I could cry so often or so much&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;My hope for you is that you can find that gratitude on the hard days, when you will need it&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sheryl Sandberg&#39;s speech was about Grief &amp; Resilience, And it had a lot of good points that people in our situation might identify with. </p>

<p>Thoughts? Anybody else watch it?</p>

My husband has an appointment with an urologist that specializes in MFI soon. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on questions I should be asking.

Background: Husband has a low count and low morph that has been tested over 4 SAs. He has a small or subclinical varicocele that was found via ultrasound. He may have antisperm antibodies (SA was inconclusive?)

My RE has him on Fertilaid to try to increase his sperm count.

I plan to ask about the antibodies, how to increase his count and if there is any increased risk in prostate cancer in someone who has a varicocele and antisperm antibodies. (Dr. Google has pointed me to some studies that suggest there may be)

As previously posted, I found out Friday that my almost 12 week pregnancy was no longer viable and I will be going for a D&C tomorrow. This might sound crazy to be thinking about more IVF already, but focusing on the future is really helping me cope. The thought of a long wait before trying again is killing me.

So that said, tomorrow they will be sending tissue for testing to find out what caused the missed miscarriage and if anything else was off. Chances are it was ""just one of those things"" and there is no reason to suspect it would happen again (Please, Universe, give me that!)

From what I've seen others say online, it seems you'd need to wait for either 2 or 3 cycles before trying again to let the uterine lining build back up after a D&C. Makes sense. I don't remember a lot of what was said at the appointment but I do remember the RE said I could try again in 6 months, and when I freaked out at that, he said maybe sooner, let's just see.

So - first of all, I think I should push to do PGS, right? Honestly I'd prefer an IVF cycle that produced nothing than to go through an MC again.

And if I do PGS, it would be a freeze-all cycle (pretty sure there is no lab close enough for fresh cycle). And if that's the case, it shouldn't really matter if my lining is back yet, right?

Has anyone been through a similar thing? I'm only nervous about freeze-alls because we never had anything make it to freeze before. But I assume the 6 total embryos transfers we did do could have been potentially frozen instead. 

I'm clinging to the hope that we really do not need to wait 6 months and there is something to do before that. Any input appreciated. I posted our IVF history below. Oh, and I will be checking with a second clinic and possibly switching. Thanks!

Our IVF history:

I'll be 37 in September. No known reproductive issues, husband (39)has severe MFI. Did ICSI with testicle biopsy. frozen sample of sperm was used for IVF # 2. nothing left frozen

IVF#1 - fresh cycle, 15 retrieved, 10 fertilized, 3 transferred on day 3, nothing made it to freeze

IVF #2 - fresh cycle, 14 retrieved, 9 fertilized, 3 transferred on day  5, there was one other we hoped would go to day 6 and freeze, but no go. Singleton pregnancy/MC at 12 weeks.

**update, in case anyone else goes through this**
I had my D&C this morning. I feel fine now, just still some bleeding. I was completely knocked out for the procedure, so no pain. I bleed a ton right after in recovery, but they gave me something for that and now it's just like a very heavy period.

One thing that was very difficult. This was supposed to happen two days ago. They gave me a dose of Mistoprostol to take (vaginally and orally) the night before. I took it on Sunday and went on on Monday ready for surgery - no go. It hadn't worked enough. Same thing on Tuesday/yesterday. Finally today it happened. I did NOT know this was a possibility and Monday was difficult, because I completely thought this would be over with. The reasoning for the delays ended up being that they wanted me dilated enough so that they could remove the entire sac intact, which is much better for genetic testing. So my advice for anyone that has a missed miscarriage and has to do a D&C  - ask if there's a possibility of it getting delayed like I did. If I didn't work from home, that would have been really awkward to arrange.

Besides that, being on the drugs for 3 days caused me light bleeding and very light cramping - nothing major at all. I've had way worse periods.

Doc says he wants me to wait 2 cycles before doing any IVF again. We will talk about it next week at my checkup. I'm going to ask him why the hell he told me i'd have to wait 6 months on the day I found out - it made everything so much worse that day. At least this is better news now. After my next period, they will do karotype testing on both of us to make sure all is ok, and by then we should have the test results from today also. 
Praying that all that testing turns out ok.

Should I make a point to see my doctor to see if we should do anything differently this time? I think everything was great on paper this round, I just didn't end up pregnant. 

I've also been wondering how much monitoring other people have with IUI. My clinic does an ultrasound on CD 12 or 13, and potentially 2-3 days later if you don't trigger or get a positive OPK prior. It sounds like other clinics might do more monitoring + blood work, which I don't necessarily want, I'm just curious why. Also, it seems like progesterone is standard for a lot of other clinics, but my doctor never mentioned it. Same deal there - not sure I need it, but I'd like to understand more.

<p>I haven&#39;t seen my RE since January. I was benched for a few months, and then once I started this cycle I had monitoring with a second doctor, and a third did the IUI. Should I make a point to see my doctor to see if we should do anything differently this time? I think everything was great on paper this round, I just didn&#39;t end up pregnant. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been wondering how much monitoring other people have with IUI. My clinic does an ultrasound on CD 12 or 13, and potentially 2-3 days later if you don&#39;t trigger or get a positive OPK prior. It sounds like other clinics might do more monitoring + blood work, which I don&#39;t necessarily want, I&#39;m just curious why. Also, it seems like progesterone is standard for a lot of other clinics, but my doctor never mentioned it. Same deal there - not sure I need it, but I&#39;d like to understand more. </p>

His motility is great, volume is fine, morphology is good, but very low sperm count. He previously was told it was due to varicocele that was too pronounced to operate on, but we have now been told that is NOT an issue! - Unsure if it repaired naturally over time, or if it was misdiagnosed somehow in the past. 

However, over the course of trying to conceive in his last marriage (a period of ten years) and now with me (only for 6 months) he has never achieved conception at all.

Maybe it's my inner-hippie, but I just somehow feel like we need to exhaust our natural resources before we get stuck on medical interventions.

In part, I want to protect him from feeling like a failure or having to deal with hormone overload from recommended shots and medications and I think just taking a ""wellness"" approach for awhile could be really great.
