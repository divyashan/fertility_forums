While I haven't been shouting it from the rooftops, I've made some posts on Facebook about struggling with infertility so it's not a secret. My sister knows the most about what we have been doing as far as treatments but I've also spoken to my sister-in-law a few times about it. She's my husband's younger sister (late 20's).

My SIL and her husband have 3 daughters, the youngest of whom is about to turn 2. I was invited (via Facebook event) to a ""Tea for Two"" birthday party this weekend.  Event description is ""Moms and daughters come join us as we celebrate (niece) turning TWO!"" It will be a tea party with hats and dresses and stuff. 

The wording was so mom/daughter heavy that even my mother-in-law posted asking if she can come. (SIL's response was ""I invited you"".) 

I delight in my nieces but have been really struggling emotionally with my infertility the last couple of months. I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that we may not be able to have children. The thought of going to this event is very distressing. It feels like it's just rubbing it in my face that I am not a mom. 

My SIL in the last week included me in a group text reminder about the party, a group FB messenger reminder, and sent me a 1-on-1 text about it. I finally responded to her direct text saying I didn't think I could make it but I would send a card. 

Except... now they are predicting a big snow/ice storm in our area over the weekend and my SIL has postponed the party until next weekend.

22,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello all, I have been lurking in the infertility subreddit for some time, and I thought I would formally introduce myself if it is appropriate. I have recurrent pregnancy loss, one of which was tested to be a partial molar pregnancy. We are ending my cancer surveillance for the molar pregnancy soon, and will be starting an IVF egg retrieval with my next cycle in March with plan for PGS testing and frozen embryo transfer with my cycle in May. 

My husband and I have been trying since July 2017. I got pregnant in December 2017 and had a miscarriage in January 2018 at 7 weeks. I had been so happy when I found out I was pregnant the first time, I had so many plans and goals. Then I started bleeding. I went to the ER because my OB could not see me that day. I was in the ER by myself (my husband was at work) and I got the news and cried for so long. It was so scary and overwhelming and I felt so alone. I cried until my husband picked me up from the hospital. I was not ok, I cried at work and had to take some time off work, I was depressed and I didn’t eat, it was so hard getting out of bed to walk my dog, and I felt so bad for my dog that I could only muster short walks for him, I just felt so bad all the time. 

We stopped trying for a few months, then when we started again I got pregnant after a few months in August 2018 and had a second miscarriage in October 2018 at 10 weeks. The second was a missed miscarriage. I found out at the OB’s office with my husband by my side. I had a perfectly normal ultrasound at 8 weeks, with a good heartbeat. Then at my 10 week ultrasound, there was no heartbeat and it had stopped growing two weeks earlier, probably right after my last ultrasound. I just couldn’t understand why this kept happening to me. I was given misoprostol to induce the miscarriage and was instructed to collect the products of conception for genetic testing. It was really traumatic for me to see it and collect it. But we were able to find out from testing that the second miscarriage was a partial molar pregnancy with triploidy 69XXY. This meant I had a 5% risk of developing a gestational trophoblasic cancer from the pregnancy. I’m still undergoing HCG surveillance to make sure I dont develop cancer from this, and I cant conceive during this time for minimum 3 months. I was devastated after the first and the second one truly broke me. I was so depressed that this kept happening to me, I had a hard time just dealing with all the losses, and now compounded with a small but real cancer threat. Normal people get pregnant and have a baby, but me – I get pregnant and not only do I not have a baby, but I might actually get cancer from it. I was so broken, I couldn’t function, I was crying all the time, I felt so bad I couldn’t take my dog on long walks anymore. I took more time off of work, my boss actually walked me to the mental health office on campus because I broke down during a meeting. I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, I take antidepressants now. I left to stay with my parents for a few weeks. I didn’t feel like I would ever get over it. This has been the worst experience of my life, and I’m so scared to get pregnant again. I really want to have a baby, but I don’t know if I could go through that loss again.

My therapist has been helping me a lot. She recommended I share my experiences in group, but I was too afraid to attend the first meeting. She said that it was ok, and I could share when I felt ready. So I guess I’m sharing anonymously here with you. 

I had been seeing an RE since summer of 2018. I had all the RPL tests after the second miscarriage, which was normal except for an elevated anti beta-2-glycoprotein IgM antibody, which is one of the antiphospholipid antibodies. This was retested 3 months later and the titer normalized, so my RE said he was not concerned about antiphospholipid syndrome, but I’m still a little worried because wouldn’t I be at some risk with a transient antiphospholipid antibody? What if it goes back up with my next pregnancy? They also tested the products of conception from the second miscarriage, and it was tripoidy 69XXY, suggestive of a partial molar pregnancy. So for the molar I needed to have my HCG monitored to make sure no cancer is developing. I continuously bled for almost 2 months with the molar miscarriage, and it took exactly 12 weeks for my HCG levels to go down to the negative range. I needed every other week, and then every week blood tests until it went down. Then I need a minimum of 3 months of negative HCG before we can think about conceiving again. This cancer monitoring will be completed in April. 

To complete the rest of my workup, my husband and I both had karyotypes done which were normal. My husband’s semen analysis was normal. I had an HSG which was a terrible experience. My tubes were open, but they saw a filling defect in the uterine cavity that could be a polyp vs fibroid vs tissue from the molar pregnancy. I had such bad cramping the whole first day, I even threw up twice. The uterine cramping from the HSG was significantly worse than my misoprostol experience. I called the fertility doctor on call that night because I was afraid something was wrong. She said the cramping may have been due to the object causing the filling defect not letting the dye pass normally, so my uterus keeps contracting. She said I might be having a vasovagal reaction causing the nausea and vomiting, and if it didn’t get better the next day to call for a same day appointment. The next day was somewhat better, I would rate the cramping 60-80% of the first day. The third day it went down to maybe 20%, and I was back to normal by the 4th day. I think my HSG experience was more severe and unusual probably because they found something that requires further investigation.

So upon discussion with my RE, we decided that we will move onto IVF with PGS. He is planning on doing the egg retrieval with my cycle in March, followed by a hysteroscopy with my cycle in April to investigate this filling defect that was seen on HSG, then plan for a frozen embryo transfer in May after my HCG surveillance has ended. 

I’m still really scared of getting pregnant again and miscarrying again, but I’ve talked about it with my husband and therapist, and if I let my fear stop me from trying again, I know that I would regret it for the rest of my life. I’m really hoping that IVF with PGS will get me where I want to be with my life. I know it won’t be easy, but this whole process has been so stressful and traumatic, that I’m glad we at least have an actionable plan now with tentative dates and goals. This whole time has been so emotionally trying, and I feel so alone sometimes. I have only told my parents, two close friends, and my boss. I truly love my husband and I hope we will get through this together.  

If you have any advice for me regarding starting my first egg retrieval next month, I would greatly appreciate it. We are self-pay with no IVF insurance coverage, and I’m looking to applying for some of the compassionate care/rebate programs, but I’m worried that we won’t qualify. Does anyone have any information on income level cut-offs for these? Any recommendations on online pharmacies vs in person, or ways to get things a little cheaper? I am getting my IVF done in Los Angeles, and according to the information packet the office gave me, we are looking at anywhere between 25-30k for IVF with PGS. I’m also worried about how to plan and schedule my work around the egg retrieval. How much time did you take off before/after egg retrieval? And I’m worried about how much uncertainty regarding the date of the egg retrieval there is, since both my husband and I have to coordinate with our respective jobs to get the day off.

",t2_15daa7,False,,0,False,"Introduction: RPL & partial molar pregnancy, pursuing IVF with PGS next cycle",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_avxyz2,False,dark,1.0,,public,16,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,16,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1551427344.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello all, I have been lurking in the infertility subreddit for some time, and I thought I would formally introduce myself if it is appropriate. I have recurrent pregnancy loss, one of which was tested to be a partial molar pregnancy. We are ending my cancer surveillance for the molar pregnancy soon, and will be starting an IVF egg retrieval with my next cycle in March with plan for PGS testing and frozen embryo transfer with my cycle in May. </p>

<p>My husband and I have been trying since July 2017. I got pregnant in December 2017 and had a miscarriage in January 2018 at 7 weeks. I had been so happy when I found out I was pregnant the first time, I had so many plans and goals. Then I started bleeding. I went to the ER because my OB could not see me that day. I was in the ER by myself (my husband was at work) and I got the news and cried for so long. It was so scary and overwhelming and I felt so alone. I cried until my husband picked me up from the hospital. I was not ok, I cried at work and had to take some time off work, I was depressed and I didn’t eat, it was so hard getting out of bed to walk my dog, and I felt so bad for my dog that I could only muster short walks for him, I just felt so bad all the time. </p>

<p>We stopped trying for a few months, then when we started again I got pregnant after a few months in August 2018 and had a second miscarriage in October 2018 at 10 weeks. The second was a missed miscarriage. I found out at the OB’s office with my husband by my side. I had a perfectly normal ultrasound at 8 weeks, with a good heartbeat. Then at my 10 week ultrasound, there was no heartbeat and it had stopped growing two weeks earlier, probably right after my last ultrasound. I just couldn’t understand why this kept happening to me. I was given misoprostol to induce the miscarriage and was instructed to collect the products of conception for genetic testing. It was really traumatic for me to see it and collect it. But we were able to find out from testing that the second miscarriage was a partial molar pregnancy with triploidy 69XXY. This meant I had a 5% risk of developing a gestational trophoblasic cancer from the pregnancy. I’m still undergoing HCG surveillance to make sure I dont develop cancer from this, and I cant conceive during this time for minimum 3 months. I was devastated after the first and the second one truly broke me. I was so depressed that this kept happening to me, I had a hard time just dealing with all the losses, and now compounded with a small but real cancer threat. Normal people get pregnant and have a baby, but me – I get pregnant and not only do I not have a baby, but I might actually get cancer from it. I was so broken, I couldn’t function, I was crying all the time, I felt so bad I couldn’t take my dog on long walks anymore. I took more time off of work, my boss actually walked me to the mental health office on campus because I broke down during a meeting. I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, I take antidepressants now. I left to stay with my parents for a few weeks. I didn’t feel like I would ever get over it. This has been the worst experience of my life, and I’m so scared to get pregnant again. I really want to have a baby, but I don’t know if I could go through that loss again.</p>

<p>My therapist has been helping me a lot. She recommended I share my experiences in group, but I was too afraid to attend the first meeting. She said that it was ok, and I could share when I felt ready. So I guess I’m sharing anonymously here with you. </p>

<p>I had been seeing an RE since summer of 2018. I had all the RPL tests after the second miscarriage, which was normal except for an elevated anti beta-2-glycoprotein IgM antibody, which is one of the antiphospholipid antibodies. This was retested 3 months later and the titer normalized, so my RE said he was not concerned about antiphospholipid syndrome, but I’m still a little worried because wouldn’t I be at some risk with a transient antiphospholipid antibody? What if it goes back up with my next pregnancy? They also tested the products of conception from the second miscarriage, and it was tripoidy 69XXY, suggestive of a partial molar pregnancy. So for the molar I needed to have my HCG monitored to make sure no cancer is developing. I continuously bled for almost 2 months with the molar miscarriage, and it took exactly 12 weeks for my HCG levels to go down to the negative range. I needed every other week, and then every week blood tests until it went down. Then I need a minimum of 3 months of negative HCG before we can think about conceiving again. This cancer monitoring will be completed in April. </p>

<p>To complete the rest of my workup, my husband and I both had karyotypes done which were normal. My husband’s semen analysis was normal. I had an HSG which was a terrible experience. My tubes were open, but they saw a filling defect in the uterine cavity that could be a polyp vs fibroid vs tissue from the molar pregnancy. I had such bad cramping the whole first day, I even threw up twice. The uterine cramping from the HSG was significantly worse than my misoprostol experience. I called the fertility doctor on call that night because I was afraid something was wrong. She said the cramping may have been due to the object causing the filling defect not letting the dye pass normally, so my uterus keeps contracting. She said I might be having a vasovagal reaction causing the nausea and vomiting, and if it didn’t get better the next day to call for a same day appointment. The next day was somewhat better, I would rate the cramping 60-80% of the first day. The third day it went down to maybe 20%, and I was back to normal by the 4th day. I think my HSG experience was more severe and unusual probably because they found something that requires further investigation.</p>

<p>So upon discussion with my RE, we decided that we will move onto IVF with PGS. He is planning on doing the egg retrieval with my cycle in March, followed by a hysteroscopy with my cycle in April to investigate this filling defect that was seen on HSG, then plan for a frozen embryo transfer in May after my HCG surveillance has ended. </p>

<p>I’m still really scared of getting pregnant again and miscarrying again, but I’ve talked about it with my husband and therapist, and if I let my fear stop me from trying again, I know that I would regret it for the rest of my life. I’m really hoping that IVF with PGS will get me where I want to be with my life. I know it won’t be easy, but this whole process has been so stressful and traumatic, that I’m glad we at least have an actionable plan now with tentative dates and goals. This whole time has been so emotionally trying, and I feel so alone sometimes. I have only told my parents, two close friends, and my boss. I truly love my husband and I hope we will get through this together.  </p>

<p>If you have any advice for me regarding starting my first egg retrieval next month, I would greatly appreciate it. We are self-pay with no IVF insurance coverage, and I’m looking to applying for some of the compassionate care/rebate programs, but I’m worried that we won’t qualify. Does anyone have any information on income level cut-offs for these? Any recommendations on online pharmacies vs in person, or ways to get things a little cheaper? I am getting my IVF done in Los Angeles, and according to the information packet the office gave me, we are looking at anywhere between 25-30k for IVF with PGS. I’m also worried about how to plan and schedule my work around the egg retrieval. How much time did you take off before/after egg retrieval? And I’m worried about how much uncertainty regarding the date of the egg retrieval there is, since both my husband and I have to coordinate with our respective jobs to get the day off. When should I expect to get an accurate egg retrieval date to plan around work? Anything else I should be doing now to prepare for IVF? I’m so sorry if this was too long winded or not appropriate. It felt cathartic writing it out and sharing my experiences. Thank you for reading.</p>

We are doing IVF because prior to finding out about BRCA I had a natural chemical pregnancy and a miscarriage at 7 weeks. We then found out I'm a BRCA1 carrier (shitty timing of news). We decided to proceed with IVF and do ""embryo banking"" (like it was that easy - We were so naive) and because with PGD testing we can determine which embryos will or will not carry the BRCA gene (it's a 50% chance of passing down).

&#x200B;

Out of 2 IVF stim cycles & 13 embryos tested, we got 1 BRCA free viable embryo (passed PGS & PGD)...just one.

We transferred that perfect embryo on Valentine's Day and it failed. We are heartbroken, devastated and have no clue where to go from here. I'm still grieving hard.

We have 1 BRCA positive boy we would be willing to transfer (health risks for boys are much less), but not sure it's worth doing that now because what if it fails...what if it's a MC that will take so much longer to get going again.

&#x200B;

We will probably do another 2 stim cycles to try and get more embryos, but by the time we are done with those (another 6 months) I will be 33 and pumping my body with a shit ton of hormones. There are certain cancers that are driven by hormones and we are ultra scared this could end with me getting breast or ovarian cancer before we can even get pregnant. And once pregnant, it's harder to watch due to limitations of sonograms and MRIs. My nightmare is finally getting pregnant and then developing cancer,

&#x200B;

What do we do? Do we do an FET with the boy and hope it works?

Are there any other females on this thread that are going through IVF for their first child and are BRCA+ themselves?

Should we feel confident I still have a couple years left before I really should get the preventive surgeries (double mastectomy + ovaries out)?

We are seriously considering a surrogate, but I still struggle with it - even with that it's a gamble as if I was transferring,

Any thoughts, words of wisdom, comfort, facts are helpful as we try and understand what the best next step is. And no, I'm not ready to discuss donor eggs at this time.

As of a year ago, my AMH was 1.08. AFC was 7 at that time. Also dealing with MFI - don’t have his results handy but he’s never had more than 20 mil per mL, and more recent result I can remember was 8 mil per mL. He also has low motility. 

Past treatments include 3 cycles of letrozole with timed intercourse and one IUI with letrozole. 


Here are my results. 


Estrogen priming w/patches and 3 doses of cetrotide

Baseline - AFC 5; lining 5.1mm

Stims - 12 days of 300 gonal-f and 300 menopur

Slow response - didn’t have any over 10mm after five days of stims

4 days of cetrotide once estrogen went over 300

Trigger day - 5 measurable follicles (right - 16, 11, left - 21, 18, 21) and 2 unmeasurable follicles (5-10mm); estradiol 1,531 pg/mL; progesterone 0.44 ng/mL; lining 10.2mm

Trigger with 10,000 iu hcg

7 eggs, 4 mature, 4 fertilized by ICSI

Day 3 - two 8 cell, 1 seven cell, 1 four cell

Day 3 transfer - one 8 cell with limited frag (“textbook transfer” according to performing RE)

Day 5 - one early blast, one morula, one degenerating

Day 6 - one grade c blast, two degenerating

Freeze - nothing 

Negative beta at 14dp3dt

<p>As of a year ago, my AMH was 1.08. AFC was 7 at that time. Also dealing with MFI - don’t have his results handy but he’s never had more than 20 mil per mL, and more recent result I can remember was 8 mil per mL. He also has low motility. </p>

<p>Past treatments include 3 cycles of letrozole with timed intercourse and one IUI with letrozole. </p>

<p>Here are my results. </p>

<p>Estrogen priming w/patches and 3 doses of cetrotide</p>

<p>Baseline - AFC 5; lining 5.1mm</p>

<p>Stims - 12 days of 300 gonal-f and 300 menopur</p>

<p>Slow response - didn’t have any over 10mm after five days of stims</p>

<p>4 days of cetrotide once estrogen went over 300</p>

<p>Trigger day - 5 measurable follicles (right - 16, 11, left - 21, 18, 21) and 2 unmeasurable follicles (5-10mm); estradiol 1,531 pg/mL; progesterone 0.44 ng/mL; lining 10.2mm</p>

<p>Trigger with 10,000 iu hcg</p>

<p>7 eggs, 4 mature, 4 fertilized by ICSI</p>

<p>Day 3 - two 8 cell, 1 seven cell, 1 four cell</p>

<p>Day 3 transfer - one 8 cell with limited frag (“textbook transfer” according to performing RE)</p>

<p>Day 5 - one early blast, one morula, one degenerating</p>

<p>Day 6 - one grade c blast, two degenerating</p>

<p>Freeze - nothing </p>

<p>Negative beta at 14dp3dt</p>

<p>Let me know if any other information is useful and I can dig it up when I’m at my computer later!</p>

61,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Nearly four years ago, I saw a reproductive urologist at a clinic in Ontario. I had multiple extremely poor sperm analyses and a testicular ultrasound before seeing him. I saw him for about one minute, he looked at my bits, said ""yeah you probably have a vericocele, but you have some sperm so I'll send you to our reproductive specialist for IVF."" Apparently this clinic goes directly to IVF if the male has sperm, but not enough for IUI.

My wife and I saw the reproductive specialist at the same clinic. She explained that although my sperm is terrible (testing between under one thousand per mL to about 500 thousand peer mL, and all parameters were poor), sperm quality does not matter with ICSI. The specialist even told us a cute analogy about arriving at a party - it doesnt matter what kind of vehicle you get there in, in ferrari or a rust bucket; all that matters is that you made it to the party! In this case my sperm was the rust bucket, but I was getting to the party with ICSI. We were told the chances of conception were 40% to 50% per embryo transfer, regardless of sperm quality. 

I was not put on any medication or vitamins, and no procedures were done on me. My wife went through three egg retrievals at the clinic using various protocols with varying success. She was overstimulated once and we have had no success. We spent around $60K on treatments over three and a half years, and every scan requires a day off work and travel. After medications, ICSI, IVF, embryo transfers, and travel, we are out close to $80K, if not more. 

I since saw a different reproductive urologist because my vericocele was causing me a lot of pain. This urologist asked why I wasnt put on medications (Clomid) and why my vericocele wasnt repaired before we did IVF. His opinion is that sperm quality can be improved with vericocele repair and the basic standard of care for couples suffering infertility with vericocele is to repair it before any other treatment. He also said that damage caused by vericoceles is progressive, and they are usually repaired as soon as they are identified. I have been waiting around watching my parameters get worse for years without intervention, even though the initial reproductive urologist knew I had a vericocele. 

The clinic I had the IVF completed at verbally told me some of the sperm quality that they used for the last round of IVF that we did. I had 4000 sperm per mL, 40% motile, and the notes said that they used sperm with two heads and no tails to create embryos. We were told our chances with this sperm would be 40% to 50% per embryo transferred (we only had one embryo out of 11 eggs that time). 

Now, having looked in to this more and having talked to a different urologist, I believe we were duped for years. 

At what point does clinics providing false hope become malpractice? We were lead on and paid A LOT of money based on false chances. At what point does failing to fix a vericocele, as basic standard of care dictates, and continuing to recommend IVF become malpractice? We even kept asking along the way if there was any sense in fixing my vericocele and we were told No. 

Essentially, my wife and I were scammed out of tens of thousands of dollars over four years, while I suffered progressive pain and progressive testicular failure largely due to a vericocele. 

I am considering talking to a medical malpractice lawyer, but any thoughts or input from the forum is appreciated... 

Also of note, I was diagnosed with a brain tumour about a year ago which was initially believed to be causing my fertility issues. After seeing a neurosurgeon and endocrinologist, they believe the I have primary testicular issues (vericocele) rather than hormonal issues originating in my brain.

Hi! My name is Shaye Morrison and I am a PhD student and researcher from the Department of Communication at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I am doing a research study exploring how people tell stories about infertility and interpret messages of support. This topic is important because stories shape how we think  and talk about important personal issues. I  believe that you can provide insight into this topic. To qualify for participation, you need to be 18 years or older and be currently struggling or have previously struggled with infertility. 

I will be conducting interviews about this topic. The interview will last between 1/2 and 1 hour, depending on how much you have to say. If you are in the Columbia, Missouri area it is preferred that the interviews are face to face at a location of your choosing, but can be done over the phone if necessary or out of the area. You can choose not to answer questions and can decide to end the interview at any time. You will also be provided a copy of the questions beforehand. Would you be interested in participating? If so, please contact me at: [shayemorrison@mail.missouri.edu](mailto:shayemorrison@mail.missouri.edu).

I had posted twice about how I started ivf and then there was something on my left ovary. I've had abdominal surgeries so my fertility doc thought it was scar tissue presenting in a weird way. But the oncologist I saw said I'd need surgery and might lose the ovary and it was probably cancer and it was scary. Because I was towards the end of the ivf cycle, they retrieved 8 eggs from my right ovary, which turned into 3 embryos, which are frozen and waiting. 

Right when I made my last post, I had missed a call from the oncologist saying her plan for me had changed. That was the Friday before Christmas at 4 something. I called back within 20 minutes and everybody had already left. I didn't get to speak to anyone until the following Friday, and the nurse didn't know much other than I had to schedule another mri.

Then it turns out the oncologist wanted me to cancel the CT scan she had already scheduled. I had an appointment with her last month and she said she met with a tumor team of other oncologists and specialist radiologist who said I should definitely not have surgery and to cancel the CT scan and give another mri once all the ivf hormones were out of my body and that way they can compare mris from two different times.

Whatever it was completely disappeared. I met with my fertility doctor and she says it was probably extra fluid building up in scar tissue and getting trapped. Our plan now is to do another round of ivf and if it grows back, ignore it. She is fine going into both ovaries this time, so I should get more than enough embryos to be done (I want the possibility of two kids, if possible and if we choose that later on).

So thank you all for your support and nice thoughts and I appreciate it all. I can't even say how relieved I feel. I cried when the nurse called to tell me the results.

I have a Gonal F pen left over for my most recent cycle - 600 units and 8 needles - and it will expire on March 13. I would love for this to go to someone without insurance who needs it! I’m happy to ship. 

300 units of this pen has been used (although no contact with my skin/blood obviously) so use at your own risk.

Welcome to the Infertility Results thread and discussion! You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. 

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

(39f, ttc 2 years) We just went through a stimulation protocol (225 follistim nightly, 10 micro hcg every other night, dexamethasone nightly), but I only produced one mature egg so the retrieval was cancelled. We will still undergo IUI so as to not waste the egg, but there isn't too much hope in the success rate. Our clinic is developing another protocol for stimulation since this one did not work. Our question is whether we start again in the next cycle, 24 hours post-confirming failed IUI, or if there is any benefit/drawback to waiting a month? Is there any extra stress on your body from stim & IUI that can be mitigated with a month off, or do some of the stimulation drugs hang around in your system so it is best to continue in the month immediately after? Anyone have any experience to help us figure this out? We have a couple of timing conflicts next month so we are trying to figure out what is best, and feel like we are running out of time & options.

We have two frozen embryos remaining, 3AA and 3BB, untested and need to make a plan for another transfer in April. I am 99% sure we will transfer these both together. 

History:
31f, donor sperm (proven donor), egg retrieval at 30. 

1+ year home inseminations and 3 IUIs all with donor sperm, no pregnancies. 

Diagnosis is unexplained infertility. 

1 IVF retrieval yielded 7 embryos visual grades ranging from 4AA-3BB. No PGS. 

1 fresh and 3 frozen transfers (2 singles and one double) = 5 embryos transferred so far, resulting in 3 chemical pregnancies (only pregnancies ever.) 

RPL, clotting, immune testing etc turned up nothing. ERA was receptive using the same protocol I’ve used for all my transfers (except the fresh one.) 

My RE is really unwilling to do anything resembling an immune protocol for this next transfer. I think she would be more amenable were we to have failures with PGS embryos. She does not think the benefits outweigh the risks. I essentially have two options currently for this last transfer:

1. Modified natural transfer cycle with letrozole and trigger, with progesterone and estrogen support after transfer. I could do 5-7 days of medrol before transfer most likely with this. (I did that during one of my other FET cycles that ended with CP.) 

2. Lupron priming transfer (Lupron starting a week after ovulation) and medicated with estrogen and progesterone on the same schedule as my receptive ERA cycle (mock cycle didn’t have Lupron.) Could this potentially help if silent endo is the issue? 

3. Push back harder and get her to consider a different transfer protocol. If so, what?

A good friend of mine confided in me on a very sensitive topic last night. Her and her husband have been married for 10 years and have never been able to have children even though they have tried. I thought their marriage was great. He always seemed like a good guy and he's been with her through a lot of ups and downs (although i do know they had at least one rough patch where they almost split they got past it) She's been working a lot of hours but I thought he was supportive. Well last night I found out that things aren't that great for them. 

&#x200B;

He wants to find out the reason why they haven't been able to conceive. She scheduled an appointment because he was so insistent. She however, is very afraid to go. She is afraid to know the truth because in her words, what if she is the reason why? She doesn't feel like any good will come of this because it would be her ""fault"". Even though I told her that is definitely NOT the case, there would be no blame, it doesn't make her less of a person or damaged in any way. She said if she finds out it'll just be another thing she'll feel guilty about, and i'm afraid for her because how would he react too? If things are shaky with them now, how will they get past this?

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice on what to do?? I am so upset for her right now and don't know how to help. We talked about this for at least an hour last night until she just stopped talking. This is such a sensitive topic and I don't want to make things worse for her.

132,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone, 

After an unsuccessful first ivf cycle, we have a WTF appointment scheduled with our doctor on March 6th and want to make sure we are prepared going in. Our experience so far has been one where my fiancé and I have felt like we’ve received very little volunteered guidance from our doctor and haven’t always known the right questions to ask, and as a result have made uninformed decisions which, we wouldn’t have made knowing what we do now. I’m preparing to not let that happen again, so could use any and all advice to make sure we are not overlooking anything going into our next ER. 

Background:
Me: 30, never pregnant, healthy, none smoker, non drinker, normal BMI 

Tests: clear HsG, FSH was 5, progesterone, testosterone, AMH 3.43, e2 all come back as normal. I take 1000iu b12 IM every month for documented low levels. My thyroid has been checked several times due to family history (my mum) and because I have mild symptoms (brittle and thin hair and nails, cold) but also normal. Regular periods, but I notice i have started ovulating a lot earlier since starting IVF. 

Meds: 200mg ubiqinol, prenatal, 1000iu vitamin D, 81 mg ASA, 2000mg omega 3 per day. 

Fiancé: 50, healthy. Had a vasectomy 20+ years ago. 1 epididymus removed due to cysts, 1 testicle removes due to pain (?cancer). Had low testosterone and was on HRT until the urologist consult for the VR. Reversed that with diet and lifestyle changes, been off HRT for 2 years. 

Our first mistake was getting the vasectomy reversed. We weren’t informed what the definition of a ‘successful vasectomy reversal’ was, and had we known I don’t think we would’ve wasted time or money there. The reversal was a success for about six months. I won’t go into details unless you think necessary, but at the end of that chapter, we had 4 straws of sperm (?TESA) to use for IVF.

Ivf cycle 1- On marvelon BC for 17 days. Baseline US showed an estrogen-producing cyst, so that cycle was cancelled. Was told I could try a ‘natural start’ cycle which sounded nicer, as the Birth control was terrible for me emotionally as thought that caused the cyst. 

No one told us the pros or cons to that. 

IVF cycle 2

I believe my AFC on CD 2 was 5 or 6. Developed a dominant follicle from the beginning, which I named frank, the frankenfollicle. 

I was on an antagonist protocol. I stimmed for a total of 12 days with menopur, they added in cetrotide on the fifth day. On trigger day, I had 12 follicles measuring 34, 25, 24, 23, 23, 18, 17, 16, 16, 12, 12. My lining was 12.6 (which, looking back on the record was decreased from the previous day when it was 14.) my estradiol was around 13000 (Canadian lab values). I developed a polyp early on, so wasn’t eligible for a fresh transfer. I triggered with 10 000 units of hcg at 21:30. 

Retrieval day: retrieval was 36 hours after trigger. Dr found 3 eggs, and free fluid in my uterus leading her to believe I ovulated prior to the retrieval. She tried to aspirate the fluid out, but no further eggs found. 

Result: 3 eggs, 2 fertilized with ICSI, 2 x 5AA blasts were frozen. No pgs testing. 

FET 1: was done as a semi natural FET, with just 400mg vaginal prometrium twice a day. I had a baseline US on CD 2 to check for more polyps, was handed a pack of OPKs, and told to call when I had a positive. I called when I had a positive, started prometrium that night and had my first transfer five days later. My lining at transfer (which was the only lining check) was 9.9 and trilaminar. Assisted hatching is done with all FET. 5AA blast transferred with no issues. 

FET 1: negative beta. 

Decided to do medicated FET next. Did a mock cycle with an ERA performed- shown to be receptive.  Was also tested for endometritis. Lining was 8.8. 

FET 2: same protocol as my ERA. 2mg oral Estrace 2x a day on CD 3, increased to 4mg 2x a day after 4 days. After 10 days total, lining check showed 11.7mm trilaminar, started Prometrium immediately. 400mg vaginally, twice a day, while also continuing the Estrace. 5AA hatching blast transferred, no complications. 

FET 2 result: chemical 

Please keep in mind we are paying entirely out of pocket for this, so want to allot our resources appropriately. Apparently, we do get some kind of tax credit, but won’t find out what exactly it means for us until April. 

So here are my questions I have prepared for my doctor before going into our next retrieval:

1. Is my AMH and AFC low? I cannot remember my AMH number, but do remember at the time thinking it was on the lower end for my age. And compared to people on here, I seem to have few follicles. 

2. Would going on birth control again help with the outcome? Is it the cause of the cyst I had the first time? Would it reduce the amount of eggs retrieved?

3. How can we prevent early ovulation without compromising maturity of eggs? In the past, my doctor has hinted at doing retrieval at 34 hours, but if I’m able to do a cycle without developing a lead follicle am I still at risk for ovulating early? Don’t I risk having immature eggs if they are taken that early? I’ve read of cases where people have taken an additional dose of Cetrotide prior to ER, does this affect the maturity of the eggs gathered?

4. Is it worth doing a DNA fragmentation test on our sperm sample, and sacrificing one of our three remaining straws to do that testing? My doctor didn’t think so at our last WTF, but didn’t really say why. Given my partner’s age, and the obstruction (vasectomy), and surgical history, I know DNA fragmentation could be an issue. Would extended antioxidant use cause damage that would also show up on the fragmentation test? If we have a good test result, does that mean our chances are comparable to someone younger? Or, should we just move to donor sperm, as we already have the best sample we can get (being a TESA, taken 1.5 years ago).


I understand at this point it’s hard to say whether it’s just a combination of bad luck, few embryos and poor timing, but this next retrieval is all we can afford so I really am feeling desperate, and panicked we will end up with nothing from it. If you can think of any other tests I can request (most blood tests are covered by the province), or questions I should be asking, please let me know. I’d be especially interested in hearing from anyone else that ovulated prior to retrieval, and if you made changes for next time.

Regular periods, but I notice i have started ovulating a lot earlier since starting IVF. </p>

<p>Meds: 200mg ubiqinol, prenatal, 1000iu vitamin D, 81 mg ASA, 2000mg omega 3 per day. </p>

<p>Fiancé: 50, healthy. Had a vasectomy 20+ years ago. 1 epididymus removed due to cysts, 1 testicle removes due to pain (?cancer). Had low testosterone and was on HRT until the urologist consult for the VR. Reversed that with diet and lifestyle changes, been off HRT for 2 years. </p>

<p>Our first mistake was getting the vasectomy reversed. We weren’t informed what the definition of a ‘successful vasectomy reversal’ was, and had we known I don’t think we would’ve wasted time or money there. The reversal was a success for about six months. I won’t go into details unless you think necessary, but at the end of that chapter, we had 4 straws of sperm (?TESA) to use for IVF.</p>

<p>Ivf cycle 1- On marvelon BC for 17 days. Baseline US showed an estrogen-producing cyst, so that cycle was cancelled. Was told I could try a ‘natural start’ cycle which sounded nicer, as the Birth control was terrible for me emotionally as thought that caused the cyst. </p>

<p>No one told us the pros or cons to that. </p>

<p>IVF cycle 2</p>

<p>I believe my AFC on CD 2 was 5 or 6. Developed a dominant follicle from the beginning, which I named frank, the frankenfollicle. </p>

<p>I was on an antagonist protocol. I stimmed for a total of 12 days with menopur, they added in cetrotide on the fifth day. On trigger day, I had 12 follicles measuring 34, 25, 24, 23, 23, 18, 17, 16, 16, 12, 12. My lining was 12.6 (which, looking back on the record was decreased from the previous day when it was 14.) my estradiol was around 13000 (Canadian lab values). I developed a polyp early on, so wasn’t eligible for a fresh transfer. I triggered with 10 000 units of hcg at 21:30. </p>

<p>Retrieval day: retrieval was 36 hours after trigger. Dr found 3 eggs, and free fluid in my uterus leading her to believe I ovulated prior to the retrieval. She tried to aspirate the fluid out, but no further eggs found. </p>

<p>Result: 3 eggs, 2 fertilized with ICSI, 2 x 5AA blasts were frozen. No pgs testing. </p>

<p>FET 1: was done as a semi natural FET, with just 400mg vaginal prometrium twice a day. I had a baseline US on CD 2 to check for more polyps, was handed a pack of OPKs, and told to call when I had a positive. I called when I had a positive, started prometrium that night and had my first transfer five days later. My lining at transfer (which was the only lining check) was 9.9 and trilaminar. Assisted hatching is done with all FET. 5AA blast transferred with no issues. </p>

<p>FET 1: negative beta. </p>

<p>Decided to do medicated FET next. Did a mock cycle with an ERA performed- shown to be receptive.  Was also tested for endometritis. Lining was 8.8. </p>

<p>FET 2: same protocol as my ERA. 2mg oral Estrace 2x a day on CD 3, increased to 4mg 2x a day after 4 days. After 10 days total, lining check showed 11.7mm trilaminar, started Prometrium immediately. 400mg vaginally, twice a day, while also continuing the Estrace. 5AA hatching blast transferred, no complications. </p>

<p>FET 2 result: chemical </p>

<p>Please keep in mind we are paying entirely out of pocket for this, so want to allot our resources appropriately. Apparently, we do get some kind of tax credit, but won’t find out what exactly it means for us until April. </p>

<p>So here are my questions I have prepared for my doctor before going into our next retrieval:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is my AMH and AFC low? I cannot remember my AMH number, but do remember at the time thinking it was on the lower end for my age. And compared to people on here, I seem to have few follicles. </p></li>
<li><p>Would going on birth control again help with the outcome? Is it the cause of the cyst I had the first time? Would it reduce the amount of eggs retrieved?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we prevent early ovulation without compromising maturity of eggs? In the past, my doctor has hinted at doing retrieval at 34 hours, but if I’m able to do a cycle without developing a lead follicle am I still at risk for ovulating early? Don’t I risk having immature eggs if they are taken that early? I’ve read of cases where people have taken an additional dose of Cetrotide prior to ER, does this affect the maturity of the eggs gathered?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it worth doing a DNA fragmentation test on our sperm sample, and sacrificing one of our three remaining straws to do that testing? My doctor didn’t think so at our last WTF, but didn’t really say why. Given my partner’s age, and the obstruction (vasectomy), and surgical history, I know DNA fragmentation could be an issue. Would extended antioxidant use cause damage that would also show up on the fragmentation test? If we have a good test result, does that mean our chances are comparable to someone younger? Or, should we just move to donor sperm, as we already have the best sample we can get (being a TESA, taken 1.5 years ago).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I understand at this point it’s hard to say whether it’s just a combination of bad luck, few embryos and poor timing, but this next retrieval is all we can afford so I really am feeling desperate, and panicked we will end up with nothing from it. If you can think of any other tests I can request (most blood tests are covered by the province), or questions I should be asking, please let me know. I’d be especially interested in hearing from anyone else that ovulated prior to retrieval, and if you made changes for next time. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Just in case anyone is curious about ERA tests and whether they are worth it, I am scheduled to my ERA done this Tuesday. Just so you know my background, I am 27 years old with no infertility diagnosis. My husband and I are doing IVF due to his cancer diagnosis in April 2018. We froze sperm pre-treatment and our doctor said since the idiotic RE froze the sperm in one vial, to do IVF with ICSI. Fast forward to the egg retrieval, I got 15 eggs, 11 were matured and all fertilized and I ended up with 7 quality blastocysts. 

We did not due PGS due to our age and my doctor's recommendation, and our first transfer failed. Because of that, I was paranoid as to what the cause may have been so l have decided to do the ERA before my next transfer which is going to be in March. Hopefully all is well and I will be receptive, but I just wanted to make this post for those teetering on the idea of doing it.

143,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I had a skype consult with Dr. Sher and am just having a hard time making sense of his advice. He wants me to do an immune work up - ANA, antiphospholipid antibodies, natural killer cells, as well as HLA for both me and husband. This just doesn't make sense to me given my history.  I wanted to check in with the immune issue gurus out there. I'm willing to do the testing if it seems like it might help/make sense, I don't want to be wasteful in seeking tests that aren't indicated.

* I do IVF because I am anovulatory. My first IVF cycle was before I ever tried for pregnancy, done only for fertility preservation. Prior to that, I had always been on birth control or had an IUD. I tried for one month after that cycle, realized that I was anovulatory, and then moved into treatment. Failed two cycles of femara and then went back to IVF.
* We've done seven retrievals, mainly with the goal of banking. I think all were ICSI. Made 13 blasts, and also did a Day 3 transfer of three embryos with nothing left to freeze. PGS tested 5 blasts, with 4/5 normal.
* We've done four transfers, all resulted in pregnancy but three of the four were losses. The first was a single blast that split into identical twins, lost at 9w, normal post-loss testing. The second was a single blast that developed a severe neural tube defect, TFMR at 20w, normal post-loss testing. After that, I developed Asherman's and thin lining, eventually resolved to be > 8 mm and trilaminar. Third transfer was two PGS normal blasts, successful with a healthy singleton. Fourth was a Day 3 transfer of three embryos, two good quality and one fair. Six and seven week ultrasounds showed large yolk sac and slowish growth, miscarriage at 10w with growth last in week 8 or 9.
* We have eight blasts remaining, with 2/8 PGS tested and normal, though low grades (5BC, 5CC). The remaining six are 5AB to 3BB. Currently planning for one last retrieval and likely will transfer one or both of our PGS normals in the same cycle, freezing whatever we get from this new retrieval. We'll be doing HGH during stims and using zymot, though husband's DNA frag is good (11%, down to 3% with zymot).
* I tested ANA negative in 2013, before trying for pregnancy, and again in 2015, after my first two losses. These tests were obtained because I have Raynaud's phenomenon, not requiring medication, but I requested the ANA panel due to being a medical student and hypochondriac. In 2016, I tested weakly positive (1:40 ""not usually clinically significant""), just prior to my successful transfer. I have not been tested since. 

&#x200B;

To me, my losses do not really seem consistent with an immune issue. 

* I was told the first was likely due to an issue with placental formation during the twinning process (IVF identical twins have a 50% risk of loss). 
* The second was a neural tube defect, and I am not aware of any connection between neural tube defects and immune issues. Plus, I had risk factors for neural tube defects (1) having removal of retained tissue from my first loss the month prior to transfer - recent miscarriage is a risk factor, (2) being on metformin in early pregnancy (odds ratio of neural tube defect increases 2.5x normal), and (3) having a cold during week 5 of pregnancy, though I did not have an obvious high fever - febrile illness is associated with increased risk. I took high dose folic acid and myoinositol in my next pregnancy and didn't have recurrence of the issue.
* The third was likely aneuploid, given a large yolk sac (8 mm by 7 weeks). 

My implantation rate doesn't seem consistent with immune issues, too. 4/5 transferred blastocysts have implanted, and one of three Day three embryos implanted (of them, two were good quality and one was fair).

&#x200B;

**Conclusion** I'm not really seeing the immune component. I'm tempted to test because fuck it, why not - I'm already 100k in so what's some more testing? Plus, I have my HLA panel already, since I donated stem cells through the Bone Marrow Donor program (PSA: please register at [https://bethematch.org/](https://bethematch.org/), it's easy!).  So we'd just be testing my husband. At the same time, I probably shouldn't throw money away. I'm just having decision fatigue right now and would really appreciate some advice. What would y'all do?

This bill would require that all insurance plans in the State of California include infertility coverage, starting January 1, 2020.  The bill would require that such coverage encompass diagnostics and treatment, including surgery, IVF, and egg freezing.  The bill would also remove the ability of any insurer to refuse to provide such coverage for ""religious"" reasons.

Recently, I decided to start the egg freezing process since I do not anticipate having children in the next 3/4 years (I don't have a partner). In the initial consult, the doctor performed a follicle count by ultrasound. She only saw one follicle. I did have 2 cysts (one on each side) that she said could be obscuring the other follicles. I'm on birth control (test was performed in the last week of my packet before I start taking the placebo pills) and have been having some slight issues with my pill (not getting my period for example). The doctor has taken me off BC and wants me back to do another ultrasound and the hormone level testing in 45 days at the beginning of my next period after I finish the pack.

It's been a bit rough going from making this decision to preserve my fertility to learning that having a genetic child might not be in the cards for me. At this stage, I would just like to get a sense of what the odds are that I might get a normal follicle count (or even just higher than 1) in 45 days. Obviously I will have a better sense after I'm off BC. Not sure what the doctors plan is for the cysts, but until then I would like to be somewhat prepared and in the right frame of mind in terms of what's realistic to expect.

I appreciate anyone's advice. Many thanks

EDIT: I just want to provide an update in case someone had read this post and also to thank the posters that reassured me. I stopped BC about 3 weeks ago and did another ultrasound with another doctor. The 2 cysts had disappeared and I had a better follicule count (6).

Today at work I was unexpectedly offered a promotion to a senior position in a completely new field. The position entails a busy workload with longer hours but is well paid and is a great stepping stone to further my career. Up until now my motto has been “get as high in the company as possible until I have kids and then coast for a bit”.

I am also a little worried about the time I will need off for monitoring etc. I did tell them that I have a medical procedure next week (for the iui) and will be out of the office one afternoon but as time goes the appointments will add up.

<p>My immediate thought was “How can I handle pregnancy or any other procedures that will have to be done”?  I’m so disappointed in myself for not handling it well. I don’t know if I have a low pain tolerance or what. I just know it was probably the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life. I immediately went online and started looking for others and that’s how I found this group. </p>

<p>I’m new to the infertility community online, my husband and I have been struggling for a bit but finally decided to take the steps forward. I’m glad I found this group to read about what may happen in the future and to get support and advice. </p>

So brief history- my husband and I have been trying for 2 years. My husband had a varicocele repair the first year that successfully got his sperm analysis numbers into the normal range (morphology went from 0 to 6%). We've done all of the tests our clinic has recommended and currently we have no explanation for infertility. We haven't done a DNA fragmentation test but when we asked we were told it doesn't make sense for us since we don't have a history of repeated miscarriages or anything. We've tried several months of letrozole only and now two cycles of letrozole + IUI- no positive pregnancy tests ever. We're planning for IUI cycle number 3 (just started letrozole) and I'm wondering about how to step up our game (knowing this might be our last IUI or second to last before moving to IVF). I talked to my nurse and Dr. about trying a trigger shot and while they've said they're open to me trying it if I really want, they seem to think continuing to use the OPK strips would be best. OPKs have been reliable for me and every time we've checked, a positive OPK has corresponded with 1-2 very mature follicles and a good lining. They said they've recently changed their protocol (I think they said based on recent research?) to recommend that if someone ovulates and has consistent success with OPKs it's best to let the body ovulate naturally when its ready. I still can't help but wonder if we're somehow missing the timing and I know a trigger shot takes the guesswork out of timing. I noticed fertile cervical mucus 4 days after our IUI procedure during attempt number 1- that could've been a fluke I guess and I'm not super on top of keeping track of my CM every day or anything. But I was wondering if it's possible that even though I got a positive OPK and the ultrasound showed a very mature follicle- maybe the follicle just hung around several days longer before ovulating? My Dr. seemed to think that was unlikely. For IUI number 2- I did get fertile CM on the day of the procedure and the procedure lined up with the day my AVA wristband predicted that I ovulated (based on temps etc) so maybe we did better with the timing but it still failed.

Hi, new in this sub, but I have hung out in TrollingFAB for a few months now. Im here after a long &amp; winding road, not unlike many of you. 

10 years ago my then-boyfriend now husband was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer at age 27. Eventually he went on to have chemotherapy and a stem-cell transplant. His cancer is now suppressed due to a drug that works wonders on the cancer, but is a derivative of thalidomide. Yes THAT drug that was given to pregnant women decades ago and causes birth defects. Because of this, he banked prior to treatment, and we signed our life away by agreeing to never try procreating naturally. 

Looking at one’s future after cancer can be pretty numbing. Granting ourselves permission to have a positive outlook on the future was tough to come to terms with. We had shut the door on children, because it seemed just so impossible to handle emotionally.  Eventually we came around as we got further and further removed from the treatment. It still lurks there, but we’re in a much better place mentally. 

Our only option is IVF with ICSI because the sperm that was banked is limited in quantity and motility. 
We used IVF for our first, getting extremely lucky to have had it work on our only Day3 embryo after 2 eggs retrieved. Now we have moved on to try for #2. 

For some reason, I haven’t responded well to stimulation medications. I went through a second IVF cycle last year, only getting 3 eggs/3 fertilizations/2 Day5 blasts. A fresh ET and then a FET failed, so here we are again. 

The mantra of my RE is to go big or go home for this cycle, so I’m on a max dosage of Menopur (burn burn burn) and Puregon with Ganerelix.  So far it seems to be paying off as I have 3x as many follicles as I’ve ever had at Day 10.

I’ve pretty much resigned to the fact that this will be our last go, as I’m very eager to move on in life with or without another child. Enough of this will we/won’t we, I’m done with it. I simultaneously want to both use and get rid of all of the maternity clothes/baby clothes/baby gear taking up way too much mental capacity and physical space in my basement. 

I’m here to look for support in the hunger games that await us in the next week, and to hopefully be of use to others with questions on cancer/IVF.

I read the FAQ and it says optimism isn't a good thing because we should just ""understand her feelings and agree with her."" This is really really hard for me because my natural instinct is to focus on solutions, not wallow in misery and focus on the problems.

We're 36/m and 35/f. She has endometriosis. We're 9 months in to trying to conceive. To me, this is just the start. We know endo surgery should be helpful. We know IUI is an option. We know IVF is the last hope after that. We went to a fertility doctor recently who confirmed my sperm is fine and she has eggs, it's just somehow getting the two to meet.

To me, that's a hopeful situation. To her, she's saying the endo surgery might not do anything. That IUI is almost pointless.

I got two vials free in the mail, and have also received a refill for two more. Prior to that, I received preliminary approval to participate in the program, which provides HGH for 90 days, in increments of 30 day supplies based on whatever your prescription is. My doctor wrote for 12iu every other day during stims, so I got the equivalent of 12iu every other day for 30 days, which is two vials at a time (each 5.8 mg vial has 100iu). This is worth around $800 out of pocket. I can get more refills if need be within my 90-day pre-approval window.

Longer term approval requires proof that you don't have insurance or that your insurance REALLY won't cover it. You have to submit to the insurance company for approval, get denied, appeal the denial, and then submit the response to that to Novartis. I'm in that process now.

I'm doing HGH for my upcoming retrieval, and finding prices around $375/vial. There's some coupon available for omnitrope, but it only applies to on-label uses, which doesn't include IVF. But the coupon organization told me to call the Novartis patient assistance program. I learned today that Novartis offers FREE omnitrope to qualifying patients who are US residents, regardless of reason for use, based on household income. Thresholds below:

1 Person < $ 75,000

2 People < $100,000

3 People < $125,000

4 People < $150,000

5 People Add $25,000 for each additional person

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are a few steps:

(1) Call Novartis at 800-277-2254. They will do a 15 min pre-qualification interview. If you pre-qualify, you can get 90 days worth of free omnitrope while the official application is pending. I think it still takes a couple of weeks to get the first dose though.

(2) Fill out the Novartis application [here](https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment). Fill out the patient section yourself and fax it in to the number listed, then have your provider fill out the physician section and fax to the number listed.

(3) Have your provider send your omnitrope prescription to Novartis at the same fax as in #2.

(4) Call 877-456-6794 to talk with Omnisource. They'll ask your doctor to send a statement of medical necessity to them at 877-828-1052. It can say that you're using it for infertility, which is not an approved FDA indication - that doesn't matter. The cited it does NOT have to be one of the FDA-approved indications.

The study includes [this](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jama/934787/joi150155t2.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=pb00mDoL2ln1hbj-OuHpawYtI-4RTtsHviXbkIJ~fMXAsIBnyyAdXs6DNhtWKdqRRykiYdUemDDngi4ELuAfMYRiNTb2rqfT~EOFKHH2ya0Qz1pvHSpl16S6P0YlNhXuKlLbzkWZ4b1QoPLv2kjddquNjrSt4Xb1794bl1TZDYJ6p2X2mvzYa2mQSrd0yEljAm-e6Vwl3hJTqug9XE7B1~uxy8SmJizs8T7SnvGM39kQtObAKKayui9mGmRtEfQdBiuo5vOGRqpbzNYOPT6COd6lKYJtTEdhVD3GLrdKQYJUMDh25ks0u6GLc2A8UtTP7sU6SVaWjGhqEZP0dFRDYQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) fun table and [this](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jama/934787/joi150155t3.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=sa6RkK2OEA1rDUNXiBHhAlcbKAfDVJoXks~ohZFfCRsIjEiNkX1JW~vrM9Nq9ilUilryqiPpA5GWoEfcf-rtEwoXUOpEGrYt8~TYo6NqgJILr1T~5297ypsD5jjFibYvzkvrJE~33dXf05KoFMbceU7ZneNSBYW5R7b~B8pCj3U4OV8X9eLr1hq0K7W88Vu45mtUkzPcJ~aKarpVwmF6rnBpyB4ZNTMCQgqfkxxn14vKWIOVVK3-GDCD~DEiELH~R4Ffc3JAIuLdiTbpdOfo3c1rKc~WCfzg2kFk8U4E2uCDEAaMDx8brM8fdgE8fLB-zR~AkrTdqgQY8xi5pkAsfA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) fun table. 

I read the study and thought I'd point out some of the caveats mentioned. The first being that a good percentage of people stop IF treatments before they reach success. And for a lot of people it's early on, typically FET #3. The reason people stop often isn't because prognosis is poor (e.g. super bad egg quality or low fertilization rates); it's often because people run out of money or experience relationship difficulties. The chart therefore offers various estimates that take into consideration this problem. 

Another, perhaps less demoralizing point, is that the chart seems to suggest that if you have the embryos and keep trying, you're more likely to end up with success. 

The chart seems to suggest that after 9 embryo transfers, 86% of women have success.  

Edit: I just re-read the study and it turns out I was half-wrong. ""Cycle"" is defined as: ""a cycle defined as an episode of ovarian stimulation and all subsequent separate fresh and frozen embryo transfers."" However, 77.6% of the cycles were composed of a single fresh embryo transfer and 12.3% of the cycles had no embryos transferred.

I haven’t posted this on the dailies as it didn’t seem a simple question, but I apologise if it is in fact and should have been posted there instead.

We have attended fertility clinic where they have advised that due to MFI, we would have to go straight to ICSI. This is something we are hesitant about due to potential ethical issues (we are Christian).

The gyno briefly explained the process: eggs retrieved, fertilised, one transferred and the rest frozen. She said before the rest of the embryos are frozen, they are graded, to see which ones will not survive the freeze/thaw.

My question is are these embryos who do not score high enough (and are thus “humanely discarded”) embryos that would not have implanted anyway / resulted in miscarriage? Or are they completely viable, but just not suitable for ice?

I am thinking the only way I could possibly justify this to myself is if they would have been natural miscarriages anyway.

Just to clarify I am not judging anyone else’s choices regarding IVF, just enquiring for myself.

<p>The gyno briefly explained the process: eggs retrieved, fertilised, one transferred and the rest frozen. She said before the rest of the embryos are frozen, they are graded, to see which ones will not survive the freeze/thaw.</p>

<p>My question is are these embryos who do not score high enough (and are thus “humanely discarded”) embryos that would not have implanted anyway / resulted in miscarriage? Or are they completely viable, but just not suitable for ice?</p>

<p>I am thinking the only way I could possibly justify this to myself is if they would have been natural miscarriages anyway.</p>

<p>Just to clarify I am not judging anyone else’s choices regarding IVF, just enquiring for myself. I hope this makes sense and thanks in advance for any replies.</p>

So I'm 37f, married to my awesome best friend (m37) for 15 years, but been together since we were 20.  We spent out 20's building our lives and careers, getting out of debt, and basically learning to adult.  Early 30s we feel we got adulting under control, buy a home, grow our retirement nest egg, and are enjoying the comforts our hardwork and planning have provided us.  

I've wanted kids for a while, but my husbands on the fence, but at 36 he gets it, he's ready.  We start trying January '18.  Im down 50lbs, but looking to lose more, so Im not dissapointed when eavh month I get my period.  I view it as a chance to keep getting healthier.

Fast forward 1 year, I'm concerned we are not pregnant, and head to a fertility doctor.  Hormones are good, ovarian reserves good, normal periods, husbands sperm is good.

Next step Sono HSG....i was a bit freaked out because I was not sure if it would hurt.  Took pain meds and a Xanax to chill before the procedure.  Easy foley insert, but some gnarly cramping with the vaginal probe movements.  Uterus is normal....but....

Both tubes are blocked.  What are the fucking chances?       Happy Valentine's day....no kids without science and medical intervention for you!  I felt so sad and alone, laying there covered with only a paper sheet.  The doc told me to take my time and asked me how I was.  I told her I was processing....on one hand shocked and sad, but on the other glad to know why I couldnt get pregnant, because at least with knowledge we could hopefully move forward.

So i have a few questions.  Should i get a second opinion on my tubes?  Could the SonoHSG be wrong?  Should i get the dye HSG?  Anyone have a false blocked tube diagnosis?  

Guilt.  How do you work through the guilt of knowing you are the problem, that you are the reason your spouse doesnt have kids? 

I cry, and my husbands holds me, reassures me, but I see the hurt on his face...he is a fixer, and he can't fix this deep pain lodged in me.  He hurts because I hurt. And my anxiety is overwhelming me....the what ifs keep creeping in...what if we never get pregnant, what if he resents the life we have built if there are no children to fill it?  

I'm grieving today, hard.  I have very litte control over this situation, and that is really hard for me.  I can't fix this by myself....i cant fix my tubes. It looks like IVF is my only option if this diagnosis stands.  I hate having a lack of options.  So I'm grieving, and Im allowing it.  I get to cry, mourn my lack of choices, and come to terms with what this all means.

I'm 37 years old, husband is 34. We have been together 7 years. We live in very northern Canada. We have been TTC for 13 months/14 cycles, without any success.

Everything on my side is ok, blood tests were normal (slightly elevated prolactine but normal for my age), ovarian echo was normal, physical exam too. I'm at a healthy weight. I'm active, do not drink alcohol (I don't like the taste!) and overall in good shape/health. 

Husband had a SA. It's not good. Everything, and I mean everything, is either at the very low normal or under. His weight is a factor (he has been working on it lately) and his alcool consumption. That has been a work in progress for months. It's getting better but still not in the healthy range. 

I'm also a nationaly ranked athlete. I was planing my retirement in 2018, but not being pregnant makes it harder. I don't know what to do... Keep training and drop out if I get pregnant? Retire and risk regretting it if I'm not pregnant next competition season? I'ts one more heartbrake I have to deal with... And their is a lot of money involved. A training and show season is about 10K. 

No one knows we are TTC (per my request). My family is not the supportive kind (and my mother still thinks I'm too young... at 37 ... and doesn't believe in medical treatment for infertility). I feel lonely and isolated but still cannot bring myself to talk about it. I'm a very very private person, and this feels like a failure on my part.

<p>Everything on my side is ok, blood tests were normal (slightly elevated prolactine but normal for my age), ovarian echo was normal, physical exam too. I&#39;m at a healthy weight. I&#39;m active, do not drink alcohol (I don&#39;t like the taste!) and overall in good shape/health. </p>

<p>Husband had a SA. It&#39;s not good. Everything, and I mean everything, is either at the very low normal or under. His weight is a factor (he has been working on it lately) and his alcool consumption. That has been a work in progress for months. It&#39;s getting better but still not in the healthy range. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also a nationaly ranked athlete. I was planing my retirement in 2018, but not being pregnant makes it harder. I don&#39;t know what to do... Keep training and drop out if I get pregnant? Retire and risk regretting it if I&#39;m not pregnant next competition season? I&#39;ts one more heartbrake I have to deal with... And their is a lot of money involved. A training and show season is about 10K. </p>

<p>No one knows we are TTC (per my request). My family is not the supportive kind (and my mother still thinks I&#39;m too young... at 37 ... and doesn&#39;t believe in medical treatment for infertility). I feel lonely and isolated but still cannot bring myself to talk about it. I&#39;m a very very private person, and this feels like a failure on my part. </p>

<p>If anyone is interested in chatting, I could use a buddy. No need to talk exclusively about this.</p>

<p>So hello!</p>

\*\*\*

The wall of the examining room is painted emerald green. A bold choice, I think, for a doctor’s office. It complements the backsplash of the sink area across the room which is made up of small iridescent tiles in shades of blue, turquoise, and aquamarine.

The wall perpendicular to the emerald wall is one long window from floor to ceiling. A strange feature for a room where dozens of women a day get undressed from the waist down and probed with an ultrasound wand. But, they’ve made sure to cover it with a privacy blind that obscures the view into the room, while still letting in some natural light. In my prone position on the examining table, I can still make out, through the blind, the faint lines of clouds moving across the sky.

""Is this my story?"" I ask myself.

Every child has a story of when and how they were conceived. My mother was just 21 when I was born, and if you do the math I was conceived on or around my parents’ wedding day. I imagine the moment I was conceived as being one of tenderness and love... not one of clinical precision and discomfort, laying alone in a doctor’s office, staring at the spot where two walls meet.

Moments earlier, as I arrived in the room, before I was instructed to ""undress from the waist down,” the doctor presented me with a clipboard, and on that clipboard was a piece of paper with a vial taped to it.

8 million. That’s the number of sperm collected from my husband, thawed and washed, in that little vial. If the sperm were a city, it would be the population of London.

“Check to make sure the name of your husband is correct,” the doctor tells me.

I muster a short gasp “That’s not my husband’s name!”

The doctor looks at me, raising one eyebrow, and gives me a sly smile.

“I guess you’ve heard that one before,” I say sheepishly.

She smiles “Only about once a day.”

I confirm that is indeed my husband’s name. I lay back. Speculum in, speculum out. The catheter deploys 8 million DNA torpedoes all focused on a single target – one they have up until now completely missed - one I've been watching grow on the ultrasound screen for 14 days.

The nurse directs me to put my feet on the table with my knees in the air, sets a timer for 5 minutes, and leaves the room.

""Maybe my husband’s sperm aren’t the brightest in the world,"" I think. Or maybe my reproductive system is so confusing they get lost. Or maybe my immune system is too strong and it kills them all. Maybe my egg and the sperm meet just fine, but my egg is all like “I have a headache,” and the sperm are all like “Yeah, I’ve had a long day. Why don’t we do this tomorrow?” and they turn on Netflix instead… with NO chill.

These are the things I think about as I watch the clouds overhead. It’s amazing how long 5 minutes feels when you’re laying on your back, waiting.

At the checkout desk, the receptionist is cheery. I pay my $20 copay, and set up my next appointment for two weeks’ time. She offers me a heart-shaped chocolate.

“Happy Valentine’s Day!” she says.

I smile back. “You know… it’s my ten-year wedding anniversary today.”

“You got married on Valentine’s Day? How romantic!”

“Yeah,” I say, “It makes it doubly bad if I forget my anniversary.”

She laughs. “Well, you know… maybe it’s lucky. I don’t know if you believe in signs, but… Maybe it's a good sign.”

I nod at her, begrudgingly. I know she's trying to be nice but I don’t have the heart to tell her I don’t believe in signs.

Outside, the air is cool, but warm for February. A man in a business suit is carrying a bouquet of roses. I take a moment and look up at the facades of the buildings, and overhead, the same cloud-streaked sky I had seen while laying on my back in the examining room.

Do I dare let myself hope? Do I dare allow myself a moment to dream, and imagine, and fantasize about things that might be? How easy it would be to allow myself to curl up in it, all warm and cozy, like a thick duvet on a cold winter morning. Hope is deliciously tempting…

And dangerous, too. Hope is a beautiful yet vulnerable thing. It’s fragile and precarious. It doesn’t pay attention to rules or rationality or science. It knows what the heart wants and feeds and nourishes it with illusion. It allows you to invest in ideas which have not, and may not, ever be born. Hope believes in signs.

But can’t I just let myself? Just for a moment? Can’t I just let myself feel the anticipation and surety that hope brings? Can I just for one moment imagine the call, two weeks from now, the voice at the other end saying that word I’ve been longing to hear: “Congratulations!”

I put in my earbuds and press shuffle on my music library and the song that comes up makes my heart sink as Morrisey’s voice croons: “You just haven’t earned it yet, baby.”

My name is Anna Almendrala, and I was the host of HuffPost's infertility podcast IVFML.

I'm now working to help another podcast, called Bodies, find women who might be willing to share their ongoing infertility story with them. If you haven't heard this amazing podcast, know that the host goes DEEP and that subjects really go there when it comes to sharing the darkest, most hidden aspects of really difficult medical issues with listeners.

The producers aren't necessarily looking for someone who has already found a solution/answer to their issues. They want to find someone who has really gone down the rabbit hole and been surprised at what they've found about themselves, their health and their relationships.

They also hope that by finding someone so early in the year, they can follow them through some aspect of treatment so there can be some passage of time in the episode.

The catch: They're looking for women located in Los Angeles/SoCal only. If this sounds like you, please PM me! I'd love to email you and schedule a time to chat on the phone or meet up.

Hi everyone,

TL;DR at the bottom

Long time lurker in this sub, first time poster. First of all I would like to wish you all a lot of courage and good luck wherever you are on your journey! I hope your wish of becoming a parent may come true in whichever way is right for you and your familie. I often read posts here and I am in awe of how strong you all are (even though it’s completely okay if you’re not).

Anyway… I just need a bit of a rant after what happened at the hospital today. Sorry if it turns out long and unstructured, just need to get this off my chest. I hope that’s okay. Please delete if it's not!

I \[25f\] have Turner syndrome (I only have one X chromosome instead of 2) and as a result, 8 years ago my doctors, my parents and I all decided it would be best to remove my uterus since I was bleeding uncontrollably and I was on the verge of anemia. Because of the syndrome, my uterus was not viable anyway (except for bleeding apparently, ugh) and I didn't have ovaries so, a hysterectomy was definitely the right choice for me. This however does not mean the infertility isn’t still on my mind almost every day. Even after 8 years, I can barely remember the surgery and the moments after waking up without breaking down in tears… Knowing that I will never be pregnant, never have a baby of my own, … is just heart-breaking.

A few days ago I had a check-up with my cardiologist (Turner’s can also affect your heart, fantastic, isn't it?) and he decided I needed a CT scan with contrast fluid ‘cause he couldn’t see my aorta very well on the ultrasound. So, this morning I went in. All is good, all is well, until the nurse comes to get me to put in the IV. She grabs her check list and starts asking me all the questions she needs to ask.

* Are you pregnant?
* Could you be?
* Are you current trying for IVF?
* Are you currently breastfeeding?

She was a very sweet and young nurse. I understand completely that they have to ask/check. I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable by mentioning the hysterectomy or anything… so I just answered the questions and let it go. Even though I should have seen it coming (I’ve had scans many times before) it took me by surprise, and I’ve been feeling sad/down ever since. I wish they could just put that on my file so they wouldn’t have to ask every time…

Thanks for reading… Have a nice day!

\~ 11 .01mg/day Estradiol Transdermal Patches (Willing to Ship) 

\~ 2 Vials of PIO 10ML bottles: 1 bottle has 1/3 left and 1 bottle has 1/2 left. They expire in 2021. I just finished up using PIO 3 weeks ago. (Willing to Ship)  PENDING SHIPMENT

&#x200B;

Supplies:

I have some supplies that I have an abundance of and I'm never going to use them. I would love to send them to someone who is having to pay for literally everything.

&#x200B;

\~ 45 Alcohol swabs (willing to ship)  PENDING SHIPMENT

\~ 35 Uni-Solve Adhesive Remover Wipes (willing to ship) \[these were AMAZING for the sticky patches\] PENDING SHIPMENT

\~ 14 Syringes with 22 G x 1 1/2 needles attached to them (will NOT SHIP, I live in San Diego County)

\~ 4 18 G x 1 1/2 Needles   (will NOT SHIP, I live in San Diego County)

\~ 12 27 G x 1/2 Needles  (will NOT SHIP, I live in San Diego County)

&#x200B;

I know it is weird to get rid of needles but if it helps someone out then that is all that matters to me. I was fortunate enough that I didn't have to pay for any meds so I want to help as much as I can.

290,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"This is my first post on Reddit and I feel so alone and isolated. I’ve STC (struggled to conceive) since 2016. My life for the past 5 years has been incredibly hard. I apologize for the long post, but the timeline is important. Since 2014, the following has happened to me:

2014: Told parents my husband and I were going to TTC

2014: Month after TTC, Mom diagnosed with stage 2 cancer. Did 1 year of chemo + surgery and prognosis was good. 

2014: 3 months after mom’s cancer diagnosis, had to move 2000 miles across country while mom was in treatment 

2015: Dad died unexpectedly less than a month after my 36 birthday. Later discovered dad metastatic stage 4 cancer that he hid from me. So I never got the chance to see him since I moved to a different state. Also I did not know if my mom knew he had cancer. When his death certificate came in, I had to explain his cause of death and she cried, so I assumed she didn’t know. 

2016: I tried to move forward with life and began TTC in late summer. However my clockwork periods became highly irregular. My doctor didn’t think anything was wrong, since previous fertility testing was amazing given I was over 35.  Doctor chalked it up to stress. 

2017: Irregular periods getting worse so referred to RE. After doing repeat labs, I was diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Failure (POF). I was absolutely devastated and shocked as there was no family history or cause if this condition. 

2017: Somehow after diagnosis, I was ovulating. RE agreed to do an medicated IUI. That did not work and RE we can try again. I did not respond to the injectables meds. During my follicle check, the RE very coldly and un-compassionately said “You’ll only have a 5% chance of ever having a baby.” She just walked out of the exam room and the nurse gave me a nasty smirk. I was overwhelmed with sorrow and passed out in the exam room, half baked and spread eagle for God knows how long. 

2017: Husband and I moved back to our home state, and my mom agreed we could stay with her until we had money to buy s house. 

2017: We tried an IUI, which was unsuccessful. RE suggested IVF, and I had 3 follicles. Went through the whole IVF process and woke up from egg retrieval only to discover I had no eggs in my follicles. I was absolutely devastated. 

2018: We decided to take time off from TTC, enjoy life and try another IVF cycle in summer. 

2018: My mom was having some aches and pains that was not resolving. Doctor confirmed her cancer care back. We accompanied her to her oncology visit. Her oncologist told my husband and I that they notified my mom after my dad died in 2015 that her cancer cane back. She told the doctor she didn’t care what happened to her and did not get treatment. The oncologist also told us my mom knew my dad had cancer. So my mom lied to me about her and my dad’s cancer diagnosis!

2018: My job was unsympathetic to my situation with having to care for my mom (I’m an only child). So I had to resign. I now have to care for my mom. 

2018: I still would like to have a biological child and begin priming for another IVF cycle at a clinic that deals with DOR/POF, high FSH, etc. 

2019: Again no response to stim meds and cycle is in limbo. Also I only have 1 tiny follicle so chances of cycle working are slim. 

I apologize for the length of this post. But how could God possibly love me if all this happened to me?  Im conceived God either doesn’t exist or if He does, he hates me.

I wanted to update you all and see if any of you have any more advice or insight. My journey is continuing and I’m still very new to all the information

This is an update from my last post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9i1xkn/high_fsh_and_low_estrogen_28year_old_female/?st=JS2FIIC0&sh=90857b2b

Since my last post, I saw a fertility doctor. The doctor looked over my bloodwork. To recap, I am a 28F and my FSH was 13.4 miu/ml. The doctor decided the next route was to get my AMH tested. 

I won’t go into all the annoying details, but insurance issues delayed this process. I ended up having my obgyn write the script for me because otherwise insurance wouldn’t cover the test. My AMH came back very low at .57 ng/L and my FSH is still high at 12.4 miu/ml. During a previous sonogram, I had what looked like a collection of cysts on my ovary. She was pretty convinced I had PCOS, however, my low AMH rules that out. 

Since my last post, I have had unwanted hair growth, acne outbreaks on my back (never happened to me in my life), a random missed period and a lot of pain/blood clots when my period finally came. 

My obgyn thinks I may potentially have endometriosis (runs in the family), but wants me to go back to the fertility specialist before we consider treatment for that.

As I am sure many of you probably know, fertility doctors are so expensive. My doctor was pushing me trying to see if I’m a candidate for egg freezing.

I am sorry if any of this seems ignorant or uninformed. It is because I am very uninformed on this topic.

I am scared because I am not sure what my numbers mean. I wanted to see if any of you have advice on the next steps to take or if any of you have similar numbers as me and how you are dealing.

I have PCOS and crazy cycles.  Without medication, they typically last between 26 and 90 days.  The only constant is my bleed length: 5 days.  Hasn't changed in 15 years.

My RE currently has me taking Provera for 7 days to bring on my period, which seems to work.  Then, CD3, I start taking 7.5mg of Letrizole.  On top of that, I'm taking 1500mg Metformin daily.  God, Metformin is EVIL.  

I'm currently on CD9, which means my husband and I are supposed to start trying tomorrow.

But I still have my period.

What is this hell?! 

I called my RE end of day yesterday, when I noticed my period blood was abnormal for me.  The nurse got back to me today to ask some follow up questions and said the doctor would get back to me tomorrow.

I'm just frustrated, at the moment, that I've been on meds for months to make my body work correctly, and now, the one thing that was normal, is screwy.  And to add insult to injury, waiting 3 days for an answer as to why I'm actively bleeding is disheartening.  I get that there are more urgent matters for the RE, just...blah.

We are going to do a hysteroscopy and karyotype testing. Pending those results, we will do another FET with the remaining 2 embryos using the natural cycle but adding in PIO. We plan to take this all slowly over the next several months as my body and emotions need a break!

Hi everyone, I've been following this sub for several months under a different username (which contains my name and DOB so I never wanted to use it to post). My husband (29M) and I (29F) have a followup appointment with our RE this Wednesday following our fourth PGS normal FET fail. I've gotten so much great information from the wonderful people on this thread just by lurking. I thought it was time for me to introduce myself and tell my story and ask for any advice/things that we should be asking our RE at our appointment. I'll be as brief as possible but it's been a long journey!

November 2015: started ""trying"". 

November 2016: met with RE, did baseline tests including HSG, SHG, semen analysis. Everything came back ""normal"" with a hint of PCOS for me. I am lean but have somewhat long cycles and have always struggled with moderate acne. AFC and AMH high-ish. Did 2 rounds of letrozole... fail.

February 2017:  continue the letrozole as my body seemed to respond well to it. Added on IUI. Did this 5 times... fail. Never a hint of a positive.

December 2017: Move on to IVF. Stims and retrieval went fine. 40 eggs, 36 mature, 27 fertilized, but only 9 made it to day 5 to be PGS tested. Of the 9, we had 6 normal.

February 2018: FET 1: this was my first and only positive beta, which was low and ended in a CP

May 2018: FET 2: Fail

July 2018: ERA testing. window came back as pre-receptive by 12 hours. 

November 2018: after spending 3 months trying to get my body to cooperate (this ordeal could be a whole separate post), FET 3: Fail.

January 2019: decided to try a ""natural"" FET cycle as opposed to the other 3 which were HRT (estrogen patches and pills). So this time we did the letrozole. Everything went well... until it didn't. Another fail.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading. I am rather lost at this point as far as the next steps to take. My RE is very science-minded and doesn't like to do things that haven't been proven by literature.

I had my appointment yesterday. We are going to do a hysteroscopy and karyotype testing. Pending those results, we will do another FET with the remaining 2 embryos using the natural cycle but adding in PIO. We plan to take this all slowly over the next several months as my body and emotions need a break!</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I&#39;ve been following this sub for several months under a different username (which contains my name and DOB so I never wanted to use it to post). My husband (29M) and I (29F) have a followup appointment with our RE this Wednesday following our fourth PGS normal FET fail. I&#39;ve gotten so much great information from the wonderful people on this thread just by lurking. I thought it was time for me to introduce myself and tell my story and ask for any advice/things that we should be asking our RE at our appointment. I&#39;ll be as brief as possible but it&#39;s been a long journey!</p>

<p>November 2015: started &quot;trying&quot;. </p>

<p>November 2016: met with RE, did baseline tests including HSG, SHG, semen analysis. Everything came back &quot;normal&quot; with a hint of PCOS for me. I am lean but have somewhat long cycles and have always struggled with moderate acne. AFC and AMH high-ish. Did 2 rounds of letrozole... fail.</p>

<p>February 2017:  continue the letrozole as my body seemed to respond well to it. Added on IUI. Did this 5 times... fail. Never a hint of a positive.</p>

<p>December 2017: Move on to IVF. Stims and retrieval went fine. 40 eggs, 36 mature, 27 fertilized, but only 9 made it to day 5 to be PGS tested. Of the 9, we had 6 normal.</p>

<p>February 2018: FET 1: this was my first and only positive beta, which was low and ended in a CP</p>

<p>May 2018: FET 2: Fail</p>

<p>July 2018: ERA testing. window came back as pre-receptive by 12 hours. </p>

<p>November 2018: after spending 3 months trying to get my body to cooperate (this ordeal could be a whole separate post), FET 3: Fail.</p>

<p>January 2019: decided to try a &quot;natural&quot; FET cycle as opposed to the other 3 which were HRT (estrogen patches and pills). So this time we did the letrozole. Everything went well... until it didn&#39;t. Another fail.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve made it this far, thanks for reading. I am rather lost at this point as far as the next steps to take. My RE is very science-minded and doesn&#39;t like to do things that haven&#39;t been proven by literature. I appreciate this about her, but I feel like at this point we need to take a step back and realize that we are not a &quot;textbook&quot; case and perhaps we need to think outside the box. I am hesitant to suggest anything as I am afraid she will shut it down as being unscientific. So, I am looking for any advice on things we should be considering at this point. Thanks in advance!</p>

Hi All! New to the sub and in need of advice!

Some background on me. I’m a 30F, recently married, and a doctor my first year out of medical school. My husband and I were married in May and immediately began trying to conceive. I had been on oral contraceptive pills from age 15 until 4 months prior to my wedding, so I was surprised when my periods became irregular. In October I had a chemical pregnancy and I got fed up in January and went to an REI specialist. 

Well, after an extensive workup she diagnosed me with PCOS. I’m completely stunned, as my BMI is 20.8 and I have no hyperandrogenism either clinically or on labs. I meet Rotterdam Criteria based off my irregular cycles and having  80 visible follicles on ultrasound. I do not represent the “typical” picture of PCOS and that coupled with my use of birth control pills contributed to my being diagnosed relatively later in life.

My REI offered me either ovulation induction with Femara + IUI (roughly $2k) or we can go straight to IVF (roughly $16k including medications). The cost difference here is huge, but my husband is enthusiastic about IVF due to its relatively high success rate (75% vs 30-40% for ovulation induction with IUI) and the fact that my ovaries will be frozen at age 30 so I’ll have younger eggs for subsequent attempts to conceive. My friend in OBGYN thinks we will be successful with ovulation induction due to my rather atypical presentation of PCOS and the fact that I’m relatively healthy otherwise. But my husband also has a point. 

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else out there is going through the same thing and what your experiences are? Any opinions on the matter or other considerations I’m not thinking of? I thought as a doctor I’d be better at making this decision but either way feels like a dice roll.  

Also, I read the sub rules and tried to follow all of them, but apologies if this violates the rules here or offends anyone!

Edited to add: Husband's semen analysis came back, and it's a little hard to interpret. Literally everything is sky-high, as in ideal sperm donor level, except his normal morphology level is 4%, which is borderline. I saw an incredible post on this sub by u/chulzle explaining semen analysis interpretation, and in the context of all the rest of the results looking great, we could be OK. Need to discuss with the RE, I guess, on what this could mean, but it looks like maybe IUI will be necessary at the very least. 

Also, my HSG did show normal tube patency but there is an opacity on the left uterine fundus concerning for endometrial polyp.
