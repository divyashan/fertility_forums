My first post...so here goes...

We did a few tests at the start of last year as we had been ttc for two years so knew something wasnt right. Turns out his sperm count is normal but there is 0% motility. This was retested with same result. At this time the doctor mentioned ivf would be necessary.

We had our first consultation with the fertility clinic at the start of this month. Had been putting it off for some time until we had the money together for a few cycles..so theres not too much pressure on the first one.

We know we will more than likely need ivf with icsi..which we will get to discuss more in our next appointment in 4 weeks.

Just wondering if anyone knows what can be done with 0% motility...anyone else have the same issue?

I've been reading a lot here tonight and am really starting to lose my shit a little bit. I'm 38 (39 next month) and my husband is almost 40. We have been trying for about 3 years, and finally have a first appointment for a consult next Tuesday. (I know, we should have done this a long time ago, but there are a variety of reasons why we haven't that I just don't want to go into. We are where we are now, right? I've posted an intro on r/stilltrying and r/ttc30, if you'd like to know more about me.)

We are going to Kaiser Permanente, but just because that's who our insurance is with. Really we could go anywhere because our plan with Kaiser covers ZERO infertility-related costs. We'll being paying entirely out of pocket for anything and everything.
But are we going to need to go straight to IVF?? Should I bypass Kaiser, who doesn't even have REs (just an OB/GYN department, at least in my area), and go right to a reputable fertility specialist?
We're in Oregon and from the little looking around I've done tonight, I've found that OHSU (Oregon Health and Sciences University) has an infertility department (http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/women/services/fertility/). About IVF, they say, ""We consistently rank in the top 10 percent of ART pregnancy success rates nationwide.""

Should I keep our appointment for next week, since we're already scheduled, and get the initial testing started, then go from there? Kaiser doesn't do anything above IUI, and they told me over the phone when I made my appointment that I would have to go out of their system to go beyond that. They were also upfront about my options to go elsewhere, as we'll be paying entirely out of pocket, no matter where we go.

I know I need to take a deep breath here. We don't even know what is wrong, who with, etc. But I am scared that we're too late, at least to conceive without spending thousands and thousands that we don't have. What does IVF cost anyway? Oh god. Breathe, breathe, breathe.

Thanks for listening and for any advice you may have.

EDIT: I submitted this last night, but it's not showing up anywhere, so I'm trying again.  I'm doing a little better today, but I keep thinking of the shell of my eggs thickening and becoming impenetrable as I get older each day.  Shudder...  The irony is I've been pretty relaxed for much of this journey.  Maybe that's been the problem.  

EDIT 2:  Wow, thank you all so much for such great information.  I feel much more balanced than I did when writing this, and better armed with where to start.  I called OHSU today and got just a little info (about a month to get a first consult appointment, $110 for SA vs. $75 at Kaiser).  Their financial counselor was out, but I left a message and should be hearing back on Monday to find out more procedural info and pricing.  As of now, (especially given the relative SA cost, which I'm thinking could apply to other initial tests as well, so it might be in my financial interests to start there), I'm keeping the Kaiser appointment, but am thinking that on Monday I will very likely end up making an appointment at OHSU.  I will spend part of the weekend researching these various tests and options. Again, thank you all so much!  ",t2_m5m9p,False,,0,False,"Freaking out and looking for advice... RE vs. OB?

<p>We are going to Kaiser Permanente, but just because that&#39;s who our insurance is with. Really we could go anywhere because our plan with Kaiser covers ZERO infertility-related costs. We&#39;ll being paying entirely out of pocket for anything and everything.
But are we going to need to go straight to IVF?? Should I bypass Kaiser, who doesn&#39;t even have REs (just an OB/GYN department, at least in my area), and go right to a reputable fertility specialist?
We&#39;re in Oregon and from the little looking around I&#39;ve done tonight, I&#39;ve found that OHSU (Oregon Health and Sciences University) has an infertility department (<a href=""http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/women/services/fertility/"">http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/women/services/fertility/</a>). About IVF, they say, &quot;We consistently rank in the top 10 percent of ART pregnancy success rates nationwide.&quot;</p>

No offense, you all are great people, but I know you all understand not wanting to be here.  That said, it has been such a comfort coming here and finding people who actually understand the whole range of emotions and experiences.  I just thought I'd introduce myself.

I'm 30, husband is 35. We've been trying a little over a year, and just about a year ago I was diagnosed with PCOS.  Did an HSG and husband did a sperm analysis, both fine.  In September I started taking clomid, and when the first cycle didn't make me ovulate, I was referred to an RE while doing a second round of clomid.

We met with the RE in December.  He did some more blood work, which was all pretty normal except for high AMH.  He started me on letrozole, which has been making me ovulate, and we've been doing timed intercourse.  For the second and third cycles, I also did an ovidrel trigger shot.

This cycle, we'll be moving on to IUI, which will likely be on April 1.   I'm trying to be positive that it should give us a better shot, but I just really didn't want to get to this point at all.

Our doc is very reputable in our area. Two of my wife's friends have been patients of his. One friend had two children via IVF with this doc.

After all our testing and monitoring, the doc said we have age working against us (my wife is 38) and Endometriosis. All her levels came back good and I'm good. She had two small polyps in her uterus removed. At this point, there was nothing else he could say that was wrong. 

We tried most of 2014 and had one chemical and one miscarriage. I say most because we missed a few months when I was sick, she was traveling, confusion around ovulation, recovering from miscarriage.

Our doc of course wants the best chance for an positive outcome and is known to be aggressive. Assuming that's why he says go straight to IVF. The IVF nurses are a little more open and tell us the choice is ours and there's nothing wrong with trying the other options.

I care more about my wife's well being and health than a positive outcome. I also don't want to put her through IVF if it isn't necessary. We are both trying to balance outcome with risk.

My wife is kind of freaking out about the Endometriosis and thinks IVF is our only option.

For some reason I feel like we should try either 1. monitored Clomid with intercourse or 2. injectable medication with IUI, before we go to IVF. 

But I'm nervous about if we did either 1 or 2 for a few months, are we setting ourselves back with time (due to age) if things don't work out which would add more stress to the situation.

Can anyone offer any advice or comments? How did you choose the course of treatment you are following?

Just a quick background, I've been diagnosed with Non - Obstructive Azoospermia. My male factor infertility urolgist says that he can attempt a mTese procedure BEFORE having my wife go through and IVF cycle and if anything is found, freeze the sperm.

The IVF clinic and doctor we are working with is very much against using frozen sperm for the ICSI / IVF.

The advantage is obviously not having to put my wife through the IVF process if my procedure is a failure.

Our worries are that if they freeze the sperm and it doesn't thaw, we just went through all of it for nothing, and there might not be a guarantee that they can find sperm again.

Any opinions on what we should do? Should we just take the chance and do my procedure first? The urologist gives us a 60->70% chance of finding something.

I was completely floored.

I've been through one cycle of ICSI already, through the NHS here in the UK.  Due to my age (now 41) I have exhausted my free treatment options and have been looking at private treatment centres...  when i happened to see information of 2 things that I wondered if anyone else had tried or looked into...  They both cost an extra amount so I was curious about what people here might think...

The first, which in the scheme of things doesn't cost very much, is 'laser assisted hatching' where they make a small break in the outer layer of the embryo using a laser - it doesn't harm the cells of the embryo - before transfer.  The idea is that the break in the outer layer assists the implantation of the embryo.

It's really only supposed to be useful for people that: have had 2 or more failed cycles, or; are over 37, or; undergoing frozen embryo transfer or had thickened lining to the embryo....

The second, Eeva - Early Embryo Viability Assessment, looks at the specific timing of when cells divide to determine the ultimate quality of the embryo.  So rather than the embryologist simply taking the embryos out of the incubator each morning, looking at them to see if they have reached certain milestones in their development and grading the embryos based on what they look like, with Eeva the embryos never leave the controlled environment of the incubator, and a computer uses time-lapse image analysis of every embryo to non-invasively and safely analyse embryo development and in particular the timings of the cell divisions.  They reckon the specific timing of the cells splitting is important in assessing quality....

Thanks so much for your advice. I feel very hopeful that we now have another option. Now if I can find a way to afford two rounds of ivf then there&#39;s a good shot I can have a kid.... just with no more savings. :o(</p>

I hope this is an okay place to post this, and I apologize in advance if it isn't. 

I'm 34. For the past two summers, I've had some issues with hot flashes. I saw my doctor each time it started, and she wasn't worried. I'm a bike racer, which means I train 15 hours a week or so, and my doctor felt pretty certain the hot flashes were my metabolism going crazy as a result of the warmer temperatures and an increased training intensity. She did some blood tests each time, but evidently didn't test FSH. This year, the hot flashes started early. I went to see my doc last week, and she was more concerned this time. She ordered blood tests, including FSH. Last night, the test results showed up in my online chart, and my FSH value was off the charts. 

The scale included with the lab results listed 1.5 - 33.4 as the normal range. My result was 143.9. My doctor sent me a message saying she wants to speak with me about the results, but I'm not able to see her until Thursday, and I'm freaking out a bit. I know it's a terrible idea, but I googled high FSH, and now the internet has told me I am not going to be able to have kids. 

My partner and I just had an offer accepted on a house. The plan was to start trying after we move in. Of course, I'll be discussing all of this with my doctor in a few days, but I was wondering if anyone here has any advice on good sources of information for women in my situation, or just any words of encouragement.

So, I'm triggering tonight for my first IVF. My clinic has an online portal that lets me see all my results. SO I've been watching along the way as my follicle count and size has increased. Today, stim day 12, I went in and got told everything looked great and I would trigger tonight.

This afternoon when the portal was updated I noticed that the follicle count has dropped! Yesterday I had 16 listed on my left side, and 11 on my right. Today, it lists 12 on my left, and 7 on my right.

Has anyone had this before? I haven't ovulated have I? I'm assuming it could be due to the fact that they're larger and maybe harder to see, or maybe they only counted a sampling?

I have emailed my clinic to ask, but thought I'd go to you guys to calm me down ;)

I had a question about progesterone suppositories. I've been taking prometrium 200mg twice a day, starting at 3DPO to lengthen my luteal phase. My average luteal phase is about 9 day, however the progesterone has lengthened it to 16-19 day (yay).

I'm currently on my 3rd cycle of using the suppositories, and I have a question for all you wonderful ladies who have taken these god-awful things. It seems like although my period is held off for several days past my normal 9 day luteal phase, my cycle seems to keep its original 28 day loop. 

For example: I normally ovulate later in my cycle, like between days 15 - 19. While on progesterone, it's been day 11 and 12.

Additionally, when my fertility tracking app indicates when I would usually start my period (but don't b/c of the progesterone), I notice that my cervix is really high like I'm having my actual period but nothing is coming out. It then goes back to really low after a couple days. I also experience period like pulling cramps, like I have a tampon in when my cervix is high.

152,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Alright...I should introduce myself (kindof). I appologize if this is REALLY long winded...

 I REALLY hate doctors. I turned 30 in December, husband is 28, we have a beautiful 8 year old daughter together. 6 and a half years ago we started trying to have another baby. We got pregnant by surprise the first time, I figured things would be easy the second go round. I was very very wrong...

First off, When pregnant with our daughter, my doctors told me I was high risk, but never explained why. I didnt have bad morning sickness, but ended up with a few colds, a UTI, and suffered through Mono, resulting in losing 15-25 lbs during my pregnancy. Despite all that, I felt fantastic, carried my little girl to term, she was born with no complications after short labor. I could ever figure out why everyone was so scared I was going to lose the baby.

Back to trying for baby number two: I first noticed the issues when I began having irregular bleeding. I didnt think much of it at first, because I was so pumped to not have bad cramps anymore, like they were pre-baby. (At one point I puked and passed out in the bathroom at high school because I was in so much pain) I eventually went to see a doctor, who said there wasnothing physically wrong, but offered a hysteroscopy or a hystorectomy to solve my irregular bleeding. I was terrified, and convinced myself I didnt need a doctors help, and never went back. 

3 years later, after too many rounds of playing ""Am I pregnant or not?"" with my emotions and a miscarriage in April, I finally booked an appointment with an OB-GYN to find out why I wasnt getting pregnant. Again, before examining me, he announced that it was one of three things: I was too fat, I had PCOS, or it was my husbands fault. My world was shaken, but I was determined to have another child, so when he instructed me to go home and look up what PCOS was, I did. I started exercising more, changed my diet, and began looking into natural remedies for PCOS while doing tests for this doctor. My husband went and got himself tested as well. After my results were in, I was informed I in fact did NOT have PCOS, and the doctor asked me why I was surprised... He informed me I had ""Unexplained Infertility"". I should have walked away then and there. He booked me for an HSG in a town 2 and a half hours away, explaining he couldnt do the test in the city. He again instructed me to go home and look up what an HSG was, and I would see him at this hospital for the procedure. November 27, 2012, I had the HSG done by a doctor I had never met before, and afterward was pulled into a tiny change room where my OB GYN told me that most women get pregnant after this procedure within three months, and that again, there was nothing physically wrong with me so he didnt know why I couldnt gt pregnant. Well, I didnt get my period for 4 months. I never went back to that doctor.

I found myself a different doctor who was great, but he was just a GP, and fertility stuff made him uncomfortable, but he was willing to check my hormone levels and thyroid, and refer me to a fertility clinic. I was grateful, and he did discover I was suffering from severe anemia. Finally, a possible answer! Unfortunately it took a year and 3 months to get into the clinic. 

Which brings me to now, and the reason I have so much hate for doctors. I adore my fertility specialist, despite what she has put me through. I have had a second HSG, an Endo Biopsy, an AFC count, a million blood tests, and I am now scheduled for an SIS. It took six and a half years, and I dont know how many doctors to find out that I not only have a tilted uterus, but also a Partial Bicorunate (Heart Shaped) uterus. This is one of the PRIMARY reasons why I havent been able to get pregnant (waiting back on yet another PCOS test). The malformation of my uterus is why doctors were so worried about me losing the baby the first time. Why on earth wold a doctor NOT inform me of these things?? Ive been tormenting myself for years thinking I had done something wrong, suffering through rage and bitterness at pregnant women, feeling guilty for wanting more than one child when I have frends who cant even have one baby, only to find out that its mostly because my uterus didnt form correctly.

I later had some pretty major OHSS and high estrogen, so it was a good call. We had 22 eggs, 21 mature and 21 fertilized. Only two made it to freeze.

Last month, after multiple days of lots of menopur with femara, we could not get my ovaries to do a damn thing.  So we quit, used oral progesterone to make sure my cycle didn't go on forever.  I was told I could be spared a baseline, because I was extremely unlikely to develop a cyst, so when CD1 came around I got my meds filled for the next cycle (7.5 femara, 375 menopur) and since I was traveling, got scheduled for my first monitoring.  

On first monitoring, we had a 12mm follicle and a 21mm something, which seemed suspicious and quite likely a cyst after all, as my lining was still thin though not as thin as 2 cycles ago.  We quit the femara early, continued the menopur.  Friday's ultrasound and the supposed cyst was GONE....  and the 12 shrunk to 10.  She sent me to the lab immediately, said to do the menopur last night but the results should be back in the morning, if more than 1, I likely ovulated Thursday night/Friday morning.  It came back, 2.6.  Thank god for the testing, no wasted meds, and I wasn't temping (thermometer toast), and 2-3 days to notice the difference would be too late anyway.  But I just ovulated on CD8-9.  Let's just call it 9.  It's still NUTS.

Friday I woke up at 4:40am and was wide awake (sound familiar?)  After harumphing silently a few times, I discovered the SO was also awake, and we decided to use that time for the horizontal tango since neither of us had any hope of getting back to sleep.

My SO and I are experiencing secondary infertility. We have 2 children, but we have been trying for 6 years to get pregnant again. 

I've had PCOS since I was a teenager (I only have 4 cycles a year since... well, forever). That's it - 4 ovulations a year. I also found out after my last child (a rough pregnancy) that I have a retroverted uterus. 

After many years of trying with NOTHING happening, we actually started some new meds and got preg within a month (woohoo!) 

And then we had a very traumatic miscarriage - the doctors thought I had a molar pregnancy and I had to wait 3 weeks until the test results came back negative (check out molar pregnancies on google, if you dare). Basically, I spent three weeks preparing myself for the possibility of needing chemotherapy before learning that everything was okay, on top of dealing with losing the baby. (aka - the three weeks of hell.)

BUT -that happened about 6 months ago, and I've finally been feeling like I'm in a better place. I've been having some uterus pain that was abnormal, though, so I went into the docs - they did a CT scan to make sure everything was ok. 

Everything was ""fine"" (the pain was an overly large cyst that took care of itself a few days later) - but they did discover one more thing stacked up against me: I have a bicornuate uterus. This might explain why my last child was born preterm. 

So - PCOS, retroverted uterus, and a bicornuate uterus. 

I keep flying back and forth between throwing my hands in the air and giving up on having another child completely, sobbing like a baby in a corner somewhere, and trying to psych myself up for another round of trying.

Many labs give a 40% (or so) discount for uninsured people, but if they have your insurance on file the lab won't give you the discount even if you say not to go through insurance.  I have a specific lab I go to that doesn't have my insurance on file and I say I don't have insurance to get the discount.  

You can also use online companies like healthonelabs.com and order your own blood work.  A progesterone test is $40.  I used them to order my own complete thyroid panel and it is very easy and straight forward.  The downside to the online companies is that it takes an extra day or so to get the results- so if you need the results ASAP, it's not a good option.  If I have to do another cycle, I'm going to talk to my RE about getting my progesterone tested using that service.  It's $90 at my RE, it'll be about $60 at the lab not using insurance, and $40 through healthonelabs.com.  They have all sorts of fertility tests, including estrodiol, FSH, and more and at lower rates.  Your results are emailed to you so it'd be easy to forward them to your doctor.  

EDIT:  A couple things about this that I failed to mention.  First, calling your insurance company to find out if your tests will be covered is a good idea.  You will need the procedure codes and diagnosis code.  Second, this only works if the lab/hospital doesn't already have your insurance on file.

I'm 30 my husband is 32 and we have been actively trying to have a baby for the past 16 months.  We have nothing wrong with us according to fertility work ups and tests that have been done so we are in the ""unexplained infertility"" group.  We got pregnant on our own in October after my HSG and lost the baby at 5 weeks.  I got pregnant again in January via IUI and had another CP shortly thereafter.  

We started Clomid and IUIs in December and are now on our 4th and final medicated IUI cycle.  I was on the minimum dose of Clomid since I ovulate normally, but I only ever had 1 follicle from that each time. For this last cycle they are doubling my clomid to 100mg and putting me on Pogesterone suppositories to hopefully give us our best shot at getting pregnant and not losing it.  Our fingers are crossed for this cycle, but I feel like I need to prepare myself for what lies beyond this cycle.  We have a consultation scheduled with our RE on March 16th to discuss what we are going to do following this cycle if it doesn't work out and I want to prepare myself for what IVF entails.

So... for the advice part of this post... For those of you who have done IVF, what's the protocol?  Injection medication?  How long do I do that?  What sort of side effects come with that?  Will the meds affect my daily life?  What's up with retrieval?  Did ya'll opt for genetic testing?  How are all of these procedures?  I mean I'm fairly used to the ""dildo-wand"" ultrasounds and the IUIs don't really bother me too much, but I feel like retrieval sounds like a much crazier and invasive maneuver.  So yeah... any advice or stories would be most helpful to this IVF noob.
