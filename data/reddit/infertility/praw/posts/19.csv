I have an egg retrieval tomorrow for IVF and my husband has a testicular biopsy. Trigger shot was last night. They told us after midnight tonight to not eat or drink.

Also, they say it will be done under ""mild sedation"". I wish I had asked more - my RE had a family emergency and is out for a week so I met the new doc yesterday and forgot to ask a bunch of stuff. Does mild sedation mean I'll technically be awake but won't remember?

I've never posted my full story here, I'm mostly a lurker in this sub. My husband & I got married when we were 23 (me) and 27 (him) about 14 years ago. We started trying in that first year, so this has been going on for a long time. 

After about a year with zero results, I went to my GYN to see if she could help. I was young, very regular and the only thing she noticed that was a possible problem was bad cramps. She said it could be endometriosis, but the only way to know was with laparoscopy. I was clueless and wanted an answer, so I did the surgery. She found nothing, but said there could be ""microscopic endometriosis"" and I could try lupron to shrink it. Still clueless and desperate, I took the lupron shots. That put me out-of-commission for babymaking until the next year, when my cycle resumed, complete with the exact same cramps as before. The lupron had done nothing. My GYN sent me on to a RE.

We started with the RE when I was about 26 or 27. Did the full blood panel, checked FSH and all that jazz. Everything normal. Husband's SA was not great, but not terrible. We tried a clomid cycle, then 3 IUI's with no luck. Over this time, I had developed a new, strange symptom and I attempted to describe it; from day 22 to day 27 of my cycle, I had sharp, stabbing pains in my uterus, then one day of nothing, then my period would start. This happened **Every Single Month**. Also during that time I had a bad case of ""frequent urge to pee."" At first it was waved away and dismissed. After all the failure and the diagnosis of Unexplained Infertility, RE decided that perhaps it was endometriosis and he should get in there and clear it away. I mentioned that we'd tried that before and nothing was found, but he couldn't think of anything else it could be (this blows my mind in retrospect) and once again, I agreed to do a laparoscopy. 

As expected, laparoscopy number 2 found no endometriosis, just one little cyst on my left ovary, which is pretty normal and usually dissolves on its own, but he carefully removed it. RE said our only option was IVF, because that's what's done with UI. We left, feeling deflated. IVF is very expensive and our insurance wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot-pole.

A few years later, we were doing better with money and managed to save up a good chunk. We tried IVF. They took 25 eggs from me, 19 fertilized, one transferred (I wanted 2, Doc was certain it would happen with our high-quality embryos). 9 were fit for freezing.  IVF was a complete failure. The stabbing pains were still there, after the transfer.

We went right in to a FET after that, choosing to transfer 3. One didn't survive the thaw, so we were left with 5 in the freezer. Another complete failure. Still the sharp pains and frequent urination in the 4th wk of every cycle, which I brought up many times.

Again, we felt lost. Nothing was working and no one knew why. We went back to our lives, still trying the ""natural"" way every month. I ovulated like clockwork. My husband cleaned up his diet, quit smoking, gave up alcohol except for special occasions. We bought a house, changed jobs, saved more money. Somewhere in there, we visited a couple other doctors, to get second and third opinions. They were also completely befuddled.

Finally ready to try another transfer, we returned to the original RE. Somewhere along the line, it apparently became SOP to do a saline ultrasound before a transfer. It sounded terrible to me, but I agreed. Do what ya gotta do, right? I started BC pills for my transfer and scheduled the saline thing for a week later. 

Immediately after the saline went in, there it was. My fibroid. My angry little demon that gave me stabbing uterus pains every time my estrogen and progesterone rose in the fourth week of my cycle. Why had no one ever seen it when it was all fat and healthy before? I don't know for sure. They had opportunities, during the surgeries and transfers. Maybe it was smaller then.
It could be because almost every ultrasound I'd ever endured was early in the cycle, to count my follicles, or see how they were growing *before* ovulation. No matter how many times I brought up the late cycle pain, no one ever wanted to look at things late in my cycle. The birth control pills for the transfer had caused the familiar pains (and likely growth) long before I would ordinarily feel it.

When it was first discovered, I was upset, then angry, then just sad. It seemed something had been standing in our way at every turn, and this was just another thing. RE said it could only be taken care of with (*another*) surgery, and our transfer will have to be postponed for another 6 months. It is sitting in exactly the part of my uterus where an embryo would likely nestle in, if the fibroid weren't there.

Now, I've thought about it, and I'm hopeful. Maybe it's the thing that's been our problem for years and years and years.

**TL;DR**: I have a big ol' fibroid in my uterus that's gone completely undetected, despite years of fertility treatments, ultrasounds and complaints of symptoms that fit with fibroids.

I just completed my first IVF. If I can please share my beta hcg for context: 2/5: 55, 2/8: 102, 2/10: 123, 2/12: 165, 2/17: 677, 2/19: 1402.  On the 5th they called and said ""congrats, it was successful."" On the 8th they stated that they really wanted that number to be 115, so we are looking at a possible early loss. And then with the results on the 10th they confirmed its a loss, but said lets check the number again to make sure it goes down. 

When it went up to 677 the FE was concerned that its ectopic and did the ultrasound to look for evidence....which there was nothing to be seen (probably because its too damn early?!?!) So he is 99.99% sure its a failed interuterine pregnancy and wanted to schedule the d&c the next day! Of course, I said no way, and he got a little defensive and said he wasnt pushing us into any decision, but wanted to check the numbers again today before we really decided if surgery was the best option. Well, todays numbers are 1402, and they called and still want me to get more blood work and an u/s on Monday and to not eat anything before hand in case we have to do surgery. 

Ok, besides the extreme ups and downs that my wife and I have just been through, at this point it is right for me to think that something is terribly wrong that he wont even suggest that it could be viable? Dont get me wrong, ectopic is very dangerous and obviously not worth any risk, but as of today we really dont know what is going on, and with the next u/s we might be able to see something. 

Am i crazy though for having some hope that its viable, because my FE sure doesn't. Just because the beta hcg's were not perfect in the 60% rise early on means its all over for sure?

Dont get me wrong, ectopic is very dangerous and obviously not worth any risk, but as of today we really dont know what is going on, and with the next <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a> we might be able to see something. </p>

<p>Am i crazy though for having some hope that its viable, because my FE sure doesn&#39;t. Just because the beta hcg&#39;s were not perfect in the 60% rise early on means its all over for sure? I really wanted to ask him if he has seen Jurassic Park and remembers that &quot;life finds a way.&quot;</p>

After taking a break from shots, doctors appointments, and disappointment, I'm back at it. We are starting round 3 of IVF. This one is my second FET. I have three left and three will be transferred. So here's where I am. 

I started lupron shots on Jan. 31, 20 units in the evening every day. I started my period on Feb. 9. It was a normal cycle. I have endometriosis and fibroids, so my normal isn't actually normal. I had a blood draw on Feb. 11 and results were high, 69.8 pg/mL. They said to continue lupron and draw in another week. I don't have the numbers yet, but IVF coordinator called yesterday and said that my levels were higher than they were before and that I need to come in for an ultrasound on Monday. She mentioned maybe it's from a cyst. I think she said that if my lining is thin, we'll proceed, but if it's thick, we'll have to induce my period, but since I just ended my period on Monday or Tuesday, she was just going to wait to see what the U/S says. 

She is a huge worrier and if something is wrong, she tells me. I asked if I should worry and she said no, she's not worried. I guess I'm more frustrated than anything that I have yet another hoop to jump through. Dates keep getting bumped and because of work obligations, I may not be able to do this until April now. 

So my question, other than a cyst, any thoughts on why my Estradiol level is increasing rather than decreasing like it's suppose to? If it is a cyst, did I hear her correctly when I thought she said if my lining is thin, we can still proceed? I have had 5 cysts removed over the last 4 years, (two very large ones in 2012, 7cm and 11.5cm, and three smaller ones in 2015, two 1cm and one 6cm as well endometriosis removal) so I'm guessing I have another one. 

Thanks everyone!

I made a different account just for privacy's sake. I've been TTC for two years with my husband, and I have PCOS. I don't ovulate on my own at all. My HSG showed that both tubes are blocked, but y fertility doctor wants me to repeat to see if they open up if I am less anxious and the uterus isn't cramping so hard. so I have to do a 4th round of clomid.

My angry rant is because of an issue with a friend that I do not know how to handle or deal with... 

A close friend announced her pregnancy, and since then, I've been eating my feelings. I'm trying to understand my emotions. I'm rationalizing that the way in which she told me was what made me upset, and that she told me she wanted to wait until I got pregnant but then didn't tell me when she decided she didn't want to wait. 

In December, she told me that she wanted to be pregnant with me, and said she would wait until I got pregnant, and then get herself pregnant as she's a very fertile woman. In January she reinforced that sentiment, which I found comforting and so kind that she wanted to wait for me. At dinner with friends a few weeks ago she blurted out in conversation something about ""I'll be pregnant"" and quickly looked at me to see if I was paying attention... I chose not to react. 

This weekend when I invited some girls over to bake, she went to my bathroom and helped herself to two of my pregnancy tests that she found. She called me down to show me, and there was definitely a faint line on one. It wasn't an evaporation line because she'd only been in there a few minutes. Then she showed me pictures of more pregnancy tests she had taken previously with dark lines on them, not squinters at all and was like ""omg I don't know if I'm pregnant. I mean it's too early right?"" (She was 6DPO) What the hell am I supposed to say to that? A positive is a positive! I tried to act excited and congratulated her. 

When everyone else showed up, she announced to the room that she is pregnant and is really hoping for a girl and showed off pictures of all her positive tests including the ones she took from my bathroom. I held it all in so I could entertain my guests. The next morning she texts me saying she took a digital test and it said not pregnant (probably because she was 6DPO with a clear blue) and she was talking like she was trying to make me feel better because maybe she's not pregnant. 

I tried my best to tell her that peeing on 20 tests will not make her more or less pregnant and wait until she's missed Her period and considering she's already seeing lines on her tests and timed sex, she's probably pregnant. She started going on and on about fundraising for my fertility treatments which really looked like it was coming from guilt. I feel like if I react at all I just sound like a jealous infertile.

I'm not jealous, I'm not mad at her for wanting another baby (she has two boys), I am angry that she knows I have been trying for two years and that I am struggling with infertility and she helped herself to my pregnancy tests and flaunted it all afternoon... I just don't want to talk to her right now and the way she's texting me I can tell she's trying to still be involved in my TTC journey but I just don't want to share with her right now. she's texting me today asking about an update on my recent fertility doctor appt and I really don't want to talk to her about it... but if I say anything at all, she's just going to go complain to everyone that I am being a jealous bitter infertile and I'm mad that she's pregnant.

My husband received a new job offer today and when we glanced through the benefits, one of the medical plans offered will cover up to $15,000 in fertility meds and $25,000 in infertility treatment (lifetime). We're not 100% sure it's a plan we'll have access to, but it appears we might. He'll find out Friday whether or not we'll qualify. 

I honestly don't even know how to process the information. After discussing it, we had to ditched the idea of IVF because it just wasn't financially feasible given my grad loans among other things (particularly if more than one round is needed, and I like to plan realistically). The insurance deductible is fairly high at $4000, so I'm thinking anything that gets done should get started soon so that we have the rest of the calendar year. 

I have anovulatory PCOS and husband has poor morphology (2% strict). I apologize if I don't entirely yet belong here (though I've posted a few times) - we haven't been trying for nearly as long as some of you, but every cycle has failed including our recent IUI, so our RE addressed IVF - I think she's in the morph likely = icsi camp. 

What's the best way to go about making the most of the insurance coverage? Here's our spot now: We'll be moving to a new city for husband's job and my job will transfer. My parents live in the same city we're moving to. They graciously agreed to allow us to stay with them for a few months to pay off debt so that we can purchase a house - they will likely be fine if we stay an extra month or two to manage the deductible.

Should we go through with two more IUIs and see how they go and then move on to IVF if needed? IUIs will be out of pocket and will meet about half the deductible, so those shouldn't impact benefits. Given the poor morph, should we just skip the IUIs and pay the deductible straight toward IVF? I feel overwhelmed by sudden options that I thought we'd never have.

<p>I&#39;m not sure why posting on reddit seems to give me some sort of relief, but I am scared. I&#39;m scared of losing my relationship to this. At the same time, I&#39;m trying to give him what he also wants (a baby) the only way I can see is acceptable. </p>

My betas were low (although they did double), and my first ultrasound had a sac that was a little small. My RE wasn't overly concerned with the first ultrasound since it was so early, but by now I definitely should have had something fetal in there. 

I was given the option of D&C vs cytotec (misoprostol) to induce a miscarriage since I have had no signs of bleeding or miscarrying on my own. I think I am opting for the cytotec. I've heard that in some people it can cause pretty terrible bleeding and cramps, and other people just have something like a heavy period. I hope it's not too terrible. Luckily I already had a vacation from work scheduled for next week, so I think I will work the rest of this week and take the cytotec next Monday. I had plans of traveling out of town this weekend for a friend's wedding, and I'm still trying to decide whether I should still go or cancel. I know I won't have much fun, but I also know sitting at home being sad won't be fun either. I'm not sure which option is worse. 

I'm lucky that I have such a wonderful husband and family and friends to be supportive.

I just wanted to make a post saying hello, since I've been finding myself doing a lot of lurking lately. It's been over two years, and no living baby. I was once pregnant for 18 weeks, but that pregnancy was unsuccessful due to incompetent cervix. 
     
I've had a lot of difficulty accepting that I actually am experiencing infertility. I keep finding myself hoping that we are simply doing something wrong, and that all the issues that have popped up are just one time bad luck, and that the next month will work. So far, no dice. (Issues so far have been fibroids, anovulation/poor ovulation seemingly due to an underdeveloped ovary, thin lining.)
      
We did a letrozole/Ovidrel/IUI last month and it didn't work. We've also done ovidrel/letrozole/timed intercourse and letrozole/timed intercourse. I'm hoping to do another IUI this month, but the RE I saw this month for my monitoring ultrasound was not impressed with my lining, which was at best a 4 on cd12. I'm taking estradiol to try to bulk it up, but she's not convinced it's going to do much since my lining was still thin at my IUI last cycle. 
      
I actually really liked the substitute RE that I saw at this last appointment. With my primary RE, I no longer find him proactive enough. He told us to go ahead with the IUI last cycle, despite my lining being sub-optimal. He's also been resistant to more intensive diagnostics. He initially suggested an HSG before starring IUIs, and then decided that the SHG was sufficient. He's downplayed my concerns about uterine scarring (I've had three D&Cs) and insisted that the SHG would have brought any abnormalities to light. Does he sound a bit laissez-faire to anyone else, or is it possibly my anxiety that is creating this bias?

<p>I just wanted to make a post saying hello, since I&#39;ve been finding myself doing a lot of lurking lately. It&#39;s been over two years, and no living baby. I was once pregnant for 18 weeks, but that pregnancy was unsuccessful due to incompetent cervix. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a lot of difficulty accepting that I actually am experiencing infertility. I keep finding myself hoping that we are simply doing something wrong, and that all the issues that have popped up are just one time bad luck, and that the next month will work. So far, no dice. (Issues so far have been fibroids, anovulation/poor ovulation seemingly due to an underdeveloped ovary, thin lining.)</p>

<p>We did a letrozole/Ovidrel/IUI last month and it didn&#39;t work. We&#39;ve also done ovidrel/letrozole/timed intercourse and letrozole/timed intercourse.

After a lot of long conversations, consideration, a move to Austin, Texas (to get away from the cold for my CRPS) we decided to find a fertility doctor here. We are on the path to finally starting our little family but what do you know? Our insurance doesn't cover fertility treatments or IVF because it's considered elective.

Bit worried about our results, especially my husband's.

Sperm count and morphology are normal (34m/ml and 60%), but motility is very low at 85% immotile, 10% sluggish and only 5% progressively motile. 

There's also a moderately high white cells, indicating an infection in his tracks. We're both starting a 10 days large spectrum antibiotics and for him 3 months of vitamins (fertiman) and syrup (mucosolvan) to increase the liquid secretions.

Has anyone done that before? Did it work? The infection can sometimes impact the quality of the sperm, so we're hoping that with antibiotics then vitamins+syrup, it gets better over time.

As for me, I've got a low ovarian reserve, with a score of 1.94.

Additionally, I've also gone through infertility treatment myself.  

Between my company's research and personal experience, there seems to be a far more significant focus on the female than the male when it comes to fertility care. I've also seen that most men are all but absent from the process of fertility care and women are responsible for making sure the care happens. Finally, there is a substantial diagnostic bias toward women, even when we know the cause of infertility is 50% women, 50% men.

Without question, infertility is a complex emotional process and the psychological stress each person experiences is unique. That being said, I'm wondering why men aren't doing more.

So, that leads me to my question: are your male partners not participating more because a) there simply isn't much more they can do or b) they are simply afraid of the whole process? Or, maybe they are participating enough?

The doc told me we can start IVF whenever we are ready. He did not mention anything about my weight, though I do have weight to lose. My BMI is around 33 or 34.  

My husband will turn 39 next month and I'm 36 (and a half!). I feel like we should just go straight for the IVF, which would mean starting in the next couple days once cycle day 2 is here. If not, we won't be able to do it until April, because we will be travelling during the important dates next month. 

However, he thinks I should try to lose weight first and then do it. And he has a point but I feel like he doesn't get the whole age factor thing, especially if we want to try for multiple kids. Last August, I wanted us to go have a checkup when we were unsuccessfully TTC and he pushed me to wait. And then I resented losing another 4 months because we waited until Nov to find out all this news. All the waiting just makes it all so much more stressful.

<p>My husband will turn 39 next month and I&#39;m 36 (and a half!). I feel like we should just go straight for the IVF, which would mean starting in the next couple days once cycle day 2 is here.

<p>However, he thinks I should try to lose weight first and then do it. And he has a point but I feel like he doesn&#39;t get the whole age factor thing, especially if we want to try for multiple kids.

And then I resented losing another 4 months because we waited until Nov to find out all this news. All the waiting just makes it all so much more stressful.</p>

133,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I wanted to share some thoughts with you all on infertility treatments after 40. Please do take all of this with a grain of salt. I'm no expert. My story is that I didn't find the right guy until late in life, and both of us had given up on having children by the time our relationship was ready for them. So when, at 40, I stopped using birth control and got pregnant, we were thrilled. Neither one of us thought this was possible (now we feel a bit silly about that) but we both realized that we wanted a baby and started making plans.

Unfortunately, that pregnancy didn't last long. I miscarried at 5 weeks and went straight to a doctor to discuss options. 

My doctor was very straightforward. At 40 (almost 41) my chances were small. She asked me to do some tests, which showed a high FSH and normal AMH (I don't remember the numbers) and recommended that I go for IVF immediately. When I googled the numbers, I realized that many clinics wouldn't even take someone at my age with my numbers. My doctor was very straightforward in telling me that she could not predict how long I'd have enough ovarian reserve to even try to get pregnant in the future. Hence the need for IVF.

I listened to her and immediately started IVF. As I looked up success rates for women my age (by then 41) I realized my odds were small. Some websites said that less than 10% of women had babies after one round of IVF. I started to regret my decision - why put myself through this if I had such a low chance? 

My doctor also insisted on PGS. Because of my age, she said, the rate of abnormal embryos was likely to be high and she wanted to maximize my chances. After my egg retrieval, where we got 6 eggs, and 5 embryos made it to day 4, I was sure she was wrong and my chances were high. But when these 5 embryos were tested, only 1 was normal. 1!! I again looked up what had happened, wondering if maybe something was wrong with the lab, only to find out that at my age about 80% of embryos are abnormal. So without PGS, I would have randomly implanted 3 of the 5 embryos, and I would have either been lucky and one of those three would have been the normal one, or I would have had another unexplained miscarriage.

I can't tell you the end of the story, because it hasn't yet ended (and I hope the ending is a good one), but what I wanted to say is that I learned a lot from these last few months. First, I learned that it is quite possible to get pregnant after 40, but what is hard it to keep the pregnancy going, given the high rates of chromosomal abnormalities. For me, the most sad part of the process is realizing that you have miscarried, and that the little life you thought you were carrying wasn't meant to be. Because of this, the second thing I learned was that I would do whatever it takes to reduce the chances of miscarriage. This includes PGS and anything else I can think of (no caffeine, no travel, no excessive exercise). I also learned that given how our bodies work, IVF+PGS seems like the best option for anyone over 40. It is expensive and difficult but considering how quickly we stop producing viable eggs after 40, I  don't see any other good options. 

In any case, those are my thoughts.

140,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi friends. I got to go on an embarrassing adventure to the ER yesterday. Here's what happened:

Woke up on CD2 with super heavy bleeding. My femara periods have been a flood for the 1st 2 days. I drove downtown to teach my friends yoga. Afterward, we went to brunch. We shared a bottle of champagne for mimosas. I normally would need to pee like 3 times in 2 hours, but I only had to go once while were at the restaurant.

On the way home, I stopped at the grocery store to grab some super bowl snacks. Realized I had to pee and the bathroom at the store was closed. As I was walking back to my car, it started to feel like the worst cramps of my life combined with a serious UTI level need to pee. Home was less than 5 minutes away. I literally stopped the car in the driveway and then walked as slowly as possible inside because walking was extremely painful.

Got to the bathroom and nothing would happen. I then realized something was seriously wrong. I made my husband help me to the shower because at this point even standing up was feeling impossible. I sat under the water for 15 minutes trying to get my muscles to relax. It felt like my whole insides were in one giant knot. We called my mom and she of course told my husband to take me to the emergency room.

Trying to get dressed was absolutely miserable. I was essentially rolling around on the bathroom floor. And of course my husband starts making jokes because he was freaking out and that's his defense mechanism. Laughing was not helpful :p

Got to the emergency room. Got to fill out 5 pages of paperwork because that's reasonable. They took me back and my nurse was asking about my medication. As soon as I said femara, she knew that was the issue. She is a fellow IF sister and went to the same clinic as me. 

They asked me for a urine sample (hah!!) and at this point I was able to give them a little bit. They did an ultrasound and the doctor said my bladder was still completely full and to try one more time. At this point I suppose it had been over an hour and my body finally relaxed enough to go. It was the most glorious pee of my life.

They gave me a printout showing that this is a femara side effect. Additionally the nurse chatted with me about our clinic, asked what my protocol was so far, and gave me some tips. She said that after 5 medicated cycles, you really should give your body a break. She also warned me about the clinic wanting to push for lesser treatments until you demand it (which is what I'm going to do today at my CD3 appointment since I want to move forward with IUI).

Finally got discharged because my body decided to stop being insane. It was seriously the most unpleasant 2 hours of my life thus far. 

**TL;DR** - femara put my body on lockdown so I couldn't pee and it was absolute torture. My husband tries to make me laugh when I am in miserable pain. IF-knowledgeable nurse was very helpful. Fertility drugs do crazy shit to your body.

**Update:** Went to my CD3 baseline appt and my RE said she's never heard of this happening before. She thinks it was just really bad cramps and my period is so different now since I'm actually ovulating. I don't know if I agree - the cramps were horrible, but this was like a totally different level of my entire insides screaming at me. I told her I'm willing to try femara again in hopes that this was a one time incident and I want an IUI this time. She said since I'm ovulating on femara, there's no need for an HCG trigger and that studies with clomid/trigger show that success rates are usually better if you wait for your natural surge.

A couple months ago, when my husband did his first SA and we got the bad results, I had my depression, crying bouts etc. At the same time, every single person on Facebook was either pregnant or announcing births. Grrrr. I'm feeling better about things now because at least we have a game plan. 

BUT that said, two of my close friends just had their babies in the last month. For friend A, I'm really happy for her. She has some health issues and I know it worried her but it was all fine.

However, I want to smack friend B. I feel so angry/jealous/resentful to her. She has PCOS and was always convinced she'd never get pregnant without IVF. And constantly would tell people about it. And then when she did (after constantly talking about trying, hilariously announcing at the bar when she had to get home because she was ovulating, etc), she was telling me how it took her forever and that they actively tried for 10 months before it happened. Ugh.
And so, it's been a constant barrage of pregnancy photo shoots on social media, links to articles about pregnancy, etc. You'd swear she was the first person to ever be pregnant. 

Then when she had the baby, she sent me a pic but I realized she never announced it on FB and knew she wouldn't post anything without it being ""perfect"". Low and behold, a week later she announces the birth using a professionally done portrait of her and the baby. Perfect hair and makeup. With the usual annoying hashtags ""#can'tbelieveI'mamommy! #somuchfunbeingamommy!"".

Meanwhile, Friend A posts a makeup-free selfie of her, hubby and baby sitting on the couch. Like a normal f*cking human being.

We just got confirmation a few days ago that we have to do IVF due to MFI. It&#39;s a  year now we have been actively TTC with tracking etc, though we were trying before that too. 
A couple months ago, when my husband did his first SA and we got the bad results, I had my depression, crying bouts etc. At the same time, every single person on Facebook was either pregnant or announcing births. Grrrr. I&#39;m feeling better about things now because at least we have a game plan. </p>

<p>BUT that said, two of my close friends just had their babies in the last month. For friend A, I&#39;m really happy for her. She has some health issues and I know it worried her but it was all fine.</p>

<p>However, I want to smack friend B. I feel so angry/jealous/resentful to her. She has PCOS and was always convinced she&#39;d never get pregnant without IVF. And constantly would tell people about it. And then when she did (after constantly talking about trying, hilariously announcing at the bar when she had to get home because she was ovulating, etc), she was telling me how it took her forever and that they actively tried for 10 months before it happened. Ugh.
And so, it&#39;s been a constant barrage of pregnancy photo shoots on social media, links to articles about pregnancy, etc. You&#39;d swear she was the first person to ever be pregnant. </p>

<p>Then when she had the baby, she sent me a pic but I realized she never announced it on FB and knew she wouldn&#39;t post anything without it being &quot;perfect&quot;. Low and behold, a week later she announces the birth using a professionally done portrait of her and the baby. Perfect hair and makeup. With the usual annoying hashtags &quot;#can&#39;tbelieveI&#39;mamommy! #somuchfunbeingamommy!&quot;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Friend A posts a makeup-free selfie of her, hubby and baby sitting on the couch. Like a normal f*cking human being. </p>

My husband and me starting ttc in Oct '13, in Dec I got my first positive pregnancy test. I couple days before Christmas I started to bleed heavily, it was a cervical ectopic pregnancy treated with methotrexate. In a follow up exam my obgyn said she didn't she any reason why we wouldn't be able to conceive again. 

From March 14 to June 15 we tried with no success, I used opks, tracked my cycles etc and nothing. My obgyn ordered the day 3 blood test and hsg, both came back good. 
In June '15 we had out first consult with an RE, since my tests were good and my SO's SA results were good he recommended iui with clomid and trigger. 

My first iui resulted in a pregnancy but the hcg levels never went up enough. My second iui didn't work and my third resulted in a pregnancy that stopped growing a little after 6 weeks. This was in January, SO and me are devastated and now it appears also dealing with RPL. On the day I would have been 8 weeks we had a procedure done, the POC was sent for genetic testing. I got the results yesterday that the fetus had trisomy 8. 

Here's were I'm hoping for some advice, I'm 32 and it appears with iui I can get pregnant. We have a consult Monday morning with our RE to discuss what's next. Is ivf the next logical step? I'm assuming that my eggs are probably poor quality, I've read online that taking CoQ10 and DHEA over a few months can improve egg quality. Has anyone here tried it?

161,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I had a lap today and while it is fresh I wanted to write a detailed experience for anyone who is interested.

I have unexplained infertility. I should be the most fertile person ever- perfect AMH, FSH, hormones, etc. I respond well to meds. Husband has huge sperm count- around 400-550million, 35% motility- which isn't good but more than makes up for it in count, and okay morphology. Both have normal karyotypes. I've done a RLP and have slightly elevated PAI-1, which is a clotting thingie, but I've been told that tons of people have it and it's not a big deal but they do put on on lovenex for egg transfers. My thyroid is well controlled and not due to Hashi's. I don't have celiac's disease. My two IVFs were weird. A lap was the next step to figure out if there was asymptomatic endometriosis. 

To prep for this, my RE asked that I stop all supplements and vitamins for 2 weeks, the metformin for 3 days, bath the night before, and not eat or drink after midnight.  I wondered about lady-grooming and opted to go ahead and groom a bit.  I'm not a full bare lady, I like a patch of hair but I tightened up the boundaries, if you know what I mean.  

My lap was done at a surgery center. We checked in at the front desk and I was called back sans husband to get ready.  I was in one of those big rooms sectioned off with curtains. They asked for a urine sample. I assume it was to check if I'm pregnant (lol, no) but they had the tact not to say that. I got naked and put on my gown and those no-slip socks. The nurse placed the IV in my hand and started saline. The saline made my mouth taste funny and I felt a tad nauseated, but that could have easily been nerves.  I really hate needles and IVs are the worst.  (I use [tattoo numbing cream](http://www.amazon.com/NumbMAX-Maximum-Strength-Topical-Anesthetic/dp/B018A0VI6G/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1454710691&sr=8-8&keywords=tattoo+numbing+cream) and I swear it helps.  I also use it for blood draws.)  The nurse gave me an anti-nausea patch for behind my hear and said I can wear it for 3 days but it gives many people dry mouth. The nurse then got husband.  We waited for 10-20 minutes and then the anesthesiologist came in and asked me about allergies and if I've had bad experiences with anesthesia prior.  I've never had any sort of surgery other than egg retrievals and I know this anesthesia is general instead of twilight.  Then my RE came in and discussed the procedure.  We did a laparoscopic inspection of the outside of my uterus, ovaries, and surrounding areas, a hysterscopy to look inside my uterus, and he ran dye through my tubes again.  He also injected some sort of oil into my uterus after everything. I can't remember what it is called but he said it helps IVF be successful 2.4% more.  I will be sure to ask more about this oil at my follow up in a couple weeks.  If he found endo he would remove it. He asked me what my favorite pain medication was and I laughed and told him I don't have a drug of choice, that whatever is usually fine. 

A nurse then walked me back to the surgery area.  It was cold as fuck back there, I was reasonably sure my nipples were attempting to revolt off my body. I laid down on the table and the lovely nurses bundled me up with blankets (perhaps fearing for their eyes if my nipple goes pinging around the room like a stray bullet).  I did not have to schooch, I got to lay in the middle of the table! Woo!  There were heavy duty stirrups but I didn't have to place my legs in them. The anesthesiologist said he was running some lidocaine into the IV, which was extremely cold, made my mouth taste medicine-y, and made me slightly nauseated.  Then he started the propofol, which burns a little going in the hand, and the room started to get spinny, the ceiling started the wave like an ocean, and you have flashbacks of being in college and drinking way too much apple cider and vodka that one night, and that's all I remember until waking up.

I woke up in the recovery room- another one of those large rooms with curtains- to a nurse saying my name. I had three immediate and pressing concerns: I had to pee like a motherfucker, I had painful intense cramping, and I was pretty nauseated. I decided that peeing was the most important problem at that moment. The nurse said I probably didn't have to pee, but the catheter had irritated my urethra and was making me feel that way, but she got me a bedpan anyway, and a washcloth. Using a bedpan is another first for me today; she was right, I didn't have to pee, very little came out but I held the washcloth on my urethra for a few minutes and that helped. The nausea and cramping were pretty bad, so the nurse gave me some ginger ale and saltines and said I needed to eat a couple before taking the pain pill (norco, 7.5).  Never has a person ever been more grumpy while choking down saltine crackers. They turned to a crazy dry paste in my mouth and it took all of my yoga breathing to get them down and stay down.  The nurse helped me into my underwear with a pad in it, and then into a chair, and she swore sitting up with my knees drawn in would help, and again, she was right.  I felt really woozy, disoriented, and dizzy. The anesthesiologist came in and told me the nausea was normal and that young, smaller, women were most likely to get it and he had given me tons of anti-nausea meds in my IV.  I didn't have any gas/shoulder pain. The nurse got husband and it seemed like very quickly they were telling me I could get dressed and leave if I wanted. The RE came in and gave husband a CD of the procedure and a quick synopsis of what they found.  The pain meds kicked in and the cramps were better so husband dressed me and we and came home.

The cramps and nausea have continued to get better.  I napped until husband woke me to make more pain meds (he's very concerned about 'staying in front of the pain'.)  I've been hanging out with the pups and cats, watching netflix, and doing okay.  Shoulders are okay i I am laying down and get moderately ouchy if I am upright, nausea gone, cramping is gone too.  I have muscle weakness and the feeling of very sore muscles in my lower belly, like I did the worst most vicious pilates workout. Super dry mouth.  I have two incisions in addition to the belly button.  Oh!  And THEY SHAVED ME!  Got a surprise when I saw that!  Wish they would have taken the opportunity to do a nice full Brazilian wax.  I've always wanted to try it but don't want to suffer through it.  My throat isn't sore but I have a pretty raspy 30+ years-two-packs-per-day smokers voice right now.  I am bleeding about the amount of a light-medium period day.  Peeing is unpleasant- a little like peeing when I have a UTI, but I don't have the constant urgency.  I feel pretty sleepy and lovey-dovey towards husband. I can stand up straight and walk around by myself. Overall I would say that I'm having an easier time of it than many.

Preliminary results, if interested.  I had 1-2 tiny spots of endo on each ovary and 2 or 3 spots on the back of my uterus and bladder.  On the cd my doc says 'well, hopefully that was enough to be significant' and in person I asked him if it was enough to explain the infertility and he shrugged and said 'well, it wasn't helping', which I took as a noncommittal no. Inside of uterus looked good, tubes looked perfect.  

Endo is a terrible disease and I'm happy not to have it. I am now even more concerned about that elusive thing called egg quality that can't be tested for.  I feel like we are running out of other explanations.  I have a follow-up appointment with the RE in a couple weeks.

And I have a CD of the procedure!  Pretty nifty!  Ovaries and uteruses are way tinier than I thought!

Questions welcome. 

EDIT: also, the subject of kids somehow came up with my recovery nurse and I asked her if she had kids.  She said she was expecting in May after needing fertility help.  It made me feel happy and weepy for her.  Part of the sisterhood!

Edit 2, the next day: Super sore and tender belly. Difficult to engage those muscles so getting up out of bed sounds like a series of grunts and positive self talk 'okay, Salty, you can do this, 1, 2, 3, UP!'. Shoulder/gas pain still happens when I am upright for more than a minute or two, which is annoying because I'm getting bored laying around. Mildly sore throat. I took the nausea patch off so my dry mouth is much better.  Still taking a norco about every 4 hours to stay comfortable.

EDIT 3: Two days after surgery. I'm feeling a ton better. Gas pain in my shoulders and diaphragm yesterday got pretty intense, far more painful than my belly incisions. Went on a 45 minute very slow walk to try to work it out, not sure if it helped, but I'm good today.  Took a shower and graduated from PJs to leggings. Not even feeling like I need the pain meds today.

<p>I have unexplained infertility. I should be the most fertile person ever- perfect AMH, FSH, hormones, etc. I respond well to meds. Husband has huge sperm count- around 400-550million, 35% motility- which isn&#39;t good but more than makes up for it in count, and okay morphology. Both have normal karyotypes. I&#39;ve done a RLP and have slightly elevated PAI-1, which is a clotting thingie, but I&#39;ve been told that tons of people have it and it&#39;s not a big deal but they do put on on lovenex for egg transfers. My thyroid is well controlled and not due to Hashi&#39;s. I don&#39;t have celiac&#39;s disease. My two IVFs were weird. A lap was the next step to figure out if there was asymptomatic endometriosis. </p>

<p>To prep for this, my RE asked that I stop all supplements and vitamins for 2 weeks, the metformin for 3 days, bath the night before, and not eat or drink after midnight.  I wondered about lady-grooming and opted to go ahead and groom a bit.  I&#39;m not a full bare lady, I like a patch of hair but I tightened up the boundaries, if you know what I mean.  </p>

<p>My lap was done at a surgery center. We checked in at the front desk and I was called back sans husband to get ready.  I was in one of those big rooms sectioned off with curtains. They asked for a urine sample. I assume it was to check if I&#39;m pregnant (lol, no) but they had the tact not to say that. I got naked and put on my gown and those no-slip socks. The nurse placed the IV in my hand and started saline. The saline made my mouth taste funny and I felt a tad nauseated, but that could have easily been nerves.  I really hate needles and IVs are the worst.  (I use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/NumbMAX-Maximum-Strength-Topical-Anesthetic/dp/B018A0VI6G/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454710691&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=tattoo+numbing+cream"">tattoo numbing cream</a> and I swear it helps.  I also use it for blood draws.)  The nurse gave me an anti-nausea patch for behind my hear and said I can wear it for 3 days but it gives many people dry mouth. The nurse then got husband.  We waited for 10-20 minutes and then the anesthesiologist came in and asked me about allergies and if I&#39;ve had bad experiences with anesthesia prior.  I&#39;ve never had any sort of surgery other than egg retrievals and I know this anesthesia is general instead of twilight.  Then my RE came in and discussed the procedure.

163,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Backstory: Been trying for 1.5 years, found out I had a low sperm count last summer, started on Clomid which has increased my count to the low end of normal (motility and morphology is still lousy though). No known issues with my wife but no success so far.

So, we decided we should finally make an appointment to see and RE to make sure there aren't some hidden issues with my wife and to get the ball rolling for IUI if we continue to be unsuccessful. The problem is, we live 2.5 hours from the nearest fertility clinic. I asked if we could do the initial consultation on the phone and was told that the doctor requires anyone ""local"" to do it in-person and basically won't do a phone consult unless you need to fly to get there.

So we both took off work at lunchtime yesterday and drove all the way there, gave them all our info and past test results. We were hoping that we'd be able to do some initial tests while we were there (at least the blood draws or SA). Instead we had a brief (<15 minutes) and  rushed meeting with the doctor, who too one look at my latest (improved) SA results and seemed to adopt the attitude of ""why are you here? you're fine."" He said that we will want to do HSG and ultrasound on my wife but those will require two separate visits and he doesn't trust the doctors in our home town to do them so we have to drive all the way to his office on short notice dictated by my wife's cycle. 

I was hoping he would at least provide us some more information on IUI, IVF, etc. but he didn't. Luckily I've been hanging out in this sub long enough that I know a lot more than most people, but still, you'd think at the initial visit the doctor would explain things to you. Maybe I would have had more questions if he had spent any time at all talking about the procedures! It would have been nice to at least hear him say ""Oh yes, I've seen cases similar to yours before. Here's what we did and the success rate, etc.""

So we ended up skipping half a day of work and driving 5 hours (2.5 there, 2.5 back) for a 15 minute conversation that didn't tell us anything new which could have been done over the phone. And we were charged $290 dollars for the privilege. I was really hoping to start getting the tests done as soon as possible and to have an informative conversation with a caring doctor to make the trip worthwhile. But nope, that will require several more trips.

Sigh. At least we've started the process. I'll feel a lot better about continuing to try to conceive naturally once my wife is tested and we can be sure there aren't any complications on her side. And it will be nice to have a plan to start trying IUIs after a certain amount of time if that turns out to be the next step.

Anyway, TL;DR - Had to skip work and drive to RE's office 2.5 hours away for a brusque 15 minute meeting that didn't particularly make us feel welcome and didn't teach us anything new or give us much more of a plan than we already had.

If you end up pregnant, taking birth control when you are pregnant doesn't hurt anything because birth control basically tells your body you are pregnant already. So it is safe to assume that birth control helps spike the hormones that your body naturally produces when pregnant.

I'm new to this thread and I guess to the world of infertility. I'm 36, husband is 38. We've been actively trying for most of 2015 and my ""plan"" was to get pregnant before my 36th bday in September. Well it didn't happen for me, though apparently every single woman I've met in my life did get pregnant... sigh. 

Anyway, in November, I decided we needed to make sure all was good. I was convinced my hypothyroidism, though controlled, was the issue. The RE had me do  all the blood tests, HSG, etc and all was fine. My husband's semen analysis was not fine however. 
His count was under 1 million with 8% viability, low motility, basically bad all around. He took HCG shots for 2 months and I had him on a whole cocktail of vitamins, tried to improve diet (though there was a lot of holiday drinking). We also saw a urologist who just said wait for the second results and then we'll see.

We got the second results yesterday - viability went up to 12%, some slight improvement, but the count is still at 1 million (which I think really means 1 million or less). 

The thing is, my husband had an ex-gf who got pregnant from him years ago. So he was fertile at one point. I also only found out when this started that he had surgery as a child to lower an undescended testicle. So that's obviously a factor against us.

I'm on the edge waiting for our next appt. Is the RE going to say, go straight to IVF/ICSI? or are there test they can do to make sure it's not some sort of physical issue with him - blockage or the like? Or since there was a little bit of improvement with the meds, to keep doing that for longer? Seems like IUI is not an option right now and I'm eager to get going with my age.

So, my Gf (29) doc ordered some lab analysis for both of us because we haven’t get pregnant in 18 months, although the first year of our relation we actually got pregnant but a miscarriage happen, the next year and a half we haven’t use any birth control method other than the classic “pull out”.

My semen analysis came back and it seems pretty regular in almost everything but the sperm morphology: 22% are normal but then it says 52% has head defects; 50% middle body defects and 15% shows tail defects.

How bad are those abnormal sperm morphology numbers?

It would be super if you can help me a little with the interpretation of those numbers. In addition here is the full analysis because I don’t know if I’m missing out something important:

Since I had my IUI I've had symptoms,  nausea,  sore boobs,  light cramps, tiredness,  metallic taste and just generally feel 'odd'. 

Last night I laid awake feeling really sick with quite strong cramps,  it felt like tiny feet tip tapping on my uterus.  

I know it's early but I read the trigger (250mcg) takes about 7 days to leave the body so I wondered if anyone had 'tested out'  the trigger from their systems?  If so how many days did it take?  I was thinking of getting a test today,  at least if it's a BFN now I know the trigger has moved on.

My husband and I are going on a cruise to Belize, Cozumel (Mexico), Carnival's island off the coast of Honduras, and Grand Cayman next week! I'm so pumped. 

Then, I realized that I should probably read up on this virus that's spreading around South America - the Zika virus. It can cause major birth defects if pregnant women contract it. Currently, Mexico and Honduras are on the CDC's affected list, Grand Cayman and Belize are not. 

I had an ultrasound for my third Clomid cycle yesterday and had two follicles at 13mm, meaning with how my body reacts I will likely be ovulating while on the cruise and since we're doing timed intercourse, well there will be intercourse. Also we're in the middle of moving and if I need to find another RE, it will take at least several months so I definitely don't want to waste this cycle.

But now - what should I do? Skip our jungle kayaking excursion in Belize and stay close to the ship/beach? Just wear bug spray and long pants? Find a way to cancel everything? Officials are asking women who live in some countries (not the ones I'm visiting) to not get pregnant until the outbreak is sorted, but I'm just visiting some of the ""heightened advisory"" areas for less than a day each. What would you do? 

Edit: Here's a bit from an article where they interviewed a doc. Seems like we'd be right on the cusp of will it / won't it because after ovulation there's still time before implantation and when a fetus shares the blood supply, but that's not ""weeks"" afterward. 

>The good news: If you get bit by a Zika-infected mosquito and become pregnant a few weeks later, the virus won’t harm the unborn baby, the CDC says.

It is unexplained infertility for us. I didn't want to get my hopes up back in August but unfortunately I did and really thought that the polyp removal would help us get pregnant. It didn't. We did our first IUI (letrosol meds and ovidrel shot) in January. Still not pregnant. In the process of the second IUI and suspect we'll be at this for a few more months. Just found out that our insurance doesn't cover any aspect of IVF so if the IUI doesn't work at some point, we're not sure what we will do.

What a miracle, right??  10 years of menopause and at 35 and you are pregnant?  Its amazing.  

So I am in the middle of this DE cycle and hoping that, obviously, it will work.  We have run the entire gamut of this - like acupuncture, weird Chinese teas, little Chinese pills, moxa sticks, nettles extracts, CoQ10, DEA, IUI, IVF, a camping trip, relaxing, whatever - just everything science, non-science, stupid and not stupid and it has all been super depressing and nothing has worked.  So we are here.  So yesterday my beta came back negative and I was sad and shocked despite my best emotional preparations, and zen like knowledge that we can do this again.  

So with her miracle pregnancy my sister has become a complete expert on fertility!  She was like, you really need to use a heating pad on your stomach and go to acupuncture 3 times a week and shake your body a lot so your blood starts to flow and I was like, 'I totally get that you are coming from a place of kindness but I have actually done all of these things and am finding my own ways to process', and so then she started sending me links to acupuncture near my office and I'm just like dude fucking chill.  Stop blaming me for not doing something.  Your advice isn't real or fair and I don't appreciate it.  I have a plan for how to process and remain calm (obviously not working at all!) and I know you are trying to help but this is just really not helpful.  (Just as an example - I don't have time or $$ for acupuncture.)  

So then I told my mom and she was like well next time you have to make sure you put in a couple of embryos.  And I'm like stop!  These are complicated medical decisions.  We make based on science and not rumors.  I know that some people are totally fine with twins but we aren't for many totally reasonable and rational reasons.  

When we tearfully told our inlaws what was going on, my mother in law, who is a medical doctor, said, 'well I think you need to relax!' and my father in law was like, 'that's it - doctors orders... Relax!!!'

All we want is for her to carry our child, a healthy child and bring it in to this world without complication.  She gets so frustrated, so depressed, when she sees girls getting pregnant where the baby's *father* leaves the second he finds out, or a girl is pregnant and she didn't even realize it.

/u/Passiflora15: Laparoscopic surgery to remove tubes and adhesions scheduled for Feb 24th.

/u/elcagey2: Appointment with Urologist for surgical plan for Husband on Feb 8th, and IVF Orientation Feb 29th. We are keeping the orientation booked, so that we can stay on the funding wait list in case the surgery does not improve counts.

/u/MBel312: Working out and saving money for an egg donor!


/u/daybeforetheday: Waiting for my period to arrive so I can start the Gonal-f injections. Stopped the pill on Sunday.

/u/linminimal: Gearing up for IVF#3. Meeting with the RE 2/17, tentative cycle start the beginning of March.

/u/puppypawsarecool: Waiting on insurance approval to start my first iui cycle with injectables.

/u/mmabpa: . I'm working out and losing weight, I will be checking in with the RE on March 1st to see if my weight is low enough to proceed with IVF. 

/u/ggmbb: So, cue up the more testing, more doctors appointments and possibly losing the figure I found underneath all the water retention and hormones.

/u/boizinha: We are waiting for this next appointment, in Wednesday. We hope the doctor will encourage us to do a iui.

<p><a href=""/u/elcagey2"">/u/elcagey2</a>: Appointment with Urologist for surgical plan for Husband on Feb 8th, and IVF Orientation Feb 29th. We are keeping the orientation booked, so that we can stay on the funding wait list in case the surgery does not improve counts.</p>

Here you have the option of posting the outcome of your cycle (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community.

For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread. 

For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on /r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, /r/InfertilityBabies.

Negative results are also welcome here, though they need not be confined to this thread. Members with questionable results who want immediate support, and those who need their follow-up questions to be open to greater and faster readership are, as always, welcome to post freely on the main board.
