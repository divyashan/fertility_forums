Super quick history on my infertility journey...I have done 5 rounds of IVF and one round of IVF with a surrogate, all of which have failed. My IVF rounds (after genetic testing) all ended in miscarriage before 5 weeks. After round 2 I found out I have a balanced translocation on chromosome 9 and 13 so I did genetic testing on all subsequent rounds. I also have PCOS and Hashimotos. 

Our IVF round with our surrogate just ended in miscarriage at about 6.5 weeks. She had a blighted ovum. I have read this can be correlated with chromosome 9. 

Questions:
- Is it possible that there could still be a problem on the genetic level that is not being detected in genetic testing since GT cane back normal? 

- is it possible that my prior IVF rounds could have also been blighted ovums, but we were not able to detect them because we did not have ultrasounds earlier than 6 weeks? 

- Does anyone know of any reproductive genetic experts or reproductive endocrinologists that specialize in genetics that could help me. No doctor seams to care about this as much as I do and I am looking for someone that can match my same eagerness to figure this out. 

- Has anyone had a similar experience with this?

43,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I'm a longtime lurker here, and thought I would introduce myself. My partner and I have struggled with infertility for over 4 years (40+ cycles with never a positive pregnancy test), and after various tests on both partners we were given a diagnosis of unexplained infertility. 

I've had an HSG and my tubes are clear, have regular 28-day cycles, ovulate every month, my hormone levels in follicular and luteral phase are normal, and my partner's sperm analysis looks outstanding. The only thing that has come up in all of our testing was an asymptomatic ureaplasma infection (confirmed in him, also expected to be present in me) that we treated using a course of doxycycline in summer 2018. Additionally, I have heavy, aching ovaries for 5-6 days of my follicular phase leading up to (painful) ovulation, however, neither my OB/GYN or my RE seems concerned by the pain.

Anyway, I started with my first cycle of IVF in late Oct. 2019, with ER#1 in early Nov. 2019 (20 retrieved, 12 mature, 12 fertilised via ICSI). Since I'm in Germany, I am subject to the Embryonenschutzgesetz or ""embryo protection law"". This means that the treatment protocols are quite different here than elsewhere. The law basically outlaws PGS/PGD testing, and also means you can't just grow a whole batch of eggs to the blast stage and then freeze them--the lab is only allowed to develop the number of embryos expected to be needed for the current transfer (with attrition). This meant for my fresh cycle only 4 were allowed to develop and the other 8 were frozen at the 2PN stage. 

During the fresh cycle, they transferred one perfect 8-cell day 3 embryo which failed to implant. Of the 3 still growing, 1 survived to blast stage (5AB) and was frozen on day 5. This was followed by a medicated day 5 FET the following month, for which the prep went very well and my lining looked great, but which also failed to implant. I had slightly low progesterone after the transfer (9), but brought it up with more medication.

I took a month off, and then started another medicated FET cycle, same protocol as the previous FET (with added progesterone), and again the prep looked good. This time they unfroze 4 2PN cells, and two made it to day 3 (one 6-cell and one 7-cell, moderate fragmentation -- I did not get grades, but would have graded them fair personally) and they transferred both on day 3. The other two arrested. I am currently waiting for my beta on this transfer, which is in 4 days. 

I'm optimistic, because part of me really wants this to work! But I'm also already thinking about what to do if it fails. It really frustrates me that the law here doesn't take into account the crushing emotions that come with failed transfers, and only takes into account the ""lives"" of the embryos. The success rates are only 25-30% per transfer in my age group due to the restrictions placed on the clinic by german law. I can't help but think that if I'd been at a clinic nearly anywhere else I would only be transferring good quality blasts and not fair day-3 cleavage stage embryos. 

Anyway, fingers crossed for this transfer, but I'll likely be back looking for advice on what to do/try next if this transfer fails.

The other two arrested. I am currently waiting for my beta on this transfer, which is in 4 days. </p>

<p>I&#39;m optimistic, because part of me really wants this to work! But I&#39;m also already thinking about what to do if it fails. It really frustrates me that the law here doesn&#39;t take into account the crushing emotions that come with failed transfers, and only takes into account the &quot;lives&quot; of the embryos. The success rates are only 25-30% per transfer in my age group due to the restrictions placed on the clinic by german law. I can&#39;t help but think that if I&#39;d been at a clinic nearly anywhere else I would only be transferring good quality blasts and not fair day-3 cleavage stage embryos. </p>

<p>Anyway, fingers crossed for this transfer, but I&#39;ll likely be back looking for advice on what to do/try next if this transfer fails. I know I haven&#39;t commented much, but I&#39;ve really appreciated all the knowledge and support of this community over the years.</p>

So my husband just had a successful mtese 2 weeks ago. He was diagnosed with non obstructive azoospermia (Age 31, FSH 11.3, LH 7.5, and testosterone 245, prolactin 17).

I have no female infertility issues that I know of but will be getting a saline ultrasound next week. I'm 29 and my AMH was 5 and my clinic seemed happy with that.

And I wanted to scream.

This isn't ""exciting"". I haven't felt ""excited"" about any part of this process, and every time I have allowed myself to feel even one shred of hope or excitement, there's been something waiting just around the corner to trample the shit out of it and leave it this bloody, mangled pulp. 

Last month, when I had a brief and fleeting positive pregnancy test, I decided I was going let myself feel just a little excited. I had spent so much of the last 4 years training myself into a sort of clinical numbness. It's the only way I could cope. Have zero expectations. Don't google baby names. Certainly don't fantasize or dream about what your future child would look like. Step away from the due date calculator and symptom-spotting websites! 

But for exactly 24 hours before my clinic called me to tell me it was a chemical pregnancy, I let myself go there, guys. I went full tilt excited. And I won't lie that for a brief moment it felt SO GOOD. I checked out maternity clothes online. I realized my due date was the same as my husband's birthday! Surely it was a sign! I started thinking more carefully about my food choices. I went so far into it, and invested so much into it, and got SO EXCITED that when I got the results back from my doctor I spent literally the entire weekend sobbing. I was surprised by how much it destroyed me. I can't even imagine what it's like to suffer a loss at a later stage. 

So, safe to say I. Am. Not. Excited. I'm scared. Scared it won't work. Scared I've made the wrong choice to proceed with a second attempt without further testing. Scared there is something really, really, really wrong with me. Scared I'll know again the high of having my first positive pregnancy test in 11 years, and then the low of knowing it's all over before it even began. I'm scared that I have only one embryo left if this doesn't work and it took me two retrievals and one entire year to make them - and I don't know that I'll be able to put myself through it again. I'm scared that I'll never be a parent. I'm scared to look into my husband's eyes and see expectation. You know who else got momentarily excited? Yeah, he was thrilled. I'm scared that, heck, this embryo might not even survive thaw! There are so many things to torture myself with, and so much uncertainty. This is fundamentally and on every single level the **LEAST** exciting thing I have ever done. 

Part of me actually feels like maybe I shouldn't transfer my remaining embryos. At least now, in their little frozen states, I can't lose them. They're safe, far from my uterus which I have to believe is just some sort of hostile, barren wasteland at this point that needs to be terraformed like Mars to be suitable for human life. 

But... like... Shouldn't the staff be trained not to say stupid shit like ""that's exciting!"" to me? Shouldn't they think to maybe look slightly longer at my chart and see I had an early loss less than a month ago? How on earth can they look at a woman sitting in a cold examination room, undressed from the waist down, preparing for her 100th twat wanding and think ""surely, this woman must be filled with excitement!""? What's worse is that this isn't the first time someone has said this to me at my clinic. It happens so regularly I'm wondering if it's some sort of bizarre staff policy. I understand when my mother or best friend says it, but I feel like the clinic staff should know better. They should KNOW BETTER. 

I'll tell you when I'll be excited: when I give birth to a live and healthy human being. That will be really fucking exciting. But until that moment comes, this is all terrifying and extraordinarily sad and I have never felt less excited in my entire life.",t2_2nr1and6,False,,0,False,"Rant: Please stop saying ""That's exciting!"" to me.

That&#39;s exciting!&quot;. </p>

<p>And I wanted to scream.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t &quot;exciting&quot;. I haven&#39;t felt &quot;excited&quot; about any part of this process, and every time I have allowed myself to feel even one shred of hope or excitement, there&#39;s been something waiting just around the corner to trample the shit out of it and leave it this bloody, mangled pulp. </p>

<p>Last month, when I had a brief and fleeting positive pregnancy test, I decided I was going let myself feel just a little excited. I had spent so much of the last 4 years training myself into a sort of clinical numbness. It&#39;s the only way I could cope. Have zero expectations. Don&#39;t google baby names. Certainly don&#39;t fantasize or dream about what your future child would look like. Step away from the due date calculator and symptom-spotting websites! </p>

<p>But for exactly 24 hours before my clinic called me to tell me it was a chemical pregnancy, I let myself go there, guys. I went full tilt excited. And I won&#39;t lie that for a brief moment it felt SO GOOD. I checked out maternity clothes online. I realized my due date was the same as my husband&#39;s birthday! Surely it was a sign! I started thinking more carefully about my food choices. I went so far into it, and invested so much into it, and got SO EXCITED that when I got the results back from my doctor I spent literally the entire weekend sobbing. I was surprised by how much it destroyed me. I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s like to suffer a loss at a later stage. </p>

<p>So, safe to say I. Am. Not. Excited. I&#39;m scared. Scared it won&#39;t work. Scared I&#39;ve made the wrong choice to proceed with a second attempt without further testing. Scared there is something really, really, really wrong with me. Scared I&#39;ll know again the high of having my first positive pregnancy test in 11 years, and then the low of knowing it&#39;s all over before it even began. I&#39;m scared that I have only one embryo left if this doesn&#39;t work and it took me two retrievals and one entire year to make them - and I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ll be able to put myself through it again. I&#39;m scared that I&#39;ll never be a parent. I&#39;m scared to look into my husband&#39;s eyes and see expectation. You know who else got momentarily excited? Yeah, he was thrilled. I&#39;m scared that, heck, this embryo might not even survive thaw! There are so many things to torture myself with, and so much uncertainty. This is fundamentally and on every single level the <strong>LEAST</strong> exciting thing I have ever done. </p>

I was pretty active on this sub a while ago.. not sure if people remember me, you always hope people get to leave this sub. 

It has been a while.. we have done a total of 10 ICSI treatments and I just feel tired all the time! Our last cycle of 2019 was supposed to give us some answers because we would do a 50/50 cycle with donorsperm and my husbands sperm. However our hospital really screwed up. Lots of (last-minute) changes in my treatment plan, including pushing the retrieval till monday. So I go in on monday to find out my ovaries are swollen and full of fluid, so I should cancel the rest of the cycle. Huge disappointment, but also this felt unnessecary. I think the main reason was that they did the retrieval too late (should have been saturday), but also because they just the standard trigger pregnyl (where before I have use decapeptyl, which worked fine). I was so mad and sad at the same time!

But ofcourse, we keep going because there is not much else we can do! So we made a new appointment with a different clinic (our old docters actually switched so we really regretted not leaving with them before.. only reason we didn’t was that they don’t have any spermbank yet). We had our talk with the docter and can start treatment next month (somewhere in march). I just started to feel okay a bit and then last wednesday one of my best friends told me she is pregnant. I felt like everything collapsed.. since then I have had so many crying moments!

She knows about our situation and we are really close, so she was crying too when she told me. We had this discussion about a year before ‘what would happen if..’. But I guess we both hoped I’d be pregnant first. This whole situation is so unfair! And I really hate myself for not just being happy for her. I just read a post here about someone being real close to another friend that gets pregnant and wanting to help her. I just wish this wasn’t happening, and I feel like shit because of the way I feel. I also struggle to look into the future, what will this do to our friendship? Can I still go to her and cry if this fails? Should I keep my distance to protect myself? Should I act like nothing changed.. even when we both now it did? I have no clue how to handle this.

It has been a long road for us and I am just so, so tired. I tagged this post as emotional support because I could really use some now.. we have a cycle planned in march and we decided this will be our last try. We will use up any embryo’s we get. This time we use some extra medication for me because they found out I had too many natural killer cells in my uturus, so let’s hope this is the small change that makes it work. I really want to stay positive, but I also don’t want to get my hopes up. Right now I can continue untill april, but what about our future? How can I continue after that? I am not even sure I want to.. 

I am sorry for rambling, but I just needed someone to really get this and I just have nowhere else to turn too.. I have tried therapy, but it didn’t work out the way I hoped.

My husband and I have been TTC for over a year. Yesterday after a second SA, it was confirmed he has azoospermia. 

While trying to wrap my head around that diagnosis, his other doctor called (literally 45 minutes later) letting us know his liver enzymes were dangerously high. That’s when my husband decided to come clean that he’s been struggling with alcohol for the past two years. He’s convinced his lack of sperm is due to his drinking and has decided to check himself into rehab this weekend. I guess he had been thinking about getting help for awhile and these test results were the final straw. 

To say I’m in shock is an understatement. I knew he drank but never in a million years thought it was this bad. Obviously I’m SO proud of him. He was strong enough to recognize his disease and is proactively seeking help. He’s a warrior in that aspect. But as he’s sitting here researching rehab clinics, I’m still wondering what the fuck just happened. 

The guilt I’m feeling right now is almost unbearable. I have been so determined to have a baby I didn’t see the warning signs. I let it become all-consuming. The pressure of TTC has lead us here and most of this is my fault.

I also have guilt because I can’t stop thinking about the azoospermia diagnosis and what this means for our TTC future. Will he still want a baby when he gets out? Will his sperm ever recover? Would he be open to a donor? I hate myself for having these thoughts. 

So for now our TTC journey is being put on hold. I’m not sure what the future holds but I hope I get to come back someday. Thanks for being a shoulder to cry on.

I just never felt comfortable enough to post. My husband (31M) and I (28F) have been trying since November 2017. I've been diagnosed with PCOS (high AMH, but no insulin resistance) and am slightly overweight (BMI 30). My TSH was 2.5, so I've been on synthoid which has my levels down to 2.3. My husband is healthy, but SA came back with 0-2% morphology. Everything else looked good.

I take: prenatal vitamins, omega-3 fish oil, magnesium (for migraines), cranberry supplement (for UTIs), 600mg of co-q10, 2000 ius of vitamin D, and synthoid to lower TSH. Husband takes: men's multivitamin, 1000ius vitamin D, 200mg co-q10.

We tried with timed intercourse. I temped/used opks and was able to confirm ovulation, but it was sometimes delayed. Cycles ranged from 30-45 days.

My obgyn did an unmonitored Clomid cycle which resulted in a late ovulation. I've had multiple day 3 bloodworks done. My HSG was normal. We both did genetic testing and we are not carriers. We moved to an RE in August of 2019. We did 1 timed cycle on letrozole and 3 IUIs with 5.0 of letrozole and an ovidrel trigger shot. Always 1-2 great follicles, great sperm numbers (aside from morph) and nothing.

I was reassured that everything looked great on paper. They were mostly concerned with my delayed ovulation. I pushed about my husband's poor morphology, but was told all of his other numbers looked great... So no need to worry. I made them test his hormone levels and they were fine.

We decided to move to IVF in January 2020. Primed with BCP for 10 days.  I responded great to the antagonist protocol (gonal/menopur with ganirelix added later). I stimmed for 9 days. I had 35 (!!) follicles between 14-24 mm day before retrieval. Triggered with Lurpon (2/3 PM and 2/4 AM). We got 32 oocytes retrieved with 29 mature. 25 fertilized with ICSI. I was pretty sick after retrieval with mild internal bleeding that resolved about 4 days later. 

Just got the news yesterday (7 days post retrieval) that only 3 survived. 21 of them didn't survive to day 5. We lost another on day 5. We have 3 that were frozen, biopsied and sent off for testing... We'll hear results in 2 weeks. I'm waiting for a better report on what happened from my RE. I was too upset to remember what she said for the rest of the call. I was expecting a drop off in numbers... But this much of a drop off was shocking. The RE confirmed that she was also very surprised.

I'm devastated. I should be happy with 3... But I don't have high hopes considering they barely made it. I'm worried they'll come back abnormal. Or I'm worried they won't thaw well. I'm worried that they will not implant or will not result in a sustainable/healthy pregnancy. I'm worried about my mental health in trying to transfer these and they won't work. I'm worried about time...

I'm pissed that no one listened to me that there was a sperm issue. I was told to stop googling and worrying about things that didn't matter yet. But here we are...  They all failed after day 3... So I'm guessing sperm is obviously a huge issue here. I'm pushing for a visit with the urologist on staff at my RE. I'm pushing harder for DNA frag testing now. Wondering if we just jump straight to TESE and just assume that DNA frag is high and the issue. All these questions I have to figure out answers to. I'm pushing for all the things I should have put my foot down on before we wasted $20k. I'm so angry. We can't keep throwing money at this... We have to make a decision on when we call it on biological children/any children at all. It all seems so unfair.

Apologies for the novel. Thank you for reading this far! I've searched through this sub for advice often and am so glad it's here!  I'm not sure what the purpose of this was... I guess it feels good to write it out? I just feel lost. And devastated. And tired. And angry. I'm so fucking tired and angry. Is there any other testing I need to push for?

Bit of background on me - 34, have been trying for 2 years now. We had a chemical pregnancy on our first try, and nothing since then. Well, except for the myriad of diagnoses I've collected since then! I now have Hashimoto's, hypothyroidism, PCOS and am borderline insulin resistant. 

I have periods every month, but my cycle can vary between 25-40+ days, and I usually ovulate late, with a 12 day luteal phase. I track using BBT and ovulation sticks, and have always been able to confirm ovulation this way. I usually have one day (first) of my period that is intensely painful so I suspect endometriosis.

I did two cycles of Clomid a while ago (50mg and then 100mg), and had a terrible reaction on the higher dose (side effects galore) so dr switched to letrozole. I am in the middle of my 3rd letrozole cycle - so overall 4 completed medicated cycles with no success.

Today was my meeting with the specialist to discuss next steps. He said for my situation he'd go either two ways:

1) laparoscopy to check tubes are clear, check for endometriosis and remove if any. This will apparently give us 5 months or so of slightly improved fertility odds IF I do have endo. 

2) go straight to IVF. He said he uses a 'long down reg protocol' for his patients, and that yes, I may end up with OHSS due to PCOS. He only operates/does IVF in my town during certain months - he's here in late March and then late May, so those are when I'd be able to do it.

If we went IVF and wanted to do it asap, we'd have to let him know like tomorrow to get into his March appointments, and I'm guessing it would mean starting medications now-ish.

We could also wait until May, but... Being at this for 2 years, waiting longer seems excruciating. But sensible?? 

I am open to any and all feedback or opinions. I know I have a lot of reading and learning to do about IVF but... should I just go for it? If I'm ending up having some kind of surgery either way (laparoscopy or egg retrieval/transfer)?

The first appointment went wonderful, and we decided to move forward with IUI. We’ve been ecstatic and hopeful and happy since the first appointment. I’ve been started on some medications and been sent some injections and a couple other little things, we have appointments scheduled galore this month. The last couple of days I’ve been feeling REALLY down about everything. I’m not religious at all, but I’ve always been a VERY firm believer that everything happens for a reason. This is something I’ve been struggling with HARD lately, whereas I was always able to push it out of my mind before as a silly thought. I’m having a hard time doing that recently.

After a year of trying in December of 2018 we decided to seek testing/treatment and spontaneously got pregnant. This ended in a miscarriage January of 2019. April we did IUI and again - pregnant, however that was chemical and our second loss. We followed this with IVF wanting to see if there was an egg quality issue because everything else was normal. We did the retrieval and ended up with 3 normal blasts (two 6 day and one 7 day). We did a mock cycle, then transferred one which didn’t implant. We switched RE’s in November 2019 and did another IUI in December. This resulted in a pregnancy with twins, however one never developed a heartbeat. At my 10+3 ultrasound  last Tuesday I graduated from the RE, but he saw an abnormality on the ultrasound, like another mass inside the sac but not attached to the baby. I sent the scans to the OB who referred me to a perinatologist and told me they got the NIPT back and it’s a girl. I have always always wanted a little girl. I went to the perinatologist Friday at 10+6 and he said it was a neural tube defect. The top of the skull never formed, so the additional mass seen on the ultrasound is brain matter. He said to follow up with the OB Monday for a D&C. This has been the saddest four days. I can hardly get out of bed, I have a chronic headache from sobbing all the time and I have so many questions. It turns out my OB is out of town this week so they want me to wait until next week for the D&C. But she is still in there and she is still moving around and growing.  How can this go on for another week? Not to mention I am just a basket case because I’m not ready to lose her even though I basically already have.

I'm a journalist by trade and a writer by soul, so I've long known how words can make us *feel* things and connect us. That open letter, ""Dear Infertility,"" though... It reminded me all over again. It made me want to share this letter I wrote back in 2017. A little different—okay, a lot different I guess—than ""Dear Infertility,"" but maybe some of you will appreciate it, albeit in a different way than my own sentiments.

**Who you'll be**

Dear Baby,

I should start by introducing myself. My name is Halei, but one day, you’ll know me as Mom. At least, I pray you will. Your dad and I have been on a journey to have you for quite a while now. It’s been a crazy, emotional rollercoaster. Some days are great, and others like tonight… Well, they’re not so great.

You see, Mom’s been having a really hard time. God is making me wait for you, and I don’t like it. Not one bit. I’m not very patient. Hopefully, that’s a trait you’ll get from your daddy.

Which leads me to wonder who you’ll be. Will you have my hair? Or will it be just as blonde as your dad’s? Will you have my height? I hope not… There’s nothing worse than short jokes. What about my eyes? I guess I can answer that myself, seeing as your dad and I both have blue eyes.

Will you love sports like me, or will you be a complete girly-girl that I’ll be clueless what to do with? Or will you be a daddy’s boy that I have to beg to take your muddy clothes off at the door and not track dirt all through my house?

Will you be calm and collected under pressure, or will you crack? It doesn’t matter, but I just wonder. Will you be funny like your dad, always with a quip at the ready? Will you go the extra mile to help your fellow man just because? Oh, I certainly hope so. There are so many things I love about your daddy, and that’s just one of them.

Will you be habitually late like me? Will you have a hot temper like your dad, or will you be shy and reserved? Will you be goofy? I wonder what your smile will look like. Will you have my family’s chubby cheeks? Will you love to swim, and will you love animals? Will you be a hard worker like both of your grandpas?

Will you look good in yellow, or will red be more your color? Will you have naturally tan skin like your daddy and your nana? Will you be super picky about your clothes, and will you love vegetables like me?

Baby, will you be good at math, or will the arts be your strong suit? Either way, I’ll try my best. Will you be overly competitive like your dad? Will you love or hate breakfast? Specifically, I want to know if you’ll eat cereal out of a storage bowl rather than a regular bowl. That’s your dad’s favorite, and while it makes for an easy night in the kitchen, it makes it hard to keep milk in the fridge. And yes, I promise not to get aggravated if you leave just enough milk to piss me off, though I can’t say the same when your dad does it.

Will I have to beg you to get out of bed every morning because there’s nothing worse than waking up before 8 a.m.? If so, I take the blame; I hate mornings, too. Will you like your sugar with a little coffee, or will you take it black? Will you be tenderhearted like your oldest cousin? Will you ring the clothes hamper, or will I have to move it to the spot where your clothes erroneously land, only to move the hamper twice more in the same week?

Will you love Harry Potter and Star Wars and all things nerd? Will you love to read? Will you be like me and crawl into Mom and Dad’s bed at three in the morning, even when you’re 12-years-old, just because you watched a scary movie two years ago and you’ve suddenly had a bad dream, or will you be Mr. Tough Guy and not need us at all? Will you be a Hufflepuff or a Ravenclaw? Will you be a thrill-seeker like your daddy? Will you fall in love easily like me, and, if you’re a girl, will you listen when I tell you that boys are stupid until they’re at least 23? Will you be hardheaded like your dad, and will you be as ambitious as me?

Will we have anything in common? Will you love me? Will I be a good mom? All I’ve heard for years is how “Halei won’t know what to do with a kid,” which has kind of put some serious doubts in my mind, so while you’re still with God, please ask Him to work on me today and all the tomorrows I have to wait through so that when He does give you to me, I’ll be ready, no matter who you are.

I miss you. Sometimes, I feel empty inside without you. I’ve got your name picked out. Your dad hasn’t agreed just yet, but that’s okay. He’ll come around. I’ve got your nursery planned out. You’ll come to know this one day, but it’s not normal to plan your own baby shower. However, Mom’s had too much spare time on her hands, and I’ve already done that, too.

Which makes me wonder, will you be a planner like me, or will you do things on a whim like your dad? Will you be organized and neat? Will you keep your promises? Will you take my word when I tell you I won’t be mad if you drink, so long as you call me for a ride home to avoid driving? Will you be forgiving and loving and passionate? Those are all traits that your dad and I both have, so I feel sure you will be, but I just don’t know.

That’s what hurts the most, I think. I don’t know who you’ll be, and because of that, I wonder all the time.

You see, your daddy and I, we’ve had some pretty tough times. We fell in love so early in life. I was only 18 when I met him, and he was only 20. We married a year and some odd months later. We thought we had it figured out. Then, the next two years were rough… We still have some bad days, but, like a lot of other things I’ve said already, you’ll someday come to understand that’s normal.

But now we’re ready. We have a place of our own, righted our finances well enough to support you, and, most importantly, we’ve learned to love each other—*truly* love each other. We’re happy, but there’s something missing… It’s you.

It seems like everybody Mommy and Daddy are friends with has moved on with their lives. Right now as I pen this letter, we’re still young. I’m only 24. Your dad is 27. Still, every one of Mommy’s friends has a you. They have their babies. They don’t have to wonder who their children will be because they know them because they *have* them. I don’t, no, *we* don’t have you… And it hurts. We miss you, and I want you to know that whenever you get here, be it nine months from today or nine years from today, I’ll love you all the more for having been made to wait. I can’t wait to know who you are, inside and out.

156,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I value the insight of this board so much and I could really use some help.  I just got the news that we had no blasts from our second IVF (we froze one day 3 embryo (8 cell, grade one) but of course I have no confident about that turning into a pregnancy).  I’m just not sure what to next and am feeling totally defeated.

About me: 33 years old, AMH 2.16 (but it has been as low as 1.71), FSH 7.7,  AFC 15-17, well controlled type 1 diabetes, hashimotos with normal TSH, and microprolactinoma treated with cabergoline ( this is what got me sent to the RE in the first place because it made me lose my period).

No known male factor issues, but also no DNA frag test

Pre-IVF— started with just progesterone for 6 cycles because I have a short luteal phase.  Then did 6 cycles of letrozole (4 with timed intercourse, 2 with IUI ). No successes.

IVF #1– bcp pills for 11 days,  started with 150 menopur, 75 Gonal.  After  3 days we moved to 225 menopur, 75 Gonal.  Added cetrotide at some point, I forget when.  Stimmed for 12 days. There were 10 follicles on the day of trigger (250 ovidrel) (later found my estrogen at this point was 1400 and progestorone was 1.4).

Retrieved 7 eggs,  5 were mature, 3 fertilized with ICSI and three growing on day 3, all grade 1 (two 8 cells and one 11 cell).  We did a day 3 fresh transfer of the best embryo and the rest were left to culture.  I got pregnant, but miscarried at 5w5d.  One of the other embryos arrested later on day 3, the other made it to early blast on day 7, but it had too few cells and was discarded.

After the first round my doctor said bcp oversuppressed me and I need more stims for the next round. She also said we would try for a frozen transfer because my progesterone was a bit high.  I think she also said my LH (I think?)was high so we would try menopur only (not sure about what was high though, but there was some rational for dumping gonal)

IVF #2– Estrogen priming (2mg estrace daily starting after ovulation and then orilissa starting on day 4 of estrace (should be started a week after, but bumped up because of my luteal phase being short).

After I got my period I kept up the estrace and orilissa. Had a baseline on day 4, kept taking orilissa for 4 more days, but no estrogen, and then started stims.

We did 375 menopur this time around.  Added cetrotide on day 5 (estrogen was around 500).  On day 7 estrogen was 1117 and I had 6 follicles between 13-15 and 10 between 10-11.   They told me not to come back and to trigger in two days (so only stimming for 8 days).  I triggered again with ovidrel.  

We again retrieved 7 eggs, 5 were mature, 4 fertilized with ICSI, 4 were growing on day 3, all grade 1 ( an 8 cell, 2 10 cells, and a 14 cell).  We decided to freeze the 8 cell at day 3.  We let the rest grow.  We found out today that all three arrested on day 4.

Originally we had planned to bank for potentially two children, but I’m seriously reassessing that now.  We fortunately have the money for a few more rounds, but I honestly don’t know how much more of this I can personally take.

Our next steps— we have a follow up with my doctor next week who said on day 3 “I like this protocol for you” and who I think just wanted us to roll right into another EP menopur cycle, but I was like no we have to discuss (also fuck her because after our miscarriage she was like “this will work for you... I’m very honest if I think this won’t work for people”).  We also have one other consultation scheduled and I will be scheduling a couple more.  

In preparation for all this, can anyone give me any insight into what protocol changes we could try (doctor suggested maybe a flare option)? Could we modify the estrogen priming to sync of the follicles more since we seemed to have that larger cohort we left behind? Can we change the trigger to get more mature eggs?

We’ve been told the issue is the number of eggs we are retrieving, not the subsequent outcomes, but is there something there? Do we need to look more deeply at my husbands sperm?

Or should we start thinking about donor eggs?

<p>After I got my period I kept up the estrace and orilissa. Had a baseline on day 4, kept taking orilissa for 4 more days, but no estrogen, and then started stims.</p>

<p>We did 375 menopur this time around.  Added cetrotide on day 5 (estrogen was around 500).  On day 7 estrogen was 1117 and I had 6 follicles between 13-15 and 10 between 10-11.   They told me not to come back and to trigger in two days (so only stimming for 8 days).  I triggered again with ovidrel.  </p>

<p>We again retrieved 7 eggs, 5 were mature, 4 fertilized with ICSI, 4 were growing on day 3, all grade 1 ( an 8 cell, 2 10 cells, and a 14 cell).  We decided to freeze the 8 cell at day 3.  We let the rest grow.  We found out today that all three arrested on day 4.</p>

<p>Originally we had planned to bank for potentially two children, but I’m seriously reassessing that now.  We fortunately have the money for a few more rounds, but I honestly don’t know how much more of this I can personally take.</p>

<p>Our next steps— we have a follow up with my doctor next week who said on day 3 “I like this protocol for you” and who I think just wanted us to roll right into another EP menopur cycle, but I was like no we have to discuss (also fuck her because after our miscarriage she was like “this will work for you... I’m very honest if I think this won’t work for people”).  We also have one other consultation scheduled and I will be scheduling a couple more.  </p>

<p>In preparation for all this, can anyone give me any insight into what protocol changes we could try (doctor suggested maybe a flare option)? Could we modify the estrogen priming to sync of the follicles more since we seemed to have that larger cohort we left behind? Can we change the trigger to get more mature eggs?</p>

<p>We’ve been told the issue is the number of eggs we are retrieving, not the subsequent outcomes, but is there something there? Do we need to look more deeply at my husbands sperm?</p>

<p>Or should we start thinking about donor eggs?</p>

<p>I really appreciate all the support on this board and am hoping I can get some wisdom from you all.</p>

If you’d asked me a few years ago, I’d have figured it wasn’t possible for me and written it off.  What changed that?  Settle in for a long story.

First, I spent many many years single after bad relationships and trying to survive financially after fleeing my abusive family.  (I won’t go into details but they’re all horrible people who are no longer in my life)

There was this guy I had a crush on at 31 or so but he politely declined me.  (Spoiler Alert:  this turned out to be Mr. Drownedlily, but this happens much later) 

So I’m single, I’m trying to make the best of it, I’m traveling, then I get sick.  I mean really sick at 35.  I spend months going to doctor after doctor until they finally find that I have pituitary adenoma and Cushing’s Disease.  

I go through neurosurgery, let me tell you that was not easy and it took a good year and a half to fully recover from it because my hormones were all over the place. 

During this recovery I turn 36 and the guy I liked 5 years ago starts to flirt with me.  We end up dating and I fall absolutely in love.   I explain to him early on that because of my age and medical history a pregnancy might not be possible.  

We make plans to move in together, we get a little careless with birth control.  Next thing I know I’m 8 weeks pregnant and absolutely shocked.   I just get over the shock and I’m overjoyed.  We’re obviously heading toward marriage and yeah, this might not be the best timing for a baby but so what?  

Four days later I miscarry.  

To say, I dealt with depression after that is an understatement.   We get engaged and start planning a wedding and figure we’ll put trying on hold until the honeymoon.  

We got married in May 2019.  I found out I was pregnant again on July 4th.  I’m ecstatic.   I’m the most crazy cautious pregnant woman you can think of.  I’m doing everything to make sure this little one I get to hold.  In August at 9 weeks, I miscarry again.  

We’re both devastated.  The testing turns up that our son had trisomy 11.   We start going through genetic testing and going to an RE. 

In December it comes back that my AMH is .6, I have a blocked left Fallopian tube, a uterine polyp and a mild uterine septum.  A plan is developed start stims, make embryos, PGD, freeze all, surgery then implantation.  

It’s a long road, it seems overwhelming but I’m ready.  I dream of our baby every night.   Will he/she have my eyes, my husband’s smile? 

Our first round of stims ends up with 3 mature eggs.  2 fertilize.  Both die by day 5.  We’re crushed but looking to try again.  We thankfully have insurance to cover a lot of the costs but they take their sweet time approving cycles.  Meaning I won’t be approved until my March cycle now - when our son was due (March 11th to be exact).

Funnily, I said I didn’t want to do IVF a few years ago, but after two miscarriages (both time we saw a heartbeat), I’ll do whatever to not go through that kind of loss again. 

In our case, there’s not much else we could’ve done.  We’re still newlyweds, even though we knew each other then trying 8 years ago wouldn’t have worked.  Considering how severe my Cushing’s was I probably couldn’t have frozen eggs since Cushing’s is a no go for stims (the tests and clearances I needed to be approved NOW were intense).  Also I would usually have very irregular cycles. 

So here I am, closer to 40 than 39 and trying to figure out why the hell yet another thing in my life has to be hard and if I’d be willing to put myself through a pregnancy of a baby that’s not genetically mine if this all fails.  (My husband of course is fine.  He has plenty of sperm we can use).

It feels so unfair, I had an illness I didn’t cause that made my life hell (and took six months of aggressive doctors visits to get diagnosed) and I survive that and then I get teased with the idea of having a baby.  It’s cruel.   If I hadn’t been able to get pregnant I wouldn’t be chasing a baby that some days seems further and further away. 

I feel like Cinderella and the clock is striking midnight.  “NOW! NOW! NOW!” Or you’ll never have a baby.

169,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Dear Infertility, 

This letter has been long overdue. It’s time I finally sat down and confronted you. I used to think you were a quick phase that would go away. If we took a few meds and a few supplements we would be good to go in no time. So we would have to wait a few extra months, that’s ok, it will make the prize even sweeter. 

But as the months go by I’m starting to realize you’re not a quick phase. You’re a chapter that will have a significant impact on my life. As I turn every corner now I see you, not just in pregnancy announcements and shower invites, but in every child’s face. 

You have robbed me of the experience of happily celebrating a positive pregnancy test in the privacy of my own home. You’ve subjected me to invasive and sometimes painful procedures and tests. I’ve never shown so many strangers my vagina. You’ve taken away the intimacy of conceiving a child in my own bed. And you have forever changed the way I view sex. 

Every phase with you I’m challenged with new thoughts and feelings. Maybe I don’t even like kids? Sleepless nights with a crying baby sound awful. Actually these sleepless nights without a kid are pretty awful..I guess this just wasn’t in the cards for me. How do I picture spending the rest of my life childless? ...Maybe this won’t be so bad after all, it will be easier to continue to keep my body in shape as I get older. You can bounce quarters off my ass from now until 90. 

I have so much fight in me for so many things that I wish this was a letter of how I braved these new challenges and conquered you because I am a woman and a warrior. But really this is just a letter of how much I fucking hate you. You’re a beast I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. And you’re wearing me down.

Take a break they say. A break, good idea, let’s drag this out even longer. Let’s turn a year and a half into two and half years. At this age, I’m no longer told “Ah, you’ve got time” when I tell my patients no, I don’t have kids. I’m now given a pleasant reminder of their friends and relatives that also chose not to have kids. “My nephew and his wife travel instead” Thanks Karen, except I never said I didn’t want kids, I just said I don’t have them. 

Oh wait I almost forgot my favorite part of this. I decided a long time ago I would stay one step ahead of you and openly answer the question “So when are you and Rick going to have kids?” Well, “we are being treated for infertility” Sometimes I get a chuckle when I see their face go pale with embarrassment. It’s funny to watch them trip over sentences to offer up some kind of unsolicited advice or support. Good luck this is a touchy subject I think in my head as I watch them fumble around for words.

What’s not funny is when they tell me not to stress over it. Just relax and let nature take its course. Ok Nancy, we all took the same sex ed course and that’s not how biology works. And who said I was stressed? I just answered your question honestly and yea I eat a lot of chocolate so what? And yea alcohol is starting to look appealing. 

Stress pssssh this isn’t stress honey, nope, it’s a walk in the park. I sped through rush hour traffic with my husbands sperm in a cup between my legs without breaking a bead of sweat. Did you know you have to produce it and get it there within an hour? We live 20 minutes away and it’s time for the morning rush. Tick tock. Ask me about stress again.

I try to find humor through this in the most unusual places. Sometimes I picture myself cat walking through the lobby with the cup of sperm in my hand. Right here ladies, holding it up proudly, fresh off the press!  ...Maybe asking the doctor if he likes my pedicure. Which color would you like to see next month? Who is the probe today doc? Brad Pitt?

Infertility I just want to know, why the fuck are you here? Did you see me finally hitting my stride and decide there’s a girl who could use a shake up. While cracking your knuckles you said “let’s show this girl what we are made of.” God I hate you. 

I’d like to close this letter but I can’t. Because you’re here to stick around. It’s just the three of us. Arm and arm for a while longer. Like the three amigos.

I just had an egg retrieval 3 days ago. 5 fertilized and currently waiting how many make it to Day 5 embryos. We want to have 3 kids total and are afraid 5 fertilized isn’t enough to work with. To keep costs lower we have decided if moving towards another egg retrieval that we will PGS test all together and not just from this cycle to prevent paying for testing twice. Because of this we need to make the decision tomorrow (1 day before hearing the day 5 results) if we will be prepping for another egg retrieval or a FET. Should we send off the ones that make it to Day 5 for PGS testing and prep for a FET or should we move forward  with another egg retrieval? Seems like a lot to go through to potentially need only 1-2 more genetically normal embryos. But I also don’t want to regret in 10 years not doing so.

I’ve went to 3 RE’s over the past 4 months and each has given my vastly different AFC’s that has me wondering what the real # is? My AMH is .2, for reference.

Here are the counts:

Doctor #1 ,Aug 2019 - counted 4 total between two ovaries. 

Doctor #2, Nov 2019-Jan 2020 - counted 5-8 over a course of 6 ultrasounds 

Doctor #3, Jan 2020 - Feb 2020 - counted 2-3 over a course of 3 ultrasounds 


Note: Doctor #2’s ultrasound monitor seemed to be a super zoom in of each ovary vs Doctors #1 and #3. Doctors #1 & #3’s showed each ovary taking up about 20% of the screen vs. Doctor #2’s which showed the ovary as about 50% of the screen. I’m wondering if that makes a difference?

Another doctor I consulted with (with no ultrasounds done)  had an issue with the AFC #s of Doctor #2 saying that my AMH indicated much lower AFC’s than the 7-8 she was typically counting.

189,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"To all the people who saw my very long post last month this is a follow-up to that post.

We got many great suggestions on things to try and we followed up on 3 of them - Laparo/Hystero, DNA frag, and Ferritin.

We are still waiting on the results for the DNA frag test.

I had a Laparo/Hystero yesterday, and despite having no signs or symptoms, they found 3-4 small spots (it looked kinda like freckles on the images they gave me) of endo that they removed.

My iron/Ferritin results came back showing that I have severe iron deficiency anemia. I am being referred to a hematologist to work on getting that fixed. The earliest I could get in for our consult is 2/19, so a little bit of a wait. They are thinking I may need infusions to get my levels back up quicker. RE said he won't proceed with another transfer until we get the iron fixed, but they also said they can't say if the anemia had an affect on my miscarriage history or not (which was kind of frustrating since it the first abnormal result we have gotten in 2.5 years). But considering how important iron and oxygen (anemia leads to decreased oxygen in the blood) are to pregnancy, I'm hoping fixing this will give us a much better chance at keeping a pregnancy. Iron and oxygen are very important during weeks 6-8 since that's when blood supply increases and development ramps up, and coincidentally (or not) all our losses have been during week 6. So my theory is every time my blood supply increased it pushed my iron even lower and made it impossible for the baby to survive due to lack of iron and oxygen - this is just my personal theory, but I feel like it has some logic behind it.

They also ran my vitamin B12 and D3 while they were at it, just to cover more ground. B12 came back normal, but D3 was a tad low.

So all in all so far - we identified 3 problems that are all treatable and have plans to fix them. The endo has already been taken care of, I have been put on otc D3 suppliment (5000 iu), and will be seeing a hematologist to get my anemia taken care of. And we will wait patiently for our DNA frag results.

I just want to say a HUGE thank you to everyone who commented on my last post with suggestions! Your thoughts and ideas have really helped us to finally find some issues! It sounds crazy but when I got my iron results and found out they found endo (even if it wasn't much) I cried. I cried because it was such a relief to finally get test results that weren't normal - we finally found something wrong!!! Big shout out to the people who suggested the silent endo (there were a couple of you) and to the wonderful @derpy_deerhound who suggested the Ferritin testing (we would have never thought of that, especially after being a long term blood donor with no history of low iron or anemia (I was tested twice when I was younger))!

This is my first time posting here after lurking for some time. My husband and I have been TTC for the past 2 1/2 years. We've had 2 chemical pregnancies (naturally) and 2 chemical pregnancies back-to-back after our FETs.

We checked our immunology, chromosomes, prolactin, TSH, natural killer cells, HSG and all were normal.  I was diagnosed with mild PCOS and he has a high DNA fragmentation. We recently did the ERA and it showed we're transferring on the correct day (day 21 of Estrace).  
However, WE FINALLY got some kind of an answer 2 weeks ago. I tested +BCL6 through the ReceptivaDx. We decided (along with our doctor) to do a micro-laparoscopy. He ended up finding stage 1 mild endo and resecting it. He also did a tubal lavage and hysteroscopy which was totally clear.

We're prepping for our next FET in March. We have 2 more frozen embryos (we had a total of 4 frozen after our IVF cycle, but lost the 2 to chemicals). We did not do PGS testing due to our age and overall good health (I'm 28, husband is 33). Our doctor only plans on transferring 1 embryo at a time. I'm concerned about the 2 embryos left, because we had 28 eggs retrieved and only ended up with 4 making it to blast (we couldn't do a fresh transfer because I developed OHSS--which was HELL on earth).

This whole week I've been struggling and I feel like it finally hit my husband today--we're both in a funk. It's hard not to let the negative thoughts come in of it not working, I feel like I'm researching for hours every evening. I know it won't help, but it gives me some sort of control. I was honestly hoping for the ERA to also show we were transferring the wrong day that way there'd be 2 things to fix.

I am looking for some advice as going through IUI a couple of days back brought up some very difficult emotions for me.
I am 36 and my husband is 40. We have been TTCing for two years without even a single positive pregnancy test. 
We went to fertility clinic and the specialists concern was my age and my husband's poor sperm morphology (1%). All other counts in S.A. was normal. So the doctor suggested three cycles of IUI. If that doesn't work, the move to IVF with ICSI. I had my first IUI on Tuesday followed by a second insemination on Wednesday. 

I  was very emotional and sad and lot of bad memories and guilt came to surface that morning. I have a mild form of congenital ichtyosis  vulgaris which is a cosmetic problem for me. It doesn't impact my da to day life. I have found solutions that work reasonably well. But I suffered a lot during my adolescent years. I was constantly depressed, scares, isolated and what not. It has shaped me into what I am today and not in a good way. The possibility of passing this to my child always bothered me and is one of the reason I didn't try to have a baby till 34. By that time, this disorder had bevome was more like a fading scar than an open wound. So I felt confident to try for a baby. Somehow seeing the egg in ultrasound and the timing of insemination made me feel the possibility of pregnancy  very real. I instantly felt guilty of prioritizing me being a mother more than the wellbeing of the child. I felt guilty for putting my husband in a situation where he may have to deal with  a child with this problem. All painful memories dealinb with this disorder came back. I wept in the car all the way home and throughout the night as well as yesterday.

After recovering a bit, I started researching to see if there is a possibility of making sure that my child doesn't have this problem. I saw there is a test for single gene mutation for my case of ichtyosis as well as a full panel tests for other gene mutations in that family of disorders. I want to get tested to confirm the mutation and do IVF-ICSI with PGT-M. I was looking if some one here has done this and how they went about it. I have also written to igenomix  and another company asking ow to go about this.

I have left a message with my fertility clinic if they can write me a test for this. The company I saw which tests for this mutation is fulgent genetics. It will be very helpful for me if any one has used this company's services and can share their experience. 

I wish All of you very best and thank you in advance.

We have not tested for DNA frag but one of the main reasons I chose this clinic was because my RE told me he uses the Zymot so I assumed he believed in DNA frag.

The embryologist said he doesn’t but agreed to use the Zymot (half with Zymot and half with his choice) during our last ER (#3).  He told me that he usually just picks the best looking sperm.  They obviously used it incorrectly because they said all the sperm they put in it came out dead.  They said it’s not the first time it’s happened either. **we sent 4 or 5 embryos off for pgs testing.  1 was normal.  1 abnormal was linked to paternal side, 1 was linked to maternal side.  They could pin point the source of the other abnormals.  I believe that if the Zymot was used correctly, we’d have had a better chance of getting more normals. But it’s hard to explain my reasoning to a scientist 🤦🏻‍♀️)

But here are my main questions I’m hoping you can help me with.  

**can DNA frag be spotted on the microscope?**

Well, shit...I’m drawing a blank right now.  But regardless, I want him to use the Zymot this time CORRECTLY on some sperm.   

Any thoughts or studies you can share that will help me have an intelligent convo with them (and not offend them by assuming they’re doing it wrong)) please let me know.

I always considered myself to be a forever lurker, but I’m finally ready to quit that and introduce myself. Thanks for letting me learn from all of you for so long. 

I’m looking for ideas, noticings or suggestions as I prepare for my first FET. We are in treatment for PGT-M (husband has a genetic disorder.) We have never tried on our own, but I have no reason to believe there would be additional fertility concerns (overweight but under my clinic’s threshold, regular periods after stopping birth control, OPKs that came back positive, all blood work normal.) I’ve done 4 retrievals in the past 6 months, AFC was 30-40 for each:

Mature: 23 (74%)

Cycle 4: 
Retrieved: 27
Mature: 21 (78%)
Fertilized: 17 (80%)
Blast: 2 (11%)

While I feel lucky and positive about the 5+TBD we have, it seems unusual to me that I would have a low-ish and seemly declining blast rate as time went on. Protocol stayed the same (75-150 Menopur, <187 Follistim, Cetrotide usually on day 5, Lupron triggers on day 8 or 9) and E2 on trigger day averaged 5500. After a tense visit with my doctor who suggested my expectations were too high (um, hello, you are the one who set and manage those expectations), I requested a DNA fragmentation that came back at 17%. 

We’re planning the FET for late March, and I want to ask for another complete blood work up in advance of that. Additionally, I’m having an internal battle on what to do if the first FET fails: move to number 2 or do another retrieval cycle. I worry that the retrieval would be fruitless, based on the current trends. 

I’m concerned that we are missing something that could influence the success of our FET. Is there anything else you would ask for, either through the lens of FET or another retrieval? Or anything I can do on my own? Or other suggestions for me to retain some bit of sanity in this wild ride?

TL;DR: how/when to talk to my IFChildFree coworker about my TTC.

My job recently hired a front-desk counterpart to my administrative position and we've hit it off quite well. We are practically best friends at work! She had mentioned in her interview that she and her husband had IF issues but gave up as it was ""rude to ask so much time off work"" she is about 15 years my senior and a child free cat mom now.

Here's the question.
My husband and I are finally getting into actual treatment territory after 4 years. And I'm not sure what steps to take to ensure my work relationship with the new girl doesn't take a huge hit.

- Should I wait to say anything until/unless we are successful?

- Should I invite her into my office and have a talk with her? Or ask her to lunch/coffee outside of work?

- What should I say?

I of course have a general idea of what to say as I have the empathy and understanding of someone struggling, but she is extremely sensitive about the topic including ""muting"" people who announce pregnancy (totally understandable). There wouldn't be any avoiding me if I had a success though as we work within 10 feet of each other.
I would definitely want her to know I understand if she doesn't want to be around me as a friend, but wouldn't want it to impact her work atmosphere.

And while we still have hope since we have sperm frozen, I’m starting to wonder if this will ever happen or maybe i just need to find a better clinic.</p>

This journey has been long and tedious. It’s literally one thing after another. 

In August 2019 I ended up in the ED because of pelvic pain. They told me I had a small cyst on my ovary and fluid in my remaining fallopian tube. 
Cue the antibiotics. 

I went to my doctor to talk to her about why I haven’t been able to get pregnant because we’ve been following our conception plan to the letter and nothing is happening. She told me that I needed to have this procedure done to make sure my tube is fully open. That the infection I had months ago may have sealed it up and if that’s the case, I have to have it removed for fear of ectopic pregnancy. 

Now if it’s not closed and the dye they shoot into my cervix goes through my fallopian tube then she’ll start me on clomid and we’ll see if that works. If it doesn’t then off to a fertility clinic we go. 

I am hoping the fertility gods will throw me a bone with some meat on it.

I’m struggling right now with grief... very badly actually and it’s affecting most parts of my life and marriage

I am infertile and this is my 11th year of constantly trying to be a mom. That time has included ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage, multiple IVF, four laraposcopys, donor sperm, partner sperm, no egg cycles and every protocol you can think of

I began at 30 and I’m now 42

The grief is indescribable and I often think of suicide. This isn’t how I thought the rest of my life would look, and an unwanted pregnancy in my teens haunt me

My current issue is this: I am considering IVF with donor eggs through a South African clinic. 

But I don’t know if my mental state is strong enough anymore to be a parent. I don’t know if 42 is too old (donor would be early 20s). I don’t know if I actually agree with egg donation being in the child’s best interests

But most of all, I don’t know if I just want this to make the grief stop, rather than because I still truly want to experience childbirth and parenting

I am wondering if anyone else has faced these kinds of thoughts and can share what helped them to know when enough was enough, and how to move on

I am also interested in any place anyone knows to talk about this that doesn’t also talk a lot about current cycles. I wish everyone the very best but sometimes I find cycle talk can be traumatising.

265,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I was just hoping to see if anyone has dealt with a similar situation and could provide some advice! Here are the details of our situation:

My sister-in-law had eggs frozen 10+ years ago because she had a fertility scare. She ended up having kids without IVF and no longer needs the frozen eggs. She has offered to donate the eggs to my wife and I to utilize since my wife has POF.

At the time of the egg retrieval, my sister-in-law did not go through the required testing for donor eligibility (the eggs were for her own use). I believe we meet the FDA exemption for donor eligibility (1271.90 3) and should be able to transfer ownership of the eggs. We had my sister-in-law tested for communicable diseases and she got the required physical exam and questionnaire, so that is taken care of.

<p>My sister-in-law had eggs frozen 10+ years ago because she had a fertility scare. She ended up having kids without IVF and no longer needs the frozen eggs. She has offered to donate the eggs to my wife and I to utilize since my wife has POF.</p>

<p>At the time of the egg retrieval, my sister-in-law did not go through the required testing for donor eligibility (the eggs were for her own use). I believe we meet the FDA exemption for donor eligibility (1271.90 3) and should be able to transfer ownership of the eggs.

I want to check if my fallopian tubes are clear but my OBGYN clearly doesn't want to, even though I specifically asked about it...not to mention the words 'you guys are so young' comes up multiple times at each appointment.

My partner's SA results came back with some concerning numbers in my opinion:

86 million total sperm

56% progressive motility

1% morphology (CASA)

4% DNA fragmentation

However, the vitality test showed that only 33% of the sperm were alive leaving us with 13 million total motile sperm. I'm not sure if only 1% of those sperm are 'normally shaped' or if the 1% is referring to the 86 million. Either way, I think it is very concerning but the urologist/andrologist diagnosis says 'mild subfertility' and to take some expensive vitamins and twiddle our thumbs for 3 more months.

We were really hoping to get going with an IUI cycle but of course, my OBGYN is not interested in doing anything.

\*Sub Rules and links to info and results threads below\*

Welcome to r/infertility. \*\*Please read our rules and our sidebar to familiarize yourself with the customs and guidelines of our subreddit before posting and participating here.\*\*

\*\*SUB RULES\*\*

Our sub has strict rules for participation. We ask that all members familiarize themselves with them in full, but here are the key points:

1. \*\*All positive pregnancy test (beta & HPT) results should ONLY be mentioned in the weekly results thread (stickied under this thread each week). Discussions of positive tests, including beta-hell/limbo, uncertain results, or early infertility pregnancy issues/fears are ONLY discussed in this thread.\*\*
2. Mention of pregnancy or live children is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as we had success after x,y,z protocol). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed. Note that mentions of pregnancy loss are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area. [More details of mentions of success and secondary infertility in this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/eumk6n/mentions_of_success_secondary_infertility_reminder/) Asking for success stories is against our rules. You may ask for people’s experience with a certain treatment but not fish for successful pregnancy stories.
3. Infertility is not cute, therefore cutesy acronyms (BD, AF (when used as a Aunt Flo), DH, embies, follies, etc) are banned. The full list of banned terms can be [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/bannedterms). As we all know, AF means AS FUCK. Yes, there will be cursing.
4. Infertility is stressful and it is easier to step on people’s toes than you might think. Please consider the emotional state of others during discussion here. Venting, jealousy and bitterness is to be expected.
5. No linking our posts outside of the infertility family.
6. If you see a post that breaks any of our rules or is troublesome to you please \*\*use the report button\*\*. The mods are happy to assess and remove or address reported posts. Let's all help keep this a safe, supportive community.
7. Set up flair so users are able to answer your questions with more information on your history. [Details on how to set up flair and what’s allowed in flair.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/db9xup/user_flair_reminder/)

\*\*Guidelines\*\*

\* Use the dailies! There are AM & PM threads posted by the automod. The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to treatment. The Treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.

\* Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD, someone else is going through what you are. [Details on when a stand-alone thread is appropriate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/dehxt5/standalone_posts_faq_reminder)

\*\*Helpful Links\*\*

Members of this sub can be here for a long time and certain posts can get repetitive. Please use the search function before posting questions that may be more common. A few helpful mega-threads and FAQ threads can be found at the links below:

[General FAQ and Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index) \- There are several spreadsheets maintained in the Wiki - Hunger games results, transfer data results, and medication pricing.

\*\*Other helpful reddit communities you may wish to consider:\*\*

For those who have been trying for a while or starting with infertility testing/treatment r/stilltrying has been a helpful transition sub for many before joining here.

For those who need support TTC after loss, r/TTCafterloss can provide unique support for this. For those transitioning to child free life after infertility r/IFchildfree is a safe space for this.

For those who have become pregnant after ART/IF treatment, or who have questions for people who have had success, r/infertilitybabies is for you.

For those with children who are experiencing infertility trying for more, r/secondaryinfertility or r/IFagain may be helpful and is a safe space to mention existing children while you explore your IF.

I've been waiting since September to do our next round of IVF and a thought struck me today: do I need to have my inflammation issues sorted out before my next egg collection or before my next transfer?

If it's the latter I could probably get going on that while waiting for surgery and by the time I've recovered from surgery, and have my ulcerative colitis under control, I'd (hopefully) have some PGS tested embryos in the freezer.
  
At the moment my situation is this: my husband has a low count and high DNA fragmentation due to a varicocele (which was surgically removed last year). I have an auto-immune illness (ulcerative colitis), which is currently flaring. An endometrial biopsy showed almost 50% inflammatory cells in my uterus (NK cells?) and so I'm awaiting a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, but it's not safe to operate while the UC is active. My AMH isn't super either: 5.6 in European numbers. 

Lastly, the UC doctor wants to put me on biological treatment for 6 months before I do more IVF.

Any thoughts on this? Is there any benefit to egg quality or EC numbers if I wait until I'm well? PGS testing here takes six weeks, which is why I'm wondering about getting a head start.

292,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"As you can see from my flair, I have been in this journey with ya'll for over 3 years. A few things I've been using to cope includes Reddit, counseling, and spending time with a specific group of friends. I moved to a small city in 2014 and met a few gals around my age that were either dating seriously or newly wed like myself. Eventually we turned into a little group of girlfriends. 

A weird coincidence about our group was that all four of us ended up with infertility problems. Not everyone was trying when we first met either, so it became something that bonded us even more. We would exchange doctor's advice, check on one another, and joke about our uncooperative reproductive systems. We started to call ourselves ""ugly ovaries"" to try to make light of it all.

When the first of us got pregnant we were all happy for her because it was still early on and it gave us hope. However, when she recently announced her second pregnancy all three of us were in a totally different head space - we clearly had been hurting for too long and lost a lot of that hope. I hadn't been in a good place for other people's pregnancies for a while, but I was surprised with my lack of joy for that friend.

Out of these girls there is one I'm closest to. She's my best friend, hands down, and she's been trying almost as long as me. It's great - even our husbands are best friends, and we spend a ton of time together. After my 5th FET with two remaining blasts, I decided I needed a break. My best friend also decided to take a break a few months later because of complicated reasons. She started taking birth control on October, so we were completely thrown off when she discovered she was pregnant. And like really pregnant, like 16 weeks in.

She wrote me a letter last week to tell me, and I had no idea that it would have the effect it had on me. I was broken up. Of course this was something that could happen, and we talked about what it would be like if either of us got pregnant, but it was much more intense than I expected. My first thought was, ""It's over. Our friendship won't survive this,"" and I cried over my own uncooperative body and the idea of losing her friendship. It took me days to even consider there's another possibility.

After a week I felt like I was ready to talk to her. I came to the conclusion that being a passive observer of her pregnancy and baby would eat me alive, so I would either need a TON of space... or, if she wanted me, I would want to be there every step of the way. I may never be able to have kids: my one sister, who lives across the country, doesn't want kids; my husband's sister, who also lives very far away, is unlikely to want much of my involvement if she ever has kids. This might be my one chance to be in a child's life.

So I shared this idea with her, and I was so afraid of sounding nuts and the possibility of rejection. Instead, she started tearing up saying she was really hoping I would be involved. She said she was scared and didn't want to do it alone, and that she felt like she needed me, but was afraid I would hurt too much. I'm sure there will be some hurt along the way, but I'm so happy that we can need and have one another right now.

I have been so trapped by grief. I'm sure other people's pregnancies will continue to hurt me and unhelpful advice will still piss me off, but right now I get to actually plan for a baby. Not my baby, but a baby I can love. Im still guarding my heart knowing that what my best friend wants or needs can change, and I have to be thoughtful not to overstep, so I know it's not the same.

We did IUI about 3 and a half weeks ago supported with 200mg vaginal progesterone suppositories. The advice from our RE was to stop the progesterone once menses occurs. 14 days later and there was no sign of menses so we took a home pregnancy test 2 days in a row and both clearly negative. We went in for a blood test the day after which also came back undetectable for HCG (<1). Still no sign of menses so we took another blood test 2 days later to confirm and it was once again completely negative. At this point the RE had us stop the progesterone.

Day after stopping the progesterone wife experienced mild spotting/dark old blood more akin to the last day or so of menses. She also had no period pains. Her usual period is very heavy with clots and very painful. After 2 and a half days the spotting has stopped and we’re at a bit of a loss as to what to do next. We’re contacting the RE tomorrow for advice but from all the reading we’re doing online we cannot explain wtf is going on. 

Tests we did before starting IUI didn’t result in any abnormalities for her but my sperm motility was on the low side. 

Has anyone had a similar experience after stopping progesterone? When can we expect the next normal period? Should we take a break from IUI for now? Biggest concern is that the uterine lining hasn’t shed enough for some reason and she’ll need to undergo a D+C.

Checking back in here, it’s been a little while and I am trying to make a decision now about timing of treatment.

My doctor has recommended IUI and I am planning to do it, but trying to figure out when. I have a pretty demanding job that I need to be able to think straight for and be functional every day, and not knowing what to expect in terms of IUI side effects makes me nervous 😬 

Have those of you that have done IUI been able to push through at work and function at a high-ish level? If not, what side effects got in the way and how long did they last? And any advice on how to manage working while IUI-ing?

I already took time off for a minor fertility-related surgery and am concerned about needing to take more time off for IUI, if side effects get bad. I’m also worried the hormones are going to turn me into a crazy person and I’ll end up doing reputational damage! I just don’t know what to expect. 

As a little bit of background, I’m PCOS-ish so they’re starting me on the lowest-levels of drugs I think.  I believe I can do all the monitoring appts before work in the AM. The only shot I have to do for the first round of IUI is the trigger shot at the end.

Trying to digest all this news and feeling profoundly uneducated on these issues given that all sex ed taught us was how NOT to get pregnant. 

Background  - 

I'm a 25F non-smoker that was on BCP for 8 years. Stopped in July 2019 and started TTC. I've been temping and using OPKs. Not overweight, exercise regularly, and eat okay (definitely better now with PCOS). I take prenatals, vitamin D, and Ovasitol. No one in my family has known fertility trouble. 

Husband is 26M non-smoker who is healthy weight, exercises regularly and eats okay too. Over the last 2 years he has actually lost 30lbs to be at a normal weight. Drinks a decent amount of caffeine - 300mgs a day, but rarely drinks alcohol. No one in his family has known fertility troubles - however his mom was adopted so we're not sure her family history. Also his mom has Celiacs Disease, but my husband was tested a few years ago and it came back negative. 

My husbands SA results are as follows:

Volume: 1.6mL
Viscosity: 1 
Concentration: 93 million/mL
Motility: 58%
Speed/Forward Progression: 1-3 
Total Motile: 86 million/mL
Morphology: 12% (using STRICT Reference range) 

Lab comments: Teratozoospermic sample 

We were waiting to go on Letrozole after getting his SA results. Not sure what the plan will be now after the results. 

Should we push to just see a specialist at this point? Would we even be good candidates for an IUI? 

I realize we're so early in this journey since we haven't tried any fertility treatments at this point. But I also don't want to waste a bunch of time and money doing tests and taking meds if the end result will still be an IUI.

311,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all--

I'm almost 36 and TTC for 6 months with no luck.  Hubby and I are going to get checked out next week, but pretty sure it's a combination of age and health (we're both overweight).  Assuming IVF is still on the table, we got a time-sensitive decision to make. 

Quick financial note, we are in quite a bit of debt. But long story short, we're in a much better financial position now and on track to knocking it out in 18 mos, so not really concerned there.

Getting back to IVF, we have 3 options:

1.  Stop paying down debt (just keep paying the min) and save cash for a couple IVF cycles in 1 year.  (Cash is king?  Maybe we'll get pregnant, as we lose weight?)

2.  Don't save cash.  Keep aggressively paying down debt, and in 1 year, use the credit card. (Save a little on interest?  Get cash rewards?  And maybe we'll get pregnant as we lose weight?)

3.  Get a loan or another credit card to pay for IVF ASAP.  (Better odds to start now?  Or not, because of health?)

Options 1 and 2 mean delaying IVF for about a year (when I'm 37), but gives us more time to focus on getting healthy.  Option 3 would obviously mean we would start IVF right away, but no time to lose weight.

I'm leaning option 3, just because I'm worried about delaying IVF.  We just really want a baby.  I know we can financially afford any of the options.

A quick intro on our situation is we tried for 12 months using opks, have good CM, using Ava temping with zero positive pregnancy tests. Zilch. Husband's SA results are wonderful. My complete RE workup is excellent aside from low progesterone. I have suspected endo, had an IUD put in to ease the pain, which worked for it's five years, but I never had a lap. I'm 1.5 years without the Mirena and my cycle was normal within 60 days of having it removed. 

I'm currently on my first medicated cycle, which is a monitored clomid-IUI cycle, with 50mg CD 3-7. My CD 11 US this morning was ""textbook."" Dominant ovary has three well developing follicles (19mm, 17mm, 14mm) and my other ovary is laying low. Great, double layer lining (I think she said double?) at 8.5 (mm? I can't recall the units). My complex cysts from CD 2 US are cleared. 

Awesome, right?  I'm so grateful I'm responding well to clomid! But for me, the best coping method is to not get my hopes up. I went from expecting IUI to be a waste (low success rates), to feeling slightly more optimistic reading several recent peer reviewed articles of studies with unexplained infertility and clomid-IUI (w/ trigger) with pretty solid success rates, AND several review articles supporting medicated IUI. 

So I ask you for personal experiences that may be similar as far as ""looking great!!"" leading up to IUI, at any stage, but the IUI failed. It would greatly help me stay focused at work today 😂.

In case my flair isn't working (as usual) I am 32 yo, with 33 right around the corner. Trying for #1. Thank you all!

Google is telling me the only other possibility is breast cancer but that is probably a far stretch. (Even though my mind is telling me that's totally possible and I'm panicking)

Been searching all over the subs for similar stories which there are many but I felt the need to chime in with my own. Wife (32) and I (34) have been trying for about a year. Within that year I’ve noticed some dull pressure pain in my left test. I finally went to the dr about and immediately had an ultrasound and sperm analysis. Turns out I have a small epididymal cyst which my doc says never goes away. Then I got my sperm analysts back.

Total concentration 40.8M

Motility 15% L

Progressive forward motility 30.0 L

Normal Sperm Morphology 3.0 L

My doc says its not the worse news as my count is still ok. He doesn’t know if the cyst is the reason but I’m reading mixed information on that fact. I would also like to do another SA as the one I did I think was tested just over 1 hour after collection, don’t know if that would effect the sperm in this way? It was also collected at home and driven to the lab in cold weather. The thing that won’t stop going through my mind is, what am I doing wrong to cause this? How did I even get this cyst?? I’m genuinely healthy, 205 5’11’’ I don’t smoke or use marijuana. I do drink regularly but keep it within the (higher-ish) limits. This is what keeps concerning me, even though I read mixed results on the high effects of alcohol to sperm. I know what you're going to say after reading that, which I’m concern of the dr doing the same, immediately rule out any other possibility and just say ""stop drinking, see if that works"". I also wear tighter underwear and have a tendency to get hot down there. I also sit most of the day for work and drive a lot, over 100 miles a day, if that could cause any problems? I've also been on high blood pressure medication and use Ritalin for many years. Another thing is, my wife and I have been together and sexually active for 14 years, always with a condom until started trying, and she was never on birth control. So we wonder even with condom, is the over all percentage of her never getting pregnant within that time a bad sign. Thank you if you’ve continued to this point.

I’m genuinely healthy, 205 5’11’’ I don’t smoke or use marijuana. I do drink regularly but keep it within the (higher-ish) limits. This is what keeps concerning me, even though I read mixed results on the high effects of alcohol to sperm. I know what you&#39;re going to say after reading that, which I’m concern of the dr doing the same, immediately rule out any other possibility and just say &quot;stop drinking, see if that works&quot;. I also wear tighter underwear and have a tendency to get hot down there. I also sit most of the day for work and drive a lot, over 100 miles a day, if that could cause any problems? I&#39;ve also been on high blood pressure medication and use Ritalin for many years. Another thing is, my wife and I have been together and sexually active for 14 years, always with a condom until started trying, and she was never on birth control. So we wonder even with condom, is the over all percentage of her never getting pregnant within that time a bad sign. Thank you if you’ve continued to this point. I fear judgment will ensue but I ask you to be kind. Until I see a specialist I&#39;m sitting here in the dark or the misleadings of the internet just assessing every bad habit I have and blaming myself. Thank you again</p>

As some of you know, we lost our third pregnancy at 8+6 after a rollercoaster of wonky betas, behind growth, good heartbeats, and growth catch up. I'm numb and drained and rather lost to say the least. We're already the 1% being 3/3, I'm worried we'll just not be able to get this to work.

I have two questions -
1. This was our third loss in a row from IUI / TI (lean pcos don't ovulate on my own) (chemical, Trisomy 16 mosaic at ~6 wks growth caught at 9 weeks, this one testing pending following d&c yesterday). IVF is next for us to help control for genetics but we're worried uterus is also an issue. Has anyone had a similar experience with RPL and actually gone on to have a healthy pregnancy that goes the distance?

2. We've done a semen analysis, carrier panels, full karyotypes, hsg, sis testing before this m/c. In my second pregnancy I started showing myometrial cysts out of nowhere so we are wondering if adenomyosis is also at play. 
Current plan: testing on embryo, infectious disease culture, clotting panel, MRI, receptiva, create embryos and do genetic testing, another SIS, hysteroscopy. Pending uterus findings likely lupron for 3 months before fet. What else should I be asking for?

The end of the report says 'oligoasthenozoospermia - suitable for ICSI only'. We were told this after going through my bloods and HyCoSy result in detail - despite knowing in advance that they were all fine. She was stalling. She spent ages on my vit D which is normal but slightly suboptimal for fertility. I'll take supplements, but this isn't why we can't conceive. 

We have really only been trying in earnest for 6 months. Nine if you count the careless few months before our proper 'let's do this, let's temp and track and bang it out' start date last August. I decided to push for an SA at 6 months as my husband has a varicocele which we were told might, miiiight impact fertility. 

Our doc took some more bloods today - a repeat progesterone from me post ovulation, hormone profile on my husband - and she has also referred us onto a reproductive urologist. She more or less said that she didn't think he could do much as the result was so poor, but that it was worth a try. The doc who initially diagnosed the varicocele said they weren't worried that it would affect fertility (that was years ago) and the consultant radiologist who did my HyCoSy also said they hadn't known varicoceles to be a major cause of MFI, and where there was suboptimal SA with varicoceles there was very little evidence to show that surgery improved things.

I now feel pulled between exhausting this (varicocelectomy, iced balls, extra lifestyle changes etc) and getting the ball rolling with IVF/ICSI. If we spend months and months fucking around with repeat SAs and feeling guilty over every coffee and beer etc and then still end up facing into IVF and all that I have heard it brings... Conversely if this RU can do something to help improve sperm quality I feel we would be remiss to jump straight to ART. Or would we be best to pursue both? Better chances with ART with improved sperm quality? 

My thoughts at the moment (just a few hours after our appointment so it's all very fresh but I'm a planner) are to proceed with both paths - make initial inquiries with the fertility clinic and go see RU person. I suppose I came here looking for insight and direction, or maybe just to get these thoughts down. I'm in the middle of a two week wait. I remembered that earlier and didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

347,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I've been lurking long enough. This is a new account because family members know my other Reddit account, and they don't need to know all the details of my sordid fertility history.   

This sub has been a ray of light in a land of ""live laugh love"" darkness. To whoever made the no acronyms rule, I salute you.  This is a long post, but I'm going to tell it all in case it might help someone else.  

**Part 1**:  I had a [LEEP](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/cancer/cervical-cancer/whats-leep) procedure ten years ago.  I didn't have insurance so I had to go to the free clinic at my college. My cervix had a lot of scarring from the procedure, and for the next decade of pap exams, I had to go to an OB instead of my regular GP because they had a very difficult time getting anything up there to scrape out cells.  Even when on my period, or ovulating, and/or with the drug they give you to relax your cervix, Cytotec, my *OB* would still have difficulty. I realize now that I had very obvious [cervical stenosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis_of_uterine_cervix) from the LEEP, but in a decade of OB visits I never received a diagnosis of stenosis of the cervix or any information that I might have trouble getting pregnant. I even asked my OB point blank 8 years ago if this would cause problems for my fertility, and she just asked me if I was still getting my period.  I said yes, and she said if I was getting my period I was fine.

Now, I am a mechanically minded person, and just because something can get out doesn't mean it can get in, so this never seemed right, but since I hadn't met Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes yet, I wasn't too worried about it.

I have since learned that this was not true, only the worst cases result in no period,  and I also learned that **a*****nyone*** can have cervical stenosis for a myriad of reasons, sometimes its genetic, or from a past infection, or from trauma, - like mine, or it may have an unknown etiology. Also, Cervical stenosis isn't just an inconvenience, it can [cause](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/miscellaneous-gynecologic-disorders/cervical-stenosis) hematometra (accumulation of blood in the uterus) and retrograde flow of menstrual blood into the pelvis, possibly causing endometriosis.

**Part 2**:  I'm now WELL into my late 30s. I finally meet Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes.  I want to have his babies.  *He* wants me to have his babies. We get married, we are gloriously in love. Being naive I thought since we were both in good health and in good shape, our age wouldn't matter. So we tried on our own for a while. (So stupid I was.)  

Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes was so excited to put a baby in me that he actually went and got his sperm tested first. Our results were not great. He had about a million sperm, and my AMH was .67. He was referred to a urologist and I got sent to an RE.  We were in the Midwest, and my RE options were limited.  I told my RE about my cervix and he flatly told me that's not why I can't get pregnant.  Dude, I know. I'm old. My eggs are old. My husband has almost no sperm. *I know that's why I'm not pregnant.* 

But, I tell Midwest RE, Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes is scheduled for a [varicocelectomy](https://maleinfertility.org/procedures/microsurgical-varicocelectomy)  \-  he had been diagnosed with bilateral grade 3 varicoceles, and assuming the surgery is successful, don't we want to give his sperm the best chance to get up there when we have sex on our own? (I had just watched [The Great Sperm Race](https://youtu.be/Fda5rigma14).) Midwest RE blew me off and told us to go straight to IVF. Ok, to be clear, I understand why he said that, but it didn't feel right. Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes was having other issues from the varicoceles i.e. despite working out 5 days a week with low body fat and great muscle tone, he had the testosterone level of an 85 year old man.  If IVF was a long shot for us anyway, wouldn't we want better quality sperm to give us the best chance?  

***And*** I kept thinking that even if we do IVF -  they're still going to have to get through my cervix. Why would you take the chance of my scarred-up no entry cervix damaging the *maybe* 1 or 2 embryos we had a chance in hell of getting? 

**Part 3**:  We were moving south anyway so we decided to do our fertility treatments there.  I started doing research, and Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes got scheduled with the best surgical urologist in town. Three months post surgery his sperm count  jumped to 13.4 million with 70% motility. It still makes me happy because so far that's the best news we've gotten in two years. Not to mention that he feels better and his testosterone levels improved to ideal.  

While he was recovering I started my fertility visits. The first RE I saw post-move scheduled me for more blood tests. Ok good I don't have fragile X, but now my AMH is .24? WTF it was .67 like 7 months ago.  She scheduled me for an HSG and then listened carefully to the saga of my cervix when I told her the Diagnostic Imaging Center probably wouldn't be able to perform the HSG. Her response was totally different from Midwest RE. She immediately performed an exam, and she attempted to insert an IUI catheter through my cervix. No entry. She really tried to shove it in there a second time and I yelped and jumped to the back of the exam table with the catheter still stuck in my cervix. Super dignified.  I had to scoot back down and relax before she could pull it out.

Southern RE said there was no way any sperm had been or were ever getting up there, and told me I needed surgery.  [Two weeks later I went under and she inserted a foley catheter in my uterus, inflated it through the attached tube, and left the tube coming out of my cervix to keep it open](https://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115(12)00450-2/pdf). I took estrogen (to keep my cervix soft and open while the catheter was in there) and walked around with that thing in there for two weeks. It was super weird, but not horribly uncomfortable.  The worst part was waking up right after the surgery.  My long neglected and unused uterus was displeased with its invader. It contracted and protested the uninvited balloon catheter. It felt awful, but I was in the recovery room and got more drugs and passed out a couple times until my uterus calmed down and accepted its fate. After that I could feel the end of the tube in my vaginal canal, but that was it.  Going running or doing yoga was out of the question, but it was only two weeks.  When the removal appointment came up, Southern RE simply deflated the balloon catheter in a routine office visit and removed it through my newly open cervix. 

My HSG two weeks later was a breeze. No pain or difficulties. My cervix was open. My tubes were open. My husband had 13 million sperm. We *maybe* have a .4% chance of getting knocked up on our own, but whatever...I'll take that over a 0% chance.

Now, with my hormone levels and age, I'm not a great candidate for IVF, but I did some research anyway. **If an HSG or a routine Pap hurts or is difficult for your medical provider to perform, you should ask about cervical stenosis, and possibly repair**. 

Here's why: Cervical Stenosis can cause a difficult embryo transfer. [In a 2002 study of 4807 embryo transfers pregnancy rates in the easy and intermediate embryo transfer groups were similar (30.3 versus 30.4% respectively) pregnancy rates after a difficult transfer dropped to 21.1%.](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/17/10/2632/607745)  A more recent study of 306 IVF candidates came to the following conclusion;  [Embryo Transfer is the clinical step that has the most effect on IVF outcome. Difficult transfers are associated with a fall in pregnancy rates.  The most common anatomical characteristics associated with difficult ET were abnormal crypts in the cervical canal (86%) and tortuosity of the cervical canal (68%)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0368231516301053).   Also, for most people surgery to repair cervical stenosis is a simple procedure with a quick recovery. I had to be put under general anesthesia, and that was the highest risk of the procedure. It is a procedure with high success rates and is even covered by most American insurance, because stenosis of the cervix is a medical diagnosis, not an infertility diagnosis.

We've done two IUIs with no success, and will be doing a third one soon.  Despite my diminished ovarian reserve diagnosis, I had a surprisingly good response to Clomid, and we may attempt IVF before we throw in the towel completely. I know our chances are dismal, but at least I know that I repaired the one thing I had control over. So I'll keep taking my Cq10 and Vit D and Metformin and Melatonin and thyroid medication and prenatal vitamins and cheering everyone on in this sub.

**Unnecessary and Ridiculous Addendum:** Please know, the following is just me relaying my thoughts to this sub, and I don't even know why I'm writing them out but I started typing and I can't stop, if you want to ignore any part of this post, please ignore the following paragraphs.

 I can't help but wonder if a decade of cervical stenosis contributed to my DOR diagnosis. There are so many studies demonstrating the numerous ways semen effects the female reproductive system.  And my reproductive system had the door bolted shut for a decade. I mean, the garage was open but no one was getting in the house...

I know trying to find a reason why something happened is a coping mechanism, but I was indulging in it anyway and then this study came out:  [Researchers analysed information about 2,936 women in their 40s and 50s.](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.191020)The women answered questions about their health, lifestyle, who else lived in their household, and their sexual activity. They were followed up for 10 years and the researchers found that women were less likely to have gone through menopause if they had weekly sex.  The study only shows a link between how often women had sex and their age at menopause. ***It cannot prove that having more sex directly causes a later menopause****.* But I think...ovulation takes a lot of cellular energy and it makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint that if you have no chance of getting pregnant - then your body wouldn't waste its resources on ovulation... and as a result your egg selection retrieval mechanism would get rusty and defective. 

I can't help thinking that my reproductive system is like my grandma's 1980 Chevy Malibu that sat in the garage and never got driven. I aired up the tires, changed the oil and brake fluid, charged the battery, put gas in it and it started, but SO much of it deteriorated from non-use.  The serpentine belt corroded, and the electrical is faulty so now the rear windows won't go up, the engine seals dried out and it leaks oil, the brake rotors are rusty, and the butterfly valves in the carburetor stick so I have so open the hood, unscrew the cover for the carburetor and stick a screwdriver in there to hold it open. But dammit it runs so I'm gonna drive it. Just not very far until I get new tires. 

And thats the thing..I've granted access to my reproductive system and I got it started. It's running but it will never run like a newer model. And now I'm racing the clock with it. 

Thank you to anyone who read this far. If nothing else know that you are not alone in your thoughts and feelings. This shit is hard. I'm proud of you. This process takes a level of courage that requires the most painful vulnerability while choosing a path that you know probably means walking face first into a wall of pain -and then getting up and doing it all over again, and again - I'm proud of us.  

But I still fucking hate it.

<p>Now, I am a mechanically minded person, and just because something can get out doesn&#39;t mean it can get in, so this never seemed right, but since I hadn&#39;t met Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes yet, I wasn&#39;t too worried about it.</p>

<p>I have since learned that this was not true, only the worst cases result in no period,  and I also learned that <strong>a</strong><strong><em>nyone</em></strong> can have cervical stenosis for a myriad of reasons, sometimes its genetic, or from a past infection, or from trauma, - like mine, or it may have an unknown etiology. Also, Cervical stenosis isn&#39;t just an inconvenience, it can <a href=""https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/miscellaneous-gynecologic-disorders/cervical-stenosis"">cause</a> hematometra (accumulation of blood in the uterus) and retrograde flow of menstrual blood into the pelvis, possibly causing endometriosis.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2</strong>:  I&#39;m now WELL into my late 30s. I finally meet Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes.  I want to have his babies.  <em>He</em> wants me to have his babies. We get married, we are gloriously in love. Being naive I thought since we were both in good health and in good shape, our age wouldn&#39;t matter. So we tried on our own for a while. (So stupid I was.)  </p>

<p>Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes was so excited to put a baby in me that he actually went and got his sperm tested first. Our results were not great. He had about a million sperm, and my AMH was .67. He was referred to a urologist and I got sent to an RE.  We were in the Midwest, and my RE options were limited.  I told my RE about my cervix and he flatly told me that&#39;s not why I can&#39;t get pregnant.  Dude, I know. I&#39;m old. My eggs are old. My husband has almost no sperm. <em>I know that&#39;s why I&#39;m not pregnant.</em> </p>

<p>But, I tell Midwest RE, Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes is scheduled for a <a href=""https://maleinfertility.org/procedures/microsurgical-varicocelectomy"">varicocelectomy</a>  -  he had been diagnosed with bilateral grade 3 varicoceles, and assuming the surgery is successful, don&#39;t we want to give his sperm the best chance to get up there when we have sex on our own? (I had just watched <a href=""https://youtu.be/Fda5rigma14"">The Great Sperm Race</a>.) Midwest RE blew me off and told us to go straight to IVF. Ok, to be clear, I understand why he said that, but it didn&#39;t feel right. Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes was having other issues from the varicoceles i.e. despite working out 5 days a week with low body fat and great muscle tone, he had the testosterone level of an 85 year old man.  If IVF was a long shot for us anyway, wouldn&#39;t we want better quality sperm to give us the best chance?  </p>

<p><strong><em>And</em></strong> I kept thinking that even if we do IVF -  they&#39;re still going to have to get through my cervix. Why would you take the chance of my scarred-up no entry cervix damaging the <em>maybe</em> 1 or 2 embryos we had a chance in hell of getting? </p>

<p><strong>Part 3</strong>:  We were moving south anyway so we decided to do our fertility treatments there.  I started doing research, and Mr. IcyVeinsBloodyEyes got scheduled with the best surgical urologist in town. Three months post surgery his sperm count  jumped to 13.4 million with 70% motility. It still makes me happy because so far that&#39;s the best news we&#39;ve gotten in two years. Not to mention that he feels better and his testosterone levels improved to ideal.  </p>

<p>While he was recovering I started my fertility visits. The first RE I saw post-move scheduled me for more blood tests. Ok good I don&#39;t have fragile X, but now my AMH is .24? WTF it was .67 like 7 months ago.  She scheduled me for an HSG and then listened carefully to the saga of my cervix when I told her the Diagnostic Imaging Center probably wouldn&#39;t be able to perform the HSG. Her response was totally different from Midwest RE. She immediately performed an exam, and she attempted to insert an IUI catheter through my cervix. No entry. She really tried to shove it in there a second time and I yelped and jumped to the back of the exam table with the catheter still stuck in my cervix. Super dignified.  I had to scoot back down and relax before she could pull it out.</p>

<p>Southern RE said there was no way any sperm had been or were ever getting up there, and told me I needed surgery.  <a href=""https://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115(12"">Two weeks later I went under and she inserted a foley catheter in my uterus, inflated it through the attached tube, and left the tube coming out of my cervix to keep it open</a>00450-2/pdf). I took estrogen (to keep my cervix soft and open while the catheter was in there) and walked around with that thing in there for two weeks. It was super weird, but not horribly uncomfortable.  The worst part was waking up right after the surgery.  My long neglected and unused uterus was displeased with its invader. It contracted and protested the uninvited balloon catheter. It felt awful, but I was in the recovery room and got more drugs and passed out a couple times until my uterus calmed down and accepted its fate. After that I could feel the end of the tube in my vaginal canal, but that was it.  Going running or doing yoga was out of the question, but it was only two weeks.  When the removal appointment came up, Southern RE simply deflated the balloon catheter in a routine office visit and removed it through my newly open cervix. </p>

<p>My HSG two weeks later was a breeze. No pain or difficulties. My cervix was open. My tubes were open. My husband had 13 million sperm. We <em>maybe</em> have a .4% chance of getting knocked up on our own, but whatever...I&#39;ll take that over a 0% chance.</p>

<p>Now, with my hormone levels and age, I&#39;m not a great candidate for IVF, but I did some research anyway. <strong>If an HSG or a routine Pap hurts or is difficult for your medical provider to perform, you should ask about cervical stenosis, and possibly repair</strong>. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s why: Cervical Stenosis can cause a difficult embryo transfer. <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/17/10/2632/607745"">In a 2002 study of 4807 embryo transfers pregnancy rates in the easy and intermediate embryo transfer groups were similar (30.3 versus 30.4% respectively) pregnancy rates after a difficult transfer dropped to 21.1%.</a>  A more recent study of 306 IVF candidates came to the following conclusion;  <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0368231516301053"">Embryo Transfer is the clinical step that has the most effect on IVF outcome. Difficult transfers are associated with a fall in pregnancy rates.  The most common anatomical characteristics associated with difficult ET were abnormal crypts in the cervical canal (86%) and tortuosity of the cervical canal (68%)</a>.   Also, for most people surgery to repair cervical stenosis is a simple procedure with a quick recovery. I had to be put under general anesthesia, and that was the highest risk of the procedure. It is a procedure with high success rates and is even covered by most American insurance, because stenosis of the cervix is a medical diagnosis, not an infertility diagnosis.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve done two IUIs with no success, and will be doing a third one soon.  Despite my diminished ovarian reserve diagnosis, I had a surprisingly good response to Clomid, and we may attempt IVF before we throw in the towel completely. I know our chances are dismal, but at least I know that I repaired the one thing I had control over. So I&#39;ll keep taking my Cq10 and Vit D and Metformin and Melatonin and thyroid medication and prenatal vitamins and cheering everyone on in this sub.</p>

<p><strong>Unnecessary and Ridiculous Addendum:</strong> Please know, the following is just me relaying my thoughts to this sub, and I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m writing them out but I started typing and I can&#39;t stop, if you want to ignore any part of this post, please ignore the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but wonder if a decade of cervical stenosis contributed to my DOR diagnosis. There are so many studies demonstrating the numerous ways semen effects the female reproductive system.  And my reproductive system had the door bolted shut for a decade. I mean, the garage was open but no one was getting in the house...</p>

<p>I know trying to find a reason why something happened is a coping mechanism, but I was indulging in it anyway and then this study came out:  <a href=""https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.191020"">Researchers analysed information about 2,936 women in their 40s and 50s.</a>The women answered questions about their health, lifestyle, who else lived in their household, and their sexual activity. They were followed up for 10 years and the researchers found that women were less likely to have gone through menopause if they had weekly sex.  The study only shows a link between how often women had sex and their age at menopause. <strong><em>It cannot prove that having more sex directly causes a later menopause</em></strong><em>.</em> But I think...ovulation takes a lot of cellular energy and it makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint that if you have no chance of getting pregnant - then your body wouldn&#39;t waste its resources on ovulation... and as a result your egg selection retrieval mechanism would get rusty and defective. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help thinking that my reproductive system is like my grandma&#39;s 1980 Chevy Malibu that sat in the garage and never got driven. I aired up the tires, changed the oil and brake fluid, charged the battery, put gas in it and it started, but SO much of it deteriorated from non-use.  The serpentine belt corroded, and the electrical is faulty so now the rear windows won&#39;t go up, the engine seals dried out and it leaks oil, the brake rotors are rusty, and the butterfly valves in the carburetor stick so I have so open the hood, unscrew the cover for the carburetor and stick a screwdriver in there to hold it open. But dammit it runs so I&#39;m gonna drive it. Just not very far until I get new tires. </p>

<p>And thats the thing..I&#39;ve granted access to my reproductive system and I got it started. It&#39;s running but it will never run like a newer model. And now I&#39;m racing the clock with it. </p>

<p>Thank you to anyone who read this far. If nothing else know that you are not alone in your thoughts and feelings. This shit is hard. I&#39;m proud of you. This process takes a level of courage that requires the most painful vulnerability while choosing a path that you know probably means walking face first into a wall of pain -and then getting up and doing it all over again, and again - I&#39;m proud of us.  </p>

<p>But I still fucking hate it.</p>

<p>Edit for grammar.</p>

Prior to starting this cycle, my doctor and I discussed adding an HCG booster to my semi-natural FET prep, as there is evidence that the HCG can help with implantation. 

The plan we settled on was to come off birth control, and not start PIO until 6 days prior to transfer, and add estrogen and the HCG booster. 

At my last ultrasound and bloodwork appointment on Tuesday, no one mentioned the HCG trigger shot, only that I would start PIO the following day to align with my ERA recommended window of 125 hours. I was also told to start oral Estrace. 

My lining on Tuesday was trilaminar and measured at 7.25, which the doctor said was great. My estrogen levels were rather low, having decreased from 113 on 1/20 to 99 on 1/28. Progesterone was .02 and .03 respectively. These levels seems odd to me, on the low end of the ranges for ovulation phase. 

I called the IVF coordinator today to ask about the HCG trigger and was told the doctor vetoed using it since he deems my lining and levels are fine. 

This goes against what we previously discussed, and I’m confused. I also greatly distrust the IVF nurse; she has given me incorrect information several times and never really seems to know what she’s talking about. But she said that was doctor’s orders and I’m not sure about it to be honest. I don’t trust that she actually spoke to him. 

I really am not pleased to be skipping the HCG shot. 

So, asking about rogue protocols. If I wanted to secretly take the trigger shot, when would be the right time? I’ve had two doses of PIO (1.5cc) already. I haven’t been keeping track of my temps or LH surge because they told me not to bother. 

Has anyone used HCG in a semi-natural FET and if so, when did you trigger? 

I don’t necessarily want to go against doctor orders, but at no point was it communicated to me that my own hormones would determine whether it would be used. 

I obviously want this transfer to work, and go into with the intended kitchen-sink approach.
