My OB/GYN told me I should make an appointment with the fertility specialist and get on Clomid or something.

I have so many questions though.

Does a low AMH at age 33 definitely mean early menopause?  Or can it go up and down? If my periods stopped in January, does that mean they're never coming back or is there a chance that my body will randomly start ovulating again?

Apparently even just visiting the fertility clinic to ask questions is going to be a few hundred dollars, so I'm just trying to figure out what my options are.

Got the bad news yesterday, and it was the worst score yet. We have seen 5 transfer days come and go since egg retrieval in late November. I'm devestated, so much ugly crying yesterday, and focusing on breathing to keep from having an anxiety attack. 

We've spent $750 dollars on this test that only tells us that my uterus is not ready to accept an embryo, it looks at environment and receptivity.... but doesn't tell us WHY or what's wrong. My doctors done no tests to rule anything out... only change my protocols. I'm so frustrated. we never anticipated these delays. 

Our last meeting before this protocol, doctor said there was one other protocol we could try, either that or I could go on depo-lupron shots in the butt for 3 months to put me into menopause and ""restart"" things.  I think we are going to go this route, and on top of that ask for some tests to rule out potential causes. 

This process has been so hard. there is literally something wrong with every part of my reproductive system. PCOS, blocked tubes, and whatever the hell is going on with my uterus. 

It's hard not to wonder if it will ever happen. Add on top of that our social worker asked us if the Doctor had brought up surrogacy to us yet.... initially I was like NO we are not there yet! But with this latest cancellation, it's hard not to wonder if that will be our route.... which is so upsetting. I've always wanted to experience pregnancy. 

Anyways... I'm all over the place. Have to call the doctors office to book our WTF appointment. And will go from there... but looks like I'm out until at least August.

My SO and I have been actively TTC for about 2 years now. I say actively because I have PCOS and knowing that, we never bothered with protection for the past 5 years. A month ago, I went for ovarian drilling (OD). Since then I've been bleeding and spotting non stop. I can't take chlomid because I've no idea when my period is really starting and if I'm just spotting now. Gyne keeps saying it's normal and to just let my body clear itself out. Frustrating to say the least. Let's not even talk about the number of friends who are suddenly pregnant this year or are lapping me for the second time.

My SO is away for the night for a friend's wedding and we were texting each other. He suddenly drops a bomb on me and says he's tired and wants to move on with our lives. He doesn't want to go back to the gyne anymore and wants to stop actively TTC. He wants to focus on his career and he wants us to travel again. We stopped traveling for two years while TTC for fear of me getting preggers while overseas. I asked him what if I suddenly get pregnant now, would he resent me. He says he wouldn't but he just is tired of everything we're doing now in the quest to parenthood. I told him lets talk about it when he's back and he agreed.

I don't know why I'm here really. I feel the same way on one hand. I miss travelling the world with my SO and I miss having sex with no expectations. On the other hand, I feel the pressure to have a child and I'm starting to hate even going to meet friends because of all the babies and the questions. The only place I feel free is at work because I'm just me. No one asks me when I'm having kids or judges me on being childless.

Does anyone feel this way? Has your SO ever told you that? My SO is the best and he has been so supportive and comforting throughout this journey. But right now I don't have anyone else I can talk to about this and I just feel so alone. I wish I could stop desiring for children if only to stop my heart from breaking.

<p>My SO is away for the night for a friend&#39;s wedding and we were texting each other. He suddenly drops a bomb on me and says he&#39;s tired and wants to move on with our lives. He doesn&#39;t want to go back to the gyne anymore and wants to stop actively TTC. He wants to focus on his career and he wants us to travel again. We stopped traveling for two years while TTC for fear of me getting preggers while overseas. I asked him what if I suddenly get pregnant now, would he resent me. He says he wouldn&#39;t but he just is tired of everything we&#39;re doing now in the quest to parenthood. I told him lets talk about it when he&#39;s back and he agreed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m here really. I feel the same way on one hand. I miss travelling the world with my SO and I miss having sex with no expectations. On the other hand, I feel the pressure to have a child and I&#39;m starting to hate even going to meet friends because of all the babies and the questions. The only place I feel free is at work because I&#39;m just me. No one asks me when I&#39;m having kids or judges me on being childless.</p>

<p>Does anyone feel this way? Has your SO ever told you that? My SO is the best and he has been so supportive and comforting throughout this journey. But right now I don&#39;t have anyone else I can talk to about this and I just feel so alone. I wish I could stop desiring for children if only to stop my heart from breaking. I don&#39;t know what to do or think. I&#39;m just so confused right now.</p>

I'm currently on birth control pills.  The plan was to keep me on the pill until after my surgery, at which time we'd talk about a day to go off the pill and start prepping for my FET.  

Heres the rub: my post-op follow-up is Tuesday (12 days after surgery), and I only have active birth control to last me through Sunday.  I sent a quick e-mail in to the doc to ask whether I should take the week of placebo pills and induce a period next week, or refill my prescription and keep on active pills until our talk with her at the follow up.  Doc came back and said it was completely up to me and that whenever I went off pills and had a period we'd baseline to get ready for the FET.  To me, this seemed to indicate that if I somehow felt ready for it, say, tomorrow, then it was OK to just get the ball rolling.  it feels like maybe she misunderstood my question or wasn't thinking about how recently I'd had surgery.  More likely, though, she's right and none of it really matters.  She knows I'm smart, so the timing seriously is all up to me.  

I really don't think I'll be ready to gear up for a FET for truly at least another week, maybe longer.  Today is the FIRST day since surgery where I felt just about like my normal self energy-wise.  I don't think I'm at 100% - maybe 99.  I think today marks the day my digestive system is finally regular again, and I don't feel sore anymore at all.  That said, my stitches aren't fully dissolved, my belly button is completely scabbed over and itches like hell, and even the liquid band-aids they put over my incisions aren't all the way off.  (There's one left, and it is literally hanging on by a suture thread. I'm worried about it tearing off, so I just put Neosporin on it and it's covered with a Star Wars Band-Aid, 'cause why not?) TL;DR: I know I'm feeling tons better already, but I JUST HAD SURGERY A WEEK AGO?! Is my body really ready to gear up for a possible pregnancy? I feel like it's sending me some signals that I need to wait.  

To add insult to injury...I'm spotting.  I had a little spotting in the days post-surgery, the doc told me to look out for, but it was way, way less than what I expected, and it stopped right away.  The spotting started again yesterday - right around the time in my BCP cycle that it started when was pre-egg retrieval. I'm not sure about what staying on active hormones through this spotting is going to do to my hormone levels.  Last time we kept my on active pills through spotting like this pre-IVF, I ovulated through the pills and wound up set back a week from starting stims.  

If you gals were me, what do you think you'd do?  I'm leaning towards just staying on active pills until at least Tuesday and seeing what happens hormone-wise.  But if coming off pills will help hit the reset button on whatever is making me spot right now, maybe that's beneficial.  I'm kind of just scratching my head at what the right decision would be.

When we got there I was so disappointed to find out that we would only see him in the second half of our first consult, as a resident would be “practicing” on us. No call beforehand to check with us, just literally told us that while we were walking down the hall to the office. I sucked it up and said nothing. 

The resident was super nice, but basically just went over our intake forms – stuff like “do you smoke?” Answer “no, as we stated on the form.” I get why they double check this stuff, but it just felt like we were going through some predetermined list of questions to ask. As I noted in my intro post, we have done a whole gamut of regular tests with my GP and OBY/GY: HSG, semen, general day 3 and day 21 hormone tests, ultrasound to confirm ovulation, and PCOS tests. We were told everything is normal and thus we are unexplained. 

I started pushing for a few more tests; specially, I asked if they do AMH tests and was told it was unnecessary for me (due to age (31) and normal hormone levels). I also asked about auto-immune panels and was told that they are unreliable.
 
So basically, I waited 5 months to see an intern who told me what I know already and refused to do anymore tests to possibly determine what our issue may be. The RE finally came in and basically gave us the regular unexplained option: IUI with letrozole. He predicts we have an 11% chance of conceiving this way. 

So then I start asking more questions around issues that I have learned on this forum (thanks internet peeps). I brought up my light periods and asked if this may be due to my uterine lining being too thin. They seemed to dismiss it, saying there is no reason it would be thin. However, I pointed out that my last ultrasound measured my uterine lining at 4mm around ovulation (follicle was 20mm). First, they seems surprise by this (the didn’t notice it before) and then they seemed to suggest that this may be a mistake made by the ultrasound tec. They said they would have to check it themselves next cycle, but still pushed for the IUI. 

We left so disappointed. I mean, it is great to have options, but it is as if they are unwilling to even try to find out why I cannot get pregnant. Rather than assess our situation as individuals, I felt totally grouped into this “unexplained status.” This is mostly a rant, but tell me, am I crazy for wanting more information? Again, both the RE and intern were super nice, but is there anything that should sound an alarm bell?

58,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So this all happened on Sunday, but I was not in a mood to post until now.

Sunday morning my husband was very good about not making me get out of bed until just before we had to go to his parents' for the day (he even went out and brought breakfast to our bed). I was spending time on another sub /r/maleinfertility when I came across an article about a study that showed electro magnetic radiation caused from men keeping their cell phones close to their testes may affect sperm.

I read the article to my husband and his first response was ""pfft, that's just silly"".

I think it kinda created a hole in my emotional dam. I started leaking tears unconctrollably as he continued, ""It's like your dad with the electrical box on the front yard.""

I asked him why he though it was silly and he said that he knew plenty of men who carried their phones around in their front pockets and they all had kids. So when I asked whether or not he had done any research on the actual science before just dismissing it as 'silly' he admitted he hadn't.

Irrationally it made me angry. I'm over here researching constantly on anything proven, or not, that could possibly increase our chances. I'm taking vitamins, I'm taking medications, I'm trying to change our eating and activity. Meanwhile he thinks his having to give up pop (my ruling) was a big deal.

So then I asked him if he has done any research at all on anything that could help with his low sperm count (according to my gyno), or looked into adoption (we can't afford any medical procedures). He says no. Of course I asked him if he had any idea how hard it is to feel like I'm going through this on my own because he's fighting me constantly on small changes that affect him, and he's not looking into anything, he doesn't really pay that much attention when I try to share what I've been finding, and I have literally no one else to turn to.

I think he kind of got the picture.

So I had to shower and freshen up, because we had to leave to go spend the day with his mother.

We get out there and she asks us what's new in our lives. So I tell her we have an appointment at a fertility specialist in July, and that we have been looking into the adoption process through our province's government. My SIL is excited about the kids we've been looking at on the site that made us feel like maybe that could be a step for us.

MIL and SIL tell us that as soon as we adopt we'll end up pregnant because we'll have stopped stressing about it.

FUCK YOU!

So I calmly, and politely told them that we only want one child whether it is biological or adopted. So once we have our one child I am going to look into get my uterus and ovaries removed to reduce my chances of uterine and ovarian cancer, and to make my life easier by not having to deal with PCOS.

They just continue on about how we need to not think about it and it will happen.

Thankfully my husband stepped in and changed the topic of conversation before I could start crying again.

Sorry for the rant, just not sure how to deal with stuff like this.

There are also ejaculation issues.  For as long as I can tell he has been shooting blanks.  I know this could be a complication due to Diabetes or it could be other things.

68,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi! I've been around here and commenting since January, but never gave a real intro until now.

I could write a novel, but I'll try for the almost brief version... My husband and I have been trying since 10/14 with unexplained infertility. Generally speaking, I don't have any major ongoing health issues, but had cancer and chemo 17(!) Years ago, and 2 rounds of pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs) that were related, but never fully explained. Luckily, i don't have any genetic red flags for clotting issues, but it leaves that as something else that's just unexplained. I consulted with a MFM clotting specialist when I started trying to conceive, and he recommended I take Lovenox once pregnant. He later advised I start it once I started fertility treatment after things didn't happen according to plan with the getting pregnant business.

I'm so close to starting my first IUI cycle. I starting seeing my RE in January, though had a consult with a doctor in another city last June. I was set to start Clomid and IUI in January, but was sidelined by low vitamin D levels. My RE insisted they be above 30 before I start. Took 2 months of high dose prescription strength D (ha), and my test results came back lower. Referral to endocrinologist, special test (mass spectrometry?), lab fuck up, re-draw, 2 week wait for results, and the special test revealed my levels are actually OK. That shit took 5 months total. Now I'm trying to track down the MFM who told me to take Lovenox, because he is no longer with the hospital group I use, and I can't speak to him without a referral from my RE and my period is due yesterday. I need to know when to start taking Lovenox, because I'm pretty sure he means as soon as I'm on Clomid, though the RE nurse was thinking not until I'm pregnant. I'm not even sure I'll have everything lined up for this month. But that's pretty much my medical story.

Other than trying to keep all that straight, I love gardening and fixing up our older house that we bought just about a year ago. We're getting close to finished on a huge project to finish off our attic, which has taken copious amounts of time, patience, and money over the past few months. I have a small dog who is the best, and keeps me sane as cliche as the sentiment may be. I work for a university from home doing data analysis, and really enjoy what I do. I love working from home, and it's been a huge boon with the parade of doctors appointments I have sometimes. My commenting history probably has plenty of me moping about my husband's job loss earlier this year, though he's working through the details of formalizing an unofficial offer he got last week. YAY! 

The first third of 2016 was one of the most brutal periods I can remember. Things seem to be turning a corner at the moment, and I really hope things continue looking up.

So glad this sub is here, and I think you guys are tops!

A few months ago I pretty much taught a friend how to get pregnant. She had NO idea what to do and I feel like I had to explain basic biology to her. Guess what? She got pregnant and here I am still waiting and planning on doing IVF. Needless to say, I was miserable, I had a total mental breakdown for days, more like over a week.

I honestly felt like I hit a wall, I even told my parents and my husband that I was done, if I can't get pregnant, no point in even living the rest of my life. It was probably one of the worst episodes of depression I have gone through. 

I had planned to meet this friend later this week for a ""virgin"" happy hour (btw, how ridiculous is that?) Anyway, I decided to say eff it and move on. I cancelled on her last weekend and deactivated my Facebook account. I felt really bad cancelling on her, but gosh, I feel good to not have to see ""baby bump"" pictures or having an invite to a baby shower I won't go.

I need a small paragraph and a few choices phrases in my brain to say/reply when I see or hear people imply that women who are having trouble getting pregnant need to relax.  I get entirely too upset by that phrase, so I'd like to combine our powers of research to examine the evidence and then boil it down to a big old polite FUCK YOU, MR. I KNOW NOTHING McWRONG (as I said, I get upset).  

Here is what I have thus far:  

But I did a little research.  Do higher stress levels reduce conception?  The answer is complicated and the research is mixed.  Research on stress is hard to do and has confounding factors.  We know that about 80% of infertility has an explained medical explanation- low sperm count (that SOMEHOW no one is attributing to men's stress levels....except that it really might http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/277543.php), blocked fallopian tubes, premature ovarian failure, etc.  That leaves the 20% that I happen to fall into, which makes my hackles raise even more.  Because let's just go with it- let's just say it's my stress levels- then that means I process stress in a different way than 87% of women out there OR that my stress level is higher than 87% of other women's.  Women get pregnant during horrible times, my mom got pregnant two months after her first child died, women in war zones get pregnant, women who are facing death sentences get pregnant but somehow my stress from wanting to get pregnant is either more than their stress or affects my body differently.  Does that really make sense?  And if stress does affect my body differently, is it possible for me to live a stress free life?

The research that suggest stress might play into it is all horribly flawed.  One study showed that a massage before the embryo transfer increased conception rates (sign me up!) but that ignores the process of getting the eggs, which is the greater and more stressful process.  Another found that in a survey of women going into embryo transfers that the 20% of women who rated their stress the highest also had the fewest eggs retrieved and had the lowest quality eggs and had the lowest success rates ([Source: shitty WebMd article that leaves much to be desired and doesn't cite their sources](http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/features/infertility-stress?page=2)).  But OF COURSE those women were the most stressed out- they had the fewest eggs and shitty odds! A didn't cause B, B caused A!!!!  Certainly stress can fuck up the menstrual cycle so can we count stress out if you have regular periods?  

Another study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy might result in infertile women being able to conceive [source](http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep06/stress.aspx) but then again In 2003 there was a small literature review of 8 studies and 3 showed an effect of stress reduction on infertility and 5 did not- but all of the studies had problems (drop out rates, small sample size, etc) that included that particular study mentioned above.

Possibly the best study that has found a link between stress and infertility was [this one](http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Stresss-effects-on-fertility-studied.aspx) but it barely made it to statistical significance and while the women had different levels of bio markers for stress, they didn't rate their stress any differently. So are you telling me I am unusually stressed *and don't know it*???  Plus it was completed in 2009 and I haven't seen it replicated. Plus the biomarker found to have a connection is also affect by other factors such as food intake, exercise, etc.  Cortisol-the most infamous stress hormone was found to have no predictive power. 

Also, are there limits to the effect that stress can have?  Like, maybe stress could delay conception for 6 months but probably not 6 years?  It seems impossible that stress alone could cause a couple to be unable to conceive for years.  

If you want a decent concise article, here is [one](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/11/stress_and_infertility_the_weak_link_between_them.html) that I think gets into why stress is such a convenient conclusion for people to draw and breaks down the weakness of the link between stress and infertility.  

I personally believe this idea has roots in sexism, dating back to when women's illnesses were labeled as hysteria. Again, some connections between MFI and stress have been found but no one says ""just relax"" to men nor do those findings make sensationalist headlines like [Can't get pregnant? How stress may be causing your infertility](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/womens-health/articles/2010/08/27/cant-get-pregnant-how-stress-may-be-causing-your-infertility) with the lead ""It's true—worrying and obsessing about your inability to get pregnant can make it that much harder.""  (The article is about the study I mention about about the stress bio-marker. Never in the study was it measured what women were stressed out about, so saying 'obsessing about your inability to get pregnant can make it take much harder' is absolute baseless conjecture,). It's a neat and tidy theory and supports that life is fair and if you do the right thing (relax) the right thing (pregnancy) will happen.   

1. Do you have more research to share?

2. Any really good articles?

3. How do I boil this down to a few short phrases or paragraphs?

4. Do you think, given all of the facts above, a jury would really find me guilty for assault if I throat punch the next person who implies that I need to relax?

Unfortunately today didn't go as well as we had hoped or planned for.

We went into today with 12-13 mature-sized follicles, another 5-7 medium-sized follicles.  Our doctor was positive about how things looked on Friday, he thought we should get more than 15 eggs in total but a few wouldn't be mature.

Coming out of surgery, the doctor who did the retrieval (not our doctor but a senior doctor at the clinic) informed us that they were only able to get 9 eggs overall.  Apparently there was an issue with the eggs detaching from the walls of the follicles like they are supposed to do to prepare for ovulation.  I'm not sure I went into this realizing that was a thing at all - that there would be eggs but they might not be retrievable.  I was still kind of out of it (and a bit shocked too) but he basically was saying that the Lupron is supposed to make the eggs finalize maturity and start floating around inside the follicle, but before that time the eggs are attached to the follicle wall.  And I guess the Lupron wasn't very successful.  (This all clearly makes me question if I ever got an egg out of a follicle during any of my IUI cycles using that little ol' ovidrel shot)

About an hour later the embryologist came to talk to us, and of the 9 eggs, only 5 were mature.  Some of you may recall that we only planned to ICSI 5 eggs and freeze the rest, because we didn't want to have a situation where we had to deal with destroying leftover embryos.  So to some degree it's convenient that we were only planning to ICSI 5 eggs to begin with so that was a pretty easy decision, but the real letdown is that we had such a significant sudden dropoff and thus we have no additional eggs to freeze and move to if these 5 don't have any that make it from fertilization to freeze.

Needless to say, this was overall fairly disappointing.  I have a good egg reserve, we started with a lot of follicles (my AFC was 35), but perhaps now we have found a piece of our unexplained infertility puzzle.  That's the thing about IVF - especially the first one - it's as much diagnostic as it is treatment, if not more.  We will likely have an appointment with our doctor soon to discuss his thoughts on all of this, what happened, etc.

We'll get an update tomorrow sometime from the embryology lab letting us know how many eggs have fertilized.  After that, they said they won't be giving us updates along the way, they'll just call us on Sunday (day 6) to let us know how many, if any, made it to freeze.  I'm ok with that honestly.  I'm just going to work this week and try to distract myself.  Though I'm still taking tomorrow off to rest up and protect myself depending on the fertilization news.

Anyway, thank you all for your kind words this morning.

I truly apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but this concerns a lady friend that I'm very much interested in.  Also, english is not my first language so forgive me if my grammar is not the best.  Here's what happened.

I met ""Nicole"" last month at a social gathering of a group I just joined and we hit it off immediately.  I'm a 42 years old single father of a five years old girl and dating and meeting new people is not exactly my strong point to be honest, but Nicole had a friendly demeanor and I found it very easy to talk to her.  We exchanged numbers and she texted me the next day to say that she was glad to meet me and would like to see me again.

I was of course very happy and a week later we had an amazing first date of dinner and wine.  The conversation was relaxed and friendly and we both put our cards on the table about what we were looking for.  I'm not a player, never have been but I let more than one good woman get away from me due to my immaturity.  At this early stage Nicole really looks like a keeper as Americans like to say.

Anyway, fast forward to our third date in a local park, we're holding hands and as we're sitting on a bench and it seemed to me that she was kind of struggling to hold her usually jovial demeanor.  She asked me if having more children was important to me and maybe because of the language issue or the way she phrased the question I took it to mean that she wanted to have children and wanted to know if I was open to that.

I answered that due to my experience with my previous relationship that ended up with me sharing custody of my daughter my focus was first to having a strong relationship build on mutual love and respect and if that was in place then yes, I would love to have one or more kids.  I kind of noticed there that maybe that was not the answer she was looking for and I asked her if she was okay with my response (by the way, my spoken English is not as good as my writing so maybe I did not explain myself as well as I'm writing here).

It was then that she told me that she was infertile and briefly explained to me about MRKH.  Her smile gradually returned to her face, but I felt like I had misunderstood her original question.  I thought she asked me how did I felt about us having babies, but what she was asking me was that if I wanted to have a relationship with her even though we would not be able to have children.

I made sure that was the case by asking her directly if that was really what she wanted to know and she responded on the affirmative.   Life never prepares you for that type of situation and I really wanted to be honest with Nicole.  I told her that I was happy that at such an early stage of our relationship, when we are basically still feeling each other out she trusted me enough to tell me this and also... that she was already thinking long term about us and this was not just a short term fling.  I was smiling when I said that as I realized that for Nicole maybe I was a keeper too...which made me very happy.

I also told her that my feelings about her have not changed, that I really liked her a lot and wanted to continue with our relationship and that if a few months for now we decided that we really love each other and want to settle down the fact that she was infertile would not be a problem with me.  I said that because I really mean it.  Like I said, we've just met last month, has had a few dates and I have not seen any red flags in the horizon.  She's intelligent, funny, very jovial... I smile a lot and really enjoy it when we're together.

I just want to know if I handle the situation properly, as this was a real surprise for me.  I care a lot about Nicole and the last thing I would want to do is to be insensitive and unsupportive.

I am so angry at my family. At my father who shamed me the first time I was pregnant because my bf happened to be black, and forced me to have an abortion. I am pissed off at myself for letting myself be shamed. Multiple times. I am mad at myself for not standing up for what I believed in, and having enough faith in myself that I could and would find a way to succeed... I am angry at myself for having multiple abortions (while on birth control) because I was waiting to do 'the right thing', and taking my ease at conceiving for granted, and assuming there was nothing wrong with me (I really, really wish the doctors  had picked up on how fucked up my hormones must have been for this to have happened... Something wasn't right, and no one ever examined it further). I am pissed off at believing there ever would be a perfect time, place or person. I am angry at myself for not realizing that the MANY, many times that I had a late or painful period that I was in fact miscarrying.

I am fucking pissed off that even if I had continued those pregnancies I most likely would have lost them due to the Lupus gene that I carry.

 I am fucking pissed off about having not one but TWO auto-immune disorders!!! I am pissed off that it took IF for a fucking doctor to listen to me when I said that I didn't feel like myself... Who blamed my fatigue on depression and prescribed me meds. I am mad that I went undiagnosed for so long, because if I had known..  If I had known... I would have made different choices.

I mad for buying into the illusion of the American dream. I am mad at my stupid partner who says that I can 'have' his daughter... As if that is the same! I am fucking angry, NO, I am PISSED off that he said I needed to rally and be happy for my sister when she got pregnant their first time trying... I AM FUCKING ANGRY because everything seems to work out right in her life and not in mine, no matter how hard I struggle or try. And I am tired of being guilted or blamed for not being overly ENTHUSIASTIC about being around her, my family or mothers in general... And no, being an AUNT is not really the same.

I am tired of being told to get over it and to move on. I am fucking sick and tired of being told that if I was SERIOUS about having a baby, I should be jumping up and down with excitement about being a running lab experiment. Try this drug, try that drug... Yes, we are draining your bank account, but who cares? I am tired of being looked down upon for being 'weak' and having horrible side effects that make it hard to function (thanks bff). I am tired of being told that I need to get SERIOUS and stop messing around, when I have been trying to get pregnant for the last 3 years. I am tired of being told that my trying naturally and with drugs and donor sperm and, and, and, and... Is not enough.

I hate the person I am beginning to see when I look in the mirror. I hate how IF is running my life. I really, really wish that I didn't want to have children. But I really do.

I have had 3 miscarriages since September, and I am tired of being told by other people that they weren't real pregnancies, because I miscarried so early... And that they really didn't count- plug in story about how so and so lost her baby at so many weeks (and yes, I do feel bad these woman... Omg, do I...),  and I should just be glad it happened early. 

.I am tired of being told, be thankful, kids aren't all they are cracked up to be. You could have a child that hates you. Yep, this is true, but I would feel blessed to even have had that experience. 

I am tired of hearing from my partner that being a stepmother, an auntie and having dogs should be enough.  I am tired of hearing how blessed I am to have as much freedom as I do, to be able to travel and have my own business, as if that somehow replaces the dream that I had for my life, or my desire to share my soul and genetics with my own off-spring.

I hate how close I am to giving up, because I just want off of this damn circus train. 

I had this weird idea that I would walk into my RE doctor's office, be told what was wrong with, go through a series of tries and walk away with a baby... And unscathed. Frankly, I am not sure that any of me is left unchanged. How can it not be? I am not a mom. Period.

And yes, mother, you can go fuck yourself. I fucking hate you and my sister too for talking in DETAIL about the stage of growth her baby is in when you KNOW I lost a baby at that exact same stage. I really don't need to hear about limbs and heartbeats and little, tiny fingers... I really fucking don't... And I am tired of being the bad person for not being able to handle this.

I am tired of hurting so much, of pumping myself full of drugs that make me gain weight, puke and have horrible migraines. I am tired of it all.

And yet, I still keep trying... Because people around me claim I never gave it (IF treatment) a full chance... And if I was SERIOUS, I would take a month off of work and just be a miserable human being that was being pumped full of drugs and literally could not think or feel past the side effects.

And I really, really don't want to leave my house today, on Mother's Day. I just don't.

Fuck them.

Fuck IF.

I want my life back... But I want try one more time to have a baby first. Omg, I am going to cry... I really don't want to want this. I feel like I am having to choose between having a baby or having myself.

Got my protocol today.  So in history I've done IVF twice and feel I was under medicated.  First was 150 gonal-f and 75 menopur on the long lupron and second was unsuppressed 150 follistim and 150 bravelle with ganrilex. First cycle got 5 eggs (although I did ovulate some early- up to 5 eggs) but only one fertilized and didn't make it to day 5.  Second cycle got 5 with 4 fertilizing and 1 making it to day 5 and was PGS normal, with a failed FET.  

My protocol is BCP for about 4 weeks, 225 follistim, 225 menopur for 3 days then dropping to 150.  Add ganrilex probably around day 8.  I expected higher stims because our plan is to push towards OHSS and do a freeze all.  My new AMH results are 1.3- a 50% drop in a year (although having done a lap, which usually drops AMH).

Feeling ""out"" already, tested...and nothing can make that second line appear. 

I know it ""might"" be too early to test but we've been down this TTC road nine times already with 7 failed IUI and 2 IVFs under our belts. I have the same feeling here. 

I'm reading on Reddit that lots of you ladies have estrogen and other blood tests done more frequently than my RE does them. For example after the trigger shot. Is it common to have no clear answer as to if/why a person ovulated through medicines? Or if trigger didn't work, can this fail IVF?

I'm wondering if my RE is not blood testing enough because every failed IUI and IVF she throws her hands up like she can't even believe what just happened. All other tests look good and now I am paranoid that I'm not ovulating or that I'm ovulating too soon. they say that your first cycle will be a diagnostic cycle but for us it was just: ""we have no idea""

Scheduled an appointment with my regular doc to see if she can test for other things that might be causing this... Any suggestions? 

I've heard ""natural killer cells"" and ""prolactin"" and ""thyroid"" suggested. I have an appointment on the 15th to talk to my doctor because I'm not feeling at all hopeful about our beta (on the 10th - Mother's Day. Hooray). Wife has started suppression for another retrieval because we aren't hopeful at all. 

Any suggestions or hints as to how to ask a general practitioner to help? All physicals and other tests (hsg, oh) look good! 

Thanks for ANYTHING you can give me!

I'm really only as sore right now as I was after egg retrieval, and I had a bit of shoulder pain earlier this afternoon, but that seems to already have dissipated mostly with the pain meds. 

Both of my tubes were successfully removed without much trouble, which gives the doc and I peace of mind heading towards my frozen embryo transfer. Nothing's 100% (if you can believe it, there is a possibility that an embryo will float up into the stump of tube they had to leave behind attached to my uterus), but we're pretty confident in saying there will be no more ectopics here, ever.

We did have one little surprise though: once the surgery was underway, the doctor found stage 1 endometriosis tissue on both of my ovaries and on the back wall of my abdomen behind my uterus. I never had any endo symptoms since going off birth control three years ago, and no one ever saw anything suspicious on any ultrasounds, so finding it today was definitely a bit of a head-scratcher. Just the same, we're lucky to have found it and been able to easily remove it, because this means we'll have an even higher chance of IVF working now that the tissue is gone. Had my tubes remained patent and this surgery never happened, I'm sure that the endometriosis would have continued to grow and caused me even more problems in the future. Upon hearing the news in recovery, I immediately asked the doc if endo could have been responsible for my ectopics, and he absolutely agreed with my theory that some of the tissue could have also been gumming up the fimbrae at the ends of my tubes and prevented eggs from going where they needed to. (As of today, my tubes were just plain scarred, so it's hard to tell if any endo used to be there.) Long story short: a bonus problem led to an explanation for my ectopics we were expecting never to get.

I've been having lots of feelings and emotions, and this has become a HUGE part of my life, so I thought I'd start SLOWLY coming out to some friends. 

I started yesterday with a friend who has always seemed pretty open-minded and kind. We're close, but not super-close, but I really enjoy her company. Anyway, we went out for dinner last night and I started telling her what we were up to (just finished our first IVF, FET coming up soon). 

She was quiet while I was telling her, and then her first words after I told her were ""I don't think you should go ahead. If you do this, your kids will be born without souls"". 

WTF?!! I was absolutely speechless and then promptly burst into tears. She just sat there. 

She's never been particularly religious or anything, so I have no idea why she would say something like this. 

I finally managed to tell her to learn something about science before she ever spoke to me ever again. Paid for my meal and left in tears. I won't be seeing her again and wondering if I should block her/delete from Facebook. 

Sorry for the huge rant. I am so hurt. I was really trying to be brave and this was really the first foray in 'coming out'. I'm just so crushed.

Also curious if anyone has a similar backstory to mine that turned out successful.

TTC the first time in 2012. Diagnosed with PCOS when my periods were totally absent, on the second round of Clomid + TI I ovulated and got pregnant with my daughter. Totally healthy and uneventful pregnancy, and when I was done breastfeeding I went on Metformin to control PCOS symptoms. It regulated my cycle but it remained anovulatory.

On to now, TTC #2. Since January, I've had 2 rounds of Clomid + TI at increasing doses as well as a Femara + Ovidrel round, all of which failed to get me to ovulate. So we've moved onto injectibles (Gonal F + Ovidrel) and despite having no clinical indication for IUI we're doing it because my RE feels the chance of achieving pregnancy with injectibles + IUI is greater than injectibles + TI.

Thus far, my ultrasounds and bloodwork are showing that my ovaries are being pretty damn stubborn. They've already doubled my dose of Gonal F and had me start injecting in my arm muscle instead of belly fat so it absorbs more quickly. Given my history I'm not totally convinced they'll get me to ovulate but RE seems certain I will, it's just a matter of increasing things slowly so that I don't make too many eggs.

However, I'm willing to travel further if it means I can get better care and avoid unnecessary delay.   Since my cycles are aprox 40 days long, my opportunities to conceive are few and far between and every missed round of tests or diagnoses pushes me further and further down the road.

As you know, we will get our ultimate FET (only a Day 3, perfect on paper, but still might be the carrier of a unbalanced translocation) later this summer. As the first FET failed, and Day 3 have only 30% chance of so to implant.... yeah.

Anyways. We are thinking of the other options :

1) Let it go and go on with out life.
2) IUI with donor sperm (IUI are covered, we will need to pay for the donor sperm, 700 $ if we use our clinic tiny bank, add the taxes and all and maybe 800$ per shoot?).
3) A ultimate IVF, ICSI, micro-tese, with a back-up donor. First IVF on Repronex, I had 24 eggs. If we have a backup donor, half could be injected with donor, and half with what they find in husband's. (Price : about 13 000$, plus 7000 $ for donor and probably another 1 500 if ISCI is needed, plus 1 000$ to freeze the embryos (i tend to do OHSS) and 1750 $ per fet. Plus the medications, that might not be covered anymore. So add maybe 6 000$, soooo scary costs).

I'm afraid of option 2. I have pcos-ish looking ovaries (but no PCOS apparently), but i react to stims like someone with PCOS. I will turn 34 this summer. Re said there was nothing to suggest IUI would not work, but yeah, how many of you did so many IUI before moving to IVF.

Option 3 is freakly pricey, but, it will give another chance to my husband. When he saw the urologist, he said they had better results in his right nuts (the one they cut open for IVF 1). But then, we got no blast in that IVF 1. The internist said giving the cost, maybe it was not that worst it to try again.

163,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello!  This is my first time posting here as I have been over at the TTC board.  But they suggested I might try this board for our current issues.  I'm going to do a short version and a long version so feel free to read either. It's been a long, dramatic month for us so the long version will be a lot of venting.

SHORT VERSION: Has anyone been able to get IVF covered by their insurance in California? My wife's plan does not cover fertility, however, we have discovered a genetic problem that requires us to undergo IVF (plus a bit more) to have a healthy child. Our doctor thinks it's now possible to get the procedure at least partially covered since it is medically necessary for both mother and child. I was curious if anyone has been through this before and if you have any tips or tricks that made it successful. Thanks!

LONG VERSION: Oh man, oh man. This journey has been a brutal emotional beating.  My wife and I have been trying since October and had suspicions that something was wrong.  Back in Feb, I got a sperm test and found out I had a low count (7.1 million density).  Not the end of the world but we may need to do IUI for successful fertilization.  

A month ago, we had finally had our official fertility consultation since I just did the semen test as a one-off and discovered a cyst and other unusual readings in my wife's ovary ultrasound. We were starting to freak out and get a little concerned.  Blood work was done on both of us to (1) start trying to figure out my low sperm count and (2) check her hormones due to the unusual readings in the ultrasound. 

We then discovered that cyst, etc. is probably minor but her FSH and AMH results were in the diminished reserve levels and while not dire, she probably only has 1-2 years of reserve left (she's 32). We were sad but a there was still some hope and time. 

About a week later we get another call from the doctor. He has also run a genetic screening on my wife. The results were in and she tested positive as a carrier for....Fragile X Syndrome. I don't know how much that has been discussed on this board but its a mutation on the X chromosome that causes a repetition in a gene that escalates in each generation until the gene fails, resulting in intellectual and physical disabilities such as autism and early ovarian failure. What makes it even more interesting is that normal results for the test in females are 2 numbers representing the number of repeats in each X chromosome (since females have 2 X chromosomes). However, my wife's test came back with 3 numbers - 2 in the dangerous premutation stage and 1 in the normal range!

As you would expect, this has everyone confused. The most likely cause is lab error so her test is being run again at a different lab. However, alternate scenarios are that she either has an extra X fragment floating around and/or that she has mosaic DNA in which one X chromosome split abnormally during her development resulting in some cells having one set of XX chromosomes and others have a different set of XX chromosomes. Yeah, crazy. The big question now is what sort of combination she has. Is the extra X a mutated version or a normal version? Basically does she actually have a good X to pass on?

If she does, then we can do IVF to have the baby though even that's not simple. We obviously have to make sure the embryo gets the good X. But Fragile X cannot be detected at the embryonic stage. So a special probe has to be made that maps the entirety of her X chromosomes and can tell which is which. Only like 3 labs in the country do this and it will take 2-3 months.

So now we wait for the 2nd DNA test to come back so we can move on the next steps. If she does not have a good X, that's basically the end for her having biological children and we have a big decision to make. If she does have a good X, we move forward on the probe/IVF but obviously the costs are stacking up so we're trying to get insurance involved now that its a medical issue. Our doctor is amazing and really fighting for us but any help you all may have would be great. We have family loans lined up but would obviously prefer not to do that. If any of you have been through similar with your insurance, we would greatly appreciate any advice you may have.

Thanks for reading this long, long post. There's even more I can vent but I'll at least cut off the main post here. Oh! One sort-of positive-ish is that we did also find the cause of my low sperm count which is vericoceles - vericose veins in the scrotum overheating the sperm. It's fixable though the doctor actually doesn't want me to fix it right now since IVF will already just pick out the best sperm and it is a built in mechanism for preventing natural conception since we would likely have a fragile x child. So a weird silver-lining.

Our doctor thinks it&#39;s now possible to get the procedure at least partially covered since it is medically necessary for both mother and child. I was curious if anyone has been through this before and if you have any tips or tricks that made it successful. Thanks!</p>

<p>LONG VERSION: Oh man, oh man. This journey has been a brutal emotional beating.  My wife and I have been trying since October and had suspicions that something was wrong.  Back in Feb, I got a sperm test and found out I had a low count (7.1 million density).  Not the end of the world but we may need to do IUI for successful fertilization.  </p>

<p>A month ago, we had finally had our official fertility consultation since I just did the semen test as a one-off and discovered a cyst and other unusual readings in my wife&#39;s ovary ultrasound. We were starting to freak out and get a little concerned.  Blood work was done on both of us to (1) start trying to figure out my low sperm count and (2) check her hormones due to the unusual readings in the ultrasound. </p>

<p>We then discovered that cyst, etc. is probably minor but her FSH and AMH results were in the diminished reserve levels and while not dire, she probably only has 1-2 years of reserve left (she&#39;s 32). We were sad but a there was still some hope and time. </p>

<p>About a week later we get another call from the doctor. He has also run a genetic screening on my wife. The results were in and she tested positive as a carrier for....Fragile X Syndrome. I don&#39;t know how much that has been discussed on this board but its a mutation on the X chromosome that causes a repetition in a gene that escalates in each generation until the gene fails, resulting in intellectual and physical disabilities such as autism and early ovarian failure. What makes it even more interesting is that normal results for the test in females are 2 numbers representing the number of repeats in each X chromosome (since females have 2 X chromosomes). However, my wife&#39;s test came back with 3 numbers - 2 in the dangerous premutation stage and 1 in the normal range!</p>

<p>As you would expect, this has everyone confused. The most likely cause is lab error so her test is being run again at a different lab. However, alternate scenarios are that she either has an extra X fragment floating around and/or that she has mosaic DNA in which one X chromosome split abnormally during her development resulting in some cells having one set of XX chromosomes and others have a different set of XX chromosomes. Yeah, crazy. The big question now is what sort of combination she has. Is the extra X a mutated version or a normal version? Basically does she actually have a good X to pass on?</p>

<p>If she does, then we can do IVF to have the baby though even that&#39;s not simple. We obviously have to make sure the embryo gets the good X. But Fragile X cannot be detected at the embryonic stage. So a special probe has to be made that maps the entirety of her X chromosomes and can tell which is which. Only like 3 labs in the country do this and it will take 2-3 months.</p>

<p>So now we wait for the 2nd DNA test to come back so we can move on the next steps. If she does not have a good X, that&#39;s basically the end for her having biological children and we have a big decision to make. If she does have a good X, we move forward on the probe/IVF but obviously the costs are stacking up so we&#39;re trying to get insurance involved now that its a medical issue. Our doctor is amazing and really fighting for us but any help you all may have would be great. We have family loans lined up but would obviously prefer not to do that. If any of you have been through similar with your insurance, we would greatly appreciate any advice you may have.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this long, long post. There&#39;s even more I can vent but I&#39;ll at least cut off the main post here. Oh! One sort-of positive-ish is that we did also find the cause of my low sperm count which is vericoceles - vericose veins in the scrotum overheating the sperm. It&#39;s fixable though the doctor actually doesn&#39;t want me to fix it right now since IVF will already just pick out the best sperm and it is a built in mechanism for preventing natural conception since we would likely have a fragile x child. So a weird silver-lining.</p>

<p>Anyways, now its really the end.</p>

I'm always been pretty vocal about the situation in Québec.
As you, we were the first provinces in N-A to fund up to 3 cycles of in vitro.
Well, the Liberal Government slashed the Program last autumn.

The only solace is that in the moment, the medications is still covered by the provincial medicare, but they want to remove the said-coverage. Things work funny in Québec, if those medications are removed from medicare, lot of private insurance company will also remove the coverage.

It's illegal here to have private insurances to pay for treatment (except for knee and hip replacement surgeries and one eye thingy). So, all IVF are to be out of pocket.

So, the coverage of the medications is the only things that can help.

<p>The only solace is that in the moment, the medications is still covered by the provincial medicare, but they want to remove the said-coverage. Things work funny in Québec, if those medications are removed from medicare, lot of private insurance company will also remove the coverage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s illegal here to have private insurances to pay for treatment (except for knee and hip replacement surgeries and one eye thingy). So, all IVF are to be out of pocket.</p>

<p>So, the coverage of the medications is the only things that can help.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-5987/index.html"">https://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-5987/index.html</a></p>

<p>Here the text of the petition in English :
WHEREAS Infertility affects one 1 in 6 couples of childbearing age in Quebec;</p>

<p>WHEREAS infertile couples pay taxes and duties as all other citizens Québec;</p>

<p>WHEREAS the World Health Organisation recognizes infertility as a disease in its own;</p>

<p>WHEREAS the Quebec government recognizes infertility as a disease (giving a tax credit);</p>

<p>WHEREAS intrauterine insemination and ovarian stimulation treatments are covered by the Régie de l&#39;assurance maladie du Québec;</p>

<p>WHEREAS infertile couples have been sufficiently affected by Bill 20, An Act to enact the Act to promote access to family health services and specialized medicine and other legislative provisions on assisted procreation;</p>

<p>WHEREAS the Association of infertile couples from Quebec was not consulted by the INESS;</p>

<p>We, the undersigned, ask the Government of Quebec to maintain the public insurance coverage for the medication used to treat infertility.</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>

My wife and I are trying to have a baby. Quick background: I am on several antidepressant medications which have an unfortunate sexual side effect of rendering me unable to reach orgasm during intercourse. (I am able to from masturbation.) So as you can imagine, this puts a damper on the baby-making effort.
We went to a fertility clinic to look into intrauterine insemination - come in at the right part of my wife's cycle with a semen sample, and they put it in. Sounds doable.
Unfortunately, last week my wife's insurance notified us that they will not be covering the treatments. This is because technically, my wife has no fertility issues. All her initial blood work, ultrasound, etc. were 100% normal. Without insurance coverage, IUI costs around $1,500 per treatment. We are going to try up to six cycles (where the doctor says we have about a 50% chance of conceiving).
So apparently, Massachusetts has a mandate that insurance plans must cover fertility treatments (https://www.fertilityauthority.com/costs/insurance-coverage/massachusetts-infertility-insurance-mandate). It requires the treatment to be covered if you are unable to conceive for at least a year (six months if you're over 35, which my wife is). The wording of the law defines infertility as an individual who is “unable to conceive or produce conception” during a period of one year if the woman is under the age of 35. If the woman is over the age of 35, the period of time is only six months. It makes no statement about what the cause of this ""infertility"" is.
I know this is a narrow scenario, but if anyone has any advice or insight I'd greatly appreciate it. Is it worth fighting the insurance over this because of the mandate?

I just wanted to share with a group of people who understand my frustration. The conversation came about because I mentioned:
1) I'm leaving for a cruise to the Bahamas this weekend and I'm looking forward to getting away from all the stress at work and IF treatment for awhile
2) My husband is not on board with me going on BC so that our IVF protocol can start ASAP after my tubal ligation surgery.

So her response was first, ""well maybe he's hoping that you'll go on the cruise and relax and it will happen."" Which started me on a long rant about how annoying it is when people say ""just relax"" to IF people because there is no other medical disorder where you would tell someone to relax and it will go away.

That's when she came in with the ringer of ""Just relax only works if they've checked everything else."" That just hit a nerve. Like she was dismissing all of you wonderful ladies I've come to know on here and in my support group that are unexplained. I couldn't help but explode on her about how insensitive that is and there is no scientific support for that, etc. for about 2 min and without taking a breath.

Her response was not ""I'm sorry"". It was, ""well then how do you explain your aunt trying for over 3 years and then 3 months after adopting she gets pregnant?""

Ok first off, why do I have to explain one persons experience against a mountain of scientific data and additional counter examples? But in any case it lead to explosion #2:

""well they know a lot more about procreation now Han they did 40+ years ago when my cousin was born. It's possible that she was ""trying"" and assuming she ovulated 14 days before her period because that is the average luteal phase, but she actually has a much shorter or longer one. Like me, I have an 11 day luteal phase. If I assumed it was 14 days long I would miss my fertile window EVERY TIME! So it's possible when she stopped ""trying"" she actually hit her fertile window for the first time!!!!"" 😡

Still she doesn't say she's sorry. Instead she tells me about her fried who was told by a dr (again probably 40+ years ago) that her recurrent miscarriages were due to stress and how could I explain that.

I give up. So I just say that dr was probably wrong and reemphasized that they know a lot more about procreation now then they did back then, especially thanks to IVF research and advancement. 

She closes with that she didn't believe that dr either. So W.T.F.? Why even bring it up? Do you like hearing me explode? Did you just want to stump me or did you just want to win an argument? I mean FUCK. 

The whole reason I called her in the first place was to tell her about my pre-op appointment and tell her when the surgery would be because she said she would fly in to town for it. I agreed to let her come for the surgery because I thought it would be a good idea to have a woman for support through that. I think the emotional toll will be harder than the physical one.

197,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all. I have some questions about my wife's condition.

She was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis at 23 (I think) and has been on levothyroxine (Synthroid I believe) ever since. Her condition was discovered when she got checked up back then for rapid weight gain and general lethargy. She's 32 now and has always struggled with the extra weight since back then, but this isn't really about that.

We've been trying to get pregnant for about two years now and have had no luck. We've basically tried everything except IVF at this point, and before we spend a lot of time and money on that (or adoption, which can end up being just as expensive), we wanted to look into getting her body straightened out and hopefully being able to get pregnant naturally.

So her cycle's been messed up ever since she was diagnosed. It's just now approaching some semblance of regularity, but even still it fluctuates quite a bit from month to month (and even then, she very rarely actually ovulates). She has never done too much research into her thyroid condition on her own and has just trusted her doctors about it.

She's asked a couple doctors about switching to NDT/Armour/pig thyroid stuff over the years because she has a couple friends who made the switch to it from levo and showed improvements all around (weight, general well-being, menstrual issues, etc.). Every doctor she's asked about switching has strongly discouraged it, and she didn't pursue it beyond that.

So with our pregnancy problems, I've been helping her do more research. Her thyroid levels seem to fluctuate a lot, and the weight loss (she's been working hard to lose weight this year and has lost 20 pounds already) seems to be affecting her levels as well, so she's been going in to her endocrinologist a bit more frequently.

On her last visit, she mentioned switching to Armour to the nurse practitioner (she very rarely sees the actual doctor), and apparently this woman looked her straight in the eye and told her that ""it's impossible for the placenta to absorb the pig hormone"" and that switching off of levo while we're trying to get pregnant would be a bad idea.

We did some research that night, though, and were unable to find a single source to back up the NP's claim. Not only that, we found several instances--posts on message boards dedicated to thyroid stuff, personal accounts--of women who were only able to conceive after switching to NDT/Armour and were totally fine throughout the pregnancy (with regular checkups to measure their thyroid levels of course).

So I guess I have two questions:

1) Is there any grain of truth at all to the NP's claim that the placenta would be unable to absorb NDT? I'm hesitant to call this woman a liar, but I could not find anything to back her claim up online and in fact found evidence of the opposite (anectodal evidence, but still).

2) What can my wife do to get her doctor to switch her to NDT/Armour? Her current doctor is one of the ones who has talked her out of it in the past. We're looking for a new endocrinologist in Austin because she doesn't really like her current one (and this thing with the NP has certainly not helped), but it seems like she's had a lot of pushback from several doctors about getting off levothyroxine, and all with very general ""not as accurate, etc"" reasoning. Her cycle has been wildly irregular from the beginning on levothyroxine, her body temperature is always weirdly low (like 95-96 degrees), and the whole weight and fertility thing...she really just wants to finally try something different to see if it helps, but she hasn't had a single doctor yet who allowed her to switch.

/u/bunnabon: Will probably start suppression for IVF #1 after I inevitably get a negative HPT around 5/13.

/u/pinksultana: Ugggg I have three measly kilos to lose to meet the BMI requirements to start fertility treatment, I have lost 36kg so far but yet these last 3 feel so much bigger because they are the only thing in our way of getting the ball rolling. Super frustration times.

/u/BrownEyedGirl82: Waiting to see my peak OPK result after another round of Clomid so we can proceed with IUI #2. Good luck to everyone!

207,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Finally had my pre-op appointment for my bilateral salpingectomy this Thursday after last week's mess of rescheduling and chaos.  (I totally sent the nursing and patient services staff some cookies today, by the way.  Good lord, they deserve it for all they're doing to keep things running when they're down unexpectedly by one doctor.  My consult was at a different office than I'm usually seen at, and I caught at least two nurses also working there today who are usually never at that location.  You can tell that all hands are on deck trying to maintain continuity of care. I'm sure everyone in the practice could use a little love this week...hopefully I did OK by sending some along.)  

Anyway, in the interest of creating a record of this experience for anyone else who will go through it in the future, I got the low-down on everything that will happen to me on Thursday.  Here goes.  

I'll drift off to la-la land and be given some IV antibiotics to prevent infection. Once I'm in my happy place and totally unaware of what's going on, the doc will puncture my belly button with a needle and fill my abdomen with CO2.  Then, he'll turn my innie belly button into an outie temporarily, make a small incision, and insert the lap camera.  Before proceeding with removing my tubes, he'll do a dye test to determine exactly how messed up they are and whether they should be fully removed (as we're expecting) or just clipped.  Assuming they're both dilated and distally blocked as we think we saw on my most recent HSG, two other small incisions will be made on either side of my abdomen, and one will be made in the center at about my bikini line. Doc will cauterize my tubes bit by bit, remove them through the incisions, and send the tissue off to pathology to see if we get any definitive answers about why my tubes are so messed up.  (We all seem to agree that we'll probably never get a reasonable explanation, though.) I'll be sutured up with a few small sets of dissolvable stitches, and we'll put some sort of fancy plastic coatings over the top that are waterproof.  (Yay!

I've been told that Thursday I should feel ""like I lost a few rounds to Muhammad Ali"" I should also be aware that although he'll try his best, the doc may not be able to remove all the CO2 and I may feel some displaced shoulder pain as the gas rises up to my diaphragm. I will likely turn a corner by Saturday and, surprisingly, be back at work by Monday morning of next week.  I'll have a follow-up appointment in two weeks to make sure the sutures look OK, and on that date we'll probably also baseline me so I can start meds for my FET.

pre-stim ultra-sound revealed ~22 follicles and I was put on CD2 starting with 150 Gonal-F (doctor was afraid of overstimulation), US monitoring at d5 of stims (CD7) gave 6 big, 18 medium and ~9 small follicles for that stage, got blood drawn again to judge of 150 is to much, but I seemed ok (got a estradiol level of 656 - not sure what that means).

(Other forms of birth control were not an option, the pill etc. being out of bounds because of prior deep vein thrombosis and my uterus had already spontaneously expelled one IUD. Condoms were our only option.) 

&nbsp;

We decided to start trying in January 2015 (I had just turned 26, my husband 28), when I'd receive my teaching license. I remember how enthusiastic we were, and how paranoid I was about ""being caught"" when I went searching for fertility books in the library or was buying pregnancy tests or folic acid etc. Not getting pregnant on the first try was a bit of a disappointment, but hey, what would you expect? It's not because I was already armed with 2,5 years worth of cycle logs that we'd conceive on the first go, right? In our fourth cycle TTC, I started using OPK's. One set I bought myself, and the next month I got a big box of leftover tests from a friend who'd just given birth to her third son. By the time supply ran out (five cycles in total), I was at least pretty sure that my hormone levels were indicating ovulation, as were cervical mucus and cervical positions etc. Buying more tests seemed like a waste of money, I knew the physical signs now, I just wanted to confirm if I actually did ovulate. You know, maybe my body just geared up for it all, and then just didn't? I started temping, did that for another five and a half months (I gave up on that when I got pretty high fever for a couple of days during my fertile window. It was bothersome and clearly not helping.)

&nbsp;

As we were nearing the one year of trying mark, I did my research about the various fertility clinics, both in the city we live and in the city I work, giving us a choice of five facilities. After some deliberation with a friend who'd finally gotten pregnant on her sixth go of IVF, we decided on the university hospital in our place of residence and booked a first appointment. First availability was another three months! :O But we wanted the best hospital, and you know, ""it's bound to happen now, right? We'll get to cancel that appointment"". Well, nope, but one can hope!

&nbsp;

At the first appointment, my husband's SA was pretty fucking terrible: sperm count was about a third of what it should be, motility and morphology both about half. IVF numbers, but they'd have to be reconfirmed and he'd need an urological exam, because there might just be an operable cause for the bad sperm count. They also took fourteen vials of blood from me, because of complex (familial & personal) medical history. There'd be a lot to check out.

&nbsp;

On Thursday, we had our repeat appointment. My husband's second SA showed slightly better numbers, but they were still depressing. The urological exam hadn't found any physical problem that could explain the bad result, so there's no easy surgery to be had. No hope of getting pregnant from simple sex. On top of that, my blood work had come back. A couple of good points: my thyroid is working perfectly, no rheumatoid factor, no scary diseases that would bar fertility treatments, majority of hormone levels were okay. AMH slightly on the low side (slightly to be expected, as my mother entered menopause early!) but not worrisome. A factor for thrombosis was detected, also expected as I have had a deep vein thrombosis in 2013. I'll have to take aspirin during the treatment and potential pregnancy, maybe I'll need to get heparin injections too once I'm pregnant. The presence of that factor also affects my body's ability to absorb folic acid and B-vitamins, so I have to take a higher dosage of folate (tenfold the normal dose!) and I've been given vitamin B supplements. Finally, there was a special result concerning my immunity: every woman has a natural immune system response to semen protein. The body fights to keep intruders out. That factor should be around 40% at the max, but I have an overachieving immune system, and it scored 81%.

&nbsp;

Put it this way: every month, I ovulate nicely, and there's a little ovum at the top of one of my fallopian tubes, waiting for her perfect match. An army of sperm is supposed to try and travel all the way up there, and many, many would be lost even in the best of circumstances. Only the invading army is anything but a horde of elite troops, it's more like a small band of civilians that have been forced to enlist. There's too few of them to really be effective, and they're in subpar shape, lazy and malformed. They are sent on the journey either way, but they're not facing a small band of Orcs and Goblins along the way, no they're up against a huge regiment of battle trained Uruk-Hai. Even the elite troops would have only a slim chance of succeeding, but this band of soldiers has no hope. Were one to manage to join the egg, their union would most likely be discovered and ripped apart before they'd manage to make a burrow deep in the fertile soil.

&nbsp;

Yep, it's pretty dramatic. I did get compliments on a very thick, fertile uterine lining last time, so that's a plus. Everything they've discovered on my side is treatable, I'll be given some corticosteroids to suppress my immunity after the embryo transplant, I've got my ten-times higher than normal vitamin supplementation, there's the aspirin, etc. It'll be even more medication than IVF already is, but who gives a hoot? We've got one month now for the paperwork etc, and for my vitamin levels to build up, and we'll be starting IVF next cycle. (End of May, beginning of June). Thank goodness we live in Belgium where health insurance covers six cycles of IVF, so we don't have to worry about the financial burden, but we can just start treatment.

&nbsp;

That said: the mood swings are already in full effect before even the first dosage of hormones. I'm hopeful now, but at the same time it is really fucking scary to have hope again. I've had hope so many times in the past, and it got crushed and crushed and crushed again, and I don't dare to hope. But I believe in modern medicine and science and I think we do have reason to have hope again, but it's scary. So scary.

When I woke up, the doctor told me that they were only able to get 4 eggs and that she had been hoping for more (yeah, me too. thanks). She says that the other follicles were most likely cystic, which is why they didn't produce any eggs. 

The embryologist called this morning and said that only 2 of the eggs were mature enough to fertilize. Now, we wait. We'll get a call on Thursday to let us know if they are strong enough to biopsy and freeze. 

For the first time, my husband showed some emotion. I've been telling him this whole time that it's very possible we won't have any embryos and that this whole thing may not work.

My fertility treatments are being done out of town so I had to make my appointment and book my plane ticket without knowing for sure if I would start my period in time to be in the right part of my cycle. 

Thankfully I started today and will be on cycle day 11 for the test. I don't think I've ever been this excited for a period to start before, I almost wanted to cheer lol. 

My question about birth control is what time of day should I take it? Background on my birth control experiences, I took birth control on and off for about 2.5 years when I was 16-18 and had no side effects. When I was put on birth control for my last SIS (25 years old and 2 years ago) it gave me a constant migraine for 2 weeks before they pinpointed the cause and switched me to a lower estrogen pill. I still got some headaches but not migraines and not constant (I took these at night). I didn't have any reaction to the estrogen patches during IVF so I'm not positive it was the estrogen in the pill.

<p>My question about birth control is what time of day should I take it? Background on my birth control experiences, I took birth control on and off for about 2.5 years when I was 16-18 and had no side effects. When I was put on birth control for my last SIS (25 years old and 2 years ago) it gave me a constant migraine for 2 weeks before they pinpointed the cause and switched me to a lower estrogen pill. I still got some headaches but not migraines and not constant (I took these at night). I didn&#39;t have any reaction to the estrogen patches during IVF so I&#39;m not positive it was the estrogen in the pill. </p>

This week is National Infertility Awareness Week (‪#‎NIAW‬) and the theme for this year is ‪#‎startasking‬. I'm not sure I love the hashtag because there are lots of things not to ask when it comes to fertility (e.g., why don't you have kids? When are you planning to have kids? What about a sibling for your child? Whose fault is it? Why don't you just adopt?), and certainly don't go up to a stranger and ask about her womb. However, the logic is that the experience of going through infertility won't improve unless we start talking about it. As a society, we need to start talking about infertility even though, and especially because, it's an uncomfortable topic. It's uncomfortable because it's taboo, because it's not normal to talk about it, and because people don't know what to say.

Every day, I see someone on Facebook announce a pregnancy or a birth, which is super exciting and wonderful. However, like other things people share on social media, we only post about the good. What we don't see is what it may have taken that couple to get to the point of making that beautiful Facebook post. 1 in 8 couples struggle with infertility. That's A LOT of people! Chances are, many of these posts you see on Facebook are from couples that went through this struggle. Even when couples get to the point of announcing their good news on Facebook, it doesn't mean their struggles are over; they can still feel the sting when others post their announcements or talk about spacing their kids 2 years apart from each other (because it's not something everyone can choose or control), and they worry about what it's going to be like when they try to further grow their family. Unfortunately, because no one shares this information, infertility is incredibly isolating. It can feel like you're the only one not getting pregnant, like no one in your network understands your pain, like you are less of a woman (or man) than everyone else. When 1 in 8 couples struggle with infertility, it's mind boggling that we all still feel so alone.

Everyone going through infertility is different, and some may not want to share, which is okay. What's not okay is when people don't share because they feel like they can't, or that they won't be supported. It is an incredibly emotional journey, and I hope you'll accept the challenge to #startasking with compassion and understanding.

All this being said, it's important to talk more openly about infertility, but I'd advise you to follow some general guidelines about how to talk about it. Saying the wrong thing, even with good intentions, can make someone retreat into isolation and prevent them from sharing again. You may be surprised that something you think is comforting and helpful actually comes off as insensitive or hurtful- I didn't realize this until it affected me. Unless you're a medical professional (a Reproductive Endocrinologist in particular), there's nothing you can do or say to make infertility go away, so my best advice is to not try and offer suggestions or anecdotes about what might help. There aren't hard or fast rules about how to talk to someone who is struggling with infertility, but here are some general guidelines that can help tremendously (and a hug goes a long way).

Next week there will be lots of posts about Mother's Day, but this week, it's National Infertility Awareness Week. I know it's uncomfortable. Ask anyway. Talk about it. Learn what you can. Don't avoid it. #startasking #niaw ‪#‎1in8‬

Even when couples get to the point of announcing their good news on Facebook, it doesn&#39;t mean their struggles are over; they can still feel the sting when others post their announcements or talk about spacing their kids 2 years apart from each other (because it&#39;s not something everyone can choose or control), and they worry about what it&#39;s going to be like when they try to further grow their family. Unfortunately, because no one shares this information, infertility is incredibly isolating. It can feel like you&#39;re the only one not getting pregnant, like no one in your network understands your pain, like you are less of a woman (or man) than everyone else. When 1 in 8 couples struggle with infertility, it&#39;s mind boggling that we all still feel so alone.</p>

<p>Everyone going through infertility is different, and some may not want to share, which is okay. What&#39;s not okay is when people don&#39;t share because they feel like they can&#39;t, or that they won&#39;t be supported. It is an incredibly emotional journey, and I hope you&#39;ll accept the challenge to #startasking with compassion and understanding.</p>

<p>All this being said, it&#39;s important to talk more openly about infertility, but I&#39;d advise you to follow some general guidelines about how to talk about it. Saying the wrong thing, even with good intentions, can make someone retreat into isolation and prevent them from sharing again. You may be surprised that something you think is comforting and helpful actually comes off as insensitive or hurtful- I didn&#39;t realize this until it affected me. Unless you&#39;re a medical professional (a Reproductive Endocrinologist in particular), there&#39;s nothing you can do or say to make infertility go away, so my best advice is to not try and offer suggestions or anecdotes about what might help. There aren&#39;t hard or fast rules about how to talk to someone who is struggling with infertility, but here are some general guidelines that can help tremendously (and a hug goes a long way).</p>

<p>Next week there will be lots of posts about Mother&#39;s Day, but this week, it&#39;s National Infertility Awareness Week. I know it&#39;s uncomfortable. Ask anyway. Talk about it. Learn what you can. Don&#39;t avoid it. #startasking #niaw ‪#‎1in8‬</p>

My mother came over to our house to drop off a card my grandpa had asked her deliver and when I asked how it went she broke down a little bit and explained how difficult it was to see her brother and sisters with their grandchildren. I should back up a bit and explain one of my unmarried cousins moved back to his hometown a couple of months ago because he thought his girlfriend was pregnant. Well she wasn't. So she was actively trying to get pregnant to get him to stay in their hometown. Whatever. I think its stupid considering they aren't married, living with his parents and he barely just has a extremely part time job and she is 19(He is 24). I don't know where they are going to get money or insurance to take care of a child but whatever. Anyway, she just found out she IS pregnant and my aunt is over the moon that she is going to be a grandma. She is about 6 or 7 years younger than my mother so I can kind of see why she would be a little jealous.

Unfortunately, things got a little heated between her and my husband. I do see where she is coming from in her sadness and disappointment that she doesn't get to share role that her siblings do but I explained that we were doing all that we could. We have been ttcing for the past 5 1/2 years so trust me when I say WE ARE trying our hardest! She understood that but my husband was mad that she had come to the house to sulk and deliver the news about my cousin's girlfriend. I kind of understand his point as my sister had actually told me the week before so I had more time to process it.

I guess what I am trying to get to is, does anyone here help their parents deal with infertility? I am trying to search for a ""grandparents"" support group in town and haven't had any luck.

A bit of background: 31F was diagnosed with endo and cysts at age 13 with 6 surgeries since that time. Lost one pregnancy at 20 (didn't know I was pregnant) and another at 24 right after I married. This loss was devastating. I lost at 12 weeks and 5 days, after hearing the heartbeat. My husband (35M) and I went to the fertility clinic in 2012 where the usual endo etc was found on me, and sperm antibodies were found for him. This explained a lot. We were not able to pursue IUI as recommended at the time due to huge financial constraints. Husband was also convinced since we conceived before, we could again. Have just gone to the clinic for a second time and completed all of our testing. 

Here's my dilemma. The new semen-analysis showed no sperm antibodies, and his semen is completely normal. For myself, one tube is now blocked, and possible PCOS. My doctor wants to begin IUI at the end of May which we are super on board for......but the husband has been laid off since October. 400 resumes later and nothing. The economy in our location is horrific right now. We can't exactly afford to do this, but we also can't afford not to. I feel that i'm getting to an age where I am too old (yes I know i'm 31 not 41, but its how it feels) and I am constantly being bombarded with people who are pregnant on ""accident"" or ""it was so hard trying for 3 months"". I feel petty everyday for not being able to be wholeheartedly happy for my my friends or colleagues who are pregnant, and its like i'm never allowed to be sad. I'm also terrified. I'm terrified we will bring a baby into a less than ideal financial situation, terrified to lose another one (while there are 2 confirmed im pretty sure of 3 more), and terrified IUI wont work. Doesn't help that my husband's stance on our lost baby is to ""get over it"" because 6 years later I still commemorate the day we lost it, and my due date.

Lost one pregnancy at 20 (didn&#39;t know I was pregnant) and another at 24 right after I married. This loss was devastating. I lost at 12 weeks and 5 days, after hearing the heartbeat. My husband (35M) and I went to the fertility clinic in 2012 where the usual endo etc was found on me, and sperm antibodies were found for him. This explained a lot. We were not able to pursue IUI as recommended at the time due to huge financial constraints. Husband was also convinced since we conceived before, we could again. Have just gone to the clinic for a second time and completed all of our testing. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my dilemma. The new semen-analysis showed no sperm antibodies, and his semen is completely normal. For myself, one tube is now blocked, and possible PCOS. My doctor wants to begin IUI at the end of May which we are super on board for......but the husband has been laid off since October. 400 resumes later and nothing. The economy in our location is horrific right now. We can&#39;t exactly afford to do this, but we also can&#39;t afford not to. I feel that i&#39;m getting to an age where I am too old (yes I know i&#39;m 31 not 41, but its how it feels) and I am constantly being bombarded with people who are pregnant on &quot;accident&quot; or &quot;it was so hard trying for 3 months&quot;. I feel petty everyday for not being able to be wholeheartedly happy for my my friends or colleagues who are pregnant, and its like i&#39;m never allowed to be sad. I&#39;m also terrified. I&#39;m terrified we will bring a baby into a less than ideal financial situation, terrified to lose another one (while there are 2 confirmed im pretty sure of 3 more), and terrified IUI wont work. Doesn&#39;t help that my husband&#39;s stance on our lost baby is to &quot;get over it&quot; because 6 years later I still commemorate the day we lost it, and my due date. Don&#39;t know what I need but needed to get it out in a safe place.  </p>

My husband (39) has had several SAs, but I am not certain what his numbers are because they don't tell us and he isn't a big advocate for himself. I do know number and motility are average to low and his morphology is bad. I wasn't an advocate for myself either really until coming here and realizing all the things I should know but don't. 

Before the last IUI the neither the doctor nor the nurse told us we were supposed to have sex a couple days before the procedure. I thought the complete opposite that like with a pap or something you were supposed to abstain. So this time we tried, but my husband gets so anxious he can't get or maintain an erection. I know it is the anxiety of sex because he has been masturbating regularly. However, he does have low T which also complicates things. This is one reason I am feeling discourage. I feel like it will fail this time too because we don't didn't have sex. 

The other reason I feel discouraged has to do with my RE being an asshole. When I went in for her to monitor my follicle growth, I asked her if there was anything I could/should do to help make this IUI a success. She told me I to lose weight. This is the first time she has said this. I stared at her with a loss of words before finally stammering I can't really lose weight before Friday. It was just a shitty thing to say because it is impossible to do before this next IUI, and I just feel like I am too overweight for it to work.

280,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Thank you all for the amazing feedback yesterday in the daily. Here's what I currently have. Please let me know if anything is factually incorrect or sounds too snarky. I don't want to turn people off so I'm trying to make this a gentle, but firm blog post:


A few weeks ago, I posted a lengthy “coming out” about my infertility. I received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback. I’m lucky to be a person that has such an insanely amazing support system. There are women and men that feel utterly alone during this process - even isolated from their own significant other. It is such a stigmatized situation that they don’t feel comfortable sharing their problems and feel it will be dismissed by most of their friends, and even their family.

This being National Infertility Awareness week, and me being my oversharing, in-your-face, let-me-tell-you-how-I-feel-about-everything self, I’m going to share a few misconceptions about infertility. I don’t claim to be an expert - just another seemingly “perfectly healthy” person whose body doesn’t seem to know how to conceive a child.



1. “Infertility is caused by stress.” Infertility can cause a tremendous amount of stress, but stress does not cause infertility. One of the first things people are told when someone finds out a couple is struggling is to “just relax.” It’s the unfounded, unhelpful gift that just keeps giving. Often it doesn’t matter how many counter arguments a person gives - whether they are a woman who is in pre-menopause with limited egg reserve, a man with zero sperm count, or a couple who has some combination of symptoms - someone will still tell them that *relaxing* will be their cure. There’s not many other medical conditions (besides perhaps chronic stress or anxiety, and even those are generally treated with prescription medication) where a person is told to “relax” to fix a problem. When a person dealing with infertility hears this, they take it as a complete dismissal of their very physical problems. If I do anything else today, I hope that I will stop at least one person from ever uttering this to a person in fertility treatment ever again.

2. “Infertility is a woman's disease.” This simply isn’t true. Of infertile couples, 30% are due to female factor, 30% are due to male factor, and 30% are due to both individuals of a couple. There’s also couples who literally have “unexplained” infertility. On paper, everything looks “right,” but they still cannot conceive. This is why we need to break the stigma of discussing this subject - because even medical studies are limited. Just last night, I attended an AMA with two doctors who focus on male factor infertility. Despite being on the bleeding edge of infertility studies, their testing requires hundreds of thousands of sperm cells to test. This is not going to help couples who are dealing with male factor infertility where the counts are drastically lower. Additionally the tests are entirely unfeasible for women as even the most fertile of women would produce less than 75 follicles per cycle when stimulated. This is obviously nowhere near the threshold of *hundreds of thousands* of cells needed. The science just isn’t there for either sex.

3. “Fertility treatment always leads to multiples.” At its inception, fertility treatment did often lead to multiples. Originally with the medication that was prescribed women, would over-produce follicles (each which releases a single egg and can potentially split into multiples). Once a woman would ovulate, they would ovulate all of the mature follicles and then - voila - conception of multiples. Today, doctors take much higher precautions. They will cancel treatment if a woman is over (or under) responding. I personally have requested an increase in my treatment and my doctor has stated she does not want to move forward in that path because of my height/size. She has concerns that I would have a very high risk pregnancy if we were *too* successful. Multiples, particularly large sets (think quadruplets+) are very rare now in treatment. It's much more common for treatment to not work. Even in an IVF cycle where a woman is able to produce and retrieve multiple eggs often end up with none to implant.

4. “Fertility treatment = IVF.” Fertility treatment is not one size fits all. Those of us in treatment like to think of it as a slow climb up a high mountain. We take one step at a time and rule out potential causes through testing and incrementally more aggressive treatment. It starts with ensuring that a couple has all the necessary elements required for timed intercourse. A couple will have to try several cycles with monitoring and then move forward to IUI (insemination), then possibly IUI with injectables (shots for higher follicle count for the woman) or medication for men (to increase sperm count), and then finally IVF with some combination of drugs. Of course there are reasons why a couple would go straight to IVF - if they intend to use donor sperm/embryos, if there are male factor issues requiring surgery, if a woman has had previous ectopic pregnancies and lost her fallopian tubes and thus as no option but egg retrieval. The point here is that every single couple is slightly different, and there’s not a magic path to treatment or pregnancy. And all of these things take so. much. time. and can be easily halted. I’m currently “on the bench” because of a huge cyst on my right ovary. There is quite literally nothing I can do about it until my body resolves this on its own. It can be so time consuming and just plain frustrating. I have no idea how to describe it otherwise.

5. “Infertility only affects older couples or couples who just aren’t meant to be parents.” This is a particularly brutal line of thinking for a couple in fertility treatment. Modern medicine has brought us a long way from dying of the common cold or a simple infection. When you have a fever, do you just wait it out? If you had a major issue (cancer, heart disease) would you just “leave it to God/the Universe/chance”? I personally choose to believe that God did not personally coat my insides with endometriosis so that I could not bear children. I was not given PCOS or a hypoactive thyroid because I would be a terrible parent. I have a lot to offer as a mother and desperately want the gift of having a child. I choose to believe that there is not a higher power stopping me from doing so, and I hope that no one would would think such ill thoughts about me or anyone seeking fertility treatment.

6. “Adoption is an easy solution.” I touched on this a bit in my last post about being your own advocate with medical care. Domestic adoption in the US ranges from $15,000 to even $50,000. International adoption can be more cost effective, but it has its own hoops to jump through. Many countries (and even some US States) don't allow LGBT couples to adopt. Hell, some states won't even allow an unmarried couple to pursue IVF. If a couple *can* go through IVF, it is similarly expensive: base price without insurance is around $15,000 but quickly climbs to the $25,000 range. And this is for a single cycle - the first is typically diagnostic and often a 2nd, 3rd, 4th round of IVF is needed. Touching on point 4, IVF is not the same for everyone. Your baseline IVF procedure is limited medication and allowing “mother nature” to do its job in a petri dish instead of a human incubator. It increases from there. ICSI is where a medical professional literally picks out a single sperm and implants it into the egg. PGS testing is where they then scan for genetic anomalies to ensure they don’t implant a blastocyst (fertilized embryo) that will likely fail due to genetic factors that the body will essentially reject and miscarry. All of these extra tests are drastically more expensive. No road for a couple struggling with infertility is cheap or simple. They all require hard decisions and a huge amount of financial hardship.

7. “Infertility can always be fixed.”  Many people try to help by making suggestions: go to acupuncture, get drunk, go on vacation, stop drinking, cut out carbs, go vegetarian, stop drinking coffee, eat pineapple (the eat pineapple thing is not a joke - it is an old wives tale that regularly comes up). I assure you - anyone in fertility treatment has discussed their lifestyle with their doctor and asked if there is anything they should change. Any time they are put on new medication, their doctor is going to tell them exactly what the should and should not do with their diet and exercise. Furthermore, the serious issues infertile couples are dealing with likely *aren’t* going to change from a simple adjustment of their diet. Again, my endometriosis has nothing to do with what I eat or drink. I’ve also had a lot of friends tell me things like, “I know you’ll get pregnant when the time is right,” or, “it will happen when it’s supposed to happen.” Their hearts are in the right place, and I appreciate any support I receive. Sadly these are also statements that undercut the struggle I’m in and ignore the fact that I may not ever have children. A couple can statistically be a slam dunk in the infertility world and it just still. doesn’t. work.



So I’ve told you a lot of misconceptions here. If you’re still with me, thank you. And if you’re now asking yourself, “hey, CBE, you just told me everything *not* to do, but what can I do to support my friend who is struggling with infertility?” then you are already an awesome person. Here’s my best answer:

Listen. Ask them how they are feeling and see if they start to give you more details. Some days, they will want to talk about it (and maybe even give you a TMI level of detail about their reproductive health) and some days they won’t because it will just hurt too much to discuss. I know it can be tempting to say things like, “it will happen for you,” but try not to. Couples struggling are already dealing with so much of their own mental and emotional uncertainty, pressure from their families, and to be perfectly honest, envy when it seems everyone else around them is pregnant. They may not still have that same steadfast certainty that you do. They’ve been dealing with feeling broken for months or years or decades, and the change in your verbiage is very simple. Instead say, “I hope it will happen for you. I support you in your journey.” That’s all you have to do.

Me: It's okay. We have almost 8 nieces and nephews though.. my sister is due in June with her second. [Trying to deflect conversation off of myself.]
S: Haha, that's great. 8 nieces and nephews is enough kids for you, right? [with a little laugh]

The game goes on and I was relieved that I got out of that conversation unscathed. Then...

S: So, how long ago did you guys find out you couldn't have kids?
Me: After we'd be trying for a year, about a year ago, we were diagnosed with unexplained infertility. We had tests done, but they've all come back okay. We don't know why we can't have kids.

This is when the barrage of bingoes starts.

S: Well, I've heard that lots of people have kids if they just stop stressing about it. [Bingo #1].
Me: Yeah. Well this has been a hard process of getting hopes up and then being disappointed, so we're pretty much done trying. [this was my subtle way of saying SHUT UP]
S: You never know, maybe years down the line it'll just happen! [Bingo #2, riiiiight, because in several years I'll have better chances at that age???]
Me: Yeah. I think we're done.
S: Maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Maybe you're supposed to be a big part in other kids' lives. [Bingo #3]
Me: ......[incredulous at this point that this conversation just keeps going on...]
S: My daughter is 14 and she told me she never wants to have kids, but maybe she'll adopt. [Subtle Bingo #4]

I felt so incredibly downtrodden after this conversation. Why can't people just leave well enough alone? I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, that maybe they're just uneducated about it. Which they are to a large extent. Or maybe she just hasn't developed social graces. Or empathy. UGH.

My husband was super sweet. We went and got ice cream, because what's more American after a baseball game than getting ice cream from the local ice cream stand? and we end up in line between two pregnant people. He said, ""Do you want to eat in the car?"" And he also said, ""Sorry that conversation happened."" He gets it. 

Tl;dr Miss Helpy McHelperson (who I've also never met before) bingos me not once, but FOUR times in one conversation.

EDIT: Obviously the person downvoting this post doesn't get it either. Sad day.

I'm 27, Hubs is 29. Both healthy on the surface (although I'm a bit overweight) but after 6 months of trying, and due to family history, we made appts with an RE. 

I have history of Endometriosis. Grandmother tried 13 years, adopted 2 kids and then eventually had my mother. My mother had a D&amp;C at a youngish age. Then no issues conceiving both myself (I'm an oops!) and my brother. 

Through BBT and FF, everything seemed to be ok with my ovulation, but this last month went wonky. No clear temp shift, 2 weeks late, all negative tests, and they ended up giving me progesterone to jump start my next cycle. Also was given a low dose of synthroid to correct hypothyroidism. 

SA's have been abysmal at best. But they keep wanting to do more SA's. Not sure why. Low count and low motility. Dr. mentioned IUI but with the counts, IVF seems to be the most promising option.

I've only told immediate family, and I feel like I always have to put on a brave face in front of them.  But infertility sucks, and it hurts, and sometimes I don't feel hopeful.  It's nice to tell my story to others who get it. 

My husband and I tried for over a year when my general physician suggested I see a fertility specialist.  We went three days before Christmas 2014, and the doctor talked to us about all the reasons we might not be getting pregnant.  He suggested I do an HSG that day to rule out any issues with my tubes. He seemed confident everything would be fine, so I sent my husband back to work and went to the test later that afternoon. I knew something was wrong when I heard the doctor talking in hushed tones with the nurse. It turns out that both my tubes were blocked. My whole life changed that day. We later learned that it was due to a severe infection I had as a child (4 years old) after my appendix burst. Since then I have had two surgeries, first to try to open my tubes (didn't work) and then a second time to ligate my right tube because of a hydrosalpinx.

This will be an unmonitored IUI with Clomid, 100mg. I have never taken Clomid or any fertility drugs before and I am a bit nervous about the whole thing. 

Our problem is all MFI. I’m fine - I ovulate, HSG clear, AFC great, blood work fine except for a slightly cranky thyroid that is now under control. Husband has low but within normal ranges testosterone and a varicocele that is so small they do not want to fix it surgically. Varicocele likely from an unfortunate date with a bicycle cross bar in his late teens. Multiple SA show that he has good volume (around 3ml), low count (average 5.5 million post wash), good progressive motility (45%) and poor morphology (2%). They also tried to test him for antisperm antibodies but there were “too few motile sperm to check” and they couldn’t get a reading. 

I haven’t used any birth control other than the pull out method for many years (BCP made me a beyotch). We started to really try a couple years ago and I have never been pregnant.

Due to my age (almost 37) my RE wants me on Clomid to release 2 eggs for a higher chance of conceiving since I have good eggs right now. I’m worried I will end up with 3 or 4 (or more) follicles since I have no idea what my body will do on Clomid. Are my husband’s numbers so bad that I really don’t need to worry about ending up with triplets or should I push for monitoring? Has anyone had any issues with unmonitored medicated IUIs?

Any advice is much appreciated!

I had a consult today scheduled at 3:30 to review my upcoming salpingectomy. I got a call from my doctor at 11 AM saying that the doctor scheduled to perform my surgery - who has been with my practice basically since its inception 20 years ago - announced today that he will be leaving the practice.  I haven't the foggiest clue of what's ultimately behind this, although I imagine it's some sort of professional drama that I ought not to concern myself with.  My understanding is that this doctor may be moving on to be a solo practitioner or will be joining a new practice.  Either way, it put a wrench in my plans for a consult today, not to mention the actual surgery I'm supposed to have in three weeks.  My doc's voicemail simply said to call back and that we would reschedule the surgery ""as soon as possible"" with ""another surgeon."" 

W.

My some stroke of luck, I started a period over the weekend (a couple of days before I thought I would) and also needed to have a CD3 monitoring appointment scheduled today.  The doctor leaving the practice is always in on Mondays, and initially we were going to lump my monitoring appointment and the consult in together.  The consult got cancelled, but I was advised to keep my monitoring appointment on the books and still come in at 3:30 today for a blood draw and ultrasound.  I walked into the office nearly in tears unsure of what I was going to say to the doctor who I felt this morning was leaving me high and dry.  

It was a very lucky monitoring appointment.  Leaving-the-practice doc asked me how I was when he walked in, and I said, ""If I may be frank with you...I'm very worried about when or if I'll have this surgery now and on what time I'll ever get around to a frozen embryo transfer.  I'm really feeling like I've been through enough already...I'm so sorry for whatever's happening, but the news today had me very upset.""  Doc was super, super sympathetic.  

And he thinks that we may be able to finagle a few things and get me in next Thursday...two weeks *before* my surgery was initially scheduled.  

We also spoke with my doctor this afternoon, and she asked to keep her posted in case an update doesn't come through her inbox tomorrow from a scheduler or a nurse or whoever.  She promised that at the very latest I'll still have this surgery with someone on or before May 18.  ANYWAY.  

We did do a bit of a mini-consult while we were having a look at my ovaries on the dildo-cam.  Essentially, recovery will be pretty quick and doc thinks that if I wind up having surgery next Thursday, a long weekend off will be sufficient and I'll be back in action with my students by the following Monday!  The plan is absolutely to completely remove my diseased-or-whatever tubes, but that if there is significant scarring and my tubes are actually stuck to my ovaries we'll clip them instead to make sure ovarian tissue isn't damaged.  The discussion was very straightforward and reassuring - we just need to make this happen.

I walked into the office nearly in tears unsure of what I was going to say to the doctor who I felt this morning was leaving me high and dry.  </p>

<p>It was a very lucky monitoring appointment.  Leaving-the-practice doc asked me how I was when he walked in, and I said, &quot;If I may be frank with you...I&#39;m very worried about when or if I&#39;ll have this surgery now and on what time I&#39;ll ever get around to a frozen embryo transfer.  I&#39;m really feeling like I&#39;ve been through enough already...I&#39;m so sorry for whatever&#39;s happening, but the news today had me very upset.&quot;  Doc was super, super sympathetic.  </p>

<p>And he thinks that we may be able to finagle a few things and get me in next Thursday...two weeks <em>before</em> my surgery was initially scheduled.  </p>

<p>We also spoke with my doctor this afternoon, and she asked to keep her posted in case an update doesn&#39;t come through her inbox tomorrow from a scheduler or a nurse or whoever.  She promised that at the very latest I&#39;ll still have this surgery with someone on or before May 18.  ANYWAY.  </p>

<p>We did do a bit of a mini-consult while we were having a look at my ovaries on the dildo-cam.  Essentially, recovery will be pretty quick and doc thinks that if I wind up having surgery next Thursday, a long weekend off will be sufficient and I&#39;ll be back in action with my students by the following Monday!  The plan is absolutely to completely remove my diseased-or-whatever tubes, but that if there is significant scarring and my tubes are actually stuck to my ovaries we&#39;ll clip them instead to make sure ovarian tissue isn&#39;t damaged.  The discussion was very straightforward and reassuring - we just need to make this happen.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll update tomorrow with a when, a who, and a how for this thing...I hope! </p>

Question:  Before starting any treatment I used to get really sore breasts about 8 days past ovulation.  The last 3 months I have not had any sore breasts and I even been taking progesterone supplements.  After seeing follicle scans my guess was I was not ovulating before starting treatment.  Month one I did Clomid and got a follicle but tiny 17mm on CD21 so I'm not really sure I even ovulated so I guess I didn't think to much of it.  This last month I did Femara and got a beautiful 26mm follicle at day 14 and triggered and felt ovulation.  I was expecting sore breasts but again nothign even with progesterone supplements.  

Does anyone know why for like my whole life I'd have sore breasts 8dpo and now nothing.  I guess I always thought sore breasts were a good sign that things were semi working right.

Again all that's changed is:
- Metaformin
- Dexomethasone

I can't believe I just found this sub!  I'm a 31, almost 32f and my husband is 27. This June will be our fifth wedding anniversary, we've been trying to conceive on and off for 4.5 years.  

I knew I would likely have some difficulty,  my mother and grandmother struggled to conceive as well.  However,  I had always had normal paps and exams.  I thought it would take us a few months and then we would have our baby.  Boy was I wrong. 

 After about a year,  we sought help from my obgyn. After a few tests he prescribed me metformin,  believing I was insulin resistant. 6 months go by,  and nothing happens.  MD decides on a round of clomid. Nothing happens.  Around this time Husband and I decide to take a break.  6 months or so later we pick back up and I begin temping and what not.  5 months go by,  I again ask my obgyn, for something to help us.  He tells me that I need to be patient.  I decide to seek a second opinion.  My husband and I see a different obgyn and after a few more tests I'm diagnosed with PCOS. It was a difficult time.  We took a few months off and went on vacation.  Then we began trying again,  I took my temp,  ate the pineapple core,  used preseed. Went back on metformin,  tried clomid again.  Nothing.  Just nothing.  8 months go by,  I've done just about everything,  had more internal ultrasounds and tests than I can count and I'm suddenly diagnosed with unexplained infertility.  It felt like a slap in the face.  ""There's nothing medically wrong with you, but you can't conceive"", that's what my doctor told me.  Husband was upset,  but I don't think he was as devastated as I was.  I felt like a total and complete failure.

In January 2015 we became foster parents.  It has been a wild ride to go from no kids to two and our sex life took a real hit lol.  We continued to ""try"" without actively trying, but focused more on just being parents and enjoying our time together.  

It's now April of 2016. This past December my husband and I decided we would try again and this time we would go all out.  I made an appointment with the top rated infertility and ivf doctor in my area.  It was set for March 8th. I went,  he reviewed everything and prescribed me femara, metformin and a few vitamins. On April 14 I ovulated for the first time in years! I was so hopeful,  then I stayed my period yesterday.  

So back to the drawing board,  but my new doctor has office hours 6 days per week and is actively looking to portions to help us.  For the first time IUI and IVF are being considered for us.  To help our journey along,  my husbands and I each have lost 35+ pounds and quit smoking.

We have new data from 2014 that breaks things down differently than in the past and tries to look at the ""total reproductive potential"" of each woman from each egg retrieval, including fresh and frozen transfers.  While I think we've all looked at SART's website at least once or twice, previously data wasn't disaggregated in this way.  It's worth taking a new look at.  

Looking at the new numbers from my own doctor is pretty encouraging.  It's amazing how far technology can take us in just a few years.  

If you visit sart.org and click ""find a clinic,"" you can view statistics for the doctor your visit, as well as other clinics in your area and around the country.  You can also compare how your clinic compares with national averages.  Data is broken down by age group, fresh and frozen transfers, cumulative live birth rates...it's pretty interesting.  You can also input some statistical information about yourself, e.g. your age, height, weight, and infertility diagnoses, and see how likely IVF is to work for you.  

https://creatingafamily.org/infertility-category/understanding-the-new-fertility-clinic-success-statistics/ is a podcast that was posted to my clinic's Facebook page this week (and features one of my doctors!) that's helpful in understanding and interpreting this new data.

There is a new documentary about IVF called HAVEABABY. It follows two couples and a single woman as they go through IVF treatments and experience the emotional roller coaster of infertility. I am sure it will resonate with many of you. The film just premiered at Tribeca early this month and will be having its west coast premiere in SF with three showings this week. You can get tickets for those showings here: http://www.haveababymovie.com/?page_id=14939

The director has first-hand experience with the pains of infertility. She had three failed rounds of IVF and her husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer in the midst of their infertility treatment — all while she was in the middle of making this film.

If you are in the Bay Area, I strongly encourage you to check it out and/or let your friends and family know about the screenings.

* Thursday: E2 1200, 6 follicles (one leading @18, pack of smaller ones that were close but not all ready to trigger).

* Friday: E2 1100, all 6 follicles big enough to trigger, leading follicle probably overcooked. Took trigger shot, ganirelix, and follistim. Retrieval scheduled for Sunday.

* Sat: E2 600, thanks for playing goodbye.

The RE who called to break the news wasn't my usual RE, and I started crying and hung up before I could get him to explain what happened. He did say that we could still do a retrieval if we wanted, but that there probably wouldn't be any eggs so he didn't recommend we waste the money. 

I really have no idea what happened. Did I ovulate on Friday? Did the eggs just... die? What causes that? Was having a leading follicle part of the problem? What can we do differently next time?
