I was able to get pregnant naturally back in 2008 but it ended up in miscarriage around 6 weeks. Since then I never have any known pregnancy on my own. We started IVF last year. They retrieved 21 eggs and we ended with three 5 days and one 6 days blasts. I have PCOS but not full blown, meaning I have multiple cysts on my ovaries but my insulin and testosterone levels are normal.

I had OHSS after the egg retrieval so we couldn‚Äôt do a fresh transfer. My first FET was 3 months later. We transferred one embryo. At the 7 weeks ultrasound heartbeat was 80. The follow up ultrasound one week later showed no heartbeat at all. I took medication to let the miscarriage happen at 8 weeks. Our second FET was January this year. This one ended pretty early. First beta was low it was just over 100 and it was dropping. The doctor advised me to stop medication and then I miscarried. In our most recent FET we transferred the last two embryos. Beta was rising at a good rate. But our 7 weeks ultrasound yesterday showed a blighted ovum. There is nothing in there, no yolk sac, just nothing. I am sad, but I feel like I am getting numb. Maybe I feel better because we can move on to our next IVF, but at the same time I am pretty lost.

The clinic I currently go to is not willing to do more immunology tests for me. Dr said they did all the necessary tests and any others are not proven to be useful. Tests we have done so far were:

-cardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM)
-Lupus
-TSH
-APS

These all came back normal. He said going forward we should do PGS/PGT on the embryos to make sure they are normal. If that doesn‚Äôt work then I may need to look at surrogacy. 

I am very hesitant in doing my next IVF with this clinic again because I think I will end up with the same results. I don‚Äôt think what happened to us were just having ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù. There is a problem with my body, but I just haven‚Äôt find out what it is. I am now considering other clinics in Canada and maybe abroad. I have heard good things about the fertility clinic in Victoria and Olive in Vancouver. Does anyone know how they treat RPL and their views on reproductive immunology? I am not sure if a clinic within Canada will just provide similar experience as my current one.

  Down the road, the ""hope"" of surrogacy makes my hair fall out when thinking about the costs, upwards of 100K.  She is a middle school teacher, and I work in logistics and don't even make $20 an hour.  That's just not possible, no way we are taking a mortgage out on our kid and paying loans on it our whole life.  That's crazy.

We have had a couple friends and family members come up to us and tell us they will be a carrier in a heartbeat.  Family members are kind of out of the picture as to many reasons, one being the family member somehow expecting us to forever be in their debt or something and just causing problems down the road if anything ever comes up in a family argument or some crap. I have enough family resentments as it is.

Anyways, to the point.  Does anyone have any experience or know anyone who has used a friend as a carrier and the costs with the insurance premiums for them and everything else?  Realistically we would be able to muster up around 20K at the most.

When I try to research I can never find a number.  It's nothing but surrogate websites and agencies and loans etc. and every article I read doesn't have a single number other than the number for agencies and hired surrogates, it's actually incredibly frustrating.

How much would one expect to pay when having a friend as a surrogate, assuming their insurance doesn't cover them to be a gestational carrier.  Sometimes looking at premiums it sounds like it would cost less paying for it out of pocket as insurance is outrageous.  Anyways, any numbers or experience would be much appreciated.  Thanks

EDIT: I don‚Äôt need cost of IVF.  Meds, Harvest, Egg storage etc $4,500.  They cut the price for us.

I am concerned about their actual level of care.  I am also concerned about the legal process of bringing a foriegn born child back to the US as a citizen.  I am also concerned about the act of flying a newborn back to the US on an long flight.  Has anyone tried this?</p>

53,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Cross-posted from r/IFagain

I am in a tough spot. After 3 failed IUIs, and a failed IVF, we did a second IVF with a new doctor at our same clinic and had success. When trying for a second, we used up our remaining embryos (2 FETs, both failed), did a new IVF with the same protocol that had previously worked, got 3 day-5s, and they all failed. I have DOR, my husband has 2-3% morphology, but our multiple failures are largely unexplained. We are both 37 and were 34 when we had success. We are now 1 for 8 transfers. No uterine problems, RLP is negative, thyroid normal. Have not done PGS before, but will in the future.

Our conundrum is that our current doctor thinks we should do fewer stims‚Äîour second (successful) cycle has fewer stims than our first (failed) cycle. Our most recent cycle got 3 day-5s (one more than successful cycle) with the same drugs, but follicle growth was asynchronous‚Äîthey thought they might end up ‚Äúmissing‚Äù a bunch of the follicles because they were such different sizes.  She thinks that overstimulation can make good eggs bad.

We got a second opinion from CCRM and they think we should do the opposite‚Äîmore stims. They think that we have a DNA problem and the more eggs we get the better, so we can test them all and transfer the good ones. They think that you can‚Äôt make good eggs bad with overstimulation, unless you get to the point of OHSS, which would never happen for me because I get like 10-12 eggs.

<p>I am in a tough spot. After 3 failed IUIs, and a failed IVF, we did a second IVF with a new doctor at our same clinic and had success. When trying for a second, we used up our remaining embryos (2 FETs, both failed), did a new IVF with the same protocol that had previously worked, got 3 day-5s, and they all failed. I have DOR, my husband has 2-3% morphology, but our multiple failures are largely unexplained. We are both 37 and were 34 when we had success. We are now 1 for 8 transfers. No uterine problems, RLP is negative, thyroid normal. Have not done PGS before, but will in the future.</p>

<p>Our conundrum is that our current doctor thinks we should do fewer stims‚Äîour second (successful) cycle has fewer stims than our first (failed) cycle. Our most recent cycle got 3 day-5s (one more than successful cycle) with the same drugs, but follicle growth was asynchronous‚Äîthey thought they might end up ‚Äúmissing‚Äù a bunch of the follicles because they were such different sizes.  She thinks that overstimulation can make good eggs bad.</p>

<p>We got a second opinion from CCRM and they think we should do the opposite‚Äîmore stims. They think that we have a DNA problem and the more eggs we get the better, so we can test them all and transfer the good ones. They think that you can‚Äôt make good eggs bad with overstimulation, unless you get to the point of OHSS, which would never happen for me because I get like 10-12 eggs.</p>

My name is Eva Gabor and I am a graduate student receiving my Master's degree in Genetic Counseling at California State University, Stanislaus. I am about to begin conducting a research study that seeks to learn more about the perspectives of people who have received mosaic results after using PGT-A (preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy) with IVF and have made decisions about transferring those embryos. The ultimate goal of the study is to improve the practices of genetic counselors and other providers who advise individuals about mosaic embryo transfer. 

The study consists of a 30-45 minute interview that includes questions about one's experiences and opinions surrounding mosaic embryo transfer. Currently, I am looking to run a few test interviews with some volunteers in order to practice my research protocol. Participants will ideally have received mosaic PGT-A results and considered transferring them. 

This study is IRB (protocol #1920-020) and mod-approved.

This discussion is not to imply these resolutions are the right fit for every person or family or that these solutions are simple, easy, or obvious.  This is also not to imply that these discussions are limited to this thread, but an effort to carve out a unique space for individuals to collaborate, commiserate, and learn.
We are approaching this thread with a slightly relaxed approach to ongoing ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù as the foster/adopt scenario is a tricky situation.

After much discussion, we decided to move ahead with a sperm donor. Suddenly everything got very real very quickly!

I went in for the saline infused sonogram (SIS) Monday morning and it was so painful I started sobbing as soon as the doctor left the room. It hurt ALL DAY and I had the hysterosalpingogram (HSG) about four and a half hours later. It hurt just as bad we actually had to stop halfway through and give my uterus a break, letting some of the dye run out, before starting again. Needless to say after all of that pain the X-ray didn't even show my fallopian tubes. The test is technically considered ""inconclusive,"" but the doctor performing the procedure said my tubes could either have been clenched so tightly from the pain that they wouldn't open OR they are both occluded (blocked). We have our follow-up with our fertility doctor next Friday. I have a few questions - I'm the kind of planner who feels settled knowing ahead of time what decisions will be made depending on the obstacle. 

Has anyone had this happen to them, where the tubes didn't show up on the X-ray but they weren't occluded?

If your tubes were occluded, what did you do?

Finally, the biggest concern for me is that my only solution is IVF which scares the living daylights out of me. Not only because of the pain, but also because I'm very concerned about the tolls on my mental health. I have anxiety and have been through severe depression, and I don't want to go back to those spaces. If you've done IVF, can you speak to your experience with the hormones and your mental health?

I'm sharing where we're at in our process today, to hopefully get some feedback from the members of this community who have so much information and experience to share.  Thanks in advance for your help!

I am 34 and my husband is 29. At my last annual GYN appointment, I asked the NP how long we should try before seeking help - since I'll be 35 soon - and she recommended 8 months. So, for the last 8 months I've done temping and OPKs, and have ovulated every month. 

We started testing now that we're in cycle 9.  All of my blood work (fertility panel and progesterone) have been normal. I had an HSG which was also normal. Our doctor (a GYN MD) told us that my husband's SA was ""normal with slight motility problems.""  We got a copy of the report today, and I'd say it doesn't look good.  Volume and count were normal (5.2 and 43 mil/mL), however morphology was 4%, and progressive motility was only 3%. These numbers both seems quite discouraging to me.

As a next step, our doctor is recommending a post-coital test, which I can find out very little about, and it seems to be an outdated and inaccurate test.  If we don't want to do this, he's recommending a sperm antibody blood test, and then possibly IUI. The IUI they do at this office is no washing to the sperm, and done with no medications or monitoring. We are going to try and get a second opinion from a fertility clinic soon.

What do you all think of this plan? Any suggestions? Do we stand a chance of getting pregnant with these SA results without some kind of more invasive procedure?

We have been struggling with infertility for the past 2 years. We initially started trying Jan 2018 and got our first positive test in June 2018 which unfortunately ended in a MMC after a long struggle with Q48 hour betas in the setting of pregnancy of unknown location. I had a D&E on 7/10/18, didn't get my period again until late October and that had to be brought on by Provera. 3 months later we had another positive test which unfortunately ended in another loss in early Jan. My cycles were weird and irregular and my regular OB put my on femara for 3 months to see if that would help and it didn't so we went to REI last month. Since that time I have learned A LOT of overwhelming information. My husband's SA is pretty much perfect except morphology a little low at 10% but with high overall counts. Both our Karyotypes are normal. I had a normal screen for bleeding/clotting disorders, no diabetes, normal TSH, good AMH at 3.67, AFC of 11 despite one big cyst obstructing view of my right ovary. I went in for an HSG and there was no flow through my right tube and a large filling defect. Given the large filling defect I had a hysteroscopy yesterday, my REI was expecting to find a big polyp but found intrauterine adhesions, likely related to my D&E last year.

Hello Everyone,

I am new to this thread. I am 35 and my husband is 41. We have been trying to conceive for almost 2 years now. My husband had a recurrent varicocele that he had surgery to repair January of this year. We assumed things would be moving along after things improved. His count had greatly improved in April so we were very hopeful. It's now October and we still haven't had any luck. We haven't done anything too invasive (aside from the surgery of course) and have tried Letrozol several times as I responded well to that drug.

I met with my doctor again recently and she ordered an HSG ( Hysterosalpingography ). I'm curious if anyone has experience with one of these and would know what to expect? This journey has been difficult with ups and downs and currently I am very down. I think I am nervous about what this test is going to show. I appreciate any advice on this subject.

We've gone through 3 cycles with our current clinic and they haven't really changed our protocol much, and we're wondering how to start lining up a second opinion with a doctor who  understands the desires of couples who still want to try for a child that's their own genetically for a while longer and are willing to experiment w/ different protocols. (we just saw one yesterday who pretty much ignored my husband and told me to go straight to donor w/ even asking us what our financial/emotional/physical limits or preferences were, wtf is it w/ men telling women what to do with their body?!)

IVF 1

* protocol: antagonist w/ max dosage gonal-F and menopur, trigger ovidrel and lupron
* stimmed 9 days; E2 980 day after trigger
* 3 follicles (2 19-24mm); 3 retrieved; 3 fertilized w/ ICSI; 2 day5 blasts both aneuploid

IVF 2

* protocol: same w/ estrogen priming & clomid
* stimmed 13 days; E2 1076
* 5 follicles (3 17-20mm); 5 retrieved; 4 mature; 0 fertilized w/ ICSI

IVF 3

* protocol: same w/ clomid (no estrogen priming since this immediately followed IVF2)
* stimmed 11 days; E2 1961
* 8 follicles (5 17-22mm); 3 retrieved; 2 mature; 1 fertilized w/ ICSI (currently waiting on results for this lone embryo!)

Sad that my follicle count is going up (I'm now taking DHEA, CoQ10 and a load of supplements) but the egg quality is going down? I'm wondering if maybe we triggered too late for cycle 3? Will micro-flare help?

At our six month mark of our TTC journey the SIL announced she was pregnant to us at 5.5weeks. This is someone who as long as i can remember say that we would have kids ‚Äúlong before‚Äù her. We‚Äôve had a not so great relationship over the years, and we were actually doing quite well before the announcement. 

About a year ago and we had her and her partner over for Father‚Äôs Day with my FIL and I saw her bump and it just triggered me. It took me weeks to get it out of my mind and stop being anxious about seeing it. I have since avoided her. I should mention because of past instances she is a trigger for my anxiety. 

When the baby was born in January I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to message her to say congrats (we didn‚Äôt really have that kind of relationship anyway) and I logged off Facebook before the baby was born (partly because I couldn‚Äôt handle seeing the announcement as well as all of the other baby announcements happening every day) My anxiety was sky high and I was just doing my best to get out of the dark hole I was in. TTC jealousy had taken over more than ever. 

Months and months went by and I kept avoiding (she lives about 1.5 hours away so never really had to see her) 

Then my father in law got sick the other week. I finally had to see her and her baby.. they walked into his cubicle in the ER and didn‚Äôt even look at me for the 5 minutes we shared the space. It went on and I think she visited around the time we were visiting. Not to mention I was so anxious about seeing them. 

Today we went to her house (they moved in sometime earlier this year after the baby was born) to pick up the father in law. I brought her flowers to congratulate her on her new house.

She said she appreciated it but mentioned three times that her partner was more upset than her, that I hadn‚Äôt acknowledged their daughter. I kept saying I was sorry and to be honest I don‚Äôt even know what else I said because it‚Äôs a blur. 

But I did it! I was brave and stepped up and faced my anxiety. I wish I felt more relieved that it‚Äôs done.. but now I need to apologise to him as well. She mentioned something like he doesnt understand to which I said a lot of people don‚Äôt understand. Maybe he would get it if I said ‚Äúimagine if you were still trying to get pregnant with the baby you already have‚Äù?

132,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"    This journey, if that‚Äôs what I should call it, has been the most treacherous, unforgiving, and unknown road I will ever NOT understand. I grew up not knowing how fleeting life could be nor how much of a miracle it is to actually create another being. I am writing this as I lose my 9 week old little angel, to shed light for others struggling or knowing someone struggling through this unforgiving path. We are not alone! Here is our story:
    In the beginning we just tried, like rabbits, and it was fun for a while. We had no idea what we were in for in the beginning of this journey.  After 5 years of trying naturally, we became pregnant. But my body immediately knew something was indefinitely wrong. It was an ectopic pregnancy, the blastocyst connected to the outside of an ovary. After that loss, I became numb, full of hate, and carried a sense of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù with me for many months. It was a dark time.
    As the months went by, my husband and I tried to see the glass half full. We realized, we can actually get pregnant. We just have to get it in the right spot! So we resorted to infertility treatments. Hopes high, pockets deep, we jumped in head-first with all the optimism imaginable! 
    After somewhere around 6-8 rounds of chlomid, which I was highly allergic to, trigger shots, cervix opening procedures, progesterone, estrogen, IUIs, and the ‚Äúlovely math game‚Äù to no avail, we found it exhausting. And needed a break from it all after only 1 year! We felt defeated, unworthy, and alone. 
    As I got back on the horse, after a few months break, we turned to letrozole. It was, for me, a better medication compared to chlomid. No blisters engulfing my tongue, nor hives covering my body. Again, with high hopes, deep pockets, and a shared sense of ‚Äúthis was going to be it!‚Äù We again tried for somewhere around 4-6 times, playing the ‚Äúmath game‚Äù. Nothing, just period after period. So many wasted pregnancy tests, ovulation kits, and time spent tracking everything. Hopes so high we could almost always see that second line, which was never there. 
   Again, ready to give up, I started blindly searching the web for answers. This is when I came across a miraculous doctor, a specialist that would help me in ways I didn‚Äôt think possible. The doctor‚Äôs title: Advanced Procreative Gynecological and Reproductive Specialist. I made an appointment and we went over all my history.
    I was looking to this doctor for the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and boy oh boy did she have some answers. First, she ordered a complete blood panel and recommended a laparoscopic procedure to ‚Äútake a look‚Äù inside in order to see what could be going on. The doctor suspected endometriosis, which can only be determined by going in, and we agreed with this investigation. 
    Now, with a paused sense of trying to conceive, we began looking for answers. With that 1st diagnostic laparoscopy the doctor found a multitude of ailments. Endometriosis, polyps blocking the pathway from my ovaries to my fallopian tubes, PCOS with massive clusters of cysts covering my ovaries, and a collapsed tube that was fused to my pelvis. 
    This doctor had no idea how I hadn‚Äôt been complaining about severe pain for years. I told her, I‚Äôve always had extreme pain, but thought it was normal. I knew no difference. She then scheduled 2 more robotic laparoscopic surgeries, where she vowed to laser off all of the endometriosis, remove the polyps, peel the cystic PCOS tissue away from each ovary, stitch it off, and repair my fused and collapsed tube. 
    At this point, it had been roughly 3 years into fertility treatments and 5 years of naturally trying. We were plummeting through a 7 year tunnel to see not a glimpse of light and no end. I felt that I had been waisting our money. A sense of guilt swept over me, that ‚ÄúI was the problem‚Äù.  But in time, I regained my faith and strength. My husband helped me realized we had to go through what we did in order to figure all of this out. 
   This doctor has been our miracle! She fixed all these ailments. I did have complications, such as reactions to medications used, because you see, using fertility medications for multiple rounds creates allergies within your body. I have developed so many new allergies, I can‚Äôt even use soap!  Please beware! I know that all of us will do anything for the chance, but it will take a toll on our body‚Äôs. 
    After my surgeries, I proved to have a strength within me I had no idea about! It was scary, painful, and my body had reactions that no one could ever imagine! (Like a reaction I can only compare to elephantiasis of my vagina, because of a reaction to blue dye used during a Hysterosalpignogram. I literally thought I was growing my own penis at one point. It was horrendous!) 
   With the healing complete, we gave everything a rest again. We tried 3 months to naturally conceive, with no results. I turned to letrozole yet again and used it for 3 cycles, this time at 5 pills in one dose. Nothing! My husband and I had a very serious talk about grief, love, and how our plan may just not involve a child of our own. We decided  to completely stop trying. To try and remember our youth and what having sex for fun was like. 
   Just as I gave up all hope at my chance of ever becoming a mother. A miracle happened. We naturally became pregnant! We couldn‚Äôt believe it! I took at least 5 or more tests, all positive. Immediately, we called the specialist and she confirmed with an ultrasound a baby at 6 weeks, beautiful placement, and a heartbeat of 150bpm.
    Yet, as I sit here today a little over 9 weeks my heart bleeds, as do I. We have had the miracle of a chance and for unknown reasons our baby‚Äôs heart stopped beating. Now, all that familiar grief and pain is swallowing us up again. The roller coaster feels like it‚Äôs gone off the tracks! 
    What am I supposed to be learning? What more amount of strength can I possibly gain? I must un-tell everyone again. Delete the baby registry we began making. This hit us so hard! We truly believed this was it! I know I will regain my strength, and this too shall pass. I also understand I am not alone. 
    Please, If you‚Äôve been able to experience the miracle of creating a healthy life, never take it for granted! So many of us struggle every day. We go unnoticed, inconsolable, and oftentimes lose ourselves within the emotional and physical pain.

My husband and I just went through with a donor but only retrieved one viable egg. We spent a really big chunk of our savings on this and can‚Äôt afford another round. I am now feeling down that we have only one chance at a transfer. We should feel lucky to have even a chance at a transfer but all I can feel is hopelessness. We are hoping for the best but planning for the worst. 

Every waking minute I think about it and every time I think about it I get sadder and sadder. There are moments throughout the day that I am focused on something else and for those few minutes I am free from the circumstances and realities of life. I live for those moments. 

And now several of my friends not only have kids but are pregnant with their second and third. Yesterday I saw my friend who has a kid. It‚Äôs been about 6 months since I saw her last and she was visibly pregnant. She casually said they were expecting and we all wished her congratulations. Naturally we discussed what it‚Äôs been like for her. We were in a group celebrating a friend‚Äôs birthday so I put on my best face of joy. I was doing all I could to hold back my tears.

Since my diagnosis I have generally avoided being around people with kids but it‚Äôs not entirely avoidable.

204,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,

So we had our 2nd round of IVF, a frozen transfer around mid July. We did get a positive pregnancy test, the first beta hcg seemed ok but the 2nd had not doubled by 48 hours. We were advised to stop all meds and told it was a miscarriage. 

After this call our clinic did not follow up any further. Towards the end of August my wife called as her bleeding had not stopped since the start of the 2nd week of August. The staff said this is normal and were not concerned.

The bleeding continued into early September, where my wife called again and was told that it will last for 6 weeks. Again nursing staff not concerned.

We had booked in a scan via another healthcare provider which happened towards the end of Sept which showed an abnormality near the ovary.  They had scheduled in another scan.

This time my wife lied her way to get an appointment with the fertility clinic to which they eventually agreed to perform another scan.

This happened a couple days after the abnormality was reported, it turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy. My wife had been carrying this in her tube for 11 weeks, showing no signs of pain and the only symptoms to be bleeding. Sadly, she had to undergo emergency surgery (at a separate early pregnancy unit) and lost one of her tubes.

I know with IVF there is an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy and you go with it. However, surely the fertility clinic should have some process for aftercare instead of stopping all contact after reporting our pregnancy was failing.

Do I have genuine grounds to make a complaint here? Was our clinic negligent towards my wife?

They only took her seriously after she lied her way to an appointment, even then we had to do some of the ground work ourselves via the alternative healthcare provider who spotted the initial issue. 

Since discovering the ectopic pregnancy, the fertility clinic have called twice as a ""courtesy call"", I wonder if they feel they really messed up here.

We have 4 embryo's left, I am worried if I make a complaint then somehow we are putting those 4 embryos at risk from being given the proper chance for future cycles.

Thanks in advance.

216,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi r/infertility, long-time, first-time. As my post title states, I'm a 33-year-old woman with Fragile X premutation (\~100 repeats). My husband and I started trying to conceive just after I turned 31, and after 6 months ended up in fertility treatment because I had a gut feeling something was wrong. Testing revealed that I had M√ºllerian abnormalities (either bicornuate uterus or uterus didelphys, jury's still out on that one; 1 kidney; and a uterine septum, since removed via laparoscopy) + low AMH/ high day-3 FSH + the Fragile X premutation which probably explains the DOR.

The genetic counselor explained that I had a 50% chance of passing on my Fragile X gene to a baby, and because of my high number of repeats, they would expand in the fetus and the baby would with 99%+ probability have full-blown Fragile X syndrome. So PGS + PGD are a must.

Over the last year plus, I've done 2 IUI's and 5 IVF cycles. The IUI's failed, obviously, lol. Of the IVF cycles, one was canceled before retrieval due to poor response, while the rest cumulatively produced 5 embryos which yielded 1 PGS/ PGD-normal embryo (ie, no chromosomal abnormalities and no Fragile X). It is now resting comfortably on ice, waiting for us to decide what to do with it.

I just finished cycle¬†#5, which produced 3 mature eggs, 2 embryos, and 0 blastocysts to biopsy and freeze. I'm not sure what to do next and could really, really use some advice from other people with infertility experience. The way I see it, we have three options:

(1) Proceed straight to the frozen embryo and hope like hell that it works, and then make peace with having an only child if we are lucky enough that it does (docs say I'm likely going to hit menopause around 38, so by the time I'm ready to try for baby #2 I will be out of time);

(2) Keep the frozen embryo in reserve and try to do more IVF cycles to get more embryos before trying to do a transfer;

(3) Go to donor eggs and try one of those before deploying the lone precious frozen embryo, in case my uterus is really unsuitable to carry a baby even when the embryo is normal.

Maybe there are more options I am not thinking of. Oh, and also, we have drained our insurance coverage and savings and would have to beg, borrow, and steal to finance any more IVF (or donor eggs) because our fancy, top-of-the-line clinic doesn't do payment plans. There are state grants but I'm ineligible due to how severe my fertility issues are (double lol). Anyway, any advice and especially similar experiences would be incredibly welcome.

I asked if this would be welcome and a couple of people said yes. If there's anything here that should not be, too, just let me know.

I've now completed my first mini/mild stimulation IVF cycle (a few days post-transfer so no final result yet). Below is a brain dump of everything that might be relevant or interesting. Please ask questions if there's anything I haven't covered. I'm by no means an expert in this field; some of the below is just what I've gleaned from internet research or based on discussions with doctors at my clinic and information from them.

**Background/diagnosis**

We have unexplained secondary infertility. An SA was normal. My ovarian reserve is on the low end; at 36 my AMH was 1.2 ng/ml, baseline AFC around 10. Since starting this round of TTC we have a year of regular cycles with one CP in May. We pursued treatment given my age. Neither myself nor my husband have any other relevant health issues. I should explain here that I'm in the UK, and neither my workplace health insurance nor the NHS were able to offer me anything with respect to infertility testing or treatment, so absolutely everything was 100% out of pocket for us.

**About mini/mild stimulation IVF**

Essentially, this form of IVF is the same as traditional IVF, but with lower doses of synthetic FSH. It's considered to be most useful for women who are older (35+) and/or with DOR and other diagnoses related to impaired ovarian reserve.

The theory is that high doses of stims when you are older/have low reserve are more likely to either do nothing (not encourage follicle growth and development in excess of the small number of follicles), or stimulate a higher number of poor quality follicles producing poor quality eggs. This raises the risk of OHSS. With lower doses among the target population, although fewer follicles develop, those that do are hopefully higher quality and have more chance of producing higher quality eggs. It's a quality not quantity play, for people who aren't good candidates for high quantity.

**The clinic**

My clinic specialises in mild stimulation and natural cycle IVF. It offers other fertility treatments and procedures.

*Why I chose it:* I proactively chose the clinic; I did some research based on my first set of test results from January 2017 and concluded that I would be a good candidate for milder stimulation. I liked the emphasis on quality over quantity; I liked the significantly reduced risk of OHSS (I've seen a couple of friends suffer moderate and severe OHSS); I actually liked the fact that the clinic commits to not automatically excluding women with very low AMH trying with their own eggs if they wish, at the expense of the clinic's success rates. Honestly, I also liked that treatment would not be long drawn out and would be less likely to interfere in my daily life. Like most of us, I have commitments I can't abandon for extended periods due to dealing with side effects. I felt that with lower doses of stims there was less chance of significant side effects.

*Initial Process:* The consultant I met agreed that I was a good candidate for IVF (never bothered with IUI as in the UK it's not considered effective for treating unexplained infertility). Since I ovulated well on my own (and had many months of perfect charts to prove it) we also excluded attempting less invasive options. I discussed a HyCoSy (standard UK test to check fallopian tube patency and for uterine abnormalities) but the doctor felt that due to my history my tubes were very likely to be open and we did not do it.

Standard protocol is Day 3 transfer, because the aim is to create fewer embryos than usual, and therefore waiting until Day 5 risks having nothing to transfer. They will occasionally transfer at Day 2.

*Success rates:* The clinic provides success rates divided by age group and definition of ""success"" - they define initial success as clinical pregnancy (visible on a scan), and complete success as live birth. The consultant provided us with an estimate of our own chances based on this. AFC was used to guide us on the maximum likely follicles to develop, with a 65% fertilisation rate of retrieved eggs. We received guidance that we should expect around 2 embryos from a cycle given our starting AFC. In general, I was shown an 18% per embryo live birth rate for 35-37 year old women, slightly below the HFEA average of 21%.

*Costs:* The cost of my cycle, including all meds, scans, blood test, retrieval and transfer, was just under ¬£5.2k. This also includes the betas and early pregnancy scan if we are fortunate enough to get that far. The [HFEA](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/) states that a single traditional cycle costs around ¬£5k in the UK, but I have no idea what that includes.

**The cycle**

I started stims on Day 2 of my natural cycle (no suppression). This was 150IU of Bemfola, similar to Gonal-f. My first monitoring scan and estradiol/LH blood test was CD6, when I started Cetrotide. As I responded well with 8 follicles growing, my dosage was maintained. I had a monitoring scan/bloods every 3 days after that, and stopped stims on CD11. I triggered on CD12 with 250mcg Ovidrelle. At that point my largest follicle was 22mm, with 4 more above 17mm (the clinic's benchmark for maturity). Another 3 were still growing below that size.

Semen analysis of the deposit: 53m/ml total, prog. motility 55%, morphology 6%. Post wash 3.5m/ml, 99% motility.

My retrieval was straightforward and 5 eggs were retrieved. We did not receive a maturity report. Four fertilized (no ICSI, that was an option available but not recommended). All of them were still growing at day 3, and we eventually transferred the best embryo at day 5 and froze another two. So from 8 follicles - 5 eggs - 4 fertilised - 3 embryos. PGS testing was available if we wanted but was not recommended, and needed to be done in conjunction with ICSI.

*How I felt:* I had mild bloating and discomfort starting around CD7, and by CD14 (retrieval), it was getting uncomfortable to sit straight for long. I wasn't so bloated that it hurt, though, and I could wear my normal clothes. My weight wasn't affected. I had mild cramps post transfer, but that's pretty much it.

Post transfer, progesterone supplementation is through Utrogestan 200mg vaginal suppositories 3x daily.

I‚Äôve been seeing an RE to figure out the root cause. Every loss ended by 6.5 weeks, with an SCH each time. After my second loss, a saline sono showed arcuate uterus and small fibroids outside the cavity but the RE was not concerned and gave us the green light to try again. 

After I had my third loss, the last RE moved so I started seeing a new RE. She suspected I had a bicornuate uterus and wanted me to do the MRI and HSG. 

I just had the follow-up for the results and my head is spinning. First of all, the HSG test showed dye flowing thru one tube but not the other. Because I have a history of an STI 10 years ago, she thinks this is closed. However there‚Äôs a chance that the tube spasmed during the test or the test was not performed properly, as she saw some issues with the catheter placement. While she admitted that she would like to see some improvements in the way the test was administered, due to the STI history, we can assume that side is closed. Because it‚Äôs not swollen, this does not cause MC and only lessens my chance of getting pregnant (although those 3x I got pregnant without intervention). 

The other main point is that fibroids are present. While they are not in the cavity, they appear to be pushing against the lining according to the HSG (but not in the MRI imaging). They are only 2 cm each, and she said that issues arise when they are over 5cm and inside the cavity. While science does not back this as a cause of MC, she is making a conjecture that these fibroids could be a cause. She mentioned getting them removed, but I have a big problem with undergoing a surgery for something that science doesn‚Äôt back as a link to MC. Also, the fact that the MRI did not show the fibroids pushing against the uterus but the HSG did. I would think the MRI would be more accurate.

I was diagnosed with low volume, low count, low or no motility & low morphology on multiple SA tests over the last year (Necrospermia /Oligoasthenoteratazoospermia). The concentration has always hovered between 1-6 million. I consulted multiple urologists/andrologists. One of them suggested trying Clomid for a 3 month period and see if the numbers improve. All 3 urologists felt low-grade varicoceles on the left but only 1 of them suggested surgery to correct the same and others felt the grade was not severe enough to cause semen abnormalities.

After the Clomid + antioxidant intake for 3 months, my Testosterone improved from low normal to high and there was an improvement in sperm quality (motility & morphology) but volume & quantity was still low. We then proceeded with IVF and ended up with 6 embryos (fertilization rate - 60%). But both our fresh and FETs failed and we're still left with 2 frozen embryos.

Now looking for the next steps as we had exhausted our options, I am wondering if I should go through the microsurgical varicocelectomy procedure. Various sources recommended it only if poor semen quality coexists with high FSH. Whereas my FSH is low normal & testosterone has decreased below normal levels in the latest hormonal screen. Is there anyone here with similar pathology who has been successful in overcoming this issue? Can anyone in the know suggest the best course of action based on my SA & hormone profile?

**Why the change?**  
On /r/TTC30 and /r/infertility ""BD,"" which typically stands for baby dance but can also stands for baby dust, is a [banned term](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7t7092/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms_terms/). After a discussion about FF's use of term, TTC30 mod /u/sasunnach encouraged me to do something about it. Initially the petition was to change the term to ""sex"" but /u/esseffdub pointed out that the term can be exclusionary to queer folks. The request to FF was changed from ""sex"" to the more inclusive ""insem,"" which stands for insemination. This morning /u/fertilitycharting [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/TTC30/comments/damyrs/petition_to_rename_bd_to_sex_in_ff/f1uyrx4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that they would change the label to ""I"" for insemination. The change is now live on the FF website and mobile app and it looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/rOMTyJo).

**Why did FF use BD in the first place?**   
When FF first started over 20 years ago the term ""sex"" was banned by forum profanity filters! They used ""BD"" (baby dance) instead to get around the restriction. You can learn more about the history on their [BD FAQs page](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/Faqs/BD-What-does-this-mean.html), which will be updated soon to include information about the switch to using ""I"" instead.",t2_3sm8vufa,False,,0,False,Fertility Friend has changed BD to I,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_dawf6o,False,dark,0.96,,public,102,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,102,,False,self,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1569798898.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><strong>After a</strong> <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TTC30/comments/damyrs/petition_to_rename_bd_to_sex_in_ff/""><strong>petition</strong></a> <strong>on TTC30 yesterday, Fertility Friend has changed the BD chart label to I.</strong> </p>

The first round would be $1020 upfront plus medication copayments, which they said could range from $900-1000, storage fee of $120 after insurance and possible anesthesia $100-500. I‚Äôm guessing it will be around $2500-3000 for the first round. Which seems doable. I don‚Äôt have it but I can put it on a credit card and figure it out. 

The dr said that if we got 8 eggs from the first round that would be about 50% of having a baby. My insurance has a lifetime max for medications of 15k and the financial counselor said that can be eaten up with the first round. 

So... I‚Äôm 32. Possible endo (very painful periods, heaving bleeding which improved after my pregnancy, my sister, aunt and 1st cousin have it) but I‚Äôve never formally diagnosed. When my husband and I were struggling to get pregnant they said he had a low sperm count and poor morphology due to an enlarged varicocele vein. However the urologist felt he should be able to conceive. So they ultimately said it was unexplained infertility.

Anyway, I need to be a mom to a living child. It‚Äôs been something that is very important to me my whole life.

Should I freeze my eggs? I know embryos are better but I don‚Äôt want to use a sperm donor right now. Hoping my husband and I can work it out or I will find someone one day that I want to have biological children with. 

Would it make sense to only do one round?

In a regular cycle, I normally experience cramping about 4 days after I ovulate. The cramping usually radiates down my thighs and gets progressively worse as I approach my period. Once my period starts, a different kind of worse cramping begins. It might have something to do with my Endo, but a doctor once told me it was proglastins, but she didn't think I had Endo at the time. 

I had my egg retrieval on Monday and a 3 day transfer yesterday. I have experienced the same kind of cramping I normally get as my period gets closer, but this time it started the day after retrieval. I asked my nurse about it yesterday, and she said cramping is normal after an ER. However, I am worried it's going to prevent implantation.

Like you all here, I‚Äôve gone through so much in these past few years. Now I‚Äôll be 40 in a few months and I feel like my time has run out. 

I have two good friends who I feel comfortable talking about my infertility issues with. But I feel like I can no longer talk with them about my issues. 

My one friend is currently pregnant with her second baby. We both did IVF to get pregnant and she was successful her first time. My first IVF failed miserably (no eggs in my follicles). When I told her she really made insensitive comments like you‚Äôre in early menopause, ask a cousin for her egg (since I have no siblings), or I‚Äôll give you one of my eggs. That was not the support I needed after having a failed cycle, so I didn‚Äôt speak with her for a few months. A few months ago she reached out to me and just texted how she was glowing and growing with baby #2. She even bombarded me with ultrasound pictures. When I didn‚Äôt respond initially, she kept texting asking if I saw the ultrasound and her comment of glowing and growing referred to baby #2 (no shit). I told her I was happy for her, but these things triggered me and I didn‚Äôt want to talk about her pregnancy but rather catch up she never responded to me. So that was pretty fucked up. 

My other friend who I talk to has a different issue. She had a miscarriage last year but was not upset. I asked her why and she said she was turning 40 and did not want to be pregnant for her 40th. She really was fine. Last night I was speaking with her husband and he told me she just aborted their baby after 8-9 weeks. I asked him why and she just didn‚Äôt what to be pregnant. He‚Äôs devastated because he really wants children, but they don‚Äôt see eye to eye. He assumed she told me this but I didn‚Äôt know she had an elective abortion. I know it‚Äôs her body and her choice and I‚Äôm not faulting her. But I just find it upsetting that I‚Äôve tried just about everything in my power to have a baby (supplements, naturopathic medicine, Chinese medicine, IVF/IUI, etc.) and I cannot get pregnant. But she can get pregnant fairly easily and would rather have an abortion. 

I‚Äôve been given a 5% chance of ever having a biological child. I‚Äôm not opposed to an egg donor but I really want a biological child of my own. I just feel so hopeless about this situation and just upset with my friends. I guess I just wanted to reach out to this community for some encouragement or kind words since I feel so shitty today.",t2_2lpqlk4j,False,,0,False,Frustrated and sad,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_d9q5fc,False,dark,0.97,,public,28,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Emotional Support,False,28,,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1569561658.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi all, I‚Äôve posted before about my I infertility and life issues (dad died unexpectedly, mom with terminal cancer, POF diagnosis, failed IVF/IUI).
