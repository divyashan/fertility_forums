I&#39;ve spotted all along on BC but this is heavier, though still not enough for more than a panty liner. Is this normal? I&#39;ll call my RE Monday.</p>

Today I went in for a CD8 checkup and my lining was already at an 8 and my lead follicle was an 18. The nurse called this afternoon to tell me that under ordinary circumstances, they would trigger me this weekend, but due to the clinic's schedule, I can't trigger until next Wednesday. :/  (CD13)

So basically I have to 
A) Cancel my cycle
B) Take Ganirelix for five days, then trigger on Wednesday (CD13) for a CD20 transfer.
C) Live on a prayer, don't take any Ganirelix, and hope I don't ovulate. I have my next checkup on Tuesday (CD12)

I really don't think I'm going to ovulate before my trigger shot. I have 28-29 day cycles and I feel like I always gear up to ovulate and then never get an LH surge. I feel like I'm pretty in tune with my body, so I know this, but obviously they don't know this about me, which is why they're prescribing Ganirelix to make sure I don't ovulate.

Something about this just feels off.

So maybe I'm upset about the Ganirelix? Big deal, I've taken Ganirelix before...

Unfortunately due to a fuck up at my OB's office, I ended up being more than a year overdue for a pap, which is a problem since I had a LEEP in November, 2012 for a CIN3 abnormality.  I got gardasil afterwards (although technically I was far too old) and my subsequent pap in May, 2013 was normal and there was no trace of the high-risk strain of HPV I previously tested positive for.  Even though I asked for a pap in the spring and summer of 2014 I was told by the nurse practitioner at my OB's office that I didn't need one since my previous pap was normal and HPV-negative.  I thought this sounded wrong but frankly, I was so wrapped up with my new endo dx that I didn't push it.  Well, the bitch was wrong, very wrong; I'm supposed to have paps once a year for the rest of my life.  Luckily she is no longer at my OB's clinic.

Anyway, I finally got in for a pap last week and got my results today: I again tested positive for the same high risk HPV strain and my pap results were ""EPITHELIAL ABNORMALITY ATYPICAL SQUAMOUS CELLS, CANNOT EXCLUDE HIGH GRADE LESION"".  I know that there are worse results than this but it means that I have to have a colposcopy (which will be next Tuesday) and also probably another LEEP.  My OB doesn't think this will throw off my FET schedule.  Even though I know that there is a very low likelihood of this being cancer I'm still freaking out.  All I can think about is how we just dropped 20k to create 4 beautiful embryos only for me to get cancer, a completely preventable cancer, and now I won't be able to even ATTEMPT a transfer because I'll need an emergency hysterectomy or something.  We can't afford a surrogate.  I know that these are crazy thoughts but I can't help thinking them.  

When I had my last LEEP my doctor told me that Mr. Kitteh should get gardasil, too.  I told him this and tried to get him to go to the doctor but he balked and it never happened.  Well today when he gets home I tell him what happened and that she still recommends gardasil for him, too.  What does he do?  Instead of comforting me he gets pissed that he has to go in for a shot that ""doesn't even work"" and is a total ass.  He also had a hissy about the cost even though, unlike three years ago, he actually has a fucking job now and can afford this easily.  I can't believe that when I need him most all he can think about is himself and his pocketbook.  Unbelievable.   

I am just so mad at....well, everyone right now.  I can't catch a fucking break.  I knew our IVF outcomes were too good to be true. I knew I wouldn't be able to sail into my FET happy and hopeful for once. I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop, and, well, here we are.  :(

So we set it all up with an empty syringe but the same problem of me not being able to override my monkey brain screaming ""WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO HURT YOURSELF?! YOU CAN'T DO THAT! _STOP!!_""

I don't even have a needle problem but I think it's legit to find this impossible to do on oneself. 

I could tell that sheer force of will was not going to cut it. I asked if she had any tips but I had already done all the textbook stuff (try holding it like a dart, do it quickly, count to three, I'll do it first so you know what it feels like). I could rest it on my skin but not push (and ow that stings from the alcohol) but couldn't do it quick from above the skin either. 

I tried switching from my abdomen to my upper front of thigh; no joy. 

The nurse said ""let's take a break and go over everything else first.""  While she was doing that, I had a lightbulb moment and pulled out the ice pack from [my picnic lunch](http://i.imgur.com/CAjFjJk) and put it on my other leg while we finished the details for the gonal-f pen and mixing the LH. 

By the time we came back to me my thigh was numb. The nurse also left to get some other paperwork thinking that maybe less attention would help. My husband turned his back. This time I could rest the tip and then push in because it was numb! I did it a second time to be sure.... YAY!

I'm really glad I had a chance to think of things to try when it became clear that brute force was Not Working.

Uh oh. Hubby had to do them last time and isn&#39;t coming with. </p>

<p>So we set it all up with an empty syringe but the same problem of me not being able to override my monkey brain screaming &quot;WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO HURT YOURSELF?! YOU CAN&#39;T DO THAT! <em>STOP!!</em>&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even have a needle problem but I think it&#39;s legit to find this impossible to do on oneself. </p>

<p>I could tell that sheer force of will was not going to cut it. I asked if she had any tips but I had already done all the textbook stuff (try holding it like a dart, do it quickly, count to three, I&#39;ll do it first so you know what it feels like). I could rest it on my skin but not push (and ow that stings from the alcohol) but couldn&#39;t do it quick from above the skin either. </p>

<p>I tried switching from my abdomen to my upper front of thigh; no joy. </p>

<p>The nurse said &quot;let&#39;s take a break and go over everything else first.&quot;  While she was doing that, I had a lightbulb moment and pulled out the ice pack from <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/CAjFjJk"">my picnic lunch</a> and put it on my other leg while we finished the details for the gonal-f pen and mixing the LH. </p>

<p>By the time we came back to me my thigh was numb. The nurse also left to get some other paperwork thinking that maybe less attention would help. My husband turned his back. This time I could rest the tip and then push in because it was numb! I did it a second time to be sure.... YAY!</p>

<p>I&#39;m really glad I had a chance to think of things to try when it became clear that brute force was Not Working. </p>

70,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Earlier this year, my husband and I made the decision to move across the country for his career.  I managed to get my employer to agree to allowing me to work from home, but at the time, I was getting courted by a lot of companies and could have leveraged a job hop into a big salary increase and a title bump.  But we'd started trying in January, so it was best for me to stay.  This turned out to be okay, because it allowed us to save money by not buying a second car right away (we moved from a large city), and I had a lot more leisure time.  Well now, a few months post-move, I am dealing with the client from hell.  He's rude, demanding, everything is urgent, and he demands so much of my time that the only way to take care of my other clients is to work late, really late.  I've worked until midnight a lot lately.  My husband's job is taking off nicelyand is stress-free, and I'm working my butt off in a job I've been over for months, because WE need the benefits (he's on my insurance), and I have a good reputation and wouldn't ruin my career by taking maternity leave (and paid by my company, at that).

But I'm fucking miserable right now.  It was hell when we didn't know what my body was doing, but as it turns out, my body is just slow to react to stimuli (low AMH) so it just took a freaking long time to snap back (8 months) after going off BC. That said, I can conceive just fine according to my RE.

And now we know our main issue was MFI all along.  Really low count, and 1% Krueger morphology, and IVF is our only hope.  The kicker is that the first available appointment he can get is Oct. 7th to see a urologist.  And depending on the outcome, we might have to wait months to correct the issue if it's correctable.  And that leaves us missing the boat completely on IVF until beginning of 2016, since most labs shut down in December and we need to do all of this in one calendar year and not spread it over two.  So now my body gets to go through hell when I don't even have anything wrong with me that would prevent me from conceiving naturally. I'm scared and upset.  It feels like someone else has cancer and I get to have the chemo.  I feel like a vessel for this, and I feel like I have no control over any of this despite how much I am putting in.  And due to my low AMH, it's going to be a struggle because we'll likely retrieve fewer eggs, though I'd be able to conceive normally or through IUI like any normal person at my age.  So going through all this may still be a huge fucking fail when combining this with ICSI and possibly PGS.  I don't think I can take the possible failure after all the waiting.

So that means 4 more months until we can even think of beginning this process.  I'm so miserable in my job, but we need the benefits (this is his health insurance too AND it covers $10k of infertility treatment) and the eventual maternity leave.  But when we said I'd stay the course on this, I was thinking I'd be looking for a new job early 2016.  Here I am, with all of this happening, and I'll be lucky if it's over by early 2017.  I don't think I can hold on, and I just feel so slighted. I'm making so many sacrifices and nothing is happening for me.


TL;DR Staying in a job I'm very much over, have stagnated my career to trade for benefits (infertility coverage, maternity leave) in lieu of a career boost and work has gotten very hostile with a disagreeable client.  Doing this while husband boosts his career, after we made a cross-country move for his career. Timing for him seeing a doctor is likely preventing us from starting until next year, meaning I will be at my job well into 2017.

I went to my OB over a year ago, telling him I had been trying for a year to get pregnant with no luck and very few periods. He told me to lose weight. I spent the next year doing that, and still, no regular monthly periods, no pregnancies.

In April I went back to him and he said I'd lost enough weight that he felt comfortable starting a clomid prescription (50mg days 5-9). He told me if I didn't have a temp rise and my period didn't start, to call in because of the risk of OHS, and that he would get me in the same day.

I started the provera/clomid cycle and started monitoring my BBT. The month went by and I never ovulated. On day 35 I called the doc. He got me in about a week later. No ultrasound, just a consult- and he upped my dosage to 100 mg cd 5-9. Still no monitoring or blood work.

Month 2 I also didn't ovulate or start a period on my own. He didn't have me call in and just prescribed a higher dose of clomid, now 150mg days 5-9. 

I didn't ovulate on that either. So after three non-ovulating, non-monitored months, two weeks ago I called my doctor to ask about doing a monitored cycle, and maybe trying Femara. Never got a call back. I've called five times over 2 weeks and have never gotten a single callback. Today I called and asked if it would just be easier to make an appointment. The nurse was like, ""I don't know, probably."" I asked when I could get in and the earliest he had was September 15th. 

Also, I believe I have PCOS. I have all of the main signs, as well as insulin resistance (IR diagnosed by this OB!) but he just keeps telling me my ultrasounds look normal without checking my hormone levels at all! 

I think I'm done. I've gone to this OB since I was 18, and I've always looked past the hour + waits in the waiting room, the scheduling difficulty, etc because I really liked him. I made an appointment with another OB in a nearby town. I'm just so angry and feel like I have wasted years when maybe another OB would have started this process and given a shit a year ago.

CD3-7 I took 50mg of Clomid, which I have taken twice in the past. Each time I got a dominant follicle on day 12 
CD14 follicle scan - no dominant follicle. Some small follicles. He says he'll likely see us in a month for another follicle scan (next cycle), and next CD3 I should take 100mg instead.  
CD19 uterus and follicle scan (different doctor, MC investigation related). Weird results. She gets her supervisor to do an additional scan - I have one 19mm periovulatory follicle, and a 23mm submucosal fibroid which is probably blocking a tube. The follicle she can see is on the clear side (yay!).   

I don't understand how a follicle could grow so quickly - from 'not at all dominant' to 'already ovulated, probably yesterday' in six days, is pretty weird, I seemed to ovulate on CD21 with Clomid in the past. Body, how. Body, why.   

If you have a submucosal fibroid - did you get it removed? How did that go? I know mine's quite small, but it must have only grown in the last 18 months. I'm stunned our infertility specialist missed it in the various follicle and dating scans he's done for us; and it wasn't mentioned four months ago at a 12-week scan (different clinic again) either, and that specialist is well respected here.  

I don't really understand what a fibroid means, and it wasn't really explained to me while I was getting the scan. I don't know enough to know what questions to be asking, and Dr. Google is not helping the situation.   

Also, our specialist keeps suggesting progesterone to prevent miscarriage if there is another pregnancy. I'm not convinced it'll help - it's likely the first loss was due to chromosomal issues, and the second was more freak in nature (amniotic sac ruptured > uterus contracted > crushed placenta, which hemorrhaged), isn't explained by progesterone deficiency, and occurred after 12w, at which point you'd stop taking the progesterone anyhow.

I can't help myself but read infertility blogs from time to time and they usually annoy the shit out of me with their stupid acronyms, so I was happy when I found this one. I'm a 36 year old lady who likes to write in standard English, not a 14 year old kid who writes in text speak with dumb acronyms. We have primary unexplained infertility, and I went through several cycles of letrozole and timed intercourse and no pregnancy, so I moved on to IVF and just finished my first cycle.

I'm feeling like a total failure of a human being, and I'm out a whole bunch of money which I really didn't have to spare. I'm an otherwise successful person who can do a lot of stuff. I can build things and do some fairly complicated home repairs, have a good green thumb, but I can't fucking reproduce and I feel like it's killing me slowly from the inside. My husband, who is generally pretty awesome, has never been good at sympathy and when I told him I was having a hard time with this negative result and feeling like a failure, he was just like ""well, sometimes that's the way it goes."" I tried telling him that was not comforting and in fact affirmed my  failure, and he still said ""but that's the way it is. It's not your fault, it's just the way it is."" Ummm, not cool.

They want us to try the same protocol because they said I responded well. Femara for 5 days & Follistim for 4 days.
So first question, is taking medication like this + estrogen + progesterone every month going to have any negative side effects on my health down the road?

Also if we want to do more than 3 IUIs (next is our 3rd) should we do breaks in between or anything? I know my lining was thin when they checked before IUI but then they would put me on estrogen & not seem concerned. 

Lastly, when they first checked my thyroid originally, I was a tiny bit high for trying to have a baby, so they put me on medication & then it went too low, like 0.something so then they said to take it every other day.

This is my first cycle with a new fertility clinic. We have been TTC for over 2 years (tried Clomid, Femara, Femara+Ovidrel+IUI once at old clinic). I have PCOS (and treated hypothyroidism and MTHFR A1298C homozygous) but that doesn't seem to be the issue because my labs looked pretty good. Hubby has mild male factor (low morphology). The plan was to do IVF with ICSI (doctor first suggested trying more IUI's, but since our insurance covers unlimited IVF, we decided to skip the IUI's). 


My AMH was a little low (1.12), but the doc wasn't worried because my antral follicle count was 28 and my FSH was good. I've had a normal sonohysterogram and my labs have all looked good other than the low AMH.



Anyway, I'm on day 9 of stims (Gonal F 150 iu and Menopur 150 iu), which I started on cycle day 5 (because the doctor didn't want me to start on a Tuesday or Wednesday so he had me to wait until day 5). We added Ganirelix on cycle day 9 to prevent me from ovulating until it's time to trigger.


On day 5 of stims, I went in for my first monitoring appointment. Ultrasound showed 8 follicles less than 8mm on right, 6 follicles less than 10mm on left, and one 16mm follicle on the left. Estradiol(E2) was 350, LH was 3.1.
I was told to keep the same dosages and schedule for my meds and to come back the next day for another Estradiol (E2) level.



E2 was 526 on day 6 of stims, no ultrasound that day.



They had me come back yesterday (day 8 of stims) for another Estradiol (E2) level and ultrasound. My E2 was 1235. Ultrasound showed 4 follicles (2 on each side). They were 21, 15, 13 & 13mm.  The nurse said the doctor wants me to keep everything the same (dosage of meds) and come in on day 10 of stims (tomorrow) for another ultrasound and E2 level. 


Yesterday, I was told that since I need 5 mature follicles to do an egg retrieval for IVF, the doctor might convert this cycle to an IUI because I only have four right now and the 21mm will likely be overmature by the time egg retrieval would happen. So unless some of the small follicles start maturing, I would be left with only 3 mature follicles (which she said is good for an IUI, but makes me worry about multiples since we planned to only transfer one embyro with IVF).



I asked if I don't get pregnant this cycle, would I need to have my med dosages increased the next time since I didn't respond well enough and was told probably. After I got off the phone with the nurse, I wondered why the doctor wouldn't increase the dosages now, to try to get the small follicles to mature enough so I could still do IVF this cycle. I called back and asked and was told that she would not call and question the doctor (he wasn't in the office then) but she would ask him today and call me back this afternoon about it. 


I will have one dose of Menopur this evening, then my monitoring appointment is at 9am tomorrow and my Ganirelix and Gonal F aren't due until 9:15am tomorrow. So even if he does increase the dose, I doubt it could make much of a difference at this point, since I was told he would probably decide if I'm doing IVF or IUI based on tomorrow morning's results, and that I would probably do either the egg retrieval (if by some miracle, I have enough mature follices) or an IUI on Monday, after probably triggering tomorrow.

I called back and asked and was told that she would not call and question the doctor (he wasn&#39;t in the office then) but she would ask him today and call me back this afternoon about it. </p>

<p>I will have one dose of Menopur this evening, then my monitoring appointment is at 9am tomorrow and my Ganirelix and Gonal F aren&#39;t due until 9:15am tomorrow. So even if he does increase the dose, I doubt it could make much of a difference at this point, since I was told he would probably decide if I&#39;m doing IVF or IUI based on tomorrow morning&#39;s results, and that I would probably do either the egg retrieval (if by some miracle, I have enough mature follices) or an IUI on Monday, after probably triggering tomorrow.</p>

<p>Advice? Thank you!</p>

For women with PCOS and/or insulin resistance, the research seems pretty clear that low carb is a good idea.  It seems like some theories out there might also support a low carb/high protein, or even keto, diet for egg quality.  What are your thoughts in general about this?  

I'm doing a FET in late September with my single frozen blast and I started a low carb (50g-80g per day) diet because I wanted to be ready if the FET failed that in a few months I'd do another stim/retrieval cycle.  I'm unexplained but it seems like it's probably egg quality issues, and I wanted to throw everything at it, so I started this diet.  My specific problem is that I really hate the foods I can eat.  I thought of myself as an adventurous eater and I'm having trouble stomaching the constant barrage of rich and meaty foods.  Prior to this I ate 80% vegetarian and I'm having to eat entire chicken breasts in a single meal drenched in fatty sauces- which is fine for a single meal, but meal after meal after meal it gets nauseating. Also, Keto relies heavily on artificial sweeteners and I worry about the health impact of those, so I can't cook many non-meat alternatives.  I'm a healthy weight and I don't want to lose weight and I'm consistently 300 calories below my maintenance calorie goal.  I'm concerned that I'm hurting my chances for this FET to work if I'm losing weight and under this amount of stress over figuring out what I can eat, should eat, can stomach.  I've lost all desire to eat (this happens when I am stressed) and dread food in general.  Even foods I used to enjoy I now can't stomach.  I think after all this I might go full vegetarian for awhile.  

But I don't want to drop the diet if it is genuinely something I can do to improve egg quality!  Husband and I are discussing what to do and we are trying to discuss it from an intellectual place about what improves our chances for the FET or future sims/retrievals, not an emotional place about what we'd like to be eating instead of massive hamburger patties covered in cheese and mayo wrapped in a single lettuce leaf.

Two weeks ago I was diagnosed with my second ectopic pregnancy of the year - this on top of a 22-week loss after Femara/IUI due to cervical insufficiency last October.  

I've been deeply grieving this latest loss since my ultrasound earlier this month - my pregnancy came as a bit of a surprise since my HCG levels started somewhat low (right at 25), but we had wonderful increases and my progesterone looked great, so even my doctor felt confident that life was finally turning around after grieving my son for nearly a year.  Not so much.  I am a bit lucky in that both of my ectopics were able to be treated with methotrexate and my tubes have been spared.  I have a blood draw tomorrow at which we are expecting my HCG to be at zero - a relatively fast resolution, especially compared to this spring, when my ectopic took more than a month and a half to resolve.  

The doc and I have spoken briefly about the future, and a big part of my grief this past week has been the news that IVF will likely be the safest and most effective option should we want to keep trying to build a family (and we do).  Knowing that a future pregnancy will be considered high-risk, require frequent monitoring of my cervix, and entail a cerclage and weekly P17 injections is heavy enough...but now we're adding to the mix the need for invasive intervention just to get pregnant again.  My heart is heavy, and my only consolation is that IVF is effective and takes my risk of another ectopic down from something like 25-50% to 1-3% (basically the same risk at in the general population).  We have a consult with my RE on Friday to debrief this latest loss, lay out all the options, and start talking about what IVF will look like for us.  I'm not sure if this will be an actual IVF consult for us or if we'll need a separate appointment to get into the nitty gritty of treatment.  (My hunch is the latter.) 

So tell me - are any of you going through IVF due to ectopic pregnancies?  What did your doctors tell you?  What questions should I ask on Friday?

* Success rates given our circumstances 
* When could we start? Do we wait for urologist results – if yes, how long will that take? (We haven't received urologist appt yet but it's supposed to be in the works)
* Cancelled cycle refunds – when does that apply?
* Where do I get drugs from? Can I get DINs?
* Mock transfer?
* Will we do suppression at beginning of cycle?
* Will we need to freeze a sperm sample to ensure we have enough on ER day?
* Protocol?

After two annov cycles, I tried to do Femara on my own without my OBGYN knowing (I was scared to go back to the RE), and that didn't work either and ended up being annov.

Tomorrow is my CD3 bloodwork and ultrasound, next week is my HSG and saline sonogram...and then I have to figure out where to go from there. 

I wanted to do another Femara cycle, but after all the annov cycles, I'm starting to think that is pointless, just like my RE told me. I wanted to conceive ""normally"" but, nothing is normal about what is going on with my body, so maybe I should move on from that pipe dream. 

I have the three attempts per live birth stipulation with our insurance. Last time, it took me four attempts (we had different insurance that didn't have that ""rule""). I am stressed out about this time because of this. I am also stressed out because we have to pay, and last time, we didn't. 

I've been crying about it because my husband is mad about spending the money, and he said he's ""apathetic"" about trying for another baby because he doesn't want to go through all this again. I feel horribly guilty because this is my fault, and if I was a ""normal"" woman, I'd not have to shell out thousands of dollars to TRY to get pregnant. 

We have two frozen embryos. We originally wanted to do two SETs, but now that will take up two of our three tries -- and three out of my four cycles failed with SETs. My fourth cycle was a FET and a double embryo transfer, which my son came out of. 

So, our choice now is to start with a fresh cycle, hopefully get more embryos to freeze just in case, and then do subsequent FETs, or to start with the FET, transfer two embryos and then do a fresh cycle if that fails.

Her OB gave her clomid which led to a DNC due to the fetus stopping development around week 7. We had exceeded 6 months of clomid so we went to an RE.

Our first RE told us she likely had PCOS (she never fully confirmed) and after many tests told us IUI or IVF. IUI being a 15% chance per cycle and IVF being 60% per cycle. Since insurance covered absolutely nothing and PCOS simply seems like we should get something like metformin (+ diet) to ovulate and get pregnant normally, we decided to go to a smaller RE. 

Our second RE got all of our records and basically is rerunning all the tests. Again, insurance covers nothing. He said the PCOS can be managed and things like IVF aren't necessary. But while we are waiting on that, he has some whacky diet for my wife. Since PCOS is similar to diabetes (type 1 runs in her family), we figured it was simple. But he pedaled his iPhone app that we can't get because we don't use iPhones and has no documentation about his specific diet. 

The diet is essentially low glycemic index. But a few extras. No wheat, no potatos/rice AT ALL. Fine, that's high GI. No oatmeal (low GI). But dark chocolate is ok. He says the metformin will cause issues if she doesn't follow his diet to a T. Vomiting and diarrhea within an hour of eating something ""wrong"".

When we went today for some blood work, she tried to ask about more specifics. A sheet of paper, why no oatmeal, etc. He was very snippy about it. Grapes (GI 59) are bad but kiwis (GI 58) are ok. He didn't have any helpful advice other than ""just eat what I told you to eat"". Mother fucker, you mentioned 12 ingredients. 

Our last RE didn't want to do another clomid cycle because she would want to do blood work and the cost is only $500 shy of an IUI.

159,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"We had our follow up last Wednesday for the summer bout of 3 IUIs. Unstimmed, with progesterone support, with a CP (of 7 16DPIUI) in the middle cycle. Our prior diagnosis was MFI but Mr. mL's counts keep going up and I've been knocked up on two unstimmed IUIs and one fluke. 

The doc doesn't care about our CPs. They are not diagnostically relevant to her. The other two tied for longest at doubling once (peaking at 26 and 140) with neither making it to the end of the 5th week. 

This was definitely surprising. She said that it was because we don't know how many CPs happen in the wild, so we don't know if they are diagnostically relevant in fertility-challenged couples. 

Since we did an IVF last year they had already seen my eggs and our embryos up close and although only getting 2 of 8-3s to freeze on day 3 was worse than expected, they apparently aren't worried yet about chromosomes and still think it was the stimming's fault. 

Right after our third CP I played a shitty game of telephone with the clinic because I wanted to know: if they were going to order a bunch of tests, I wanted to do the tests in time to get the results back for the August 19 appointment. So at this appointment the doctor was thinking I was demanding those tests when I was trying to ask if she wanted them. AWKWARD, I AM SO.

We decided to skip the karyotyping for now. We have pretty much decided we wouldn't do PGS anyway and we can check later if it's getting to us or we have RPL. 

There were some public-insurance-covered tests she did order just for the hell of it - an SIS (which I haven't had done there nor since my biggest CP), a check of my thyroid (already back as normal), a something coagulant, and a lupus test (insert House reference). I decided to file these inspecifically as ""things she wants done.""  All other tests are ""things she doesn't think we need.""  This is a coping mechanism. 

And the timing maybe probably can work out to squeeze in the SIS during the BCP cycle of the long protocol I'm starting now (my period came between then and now), as long as I get a call back from her office in time. 

But yes -- we're starting a long protocol! That's the awesome news. Three weeks BCP and then starting stimming a few days after they end. EDIT: and a nurse hinted that part of the stimming might overlap which makes my solo trip to Vancouver interesting.

Of course that came with its own bombshells. There's no alternate trigger on their long protocol because they're already putting me on LH so they can't surprise my system with LH... so the trigger'll be hCG again. I was already on dostinex last time when I got my mild OHSS (sidelined for 7 days) but there's no such thing as a higher dose.

Then she said ""so we'll have to monitor you to make sure that you aren't in OHSS before we decide if we're doing a freeze-all.""

Um what? I thought that because of last time we were definitely doing a freeze-all! And the more I think about it, the more I wish that were the case. It was such a relief to think that no matter what happened with the embryos I wouldn't have to think about going back to the clinic for the fresh transfer (which day? when? can I get a ride?) -- I could just focus on getting better from the retrieval. 

And I am really annoyed that there's no explanation for or diagnostic usefulness from the CPs. It shouldn't matter to me that she's dismissing it; even if there's something terribly wrong, they would want to check with and probably treat with IVF anyway. But it feels like a lose end that I wish they cared about.

I talked to the doctor about the <40% carbs, >25% protein diet I've been trying which has a human study that seems legit. She doesn't like super-low-carb diets but was fine with 40% and told me to double-check what the max protein for my weight should be for kidney function (I found something that said a max of 1.1 per pound which is almost exactly 25% of my 1800cal a day). 

She said she had seen research for CoQ10 for older women and that it wouldn't hurt. But on the flip side they don't want me on aspirin because of possible bleeding during the egg retrieval, so I'm going to continue to run any medicinal strategies past her before trying them. 

I feel like we count as unexplained more than MFI at this point. Purely MFI would not be giving us all these implanted embryos, not even only for a day or six. 

But holy crap! We're in a treatment protocol! I'm picking up my BCP tomorrow to start them at bedtime. I paid my fees and got my one-on-two education session booked for me and Mr. mL to learn the new meds and brush up on the techniques, and find out if I will have to stab myself when I'm in Vancouver by myself the first week of September (I haven't stabbed myself even once yet).

Unstimmed, with progesterone support, with a CP (of 7 16DPIUI) in the middle cycle. Our prior diagnosis was MFI but Mr. mL&#39;s counts keep going up and I&#39;ve been knocked up on two unstimmed IUIs and one fluke. </p>

<p>The doc doesn&#39;t care about our CPs. They are not diagnostically relevant to her. The other two tied for longest at doubling once (peaking at 26 and 140) with neither making it to the end of the 5th week. </p>

<p>This was definitely surprising. She said that it was because we don&#39;t know how many CPs happen in the wild, so we don&#39;t know if they are diagnostically relevant in fertility-challenged couples. </p>

<p>Since we did an IVF last year they had already seen my eggs and our embryos up close and although only getting 2 of 8-3s to freeze on day 3 was worse than expected, they apparently aren&#39;t worried yet about chromosomes and still think it was the stimming&#39;s fault. </p>

<p>Right after our third CP I played a shitty game of telephone with the clinic because I wanted to know: if they were going to order a bunch of tests, I wanted to do the tests in time to get the results back for the August 19 appointment. So at this appointment the doctor was thinking I was demanding those tests when I was trying to ask if she wanted them. AWKWARD, I AM SO.</p>

<p>We decided to skip the karyotyping for now. We have pretty much decided we wouldn&#39;t do PGS anyway and we can check later if it&#39;s getting to us or we have RPL. </p>

<p>There were some public-insurance-covered tests she did order just for the hell of it - an SIS (which I haven&#39;t had done there nor since my biggest CP), a check of my thyroid (already back as normal), a something coagulant, and a lupus test (insert House reference). I decided to file these inspecifically as &quot;things she wants done.&quot;  All other tests are &quot;things she doesn&#39;t think we need.&quot;  This is a coping mechanism. </p>

<p>And the timing maybe probably can work out to squeeze in the SIS during the BCP cycle of the long protocol I&#39;m starting now (my period came between then and now), as long as I get a call back from her office in time. </p>

<p>But yes -- we&#39;re starting a long protocol! That&#39;s the awesome news. Three weeks BCP and then starting stimming a few days after they end. EDIT: and a nurse hinted that part of the stimming might overlap which makes my solo trip to Vancouver interesting.</p>

<p>Of course that came with its own bombshells. There&#39;s no alternate trigger on their long protocol because they&#39;re already putting me on LH so they can&#39;t surprise my system with LH... so the trigger&#39;ll be hCG again. I was already on dostinex last time when I got my mild OHSS (sidelined for 7 days) but there&#39;s no such thing as a higher dose.</p>

<p>Then she said &quot;so we&#39;ll have to monitor you to make sure that you aren&#39;t in OHSS before we decide if we&#39;re doing a freeze-all.&quot;</p>

<p>Um what? I thought that because of last time we were definitely doing a freeze-all! And the more I think about it, the more I wish that were the case. It was such a relief to think that no matter what happened with the embryos I wouldn&#39;t have to think about going back to the clinic for the fresh transfer (which day? when? can I get a ride?) -- I could just focus on getting better from the retrieval. </p>

<p>And I am really annoyed that there&#39;s no explanation for or diagnostic usefulness from the CPs. It shouldn&#39;t matter to me that she&#39;s dismissing it; even if there&#39;s something terribly wrong, they would want to check with and probably treat with IVF anyway. But it feels like a lose end that I wish they cared about.</p>

<p>I talked to the doctor about the &lt;40% carbs, &gt;25% protein diet I&#39;ve been trying which has a human study that seems legit. She doesn&#39;t like super-low-carb diets but was fine with 40% and told me to double-check what the max protein for my weight should be for kidney function (I found something that said a max of 1.1 per pound which is almost exactly 25% of my 1800cal a day). </p>

<p>She said she had seen research for CoQ10 for older women and that it wouldn&#39;t hurt. But on the flip side they don&#39;t want me on aspirin because of possible bleeding during the egg retrieval, so I&#39;m going to continue to run any medicinal strategies past her before trying them. </p>

<p>I feel like we count as unexplained more than MFI at this point. Purely MFI would not be giving us all these implanted embryos, not even only for a day or six. </p>

<p>But holy crap! We&#39;re in a treatment protocol! I&#39;m picking up my BCP tomorrow to start them at bedtime. I paid my fees and got my one-on-two education session booked for me and Mr. mL to learn the new meds and brush up on the techniques, and find out if I will have to stab myself when I&#39;m in Vancouver by myself the first week of September (I haven&#39;t stabbed myself even once yet). The trip moved from being days 7-14 when my period came FIVE days early. </p>

The surgery took longer than expected. Roughly two hours. Since we scheduled the surgery almost immediately, the surgery wasn't complete until about 10:30PM. Our favorite doctor (Dr. W) came out from surgery to tell me that everything went fine. My wife did well in the surgery and Dr. W confirmed that it had been an ectopic pregnancy that had formed in the very tiny tubal stump left over from the previous surgery. If it had gone another week undiagnosed, my wife's life would have been in serious jeopardy.

One week after the surgery we met with Dr. W for a follow-up examination and to discuss the surgery and what the next steps should be.

What we learned from that meeting was that the pregnancy was about two thirds in the tubal stump and one third in the [cornu or uterine horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_horns). With the combination of the pregnancy and hormones, the uterine wall had become extremely thin and delicate. Dr. W used the term ['friable'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/friable).

The concern Dr. W told us, was how well would my wife's uterus heal following the pregnancy and subsequent emergency surgery? The thin, friable part of her uterus was quite difficult to mend during the surgical procedure and required a special gel to seal, rather than stitches. Because of this, there is concern about how well my wife's uterus will recover and subsequently support a pregnancy.

Dr. W's recommendation is to perform another laparoscopy to perform a special blue dye injection into my wife's uterus and observe if the uterus is too thin anywhere (the thin parts would be transparent and the blue dye would be visible). This procedure would have one of three outcomes: the uterus is OK and no further intervention is required, the uterus is too thin is one section and would be stitched in a way to strengthen the thin areas, or the uterus is too thin or too affected to repair (in this case, [surrogacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy) would be the only option).

One alternative to all of this is to not perform this procedure and move forward with another attempt at IVF with one of our frozen embryos. We would have no way of know for sure how well her uterus has healed and my wife would need to be constantly monitored during a pregnancy.

We have now reached present day at this point in the story. The first day of school is here and my wife is now back to work. She has recovered well from the surgery, remarkably well.

We are faced with a decision. Do we perform another laparoscopy? That procedure, while common, will always present a risk but will inform us of the state of W's uterine health. If needed, this could possibly be corrected, but presents more potential for complications (for example, pregnancies that embed around the scar/stitch area).

Or do we leave it all alone and trust in her body's ability to heal?

...continued from [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i8zae/our_story_part_2_hydrosalpinx/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

My wife is a first grade teacher. That job is stressful and demanding to say the least. Considering all that we had been through, we wanted the best odds for success with IVF, so we waited until the school year was over and W would be able to rest comfortably, take care of herself, and keep her stress levels to a minimum.

The end of the school year would mark one and a half years since W first discovered she was pregnant. Up to this point my wife had a misdiagnosed ectopic pregnancy and had been unknowingly dangerously close to dying. She had also undergone two laparoscopic procedures, one as an emergency to remove the tubal pregnancy, and the other to electively remove the other blocked/inflamed tube in order to greatly increase the odds of IVF success. She was now sterile and IVF was the only remaining option to conceive.

The time finally arrived, and W began the IVF protocol. This required birth control medicine to ensure proper timing of her ovulation cycle, followed by daily hormone injections, various medicines, and prenatal vitamins. On top of this, as time progressed, W was required to visit the fertility clinic almost daily for blood monitoring and ultrasounds. It was somewhat stressful, but always through it all, we knew that this could finally result in a pregnancy.

After a couple weeks of this protocol, it was finally time to retrieve the eggs. This meant W must once again go under general anesthesia so that the fertility doctors could extract as many eggs from her (now greatly enlarged) ovaries.

The weeks of IVF protocol worked and the procedure was able to extract 18 eggs. Of these 18 eggs, 17 were confirmed to be successfully fertilized 24 hours later. By the day of the transfer, five days after the egg retrieval, there were 8 eggs remaining that were deemed of high enough quality to warrant transfer. One would be transferred, seven would be frozen.

The day of the transfer was a cautiously optimistic day for us. It was a long journey to get here and we were nervous, but excited. Once we got into the procedure room, we discovered that Dr. R would be the physician performing our transfer. This was merely a matter of scheduling, but Dr. R represented an ill omen for us considering our last encounter with him was far from positive. Always trust your gut.

The transfer went without incident and was confirmed to have been successfully deposited (by means of determining its absence from the syringe).

Once more we waited. Despite the fact the clinic explicitly advises you against doing an at-home pregnancy test (to guard against false positive/negatives) my wife performed four the day before and day of her appointment to have the official pregnancy test performed. W was pregnant! This was wonderful news and I was elated. Both the at-home and official lab work confirmed she was pregnant.

Time went on and W's hCG levels were monitored. Everything looked good and it appeared the pregnancy was on schedule. Finally the day of our first ultrasound appointment arrived and we were excited, anxious, and nervous about the prospect of hearing the baby's heartbeat for the first time.

I went with my wife to the appointment and held her hand as the doctor (Dr. W, our favorite) performed the ultrasound. Almost immediately, despite Dr. W's attempts to calm us, we knew something was amiss.

After an agonizing few minutes, Dr. W told us that the pregnancy was there, however, it was not where it was supposed to be. It appeared to be in what little stump of a tube remained or (unbelievably) on her ovary.

For my wife, she knew exactly what this meant. For me, it required a bit more explanation to really sink in. This pregnancy was effectively over and my wife would require another surgery to remove the pregnancy. In fact the doctor insisted that she have it performed that night since it was (as before) endangering her health.

My wife was inconsolable at this point. For 18 months we had waited and endured more hardships than many couples endure over 10 years. We had been strong, *she* had been strong, but this latest news was too much to bear. This would be her third surgery. This would be the second time she needed emergency surgery to remove a tubal pregnancy! She would have surgery to remove a tubal pregnancy, despite the fact both of her tubes had previously been removed!

<p>My wife is a first grade teacher. That job is stressful and demanding to say the least. Considering all that we had been through, we wanted the best odds for success with IVF, so we waited until the school year was over and W would be able to rest comfortably, take care of herself, and keep her stress levels to a minimum.</p>

<p>The end of the school year would mark one and a half years since W first discovered she was pregnant. Up to this point my wife had a misdiagnosed ectopic pregnancy and had been unknowingly dangerously close to dying. She had also undergone two laparoscopic procedures, one as an emergency to remove the tubal pregnancy, and the other to electively remove the other blocked/inflamed tube in order to greatly increase the odds of IVF success. She was now sterile and IVF was the only remaining option to conceive.</p>

<p>The time finally arrived, and W began the IVF protocol. This required birth control medicine to ensure proper timing of her ovulation cycle, followed by daily hormone injections, various medicines, and prenatal vitamins. On top of this, as time progressed, W was required to visit the fertility clinic almost daily for blood monitoring and ultrasounds. It was somewhat stressful, but always through it all, we knew that this could finally result in a pregnancy.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks of this protocol, it was finally time to retrieve the eggs. This meant W must once again go under general anesthesia so that the fertility doctors could extract as many eggs from her (now greatly enlarged) ovaries.</p>

<p>The weeks of IVF protocol worked and the procedure was able to extract 18 eggs. Of these 18 eggs, 17 were confirmed to be successfully fertilized 24 hours later. By the day of the transfer, five days after the egg retrieval, there were 8 eggs remaining that were deemed of high enough quality to warrant transfer. One would be transferred, seven would be frozen.</p>

<p>The day of the transfer was a cautiously optimistic day for us. It was a long journey to get here and we were nervous, but excited. Once we got into the procedure room, we discovered that Dr. R would be the physician performing our transfer. This was merely a matter of scheduling, but Dr. R represented an ill omen for us considering our last encounter with him was far from positive. Always trust your gut.</p>

<p>The transfer went without incident and was confirmed to have been successfully deposited (by means of determining its absence from the syringe).</p>

<p>Once more we waited. Despite the fact the clinic explicitly advises you against doing an at-home pregnancy test (to guard against false positive/negatives) my wife performed four the day before and day of her appointment to have the official pregnancy test performed. W was pregnant! This was wonderful news and I was elated. Both the at-home and official lab work confirmed she was pregnant.</p>

<p>Time went on and W&#39;s hCG levels were monitored. Everything looked good and it appeared the pregnancy was on schedule. Finally the day of our first ultrasound appointment arrived and we were excited, anxious, and nervous about the prospect of hearing the baby&#39;s heartbeat for the first time.</p>

<p>I went with my wife to the appointment and held her hand as the doctor (Dr. W, our favorite) performed the ultrasound. Almost immediately, despite Dr. W&#39;s attempts to calm us, we knew something was amiss.</p>

<p>After an agonizing few minutes, Dr. W told us that the pregnancy was there, however, it was not where it was supposed to be. It appeared to be in what little stump of a tube remained or (unbelievably) on her ovary.</p>

<p>For my wife, she knew exactly what this meant. For me, it required a bit more explanation to really sink in. This pregnancy was effectively over and my wife would require another surgery to remove the pregnancy. In fact the doctor insisted that she have it performed that night since it was (as before) endangering her health.</p>

<p>My wife was inconsolable at this point. For 18 months we had waited and endured more hardships than many couples endure over 10 years. We had been strong, <em>she</em> had been strong, but this latest news was too much to bear. This would be her third surgery. This would be the second time she needed emergency surgery to remove a tubal pregnancy! She would have surgery to remove a tubal pregnancy, despite the fact both of her tubes had previously been removed!</p>

After several months of very concerted and deliberate effort to conceive, we had no luck. Frustrated and determined, W made an appointment with a fertility clinic to help diagnose any potential issues. The initial ultrasound the fertility clinic performed revealed that W was days if not hours away from ovulating from the ovary next to the remaining tube. We were told to capitalize on this news as often as possible for the next few days. We did.

Despite our best efforts, W did not become pregnant. We scheduled an [HSG test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterosalpingography) with the fertility clinic as a first step to determine if there was a cause for our lack of success. Thankfully, this procedure did not require general anesthesia, only a mild sedative. However, it is none the less an intimidating procedure. 

Once the test was complete, the doctor performing the procedure, Dr. R, told us there was good news and bad news. The bad news was that W had a [hydrosalpinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosalpinx). This meant that due to the blockage and fluid buildup in the fallopian tube, there would be no way we could conceive naturally. It also meant we would definitely need to do IVF. Along with this, Dr. R informed us that he recommended that we have the remaining tube removed as well since a hydrosalpinx would reduce the chance of IVF succeeding by 50%. As one could imagine, W was quite upset. For those of you keeping track, the good news Dr. R was referring to was that we now knew why we were unable to conceive. I can certainly understand the frustration of not having any answers for infertility, however this was little comfort to us in the moment and far from our definition of 'good news'.

Opting to have the remaining tube removed was an extremely difficult decision. W had never undergone any type of surgery prior to her emergency laparoscopy. Considering how unexpected and crushing the last experience was, W was very anxious about having another surgery. This however, paled in comparison to the decision to remove the remaining tube. After all, this would effectively make her sterile and our only chances of conceiving thereafter would be IVF. Ask yourself, would I volunteer to sterilize myself in order to improve my odds of conception? It sounds crazy, but this was the decision before us. 

After many days (or was it weeks?) of deliberation, W decided to have the other tube removed. The reasoning being, if it doesn't work and will only hurt our chances of conceiving from IVF, then it should be removed. 

W opted to have the procedure performed by Dr. L again. Due to W's job constraints, we had to wait for several months before the timing was right to perform the procedure. As Tom Petty says: waiting is the hardest part.

In our discussions with Dr. L prior to the surgery. Dr. L was given a strict mandate to ensure that the tube was definitely a hydrosalpinx and had no chance of recovering. After the procedure was over, Dr. L confirmed the tube was completely blocked, unusable, and had been removed.

It was official, W was now effectively sterile and we waited to begin our last best hope of conceiving: IVF.

--------------------------
This all began in very early January of 2014. My wife ('W') had discovered that she was pregnant the month before. She emerged from the bathroom one evening quite distressed, concerned about blood and tissue she had passed. We rushed to the emergency department were she was diagnosed with a miscarriage. No procedure was performed and no medication was prescribed. She followed up with her OB to track her [hCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin) levels down to zero. Almost immediately following this, we relocated 600 miles away for my new job. W needed to find a new OB and to continue monitoring her levels.

For four months W was spotting and her hCG levels were trending very very slowly. W was quite distressed since each day she discovered spotting was another reminder of the terrible event she had just endured and was left wondering when it would end. Her OB recommended waiting since her hCG levels had reached zero (finally). The ultrasounds however were not helpful, since they seemed to indicate the presence of something, which was diagnosed as a cyst (another scare for W).

After a few weeks of still spotting, frustrated, W sought the opinion of a new OB. This OB performed another ultrasound at which point blood was discovered in her abdomen. She was immediately rushed to the emergency department to undergo a laparoscopic procedure to diagnose the problem. Once underway, it was immediately clear to the OB/surgeon that this was a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and not a miscarriage. The surgeon needed to remove the affected fallopian tube since the pregnancy had developed for so long. It was at that point we realized that W's life had been hanging in the balance for the last several months. The following days and weeks were filled with anger, sadness, frustration, fear, and disbelief.

In the follow-up meetings with her new OB and savior (Dr. L), we were told that our ability to conceive would not be greatly impacted in the long term. The other tube looked healthy and we could continue trying to conceive once W was fully recovered from the surgery. Optimistic and hopeful, we thought that the worst was behind us, but we were wrong.

After  doing some research, we have decided on Femara as PCOS sufferers usually respond better. </p>

<p>I have a few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My doctor says we can do a trigger shot that cycle. Should we?</p></li>
<li><p>She says since my thyroid is functioning (TSH normal), I don&#39;t need to be medicated for my thyroid. Any conflicting info?</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t appear to have insulin resistance (BMI &lt;25) and they aren&#39;t going to test me. I would like to get it tested. Should I push for that?</p></li>
<li><p>If my testosterone is high, but no insulin resistance, should I ask about Metformin? I do not want to miscarry again due to high testosterone. </p></li>
<li><p>I already eat pretty healthy and exercise. Any other life style changes I can make? I take prenatals, DHA, calcium, flaxseed and drink red raspberry leaf and spearmint tea. </p></li>
<li><p>Any advice for us? I do not want to waste time or do something that isn&#39;t worth it. We&#39;ve hit our out of pocket max on insurance and we will pay whatever we need to privately. </p></li>
</ol>

Do we have to totally put our life on hold for months to make this happen?</p>

This is my first post after a long while of lurking and upvoting. I'm just having a really hard week. I've had problems (PCOS, cysts, amenorrhoea, unexplained terrible bleeding episodes, etc) since I was 10, so I was expecting having trouble trying to conceive but I guess I never realized how hard it would be. I'm currently trying my last round of Clomid before my doc says we move on to something else. After all the other months with no ovulation, I'm not hopeful and just kind of view it as a necessary last ditch effort just to say we tried. 

Recently, one of my best friends confided in me that she was having trouble getting pregnant. When she told me she wanted to talk to me about it, I felt weirdly relieved that I'm not alone. I hadn't even known they were trying. When she was telling me what was going on with her, I kept thinking that these 'problems' didn't really seem like problems, but I was shutting those thoughts down, saying it's not fair for me to dismiss her problems just because I'm comparing them to mine, and focused on being supportive and giving her the responses I've always wished to get when someone talks to me about my struggles.

Well, last night we went out to dinner and I asked her how it was going and... you guessed it... she's pregnant. It was like their 3rd month of trying. No interventions required at all. It's still really early but definitely pregnant. I'm happy for her but I'm also totally crushed. When I told my husband he looked like someone punched him in the gut. It just gets harder every month that passes.

Also, I feel like a bad person for even feeling this way, but I'm also sort of upset with my friend. Even though I'm sure the things she was interpreting as problems seemed very real to her at the time, I just also feel like it was so shitty to talk to me about it like we were on the same page when now it's clear we weren't. Not that she could have known she would get pregnant right away, but to assume you have problems when you don't.... I don't know, it just sucks. 

My dad also got engaged this week which has also been complicated for me emotionally (the Clomid mood swings aren't helping!) and now he wants to plan a destination wedding and I'm in that whole dance of thinking well, that month could be hard because if I got pregnant this month, I wouldn't be able to travel...... but I also know I probably won't be pregnant this month so I feel silly for even thinking it.

My husband and I decided to see an RE for various testing. Here are the results for everything we have been tested for so far:

- Female and male karyotypes: both normal
- Lupus Anticoagulant: None detected
- Beta-2 Glycoprotein I Ab, IgG/IgM: Negative
- Anticardiolipin Ab, IgG/M: Negative
- STD tests for both of us: All negative
- My A1C: 5.2
- My Vitman D: 48.8
- My Complete Blood Counts: lots of #s here, but all within normal ranges
- Saline sonogram: Normal
- Husband's SA: total amount moving= 349 million; concentration 69; motility= 61%, morphology= 5% (RE said all of it was within normal range...? )
- My Day 3 Blood work, including estrogen, FSH, prolactin, thyroid, and LH: don't have exact numbers, but nurse said they were all within normal ranges

The majority of our testing was uneventful, and did not provide us many answers. However, I did learned that I have an AMH of 10.8. This was exciting at first, but then after extensive Googling (damnit), I realized that this is likely abnormally high. I also had a Day 3 baseline ultrasound last week that showed an antrical follicle count of 26; 14 on one ovary, 12 on the other. As someone who is desperate for answers, I have been thinking a lot about the potential of my having PCOS. The clinic nurse said that this doesn't seem likely, given my ""normal"" hormone and A1C levels. I have always had normal cycles in which I ovulate every time, but then again I had been on the pill since I was 17 years old as of this past November. I have also always had acne since I was a teen, along with some dark hair below my belly button. 

We have a follow-up appointment with our RE on Monday morning to discuss all of the testing and figure out where to go from here. Our nurse had indicated that our RE may suggest trying an IUI.

<p>My husband and I decided to see an RE for various testing. Here are the results for everything we have been tested for so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Female and male karyotypes: both normal</li>
<li>Lupus Anticoagulant: None detected</li>
<li>Beta-2 Glycoprotein I Ab, IgG/IgM: Negative</li>
<li>Anticardiolipin Ab, IgG/M: Negative</li>
<li>STD tests for both of us: All negative</li>
<li>My A1C: 5.2</li>
<li>My Vitman D: 48.8</li>
<li>My Complete Blood Counts: lots of #s here, but all within normal ranges</li>
<li>Saline sonogram: Normal</li>
<li>Husband&#39;s SA: total amount moving= 349 million; concentration 69; motility= 61%, morphology= 5% (RE said all of it was within normal range...? )</li>
<li>My Day 3 Blood work, including estrogen, FSH, prolactin, thyroid, and LH: don&#39;t have exact numbers, but nurse said they were all within normal ranges</li>
</ul>

<p>The majority of our testing was uneventful, and did not provide us many answers. However, I did learned that I have an AMH of 10.8. This was exciting at first, but then after extensive Googling (damnit), I realized that this is likely abnormally high. I also had a Day 3 baseline ultrasound last week that showed an antrical follicle count of 26; 14 on one ovary, 12 on the other. As someone who is desperate for answers, I have been thinking a lot about the potential of my having PCOS. The clinic nurse said that this doesn&#39;t seem likely, given my &quot;normal&quot; hormone and A1C levels. I have always had normal cycles in which I ovulate every time, but then again I had been on the pill since I was 17 years old as of this past November. I have also always had acne since I was a teen, along with some dark hair below my belly button. </p>

<p>We have a follow-up appointment with our RE on Monday morning to discuss all of the testing and figure out where to go from here. Our nurse had indicated that our RE may suggest trying an IUI. What are the advantages of this for someone who seems to fall pregnant without issue, but never develops a fetus and ultimately loses the pregnancy? Any experience with lean PCOS? Any suggestions for tests we&#39;ve missed? Any feedback is always and greatly appreciated. xo</p>

* One day 3 5cell became a morula by day 6, but was not viable
* One day 3 4-cell became a mother fucking **blastocyst** by day 6 ( inside cells poor, outside cells average), and

My wife and I (same-sex couple) have been trying to get pregnant for exactly a year now.  I know it doesn't seem like long compared to some of the stories I've read here (and my heart goes out to you), but it seems long for us.  We had no idea what to expect coming into this.  All we knew was that she was 23, in good health, never had any issues or irregularities with her health, body, etc.  She wanted a baby.  Her own baby.  I wanted it for her.  We expected it to be easy.  We expected it to be quick.  23, healthy, and regular...what could go wrong?  The doctor took some bloodwork...everything looked perfect with the exception of her prolactin level (which they got under control that month).  After IUI 1 failing, we were a bit taken back.  We did some research and we found that it isn't always as easy as we thought.  So we sucked it up, and we tried again.  Failed.  Ok...odds are starting to look more in our favor now...Tried a third time.  Failed.  We decided to get more aggressive, she tried clomid, she tried follistem, she tried natural IUI...failed.  After every medicated cycle, she developed cysts that would take 1-3 months to disappear.  But we kept trying.  Every time, the doctor told us she responded beautifully to the medication.  For some reason...she just wasn't getting pregnant.  

So, 5 failed IUI trials and exactly one year later...we took a break.  We talked about everything we were feeling, and where we wanted to go next.  She said IVF.  I said okay.  

Fast forward to now.  She got baseline tests done.  All her blood work came back.  The doctor calls and leaves her a vm. 
""We got your blood work back today, and we need you to come in as soon as possible to discuss the results.  We found your hormone levels to be a little odd, and it seems that you have an extremely low egg reserve"" ::Hangs up::

What does that even mean?!  

So, we went in and talked to the doctor...this morning.  He showed us her results.  Back in September of 2014, her AMH levels were 1.8 (he said they expected it to be 1.5 or above).  Today, they are 0.32.  Her FSH...14.2 (he said it should be 10 or lower).  

How....on....earth....does a healthy 23 year old woman have that drastic of a change?! Seriously.  How does that happen?  In a year?!  Come on!

He kept saying it was genetic.  But...they are testing her hormone levels...after being on crazy medications for a year that will affect her hormones.  They are tested ovarian stimulation and egg production....when they know she has cysts right now that are hindering it.  Yet, he says this has nothing to do with her results.  Am I wrong?  I understand it's quite possible for me to be wrong, i hardly know anything about this.  But it SEEMS so simple.  I don't know.

Also - there's no way our doctor would be doing anything....sketchy? Right?  I mean...even though we purchased 5 vials up front, and told him if those 5 didnt work we were going to do IVF....he wouldn't ... mess up just to get more money out of us? Right?

I just don't know what to do.  My wife doesn't know what to do.  We just feel defeated and frustrated and angry and even a bit stupid right now.

It just doesn't seem right.  SOMETHING has to be wrong.  Or am I still holding on to hope?  Help.

Oh, and...our doctor told us that the medications were going to be near 10,000...and that doesn't include the procedures.  I just don't know anymore.

I have gotten so much love good vibes from this community, and I want to personally thank all of you who have taken the time to reply to my posts or just read my thoughts. You guys rock!

With that, I wanted to give a little update on what's going on with me, just because I'm feeling really excited and optimistic.

So, I finally did it. I got my referral. AND, as a bonus, I got my OB/GYN to listen to me. He started me on metformin, which is awesome (and yet my stomach is saying it's not so awesome).

I'm nervous, excited, scared, angry, and every other emotion that could possibly be associated with this moment in my life, but there ya have it.

So, I guess my number one question right now would be: How do you guys handle the stomach upset with metformin? Does it go away? I know diet change is going to be the main thing, and I'm definitely working on that part. I've heard that the timed release capsule is easier on your digestive system, but when I mentioned it my doc seemed very reluctant.

Another question: what should I be expecting at my RE appointment? Just a general ""this is what's up and this is our plan of action""? or will it just be more testing? I've only had one HSG done in the past year, but no saline sonogram or anything like that. I just want to be prepared for what's going to be shoved up my vagina. I don't like to be blindsided by those sorts of things lol.

Visited a urologist, and was diagnosed with mild varicocele ( maximum 2.5 mm dilation in both testes) from an ultrasound. Got a testosterone report and semen analysis done.

Testoterone- 745 ng/dl

Semen analysis

Volume: 2 ml
Total sperm count: 90 million/ml

Motility
Rapidly Progressive: 20%
Sluggishly Progressive: 10%
Non Progressive: 10%
Immotile: 60%

Fructose: Positive

Head defect: 8%
Body defect: 2%
Tail defect: 3%

Doctor said that both count and motility is very low. Prescribed me with Coenzyme Q10 60 MG+Elemental zinc 12.5 MG+Levocarnitine 1 GM+Lycopene 2500 MCG tablet for 30 days. And if the sperm quality doesn't improve I will have to undergo a surgery.
