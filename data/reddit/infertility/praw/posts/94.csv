I just missed starting last week as they were only starting long protocol women - some had their injections stopped in March but not all. Was made to feel guilty for daring to ask whether I could start as other ppl had it worse than me - hate rank ordering people's suffering. Short history is I was meant to start early March but my prolactin was too high, having had an MRI for a tumour (clear in March) and then paying to have an appointment with an endocrinologist to get my bromocriptine increased to reduce prolactin. Last week I had loads of nurse  calls and each time I was told something different. Then this morning got a voicemail saying, to just call when my period starts next and they'll TRY to fit me in, even though last week I was told I just need to wait one more month. I ended up having a panic attack listening to the message, being in floods of tears and not being able to eat. Couldn't get through to the nurses' line, so emailed the clinical director - and guess what I got a more reassuring call back. Hate conflict and hate having to shout loud to be heard when the extra stress isn't needed. Can't see how difficult it can be to have a spreadsheet with capacity per day and women due on by date, and their estimated treatment left to see if egg retrieval and collection is possible in advance rather than the day you start your period 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😭😭😭😭😭. Also out we need new virology blood tests as they're only valid for 3 months - not sure when we would have been able to catch a virus in the interim locked in the house and faithful 😤😤😤. I feel like 40% of IVF stress is caused by disorganisation and having to be mega on the ball with the admin and pushing things forward yourself - anyone else? Also feel stressed that other half has a boys night out planned out 4th July (lockdown dependent that has been planned for 6 months that might clash with egg retrieval/sperm sample) and we're both very different in our Covid caution levels - so the potential clash is stressing me out as I'm now mentally planning someone else having to collect me from hospital so he can go out.

I'm sorry if this shouldn't be a standalone post, please let me know if it should go into a thread, I just thought this might be too long. I also apologize if I'm rambling...it has been an emotional weekend. Our diagnostics were on hold due to COVID19 and things are starting to get up and running but I'm facing some choices and I'm not sure where to go from here. It's a bit of an introduction, but mostly hoping for some direction since I am on information overload and completely overwhelmed. We just got our results at the end of last week and I've been down the rabbit hole of research. I have generalized anxiety disorder so it helps me to be informed but I'm not coming up with anything too concrete, which I guess is to be expected but I am looking for some guidance if you have any.

For myself - my blood work looks good. I have Factor V Leiden, heterozygous with no clot history, so it makes some treatment plans a little more difficult. Otherwise my numbers are ok. I had a saline HSG (FemVue) at my OB/GYN and the right tube is open but they couldn't visualize the left tube. I decided to move onto an RE because I had a feeling it was time and they started their initial tests. No repeat HSG due to dye allergy. They performed an ultrasound and checked my uterine blood flow and said that what they saw could indicate adenomyosis, but it wasn't definitive and that it shouldn't impact anything. I've been looking into that and am seeing mixed results in studies so I'm not entirely sure what to think. They attempted a sonohystogram but it seems as if I have some great anatomy because the initial flexible probe didn't work well but the more firm probe couldn't reach my uterus because we discovered my cervix is almost at a right angle, which they tried to manipulate (so much pain) and after much swearing and blood determined it was best to proceed to a hysteroscopy because one of the few things they did see was that I have an arcuate uterus of unknown depth. So now they want to know if I want to have a resection if they determine the arcuate indentation is ""significant"" which they're defining as >1cm. I've read studies for hours and there seems to be no consensus, that an arcuate uterus is kind of a gray area on recommendations so I'm not sure how to proceed.

For my husband - His numbers are ok-ish. Morphology is 1% and motility is 40% but they did a grading and determined they were AB. I'm thinking it makes the most sense to go straight to IVF because our chances seem low for IUI, but I have heard some success stories with IUI and male-factor infertility so I'm tempted to try it.

Any ways, I'm having an anxious and overwhelmed day and basically need an internet hug and some wisdom of some fellow strugglers who might have informed feedback. I've tried talking to my friends but it's hard because they don't understand. I hate that we're all going through this but am so thankful for this sub <3

They attempted a sonohystogram but it seems as if I have some great anatomy because the initial flexible probe didn&#39;t work well but the more firm probe couldn&#39;t reach my uterus because we discovered my cervix is almost at a right angle, which they tried to manipulate (so much pain) and after much swearing and blood determined it was best to proceed to a hysteroscopy because one of the few things they did see was that I have an arcuate uterus of unknown depth. So now they want to know if I want to have a resection if they determine the arcuate indentation is &quot;significant&quot; which they&#39;re defining as &gt;1cm. I&#39;ve read studies for hours and there seems to be no consensus, that an arcuate uterus is kind of a gray area on recommendations so I&#39;m not sure how to proceed.</p>

<p>For my husband - His numbers are ok-ish. Morphology is 1% and motility is 40% but they did a grading and determined they were AB. I&#39;m thinking it makes the most sense to go straight to IVF because our chances seem low for IUI, but I have heard some success stories with IUI and male-factor infertility so I&#39;m tempted to try it.</p>

<p>Any ways, I&#39;m having an anxious and overwhelmed day and basically need an internet hug and some wisdom of some fellow strugglers who might have informed feedback. I&#39;ve tried talking to my friends but it&#39;s hard because they don&#39;t understand. I hate that we&#39;re all going through this but am so thankful for this sub &lt;3</p>

To make matters worse, my fear amplifies my perceived pain, so each shot was incredibly painful long after the needle was out.

I had a breakthrough towards the end of my IVF stim injection phase, ironically on my final day when I had to take all 3 stim meds at the same time (prior to my last trigger shot). Incredibly, these shots were much less painful than my single shots in the past, and I felt far calmer afterwards.

I'm sharing my learnings here in the hopes that I can ease the anxieties of others tackling their fear of needles during an already stressful treatment. This list is an amalgamation of valuable advice I've picked up from other Redditors, plus specific tactics that worked well for me. Thank you so much to everyone who offered support and advice to me! 



MINDSET/MEDITATION

* Guided meditation prior to each shot was helpful! If you don't want to install an app like Headspace, try The Honest Guys Meditation on YouTube...all free videos, and Rick has a wonderfully soothing voice.

* I tried to consider myself as a separate (but allied) entity from my physical body. This helped me reframe the pain as something my body experienced but to which I was simply an empathetic observer (therefore decreasing my perceived pain). I thanked my body for working hard to get me to this point, I apologized for putting her through pain, and assured her we were in this together. I highly recommend reading The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer for more perspective on the consciousness as being separate from the physical body. I attribute this mindset shift as being instrumental in my breakthrough.

* Before and during injections, I most commonly use the 4-7-8 breathing pattern to activate my parasympathetic nervous symptom: 4 sec inhale, 7 sec hold, 8 sec exhale. The counting has an extra bonus of distracting your mind. If this isn't appealing to you, any slow deep breathing will do the trick.

* If possible, allot a short resting period, post-injection. Particularly my Orgalutran shot gave me nausea and headaches, so I was thankful for not needing to rush off to another schedule commitment afterwards.


INJECTION TECHNIQUES

Most of these injection techniques are ones I picked up from Redditors in this sub, as well as in r/stilltrying and r/IVF (thank you!!) I've coloured these tips with my own experience/success with them.

* Consider enlisting your partner or friend to administer the shots. Not only does it take one responsibility off your plate, but it's easier to look away when you're not the one stabbing yourself. My husband did all my shots after I had a panic attack while self-administering my very first injection, and I'm so thankful he could help me in this capacity!

* Ice beforehand. Everyone says this, and it really does help reduce the pain of the initial prick. I used one of those blue lunchbox coolers so the ice wouldn't make a melty mess.

* Inject slowly, at least for subcutaneous sites. This is a piece of advice I received from several sources, and it really does make a difference. Mine were dispersed over about 20sec, although I've heard of success going even slower.

* Insert and remove the needle with speed and confidence. Others have described this action like throwing a dart. Doing it slowly just prolongs the discomfort. This is especially so when removing the needle...doing it slowly causes the skin to cling to the needle which is really painful. In this case, don't forget to grab a cotton ball or gauze to apply pressure on the surrounding skin as you pull out the needle. 

* For subcutaneous injections, try to lift and pinch so you're pinching mostly skin and fat. If you pinch without trying to lift up the fat, you may also pinch underlying muscle, which makes for a more painful shot.


DISTRACTIONS

* Use a vibrator: seriously! This was a gamechanger for me. I discovered a device called Buzzy, which is a cutesy medical tool that uses the Gate Control Theory through a combination of ice and vibration. Essentially, the sensations interrupt the nerve endings before the pain reaches the brain, therefore cancelling (or at least reducing) the pain signal. Now, a Buzzy costs $60 USD which I wasn't prepared to fork over. So I simply iced the spot prior to injection, then used my electric toothbrush handle slightly above the injection site for the vibration (if you only have sex toys on hand, use what you got, girl!) You can check out the Buzzy website for tips on suitable placement depending on where your shot is administered. I really felt a reduction in pain when using the vibration technique.

The following tips are based on overwhelming your five senses with distractions during the actual injection:

* Play music. The best combo for me was calming ""deep sleep"" ambient music during injection, then confidence-building pump up music afterwards. 

* Play a game on your phone. Something straightforward but still requires some concentration, like Candy Crush or Dots.

* Put something in your mouth. For me, it was a small piece of chocolate. Gum or hard candy would work too. Basically something that tastes good can help distract you. Something sweet has the added bonus of releasing endorphins such as dopamine and serotonin, which can help calm you, increase happiness, and reduce pain.


I hope this list helps someone! Feel free to add your own tips in the comments.

I got results yesterday from my second IVM retrieval and wanted to share for anyone interested since there’s less posted about it. 
It was more complicated than last time. 
Basically you can have up to 3 embryo ‘lines’ you’re following: the ones that are mature on the day of retrieval, the ones that mature by the next day and the ones that mature the day after. I didn’t have any that were mature on retrieval this time, so my first set was on the next day (5 eggs) and the ones that matured 2 days after retrieval (15 eggs). 

I don’t know how to link my first cycle while on mobile but it was my last post. 

5/1 CD2 labs E2: 38, P 0.4 L 4,5, R:5.9, L: 8. Start letrozole 5mg and dex nightly 

5/3 225 iu menopur in am

5/5 225 iu menopur am, last night letrozole (5 day total)

5/5 CD6 E 84, P 0.3, L 4,5 R: 11.3, 10.5, 10.3, 8 L: 13.5, 12.3, 9, 8.3. Menopur 225 IU at 7 pm and 10k hcg trigger 10 pm

5/8 retrieved 31 eggs, none mature

5/9 (Day 1 #1) 5 mature eggs were ICSI’d

5/10 (Day 1 #2) 15 more mature eggs were ICSI’d. 5 of the first 5 eggs fertilized. 

5/11 9 of the second 15 eggs fertilized 

5/12 (Day 3 #1) 4 of initial 5 dividing appropriately, one developing slowly

5/13 (Day 3 #2) All 9 embryos dividing well

5/14 (Day 5 #1) 1 5BB ready for biopsy, 3 still growing, 1 arrested 

5/15 (Day 6 #1) 2 continuing to develop but need more time, 1 arrested (Day 5 #2) 

5/16 (Day 7 #1) 2 arrested (Day 6 #2) one 5BB and the rest arrested. 

5/29 5BB Low DNA, 6BB is abnormal 

Lessons learned/Looking back:
1. I stimmed much shorter this cycle. My body responded incredibly strongly to one extra vial of menopur. My RE is probably right, I have nearly 100% chance of OHSS with traditional IVF.
2. A total of 14 were fertilized when last cycle I had 10 fertilized. Idk what this means I think it’s about the same. I was sort of hoping it would mean one more embryo, but obviously that’s not the luck I had. 
3. I thought shorter stims would make better quality eggs than going over, but that may not be the case. Last time I got one 3BB from 28 immature eggs. My two 4AA were both mature the day of retrieval last time. This time I got two eggs from all immature. So about the same. 
4. Following so many clusters of eggs gets confusing. I make a little flow chart for myself to follow. The nice part is you actually get more news on more days. If it’s bad news that sucks bc you get your hopes up more and crushed more. 
5. I think I’ve become addicted to updates. I fiend for them all morning and as soon as I get my hit I’m satisfied for like 15 minutes, but then I just want more. Not so healthy. 
6. I have so many eggs, and they’re just so shitty. 
7. It was weird bc the 5BB that was sent for PGS testing was originally reported as a 5AB by our embryo lab. But I guess that changed or something. 

I’m pretty bummed. But I can’t say this was unexpected, this cycle was just not going well. But at work so I’m trying not to think about what a waste this cycle was. Out of pocket.
I said originally I would go straight to transfer even if we got no embryos from this cycle, but now I’m panicking. We already started our
ERA cycle so I guess I’m doing that.

Edit: I know the Low DNA isn’t totally out of the running. I would probably not re-biopsy and just transfer it, as a gut reaction.

I’m not looking for an actual diagnosis here since this is reddit, but definitely curious if anyone else is in a similar position and can offer any clues or open to just ranting about this with people who understand.

I’m 30F now, but I never got my period as a teen. No history of eating disorders, no extreme sports, always been average weight for my height (5’9”). Very underdeveloped in terms of chest and body hair growth. When I was 18, enough was enough and I went to the gynecologist. They ran a ton of tests on me, CAT scan of my head looking for a pituitary tumor (none found), MRI of my pelvis (everything was there, just very small and underdeveloped), genetic testing (came back XX), blood tests (low estrogen, low FSH, low LH), everything. 

They gave up and prescribed me the combined pill birth control, told me to look into it later when I wanted to have children. It worked to put me through puberty, still have small/medium boobs and not a lot of hair, but it’s there now. I also finally started getting my period. With my period came terrible symptoms, really bad cramps, headaches, body aches, brain fog, etc, I basically can’t fully function for twoish days out of the month when the cramps hit. 

Life went on, at 25 I started getting ocular migraines. After that, I switched to the mini pill, bc the WHO that says you’re at greater risk of stroke on the combined pill if you get migraines. When I switched pills, I stopped getting my period, but was very tired/ low energy all the time no matter my sleep schedule and started getting hot flashes. At some point, I also stopped getting migraines, I had them for ~3 years and then never again. 

Around 28, I went off BC entirely (still no period), but stayed sexually active with my husband w/o protection, after a year of that with no result, we went to see the RE. Husband is totally normal, fertility-wise, genetic testing came back great for both of us. They ran all the same tests they did when I was 19 (with the same results) and she told me that my body isn’t producing estrogen naturally (literally zero, like a post-menopausal woman, hello hot flashes), and I am not ovulating so I have no cycle, and I have a super tiny uterus but with a normal amount of eggs in the ovaries. She said we’d grow my uterus with estradiol, then do hormone treatments, and she was sure they’d get me pregnant (wow does that sentiment ring in my head, wish she’d never said that). 

Couple months of Estradiol, I feel FANTASTIC, I have energy, no more hot flashes, it’s basically amazing. Uterus grows to a normal size over a few months! Now we have to get follicles to mature. She starts me on Provera (which gave me a nightmare blood hellstorm for 20 days) and  Letrozole pills. No response, so now I am on injectables. I’m terrified of needles, the first day I cried so much and my hand was shaking when I did it, giant bruise. But I’ve been on them for maybe like ~20 days now and also getting blood drawn/ultrasound every few days, so I’m very proud of myself for handling that needle anxiety. Started with a half a vial of Menopur, no response, up the dosage to a whole vial, no response, add in 50 units of mini HCG (now 2 needles a day! My stomach looks like a pincushion), no response, up the Menopur to 2 vials a day and now this is where I’m at. I spoke to my dr and her plan is to keep upping the dose until I respond (or not as the case may likely be).

I have another ultrasound tomorrow, I feel just... defeated and like no one actually understands what the root cause of this is. My dr is shocked that I am not responding to Menopur. I’m also tired all the time and hot flashy again because estrogen is at zero (I am having one right now, it’s like they KNOW I’m talking about them). Is this mystery normal?? Is there no scrappy Grey’s Anatomy dr that wants to actually find out what’s wrong with me? (Lol) I just feel like without a diagnosis, I’m alone and I wonder what will happen if they even do get me pregnant, will I be able to carry a baby when my hormones are so unresponsive? 

Anyway, I would love ANY thoughts from people who are going thru something similar or know someone who has. I feel like I have exhausted the internet and gone down so many rabbit holes.

(Lol) I just feel like without a diagnosis, I’m alone and I wonder what will happen if they even do get me pregnant, will I be able to carry a baby when my hormones are so unresponsive? </p>

<p>Anyway, I would love ANY thoughts from people who are going thru something similar or know someone who has. I feel like I have exhausted the internet and gone down so many rabbit holes. Thanks for listening. ❤️</p>

64,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey, guys.  I am in a bit of a conundrum with my uterus and not sure what to do next.  The TLDR is that I have a history of uterine scarring with the last clear-out in January 2020, but I am now having super light periods even while taking estrogen and I am not sure if I should go into another FET.  

First, some relevant background: I was diagnosed with a large uterine septum in April 2019.  I had a resection surgery (hysteroscopy plus a laparoscopy to screen for endo and kidney issues) in May 2019 and recovered for two months before trying again.  I did two IUIs and a natural cycle, which all failed to result in pregnancy.  I moved to IVF in November 2019.  During my IVF monitoring appointments, my RE noticed scar tissue/blockages in my uterus and said I would need a corrective hysteroscopy before doing an embryo transfer.  I did that hysteroscopy in January 2020, recovered for a month, and then moved into my first FET cycle in late February/early March.  FET was with a highly-graded PGS-tested embryo (I do not know the exact grade because I do not want to look at the Natera report and know the sex of my embryos).  Lining check 6 days before transfer after about 20 days of Estrace was 7.3 mm.  That FET failed to result in pregnancy.  We were benched for COVID in April and I did an ERA/Receptiva earlier this month.  We are now ready to go into our second FET but I am having weird periods that make me really nervous my uterus is scarring again.  

I should add that I have always had light periods, like maximum 2-3 days of bleeding and always with a lot of brown gunk before and after.  After my hysteroscopy in January 2020 and FET in March 2020, I had heavier periods, like 4-5 days, which is probably explained by being on estrogen and having the scar tissue cleared out.  In April 2020, though, we tried naturally and I had a positive OPK on CD13.  My period was super light that cycle.  I only saw bright red blood one time while wiping, and never really enough to fill a pad or tampon.  I chalked that up to not being able to produce a thick enough lining on my own (i.e. without estrogen), which I pretty much already knew.  Then I did an ERA earlier this month, and my last lining check 6 days before biopsy after 20 days of Estrace was 7.5-8 mm.  I had a rough biopsy experience with the NP suctioning out three times and saying things like ""uh, I am only getting blood clots.""  She assured me she got a sufficient sample, though.  Last week I get my period and it is similarly light and crappy.  One day of lots of brown gunk (enough to fill up a pad), and then 2 days of very very light bright red (not enough to fill up a pad or tampon).  This has me worried that my uterus is re-scarring. 

I told my RE about my concerns and he offered a hysteroscopy or saline sono to check for scarring.  He also said my light period this past month during the ERA cycle could be explained by the biopsy--they took out a lot of tissue.  He said he thought it was unlikely the scarring was back because I am still getting pretty good lining.  I do not want to do another hysteroscopy if I don't have to.  We eventually settled on a saline, which I am doing next week.  Am otherwise starting Estrace as if we are going into a FET. 

I have 11 embryos in the freezer--8 PGS normals, 1 with a 20% chance of Turner's syndrome, and 2 untested.  

I guess my questions are:

\-Do you think it is likely that my light period this last cycle was due to a rough biopsy or is it indicative of more scarring?

\-For those who have a history of scarring, how quickly has it come back for you?

\-Assuming the saline comes back clear, would you move into another FET cycle if you were me?  Or should I go for the ""gold standard"" and do a hysteroscopy?

I am starting to get a ""this just isn't working"" feeling.  I have never been pregnant, even after 1.5 years in medical treatment, and now I feel shitty because it's like I can't even get my period to function properly.  My husband and I are starting to give serious thought to a gestational carrier, but my RE assures me it is not time for that yet.

The hardest thing about COVID for me has been the delay in fertility treatments....I have an irregular cycle that if I HAD to put an average on would be somewhere around 30-45 days. I finally had all stars aligned and was scheduled to start meds on 3/13....but our clinic closed. I had a perfect cycle...28 days in April...but the clinic was not open yet.

Now I am in an active cycle and on day 35....the clinic called and said that they are opening and want to get me on the schedule since it is busy fitting all the canceled cycles in. Put since my period still hasn't come yet, they want to start a 10 day course of Provera....which I have never taken in last 2 IVFs. Catch is that I have had a positive OPK on day 31, day 32, and day 33....forgot to test day 34. Clinic thinks the positives could be false due to PCOS and would recommend Provera so that I can get on the schedule....but I am torn because it seem counterproductive to the positive OPK that I just received. We have been actively trying throughout the month and specifically as a result of the positive OPKs.

These decisions are the thing I hate most about infertility. I already feel like my body is inadequate because it can't get pregnant...and with every decision that is put before me, I agonize and feel inadequate to decide. The only pregnancy was a FET that was ectopic at 9 weeks and I had to have my right tube removed (July 2019).

I am so grateful something like this exists. 

I am 29 years old. My husband is 31. We have no genetic issues, normal sperm, normal egg count, normal blood work for both, and yet we have completed 
1 round timed intercourse with 5 days 50mg clomid+ 5 days 100mg clomid+ ovidrel
1 round IUI with 5 days 100 mg clomid + Pregnyl
1 round IUI with 17 days follistim injections (between 50-75ml) + Pregnyl
All negative results.
We are currently on our 3rd round IUI using 5 days of 2.5 letrozole + Pregnyl. Still waiting for those follicles to mature. 

We are currently preparing for IVF should this round not work. 

Each round has had its own different set of side effects. HOT FLASHES ARE THE WORST. Headaches and fatigue are others. Emotional disconnection from my husband is also a side effect. One I wasn’t prepared for and not on the prescription labels. 

I have had an extremely difficult time finding support. I have been looking in all the wrong places. I have family and friends that “try” but simply don’t understand the infertile journey and it’s hardships. “Just get drunk and have sex!” 
“You just need to relax! Once you stop thinking about it, it will happen”
“Just don’t get your hopes up. Just wait for IVF”
“Maybe God has a different plan for you!”
“You should feel lucky you don’t have kids during this quarantine!”
“You should eat/drink/ do this (put your feet up the wall, run around in circles for 30 minutes a day, etc), it really helps with infertility”
A lot of sentences starting with “you should” and “just” .... and when I ask for real support and try to really discuss how I’m feeling or how their support isn’t helpful, I’m selfish, too emotional, too controlling. 

I could really use encouragement. I hope I find that here.

Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.

**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down.

My ex partner and I were trying to conceive for over 3 years. I have PCOS. We did clomid. I lost a lot of weight to get my BMI down to 29. We just started treatment (first round of injectables) and then unfortunately separated. 

We were entitled to 6 rounds of injectables (1 of which we used) and 2 rounds of IVF. 

One of my greatest fears when separating was that I may not be allowed nhs treatment again should I need it with a new partner, despite not using all of my rounds. 

A few years on and my now partner and I have reached the point of trying. I’m still emotionally scarred from the process last time, but at least I know what to expect. 

The only thing is, I’m so worried I may not be able to get treatment because of my previous circumstances. I was wondering if anyone had any insight, or went through any similar to this?

I will speak to me doctor when I’m ready, but he isn’t the most sensitive and I’m trying to preempt what’s going to be said to safeguard my feelings.

If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Infertility includes: primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.

I am on cycle day 1 after miscarrying twins in April. This was my fourth miscarriage. We found after testing the tissue there were no chromosomal abnormalities. 

The change my current RE is proposing is to add Lovenox to our frozen cycle. He continues to say that there are likely abnormalities and that even though the results came back that way, there really could still be abnormalities (then what is the purpose of testing?). He is also proposing genetic testing. I agree genetic testing is a good idea since we have not done that yet but I'm finding it hard to believe all of our losses are due to that - especially after we made it somewhat far with the twins (8w3d, 9w1d -- two strong ultrasounds with good growth/heartbeats at 6w and 7w5d).

I've gotten a number of opinions and the RE I'm leaning towards going to wants to do an endometrial biopsy around the time implantation would occur to see what is going on at that point in time. He believes there could be something with the uterus/implantation piece such as chronic inflammation at that time, something with natural killer cells, etc. This, of course, will not be covered by insurance... ugh.

Does anyone have experience with this? Or heard of anyone finding something and went on to have success? My husband is not sold on this, but I feel it is worth exploring. There are conflicting views based on what I've read.

164,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Thank you to everyone who offered recommendations and advice to my question about MTHFR mutation. 

I just got off a Zoom with my doctor. She reviewed the report and told me the type of mutation I have isn’t usually a concern. If I had homozygous mutation(s) she would recommend a 5-MTHF supplement and recommended Theralogix if I’m worried about it. I happen to already be taking the Theralogix Prenatal Complete, which has a 5-MTHF so she is definitely not concerned. 

She thinks my bigger hurdle is that I’m ovulating too late (day 30 naturally and day 20 when we did 5 day 5 mg letrozole). Since I have had two chemicals in the past she is going to do some recurrent loss testing, just to rule anything out. We’re increasing how long I take the 5mg letrozole to CD 3-12 rather than 3-7 to try to get me to ovulate closer to day 14. She also offered trying IUI. 

We went through this process with a different doctor back in 2016-2017. However, that doctor didn’t do ANY testing. I did TI and IUIs. We took a break after about 8 months because my PCOS was rampant and I was having anxiety attacks. I lost about 80 lbs., got my PCOS under control, changed my diet, started exercising, etc. and we met with our new doctor about 2 months ago. She wanted to basically start over rather than jump straight to IVF because, in her words, looking at my chart from the other clinic in 2016 and my chart now with updated labs, she’s looking at two entirely different patients basically so if we weren’t in a huge rush to jump straight to IVF she wanted to see how TI and possibly IUI would work first. My current cycle (I’m on day 32 and should start CD 1 within the next two days or so) is my first cycle since restarting treatments. Next cycle we’ll do the 10 days of letrozole and either TI or IUI, depending on what my husband wants to do (I don’t care either way).",t2_4xf892zh,False,,0,False,Update re MTHFR Mutation,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_go63u4,False,dark,0.55,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1590126628.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Thank you to everyone who offered recommendations and advice to my question about MTHFR mutation. </p>

I have heterozygote mutation of MTHFR C677T, MTHFR 03 P39P, and MTHFR A1298C. I am forcing myself to stop searching the interwebs because everything looks pretty bleak in regard to having all three.

Backstory:
I saw a woman post in another fertility group that she had to stop treatments because her MTHFR mutation caused recurrent implantation failure and recurrent loss. It reminded me that I had the raw data from my Ancestry.com DNA sample analyzed and the report mentioned I had an MTHFR mutation. When I went back to look at the report after seeing that post I saw that I had THREE MTHFR mutations, something I must have overlooked last year when I first got the report because I had no idea what it was.

I reached out to my fertility clinic, providing a copy of the report and asking if I should be worried and if fertility treatments are even a viable option for us. The response I got from the nurse was “Thank you for bringing this to our attention and providing the report. [doctor] would like to speak with you about this.

I would be lying if I told you I haven’t mixed up the days of the week that start with “t” a hundred times. I’ve called the oven a microwave repeatedly and I am convinced 7x3 is 28. (Spoiler alert, it’s 21). All these hormones are making me... well... kinda dumb? I’m dumb but happy. Happy we are finally getting the chance to try. 
After making whoopy for a year, my husband was diagnosed with severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. OAT-S for short. His initial total count was about a million sperm. The second recheck showed 1.25 million sperm— all of which are “handicapped”. 
They don’t swim, and if they do, it’s in circles. They don’t have tails, or they have funky heads. Needless to say, We were crushed. My husband is a 31 year old 6’2” ex professional wakeboarder. He is in fantastic shape, incredibly healthy and is the nicest person you’ll ever meet. I am a 29 year old nurse practitioner with apparently, nothing wrong with me. 
What I wouldn’t give to be the one with the issue. 
He didn’t need that news.
At that time his father was entering the final stages of his battle with terminal pancreatic cancer. He passed away in April at the age of 57. I am still beside myself after witnessing the damage cancer does to a person, and the ripple effect is has on loved ones.

Talk about a lot of grief all at once.

We started our IVF/ICSI journey in January. Test after test checking to make sure my lady bits were in tip top shape. Everything checked out for me, which almost made me feel worse? I wanted to be on the same plane as him so he wouldn’t feel like it was all his fault. Men take this really hard, and there’s nothing worse than this kind of diagnosis happening to the sweetest person on earth. 

Why does it seem like the kindest people on the planet are dealt CRAPPY FERTILITY CARDS. Who the fuck is dealing these fertility cards out because I’d like to place a formal complaint.

I started my stims last Friday. 150gonal in the morning with 150 menopur at night. Ganirelix was added on day 5. 
The US yesterday showed my left ovary was being a boss bitch and had 13 healthy looking follicles (team left ovary! Amirite!?!) meanwhile, right ovary is still asleep and has only produced... drum roll.....5 follicles. Cool. 
I put right ovary in timeout. Left ovary got chick fil a.

I am LUCKY to have that many at all, and I know that. 
We are LUCKY that he has some sperm to work with. 
We are LUCKY to have the strong marriage we do to get through this.

BUT HOLY FUCK THIS SHIT IS KINDA FUCKING HARD MANG.

AND HOW BOUT THIS DAMN COVID SHIT. YOU’RE TELLING ME HE CANT COME WITH ME TO ANY APPOINTMENTS OK THATS FUCKING STUPID. HI. WE LIVE TOGETHER AND MAKEOUT DAILY. IF HE HAS IT, ME TOO BRO.
Whatever. Rant over.

Here’s the questions I’ve got: 

1. What should I expect on ER day? 
2. What should I expect in the weeks after as far as emotions / hormone swings go? Will I be a damn basket case? I’ve been quite impressed with my stability with an estradiol count of >5000. I cry when I see pretty trees but that’s about it. 
3. What should I expect for the period that comes after the ER? (We are doing FET) 
4. Again, who the fuck is dealing these fertility cards out because I’d like to make a formal complaint.

I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this. Infertility can be an isolating world, especially when it’s MFI & your husband doesn’t want to tell anyone, which is understandable and I don’t resent him for that. But DAMN, that’s hard.

FINALLY, anyone else out there get PISSED OFF when you comment on a cute kid and the parent is like “oh yea? Watch them for a day for me. It’s birth control!”

If you saw the sub re: the Facebook ""10 Days of Motherhood Challenge,"" I've created my own ""10 days of Infertility"" challenge. The template I'm going to use for each day is below. I'll be adding pictures of my med bin, spouse and I in our fundraiser shirts, etc. Feel free to join me!!! (PS if you aren't religious or comfortable asking for prayers, you can ask for thoughts, donations, or take that part out) (PSS I'm not affiliated with RESOLVE but they have a bunch of easy to use advocacy tabs on their site!)

Day 1 of the 10 day ""Day in the Life of Infertility Challenge."" For my friends who are struggling with or who have survived infertility: post one picture a day from your journey. Day 1/10: a picture of [spouse] and I after we received a shirt from our fundraising campaign. It absolutely takes a village, and we can't wait to tell Baby [Last Name] about everyone who helped bring them home to us some day &lt;3 

Does this post make you feel uncomfortable? Sad for me and my friends going through something similar? Pained over past infertility trauma? Here's how you can help! First, we would love if you could pray for and over us- [husband] and I, and our embryos, as well as our friends on similar journeys! Next, please head over to RESOLVE.org and fill out their easy-to-use legislative action form. In a few clicks, you can share with your governor why YOU think it's important for every American to have access to reproductive healthcare related to infertility.

Last night I stayed up until 3am researching Fertility clinics. The reviews on most were mixed with good and bad experiences. 
Trying to find an affordable place isn’t easy either. 
These places are really taking advantage of people who so desperately want babies. 
Do you ever get over the creepy feeling of having to shell out so much cash for trying to have a baby?


What were determining factors for the places you chose and what procedure to have?


Are there any good doctors that really do care about you and not just look at you like a cash cow?


Do any of you have suggestions as to where I should go?


I’m in the greater Seattle area. So far I’ve looked at options from Colorado, New York, Barbados, Mexico. 


What are some things I could do to prepare for this journey now? 

What are things you did or didn’t do when you started out?

We were just doing checkups to prepare for TTC starting in December when shock results returned and low AMH figure came up. The specialist at the time then fast tracked us straight to IVF - so we haven’t even had a chance to TTC

IVF #4 (May) - HGH stims - 1 follicle at 20mm by d9 - egg collection - no eggs

My left ovary is the money maker but it was the one adhered to my bladder (and I think bowel, too!) 

Prior to this, I was ‘unexplained.’ I have my post op comprehensive meeting sometime next week, and we will go through the copious amounts of lab work. In 2019, we did 2 egg retrievals. I’m 28. Both resulted in 4 poor quality embryos. From the first retrieval, we did 2 transfers. One failed, and one ended in early loss. We froze the 4 from the second retrieval.

I’m just looking for stories that are similar to mine, so I can manage my expectations. Does anyone here have a background like mine? Where did your story go from here?

My husband and I are both carriers of a rare genetic condition which is why we are diving into IVF. Our history is unassisted success 2 times, the first being how we found out about our genetic status and the 2nd unfortunately ended in a TFMR at 13 weeks due to being affected. We have now decided to pursue IVF with PGT - M and HLA matching. We spoke with an RE last year when we were considering IVF and got some basic blood work and ultrasound done. My AMH was 3.8 and the RE said I had great ovarian reserve looking at the ultrasound. My husband has his semen collection scheduled for Monday. 

Unfortunately we are completely out of pocket for IVF and genetic testing which means that after talking to the clinic everything for our first cycle will run us about $40k (we are doing PGT-M and HLA matching which ups the cost some). We can really only afford 1 cycle and that’s with pulling money out of retirement to do it. 

What questions/tests etc should I be asking for to make sure that I give this the best chance at success that I can? Due to our history I am not anticipating any fertility issues but I know anything could pop up. Our TFMR was 2 weeks ago and I have an appointment at the RE next Thursday, I also had a video appointment last week. He did not seem concerned about waiting any particular amount of time after the TFMR to start a retrieval cycle and I am also ready to get started ASAP but I’m worried that starting too soon might decrease the likelihood of success on that cycle, is this something to be worried about? Also, should I tell our RE that this is our one shot financially? Would that change their approach? I’ve heard that the first cycle of IVF can be largely diagnostic but I don’t feel like we have that luxury, anything I can do about that?

I would appreciate some advice or general thoughts as I have been given different advice on which protocol to take. My results are AMH 17.6 pmol/l, TSH 3.7, FSH 3.1 and I had 9 follicles in each ovary at my most recent scan. I am 35.

I had been due to start IVF in April on the National Health Service (fully funded) and was advised that I would be starting on the Long Form Protocol. All fertility treatment in the UK has been cancelled since we went into lockdown in March. I was worried that given the demands on the healthcare system, our NHS clinic wouldn't reopen for months (all non elective procedures in the UK on the NHS have been cancelled so it seemed likely that waiting lists to restart would be much longer than a private clinic) so I started looking at private clinics as a 'just in case' scenario.

This week I have virtual consultations with 2 seperate clinics who had advised they reccomend the short protocol based on my test results (they used the medical notes sent over from my original clinic). 

The private clinics have explained why they prefer short protocols but I wanted to ask from people who have actually gone through treatment if there is any particular benefit for one or any risks/side effects you experienced as it seems odd to have been given contradictory advice. Are success rates any different? Happily I have been proven wrong about my original clinic taking ages to open as they are also in the process of opening up in the next few weeks though haven't confirmed exact timelines yet. Should I be challenging my protocol with them?
