Just started TTC & husband isn't ready for a sperm check. He wants to try & see first for 6 months to a year. 
According to what I've read, husband has anywhere from a 50% to 95% chance for normal sperm 2 years after chemo. That's a pretty broad statistic & since testicular cancer is relatively rare, there aren't that many studies on it. 
I'm nearing age 32 & my periods seem to slowly be getting lighter & it's worrying me. I am wondering if it's worth pushing him for an SA or if okay to wait. Maybe the sperm is most likely normal?
Any info or experience would be appreciated!  Thanks in advance!

New edit : I want to say how much I appreciate all of your answers. It has been a little over two years since my husband has finished chemo. Yesterday, he had his 2-year follow-up, which is why I posted in the first place. Great news! His tumor markers and hormones are completely normal. We talked to the oncologist about his fertility chances and whether we should get an SA right now, but she said to try for a few months and go from there. She said that with three cycles of BEP chemo and his normal blood markers, we have a good chance! However, we'll keep paying the sperm bank - just in case!

Initially, I spent a lot of time doing ovulation tracking by LH test and BBT.  Everything seemed normal and I was ovulating, but month after month I would fail to get pregnant.  My husband does want kids, but he has never expressed any concern by my failing to get pregnant.  He never expressed interest in all the at-home testing he saw me doing.

After 1.5 years, I finally decided to see a doctor on my own.  I did the blood work, ultrasound, and HSG and everything came back normal.  My husband did not volunteer to come with me for any of that, and I didn't ask him (He works 50 hours/week). 

My husband then did a semen analysis and they found that he had low sperm count (2.4 million), low motility (12%),  and the morphology was 4.

The doctor advised him to get a second semen analysis and more bloodwork done, and to also see a urologist.  That was 2 months ago.  He is very busy with work and it's hard to reach the hospital's appointment line and to obtain an appointment.  I tell him he needs to keep calling. The longer he puts it off, the worse the problem will get because I'm not getting any younger.  He somehow manages to keep putting it off, and to be fair, the hospital is also making it difficult for him by telling him they are fully booked and he needs to call back.  Or they say they will call back but don't.

I'm getting frustrated and just feel like giving up sometimes.   I'm worried that we won't be able to conceive and I wish my husband would show some concern too, especially now that we found it's a male infertility problem.  I feel like I'm the only one who is trying.  His blasé attitude just makes me depressed and want to give up.

I don't know if he's having a hard time facing the fact that he may have an infertility problem.

Hi all,

I’d like to know what the plan is for post transfer support to help my body hold onto the embryo and support implantation. Given my rare combination of hypergonadatropic hypergonadism, hashimotos, and pituitary failure I don’t think a simple transfer will be sufficient and I am startled that in addition to the extremely simple FET protocol (not including any antihistamine or immune suppression etc) theres been no discussion of planning. 

What is the plan? Will I supplementing 
estrace after in addition to PIO? How about HCG? steroids? I’m concerned that these topics have not been thought through by Dr X and your other doctors. Or if they have - great— please share, I need to be updated. Who can talk to me today if I come in to wait to discuss this with X Y and Z?

I have the sensation that it’s a wait and see  passive approach like we are simply winging it with the basic protocol but my case is really different. Given that it took us more or less 3 trial and error stim cycles over a year to get the  embryos we have now I think advance planning is of the highest importance and given that I’m not seeing that happening I wanted to kick the discussion off. 

Is the assumption that my body will simply kick on and do its job if the progesterone level is right? I feel that’s naive and unlikely given that I don’t have an LH surge / have never ovulated.  

Please let me know about timing for an in person chat or call. I will come in later today around 11am to sit and wait to talk to a doctor if I haven’t heard from you. 

Thank you.

Just a little background, here is a story written * **trigger warning** * days after my wife's MMC after trying for close to 3 years. https://www.reddit.com/r/stilltrying/comments/80ysfd/our_story_so_far/

Since then we've tried multiple cycles with clomid and one with another medication I cant remember the name of, as well as one cycle of IUI to no avail. We finally decided that we were ready to bite the IVF bullet, but after looking at the packages through a third party, were torn. We can get one fresh cycle for around $9000 or 2 cycles with a money back deal for $19000. Our original plan was to go with the 2 cycle because you get 2 fresh cycles and unlimited frozen cycles (as long as you have extra embryos to freeze), and if you do not bring a baby home after all of that you get 50% back. But we then realized that if we get pregnant on the first cycle, that money will not go towards another cycle in the future and the contract is over. But the single cycle does not cover any frozen cycles and is over as soon as the first cycle is complete. 

I should add that we arent made of money and can barely afford the 2 cycle (it would take us more than a handful of years to pay off) so the single cycle is enticing, but we also have pretty bad luck up to this point. Any opinions are extremely appreciated, thank you all in advance.

After my first IVF treatment, I developed ringing in my ears (tinnitus). There is no cause; I’m in my late 30s, and have never been exposed to loud noise. It never stops, and it’s been 6 months now. It sucks.

Fun fact: there’s pretty much nothing you can do about tinnitus. Saw an ENT, had an MRI, he shrugged. Also, tinnitus is very frequently accompanied by hearing loss.

So of course, I go to Google. I discover there are drugs that can cause hearing loss called ototoxic drugs; they include estrogen and progesterone! Clomid. Even birth control pills.

So now I’m like, wtf, did ivf drugs just give me permanent hearing damage?? I’m about to start round two and I’m terrified that I could hurt my ears even more.

Has anyone had this experience, or know anything about hormones and ototoxicity?? Thank you :))

I am 38 years old with multiple tests showing high FSH (47 two years ago, 18, 17 and now 15), one test showing a very low AMH (0.08) and one ultrasound showing 3-4 follicles total.

&#x200B;

My RE wanted me to start Clomid and Metapur this month after getting my recent ultrasound, but I wanted to meet a few new gynecologists and another RE just to get more opinions and start next month.

&#x200B;

I just met with a new gynecologist today and he basically said he doesn't think there's much hope of conceiving on my own or IVF even working.  He said we may want to save our money and go straight for a donor egg, and my husband seemed open to this idea.  He thinks that the RE wants me to try the Clomid and Metapur to see if I respond at all and to kind of just prove that they tried it, because it's a pretty hopeless situation.

&#x200B;

I just feel so defeated.  I don't understand how at 38 my FSH and AMH can be so terrible.  I don't understand how this happened.  I even talked with the doctor about blaming myself for having so much stress and anxiety and he said that actually anxiety would make my FSH go down so it's not that at all.  And my husband was incredibly supportive and told me never to blame myself.

I'm home now in tears because I'm just so upset at my body.  And I don't know what path to take next.  I'm terrified of medications, hormones and procedures.  I rarely take anything more than Tylenol....  And to know about the poor success rates with my issues and all the money it may cost...

110,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all, it's been a long time. I just really needed to vent to someone who might understand a little better. In fairness to him, my husband does try to understand but he has never been the most emotionally sensitive guy so I know he doesn't mean any potential insensitivity or misunderstanding. This might be a bit of a jumble word-vomit kind of post, so I apologise in advance. Also, compared to the ordeals I've seen many of the members here go through, this is a very minor complaint and I know that so I'm sorry to gripe about small beans, but my infertility journey only really began in my mind fairly recently.  

Okay, so...Alcohol is a rare treat where we live. Not only is it expensive and heavily regulated, but my in-laws don't approve of it so we keep a tight lid on that stuff ordinarily. Christmas is coming up and my favourite cider was on offer so my husband picked me up some which was a lovely gesture. Unfortunately, I'm now hesitant to drink it and explaining why is quite difficult. Ever since my very early teens, my menstrual cycles have been very infrequent up until I was around 16 when they stopped completely and I was finally diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome. For the past year and a half, I've lost some weight and that has helped me to finally start ovulating again, albeit infrequently. To be precise, I usually have a period approximately every 2 months, give or take a week, more regular than I have ever been which feels pretty good to me. 

With that in mind, I should have started at the beginning of December. Now we're almost 3 weeks in and still nothing. My heart is screaming ""maybe it finally happened!"", because my husband and I have been officially trying for two years, and have had unprotected 'if it happens, it happens' sex for 4 in total. My head, on the other hand, is being rational and frank about it because I know that realistically I'm probably just missing a period and in another month or two I'll have another one. Meanwhile, I jump at every potential symptom of pregnancy with hope and excitement, wanting to enjoy the feeling that maybe I am rather than wallow in the harsh reality that I'm almost certainly not. 

Now that we're getting into the full swing of the holidays, I've been wanting to dip into my little cider stash but I'm holding back on the off chance that there's a little life I'm responsible for. My husband said that there's a very simple way to settle this; Just take a pregnancy test. The idea has obviously come up before when I have been a little late or had some weird sickness or symptoms, but it has never proven necessary so I have never had one before. And I \*\*REALLY\*\* don't want to. I think as far as my husband is concerned, the test will either tell me what I'm hoping and I can rejoice in that, or it will tell me what I already think I know and I can put this hoping, wishing and abstaining from yummy cider behind me. 

But it isn't that simple. Just the thought of having to see a negative result and face a physical representation of my own inadequacy is enough to bring me to tears. Even though I know the result will be to just tally another month in the failure column, I think to see a test say 'no' will emotionally destroy me. I can't bring myself to go to the store for a test without wanting to cry, but I know I could feel worse in the end if I allow myself to keep this hope of a minute chance I could be pregnant. I'm 99.99% sure that I'm not, so facing that shouldn't be so hard. I feel incredibly silly and just needed to get that out of my system. My husband is a very analytical man, very matter-of-fact, so I don't think he understands this inner conflict of mine and I really can't blame him. I don't fully understand it either.

I saw the gynecological oncologist on Monday. Right after, I ended up in the hospital for three days because I could not stop throwing up or having diarrhea, or I would have updated sooner. My fertility doctor thinks the vomiting and and diarrhea are because of the hormones, and the fact that they could only retrieve eggs from the one ovary. The side with my bad ovary is still very painful and bloated. She said by this weekend it'll start to get better. Yesterday was the first day in a while I didn't vomit at all.

The oncologist gave me a bad impression. For right now, I'm scheduled for a CT scan in January after my ovaries have returned to normal size. I see her the following week but she thinks surgery is my only option. She said she isn't sure if it's a benign tumor, a pre cancer tumor, or a cancerous tumor. So she said to plan on surgery for late January or early February. And that chances are, my one ovary will go with whatever the mass is. She also mentioned that there's a cyst on my right ovary, which nobody had mentioned before, and that it might have to go as well. 

I didn't get into it in my last post, but I don't have my colon or rectum. My surgeon made me a fake one out of my small intestines, called a j pouch. Basically, it's a place for poop to chill before I poop it out of my butt. It doesn't work as well as a rectum, but it does its job. 

I don't mind surgery, honestly. But the oncologist went on to say that it has to be open surgery through my existing 9 inch long scar, and that there's gotta be a whole team of doctors ready to work because I'll probably lose part of my bowels because I have so much scar tissue and that it's possible I'll lose my j pouch. I know she has to warn me of that possibility, but she made it seem like it was inevitable. All while I was trying not to puke and poop right there in her office. 

I'm making an appointment with a gynecological oncologist at the hospital my colorectal surgeon works at to see what she says. If anyone is going to be working on my bowels, I want it to by my surgeon who knows me and who knows what's been done in there already and will do everything possible to save my j pouch and what's left of my bowels. And I want an oncologist who is reassuring, not who goes to worst case scenario right off the bat. 

I also understand that scar tissue can be an issue but I do want to make sure that having an open surgery after everything I've been through makes sense. Or if there's a way for it to be laproscopic in any way.

121,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi. I am the husband whose wife has a pretty strong case of PCOS. She has only ever had maybe 4 natural cycles. The rest have been assisted with a med. No idea how to help the core issue (the PCOS) so we have had to resort to using meds to try to get pregnant.

We have done I believe 5 cycles now of super ov, where ovulation actually worked, and instead of doing insemination we have just tried to fertilize the egg the normal way. Only one time we've tested positive for hcg but then bleeding came. We've had 2 other scenarios where bleeding happened with a positive home test right at implantation time as well. My job sucks, it keeps me away for 5 days a week and strong pain in my back (as well as the Natural non-pot plant I consume for slight pain relief) has all but obliterated my libido. All of this piled up can make a man feel, well, inadequate to say the least. 

My wife wants to jump right to ivf, and I really hate the idea of its invasiveness (she does too) but I'm 32 she's 29 and we're just tired of the whole process at this point. I really don't want to go thru the process of ivf because no part of it is going to be even remotely exciting. She's apparently high risk because of a backwards uterus. High risk because PCOS. And high risk because of the ivf in general. Couple all that with the process in and of itself and its just going to suck, totally. 

I made her a promise though and that is that I/we will do whatever it takes for her to carry our child and give birth. I have to stick to my word. I've explained that I do not have to like any part of ivf but that doesn't mean I won't go thru it with her. 

I've made the mistake of bringing up weight loss as a potentially huge help to possibly bringing back natural cycles, reducing the hair growth, etc, and when she is of a clear mind she gets slightly motivated to try, but after some effort nothing happens and she ends up getting angry and kinda throwing the idea of weight loss in my face as if I think she's fat. I totally understand that having that kind of conversation is walking on a bed of nails, so the backfiring is expected. 

So since weight loss is basically not an option, iui just seems like an expensive sex without the pleasure, and we are against birth control (morals, and it messed with her libido too), it looks like after $10k in failed attempts with super ov that we are stuck with ivf. 

I'm supposed to be support for her when she's down but all I have left at this point is a dwindling faith that we will ever get what we want and she has said she can't handle much more failure (self harm is NOT a worry). 

I don't know why I wrote all this out. I guess maybe because I have nobody irl to vent like this  without fear of being treated differently because of what I said. Maybe in hopes that someone with the same situation with this stubborn case of PCOS has some suggestions. Or maybe to tell over 10k strangers that I, as a man, can't get my wife preg. Who knows.

I read an article once about all the time we waste waiting in lines. The article proposed a solution of “last come first served” to reduce wait times. For example, if five people were waiting to drink from a water fountain and another person walked over, the person who walked over would drink first followed by the second to last person to arrive. The logic was many people would have no wait at all and the first arrival probably wouldn’t waste much time because they would quickly realize the situation was hopeless and leave without being served. Obviously, this method violates most people’s innate concept of fairness. This week I have had two acquaintances who started trying more than a year after I did announce that they were pregnant.

My wife and I have been declared inexplicably infertile since we've been trying for the past four years. My stuff (sperm) checks out great but it's clear the hangup lies within her fortress somewhere.

Over the last two years we went through ten (yes 10) IUI's with no success, to the point where the doctor and nurses at the clinic we were using were skeptical of our attitude and questioned why we continued to return. Why not? We're youngish, (28f 27m), we want it, why would we not continue to hope?

However, after 10...one has a tendency to lose hope. We are both strong and very much have ""it'll happen when it happens"" attitudes, but after 10 it was pretty obvious this was not going to work for us.

So we began researching IVF. The word began isn't quite appropriate as we both admitted to each other that after the 3rd or 4th failed IUI we started looking into it separately, but whatevs. We settled on a clinic in the biggest city in Iowa (!) and began a course of action.

Through awesome insurance and wonderful people of medicine our confidence was restored and my wife began birth control in early November.

Everything was great. Time went on as it does and every 8am ultrasound showed progress. Hope. A potential future baby growing in one of those little specs. We had our retrevial this past Tuesday the 11th. They got 7 eggs (her right ovary didn't want to play along, could explain this whole mess). But we had 7. For the first time in 4 years something quantifiable to give us reason to be positive. The next day we found out 3 had fertilized. 42ish%. Considering the small sample not bad. We were excited. The Dr. (bless him) was excited.

 We were ready to make the 2 hour drive Monday morning (yesterday, now) to arrive at the clinic at 1pm. to put one of them damn things back in there. Phone rang at 830 yesterday morning. None of the eggs made it. Damn.

I can't begin to express the feelings and questions I have. My wonderful wife is willing to go through hormone hell again to get us through this (after a one month break) but she's visibly hurt. I've tried to, and without tooting my own horn, realistically been the strong one through this. Plenty of admiration and respect through what she has put her body and mind through, plenty of ""our time will come"" (i know, i know). But this...for whatever reason this has hurt more than any other unsuccessful attempt. I've got a warrior of a woman but I worry for her, we both want this so much. Can someone tell me it will be okay?

Edit: Thank you to everyone for sharing your stories and encouragement with me. I will be sharing this post with my wife later this evening :) DNA fragmentation testing is on the schedule for our off-month in January, thank you to those of you who recommended it and for helping remind me I need to continue to do everything I can from my end to see this succeed, ",t2_8gbkq,False,,0,False,IVF round 1 failed.,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_a7922a,False,dark,0.94,,public,30,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,30,,False,self,1545173664.0,,[],{},,True,,1545148341.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Sorry to rant.

After 6 months I just knew something was wrong, everyone told me not to worry but I went to a doctor anyway. Husband had semen analysis and his results were  good. She ran a full hormone panel on me which showed what I suspected, PCOS. As well as this my prolactin was very high, had MRI and no tumor so I never did find out why it was high. I was put on Metformin and bromocriptine to level out my hormones. I had a HSG and everything was normal.

We kept trying with no success and eventually were put on a 6 month course of clomid 50mg to be taken on days 2-6 along with the Metformin 850mg twice daily. I am now on my 6th month of this and hoping and praying that this will be our month, as it is our last. Of the 5 months I've been on the clomid, I ovulated 4. So I'm just left wondering why. Why isn't it working, everything is physically fine now apparently. There have been months where I've been a few days late and felt pregnant but never got that positive test. I worry that we're falling at the last hurdle and maybe it's failure to implant?

Aside from all of the physical stress caused by the medications - headaches, nausea, constant fatigue, hot flushes etc. I've also found the whole ordeal very mentally and emotionally exhausting. I've suffered from anxiety and depression on and off my whole life and add the clomid mood swings, the stress of infertility and the guilt that goes along with it and it's actually too much to bear at times. I'm also a survivor of childhood sexual abuse which means that the invasive nature of all of the medical exams has been quite traumatic. 

Despite all of this stress I have a full time job and am somehow performing well at work and doing what I have to do day to day. Our marriage is stronger than ever and I have a very supportive family. But even with this great support system and the fact that I am a strong person, this year has almost destroyed me. So long story short my doctor says the next step is IVF. I really didn't think we'd get to this point. On top of all of this since we've started this journey my brother has had two children and many of our friends have started families without even planning. It just seems so unfair and I feel like I'm becoming bitter and isolating myself from everyone.

I was triggered when my lining reached 8mm  with pretty low estrogen levels (around 400) and follicle size of 18mm. I ovulate regularly and my lining can easily reach 11mm. I find it odd that they asked me to trigger so early. But maybe its a common practice? what are the most common/best? approaches</p>

<p>Could you tell me about your fet?</p>

<p>What was the indication for triggering in your fet?  lining thickness, follicle size, natural lh surge? </p>

<p>When did you start  taking progesterone?</p>

<p>Did you take estrace after trigger? </p>

<p>How many days after trigger did you have a transfer ?</p>

In September, it appeared I was 'unexplained' infertility. OBGYN prescribed Crinone/progesterone to see if that would help us achieve a pregnancy. I used it this past month but my period has still not come back despite having stopped Crinone 7 days ago. I have had 3 negative pregnancy tests so pretty sure pregnancy is not the cause. Temps are still high (>98.3 degrees).

Adding to my concern, I'm not sure if I started using it before I actually ovulated and that could be messing up my body. 

* I went for an HSG in 3rd week of November, which showed a follicle at 12mm. RE expected I would ovulate 4-5 days later.
* 5 days later I had a lot of EWCM and a bad headache, then no CM the next day. So, I started using Crinone 7 days later, which should have been after ovulation. 
* BUT, my temps had not increased by that point, so I'm worried I took it too early. I also never managed to get a strong positive OPK, just an 'almost' then fading, but that could have been poor testing on my part.

Since then, we've been diagnosed with pretty bad MFI, so we're hoping to move to IVF in January. But for that, I need AF to come and for my cycle to be back to normal. **Is there a risk I could have screwed something up with the progesterone?**

Long story short, I’ve now read several articles about new research that indicates opioid use has a significant impact on fertility as it suppresses the hypothalmic-pituitary-gonadal axis. 

Here’s why I’m upset: I abused opiates for several years. 

I was not your stereotypical junkie, I was an overly anxious and significantly neglected child that grew up into an easy target for a lot of trauma. And I numbed a lot of things by zoning out on pain killers that I was prescribed legally to treat an actual chronic condition. It was a dark time and I actually look back on it and feel like it wasn’t real.

My life is completely different now. I’m much older, wiser, and healthier than I have ever been. I have a very normal life. I’m a mild mannered, well meaning, nice person. You’d never know I battled the things I did. I thought I had escaped.  

But here I am, 10 years later and almost 6 years sober, barren. I’m beside myself.

I have DOR (AMH 0.44, FSH 9.1, AFC 12), and our RE expects 4-10 eggs max, meaning that we'll likely have very few (if any) blastocysts.  We're trying to decide about PGS (out of pocket), and I'm wondering if anyone has experience with doing the embryo biopsy, but then freezing & batching the biopsies for possible future PGS testing.  Is this a thing, or is it kind of required to send the biopsy immediately for testing (without freezing) in order to get accurate results?

My thought is that if we only get 1-2 blastocysts per cycle, maybe we could do a combo of fresh transfers and batched biopsies, for potential later testing, without running the risk of multiple thaw/freeze cycles on the embryos themselves.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So quick background:

\- June 17: letrozole IUI = Nope

\- July 17: letrozole cancelled IUI = pregnant = ectopic, removed one tube

\- Nov 17: IVF 1: 11 fertilized eggs, good at day 3, all poor by day 5, all arrested by day 6 (we transferred one fresh and nope)

\- Mar 17: IVF 2: 6 fertilized eggs, 4 good and 2 meh on day 3.

\- July 17: Transferred 2, nope. 2 more made it to blast and frozen (grade 2 fair)

\- Sept/Oct: hysteroscopy showed chronic inflammation but lap results came back negative. After consulting with other drs, we treated for it anyways with lots of antibiotics during the next cycle, when we also did an ERA and my results came back receptive.

\- Now: prepping for another transfer in January. We have 2 embryos frozen, both grade 2 fair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now we need to decide how many to transfer. We are all basically on the edge. My dr said she is 52% leaning towards 2, but would do 1 considering my history of ectopic. But since I'm in the category of having enough failures, I don't have as good of a prognosis of someone just starting IVF. My husband and I have been solidly on team 1 embryo because we're too scared to lose both at once.

Took DHEA for 2 1/2 months prior 2nd ER per RE, CoQ10 for both cycles. 8 eggs, 4 mature, 1 fertilized, no blast. ICSI. 

I only have one ovary due to a large (10cm) endometrioma and left ovary removed a year ago. Had some bad endo throughout pelvic area and some was excised by my OB/GYN. Didn’t know about Nancy’s Nook or specialists at that time. Long road of recovery over 2018 with much pelvic pain - doing acupuncture and pelvic floor therapy which has helped. Had a rough recovery after 1st ER with pelvic pain coming back and just not feeling great for some time. Just did 2nd ER a month ago. 

Husband also had a vasectomy reversal 3 years ago and we have been trying since then with some months of it going better than others (his performance issues, relationship issues, my pelvic pain issues). We also have had plenty of stress over the years due to blending families with his 3 kids and their biomom taking him to court often. The blended family while dealing with infertility is an especially hard challenge emotionally at times. We just started couples counseling as well as individual therapy to help in this time of difficulties. 

Had my RE follow up and his thoughts were a possible similar cycle but adding another day of stims to aid in egg maturity and doubling up the HGC Trigger to 20,000. We have paid these 2 cycles completely out of pocket due to denial from insurance due to vasectomy. RE also gave me the donor egg spiel and favored that choice for better results. It would help with my pain issues and up the odds of conceiving but I had been hoping for 3 tries for my own genetic child.  Without anything banked I feel a bit against the numbers now though. I may be more open to considering donor eggs but it feels like I don’t have enough information on what went wrong and I am going a bit mad trying to determine my next path. We have new insurance that has some low coverage but we don’t know what our costs would be yet. We would likely need a loan for whatever options we choose and I worry that I will end up needing to go the donor route but then not be able to pay for it.

<p>Any helpful thoughts on choosing next steps?  </p>

This is the 3rd AMA I have done. If you are not familiar with me I run an Instagram acct explaining all things IVF (IVF\_Explained).

I am an Embryologist that has been working in the field for a while and have traveled the world working in many clinics. As such the acct on Instagram started as a hobby but has grown to be a bit more about opening the curtain of what goes on behind IVF and answering some Qs about what I see and why we do things.

As a reminder, I cannot give Medical Advice. This is not the easiest subject to tiptoe around and I try to keep the convo as general as I can. If you ask things like should I change my meds or what protocol do you suggest, I cannot really go into that on here with such limited info, and I do not want to confuse you from your treating Clinicians professional advice. I can, however, help you work out what to talk to your Dr about and what answers you should be expecting to hear back

280,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband suggested we might change REs before our next round of ER in January (we are planning to do two retrievals in a row, 1 in Jan, 1 in March, and will decide when to transfer from there if we're lucky enough to get to decide). I was kind of lukewarm about the suggestion, but I couldn't tell if that's because i'm experiencing some form stockholm syndrome/a major case of inertia or if we'd really be better off with someone else. 

Some background: very low AMH, pre-expressed fragile X (\~0% chance of having a child with Fragile X syndrome), BRCA+ (recommended oophorectomy @ \~35yrs); got tested about six months after trying thanks to a conservative OBGYN who said after 30 and six months, go get tested--very thankful for the time she saved us. she's the one who recommended this RE and clinic; 

RE is kind of a dude bro, let's call him ""don."" A bit derpy. Very well-intentioned, but it always feels like something is slightly off, like he's not 100% there. One visit he's very chatty and helpful, the next barely says hello and is out in five seconds. A nice example of the derp might be during our first consult, he looks at my chart and the first thing he says is, ""oh, interesting""--kind of unprofessional, right? during our second consult he seemed like he'd just eaten a giant lunch and maybe had a glass of wine. 

&#x200B;

TW: loss

&#x200B;

Treatment so far: 3 failed IUIs, 1 IVF round resulting in CP (4 mature eggs, 3 fertilized > 3 blasts = 1 nonviable, 1 turner's, 1 viable-transferred-resulted in CP) 

&#x200B;

Cons against don: 

* it doesn't feel like he's approaching our case like it's a unique case, doesn't feel particularly proactive. i'm getting the ""kitchen sink"" treatment lol
* appointments are short, we always feel like we have more questions after we leave his office than answers, we always feel pretty rushed or pressured to get our questions out in time before he leaves
* consults are pretty uninformative. i have a looming oophorectomy (recommended for age 35, I was 33.9 at first consult). we had just learned about our infertility and hadn't really thought very hard about the various ways we could go about this. at no point did he suggest banking embryos and then doing transfers later--which is what we ultimately realized mid-IVF was what we were looking for--why didn't he suggest this? or ask the questions that would have helped us articulate this/realize this for ourselves? 
* we asked to switch nurses because we were having communication problems with our nurse. i was so adamant about it i even asked him to do it right after our ER, like while i was still in the hospital bed, cus i realized then and there with these big decisions about to made I needed someone i trusted. he didn't do anything. i called the head of nursing and got my nurse changed. after the change he noted what a 'lucky coincidence' it was my nurse got changed cus he hadn't remembered to do anything... 
* we were supposed to be on coQ10 and DHEA but this never got communicated to us... this could have been him or the first nurse, who knows, but either way no one really took responsibility for the miscommunication, no apology, no nothing
* our first beta came back 72... i saw him in the office that day cus I was there to pay some bills. he congratulated me really enthusiastically, like a giant slap on the back, and said how happy he was. when i told him we were being cautiously optimistic until the second beta, he looked at me knowingly and said ""the number look good"" ... they were not good. 
* calls us to give us the news of our second beta, leaves a voice message, doesn't say everything is okay. he has NEVER called before, so I assume the worst. message is left right before lunch. lunch break is an hour and half. initiative 1.5 hrs of panic. apparently he only called because, per the nurse, ""it's his thing"" to try and call with one of the beta results.... results of second beta were technically normal, tho there wasn't doubling. there was no real reason at that moment to panic (tho ultimately there was) and i wasn't really able to shut off that panicked feeling for the rest of beta hell. 

Pros for don: 

* he does his best to make sure he (as opposed to another doc) always sees us at appointments, he offers to adjust his schedule to make things more convenient for us, including for scheduling surgery stuff
* he is a very good surgeon from what i can tell. polypectomy was pain free, ERs, FET, all of it has been good
* he does genuinely seem to care and want the best results for us. he called himself to deliver the news about the CP
* he seems up on the newest methods, but not too easily swayed by trends... he's pragmatic and sensible, which I really appreciate
* he got me pregnant! and on the first IVF try. we didn't know before this if we could get pregnant... if it's not broke, don't fix it, right?    

TLDR; RE gave us a pregnancy, albeit not a successful one, on our first round of IVF but he has some borderline bedside manner problems that make us think we can do better...

&#x200B;

Can we do better? Is it worth changing up doctors (but staying at the same clinic) when he's had success with us? I lean towards no, but husband more of a yes. Any insights would be appreciated.

Luckily we have some good sperm of his (&gt;90% motility and morphology) in a sperm bank. The sperm bank is in Florida, our RE is in NY. We obviously HAVE to ship the sperm but I am SO nervous about it. What if something goes wrong and we lose it? They can compensate us all the want but they can’t give us a biological child at that point. It’s obviously has to be done, I know that, but I’ve been putting off signing that paper because I am just too afraid to lose it. How often does that actually happen?

We talked about being more open with people while we were having our break but now we’ve started trying again I have massive anxiety about telling anyone.

To be honest I just don’t know where to start and don’t know what people’s reactions will be.
