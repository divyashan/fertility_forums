We push RE for further genetic testing and An ultrasound for blockages and are awaiting results. But basically feel completely written off by him. 

My husband called his dr last week to ask for a referral to a new fertility clinic for a second opinion or to a Urologist specializing in fertility. His drs solution? Send him for another SA at the hospital (not a specialist or fertility department). Wont refer.

So I call my dr today and explain the situation and ask for a referral to a bigger cities fertility clinic. His response? “well if there’s no sperm there’s no sperm- even if there was a blockage something should get out” when I started explaining about sperm extraction He said “well I don’t know if that’s really an option for Azoospermia“ and that “ I shouldn’t get my hopes up because a diagnosis of azoospermia is definitive” also will not refer.

Am I delusional? Isnt microtese or TESE a possible option?! At the point hes done 1SA- why is everyone writing us off as a lost cause? I just feel defeated.

But before that there is the Stims Roller Coaster. The idea of this FAQ post is to gather together information about how we can follow and perhaps even predict what is coming during the IVF stimming period of heavy monitoring prior to an egg retrieval. Everyone is different, but being able to understand a few basic principles can demystify the process. I'm going to kick things off with some more generic guidelines that I've picked up to help my math during an antagonist cycle, but because *guidelines like these are not everyone's reality,* I'm hoping folks will respond with more personalized experiences of their own stim math (and whatever context is necessary for folks to test whether their math might look like yours).

**You want to ask whoever is doing the ultrasound to tell you your follicle counts and measurements at every visit.** There will be some variation between clinics in terms of the threshold at which they measure and record sizes, so you also want to find out what your particular clinic is measuring and what they are not. If your clinic only formally measures above, say 10mm, you might suddenly have new follicles cropping up half-way through that you weren't previously aware of, though a lot of clinics will at least count the number below that threshold, even if they don't measure each one individually.

You'll likely have done some kind of suppression prior to this cycle (lupron, BCP, estrogen priming, etc). Once you've arrived at the stim cycle (FSH/LH), first you'll do a baseline around CD 2 of the retrieval cycle to count AFC and make sure that you don't have an estrogen-producing cyst or a serious lead follicle. (If you've been on BCP, it will be more like 4-5 days after stopping.) My clinic is happiest when nothing is above 3-ish mm, but I'm curious where other clinics fall. If you're cleared, you'll start stims that night. **You may have more follicles in play than appear at the baseline AFC**. Some people who are particularly responsive to stims may end up also recruiting follicles that would have ordinarily been growing for the next month or the one after that. **You may also have follicles counted at the baseline that don't grow.**

The next appointment is often around the 5th day of stims (after four nights) to see how the follicles are progressing. At this appointment they key thing they are looking for is the general principle of how you are responding to stims, and also **whether you seem to be developing an even-ish cohort**. From this point onward, they'll also be checking to see if you need to start an antagonist, either because your E2 is over a certain level, or because your lead follicle is getting close to mature. Note: E2 gives you very little indication regarding stims math.

In a US context, the pattern for subsequent monitoring is usually every 2-3 days while things are still progressing, and then daily once you get close to triggering. In general, the earliest anyone will trigger is stim day 8, and there are many folks on this sub who stim for double that time or longer. To follow the stims roller coaster at this stage, you need to remember that **follicles tend to grow at a rate of 1-3mm/day, most often 1-2mm/day when they are smaller and 2-3mm/day when they are larger**. This means that your cohort may spread out more as stims continue. For example, if you have an 8 and a 13 one day, the next day the 8 might measure 9-10 (and then 10-12 the day after that) while the 13 might measure 15-16 (and then 17-19). Once you start an antagonist, your cohort is even more likely to spread out.

In general, **follicles in the 14-16mm range have a 50% chance of being mature, and follicles over 16mm are presumed to be mature**. Unless your RE makes a call to sacrifice the lead follicle, you will be racing the clock to see how many smaller follicles you can get into mature range, before the largest forces you to trigger. **Most clinics will trigger when the lead follicle is between 18 and 23,** which is determined by a variety of factors. For example, there is a tendency to trigger on the smaller end for older women in order to get better quality. That decision will also depend on some of the medium sized follicles; for example, if your lead follicle is 19mm, but you have several follicles in the 12-13mm range, your RE might wait one more day, in order to give those 12-13s a 50/50 chance. Your E2 level may also come into play at this point, so a concern about OHSS would often cause a clinic to trigger sooner, even if it means leaving those 12-13s behind. Some of this last minute fiddling can also be finessed with the specific trigger used.

Clearly, **the stims roller coaster is all a fucking waiting game and you have no idea what is actually in the follicles until you retrieve.** But a bit of stims math may keep you more sane. For example, you can also begin to guess by your third monitoring appointment around when you might trigger, which means you can make plans; if you have no follicles above 15mm, then you have at least 2-3 more days to go, so the earliest you need to take off work for retrieval is 4 days later, and likely longer.

*29 and have been trying for just over a year*

My first ever Reddit post! I’m feeling really overwhelmed by PCOS! Have just deleted my Facebook and Insta because I’m so sad seeing pregnancy/baby posts when we aren’t having any luck. Glad I recently found Reddit and seeing all these posts makes me realise I’m not alone, so thank you for sharing your stories! 

Praying there is light at the end of the tunnel for PCOS. Currently awaiting our first appointment for fertility treatment (given up waiting for NHS treatment so we are going private and I’m praying I won’t need full IVF). I’ve tried Metformin and myo inositol, losing 150lbs in weight, focusing on my diet and exercising daily. Although I am having regular periods now (between 30-35 days per cycle) and other PCOS symptoms seem to have lessened slightly, still no baby :( I have no idea whether I’m ovulating or not. Fed up of tracking my cycle and feeling so disheartened and disappointed. 

Just feeling sad today and wondering what I’ll do if I can’t have children, worrying about the costs of all the treatment we might have to pay for, worrying about explaining to my mother in law why her son isn’t a dad, worrying about the time I’m going to need off work for treatment and explaining it to my employers. Husband has no issues - the issue is me so I carry a lot of guilt on my shoulders for that. Ugh. I hate PCOS infertility so much.

Sorry for the miserable post! I know I’m still at the start of the journey but I just feel so defeated already. Any advice for someone that is all new to this would be much appreciated! 

Thank you so much!

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

28,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Firstly, thank you to all of you on this reddit. It has been immensely comforting for last few months.  To introduce myself,  I am 33F and husband is 34M. We started trying 3 years ago. After a year of naturally trying I visited a OBY/GN in Feb 2019. I am in India and OvBY/GN is the first option.  We did the whole set of tests. My AMH was 0.81 but other than that all our values were good. We did one IUI, it failed. She then got an HSG done and my right tube was partly blocked.  We then changed doctors. The new doctor recommended a laparoscopy to help figure out if there were any problems. The only thing she found was a polyp blocking my right fallopian tube. No endo, no blockage, perfect uterus.

We then did 3 IUIs between Dec 2019 to Mar 2020. All failed.  Not even a CP. By then Covid happened so April we took a break. In May she referred me to an RE and we started our IVF journey:

IIVF #1: AFC 20, eggs retrieved 4, 2 fertilized, on day 3 we had only 1 embryo and the RE recommended we transferred it.  It failed,  beta was 5

The RE then recommended embryo pooling 
IVF #2: Again AFC 20+, eggs retrieved 4, 3 fertilized,  2 day 3 embryos frozen. Both are excellent grade

IVF #3: AFC 16, eggs retrieved 4, 4 fertilized,  3 day 3 embryos frozen. 2 are excellent grade and 1 is good grade

We did round 2 & 3 back to back. For each retrieval my doctor tried different protocols to see if my response improved. Last cycle we had 14 big follicles on the day of the trigger.  My E2 was 3500. But most of those follicles were empty :(

We are now taking a two month break and plan to do a FET in December.  I have 5 day 3 embryos and am confused on how to proceed. Should we thaw them and see how many make it to blasts? What if none survive? Should I keep transferring day 3 till they stick? Or we transfer 1 day 3 in December and if that doesn't stick try top grow the remaining to day 5 and take it from there? Any other thoughts? 

We have fertility coverage and financially can do more retrievals but I am not sure if that will even help if I keep making only 4 eggs.

It has been immensely comforting for last few months.  To introduce myself,  I am 33F and husband is 34M. We started trying 3 years ago. After a year of naturally trying I visited a OBY/GN in Feb 2019. I am in India and OvBY/GN is the first option.  We did the whole set of tests. My AMH was 0.81 but other than that all our values were good. We did one IUI, it failed. She then got an HSG done and my right tube was partly blocked.  We then changed doctors. The new doctor recommended a laparoscopy to help figure out if there were any problems. The only thing she found was a polyp blocking my right fallopian tube. No endo, no blockage, perfect uterus.</p>

<p>We then did 3 IUIs between Dec 2019 to Mar 2020. All failed.  Not even a CP. By then Covid happened so April we took a break. In May she referred me to an RE and we started our IVF journey:</p>

<p>IIVF #1: AFC 20, eggs retrieved 4, 2 fertilized, on day 3 we had only 1 embryo and the RE recommended we transferred it.  It failed,  beta was 5</p>

First, I’m not very Reddit savvy so apologies if I do something wrong!
I’m 41 F, my husband is 45 (yesterday!) M and we’re starting our 2nd round of IVF. We started late (married in 2016) so age is our biggest factor. I have very irregular cycles, I’ve been told I “might” have PCOS, and my husband has MFI (at this point, I’m wondering if anyone who knows me can see this post? Or is the group private in some way?). 

We started with about 6 months of not trying/not preventing while I was considering and eventually having hip surgery. Once I was recovered, we started actively trying for another 6-8 months before going in for a work up. We did 3 rounds of IUI before the doctor recommended moving on to IVF. I responded well to the stim meds and got 24 eggs which, post hunger games, left us with 1 embryo. 

We’re starting our second stim cycle with my next cycle. I’m going on the patch on Monday for suppression. My current headache is calling around to all the fertility pharmacies and pricing meds. (Which is a whole rant that I’m sure many of you have expressed so I’ll leave that off!) 

I’m working from home due to Covid, which is great in a lot of ways, but... the closest clinic that our insurance program will let us use is an hour away. For our last round it was no big deal because it’s also 15 min from my office. I was able to go in for all the appointments on my way to work, but this round am wondering how I’ll manage 2.5 hours (or more) out of my workday to accommodate the travel and appointments. So there’s that stress.

59,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I am posting our ssr story in a few groups where I think it may help others with male factor fertility issues.

It took a while for me to gather all the information to be able to make treatment decisions, so I thought it may be worth sharing our story.

My husband had zero sperm in his SAs, normal hormone tests, normal karyotype, no y deletions, no cf mutations. 

Scrotal ultrasound suggested cyst could be blocking sperm exit, urologist couldn’t feel one of the vas (tube) and was unsure about the other one. 

So in the end we were diagnosed with obstructive azoospermia (OA) due to the absence of vas deferens (CAVD).

Based on our tests’ results, the urologist was 95% confident that my husband has sperm and it can be extracted with ssr to be used for IVF/ICSI.

We live in the UK, but NHS don’t fund fertility treatments in our postcode, so we started investigating private treatment options in the UK and Europe. 

I spoke to 7 fertility clinics (UK, Czech, Greece), each of them had their own idea on how to go about about our situation. 

1) One of them recommended initially to try seropeptase vitamins together with doxycycline antibiotic to see if the blockage could be removed naturally during a course of a few months.
We thought this didn’t make much sense, considering that my husband was diagnosed with missing at least one of his vas (tube). No vitamins will help to grow a tube back. 
Also, we didn’t want to wait so long for something that felt like a really long shot.

2) A few clinics said they would time my egg collection with ssr - more specifically needle aspiration of the sperm (i.e TESA/PESA). This meant both of us would go under anaesthetic at the same time which felt stressful. Also, we didn’t like the potential of finding out there is no sperm at a last minute like this.

3) One clinic said we should prepare donor sperm backup in case they can’t aspire sperm on the day of my egg collection via TESA/PESA (I would never proceed to a donor sperm without trying more advanced sperm retrieval methods than a needle aspiration).

4) One clinic highlighted that sperm aspired via TESA/PESA is more likely to be lower quality, they may not be able to aspire enough for freezing, and my husband may have to repeat it for each cycle or proceed to microTESE later anyway. 

Their recommendation was to do microTESE right away, try and collect enough sperm for a few cycles, and freeze everything before I start stims. 

This way, if it went well - my husband likely would not need to repeat the ssr in his lifetime. 
Also, if they didn’t find any sperm - I would have an option to not do stims and ivf at all.

We proceeded with option 4 as that sounded as the most conclusive procedure. We didn’t want further stress with trying things that may or may not work.

I was nervous about my husband having to go through anaesthesia and testicle surgery, but in the end it was not as bad. 

They only made an incision in one of his testicles and collected enough good quality sperm for a few cycles. The procedure took less than an hour and my hubby was awake soon after. They discharged him from the hospital after a few hours, asked to bed rest for a day and take it easy for 2-3 weeks.

My husband had a knee ligament surgery earlier this year and in his opinion microTESE didn’t feel as ‘a real surgery’ in comparison to the knee one. There is some pain, but it is managed well with paracetamol.

We did our microTESE in Greece. It was a bit daunting, but in the end we are happy we came here.  It worked out cheaper and the clinic is just fab.

This post is about helping folks to get the bigger picture about utilizing donor eggs. *There will be a resources post for donor eggs and questions to ask donors posted at a later date.*

Some points you may want write about include (but are not limited to):

• Why did you decide to pursue using donor eggs?

• Did you use frozen or fresh eggs? What was the process? (Timeline, testing, legal requirements, pros and cons, etc)

• If you used a known donor, what was the process? (Timeline, testing, counselling, legalities, etc) How did you approach the donor?

• What factors affected your decision for selecting an egg donor?

• The emotions and feelings surrounding using donor gametes can be intense and complex. What advice would you give to others facing the same decision?

And of course, anything else you’d like to share.

ER 1 yielded 4 'fair' embryos. Not PGS tested

Fresh transfer 1 (2 embryos): Failed

FET 1 (2 embryos): CP

ER 2 yielded another 4 fair embryos. Not PGS tested.

For the first transfer, it was fresh, so who knows why that one didn't work. For the second transfer, I did progesterone for 4 days, transferred on the 5th day. PIO injections were around 8 pm, so at the time of transfer, I had \~87 hours of progesterone exposure. I heard from many folks that 120 hours was standard, so I brought it up to my clinic prior to transfer, and I was told 'we have been doing this for a long time.'

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now: We want to do a third transfer (2nd FET). I asked that we add a day to make it closer to the standard 120 hours. My doc refuses to do it without an ERA. I have found at least 3 different studies that give a range of receptivity at 120 hours anywhere from 72.5%- 82.3%. Meaning if we just added a day to be like the rest of the dang country, we very well could be receptive. Of course we aren't receptive at \~90 hours. 

&#x200B;

I have $10,000 in lifetime coverage for infertility. This ERA will take $1000 of my coverage, and cost $700 out of pocket. We only have 4 embryos, so there's always a chance we will have to go on to a third retrieval, but theres also a chance we won't. Part of me wants to read her these studies and insist that they just try a transfer with the right protocol, but the other part of me wonders...maybe my window actually IS off, and I will need 7 days of progesterone. I mean, I 1000000% am expecting the ERA to say not receptive using their crappy protocol. 

&#x200B;

What would you do? I hate to not do it and 'waste' embryos if my WOI is really off. On the other hand, if it's not (and it likely isn't, because in the studies I have read, most aren't), I hate to waste $1000 of my lifetime limit on it, when thats money gone from another retrieval.",t2_12v09h6n,False,,0,False,"Talk me into an ERA, or talk me into pushing back for an appropriate protocol.

Will I be nice and supportive to them? Of course. But I will still be struggling inside. It’s not that I wouldn’t be happy for them.

Will I be nice and supportive to them? Of course. But I will still be struggling inside. It’s not that I wouldn’t be happy for them. But I’m just so sad and upset about my infertility journey that the idea of dealing with this stuff at all the family gatherings makes my stomach turn. </p>

<p>Anyway, I try to always stay strong, keep a stiff upper lip. I try to not complain about this stuff because I can’t change it by doing so. But I just want to scream and cry and go into a cave and never come out again right now.</p>

Hey gang! I posted a while back about my wife, herself working through and processing the endometriosis life, and [a study she's conducting](https://www.infertilitystudy2020.com). Our last post drew in a good amount of engagement, and so I wanted to repost one time in case there were any additional users that were interested in participating. I'm organizing the post into sections, because I'm sleepy and it's easier to think/write/read in sections.

&#x200B;

= = =

# The Gist

Doctoral Candidate Amazing Wife is doing a dissertation study on infertility. Specifically, how infertility affects individuals in the relationship, and the relationship as a whole, through the lens of instruments like emotions and relationship satisfaction.

&#x200B;

= = =

# The Goal

There's a big gap in mental health counseling regarding the  ongoing, daily trauma that is the struggle with infertility. She's hoping this study can help inform techniques, workshops, and new areas  of study to benefit individuals and couples in the mental health and counseling worlds.

&#x200B;

= = =

# The Ask

She's looking for a large sum of **individuals and their partners** to participate (really focused on couple participants), and **it's just a survey**. It's a short process (15-20 minutes), and for every survey completed, $1 is donated to your choice of ASRM, Fertility for Colored Girls, or Resolve.

# The Anything Else

More than happy to answer any questions at all. Biggest question I've got so far is ""why isn't she posting this herself?"" She's just not a Redditor. This is an exercise of sitting on the couch together, pointing at the screen, typing, clapping hands in glee, etc.

This was completely shocking to us and our doctor. Leading up to the retrieval, all my labs looked great, my follicles seemed to be responding and growing like they should. The Thursday before the retrieval my follicles were as follows: Left 22, 21.5, 17.5, 15.5, 13.6; Right 17.4, 16.2, 11.7, 10.1. We stimmed again that night (Thursday), triggered the next day (Friday) and egg retrieval Sunday.  Since my labs looked great and up to that point follicles were responding just as they should, it's shocking to us that none grew over the next few days and were mature at retrieval. 

My doctor's theory is that there's something wrong with my hormone receptors and my body didn't respond as it should to the trigger shot.  But not considering the trigger, I would think the last night of stims would have grown some of them enough to be mature.  According to my doctor this is very rare and he only sees this maybe once a year.  We have a meeting with him to talk in more detail on options (or if there are any), but I'm wondering if anyone had a similar experience (ie thought you should have mature follicles at last ultrasound and ended up with none) and what did you find was the issue and how did you address it?

So my doctor said that clomid basically increases all the necessary hormones for fertility and ovulation. He stated that I’d need to have my FSH, LH and so on checked beforehand to see if it’s necessary to even take clomid.

My question, let’s say all levels come back normal, and that I’m ovulating, can I still take the clomid? Are there risks to taking it for someone who’s fertility is “normal” but isn’t getting pregnant? I would just take it Day 5 of my cycle correct?

New here. I read the wiki and the rules and so so many posts, and I STILL have questions (and I'm very intimidated and scared to say something harmful inadvertently, so apologies in advance if I do). 

A little about me: I'm 32 and started seeking treatment with my OB earlier this year due to some long 50+ day cycles. She sent me off for blood work, and then when she got the results back, promptly shipped me off to the RE with a referral for ""suspected POI"". My husband and I have gone through all the initial testing with the RE, and here is the gist: 

AMH: 0.05 in June, 0.09 in August (Vitamin D was 16, started taking 5000 IU in June)

CD4 stats - FSH: 83, LH: 58, E2: 40, AFC: 2-3.

Sperm is fine. Genetic testing, he is a silent carrier for something I am not which is not a worry. However, he is a carrier for something called Shox Deficiency Disorder (we have a child with this) that he would pass on to any female child he were to have, but no male children. This disorder is relatively harmless, but results in short stature, shortened limbs, and may eventually have impacts on joint strength. We are not concerned about this being passed on, and previously accepted the fact that we could only guarantee not passing it on by going through IVF and selecting a male. With guidance from our genetic counselor, we felt comfortable that it was not necessary to go to that length to avoid the chance of having a female.

Today we had our follow up appointment with the RE to go over all this and talk options. The doctor said that it would not be ethical to try any medication to influence ovulation or IUI because of the disorder that would be passed to females if gender was left to chance (I disagree with this), and that it would also likely be in vain due to my FSH levels (I don't know enough to disagree with this). She also said that trying IVF with my own eggs was out because of my AMH and AFC. She said that unless I were to spontaneously ovulate (according to her, its very unlikely), our only option is donor eggs. We talked a bit about that, if I have anyone I would be able to use or if I would use anonymous eggs, and ultimately left it at ""take some time to process this, see if anything happens without intervention, and we can reach back out to you in a few months."". She said my uterus is in good condition and since I would need to use donor eggs, it doesn't make a difference whether we start right away or in a year (or more).

So now here I am, having read a bunch of stories on here with people who sort of fit into a similar category as myself, who were able to try IVF with their own eggs. I've read that there are different styles of treatment that can be used to help people like me. But my doctor didn't mention any of that. She just went straight to donor eggs. She didn't explicitly say I have POI or DOR. As I understand it, since I do still have a cycle, I probably fall more into the DOR category than POI. As far as I know, I haven't been ovulating (OPKs don't work because my LH is messed up), but I bought an Ovusense in August and am on my second cycle with that trying to confirm it, or catch it if it does happen. It just feels like we went from 0-100, without even a passing consideration for anything other than egg donation, but maybe I'm way off base.",t2_g5svb,False,,0,False,"DOR/POI - Should I be pushing to use my own eggs, or just go the donor route?",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_j1rub5,False,dark,1.0,,public,25,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Treatment Advice,False,25,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1601380294.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>TW: Mention of a child</p>

Over the last 1.5 years as a DOR patient I have had approximately a million questions about Lupron as part of stim protocols, but here’s the Lupron question of the month...this time about my next transfer protocol. Quick summary of the situation:

My last transfer protocol was a success though it ended in loss at 7 weeks. Had solid implantation with good betas. Leading up to the transfer protocol I was on 10 weeks of microdose Lupron (10 units / day). The reason for this was a) I have some cysts in my myometrium we were trying to  shrink (didn’t work) and b) backlog due to COVID so just hanging out on Lupron until I had the greenlight to start estrogen. For the cyst experiment we were originally aiming for 4-8 weeks on Lurpon to see if there was an impact and ended up doing 10 bc of the backlog. Cysts had no response but weren’t anywhere near the lining so we went ahead with transfer. Doc does not think the pattern looks like adenomyosis but isn’t sure (also isn’t adeno usually estrogen responsive)? Thinks if anything it’s “early” adeno and mild. Worth noting I’ve never had any endo symtpoms but who knows.

So anyway, given that the transfer technically worked, what would you do next time? The options as I see it are:

— Take a cycle off and do Receptiva but, again, we know the Lupron may have been part of the successful transfer so even if Receptiva was negative would we want to just do it anyway?
— Do the Lupron but a shorter amount of it. How much? 4 or 8 weeks? I’m sure there’s of course zero data to help make an informed decision about the ideal length.
— Do the same exact protocol because it worked — don’t mess with a good thing. Also if it is adeno, maybe Lupron is still a good idea even if the cysts didn’t seem to respond before?

I think RE is open to options, and said she’d do Lupron. Perhaps noteworthy also that I’m a weirdo and it’s not that hard on me compared to other drugs (headaches, but can take ibuprofen if just priming). 

My insurance covers microdose and I don’t want to do depot because my lining can be a little thin and I don’t want a lupron “hangover” once I start the estrogen. The main downside is of course time — 8-10 weeks of it would push my next transfer into the new year at this point. But of course if it works, what’s an extra few weeks.

Only other data point I have is a first total failed transfer with no Lupron (but we later found out I had endometritis and my prolactin was likely elevated, both were fixed for try #2).

Please stick to answers based on facts and your own experiences, and keep in mind that your contribution will likely help people who know nothing else about you (so it might be read with a lack of context). This post is about helping folks to understand social infertility and some of the unique paths to parenthood that fall under this umbrella term. Social infertility refers broadly to people who cannot conceive through intercourse due to “social” factors such as their relationship status (for example, not partnered), sexual orientation, or gender identity (for example, same-sex and queer couples of any gender or gender identity.) Please note that all individuals or couples encompassed by this broad definition may not personally identify with the term “social infertility.”

Mod note: Individuals and couples with social infertility are just as welcome on r/infertility as those with medical infertility. We will not tolerate harassment or pain Olympics against people with social infertility in this sub.

Some points you may want write about include (but are not limited to):

• What type of social infertility do you have? Do you identity with the term social infertility? 

• If you are using any assisted reproductive methods or pursuing foster/adoption, which are you using and how did you decide on this path to parenthood? 

• What have your experiences been pursuing parenthood (whether this is through treatment, foster/adoption or other methods)? Have you experienced any barriers to treatment or family-building as a result of your social infertility status? For example, negative experiences with clinics/doctors/foster or adoption agencies? 

• Do you also have medical infertility in addition to social infertility and, if so, did you know about your potential challenges TTC before you started the process? Or did you learn about them after starting to try? 

• The emotions and feelings surrounding social infertility (including but not limited to stigma/bias, use of donor gametes and/or gestational carrier, etc.) What advice would you give to others with social infertility about navigating the process?

I am just honestly really confused about what’s happening - I have endo, so granted in the past I’m use to horrific periods. Pain, clotting...

I had a 9w loss in March (turners) which was followed by a d&c. I then had two full periods, which were lighter than normal but I assumed this was due to the d&c... I still had cramping just less bleeding. I then went into a transfer in June, which we lost at 6w4d from an SCH. The first period after that loss was pretty non existent which I expected from large amount of bleeding / tissue loss I had during the MC. I went immediately into a retrieval cycle which was less than prosperous, retrieval was 8/18. Now I’m two periods post loss and they’re still SUPER light, like not even enough to fill a regular tampon. I have light cramping but nothing like I’ve had in the past. I am on half a tab of bromocriptine to manage my prolactin levels, 150 levo, and I’m priming with omnitrope until my next cycle for another ER.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result.

<li><p>Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.</p></li>
<li><p>Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as <a href=""/r/infertilitybabies"">/r/infertilitybabies</a>. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.</p></li>
<li><p>Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.</p></li>

<p>Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Links to pictures of HPTs (use <a href=""/r/TFABlineporn"">/r/TFABlineporn</a>).</p></li>

I had my egg retrieval last Wednesday. This Tuesday I ended up in the ER with extreme vomiting, sweats, animal pain, bloating, etc. It was TERRIBLE! My bloating was like nothing I've ever felt before.

Ended up at the clinic the day after and they drained half a litre. I felt instantly better! They set a check up two days later (today).

I go in today and I have another half litre that needs to be drained. They put the needle in two or three different places (!!!) But the fluid wouldn't come out so they sent me home and I have to go back on Monday to see.

I've been drinking electrolytes (edit: Gatorade and Hydralyte-- I'm almost exclusively drinking this) eating lots of salty foods, and am on my last day of medroxy. They've also put me on a blood thinner injection. My ab muscles hurrrt so I'm using a heating pad, taking tylenol.

Eating is hard bc the fluid makes me feel full. Chugging water has the same effect.

I'm really uncomfortable. I'm really frustrated and disheartened. 

Do any of you have any tips or advice on how to get through this or help it along?? Like how much more electrolyte water should I really be drinking?!? I'm drinking 2-3L per day... 

Also, do you know if any of these things are ok or will help:

- taking a bath
- poop teas
- dieretics teas
- fat burners (they make you pee and have diarrhea but I'm not sure where that fluid is really coming from)

Because of my (33,M) past history of hernias, my doctor suggested I get a semen analysis done after 6 months of trying. The results were within normal limits and the doctor said to keep trying for awhile and get my wife checked out later.

&#x200B;

My wife (27) had her ultrasound and we just had the follow up appointment. Her eggs and hormones are perfectly fine, however from the ultrasound, it looks like her left fallopian tube may be blocked or have some ""adhesions"" that are causing a slowed rate. He does not think it is endometriosis because there are no symptoms of pain or irregular cycles. He suggested 3 options:

1.  Laparoscopic Adhesiolysis  - They will go in and try to remove these adhesions with 4 possible outcomes: Nothing was wrong to begin with, They are able to fix completely, they are able to fix partially, they cannot fix at all.
2. IVF 
3. Keep trying naturally - he did mention that because it looks like her tube has adhesions, she is at an increased risk for ectopic pregnancy.

None of the 3 options were pushed for us to do, but IVF is something we would be okay doing down the road but nothing too soon. We are in the process of researching Laparoscopic procedures, and a few of our friends who had gone through fertility issues suggested that we always seek a second opinion. From what we see, it seems like these different options are pretty common.  I think we will take our time and continue to try naturally, and possibly get a second opinion.

This post is about helping folks to get the bigger picture about utilizing donor sperm. Some points you may want write about include (but are not limited to):

• Why did you decide to pursue using donor sperm? Did you use a sperm bank, or known donor?

• If you used a sperm bank, how did you pick which bank to use? What was the process? (Timeline, testing, counselling etc) 

• if you used a known donor, what was the process? (Timeline, testing, counselling, legalities, etc) How did you approach the donor?

• What factors affected your decision for selecting a sperm donor?

• The emotions and feelings surrounding using donor gamates can be intense and complex. What advice would you give to others facing the same decision?

Side note - throughout this whole journey, and especially this summer when things just get really bad (failed transfer after failed transfer) this friend has BARELY checked in on me. I say barely with the benefit of the doubt, I actually can&#39;t remember one helpful thing she&#39;s said or done. I do believe it&#39;s really hard for people unfamiliar with infertility to really understand the grief and loneliness of it so I&#39;m not mad at her, but I guess just frustrated? UGH, what to do? How to handle? </p>

<p>Should I just run away to Italy and live off wine and cheese? Will all my problems be solved that way? ha</p>

Our official diagnosis is unexplained infertility, which is now looking like recurrent implantation failure because we've attempted frozen embryo transfer three times over the last year with PGS normal embryos:

FET #1: Implantation failure

FET #2: Did ERA for a cycle, protocol showed no change, resulted in implantation failure

For FET #3, I got a second opinion and moved to a different RE who tried pretty much everything - lovenox, intralipids, low dose prednisone, embryo glue. I tested mildly positive at my first beta at 5dp5dt (with a level of 5.6) only to find that my levels dropped to a 2 on my official test day.

Usually there's something to look forward to, i.e. a treatment that I haven't tried yet but this time I feel mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted. I have two more embryos left, both PGS tested (one normal, another inconclusive) and I can't believe I'm down to my last two embryos after all my top quality ones did not take. I've also had a repeat loss panel done after FET #2 failed and I tested positive for a single MTHFR mutation (A1298c) so nothing else to rule out there.

So, some questions:

1. What would you do if you were in my position? Is there something else that I haven't tried yet I can ask my doctor about?
2. I declined a PRP (platelet rich plasma) treatment during FET #3 because I was told that it would improve my lining. Since my lining was good (10mm) I did not see the point. Has anyone tried this?
3. I'm reading online about neupogen wash and dexamethasone treatment but not seeing any studies with good results. Has anyone tried this and has been successful?

211,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"This is an informational post about conducting a products of conception test at home following a miscarriage, in case anyone in the future is trying to do this and searching for posts (as I was a few weeks ago). I am sure plenty of others have done this but I didn’t find many posts about the mechanics of it.

I had a strong reluctance to do a D&C because of a fussy lining, and strong desire to test because my miscarriage was of a PGS normal embryo. But whatever your reasoning, I wanted to share my experience in case it is helpful. This was for the Natera / Anora test but I would expect the basic method would be fine for other POC tests. 

Note: My clinic kind of discouraged me from doing this, saying it is “messy” and “easy to contaminate,” and acting like testing at home is unusual, and was generally a hot mess about the process. They managed the miscarriage fine (a nurse called me both days, answered questions about the drug), but gave me basically no clear guidance about the sample collection and testing process specifically. In retrospect I am really irritated by this: we took basic steps and got a testable sample, and I think home collection is just not a standard process so they simply didn’t want to do it. Unacceptable! Obviously emotionally this is a difficult thing to do, but operationally, I found it possible and feel like they should better support patients who want to do it. Of course, how it goes will depend on how your body processes the drugs, and it may be harder for others than it was for me.

In any case, I will stick to the details of sample collection and testing, not my experience with Cytotec/Misoprostol, which I think is well covered on other posts. Obvious goriness and miscarriage trigger warnings abound.

Supplies:
—Large glass or metal mixing bowl (the biggest that will fit inside your toilet bowl)
—Gloves (we used some unopened gloves for washing dishes, because that is what we had on hand)
—Bottle of saline spray (saline solution in a spray bottle - this is probably not necessary but my husband thought to get it and it worked well)
—Ziplock bag, disinfected tupperware, and/or collection cup and 1-2 oz of saline solution (you can order a kit from Natera ahead of time that contains this or buy it separately)
—Insulated grocery bag
—Ice pack (or ziplock with ice wrapped in a thin towel)

If you are doing Anora, even if you are testing at home, your doctor will need to order the test otherwise your sample won’t be processed, so just make sure they do that.

The night before starting Cytotec/Misoprostol, we ran the bowl through the dishwasher by itself on the “disinfect” cycle and put it in the bathroom that we decided to reserve for this purpose (having 2 bathrooms is helpful, one to use normally and one to use for this). Also put the spray saline, regular saline, ziplock/tupperware, collection cup and the gloves in the bathroom.

Later the next day (Day 1), about 4pm after taking my first dose of Cytotec at 6am, I started feeling like I might pass something and went into the bathroom. We placed the bowl in the toilet in case at this time. My husband also poured all of the regular saline that came in the kit from Natera into the collection cup per the instructions (we had ordered the kit by emailing them and asking for it, and they over nighted it at no cost). However, as mentioned above, you can also just buy some saline and use your own container. In general, we found it helpful to have extra saline.

As I passed stuff, my husband was able to use the spray saline to help clean things off in the bowl and figure out what was potentially useful tissue and what was blood clots. If you order the Natera kit they will send an insert with pictures, but it’s basically just anything white, grayish, or light pink is useful and dark red is blood clots. You don’t want blood clots because they can contaminate the sample. 

If you are not sure about some of the tissue, spray it with saline or place it in extra saline if you have it and then put it in an “intermediate vessel” (e.g., ziplock or tupperware) for a few hours or overnight. Then reevaluate and decide if you want to add it to the final collection container that will go to the lab. We found that it was easier to see what was really there after it sat for awhile as the blood clots mostly dissolved. Likewise, if you are doing this alone and you need a minute (or many minutes) to recover before dealing with the sample, you do not need to be in a huge hurry to figure it out and put it into the fridge right away, waiting a bit may actually make it easier to see.

When ready, use the gloves to move the tissue to the collection cup and place it in the refrigerator. I had to take another dose the next day (Day 2) but did not get any tissue. We would have just added it to the collection cup if I had. 

Day 3: I went in to get an ultrasound to see if I had passed all the tissue, which I had. We brought the sample with us to the appointment in an insulated grocery bag with an ice pack.

After my ultrasound, my clinic sent me up to the surgery floor where they do D&C’s because they usually do the kits as part of D&C’s, and frankly, no one else seemed to have any idea what to do with it/me. Finally one of the surgery nurses came out with the main form for the kit for me to fill out (needed to then be signed by the doc on call which she later took care of), and she drew my blood to include in the kit. She then took the kit for me and shipped off to Natera. If I had required a D&C, I would have requested more tissue be collected during the D&C and everything sent to Natera. I think the fact that I had the sample with me helped demand that they figure this out *right away* vs sending me home and back into process confusion or making me take care of the shipping myself.

Note on alternatives: If your clinic won’t ship for you or is confused, there are instructions in the kit about how to ship yourself (for Natera, using Fedex and a specific box). And if your clinic is being especially unhelpful and getting the blood draw is complicated, there is an alternative cheek swab option enclosed and/or Natera told me that you can also send the blood separately. They also said is fine for the blood to sit up to two days in the refrigerator if you are doing this over a weekend or holiday, which I was. If you are using donor eggs, the kit says that paternal blood or cheek swab is fine.

Shipping: if you collect over the weekend, shipping should be by default on a Monday if using Fedex. I collected over Labor day weekend though — tissue collected on Saturday, clinic shipped on Tuesday, didn’t actually arrive to Natera until Thursday, and it was still fine.",t2_42oupl2w,False,,0,False,POC / Natera / Anora — Home Collection,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_ix7507,False,dark,0.94,,public,32,1,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},TW: Miscarriage/Loss,False,32,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1600744555.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This is an informational post about conducting a products of conception test at home following a miscarriage, in case anyone in the future is trying to do this and searching for posts (as I was a few weeks ago).

In retrospect I am really irritated by this: we took basic steps and got a testable sample, and I think home collection is just not a standard process so they simply didn’t want to do it. Unacceptable! Obviously emotionally this is a difficult thing to do, but operationally, I found it possible and feel like they should better support patients who want to do it. Of course, how it goes will depend on how your body processes the drugs, and it may be harder for others than it was for me.</p>

<p>In any case, I will stick to the details of sample collection and testing, not my experience with Cytotec/Misoprostol, which I think is well covered on other posts. Obvious goriness and miscarriage trigger warnings abound.</p>

<p>Supplies:
—Large glass or metal mixing bowl (the biggest that will fit inside your toilet bowl)
—Gloves (we used some unopened gloves for washing dishes, because that is what we had on hand)
—Bottle of saline spray (saline solution in a spray bottle - this is probably not necessary but my husband thought to get it and it worked well)
—Ziplock bag, disinfected tupperware, and/or collection cup and 1-2 oz of saline solution (you can order a kit from Natera ahead of time that contains this or buy it separately)
—Insulated grocery bag
—Ice pack (or ziplock with ice wrapped in a thin towel)</p>

<p>If you are doing Anora, even if you are testing at home, your doctor will need to order the test otherwise your sample won’t be processed, so just make sure they do that.</p>

<p>The night before starting Cytotec/Misoprostol, we ran the bowl through the dishwasher by itself on the “disinfect” cycle and put it in the bathroom that we decided to reserve for this purpose (having 2 bathrooms is helpful, one to use normally and one to use for this). Also put the spray saline, regular saline, ziplock/tupperware, collection cup and the gloves in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Later the next day (Day 1), about 4pm after taking my first dose of Cytotec at 6am, I started feeling like I might pass something and went into the bathroom. We placed the bowl in the toilet in case at this time. My husband also poured all of the regular saline that came in the kit from Natera into the collection cup per the instructions (we had ordered the kit by emailing them and asking for it, and they over nighted it at no cost). However, as mentioned above, you can also just buy some saline and use your own container. In general, we found it helpful to have extra saline.</p>

<p>As I passed stuff, my husband was able to use the spray saline to help clean things off in the bowl and figure out what was potentially useful tissue and what was blood clots. If you order the Natera kit they will send an insert with pictures, but it’s basically just anything white, grayish, or light pink is useful and dark red is blood clots. You don’t want blood clots because they can contaminate the sample. </p>

<p>If you are not sure about some of the tissue, spray it with saline or place it in extra saline if you have it and then put it in an “intermediate vessel” (e.g., ziplock or tupperware) for a few hours or overnight. Then reevaluate and decide if you want to add it to the final collection container that will go to the lab. We found that it was easier to see what was really there after it sat for awhile as the blood clots mostly dissolved. Likewise, if you are doing this alone and you need a minute (or many minutes) to recover before dealing with the sample, you do not need to be in a huge hurry to figure it out and put it into the fridge right away, waiting a bit may actually make it easier to see.</p>

<p>When ready, use the gloves to move the tissue to the collection cup and place it in the refrigerator. I had to take another dose the next day (Day 2) but did not get any tissue. We would have just added it to the collection cup if I had. </p>

<p>Day 3: I went in to get an ultrasound to see if I had passed all the tissue, which I had. We brought the sample with us to the appointment in an insulated grocery bag with an ice pack.</p>

<p>After my ultrasound, my clinic sent me up to the surgery floor where they do D&amp;C’s because they usually do the kits as part of D&amp;C’s, and frankly, no one else seemed to have any idea what to do with it/me. Finally one of the surgery nurses came out with the main form for the kit for me to fill out (needed to then be signed by the doc on call which she later took care of), and she drew my blood to include in the kit. She then took the kit for me and shipped off to Natera. If I had required a D&amp;C, I would have requested more tissue be collected during the D&amp;C and everything sent to Natera. I think the fact that I had the sample with me helped demand that they figure this out <em>right away</em> vs sending me home and back into process confusion or making me take care of the shipping myself.</p>

<p>Note on alternatives: If your clinic won’t ship for you or is confused, there are instructions in the kit about how to ship yourself (for Natera, using Fedex and a specific box). And if your clinic is being especially unhelpful and getting the blood draw is complicated, there is an alternative cheek swab option enclosed and/or Natera told me that you can also send the blood separately. They also said is fine for the blood to sit up to two days in the refrigerator if you are doing this over a weekend or holiday, which I was. If you are using donor eggs, the kit says that paternal blood or cheek swab is fine.</p>

<p>Shipping: if you collect over the weekend, shipping should be by default on a Monday if using Fedex. I collected over Labor day weekend though — tissue collected on Saturday, clinic shipped on Tuesday, didn’t actually arrive to Natera until Thursday, and it was still fine.</p>

My husband and I have been TTC (unsucessfully) for more than 2 years now. I have always had irregular cycles and I really struggled with anorexia as a young adult which lead me to having a very low body weight and as a result absent cycles for several years. I was diagnosed with lean PCOS in May. I was also referred to an NHS specialist to get further fertility support but my apt was cancelled as I managed to get pregnant in July using the Ovusense body thermometer to track my ovulation. I miscarried at 4 weeks and was put on Metformin by my GP. I managed to ovulate this cycle as well (on day 57) and got a very faint positive test at 15 dpo that never got any darker. I started bleeding heavily on the weekend.

Has any one experienced anything similar? I have only been on Metformin for a month and a bit, but should I have noticed any differences by now?

I booked myself into a private specialist so that I can at least start getting some answers to my questions. I'm just wondering what I can expect from it. Can I just come out and ask to try Letrozole or Clomid? I don't even truly know much about either of them.    
My GP is so limited in giving me any information at all as she reminds me she is not a specialist. 

Any support is so greatly appreciated. I'm feeling so low at the moment.

Have a question that you think might warrant a standalone post or doesn't fit in the treatment/chat threads?  Try the FAQ/Wiki first!  https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index  We have archived posts covering getting started, what all those acronyms mean, what we wish we knew ahead of time, individual experiences with ALL the medications, treatment options, common protocols, procedures, paying for treatment, past AMA archives, hunger games data... there's a lot of information there!

Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. Questions phrased like ""has anyone else tried clomid?!"" are not generally well received. There are over 20,000 subscribers here with the majority having gone through several different courses of treatment.  Use specific titles for your posts to make them more easily searched by users. ""IVF?"" is not super helpful. ""MFI and Endo, First round of IVF - Should we do ICSI?"" is more likely to get useful responses and easier for future members to find in search.

Examples of appropriate stand alone:

* A detailed intro post with medical history is totally appropriate as a standalone, particularly when it's paired with treatment/diagnoses related questions.

* Posting new research and including your thoughts on why it's relevant, what common beliefs it may challenge, or follow on questions related to the impact of the information.

* Asking for advice on a treatment plan with your relevant history and including what you are concerned about or why you feel a ""community opinion"" would be helpful.

Examples of posts that are not appropriate stand alone:

* An intro that says, ""hey new here, anyone doing IVF?""

* Posting just a link to research (particularly not from a primary source - like PopSugar, Medium, HuffPost, etc) with ""just saw this""

* Posting the doctor told me to take ""150 menopur, what do you think?

Try the FAQ/Wiki first!  <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index"">https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index</a>  We have archived posts covering getting started, what all those acronyms mean, what we wish we knew ahead of time, individual experiences with ALL the medications, treatment options, common protocols, procedures, paying for treatment, past AMA archives, hunger games data... there&#39;s a lot of information there!</p>

<p>Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history, and asking for advice on treatment plans, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. Questions phrased like &quot;has anyone else tried clomid?!&quot; are not generally well received. There are over 20,000 subscribers here with the majority having gone through several different courses of treatment.  Use specific titles for your posts to make them more easily searched by users. &quot;IVF?&quot; is not super helpful. &quot;MFI and Endo, First round of IVF - Should we do ICSI?&quot; is more likely to get useful responses and easier for future members to find in search.</p>

<p>Examples of appropriate stand alone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A detailed intro post with medical history is totally appropriate as a standalone, particularly when it&#39;s paired with treatment/diagnoses related questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting new research and including your thoughts on why it&#39;s relevant, what common beliefs it may challenge, or follow on questions related to the impact of the information.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking for advice on a treatment plan with your relevant history and including what you are concerned about or why you feel a &quot;community opinion&quot; would be helpful.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of posts that are not appropriate stand alone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An intro that says, &quot;hey new here, anyone doing IVF?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Posting just a link to research (particularly not from a primary source - like PopSugar, Medium, HuffPost, etc) with &quot;just saw this&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Posting the doctor told me to take &quot;150 menopur, what do you think? (especially with no information about diagnosis/history/flair).</p></li>

I’m so sick and tired of one-timers, newbies, drive-bys, people coming here and giving us, giving me shit. I’ve been struggling with this rant for some time. I’m gonna let it out. I’m making it a stand-alone. It’s happening. 

Hey if you’re new here, welcome, sincerely. Even just lurking on this sub means you’re in a shit place in life and something isn’t going right and I don’t wish this hell on anyone. 

Lemme just put it out there – harsh and straight. Infertility sucks. This sub, reflects that. This is not a place for empty hope and blind messages of baby dust. We are real. We suffer. We fail. 

We fail a lot. 

There are rules. Tons of them. They may sound crazy , but for many of us – THEY ARE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. Yep you can only post in certain places, only say certain things, only offer support in certain ways.

Yep, we REALLY HATE STANDALONES. It’s not personal. 

This is the ONLY place in the world that I have where I can say the deep ugly shit – and get understanding, not judgement. Jealous of breeders? Sidelined by unsolicited announcements during your paid-for workout program? Struggling to find joy for those you love who don’t struggle to get knocked up? Any of it and wayyyyyyy more. This is a safe place. Lay it out. 

This is the only place were the generic BS blind hope and messages of quick success are not tolerated. We can get that lip-service shit anywhere, anytime, and the further along I get, the less tolerance I have for it. But as human who tries to be kind, you stomach it, because it's the right thing to do.  Except here. Mo’fo’ no BS empty lies here. I get to be ANGRY. HOPELESS. SALTY. 

I promise you can learn the rules. If you find you don’t like them, rather than tell us, tell me, after my 5 years of failure, basically telling me in my damn home – how I’m an asshole, please consider yourself. There are other subs with no rules that will fit you perfectly – they were made for that very reason.

232,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So me and my wife have IVF coming up, and this is with a new clinic in Brisbane in Australia.

Thanks to the wonder that is testicular cancer, all we are getting from me is some seminal popsicles.

I have zero testicles, none, zip, Nada, zilch. Can produce exactly zero contribution to the process.

So when the paperwork arrived I didn't read it, I just read the date at the top, saved it in my calendar, and got in with life.

So the wife on Friday messages me ""You need to do those tests"" so I look at the email properly. HIV, Hepatitis, Syphilis, etc. All the STD checks.

That's weird, my last batch of all those STD checks were fine when I froze my samples before my last orchiectomy. Weird that they want that done. Nothing practically could have changed since I got that.

Me us me, R is Receptionist, N is nurse

So I ring the clinic:

Me: ""Hi this is Rumbuck, I have an IVF appointment booked for [date] with [Doctor] but they've asked for a heap of STD checks on me, which seems a bit redundant because you're using my frozen sperm because I can no longer produce""

R: ""Sir, were those tests done more than 6 months ago?""

Me: ""Yes""

R: ""Then sir, not to accuse you of anything, but we need more up to date tests than 6 months due to the possibility of someone acquiring those STD's""

Me: ""But why is that relevant?""

R: ""Because those STD's can be transmitted from the sample to your partner and the baby""

Me: ""How?""

R: ""Sir, I'll pass you through to the Nurse to explain""

Me: ""Sure""

*Cue 10 minutes of hold muzak*

N: ""Hello this is [Nurse] am I speaking with Rumbuck?""

Me: ""Yes""

N: ""You have some questions about the STD checks?""

Me: ""Yes, I am curious as to why I would need to do these, because I have no ability to produce naturally anymore due to cancer, so it will be a frozen cycle""

N: ""It's policy""

Me: ""Policy?""

N: ""Yes""

Me: ""But why would this be a policy""

N: *Explains how STD's can be transmitted from fluids*

Me: ""But, don't get me wrong I'm not a medical person, but if I didn't have these diseases 6 years ago when I saved my first samples, nor when I made a freezing at the start of 2020 when I had this the second time, even if I got these diseases in the interim, what's the issue? Can they magically jump from me via no physical or fluid contact back in time to infect my frozen samples?""

N: ""Ahh I see, well it's policy""

Me: ""Why? You are the people that everyone says to come to in our situation where the man can no longer produce, everyone says to come to you as the experts in the state, I just want to know why/how this is relevant, if it wasn't relevant months and years ago, those samples are a snapshot in time, nothing I do now can change them""

N: ""Look Sir, you can discuss this with the doctor at your first appointment, but it's policy because of the risks of transmission. However if you don't get those tests, then we may not be we to do IVF""

Me: ""Sure, bye""

--------------------------

Now I get that it might be policy, but I already get jabbed at least twice a month for blood tests, and my local path lab can only do a couple of tests per jab for some reason, I think it's due to how much blood they can take at a time. So these tests would require extra pokes with a needle into my already stuffed veins after hundreds of jabs over the last 6 years, I am sick and tired of being a human fucking pincushion here, especially if the tests are pointless.

Can someone explain to me why any of these tests on my side are relevant at all if they are doing a frozen cycle? They have no other option here.

<p>Thanks to the wonder that is testicular cancer, all we are getting from me is some seminal popsicles.</p>

<p>I have zero testicles, none, zip, Nada, zilch. Can produce exactly zero contribution to the process.</p>

<p>So when the paperwork arrived I didn&#39;t read it, I just read the date at the top, saved it in my calendar, and got in with life.</p>

<p>So the wife on Friday messages me &quot;You need to do those tests&quot; so I look at the email properly. HIV, Hepatitis, Syphilis, etc. All the STD checks.</p>

<p>That&#39;s weird, my last batch of all those STD checks were fine when I froze my samples before my last orchiectomy. Weird that they want that done. Nothing practically could have changed since I got that.</p>

<p>Me us me, R is Receptionist, N is nurse</p>

<p>So I ring the clinic:</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Hi this is Rumbuck, I have an IVF appointment booked for [date] with [Doctor] but they&#39;ve asked for a heap of STD checks on me, which seems a bit redundant because you&#39;re using my frozen sperm because I can no longer produce&quot;</p>

<p>R: &quot;Sir, were those tests done more than 6 months ago?&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Yes&quot;</p>

<p>R: &quot;Then sir, not to accuse you of anything, but we need more up to date tests than 6 months due to the possibility of someone acquiring those STD&#39;s&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;But why is that relevant?&quot;</p>

<p>R: &quot;Because those STD&#39;s can be transmitted from the sample to your partner and the baby&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>R: &quot;Sir, I&#39;ll pass you through to the Nurse to explain&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Sure&quot;</p>

<p><em>Cue 10 minutes of hold muzak</em></p>

<p>N: &quot;Hello this is [Nurse] am I speaking with Rumbuck?&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Yes&quot;</p>

<p>N: &quot;You have some questions about the STD checks?&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Yes, I am curious as to why I would need to do these, because I have no ability to produce naturally anymore due to cancer, so it will be a frozen cycle&quot;</p>

<p>N: &quot;It&#39;s policy&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Policy?&quot;</p>

<p>N: &quot;Yes&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;But why would this be a policy&quot;</p>

<p>N: <em>Explains how STD&#39;s can be transmitted from fluids</em></p>

<p>Me: &quot;But, don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not a medical person, but if I didn&#39;t have these diseases 6 years ago when I saved my first samples, nor when I made a freezing at the start of 2020 when I had this the second time, even if I got these diseases in the interim, what&#39;s the issue? Can they magically jump from me via no physical or fluid contact back in time to infect my frozen samples?&quot;</p>

<p>N: &quot;Ahh I see, well it&#39;s policy&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Why? You are the people that everyone says to come to in our situation where the man can no longer produce, everyone says to come to you as the experts in the state, I just want to know why/how this is relevant, if it wasn&#39;t relevant months and years ago, those samples are a snapshot in time, nothing I do now can change them&quot;</p>

<p>N: &quot;Look Sir, you can discuss this with the doctor at your first appointment, but it&#39;s policy because of the risks of transmission. However if you don&#39;t get those tests, then we may not be we to do IVF&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Sure, bye&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now I get that it might be policy, but I already get jabbed at least twice a month for blood tests, and my local path lab can only do a couple of tests per jab for some reason, I think it&#39;s due to how much blood they can take at a time. So these tests would require extra pokes with a needle into my already stuffed veins after hundreds of jabs over the last 6 years, I am sick and tired of being a human fucking pincushion here, especially if the tests are pointless.</p>

<p>Can someone explain to me why any of these tests on my side are relevant at all if they are doing a frozen cycle? They have no other option here.</p>

<p>I mean, I am 100% sure I don&#39;t have anything, so that&#39;s not a concern, but after all these years of cancer bullshittery, I&#39;m just sick and tired of being jabbed with needles. On more than one occasion I&#39;ve been tempted to say &quot;Fuck the monitoring, if it comes back and kills me then I&#39;ve had a good run&quot;</p>

TTC 6 years and started ART from April 2020.
 
April - Menopur + rFSH for 3 days then added Cetrotide on D4 of stim, but somehow I still ovulated earlier than expected and cycle called off.  Thought I almost got an ovarian torsion or something as it was a sudden acute pain over L lower abdomen and I had to curl up on bed the whole day and luckily it resolved after a weekend rest.

May - stopped for a month due to poor asthma control

June - RE put me on Suprecur (Burserelin) nasal spray. Thats sorta work as an agonist protocol, at first stimulating the pituitary to produce FSH/LH for few days then later spray will exhaust the receptors and stop body from making FSH/LH.  Then started stim injection. I used Menopur & rFSH. Ovaries were not too responsive and appeared dormant. AFC only 4-5 but all small according to the cycle day.  But progesterone become too high and uterus out of sync and too advanced in cycle, unlikely to have success in implantation.  IUI was cancelled and told to have sex on my own.  Obviously didnt achieve anything.

July - Similar protocol as of June ie Spray(increase frequency from twice per day to four times) + Menopur/rFSH injection, this time progesterone okay and proceeded to IUI but no success

August - Suprecur nasal spray 12 days & stim injection 10 days (Rekovelle + Luveris) and Saizen was added for the last 8 days of stim; Saizen 1 unit/day; yielded 13 eggs, 6 blasts

September - Suprecur nasal spray 12 days & stim injection 8 days (Rekovelle + Luveris + Saizen), clinic premixes everything together so I just have to do one shot per night. Again Saizen was given at 1 unit/day for 8 days;  yielded 9 eggs

Above are my experiences. I am glad my RE is open to change of protocol or drug choices. She is willing to switch and try out everything instead of asking one to retry similar protocol over and over.

I am not sure if I am biased but I think Saizen (HGH) does help. It doesnt seem to do harm so might as well include it. Another factor is the human derived Rekovelle and Luvaris. I am more responsive to these meds than my previous cycles with hampster derived Menopur and recombinant rFSH.

RE said the human derived stims used to cost more and somehow the companies have a discount for them for recent few months so she switched me to the regime. I think the injection of the human derived stims are less painful then Menopur and rFSH. 

I also take several supplements:

DHEA: 25mg once daily from CD1 then increase to twice daily on CD 8-9 and max out to three times for last few days till egg retrieval

Omega: twice a day of preparation in form of 500EPA/250DHA

Multiple Vit: the special vitamins formulated for ART, included CoQ10,  Inositol, Melatonin 

Tru Niagen: a special form of B3, NAD+, supposed to combat anti-ageing, some small studies in mice showed that it help with the reproductive system

Green Powder: just drink for antioxidant effect assuming that can help ovaries or eggs from oxidative stress

I am desparate and basically put everything in. I dont think those extra HGH or supplements will do any harm. I just hope to boost my ovaries for few months to get the eggs out to bank up. 

I am not so diligent to read up about the details of IVF. I just rely on what my RE decision and listen to her on what to do. Now with first hand experience, hope the info will be useful to some of you. Some REs tend to be convervative and a bit old school. Allowing 3-4 months for RE to work out what the problems lie.  If things dont work out after 3-4 months of IUI or IVF egg retrieval, I think its worthwhile to have more drastic change in terms of medication choice or protocol.  Try raise different ideas with RE. Finally, I know its tiring going in for scans, bloodwork, stims etc. Wanna take rest in between cycle. My RE said the stim meds seem to have additive effect to wake up the ovaries.

- PCOS; no other diagnosed issues (no know uterine, lining, or sperm issues)

- 2 IUI = 2 miscarriages and a late term pregnancy loss (28 weeks 5 days)

- 3 IVF cycles = 3 failed implantations with euploid embryos, 1 miscarriage with a “no DNA” embryo, 1 miscarriage with euploid embryo that had a heartbeat, doc says I will likely miscarry again (another euploid that apparently split but isn’t growing)

- tested for immune issues: low leukocyte antibodies (had 3 LIT treatment); elevated cytokine ratios (had immunosuppressant therapy)

- tested for blood clotting (negative) and thyroid issues (negative) 

- did an ERA test and adjusted protocol 

- This last cycle I use estrogen, progesterone in oil (butt shots), endometrium, low dose aspirin, and lovenox (injection - blood thinner)

So to preference I have spoken to a gyn. About a year ago about my fertility concern and she told me to take prenatals and after trying for a year come back to her. I also have a problem appointment this month on the 28th. 
Okay so quick run down of my history so there’s no questions and so I can get the best answer out of this: I had nexplanon implanted in 2015 and taken out early in 2018 I was on Nuva ring until May of 2019 knowing that it would be about 6 months until it completely wore off for lack of a better word. Me and my husband have been trying since that August to get pregnant. My periods have been normal since 2020 January. I had an ovarian cyst rupture this past June. Haven’t had another one since and no issues until now. We both began taking fertility supplements the first of this month and I was tracking my ovulation. I had an LH surge the 28-31st of August. I was due for my period the 10th of this month and still have not gotten it. I took an ovulation test everyday since the 10th (thinking maybe I miss read the tests earlier the past week and was maybe ovulating late) and got high positives everyday until two days ago (so 8 days high positives) and negative pregnancy tests. (Tested every 5 days) 
So, my question is does anyone have any good insight on what maybe going on, and or what questions I should ask my doctor on my upcoming visit.

The mid-sized ones didnt seem to progress in last scan and RE suggested to trigger anyways for the 20mm eggs. Not sure if the smaller ones can become mature.

I had this bad feeling when I stepped out from recovery room and didnt see my husband. Nurse said he was still in the room trying to produce the sperms. He has on and off ED and I already knew he wouldnt be able to make it. Another hour went by and nurse suggested us to return home and try to get a sample and return to the clinic by 2pm. That was like 2.5 hours away from the deadline. I wanna rush home and give him more space and privacy to try. But he didnt seem to worry about it and insisted we had lunch first. By the time we got home, it was already 1pm. 

His member just remained placid. He looked at the clock like every 5 minutes. I tried to stay nice saying its okay and dont worry. But deep down I was so angry at my destiny and at him. I bought him supplements but he always forgets to take them. I have to put them in pillbox and he still complains there are too many capsules to swallow. He is overweight and seldom exercises. I have a full time job working long hours trying to keep up with mortgage and all the IVF expenses. He has not worked for several years and I dont even demand tangible contribution.

270,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So last night was my first time trying to inject stims and let's just say.. it didn't go that well.I am doing them alone but feel like I need a third hand to assist with the actual injection or something, so wondering if there are any tricks or tips from the people that do these on themselves?

My problem seems to be that when the needle is in and held with one hand and the other hand is pinching the skinfold, I can't figure out how to properly reach and press the plunger on the pen or syringe while holding the needle still in me.

This is what happened:I am doing 225iu of Gonal F Redi-Ject and 150iu Menopur.  (Eventually also Cetrotide and Novarel).

Watched many youtube videos and read reddit forums the days leading up, and spent probably a good 30mins prepping things, totally amateur style and not without trouble, but this post is about the actual injection.

I inserted Gonal F Rediject pen slooowly; when it was all the way in I struggled to reach the back of the pen with my thumb but finally clicked it, counted to five and then pulled out.  Suddenly there's lots of blood everywhere - like actually running down my tummy and even spilling on the floor!   It didn't hurt but I definitely wasn't expecting that and I could feel myself getting dizzy, like the stupid chickenshit that I am.   Started googling and quickly found out that was not a common thing and that I'd had to check with a nurse in the morning, but at least it was done. One down one to go!  Then I looked at the pen to make sure it said '0'.  Guess what?  It still said 225!  I had injected absolutely nothing..

Looking at the pen a little closer I realized there is another 'level' of movable area in addition to that tip edge click and that this area increases the higher the dose is.  So I hadn't pressed hard enough.. or I guess, like, at all!  My first site of injection had already formed a big bruise (today it's dark blue and about the size of a pencil eraser).

Disheartened I changed the needle tip to a fresh one and started googling a bunch of new youtube videos - then found an Australian version that mentioned that the closer to a 90 degree angle you insert the needle the less bruising you will have.  I had done mine closer to 45 degrees on the first try -to me that 90 degree straight stab just always looked so dramatic and painful!- but decided less bruising would be a good idea now that I already had two belly buttons...This time the needle wouldn't even go in.  Like it just h u r t.  I thought at first my muscles were too tense but then realizing I wasn't even trying to inject into a muscle so that didn't make sense.  At this point I considered just giving up altogether.  I ended up sitting down, with legs out in front of me.  I'd been standing because the girl in every video was standing.

So I sit down and now it finally works.  Needle goes in, straight 90 degree angle, it doesn't hurt and it doesn't bleed.  But I am really struggling to reach that back button with my thumb and press it all the way down, especially without wiggling the pen around while in me.  I want to do things slowly and don't want to push the pen/needle further into my stomach by applying too much pressure on the back of the pen, if that makes sense?  I manage somehow, but it takes much longer than it probably should.  At least there's no more bleeding and the exit goes ok.  Pen read 0!

With Menopur this problem gets worse, because  I want to go especially slow to avoid the burn I've been reading about.  Everyone says slow and steady is key.  But when I finally have the needle inserted fully there is no way to be steady while trying to push down the presser-thing on the syringe!  Since I'm holding the syringe with that same hand, I only have the thumb free to press but it's not easily 'pressable' with one finger and I don't want to push down hard and suddenly get momentum so that everything goes in at once.  I try and push lightly and it literally doesn't move.  I consider letting go of the skinfold pinch with my left hand so it can help hold the syringe in order to control the movement more steadily, but don't know exactly what the skinfold's purpose it so don't.

At one point, just sitting there with the needle in my stomach and a syringe full but too chickenshit to push down on I just looked around me and was like 'well now what guys?'  It was ridiculous.  I finally managed to get it all in - somehow - but definitely wiggled both the needle and syringe around and probably had it in me for close to a minute.  The only good thing though; it didn't burn, at least not until the very very end and it was very minor, and there was no bleeding on the exit.  And left no bruise, so I only have that one big one from the first failed attempt.

But now I'm sitting here, hours away from the next round of injections and thinking there has to be some better way of doing this... Why can I not find anybody else talking about this missing-extra-hand problem?  Am I just an idiot?  Are my hands too small?  Does nobody else have problems pressing the plunger when holding with pen/syringe with the same hand?  Am I just too chickenshit for this stuff? (Probably..)

Any tips help!!!

And thanks for reading all that... I'm doing this all alone (to salvage some eggs) and nobody in my life knows and so I don't have any shoulders to cry, or laugh, on.

273,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi All. I've been a part of this group for a few years now and appreciate all the support and knowledge that exists here. I would like to ask for some advice for my next steps in treatment, as I am not sure what to do. 

**My history:** 

I'm 34f and my husband is 37m. We are both healthy and active with no chronic conditions, besides my depression and anxiety and low (but not clinically low) thyroid for which I take Synthroid daily. 

We started trying when I turned 30 in 2016. After an unsuccessful year, we got some testing done and learned my husband had very low motility. He went on Clomid and supplements which helped some but we still didn't have success.

In 2018 we did 3 medicated IUIs. The 2nd IUI was a positive but ended up being ectopic that was resolved with one round of methotrexate. After the second IUI I had a polypectomy but no success afterward. After looking through all my paperwork I discovered that my AMH was .9 (from a test in early 2018). When I asked my fertility nurse practitioner about this she said that my AFC was always good so she wasn't worried about it. I had it re-tested in Dec. 2018 and it was .6. I also have the MTFHR gene, however the type that is less consequential (I forget the name exactly). 

Early 2019 we had two IVF consultations. One MD said his biggest concern was my AMH level and diagnosed me with DOR, but before going into treatment we decided to take a break and travel. This was an amazing mental//emotional break. It was like we were remembering how to have fun again. I had another polypectomy in Dec. 2019 to prepare for IVF in 2020. 

**January 2020 -- Egg Retrieval:** 

My protocol included 300IU Gonal F, 150IU Menopur, LDN, and .25g Cetrotide. For several months leading up to retrieval I was taking Theralogix Prenatals, DHEA 75mg/daily, Vitamin D, Fish Oil, baby aspirin and Inositol. I ended up with 5 eggs, three mature, two fertilized and made it to blast on day 6. Both were PGS normal however their grades were 3bc and 3cc.

We were planning to do FET in March but due to Covid that changed. We ended up transferring the 3bc in late July, however it failed. My protocol for the FET included LDN, Estrace, Z-pak, prednisone, baby aspirin, prograf, lovenox, progesterone suppositories and PIO. At the time of transfer my lining was tri-laminar and 9.96mm, estrogen 105, progesterone 19.9.

I had a phone call with an NP to review what happened. Basically there was no indication as to why the transfer failed and we discussed next steps. Here are my options: what do you think? 

**Option One:** 

\-SIS to determine if I have more polyps preventing implantation. If so, move onto polypectomy. 

\-ERA to determine best transfer time. 

\-FET with last remaining embryo (3cc)

**Option Two:** 

\-SIS to determine if I have more polyps preventing implantation. If so, move onto polypectomy. 

\-Egg retrieval with lower dose protocol. The NP recommended 200IU Gonal F, 10mg Letrozole, HcG, and lupron trigger. She also recommended adding the Female Endocrine Pack supplements to the others I took for the first round. 

\- Fresh transfer. I've read that while frozen transfers may result in higher live births, patients who are low responders to stims have better results with fresh transfers. ([https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180821112013.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180821112013.htm))

*OR*

\-ERA then FET

**Additional details:** 

* We live in Alaska where there are NO IVF clinics, only NPs that do IUIs. We use CNY Fertility and have been using their Albany clinic, but now that they merged and have a location in Colorado Springs, we plan to get treatment there. I can do the SIS, polypectomy, ERA and all monitoring in Alaska, but all ER and FET require extensive travel.
* My husband is mentally and emotionally done with this process. He wants to give up. I don't. It's fun. 
* My embryos are PGS normal, but poorly graded. If I do an ER and I get more embryos I'm considering putting in more than one.

**TL;DR:** My first IVF FET failed, I have one more poorly graded PGS normal embryo. Do I go through an ERA and potentially a third polypectomy for this one embryo OR do ER and possible fresh transfer? Help.",t2_kuxk0h4,False,,0,False,Looking for advice for next steps after FET fail.

297,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi All. I've been lurking for awhile and thought I should do an intro.

My husband and I have been TTC for 2.5 years. After 1 year of trying we both had full workups and everything was ok except AMH was on lower end (1.1), ovarian volume was highish, and there was one cyst visible on ultrasound. Over the next few months I discovered I was insulin resistant and shortly thereafter completely stopped having unmedicated periods. Basically I have a classic case of PCOS and likely ovulate very rarely. My husband and I had a hard time deciding how to proceed, he struggled to come to terms with the fact that it won't ""just happen"". 

I've done two medicated TI cycles (letrozole 5.0 + ovidrel trigger) with monitoring about a year ago. We were planning to try IUI and I was figuring out when to take the provera when I got my first spontaneous period in 2 years. (I think it may have been related to me working very hard on my blood glucose control but that's speculation at this point.) The IUI was this past Wednesday and the whole process was a bit of a whirlwind because I didn't expect my period. This time they upped the letrozole to 7.5.

Now I'm twiddling my thumbs and trying not to overthink every weird body thing. All of the sudden I'm paying very close attention to how gassy I am.

While I'm here I need to gush for a minute - this sub has been a safe haven for me. The emotional part of infertility has been so hard and my jealousy and sadness have been overwhelming. Hanging out here has made me feel so much less alone and made dealing with infertility, well not easier really, but definitely more peaceful. And I love the rules! I know the mods catch hell for them sometimes but oh my goodness, having a space where no one is talking about kids has been a breath of fresh air.
