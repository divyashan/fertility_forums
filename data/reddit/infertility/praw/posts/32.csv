It looks like DOR from my low AMH (0.71), and my AFC of 8 (as this morning), as every other data point seems normal-ish.

Hey, ya'll. If you've been watching the daily threads, you know shit just got real in my life, and to top it off I am 99% confident this cycle is a fail. 

The next few months are going to be too crazy for me to keep strict cycling and doctors appointments.  But we don't want a zero chance every month, because I'm getting old.  However, because of Mr. Feetos' nerve damage and back injury, P-in-V sex to completion is really not possible. 

I heard about at home inseminators (I wish I had heard about them 4 years ago). I thought that would maybe give us *something* to do over the next 3 to 4 months. But it's hard to find reviews of the different products.  Habe you ever tried them?  If so, what were your favorites? 

Yeah, I know that if 6 IUI's with Clomid, tracking, and trigger, and 1 IUI with injectibles didn't work, the likelihood that an at home inseminator would work is next to nothing. But it's better than the non-existent alternative.

Whenever I have a test that doesn't require it to be run in-house by my clinic, I opt to go to the LabCorp that's just 5 min from my house.  Unlike my clinic, they don't charge me $20 (not billable to insurance) just to poke my skin, and also this particular LabCorp seems to not bother to collect on bills if they're under a few bucks.  Since my insurance is pretty good when it comes to bloodwork and the cost to me is usually somewhere between $0.50 and $3, that means I have literally never gotten a bill from them.  

Anyway, this guy has been the main phlebotomist there since I started going there, originally after my first miscarriage just over two years ago.  He's always super nice and we shoot the shit and I really like him.

I also noticed that he had a tattoo on his arm of baby footprints and with the saying ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.""  I always assumed it was from a stillborn so deep inside I felt like I had some camaraderie.

Well even though he never has pried before (I assume due to patient privacy), it's clear that the clinic ordering my blood draws says ""reproductive medicine"" right in the title, and it's always HCG and progesterone.  Last week, he lightly asked if they were just tracking my levels, and I responded ""yeah, tracking them down after another miscarriage.""  He nodded and didn't ask anything more, which I respected.

This week, I was much more chatty with him in general (finally getting snow today hopefully!) and when we got back in the room, he asked how I was doing.  He then specified, how are you doing physically, and how are you doing mentally?  Then he opened up about so much - he and his wife going through many miscarriages, her losing a baby at 8 months, and how he and his wife started trying again and just yesterday she miscarried at 6 weeks.  He said he was doing ok, but he was worried about her.  He also said they have two daughters so he knows they're lucky.  And also they seem to get pregnant in general so at least he doesn't have to go through IVF.

Anyway, it was just so nice to just open up and have that compassion that only comes from someone else who knows, who gets it.  At the end I could tell he wanted to hug me but that would be weird so he shook my hand.  And then he said if I ever want to drop by and chat or just hang out, I'm always welcome, and they go on lunch around 12:30.  I don't know if I will, I don't know if that would be weird, but it was such a nice offer.  Maybe I'll bring him coffee next week at what will hopefully be my final blood draw from this miscarriage, because it'll be a few months before I see him again.

We´re seen at the university hospital and the way it works is that first, the attendings observe your cycle and then you´re seen by the chief to discuss the findings and options. 


The first doctor who found out about my useless ovaries told me that they could maybe regulate my cycle with hormones (get the lining to grow, trigger ovulation at the right moment) but the chances of me getting pregnant where extremly low. 

They still continued to monitor my cycle and behold: several follicles where growing by CD12. Two went on to become beautifully mature follicles and the lining was just perfect. Once the follicles were >20mm I asked if we should maybe trigger ovulation (as it was already CD20 and my lining was more than ready) The doctor that saw me that day informed me that triggering in my situation would never work, as the fact that I don´t ovulate spontaneously meant that there was either no egg or a useless egg or a LUF syndrome and triggering wouldn´t work. She said my only chance was natural IVF (as stims wouldn´t do anything for me because of my high FSH), but she woulnd´recommend doing that as my chances were close to zero. 

So here I am with two follicles going bad and no ovulation. The final evaluation with the chief of the RE clinic will be this saturday and I´m afraid he will also tell us that there´s nothing we could do.

25,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello all, been lurking for a couple months. You all seem great, and I'm feeling increasingly terrible, so rather than hold my breath and magically hope this all works out I thought it was better to just...dive on in. I dunno, I've written a novel below. 

I'm in a very happy same-sex marriage! Wife is older, has irregular cycles, not interested in pregnancy. I'm younger, run like clockwork, and have always wanted to get pregnant. All my numbers are great – AMH, FSH, thyroid, I ovulate on my own with nice thick lining and the radiologist who did my (near painless) HSG called my tubes ""beautiful."" (Yay?)

I also have an anxiety disorder that responds REALLY poorly to progesterone. Hormonal birth control in college contributed to a massive extended anxiety episode. My wife and I both think that this makes IVF a potentially VERY bad idea for me.

So with the best of intentions we started out with a natural IUI. Within 4-5 days I felt super wacko - I was barfing, starving, exhausted, stuff smelled/tasted weird, my wee boobs got enormous and sore. Excelsior, right? And then on day 10 after the IUI, I started spotting (not at all a part of my normal cycle), and my symptoms slowly decreased, and then I got my period bang on day 14, as I was taking my first HPT. I felt certain I had experienced a chemical pregnancy. I was devastated. (Innocent babe that I was.)

So we added in progesterone, in case that was the culprit. And we did four more cycles. The progesterone seemed to stop the spotting, but I still experienced one or two more instances where it felt like my body was producing a buttload more progesterone than usual on top of the supplementation, then bailing on me around day 10-12.

By round 5 I had an absolutely shattering anxiety episode that basically obliterated my ability to function for two months. 

We took six months off. I went back to therapy, found a psychiatric prescriber with experience in prenatal care, switched to a new, more hands-on (pricier) RE; switched donors; added in ultrasound monitoring. 

Cycle #6, back to a natural IUI, but this time with ultrasound monitoring. I felt fresh and confident. And I had repeat of that first natural cycle. Hormones went nutso, day 10 spotting, day 12 negative beta. So this wasn't an isolated incident followed by a rash of super bad luck, it was A Thing.

Over the last four cycles we've added in Femara (to see if having more than one corpus luteum in there helps), then when the spotting kept recurring, we put progesterone back in too. 

And IUI #10 just flunked out. I started my period (EARLY, DESPITE PROGESTEROOOONE) as I was waiting for the phonecall with Day 12 beta results. We get one more cycle on this protocol and then we have to Speak With The Doctor about our Options.

We have no diagnosis. Everything looks sparkling. Something in my body just won't let us get off the ground. Asymptomatic endometriosis hiding somewhere? All my eggs have some identical defect that makes them wipe out exactly during implantation? Some shitty luteal phase disorder that REs don't currently find fashionable to believe in? 

We have no fucking clue. And because we're gay, so many of the statistics feel hopelessly skewed against us. We haven't had a year of unprotected sex before this. We're using frozen donor sperm. Our insurance only covers blood tests.

So I'm feeling really lost, and very hopeless. Ten IUIs is a lot of emotional punishment. We would be so happy to adopt, but I will deeply grieve the loss of the potential experience of pregnancy and the genetic continuance of my wonderful family of origin. We're taking at least a month off again, to slow down a little, de-stress from the election, see family, be humans. 

I don't know if I'm looking for ideas, or just for empathy. Anything helps, really.

EDIT: I didn't mean to post and run - I had to work all day and wanted to sit down and read each response on something other than my phone. Thank you all for your kind words and thoughtful responses - this helps reduce my anxiety immensely. 

My takeaway from your replies has been: It doesn't always work the first time, be prepared for multiple tries. Don't put too much stock in the numbers, it only takes one. The shots are a breeze after you get over the first few, the crazy hormones are expected but the waiting is worse than expected.

<p>My takeaway from your replies has been: It doesn&#39;t always work the first time, be prepared for multiple tries. Don&#39;t put too much stock in the numbers, it only takes one. The shots are a breeze after you get over the first few, the crazy hormones are expected but the waiting is worse than expected.

Well 2016 has been absolute shit. I've had two m/c and now get to travel even further down that rabbit hole where the tone starts to change from, ""oh, we can help you!"" to, ""well, here's what we can try."" I've also had to essentially give up my horseback riding hobby because the treatment schedule and frequent restrictions conflict terribly with it, plus we want to conserve funds. And the fucking cherry on top was finding out that my younger sister was pregnant. We can throw politics in there too for the sprinkles, why the fuck not at this point.

We're now going into the holidays and Mr. Beard actually deals with all of this less well than I do. He came up with the idea of noping on outta here for Christmas and going on vacation somewhere, likely Europe because go big or go home and we found really cheap airfare.

Now to my knowledge he hasn't actually told his mother that we are using ART because she is super catholic and at one point early on she mentioned something negative about ivf and that was enough for him to decide to keep it private. I've urged him to tell her but otherwise I'm not stepping in that. Anyway, he floated the idea of leaving town past her and she was actually 110% on board and was like, we'll just celebrate when you get back and I think that makes total sense with all you've been through (she knows about the MC's) and now with her sister.

So now it's my turn and I was dreading that call and rightfully so. My mom is SUPER family orientated, like family comes first in all things and you should self sacrifice for that purpose. That call didn't go so well. She basically told me to see a therapist and that I'm hurting my sister (who hasn't said anything to indicate as such and I've gone out of my way to privately congratulate her). There were a few bingo's in there related to stress and ""it'll happen when it's meant to"". I told her that she's basically asking me to be in pain to make her happy and even if I was in any kind of therapy that it wasn't going to automatically make things better for me where I'd be comfortable in that situation within a month anyway.

You'd think a women who had 2 losses of her own and struggled between pregnancies would be more understanding......

Now I don't know how to feel, or how to deal with this and I'm an emotional mess and I'm full of guilt.

39,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"TL;DR: OHSS so bad the excess fluid had to be drained.

I figured I would share my experience with the group in case anyone else ends up dealing with severe OHSS they might know what to expect.

Yesterday I posted in the daily about considering contacting my RE's office after having severe abdominal pain 6 days post ER. I shot off an email to my IVF Coordinator and decided to try and shower to see if it helped at all. Flash to 10 min later and I am curled up in a soaking wet ball, dry heaving uncontrollably while my husband is brushing his teeth helplessly asking if there is anything he can do to help.

Needless to say, I immediately called my office after the heaving stopped and they got me an appointment 2 hours later. I made my husband stay home so he could drive me to the appointment because at this point I wasn't even able to dress myself, let alone drive anywhere. I left the house in slippers, 3/4 length workout pants from Costco, and a T-shirt.  No bra and no make up. Then I threw on my longest coat to try and hide, which I realize now looks a little like a house coat when worn with slippers. I've never felt sexier, let me tell you.

The 30 min drive was excruciating for me. Every bump in the road caused unbearable pain to my ovaries and abdomen that nearly caused me to puke. Once we were called back to be seen, I was weighed and my ""abdominal girth"" was measured (at 8"" larger than normal). Again, never felt sexier.

I talked to the RN for a long time about my symptoms. Basically until it looked like I might pass out and she forced me to lay down.  Which was ok, because it was time for a good old fashion twat wanting. She was in there for a long time to measure my ovaries, fluid amount and blood flow to my ovaries, which she said was good.  When she finished, she asked me to stay lying down and went to consult with another RN.

She then came back with an US tech that was going to do an abdominal US.  That tech scanned my abdomen from underwear line to bra line and all the way she could reach around before hitting the table.  When she finished, she said, ""Yeah, you have a little fluid."" Left the room and didn't really say what the next steps where, so I sat and waited.

Next the phlebotomist came in, which was super weird, because we usually go to her office right off the lobby.  As she was taking my blood I asked what they were testing for and she starts listing things and then gets panicky and looks at my husband and says, ""oh shoot! I forgot a lavender vial! Could you go run to my lab and get 2 for me?"" He obliged her, and we sat and chatted with the needle in my arm so she didn't have to re-poke me.  She apologized profusely, but I told her not to worry about it because she was my favorite phlebotomist and these were weird conditions anyway. She said it made her day, so there is that :-D

Shortly after she left, an RE and just about all the other RNs that had been in previously came back in. That's when I knew something might not be right. She told me that I had a ""ton"" of fluid in my abdomen. It was all around my diaphragm, liver, and kidneys.  Also, my ovaries were literally floating in fluid, so the sharp pains I was feeling when I tried to move were them rotating lightly. (i.e. precursor to ovarian torsion). Then I was told about 12 times that I must have an extremely high pain tolerance, which at least made me feel like less of a wimp and vindicated for coming in. 

But then the final bomb was dropped. They needed to drain the fluid immediately. How you may wonder? Vaginally. With a needle. an no anesthesia...... WTF?!?!

The actual procedure wasn't has bad as it initially sounded. They gave me IV ibuprofen, nausea meds, antibiotics, and just a touch of narcotics. There was no local numbing though unfortunately.  The RE opted not to use a speculum, which I am grateful for. She swabbed the internal penetration site with iodine, which was surprisingly one of the most uncomfortable parts. Then came the US with a shielded needle next to it. I'm presuming this is extremely similar, if not the same set up they use for ER, except instead of collecting eggs they were going to drain fluid.

She looked around for awhile until she found a spot she felt she could penetrate and get a good amount of fluid out. Then she pressed really hard with the US first, to disperse some pressure, and then came the BIG poke. It was a momentary intense pain and then just extremely uncomfortable while we sat and waited for the fluid to drain.

There were actually about 5 people in the procedure room. I had one nurse designated to hold my hand and another in charge of music to make me forget about the giant needle in my vag. But then as we were waiting, more people kept stopping by to take a look at what was going on.  (All the Dr's, Residents, etc.) Finally I asked how often they have to do this procedure.  My RE immediately said, ""Maybe once a year!"" In a clinic that only does fertility treatment... I must be special.

They ended up getting about 2L of fluid out, but speculated I had a lot more up higher that they weren't able to get.  However, I felt immediately better. I literally waddled in all hunched over, unable to sit or move and walked out practically doing back flips by comparison.

I can't say that I would recommend a twat needling, but it's so much better than the pain I was in yesterday morning.  Here's to hoping the worst of it is over and I won't have to do that again.

<p>I figured I would share my experience with the group in case anyone else ends up dealing with severe OHSS they might know what to expect.</p>

<p>Yesterday I posted in the daily about considering contacting my RE&#39;s office after having severe abdominal pain 6 days post ER. I shot off an email to my IVF Coordinator and decided to try and shower to see if it helped at all. Flash to 10 min later and I am curled up in a soaking wet ball, dry heaving uncontrollably while my husband is brushing his teeth helplessly asking if there is anything he can do to help.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I immediately called my office after the heaving stopped and they got me an appointment 2 hours later. I made my husband stay home so he could drive me to the appointment because at this point I wasn&#39;t even able to dress myself, let alone drive anywhere. I left the house in slippers, 3/4 length workout pants from Costco, and a T-shirt.  No bra and no make up. Then I threw on my longest coat to try and hide, which I realize now looks a little like a house coat when worn with slippers. I&#39;ve never felt sexier, let me tell you.</p>

<p>The 30 min drive was excruciating for me. Every bump in the road caused unbearable pain to my ovaries and abdomen that nearly caused me to puke. Once we were called back to be seen, I was weighed and my &quot;abdominal girth&quot; was measured (at 8&quot; larger than normal). Again, never felt sexier.</p>

<p>I talked to the RN for a long time about my symptoms. Basically until it looked like I might pass out and she forced me to lay down.  Which was ok, because it was time for a good old fashion twat wanting. She was in there for a long time to measure my ovaries, fluid amount and blood flow to my ovaries, which she said was good.  When she finished, she asked me to stay lying down and went to consult with another RN.</p>

<p>She then came back with an US tech that was going to do an abdominal US.  That tech scanned my abdomen from underwear line to bra line and all the way she could reach around before hitting the table.  When she finished, she said, &quot;Yeah, you have a little fluid.&quot; Left the room and didn&#39;t really say what the next steps where, so I sat and waited.</p>

<p>Next the phlebotomist came in, which was super weird, because we usually go to her office right off the lobby.  As she was taking my blood I asked what they were testing for and she starts listing things and then gets panicky and looks at my husband and says, &quot;oh shoot! I forgot a lavender vial! Could you go run to my lab and get 2 for me?&quot; He obliged her, and we sat and chatted with the needle in my arm so she didn&#39;t have to re-poke me.  She apologized profusely, but I told her not to worry about it because she was my favorite phlebotomist and these were weird conditions anyway. She said it made her day, so there is that :-D</p>

<p>Shortly after she left, an RE and just about all the other RNs that had been in previously came back in. That&#39;s when I knew something might not be right. She told me that I had a &quot;ton&quot; of fluid in my abdomen. It was all around my diaphragm, liver, and kidneys.  Also, my ovaries were literally floating in fluid, so the sharp pains I was feeling when I tried to move were them rotating lightly. (i.e. precursor to ovarian torsion). Then I was told about 12 times that I must have an extremely high pain tolerance, which at least made me feel like less of a wimp and vindicated for coming in. </p>

<p>But then the final bomb was dropped. They needed to drain the fluid immediately. How you may wonder? Vaginally. With a needle. an no anesthesia...... WTF?!?!</p>

<p>The actual procedure wasn&#39;t has bad as it initially sounded. They gave me IV ibuprofen, nausea meds, antibiotics, and just a touch of narcotics. There was no local numbing though unfortunately.  The RE opted not to use a speculum, which I am grateful for. She swabbed the internal penetration site with iodine, which was surprisingly one of the most uncomfortable parts. Then came the US with a shielded needle next to it. I&#39;m presuming this is extremely similar, if not the same set up they use for ER, except instead of collecting eggs they were going to drain fluid.</p>

<p>She looked around for awhile until she found a spot she felt she could penetrate and get a good amount of fluid out. Then she pressed really hard with the US first, to disperse some pressure, and then came the BIG poke. It was a momentary intense pain and then just extremely uncomfortable while we sat and waited for the fluid to drain.</p>

<p>There were actually about 5 people in the procedure room. I had one nurse designated to hold my hand and another in charge of music to make me forget about the giant needle in my vag. But then as we were waiting, more people kept stopping by to take a look at what was going on.  (All the Dr&#39;s, Residents, etc.) Finally I asked how often they have to do this procedure.

41,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,

For those of you who have done multiple rounds of IVF, is there anything you wish you had changed about your protocol or would ask for next time? I know a lot of it is trial and error with a massive dose of luck in there. But as I'm heading to IVF #5 soon, and my RE is very open to my suggestions. 

My background:
We are doing day 3 pgs with day 5 tranfer, because we haven't had a lot of luck with getting things past day 5 to freeze. So day 3 numbers are what matter a lot now, as you want them high for the PGS. We only decided on PGS after IVF 2, due to mc.

IVF 1 - Gonal + luveris protocol - retrieved 15 -failed fresh transfer, but I had around 8 or so embryos on day 3 (no pgs)

IVF 2 - Gonal+luveris -retrieved 11(I think)- had 5 blasts on day 5, successful fresh transfer (MC at 12w) (no pgs)

IVF 3- menopur protocol - retrieved 8- only had 2 to freeze on day 3. All frozen for future PGS

IVF 4- menopur protocl -retrieved 5 - only 1 to freeze on day 3

Cetrotide used on all 4 cycles, I think starting around day 8ish.
ICSI done on all, and PCISI done on IVF 4. 
Only did BCP for IVF 3 due to a dominant follicle. All others were with no BCP. I thought maybe that was to blame for low numbers on IVF 3, but then IVF 4 seems to indicate it's the menopur.

MFI is the only known issue we have. We did an Ovidrel trigger each time.


So for me, I'm asking to go back on the gonal/luveris combo, as my retrieval numbers went way down on menopur. I'm going to ask they do PICSI again (though it didn't seem to help anything). For IVF #1 my husband had been on HCG shots for about 2.5 months and they did a testicle biopsy, that was also used for IVF #2.
IVF #3 and 4 were at the new clinic, with fresh samples, and he did HCG shots only while I stimmed. 

Anything else you'd think to ask to change? HCG trigger instead of Ovidrel? HGH?

***edit*** Added that I used cetrotide on all 4 protocols also.

<p>I had an ER on 10/28 with 9 eggs retrieved, and after genetic testing was done on the 3 blasts that made it to day 5, only 1 was definitively normal (one was abnormal, and one was inconclusive). Even before getting these results, we were pretty sure we wanted to try for another retrieval before the FET, as my AMH and FSH are good, and I am only 32. I met with my RE and he said he would have expected a better response from my ovaries given my age and AMH levels, so he is recommending the Lupron flare protocol this time to hopefully get a better response. I just wanted to ask around if anyone else has done this protocol, and if so, what your experiences were (especially if you first did a different type of protocol and then did Lupron flare). I did an antagonist protocol first, and other than not getting as many eggs as we hoped, it wasn&#39;t too terrible from a physical standpoint but I wasn&#39;t sure if the Lupron flare would be an entirely different experience. Any thoughts or advice? Thanks so much, everyone.</p>

I'm doing CCS after my ER early December (currently estimated 5th Dec but will be +- few days at this point) and trying to figure out roughly the time-line involved (particularly because of end of year shut-down). Few questions that I don't seem to find the answers to [of course I'm a long way from that yet, this is assuming there is something to freeze and test]

1) What drugs do they put you on after ER if there's no fresh transfer? I mean before the FET protocol really begins (my 'calendar' for FET starts on day 1 of period)

summary: either nothing or progesterone (for 10 days) or low dose aspirin (if already taken during stims)

2) I guess they make you have a period before starting on the FET protocol? If true: how long was it for you between ER and getting your period? 

summary: yes. and this should be ~ normal luteal phase length or a bit shorter. The range was ~8-12 days

3) How long was the whole the process between the ER and FET transfer day? How many appointments did you have and when?

summary: depended if it was a Lupron protocol or not. Generally non-Lupron was about 1 month from ER to FET, for Lupron was more like 2 months. There were fewer appointments and most were US to check the lining thickness (frequency of US seems to vary quite a bit depending on protocol and clinic, and probably individual person's progress).
There was also quite a variation of drugs taken during the FET part, so check the exact protocol you will be on.

My clinic is closed 23rd Dec to 2nd Jan and I'm trying to figure out a) if we could have a FET in January and b) if I can go home for the holidays for a bit. The nurse says there is some flexibility build into the schedule, I guess on the number of days on Etrace (or similar) and the dose there?

Summary: of course this would be the worst possible timing... but one user nicely pointed out that they can put you on BCP for a 'while' to make things line up, so hopefully that's what is going to happen: BCP so that the first US would be when the clinic is open again. Fingers crossed!

RE said IUI wouldn&#39;t really be helpful as the fluid acts like a &quot;swimming pool&quot; so implantation on its own would be difficult. I&#39;ve done lots of research over the months, and there isn&#39;t much that is out there for uterus/endometrial fluid. After researching, I&#39;m going to mention if a 2nd hysteroscopy or if a lap would be recommended to take a better look to see where this fluid could be coming from; see if taking Mucinex helps during fertile week and beyond in case the fluid is mucus-y; and if I should be going in for ultrasounds to see if the fluid is there during an entire cycle. Has anyone dealt with something similar, and outcomes? Guidance? my heart goes out to everyone here. </p>

I'm 34, my partner is 43 with two children from a previous marriage. I've had irregular cycles (sometimes bleeding every 2 or 3 weeks) for years. I also got my period when I was very young. I've never used birth control so that can't explain the weird cycles. They're more regular now, for the time. 2 years ago I had a vaginal ultrasound: I was hoping to get some answers and everything came back normal. My recent cd21 blood work came back fine except for my AMH which was a disappointing 0.8 my partner's SA came back with 1% normal and a problem with the heads. He is doing another SA tomorrow morning before our appointment. Our doc said being a smoker could cause that but he isn't a smoker. They've said tomorrow's will be a practice prep for more in depth info. I'm not totally sure what that entails. Any ideas?
I had CD3 labs done yesterday and should have the results later today.

Overall, the D&C went ok. The surgery itself was fine, I felt ok to go to work the day after. I had some period-like bleeding for about 4 days, then it tapered off, and then day 7 had some very, very heavy bleeding (to the point I was dizzy). So I got an ultrasound and of course by the time I get there, the bleeding had stopped completely and everything was just fine. Only some very light spotting for about a week after that. By 2 weeks after the procedure, I was pretty much back to normal (sex still felt weird for another several days or so).

When we had our miscarriage, others who had one told me that time helps. It felt like time was standing still right after we found out, but now it's been a few weeks and I can say that time *DOES* help. I feel much, much better and have mentally been able to move on pretty well. I got a beautiful double-emerald necklace (May birthstone) as a memento, and I've been talking with people about my experience. Talking about it has helped so, so much. Each time I was able to be open about it, a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I felt so silly for trying to keep all my infertility stuff so private considering how wonderful everyone has been to us. Our friends and family just want to see us happy and celebrate with us, and be there for us during hard times (especially my dad, *tear*). I'm so happy to truly see that now.

I had my follow-up appointment yesterday with the OB. We did testing on the embryonic tissue and it all came back Normal XX (so small chance it could be my tissue). Just in case, they're going to get our insurance to approve chromosomal testing for my husband and I, and then blood clotting testing for me. It's good news things came back normal, but I almost wish I had some answers! My OB said I can categorize myself in the group of women who just got ""shit luck"", haha - it sounds harsh when I type it, but she is so kind and encouraging and it was nice to hear this.

So, we'll do the next step of testing ourselves, maybe see if we can get a free baby in the next 2 months (ha), and start back up on birth control in the new year for our next FET. It's kind of nice to know that we can't start treatment again til next year because it's easier to push it out of my mind.

Also, thank you to all you ladies for being so wonderful and kind as we went through this.

I&#39;ve had recurrent miscarriage so I&#39;m not sure why wed do a blastocyst that wasn&#39;t tested. I got the drugs (progesterone in oil) and took the first dose just in case, to buy time to make sense of it. 
Any ideas?</p>

This isn't a decision I'm making lightly, and in fact it has taken me much longer to come to terms with moving on than I ever would have expected.

/r/infertility has been an important--at times even defining--part of my life for the past four years. A lot has changed in that time. When I joined there were fewer than 600 members here. Now we're pushing 5000. Back then our only written rule was to be kind to each other, but our small group had a unique culture with its own unspoken customs. 

As we grew, those customs evolved. At times, /r/infertility has been a place where it was safe to be incredibly bitter. At other times, the community has focused more on realistic optimism. My goal as mod was to protect the needs of the community, even as those needs fluctuated back and forth between those extremes. Still, at our core, the goal always remained to be kind, supportive, and awesome--even if said awesomeness sometimes came with a healthy dose of profanity! Ultimately, this is a very special corner of the internet, and it has been my privledge to be your mod. It has been an adventure like no other. 

I couldn't step down without knowing I was leaving this community in good hands. I feel entirely confident that, lead by Vexwyf, the current mod squad will have your backs and continue to keep /r/infertility the sort of place we all need.  

I know you'll help them out by continuing to be awesome to each other. Because that's the community you've built, and you should be proud of that.

<p>As we grew, those customs evolved. At times, <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a> has been a place where it was safe to be incredibly bitter. At other times, the community has focused more on realistic optimism. My goal as mod was to protect the needs of the community, even as those needs fluctuated back and forth between those extremes. Still, at our core, the goal always remained to be kind, supportive, and awesome--even if said awesomeness sometimes came with a healthy dose of profanity! Ultimately, this is a very special corner of the internet, and it has been my privledge to be your mod. It has been an adventure like no other. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t step down without knowing I was leaving this community in good hands. I feel entirely confident that, lead by Vexwyf, the current mod squad will have your backs and continue to keep <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a> the sort of place we all need.  </p>

<p>I know you&#39;ll help them out by continuing to be awesome to each other. Because that&#39;s the community you&#39;ve built, and you should be proud of that. </p>

I am at a point where I am just realizing that it may not happen for me... it's been a long and traumatic journey... here is the Cliff Notes version:
Married at 36 years old to older man who swore he wanted kids (already had 2 who lived with us). Once married, he confessed ""I lied... don't want more... I actually really lied to myself and thereby you... but regardless, I wanted to try and get there but realize I can't... so we're already married... we'll figure it out down the road!

By the grace of God, met my now partner who proposed within 6 months of meeting me and swore he wanted kids... 5 IUI and 2 failed IVF later - I am turning 40 in one month and can't believe this moment is here.
I am 40.
I have never been pregnant.
I seem to not be able to get pregnant?
(complete unexplained infertility.. he's fine and I'm fine after a trillion tests.. we are apparently just ""old"" me 40 him 44)
So here I am... wondering.. when does everyone give up? When do you stop being tortured by not being able to procreate? To not be a mother? Make your partner a father? When is enough.. enough?

I have no answers for this... my guy wants to give up on IVF and just see what happens even though we are fortunate that we have two more cycles covered in IL...

Help me please... be realistic and responsible and say - after all this mess, muck, and emotional warfare... find a way to be complete with your person who you are so, so lucky to have?

Or....

 keep trying.. because you will regret it every single day of your life if you dont do everything you can?

Today, we had a consult with a fertility clinic in LA (we just moved here), and I absolutely LOVE the RE we chose! She's awesome! Totally awesome! She was all ""tell me about your journey."" Then, I was all ""in May of 2014 I had my IUD removed...[insert our sad sob story]...all of our embryo's died, we want to try IVF again, but do it way different."" 

I had all of these questions to ask about: can we skip the BCPs, can we do a fresh day 3 transfer, can we bypass ICSI and not do PGS, what about my vitamin D levels, micro-flare or natural IVF, the list was extensive. But, by the time she was done explaining everything she would do differently for us, she had answered all of my questions! She explained everything so perfectly for my husband too. She was really skilled at reading hubs and knowing when he needed additional explanation, too; that was just so great. She referred to herself as the Monday morning quarterback because she has so much information to work from from our first failed IVF. So, husband likes her too. :)

So, the plan for IVF #2 is no priming, YAY! I was way over suppressed for my first IVF with BCPs and Lupron, so this makes me happy. Even if it doesn't work, it's nice to know I'm changing it up. I'll get a baseline on my next CD2 (should be in two weeks) and I'll start aggressive stims that day, then I'll add in an antagonist like Ganirelix to prevent ovulation and then, retrieval when the follicles are ready. During the first rodeo, I stimmed for 14 damn days, she says this time will likely be way less, so yay! Also, thanks to the amazing graduates from our sub, I have most if not all of the Menopur I need and likely enough Gonal-F refills from our TI/injectable cycle (my insurance company paid for the meds as long as we did TI, so stupid!) so I think the only meds I will need to buy is the antagonist. 

Also, I'm DOR, AMH=0.5, but my response to stims, except during the IVF cycle, has always been pretty good, surprising even. New RE asked what my AFC was or has been, and I said my old clinic never did an AFC. So, she did one today. I'm CD13, about to ovulate, so she said, including the egg about I'm about to lay, I've got 10 on the right and 5 on the left. *My AFC is 15 you guys!!!*

A little history time here. We did the first egg retrieval back in February. At that time we got 12 eggs and of those only 4 fertilized, and 3 made it to the blast stage. We did a fresh transfer with a perfect looking blast and that one made it 7 weeks before we lost it. After that I needed a mental and physical break for a bit so we didn't pick back up until the end of August or so when we did the FET. That one just didn't take.

At this point we'll need to do another stimulation and egg retrieval, I'm also sure that they are going to want to do more testing on me.

138,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Have you ever looked up the word “hope” in the thesaurus just to see what the antonyms are? Apparently, “reality” is an antonym of hope, and that gave me a chuckle. I haven’t always been this person though. This is my ironic, and somewhat interesting, journey of how I became a grayer version of myself.

My husband and I met at 8th grade graduation practice. I invited him along with our large group of mutual friends to walk back to my house after for pop cycles. We became fast friends after that. Summer after sophomore year in high school we went on our first real date, and we were inseparable after that. With being inseparable came an unplanned pregnancy in the spring of our senior year of high school. We were both under 18 at the time, had big hopes and dreams for ourselves as well as our child, and our parents weren’t in agreement on what we should do. My husband and I had long conversations and ultimately chose to place our son in an open adoption. We did the best we could in choosing parents for our son, and they stood by their word and we have been a part of their family ever since (our son recently turned 18).

It wasn’t long after high school graduation and our son’s birth that my husband and I moved in together. We were well on our way to being fully fledged adults and contributing to society. We were so young and naïve that the first few months were like a co-ed slumber party, and then the reality hit of how broke and struggling we were. Eventually my husband got an engineering degree and decent job and we slowly climbed out of poverty. We got married and after a few more years bought our first house with 3 full bedrooms. It was finally our time, time to have kids for keeps.

The first pregnancy seemed to happen fast. Wow, that was easy. I mean, I wasn’t too surprised. I did accidentally get pregnant when I thought we were being careful. We saw the baby for the first time on ultrasound at 10 weeks. Barely there but it had a little fluttering heartbeat we could see. A couple days later I started bleeding so we just went straight to the ER. After blood tests, ultrasounds, and what felt like an eternity waiting, the ER doctor finally bursts into our and asks, “Are you sure you were pregnant?” So that is how we found out about our first pregnancy loss.

From there the pregnancies were harder to come by shorter lived. Only the next few would actually be classified as pregnancy losses, because after that they failed so quickly they were deemed chemical pregnancies. Our RE at the time gave up on us. Had no idea what treatment plan to offer, so we gave up for a while. 

We took a good few years completely off with 0 positive pregnancy tests or chemical pregnancies, so whatever was wrong with me/us, it was getting worse. From more of a heath standpoint and based on symptoms, I chose to undergo laparoscopic surgery to determine if I had any endometriosis. The surgeon found some spots that he cleaned up and classified me as stage 1 of 4. 

We finally ended up seeing a new (much better) RE. We had to retake the barrage of test we had taken prior because years had passed, and stuff has obviously changed, so let’s get a new baseline. After a standard HSG revealed that my right fallopian tube was blocked, our new RE sent me to have an MRI of my uterus done. The results of that MRI revealed that my fibroids (which I’d known about) were far worse than anyone realized by looking at my uterus on ultrasound. I ended up having 2 separate surgeries to remove 14 fibroids in total. The largest fibroid was the size of a baseball and the smallest the size of a pea. That laparotomy was pretty hard to recover from both physically and mentally, and immediately after my husband moved across the country. I had to stay behind to recover with my mom and then return to work to pay for our mortgage back home while he started a new job in our new home. 

Our new RE (who is now our old RE because life doesn’t stop for infertility and we moved across the country), was confident this surgery was just the ticket and the answer to all our problems… but it wasn’t. So after settling into the new area and researching REs we got back to it.

Our secondary infertility is technically still undiagnosed. Our New new RE says there is no reason I shouldn’t be getting pregnant. We did a few more test, and we jumped straight to IUI. The first was unsuccessful, but the second one was a success!... until it wasn’t. The hCG barely climbed before it fell and they classified it as another chemical pregnancy. Based on that result, we went straight to IVF and that’s where we are now in our infertility journey. 

I’m sitting here at my computer typing all this out, cause I have nothing but time. My text book blastocyst is floating around in my uterus and I’m wording if I just wasted it, because they’re still in there. Some fibroids were missed or came back, it doesn’t really matter. My RE says they’re small, but they’ve made my uterus home again and I’m wondering if a baby even has a chance in that scarred battlefield. 

So who am I now, after all of this? I feel like the antonym of hope… Actually, that’s wrong. At this point, I’m not sure I really feel anything about it. I have no hope or expectation of what’s going to happen. It’s a sad kind of calm. Last time I thought to myself “You know, we only ended up with 2 blasts out of 8 fertilized eggs. Maybe we needed IVF. Maybe this will actually work.” I immediately scoffed/chuckled to myself and thought, ”That would be too easy.”

Bit of background, I have unexplained infertility, hubby has perfect sperm, never had a pregnancy or chemical pregnancy. I'm 26, I have been trying for a year and half. I'm on my 25th cycle or something.

After TTC for about a year we knew we had problems since I ovulate only about once every three months. I have PCO (but not the syndrome, according to my doctor, since my bloodwork is normal and I have no other symptoms other than cysts and an irregular cycle(?)). 

Turns out this wasn't our only problem, my SOs SA came back last week with very poor results. The count is 2 million/ml, and the other numbers are also low, with a lot of ""pin head"" sperms. His doctor told us we now have to go straight to IVF.

I have read here on this sub that you have to get a new SA if the first one is poor, since it can vary. But is there any hope that my SOs SA was only a ""fluke"" when his numbers are this terrible? He already lives a very healthy lifestyle with no smoking, drinking etc., so I don't feel there is much more he can do to improve his numbers.

I have one hope though: This summer he was absent from work for 3 months because of stress- and anxiety-issues, he often woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat.

<p>After TTC for about a year we knew we had problems since I ovulate only about once every three months. I have PCO (but not the syndrome, according to my doctor, since my bloodwork is normal and I have no other symptoms other than cysts and an irregular cycle(?)). </p>

<p>Turns out this wasn&#39;t our only problem, my SOs SA came back last week with very poor results. The count is 2 million/ml, and the other numbers are also low, with a lot of &quot;pin head&quot; sperms. His doctor told us we now have to go straight to IVF.</p>

<p>I have read here on this sub that you have to get a new SA if the first one is poor, since it can vary. But is there any hope that my SOs SA was only a &quot;fluke&quot; when his numbers are this terrible? He already lives a very healthy lifestyle with no smoking, drinking etc., so I don&#39;t feel there is much more he can do to improve his numbers.</p>

<p>I have one hope though: This summer he was absent from work for 3 months because of stress- and anxiety-issues, he often woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. I don&#39;t want to get my hopes up, but I have also read that stress can impact semen - but can it have such an huge impact? There is a long way from a 2 mill count to a 20 mill count...</p>

Short-ish version: 30 yo, husband 40, trying for little over a year, no luck, super super low AMH (<0.5, undetectable), repeated, only a tiny bit higher on repeat = primary ovarian insufficiency, now doing IVF, finishing up first cycle now, retrieval probably Monday, so far I have few side effects (don't be jealous, it's only because I only have 4 follicles growing). 

So, here is where I struggle:
-I'm only fucking 30. Everyone says ""you have plenty of time"" which normally is totally true and I would never encourage anyone to have kids before they're ready, and I know I'm the exception to the rule and this is weird what's happening but WTF! 30?!?! I feel lied to by society at large, which I know is ridiculous but can't help it 

-We don't actually know why I haven't gotten pregnant. I was ovulating every month, and this ovarian insufficient thing was almost like an incidental finding. Hopefully it won't matter bc we're doing FET and my uterus appears normal, but I can't help but feel like there may be more bad news lurking. We're doing IVF mainly to preserve the option of having more than one kid, bc if I just got pregnant, by the time I had kiddo and was ready for a second I would be out of eggs.

-My mom was 40 at menopause: I really really really wish someone had told me this. I was a kid, I didn't know! But that's pretty young and mom's age is the best predictor for when a women will go through it. So between her and my super low AMH I'm looking at menopause by 40, hopefully not sooner. ""Oh Beckella, these are your new friends, osteoporosis, hot flashes and dry vag. You should get to know each other, you're going to be friends about a DECADE sooner than you thought.""

Anyway, finally had my first appointment at a fertility clinic, and I really need somewhere to let everything all out, so this will probably be one big long ramble. Apologies in advance for anyone who reads this!

Bit of background here as well: I'm pretty young, and my ovaries have never produced enough estrogen. This has been a bit of a puzzling factor for my doctors (karyotypes and everything else is fine), and no one has really known what to do with me, so I've had quite a few random diagnostic tests done. As we're pretty young, the boy and I aren't actually trying yet, so I kinda feel that I don't fit here (yet). But after two years of not much, I finally get my referral to the clinic, and fly down for the day. Doctor does some standard medical googling, and lets me know that this is quite an unusual situation, just in case I wasn't already aware. I then have my first twat wanding experience (and also my second, because no one told me to pee first...oops). I'm still not too sure how to feel about that - it was more and less painful, and also a lot less awkward than I imagined, considering the two doctors, one resident (I think?) and nurse who were all there as well. They were all really lovely though, and I have endless appreciation for them for laughing at my silly jokes and being friendly, it made everything a lot less stressful. 

Anyway, after having my ovaries sufficiently prodded, it turns out they have no, or very few follicles. Which explains the lack of estrogen, and also means no/low eggs. I'm also getting my AHM/FSH/etc checked again just to confirm, but I'm pretty sure this is it. Primary Ovarian Insufficiency. I'm kind of happy I've finally got an official diagnosis, the closest thing to a reason for this mess. Apparently there's a 5% chance we could *just get pregnant*, but that seems pretty unlikely to me. 

The stupidest part of the whole thing is I feel so conflicted about everything. I almost feel lucky that we can't get pregnant right now, but then really upset for the next few years as well.

The background- 31 in December, PCOS, one ovary remaining due to a borderline malignant tumor on my right ovary that was surgically removed several years ago. 

My periods have always been pretty regular, which led me to mistakenly assume I was ovulating- not the case. I have all the infertility blood work done and my husband did a semen analysis, all was good except I wasn't ovulating. HSG was also fine which was a relief because there was some concern for tube blockage due to my previous surgeries and scar tissue.


Clomid did nothing for me, but I ovulated 3 cycles on 10mg of letrozole. But no pregnancy. Before proceeding after the 3rd round, my doctor wanted me to come in again. I decided it was a good time to take a break and focus on weight loss with Keto, and have lost 25 pounds since my first femara cycle. 

However, I am getting impatient. I want to make an appointment with my doctor to see what she suggests next, and ask specifically about IUI in conjunction with femara. My previous medicated cycles were not monitored through ultrasound, but ovulation was confirmed with CD21 progesterone readings and I ovulated like clockwork each cycle, on cycle day 14. 

With all this in mind, from what you know or experienced, what next steps should I specifically ask about? Is IUI going to have a higher chance of conception with femara, since the femara did make me ovulate? It seems to me that it should have a pretty good chance with us since the medication does make me ovulate. 

Thoughts, insight, opinions? Also, I am on metformin but am terrible about taking it, it's a work in progress.

I decided it was a good time to take a break and focus on weight loss with Keto, and have lost 25 pounds since my first femara cycle. </p>

<p>However, I am getting impatient. I want to make an appointment with my doctor to see what she suggests next, and ask specifically about IUI in conjunction with femara. My previous medicated cycles were not monitored through ultrasound, but ovulation was confirmed with CD21 progesterone readings and I ovulated like clockwork each cycle, on cycle day 14. </p>

<p>With all this in mind, from what you know or experienced, what next steps should I specifically ask about? Is IUI going to have a higher chance of conception with femara, since the femara did make me ovulate? It seems to me that it should have a pretty good chance with us since the medication does make me ovulate. </p>

<p>Thoughts, insight, opinions? Also, I am on metformin but am terrible about taking it, it&#39;s a work in progress. </p>

Some background: I have Asherman's (intrauterine adhesions or scar tissue) and my husband's sperm is wack.  I had two hysteroscopic surgeries in 2015 trying to remove this fucking scar tissue.  It's ""a mild case"" just a couple of bands of adhesions.  But they are stubborn.  After the second surgery, I had a uterine balloon in me for a week to try to prevent the scars from reforming.  It was painful and traumatic.  Afterwards, I projectile vomited into a grocery bag and then threw the bag out the car window.  Sorry, mother nature!

In January I had a saline sono and was cleared to TTC.  We did 2 IUIs which were jokes (sperm is really wack) and then we goofed off all year until we finally managed to do IVF in September.  

Well, we crushed IVF.  I declared myself the valedictorian of IVF (My RE refuses to refer to me with this title.  Why?!)   23 eggs retrieved.  All mature.  100% fertilization rate with ICSI.  12 blastocysts remaining on Day 5.  All grade Asomething.   The transfer resulted in a chemical and I just had a nagging feeling that my uterus is busted again.

And I'm right!  Asherman's is back with a vengence.  It's only 1 single little band of scar tissue right at the top.  But it's enough to hinder implantation.  I have my 3rd surgery on Monday.  This will be my final surgery.  If I can't get the scar tissue to get out and stay the fuck out, I'm not doing this again.  I'm too exhausted.

I cannot believe I have 20k worth of perfect embryos and literally no uterus to put them into.  

So, enough about me.  Anyone else had to deal with Asherman's?  How did things shake out for you?  How many surgeries?  Did you also join the facebook group and realize it's full of actual insane people?

I apologize if this is long, but there are a lot of meds, side effects, and general feelings I wish to put out there, so here it goes: At the end of September I started my period, and my doctor put me on the birth control Reclipsen in anticipation of starting IVF. I was to be on that for 3 weeks, and then the real shit begins. Unfortunately, Reclipsen made me nauseous. It took me 2 weeks to realize I wasn't coming down with something and it could be this medication. By that point, I only had another 5 days until I was off it, so I didn't want to mess with the process by complaining about my bc pill side effects. I think that got me off in the wrong foot, because I haven't felt normal in my stomach or digestive track since before starting that Reclipsen in September. After that, came the 300IU of Gonal F and 2 vials of Menapur each night for a while, until the evening of 10/26/16 when I had to start my antagonist (Cetritide). The next morning I threw up. It was awful. I continued to feel generally worse after that. Additionally by this time, my ovaries are like ripe grape bunches causing me pressure and discomfort with every step, twist, and sit down. My final ultrasound revealed 15 swollen 14+mm follicles on my right ovary alone, and half again as many on the left. The night of 10/28 (or morning of 10/29) at 1am, I took my hCG trigger shot, and by 6am I was full on vomiting and not even keeping water down. I finally call my Dr at 3pm and got a prescription for zofran to hold me over until my egg retrieval procedure the next day, Sunday 10/30. When Sunday came, it didn't go smoothly. I warned them that my right ovary was in a wonky place thanks to a myomectomy laparotomy I had April 2015, and it proved to be challenging. They had to poke and prod and apply so much pressure to retrieve eggs that I needed Oxycodone to recover. So after the retrieval, I got to stop taking Gonal F and Menapur, but had to start Medrol, Doxycycline, progesterone, and now oxycodone for pain. By implantation day, I was nauseous, constipated, and still in pain on my right side. I had the Doctor check that ovary and he says it's okay, just a little swollen still. So that's where I am right now. Implantation day was today, and I have no idea how I made it here. We harvested 13 eggs that Sunday, 11 matured, 8 were fertilized, and 2 made it to blastocyst stage, one being a particular front runner.

It was awful. I continued to feel generally worse after that. Additionally by this time, my ovaries are like ripe grape bunches causing me pressure and discomfort with every step, twist, and sit down. My final ultrasound revealed 15 swollen 14+mm follicles on my right ovary alone, and half again as many on the left. The night of 10/28 (or morning of 10/29) at 1am, I took my hCG trigger shot, and by 6am I was full on vomiting and not even keeping water down. I finally call my Dr at 3pm and got a prescription for zofran to hold me over until my egg retrieval procedure the next day, Sunday 10/30. When Sunday came, it didn&#39;t go smoothly. I warned them that my right ovary was in a wonky place thanks to a myomectomy laparotomy I had April 2015, and it proved to be challenging. They had to poke and prod and apply so much pressure to retrieve eggs that I needed Oxycodone to recover. So after the retrieval, I got to stop taking Gonal F and Menapur, but had to start Medrol, Doxycycline, progesterone, and now oxycodone for pain. By implantation day, I was nauseous, constipated, and still in pain on my right side. I had the Doctor check that ovary and he says it&#39;s okay, just a little swollen still. So that&#39;s where I am right now. Implantation day was today, and I have no idea how I made it here. We harvested 13 eggs that Sunday, 11 matured, 8 were fertilized, and 2 made it to blastocyst stage, one being a particular front runner. I&#39;m trying my best to rest right now wondering if I will ever feel normal again. I would love to hear about everyone else&#39;s egg retrieval stories. </p>

I've been casually lurking, but it's been a mental hurdle to feel like I even belong here. There's so much good info in here though I'm kicking myself for not having embraced it sooner.

Just a bit of background, SO and I are 34 and first started trying over 4 years ago. I just wrote a long post on our history in another related sub so I don't want to repeat it again here.

After reading some very informative posts in the sub, I have been exposed to this idea of the 3 IUI/IVF train. Hello, didn't know that had a name, didn't know it was a thing. Thought it was just me being weird in my head.

Basically after seeing a RE and having some tests done, we were told we are unexplained. I was given a prescription for Serophene and told to phone in when I got a positive OPK and then come in for an IUI. Which we could try up to 3 times.

It seemed weird and to me like it was leaving too many things unanswered. When reading other subs it seemed like there were so many other tests or interim steps or monitoring that could be done. So instead of moving ahead with that, we continued to try on our own. Which hasn't worked out for us, so now I'm back to considering the IUI, but again, it just seems like some random roll of the die, the results of which I get to live with for the rest of my life.

In the last couple of months, I did go see an Accupuncturist who asked me why I had never had a progesterone check done at 21days/7dpo to confirm ovulation. I went to see a walk-in Dr to request the blood work, and they were also surprised it hadn't already been done since it's supposed to be a pretty basic check.

So now this has me questioning what are some other things that may have been missed.

The RE clinic we were referred to is very well regarded. This isn't something I've talked to many people with, but when I have mentioned it, it's a clinic that people have heard of and know to be a good one.

I guess I'm just feeling like a statistic and I don't know exactly how to navigate this system or try to advocate for myself. How would I even find out what other tests may have been missed? Or what other investigative options would make sense to try to make sure the IUIs are not a waste of my time/money and at this point limited emotional resilience?

Here's what we've had done so far:
- SA/bloodwork for SO
- Lots for bloodwork for me, including day 3, and just recently 21 day progesterone (came back unusually high, whatever that could mean)
- Ultrasound
- HSG

It always felt a little too good to be true (or maybe too crazy to be true? who has their HCG slow down, go negative, then pick back up again and have a healthy pregnancy?)

Alas, it was.  I had a little bit of red spotting yesterday after a bowel movement, and I was hoping it was just due to an irritated cervix.  Had some more this morning, but it stopped again so I was hopeful.  But then at about 12:30 I went to the bathroom and had a big gush of blood.  I called my clinic right away and was able to get in for a 2:00 ultrasound.  By then I was DEFINITELY miscarrying, cramps, lots of blood, etc.  Luckily I hadn't passed the sac yet though, so they were able to visualize it and see that there was no yolk sac anymore, and what was left of the fetus was difficult to find and there was definitely no heartbeat.  They measured what they could and it was still sitting at 6w1d.  I'm guessing it stopped within 24 hours of that ultrasound on Monday.

I was really glad that we were able to confirm it was a loss before a miscarriage, instead of a loss due to a miscarriage.  It makes me feel better about the whole thing.  I also was always really concerned about the HCG crazy and it never felt like it was right or healthy.  I'd rather it all happen now before we felt like we were really attached and really hopeful, rather than a loss much further down the line.

Anyway, the MC is happening swiftly now, by the time I got home from the clinic I was passing big clots, so I hope it'll be over soon enough.  And I will be having a glass of wine or 4 tonight.

First time posting, so I hope this is the correct section.
I am going through egg freezing at the age of 31 after cancer. 

My first appointment in October, I had 58 antral follicles. I was eating great, had low stress, and I was excited to start. However, due to my not having a period they decided to wait so they could determine my exact cycle by ovarian transvaginal ultrasound. I was put on 3 weeks of oral birth control.

Long story short. I have been under INCREDIBLE stress. My mother moved into my apartment for over month (longer story). My cat became sick from stress, and I also have been sick with bronchitis. My diet as gotten worse, and I have been having anxiety attacks. I do see a therapist & psychiatrist.


I found out today at my baseline that my antral count dropped to ~45. The tech noticed and recounted, saying she was sure there was some extra in the dark area. I suspect my actual count was closer to 43, but she saw I was freaking out. (She was nice enough to re-count the images from today and my last appointment )

My biggest rush was my insurance coverage is maxed out till the end of the year, and my clinic is closed by Dec. 15th. My insurance will only cover one round of retrieval ($10k max lifetime).

-Has anyone experienced anything similar?

-Is this drop due to stress, birth control or something else?

-Would you continue with your harvest if your numbers dropped like this? 

I feel totally alone in this. I am single. I have no partner, and I am currently unemployed. I want to make the best decision possible. I have $3500 worth of drugs in my fridge, and I am scared that I am pushing myself for subpar results. I would appreciate any feedback. This has been difficult for me, as my family is not encouraging my decision to freeze my eggs. Thank you for your time.

I've been lurking for a while as I've been through the long process of a cancelled cycle, a second IVF with ICSI and finally had my first FET after PGS.

After the FET I was feeling crummy, was busy with work but trying to stay calm... On day 5 post transfer I was feeling a bit desperate so I took matters into my own hands to relax and had an orgasm. I didn't receive any instructions not to from the clinic, but then googled it and saw some sites recommending no intercourse for first 7 days or at all during 2ww. **shit**.

Now I'm a few days out from my beta and kind of freaking out... What if I blew it? I know there's nothing I can do now... but what instructions did you get about intercourse/orgasm? Is there any evidence to support? Do you think they didn't say anything to me because they *assumed* I wouldn't want to?

Anyways, the plan was to do 3 IUI with femara + trigger, and 3 with injectable.

Wonder if I should just ask at this point to do directly to injectables. And when we might need to talk about IVF.

IUI are covered, but 6 IUI is nearly 4 K$ in donor sperm.
IVF is 5990$. I had OHSS both time, for add the cost of vitrification (1 000$) and potential FET (1750$).

If you're interested go to the link below and let us know when you might be available. With the holidays approaching I think the longer we wait, the more difficult a meeting would be so I picked some times over the next several evenings and over the weekend. We'll try to pick the best time and then figure out a location given the number of people.

As someone who tried for 5 years and has now gone over to infertility babies I am aware of the mind mess of all this.

However my circumstances were wrapped up in other health conditions, and so I'm wondering about supporting my friend who has been trying for 3 years and just had a lap showing everything is healthy except for blocked tubes.

I know I need to just love and listen to her but is there anything I should NOT say, are there treatment options available apart from IVF or is that the only way forward?

With IVF what is the process like in terms of follicle stimulation and the process involved? I know protocols will be different but is she looking at a 6 month lead time before starting, or much sooner? 

I feel like if I can understand a bit about what she is facing it may help me understand a bit more about where she is at, but again a lot of that will come from just catching up with her which she's asked to do. 

For anyone that has done or started IVF what have friends/family done for you that were helpful/harmful - so I can have some idea of things to do or avoid.

I´m 36 and have just been diagnosed with ovary insufficiency. I met my husband in my early thirties. We have a 2.5 year old daughter, everything was super easy the first time. Then we tried again once my cycle started again (after nursing my daughter) and it wouldn´t work. I had regular cycles and tracked my ovulation with those LH-sticks. After 9 months, I became pregnant but lost the baby in the first trimester. After that no cycles for 3 months, according to my gyno due to a ovarian cyst. Then again a few regular cycles and then just nothing since August. So on my insistence my gyno finally referred me to the hospital for a fertility check up. 

The doctor there was not a fan of me. She mocked the fact that I had been tracking my cycle (Ah you´re one of those over-controlling women) and she thought the fertility check-up was completely unnecessary since I had just been pregnant in february. The missed period was again because of a ovarian cyst. 

They induced a cycle with a gestagen and on the third day I had to come in and they took some hormones and counted my ovarian follicles. And in that ten-minute appointment, everything changed. While I was still on the gyno-chair, as soon as the ultrasound was finished the unempathic doctor told me that it was bad and that I would never be able to have a child again. She said, there was absolutely nothing they could do. No way to stimulate my ovaries, IVF is -according to her- out of the question. She predicted, I would never have a normal cycle again and would be spiraling into early menopause now. 

Apparently, instead of 8 follicles per ovary I only had 1-2, the anti-müller-hormone is 0.7 and the FSH very high. This is bad. Everything I´ve read also suggests that its really really bad. But on many sites I´ve read, there´s also talk of hope and possibilities. 

We´re absolutely destroyed. I´m 36. I was just pregnant a few months ago. I still had a normal cycle this summer (at least a few rounds). We always wanted a big family, a house full of laughter and a table full of children who tell stories. I can´t imagine life any other way. I loved being pregnant and the only way I dealt with my child growing so fast was the hope that we would soon have another baby.

The first  four days with the follitstim shots (225) went awesome and had me feeling like a bad-ass. But tonight I fell back down to earth. I had an adjusted protocol of 150 follistim, 1 syringe of ganirelex and 1 vial of menopur (3 shots).  I decided to switch up spots and try my thigh for the first time and it sucked!!! The ganirelex left a huge lump and hurt and the menopur stung like a bitch going in.  Maybe my thigh is just more sensitive then my stomach? 


 So my question is... from experience is there an order to these shots that minimizes pain?  When doing 3 at once do you try to stay in the same general (2-inch) area for all three?  Other then ice before and heat after, what else can I do to minimize the sting?   



Ugh and I haven't even gotten to the shot I fear the most yet. PIO.  Damn this sucks. 



EDIT- Update. I'm so relieved tonight's shots went so much better. The changes I made were: taking the follistim out of the fridge early, mixing the menopur early (which really brought the burn level down), and I had all three shots out and ready.

261,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Well I'm back and more bitter than ever. FET #2 was initially a success. Pregnancy was progressing relatively well before everything came crashing down 2 weeks ago at my 13 week NT scan.

We had decided to do genetic screening because our embryos were never PGS tested. At the ultrasound our little guy waved hello to us and resisted attempts by the tech to get him to roll over. My husband thought it was adorable because it reminded him of me when he tries to get me up in the morning. When they focused the scan on the heart my husband noticed something off: a bright white spot in the middle of the heart. He asked the tech what it was and she mumbled something about a reflection. OK... After that she measure the nuchal translucency (NT) and it measured normal so we breathed a sigh of relief because everything looked fine.

When the scan was done the genetic counselor came in and gave us the first of the bad news: our baby had a 1:59 chance of having trisomy 21 (aka Down syndrome). OK. That was a little worrisome but it was still only a 2% risk so we went with her to discuss additional testing. She suggested a more thorough blood test (NIPT) or invasive testing (CVS or amino). We opted for the blood test because there was an increased chance of miscarriage with the CVS and amino and I fucking hate huge needles. We figured that with only one blood result being abnormal and everything measuring ok on the ultrasound that there was a very good chance that this was just a false positive. The genetic counselor then sent us back to the waiting room while see finished up the paperwork for the NIPT testing. While we were sitting there surrounded by other happily pregnant couples the doctor came in and asked us to come back to the ultrasound room. There was something she wanted to check on. Okayyyyyy.... We followed her back and she scanned me again, looking closely at the heart and listening to the heartbeat. When she was done she told us the bad news. Our baby sounded like he had a leaky heart valve and she suspected an endocardial cushion defect. Not only that but that kind of defect is closely associated with Downs. So our formerly 2% chance just went to something like 90% in a span of 5 minutes. She told us she was sorry and recommended me do a CVS to confirm the diagnosis and that the prognosis is not good for a baby with both Downs and heart defect. We were then sent, stunned, back to the waiting room, once again surrounded by happy pregnant couples, to wait for the genetic counselor. When we saw her again her whole demeanour had changed. Instead of the cheerful look she had earlier, she now sported a look of sadness and pity. She explained that the NIPT was off the table and that our only options were cvs or amino. We asked her if the doctor was wrong and it was only a heart defect then what were our baby's chances. The genetic counselor said that if it was just the heart defect, the baby would require open heart surgery soon after birth. If it was both Downs and heart defect then they would advise not continuing the pregnancy because the complications of both would be too much.

I spent the next few days before the cvs scouring the internet for all I could find about congenital heart defects and Downs. It was not pretty. We were pretty much looking at multiple surgeries and hospital stays within the first few years of life and to top it off, people with Downs are not allowed on the heart transplant list. In short, the baby's quality of life would not be good. We decided then that if the results came back positive for trisomy 21 then we would TFMR. If it was negative, we would wait for the fetal echocardiogram at 20 weeks and hope that the heart defect wasn't as bad as the doctor thought it was before deciding to TFMR or not.

I'll spare you all the details about the CVS other than to say it did hurt but nowhere near as bad as a HSG and it was a fucking huge needle (according to my husband. I was too scared to look). We got the results on Monday and it was positive for trisomy 21. We were and still are devastated. 

So here I am. Termination was today so I'm in pain and emotional right now. I'm devastated I had to terminate a very much wanted pregnancy and have to go through the entire infertility process again. I'm pissed that I have to deal with people judging me for TFMR on top of all the shit I already get for infertility. Most of all, I'm pissed at the universe for making me think that things were finally looking up only to take EVERYTHING from me. And when I mean EVERYTHING, I'm not just talking about this pregnancy. I've been unemployed for over a year now and right after my transfer, I got a call from a company wanting to do an interview. The catch? The interview was the day before my beta. This is a company I desperately wanted to work for so I spent my tww studying and preparing for the interview. I figured if I could nail the interview and got the job, then it wouldn't hurt so much when I got my negative beta. I rocked the interview and got my positive beta. Whoo! Then on my birthday the district manager calls me and gives me a verbal job offer. BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER! We had a start date set up and everything. All I needed was the official offer and I could get my work visa (Canadian living in the US working in a desired field. Very easy for me to get a visa). Except the official offer never came. Apparently HR had issues with me needing a work visa. My start date came and passed with not so much of another peep from them.
