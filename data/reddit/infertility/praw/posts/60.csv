I am a 30yr old female, and me and my partner are dealing with male infertility. It was a huge shock. When we started trying I felt like something was wrong with my body because 3 years ago I had an unplanned pregnancy (bad situation- was single, the man literally fled the country upon finding out and wanted nothing to do with it), and decided not to go forward with it. I asked my doctor to test everything to make sure I was healthy and we soon discovered that although my body is in fine condition, my partner has azoospermia (unexplained).

After months of waiting to see a fertility specialist, we finally saw the doctor. He said since my partner has high FSH, low-average testosterone and smaller testicles, it’s probably not a blockage. We ruled out Kleinfelter’s Syndrome with a genetics test so now have no clue how it happened.

Thankfully, he is fine to use donor sperm if needed. The plan is as follows:

- see the urologist to time out a TESE the same time I can do an egg retrieval for ISCI procedure
- have donor sperm on hand if TESE is unsuccessful 

Timing seems long. Urologist appt isn’t until end-July and donor sperm is only ordered once a month in our clinic. In order to get the order in, we just do a mandatory donor orientation and counselling. This is fine but lots of waits until we can get in. Canada seems slow and sadly nothing is covered because we are in BC.

So I’m trying to deal with all this and on top of trying to be strong for my partner so he doesn’t feel guilty about his azoospermia (which is so out of his control I wish he didn’t feel guilty) I am still dealing with feelings like I am being punished for my previous “only chance” at being pregnant. Even though for me, It’s not about being pregnant, it’s about having a family with my loving partner, I still have these feelings of being punished / karma / etc.

In addition, my colleague is 8 months along and  has been talking about her unborn child since found out, and my 3 other colleagues have kids the same age. To listen to them talk and compare kids all day, everyday, has been a struggle. It’s all around me. My partner’s sister just announced. My best friend is trying. It’s partly my fault for not saying anything but I’m not ready to open up to anyone yet.

But, I would love to hear thoughts on my interpretation of them in my own case.

Background: unexplained infertility, had one AMH draw of .98 but AFC and FSH were not in line with DOR and second AMH draw was over 3.  We did one IUI with letrazole and a trigger shot that resulted in a 7 week miscarriage. After that it took a long time (over a month) for my HCG to go down and then I ended up needing a hysteroscopy and polypectomy, which I finally had done a week and a half ago. So finally I have my next steps meeting with my RE on Tuesday.

From the beginning I was skeptical of IUI because of low success rates for unexplained patients. We are completely out of pocket and even without all those HCG blood draws, extra saline sonograms, and the polypectomy, it cost nearly 2k. I have had way too much time to think about this since I’ve been in my REs care 7 months with just one IUI to show for it. But I am thinking about just wanting to move to IVF because the most likely outcome is we spend another 4k (decreasing our total IVF budget) and three months and are in the same boat of needing to move to IVF anyways. Am I being too hasty? 

Both REs at my clinic have said emphatically that the fact that I had a miscarriage from my first IUI doesn’t mean IUI is any more likely to work for me.  I am also wondering if more letrazole will lead to more polyps but there doesn’t seem to be enough evidence to support that.

27,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Question on surgically retrieved sperm quality.  Has anyone done 2 rounds of TESA or TESE with different results?  We were total noobs when husband had TESA then TESE, urologist didn’t mention anything that could affect quality... we’ve had bad results so I’m just wondering if anyone has done TESA or TESE more than once with dramatically different results.  I’m just second guessing everything and wonder if he should have changed diet or withheld alcohol before we started. And if it’s worth doing this and retrieving sworn again, if we go for round 4 or donor eggs.

All the details if it helps on input:
After a year of trying turns out husband has azoospermia, everything else normal so they decided probably tube damage during double hernia surgery as a toddler. 
Urologist was confident TESA was enough but it was a fail. He needled in further and found a few sperm, but not enough to freeze. On my first retrieval day, he had full on TESE, got some to use and freeze.  However after 2 ERs and ICSI (first with 12 all mature eggs, 11 fert with fresh sperm, 4 made it, 1 PGS norm. Second retrieval 8 eggs, 6 mature, 4 fert with frozen sperm, 0 made it.) we have 1 frozen but I’m 35 so we want to keep trying now before we transfer the 1.  Embryos stopped evenly throughout the days, and doc says the 3 PGS abnormal were slightly more related to egg quality.  But I’ve never shown any issues and my AMH was a 4.75, the clinic made us feel like once we got the sperm it would be such a breeze.

Has anyone done 2 rounds of TESA or TESE with different results?

I’m just second guessing everything and wonder if he should have changed diet or withheld alcohol before we started. And if it’s worth doing this and retrieving sworn again, if we go for round 4 or donor eggs.</p>

<p>All the details if it helps on input:
After a year of trying turns out husband has azoospermia, everything else normal so they decided probably tube damage during double hernia surgery as a toddler. 
Urologist was confident TESA was enough but it was a fail. He needled in further and found a few sperm, but not enough to freeze. On my first retrieval day, he had full on TESE, got some to use and freeze.  However after 2 ERs and ICSI (first with 12 all mature eggs, 11 fert with fresh sperm, 4 made it, 1 PGS norm. Second retrieval 8 eggs, 6 mature, 4 fert with frozen sperm, 0 made it.) we have 1 frozen but I’m 35 so we want to keep trying now before we transfer the 1.  Embryos stopped evenly throughout the days, and doc says the 3 PGS abnormal were slightly more related to egg quality.  But I’ve never shown any issues and my AMH was a 4.75, the clinic made us feel like once we got the sperm it would be such a breeze.

37,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi guys,

I have been on this forum for almost a year now and whilst we have not had success yet I would like to put up a review about 2 Czech clinics that I have been to as I have not seen these clinics reviewed before.

Just a caveat that I live and work in the Czech Republic (CR) and I have VZP health insurance (paid for by my company) and I am using my own eggs and my husbands sperm. In the CR you have 3 x FREE rounds of standard IVF for anyone under 40 (you have to pay extra for things like ICSI/PICSI etc).

I am not going to talk about specifics of my treatment because I think that is individual for everyone, I will be talking about my experience at the clinics.

If anyone ever needs pricing information for these clinics please let me know as I can easily get foreign pricing structures for you.

**Gennet**

https://www.gennet.cz 

Gennet has a very good reputation in the CR and abroad, their facilities are very high tech and they are located in the city centre so travelling is a breeze. 

Since I don't speak Czech I was assigned a coordinator, a coordinator helps you navigate everything and translates anything you don't understand. 

Unfortunately I did not have a very good experience with Gennet. I found the RE I had very rude and dismissive and I had to constantly chase my coordinator to do simple things. She would forget things like checking my insurance which delayed my treatment a few times. 

After my first failed round I asked if we could do anything different with the sperm like PICSI or magnetic sorting and she just dismissed me and said it's just a waste of money (why offer it?).

After my second failed round the RE just wanted me to wait a couple of months and put back my last frozen embryo. I am 35, I wanted to do another round off egg collection. She rudely dismissed this as me trying to get another free round of IVF...like as if I want to go through it again! Then when we talked about different protocols she said she can't do anything different and it's just my body. 

Just to give you an idea of how upset I am with Gennet - I have 1 frozen embryo there and I decided to move to another clinic to do another round of IVF rather than going back to Gennet to use my frozen embryo.

I cannot recommend Gennet and the only reason I did a second round with them is because my husband wanted to give them another chance. The doctors there are arrogant, appointments are rushed and they treat you like a number, they have a good reputation because of great marketing but I did not have a good experience there and a number of people I have spoken to here also feel the same.

**Prague Fertility Centre**

[http://www.pragueivf.com/en/home/](http://www.pragueivf.com/en/home/)

So after my experience with Gennet I decided to be really picky with my next clinic. I made appointments with various clinics and scrutinised the doctors closely.

PFC is slightly outside of the city centre but very easily accessible by public transport (metro and tram), their facilities don't look as high tech as Gennet but nothing bad. They are on the more expensive side of things but they have one of the leading labs in the CR. 

Again because I don't speak Czech I got assigned an English speaking coordinator Mirna. Mirna organised everything for me, she did everything on time for my insurance and really helped me through any hurdle. 

The doctor spent AN HOUR talking to me about previous treatment I had at Gennet, what she would do differently and why. And set me up with a completely different protocol (results were much better and she understands my desire to bank). 

When I got my meds Mirna made the nurses show me exactly how to administer them and she was there to hold my hand through everything.

The day before egg collection my doctor was sick so she personally sent me a text message letting me know that she can't make it but one of the owners of the clinic will be doing the retrieval for me. In the operating theatre the doctor introduced herself and apologised that my doc couldn't make it but that I am in good hands. After egg collection the doctor sends me a text congratulating me on the good result.

On the day of transfer the embryologist came and sat us in a private room with a time-lapse pictures of our embryos and talked us through exactly which embryos they are choosing for transfer and why. 

I am sad to say that my 3rd round has also failed, however I will be continuing my treatment at PFC. I felt like I was treated like a human and I just cannot speak more highly of them. 

TL;DR: Since I've been on these forums I have heard people speaking about ReProfit, Gennet and Zlin, but please consider Prague Fertility Centre if you want to be treated like a human, you'll pay slightly more but it's worth it!",t2_ahphb2i,False,,0,False,IVF Czech Republic - Review: Prague Fertility Centre and Gennet,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8t1klc,False,dark,0.95,,public,35,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,35,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1529705066.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>Gennet has a very good reputation in the CR and abroad, their facilities are very high tech and they are located in the city centre so travelling is a breeze. </p>

<p>Since I don&#39;t speak Czech I was assigned a coordinator, a coordinator helps you navigate everything and translates anything you don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I did not have a very good experience with Gennet. I found the RE I had very rude and dismissive and I had to constantly chase my coordinator to do simple things. She would forget things like checking my insurance which delayed my treatment a few times. </p>

<p>After my first failed round I asked if we could do anything different with the sperm like PICSI or magnetic sorting and she just dismissed me and said it&#39;s just a waste of money (why offer it?).</p>

<p>After my second failed round the RE just wanted me to wait a couple of months and put back my last frozen embryo. I am 35, I wanted to do another round off egg collection. She rudely dismissed this as me trying to get another free round of IVF...like as if I want to go through it again! Then when we talked about different protocols she said she can&#39;t do anything different and it&#39;s just my body. </p>

<p>Just to give you an idea of how upset I am with Gennet - I have 1 frozen embryo there and I decided to move to another clinic to do another round of IVF rather than going back to Gennet to use my frozen embryo.</p>

<p>I cannot recommend Gennet and the only reason I did a second round with them is because my husband wanted to give them another chance. The doctors there are arrogant, appointments are rushed and they treat you like a number, they have a good reputation because of great marketing but I did not have a good experience there and a number of people I have spoken to here also feel the same.</p>

<p><strong>Prague Fertility Centre</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.pragueivf.com/en/home/"">http://www.pragueivf.com/en/home/</a></p>

<p>So after my experience with Gennet I decided to be really picky with my next clinic. I made appointments with various clinics and scrutinised the doctors closely.</p>

<p>PFC is slightly outside of the city centre but very easily accessible by public transport (metro and tram), their facilities don&#39;t look as high tech as Gennet but nothing bad. They are on the more expensive side of things but they have one of the leading labs in the CR. </p>

<p>Again because I don&#39;t speak Czech I got assigned an English speaking coordinator Mirna. Mirna organised everything for me, she did everything on time for my insurance and really helped me through any hurdle. </p>

<p>The doctor spent AN HOUR talking to me about previous treatment I had at Gennet, what she would do differently and why. And set me up with a completely different protocol (results were much better and she understands my desire to bank). </p>

<p>When I got my meds Mirna made the nurses show me exactly how to administer them and she was there to hold my hand through everything.</p>

<p>The day before egg collection my doctor was sick so she personally sent me a text message letting me know that she can&#39;t make it but one of the owners of the clinic will be doing the retrieval for me. In the operating theatre the doctor introduced herself and apologised that my doc couldn&#39;t make it but that I am in good hands. After egg collection the doctor sends me a text congratulating me on the good result.</p>

<p>On the day of transfer the embryologist came and sat us in a private room with a time-lapse pictures of our embryos and talked us through exactly which embryos they are choosing for transfer and why. </p>

<p>I am sad to say that my 3rd round has also failed, however I will be continuing my treatment at PFC. I felt like I was treated like a human and I just cannot speak more highly of them. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Since I&#39;ve been on these forums I have heard people speaking about ReProfit, Gennet and Zlin, but please consider Prague Fertility Centre if you want to be treated like a human, you&#39;ll pay slightly more but it&#39;s worth it!</p>

All of the tips helped me to get through my first biopsy and I want to thank you very much. It was over quickly and it was painful but the meditation, what to expect and music helped a lot. It took a little longer for me to recover it seemed than most people but I dealt with the pain fine. I'm going to leave my previous thread up with all the tips on it from you guys in hopes it helps the next person. 

So... onto the results. :( My fertility treatments are all on hold. I came back with hyperplasia
they want to put me on Provera for three months and then do another biopsy. If it's still not normal I guess we have to do a D&C. If it's normal...? I'm not sure what is next. 

I'm a little heartbroken to have to put my chances for a fertility on hold. I'm so upset that all this time I've needed extra help and my local doctors kept telling me it was my fault that I was not having a child because I was fat. If I hadn't taken the chance to go to a bigger hospital 2 hours away from me... 
Anyway... there is nobody else that is going to know the pain here expect for you guys in this group. I've not told anyone else this situation yet because they are all going to expect me to be strong. I'm NOT STRONG. I'm bawling tears and I'm hurt.

I wasn’t sure if I should post this stand alone or update the other one; I don’t know what the etiquette is, so mods just let me know and I’ll fix it if I need to. 

We made a plan. It was very hasty (we only had 1 day to decide), but it felt right so we went with it.  

We went ahead with this retrieval. My husband and I were both worried we would regret it if we didn’t at least try. Retrieval was yesterday and they got exactly 3 eggs. Bright and early this morning I got the call that 2 were mature and 1 survived ICSI. So we have 1. I have mixed feelings about this. I was hoping for at least 2, but looking at statistics I feel very lucky to even have the 1 considering I only had 3 follicles. 

Originally we were doing frozen transfer, now there is a debate on whether or not to do fresh. I’m waiting on a call back for the answer. 

The second part of this plan is somewhat crazy but doable and until pushed we didn’t even consider it. Plus we hadn’t even had a donor egg talk yet because the RE was thinking this would work. I had been all over the Internet looking at prices on donor eggs cycles and they seemed so far out of our budget. I should have asked my clinic about them myself just to see but I didn’t.  (My clinic is very step by step oriented so I know the donor egg talk would have happened after this stimming cycle if we had decided not to go with the retrieval). I think sometimes with infertility it’s hard and scary to think ahead and plan because from the start until now everything has been so fast and it’s so emotional. And honestly my responses to meds were not what we thought they would be. 

Anyway, I talked to our nurse about donor eggs and got all the info I could. Donor eggs are not quite as out of reach as I thought. So our plan is for the next 6 months to a year we are going to solely live off of my paycheck and put my husbands back into an account to do a donor egg cycle. My clinic offers 2 plans: a 1 egg plan and a 6 egg plan. The good news is the 6 egg plan offers you full money back if you don’t have a baby. The bad news is that it’s $45,000. We are going to shoot for the 6 egg plan, but if we can only get to the 1 egg plan that’s okay too. We have decided that this is our stopping point either way. So if this transfer doesn’t work we will try the donor eggs this time next year and if that doesn’t work we are done.

58,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So I was wondering just how crappy my crappy graded embryos were, and came across this article: 

https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(12)01346-5/abstract#/article/S0015-0282(12)01346-5/fulltext?mobileUi=1

It’s about the impact of inner cell mass (ICM - the first letter in the Gardner embryo morphology grading that most places use) and trophectoderm (TE - the second letter) on success rates.

Anyway, here’s the results section: 

The rates of pregnancy per embryo transfer cycle for ICMs of grades A, B, and C were 45.1% (829/1838), 41.7% (454/1089), and 39.4% (26/66), and abortion rates were 19.8% (164/829), 24.5% (111/454), and 26.9% (7/26) respectively. The ICM grade did not have a statistically significant effect on the rate of pregnancy or abortion. 

In contrast, the rates of pregnancy per embryo transfer cycle for TE grades of A, B, and C were 48.8% (488/1000), 42.4% (786/1853), and 25.0% (35/140), respectively. For grade C TE, the rate of pregnancy was significantly lower than that for TEs of grade A or B (P<0.05). The rates of abortion for TEs of grades A, B, and C were 17.8% (87/488), 23.4% (184/786), and 31.4% (11/35), respectively. Embryos with a grade C TE showed a significantly higher rate of abortion compared with those with a grade A TE (P<0.05).

This article reaches the same conclusion, that TE is more predictive: https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/26/12/3289/2914209

“The main finding of our study was that for blastocysts transferred in human IVF the morphological appearance of TE cells is the most important morphological parameter for predicting live birth outcome.”

And this one as well, though it suggests that maternal age also has an impact on otherwise similarly graded embryos: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3843172/ 

“We found that clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates (Table 3) were significantly predicted by TE morphology, embryo stage and patient age. Inner cell mass morphology was not predictive of either live birth rate (p = 0.2653) nor clinical pregnancy rate (p = 0.9349). Similarly, embryo grade did not predict live birth rate (p = 0.2374) or clinical pregnancy rate (p = 0.0583). Trophectoderm morphology was associated with LB rates of 50 % (good), 41.9 % (fair) and 30 % (poor). Blastocyst stages were associated with LB rates of 50 % (hatching), 49.5 % (expanded) and 36.7 % (early). LB rates in patients <35 years of age remain good across trophectoderm morphology scores.”

But all those studies are from 2011-2013, so I kept looking for something newer, and found this, which is really fascinating, and criticizes most of the previous studies for having tiny n’s of C graded embryos compared to A’s and B’s, and therefore not really being able to say anything about C’s: https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2017/3/hox017/4616124 

(Spoiler: Most of our embryos have C graded trophectoderms, which is why I’m really interested in this) 

Check out this (I think) awesome graph showing the percentages of ICMs and TEs of each grade in each study, sorted by which factor they found most predictive: https://imgur.com/a/lN43Cqt 

Anyway, it looks like there are slightly more studies suggesting TE is most important, but there are also studies that found ICM or stage were more important, and methodological issues may limit the applicability if any of this to embryos with C grades.

So.....🤷🏻‍♀️

Anyway, it was an interesting little journey to take, so thought I’d share, and see if any of y’all have thoughts/knowledge on this as well, since it’s not something I remember seeing discussed on here before. 

ETA: Thanks u/compulsiveplanner08 for sharing this study - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28069172/ - which shows that TE is highly predictive of ploidy status (bad TE = more likely to be aneuploid), but that ICM is more predictive of the success of euploid embryos. ",t2_12uj5n,False,,0,False,ARTICLES: Trophectoderm (TE) grade vs inner cell mass (ICM) grade for selecting blastocysts for embryo transfer,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8sp1yb,False,dark,1.0,,public,19,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,19,,False,self,1529588231.0,,[],{},,True,,1529584813.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So I was wondering just how crappy my crappy graded embryos were, and came across this article: </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(12)01346-5/abstract#/article/S0015-0282(12)01346-5/fulltext?mobileUi=1"">https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(12)01346-5/abstract#/article/S0015-0282(12)01346-5/fulltext?mobileUi=1</a></p>

<p>It’s about the impact of inner cell mass (ICM - the first letter in the Gardner embryo morphology grading that most places use) and trophectoderm (TE - the second letter) on success rates.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s the results section: </p>

<p>The rates of pregnancy per embryo transfer cycle for ICMs of grades A, B, and C were 45.1% (829/1838), 41.7% (454/1089), and 39.4% (26/66), and abortion rates were 19.8% (164/829), 24.5% (111/454), and 26.9% (7/26) respectively. The ICM grade did not have a statistically significant effect on the rate of pregnancy or abortion. </p>

<p>In contrast, the rates of pregnancy per embryo transfer cycle for TE grades of A, B, and C were 48.8% (488/1000), 42.4% (786/1853), and 25.0% (35/140), respectively. For grade C TE, the rate of pregnancy was significantly lower than that for TEs of grade A or B (P&lt;0.05). The rates of abortion for TEs of grades A, B, and C were 17.8% (87/488), 23.4% (184/786), and 31.4% (11/35), respectively. Embryos with a grade C TE showed a significantly higher rate of abortion compared with those with a grade A TE (P&lt;0.05).</p>

<p>This article reaches the same conclusion, that TE is more predictive: <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/26/12/3289/2914209"">https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/26/12/3289/2914209</a></p>

<p>“The main finding of our study was that for blastocysts transferred in human IVF the morphological appearance of TE cells is the most important morphological parameter for predicting live birth outcome.”</p>

<p>And this one as well, though it suggests that maternal age also has an impact on otherwise similarly graded embryos: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3843172/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3843172/</a> </p>

<p>“We found that clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates (Table 3) were significantly predicted by TE morphology, embryo stage and patient age. Inner cell mass morphology was not predictive of either live birth rate (p = 0.2653) nor clinical pregnancy rate (p = 0.9349). Similarly, embryo grade did not predict live birth rate (p = 0.2374) or clinical pregnancy rate (p = 0.0583). Trophectoderm morphology was associated with LB rates of 50 % (good), 41.9 % (fair) and 30 % (poor). Blastocyst stages were associated with LB rates of 50 % (hatching), 49.5 % (expanded) and 36.7 % (early). LB rates in patients &lt;35 years of age remain good across trophectoderm morphology scores.”</p>

<p>But all those studies are from 2011-2013, so I kept looking for something newer, and found this, which is really fascinating, and criticizes most of the previous studies for having tiny n’s of C graded embryos compared to A’s and B’s, and therefore not really being able to say anything about C’s: <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2017/3/hox017/4616124"">https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2017/3/hox017/4616124</a> </p>

<p>(Spoiler: Most of our embryos have C graded trophectoderms, which is why I’m really interested in this) </p>

I just went through my first round of IVF and the numbers all started out good - 30 eggs retrieved, 23 mature, 18 fertilized. We ended up with 9 day 5/6 blasts that were sent out for PGS testing. Just got word that only 1 of them was normal. One was also mosaic (but seemed like potentially down syndrome based on the results, so probably not worth the risk), and one was no results (not enough DNA to test). I guess I should be happy that we got one PGS normal, but this seems abysmal for my age, with no real reason why. Also, oddly my RE said all 9 that were tested were girls - that also seems statistically impossible. My husband was really wanting a boy, but obviously at this point we’d just be happy with a healthy baby, period. 

Now I’m trying to decide what to do. Do you guys think I should do another egg retrieval round now to hopefully get more normals?

UGH, this is just not at all what I was expecting, so I am struggling quite a bit after these results.

<p>&quot;not_doing_that, everyone keeps asking me if the surgery fixed you and you can have kids, no one has asked me how you are doing after surgery, and it&#39;s really irritating that anyone only cares if you can have kids, not how you are&quot;</p>

<p>My response was to laugh and tell him &quot;Yea I know, it&#39;s real annoying everyone only sees me as a walking uterus.&quot;</p>

81,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello. I have seen a few posts on this and we just learned a ton about our mosaic embryo and I wanted to share with you guys. I apologize if this is a repeat discussion.

Last year we did a retrieval and got 5 embryos we sent for PGS testing. 1 normal, 1 mosaic, 1 abnormal \*see clinical notes. We transferred the normal but lost him at 19w (check my post history for more info). We figured we would transfer the mosaic next because we heard that they ""sometimes"" worked. However, this week we had a meeting with the genetic counselor at the PGS testing company. I love her. She sent documents saying the following:

Chromosomal mosaicism, the presence of two or more cell lines within a sample, is known to occur in a minority of embryos at all stages of preimplantation development through errors in mitotic cell divisions following fertilization and various other mechanisms. In an embryo, mosaicism can occur in the (1) trophectoderm (the outer layer of the embryo which becomes the placenta and is the part that is biopsied for PGS); (2) Inner Cell Mass (ICM, the tissue which develops into the fetus/baby); or (3) both the trophectoderm AND inner cell mass. It is not possible to accurately determine the true percentage of mosaicism in an embryo when testing only a few (\~3-8) trophectoderm cells. In addition, if an embryo truly is mosaic, the percentage would depend on which cells in the embryo were actually sampled. Depending on which cells were biopsied, the presence and percentage seen could vary widely. Further, it would not be possible to know if mosaicism would be present in the ICM and, if so, whether the degree of mosaicism in the biopsy would be representative of the degree of mosaicism in the embryo itself.

Embryos deemed mosaic by PGS have the potential to develop into a fetus that is chromosomally normal, chromosomally abnormal, or mosaic to a lesser, greater, or similar degree to that predicted by the biopsy results. The outcome is dependent on the chromosome(s) and amount of genetic material involved, the proportion of abnormal/normal cells, and where the abnormal cells are present (which cell/tissue types and organ systems have the abnormal cells) – all of which are difficult to assess, even postnatally (after birth).

There is limited data regarding the transfer of embryos diagnosed as mosaic, but preliminary data suggests that embryos identified as mosaic have reduced chance of implantation. There have been reports of mosaic embryos being transferred and resulting in live births of reportedly healthy children, but we have no long-term data for these children. Possible outcomes following transfer of a mosaic embryo may also include failed implantation, miscarriage, effects on placental function if pregnancy is achieved and live birth with no/minimal symptoms to significant health/physical/intellectual disabilities. We reviewed that our general recommendation is to not transfer any abnormal embryos.

The Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis International Society (PGDIS) has published suggested guidelines when considering transfer of an embryo found to be mosaic for a whole extra (trisomy) or missing (monosomy) chromosome. But, there are currently no guidelines regarding the transfer of embryos diagnosed as mosaic for segmental/partial aneuploidies (deletions or duplications). There is very little known about outcomes of these embryos due to the individual rarity of each particular segmental gain or loss. The large segmental aneuploidies that are detected via PGS are generally not viable in the non-mosaic state. 

She also provided additional information about our specific duplication. In our case it seems like the severity of the duplication would be very high, and after what we have been through we don't want to have to go through a situation where we find out late that they have significant issues and are forced to make a decision. However, it seems like obtaining information on your specific scenario is a very big factor in determining where to use it or not. 

Also some resources she provided:

An organization called UNIQUE has great patient friendly fact sheet on all sorts of disorders: [https://www.rarechromo.org/disorder-guides](https://www.rarechromo.org/disorder-guides)

This is a link to PGDIS' position statement on mosaicism: [http://www.pgdis.org/docs/newsletter\_071816.html](http://www.pgdis.org/docs/newsletter_071816.html)

And here is a link to a really good patient friendly website on all things fertility/IVF/PGT/etc:  [https://www.fertilityiq.com/courses](https://www.fertilityiq.com/courses)

I have seen a few posts on this and we just learned a ton about our mosaic embryo and I wanted to share with you guys. I apologize if this is a repeat discussion.</p>

<p>Last year we did a retrieval and got 5 embryos we sent for PGS testing. 1 normal, 1 mosaic, 1 abnormal *see clinical notes. We transferred the normal but lost him at 19w (check my post history for more info). We figured we would transfer the mosaic next because we heard that they &quot;sometimes&quot; worked. However, this week we had a meeting with the genetic counselor at the PGS testing company. I love her. She sent documents saying the following:</p>

<p>Chromosomal mosaicism, the presence of two or more cell lines within a sample, is known to occur in a minority of embryos at all stages of preimplantation development through errors in mitotic cell divisions following fertilization and various other mechanisms. In an embryo, mosaicism can occur in the (1) trophectoderm (the outer layer of the embryo which becomes the placenta and is the part that is biopsied for PGS); (2) Inner Cell Mass (ICM, the tissue which develops into the fetus/baby); or (3) both the trophectoderm AND inner cell mass. It is not possible to accurately determine the true percentage of mosaicism in an embryo when testing only a few (~3-8) trophectoderm cells. In addition, if an embryo truly is mosaic, the percentage would depend on which cells in the embryo were actually sampled. Depending on which cells were biopsied, the presence and percentage seen could vary widely. Further, it would not be possible to know if mosaicism would be present in the ICM and, if so, whether the degree of mosaicism in the biopsy would be representative of the degree of mosaicism in the embryo itself.</p>

<p>Embryos deemed mosaic by PGS have the potential to develop into a fetus that is chromosomally normal, chromosomally abnormal, or mosaic to a lesser, greater, or similar degree to that predicted by the biopsy results. The outcome is dependent on the chromosome(s) and amount of genetic material involved, the proportion of abnormal/normal cells, and where the abnormal cells are present (which cell/tissue types and organ systems have the abnormal cells) – all of which are difficult to assess, even postnatally (after birth).</p>

<p>There is limited data regarding the transfer of embryos diagnosed as mosaic, but preliminary data suggests that embryos identified as mosaic have reduced chance of implantation. There have been reports of mosaic embryos being transferred and resulting in live births of reportedly healthy children, but we have no long-term data for these children. Possible outcomes following transfer of a mosaic embryo may also include failed implantation, miscarriage, effects on placental function if pregnancy is achieved and live birth with no/minimal symptoms to significant health/physical/intellectual disabilities. We reviewed that our general recommendation is to not transfer any abnormal embryos.</p>

<p>The Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis International Society (PGDIS) has published suggested guidelines when considering transfer of an embryo found to be mosaic for a whole extra (trisomy) or missing (monosomy) chromosome. But, there are currently no guidelines regarding the transfer of embryos diagnosed as mosaic for segmental/partial aneuploidies (deletions or duplications). There is very little known about outcomes of these embryos due to the individual rarity of each particular segmental gain or loss. The large segmental aneuploidies that are detected via PGS are generally not viable in the non-mosaic state. </p>

<p>She also provided additional information about our specific duplication. In our case it seems like the severity of the duplication would be very high, and after what we have been through we don&#39;t want to have to go through a situation where we find out late that they have significant issues and are forced to make a decision. However, it seems like obtaining information on your specific scenario is a very big factor in determining where to use it or not. </p>

<p>Also some resources she provided:</p>

<p>An organization called UNIQUE has great patient friendly fact sheet on all sorts of disorders: <a href=""https://www.rarechromo.org/disorder-guides"">https://www.rarechromo.org/disorder-guides</a></p>

I am currently gearing up for my first FET in July. After years of egg retrievals (and heartbreak – thanks hunger games) we have three precious PGD/PGS normal embryos. Several month ago I had a PAP, which came back abnormal as I have high risk HPV. Colposcopy was done and came back fine. However, while I was taking Lupron to get ready for my FET, I received a call from my OB/GYN telling me that for quality assurance they retested my sample and it may be abnormal and at the same time they provided the pathology report. The report states ‘acute inflammation present’. Long story short, they wanted me back to test an endometrial biopsy and I suggested to also look into endometritis (because of the inflammation). This all just happened in the past few days and while the sample was taken I was on my cycle. The sample is benign, but they weren’t able to test for endometritis since I was on my cycle and it somehow isn’t possible (why nobody told me that beforehand when I pointed that out...idk…). 

My ER wants to go ahead and do the FET (without retesting for endometritis) and my OB/GYN also thinks there is no need to retest and I shouldn’t be concerned if I don’t have any symptoms. They don’t think antibiotics are necessary. I am still on Lupron and would start patches tomorrow.  

Well I am concerned and I am not sure what to think of this. Has anybody been in a similar situation and has some advise? I’ve read that endometritis decreases the likelihood of a successful FET and with only three embryos I don’t want to risk a failed transfer.

My OBGYN said it was too advanced for her to deal with, so she put me through to a local doctor who has a partnership with a specialist who comes to our city every few months to do complex surgeries like mine. From the pictures, there were a lot of adhesions, my uterus was in a tight ball with my ovaries stuck behind it and not visible. I had some endo lesions on my bowels. Also my tubes were tested with chromopertubation and they were not able to get any of the dye through. I was devastated.

Meanwhile, I got in touch with an IVF clinic because the waitlist for funding can be long, and I love my doctor so far. She gave me an AMH test and found my results were 'low average' but trusted this surgeon to be careful in preserving ovarian tissue.

I thought my surgery was this Friday... but it turns out the surgeon can't make it and I'm crushed. I was looking forward to knowing if the surgery would unblock my tubes or not.

Now I am reconsidering; should I just go for IVF and to heck with the surgery? Since there are risks to my ovarian reserve, and it's already on the lower side, maybe I should just try to do IVF and stop dreaming of doing it 'the natural' way? Or at least do a retrieval first just in case?

Anyone with endo who's had surgery then IVF, or skipped the surgery and just gone straight to IVF have any feedback? Pros, cons, stats? Should I just ask my IVF doctor what she thinks? I'd even like to hear about people with endo who had blocked tubes and surgery/something else fixed it?

87,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello, I am new to the forum after reading for quite a while. 

I am a just turned 33 year old female. I have suffered from anorexia in the past, but have since recovered. I first started trying to conceive with my husband when I turned 30. We struggled to conceive. After one year of trying we decided to seek help with a fertility specialist. We both underwent every test in our pre-fertility treatment journey. Everything was normal except my FSH was very low at the time (0.7). HSG normal, AMH, estradiol, AFC lower end of normal, progesterone, LH, CBC etc. all normal besides low FSH. Only other notable medical conditions are a retroverted uterus (not from PID, endometriosis, or any other common culprit from what my OB and fertility doctors could tell) and a sleep disorder (insomnia coupled with circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder - can't take recommended medication for this when you are trying to conceive; melatonin has extremely minimal impact even when cycled) I have had for over 15 years. We decided to wait until the calendar year rolled over to begin our treatments because while we have a very good insurance that covers 4 IVF treatments per year, we have a $6500 deductible. It didn't make sense to us to start fertility treatments with less than 4 months left in a calendar year (which would have maxed out deductible with the cost we were told for IUI's at $1000 each plus medicines) only to have to do the deductible again the next year when we started IVF. Waiting for the year to roll over, my husband and I conceived naturally after 16 months. There were no medical complications.

My husband and I started trying to conceive again 6 months ago. I was told by my doctor that due to my previous infertility diagnosis, I should not wait a year this time and only 6 months, similar to what women over 35 are told. Since it is early in the calendar year we intend to start fertility treatments with my next cycle with the same fertility clinic we had previously sought out treatment with. My FSH was 5.2 and AMH was 3.65 this time around, thyroid mid-low normal. I have not received back my other results yet.

I guess I have a lot of questions about what to expect. Has anyone suffering from primary or secondary infertility had success with IUI alone? Could my previous anorexia have permanently damaged my eggs leading to poor quality? I never lost my periods, and was never severely underweight. Would this show up on any of the fertility tests they run outside of IVF when they look at blastocyte quality? What kind of variance is there between the time between IUI cycles and IVF cycles (meaning have some women done IUI back to back months where others have to wait multiple cycles? Same for IVF). Our fertility doctor said the norm was 3 cycles of IUI and then IFV because they feel if it isn't successful after 3, it likely won't be. I have seen many women with far higher IUI numbers. Is this a medical or financial reason most of the time? Should I ask them to test for any kind of cervical fluid problems that could be possible? This has never been brought up by my OB or our fertility doctors, but is listed as a possible reason for unexplained infertility.

I know many here will not be sympathetic to me and I understand, but I feel very consumed, overwhelmed and alone in all of this. I am eternally grateful for what I have. I feel like a failure that I am struggling with infertility again, I wonder if I did this to myself, I go through bouts of crippling despair where I have to silently cry in the bathroom. Of course any time we go out, I see families with multiple children or pregnant women everywhere. I'm both excited and terrified to start fertility treatments. I have hope for once feeling like maybe this will be the magic answer, but at the same time worry that maybe nothing can help me and I just had the 0.01% chance work out sporadically in the past never to be repeated. For those who are ending their infertility journey, how long did you work with fertility doctors for before deciding enough was enough? What was the reason (i.e age)? I spend my nights obsessively researching anything I can grasp at as a possible explanation or solution to ask my doctors about.

I feel like I am struggling through this alone a lot of the time. My husband flat out calls me stupid when I express my worries of infertility citing previous natural success (albeit after 16 months at a younger age). He believes we shouldn't even consider fertility treatment until a year has passed, despite both my OB and fertility doctors agreeing that 6 months is a safer bet given previous struggles. I know I am not in the worst ship by any means, but it becomes harder each cycle that we fail as I am constantly reminded of our past infertility worrying about a future I feel I have absolutely no control over. It is terrifying to feel as though you cannot shape your own life and you are helpless in your own body. Maybe it is a case of the grass is always greener, but the unexplained aspect is so hard to deal with. I am a mathematics researcher, and am not used to such complete unknown with literally no direction to even look in to grasp for an answer.

I am a mathematics researcher, and am not used to such complete unknown with literally no direction to even look in to grasp for an answer. When there is no answer in sight it feels so much more hopeless. Although perhaps if something definable is wrong I will wish I had stayed ignorant to it, especially if it is something which fertility treatments cannot overcome.</p>

It seems that we have had another big turnover of users here in r/infertility. We are always glad to see members graduate, and to welcome new users in to the fold. However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.

**Mention of pregnancy/ positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread.**

Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C"". **Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules.** This is to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Sometimes mentions of children/pregnancy is painful. **Unsolicited mentions does include flair** - a reminder to keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality.

I am on a government funded list to begin IVF as soon as ""full"" period arrives. Problem is, my periods are weird and often last 9-10 days with very mild bleeding until 3 days before the end. I don't know when in my period would count as a legitimate part. 

I've brought up these long, low-flow periods before to many doctors and nurses along the way but none have seemed concerned and all my hormone tests and physical tests appear normal. 

So, anyone else here with long light periods know when it's ""full""?

Also, I work 5 days a week, 8 hour shifts, varying from starting at 7:45 am to 11 pm to starting at even 3:30 pm. I'm worried that the IVF process will interfere with my job. I am unsure if I should disclose what I am doing to my Manager so that she can adequately prepare. (The schedules are made x2 weeks in advance) I am an Assistant Manager. My position is important. 

I have no choice in when I can do my IVF treatment. I was put on a waiting list and the clinic basically told me that refusing the date given to me will make it seem like I don't put importance on it when hundreds of other women desperately want that funded treatment. I am not worried about losing my job. I've been there over 10 years and am reliable. I just don't want to ""screw them over"".

When does ERA recommend on doing other biopsy? If ERA results are so accurate, why do people do second biopsy(did ERA not provide any recommendation)?

I have been perusing the internet as my husband and I are trying with a RE again after taking about 4 years off. I stumbled upon the group and knew it was for me when I read the rules about no ""cutesy"" acronyms :)

A little about me - 33, PCOS, TTC for about 6 years. Have been on medical hiatus since July 4, 2013 due to a major OHSS episode that landed me in the hospital for 3 days after 6 failed clomid and clomid/follistim cycles (the one min-stem cycle caused the OHSS). Luckily there was no lasting physical damage, but it caused a lot of emotional trauma. I was working with a gyno at the time and, honestly, feel like they were totally incompetent. When I went to the ER I was told by the ER doctor that what I was experiencing was ""ovulation pain"" (it was severe OHSS - my ovaries were the size of grapefruits). When I was admitted to the hospital, apparently he wrote ""female troubles"" and this is what was submitted to my insurance (not even kidding, it was such a disaster). After all that, I questioned whether I wanted to go through this again. During the time that we've been trying, several of my friends and family members have had kids (yes, multiple) and I can't help but feel pissed, jealous, and bitter about this whole situation.

That brings us to now. I've found a new RE and we are are trying IUI and letrozol and are on our first cycle. We only get 3 IUI cycles with the letrozole before we have to move on to IVF (I still don't understand why that is - but that is another post). I'm honestly feeling pretty discouraged. I have minimal insurance coverage and a boat load of student loans (law school) so the thought of paying $15k up front for IVF makes me sick. Has anyone else dealt with severe OHSS? What did you do after? Any tips for shopping around for IVF if it comes to that?

First retrieval was canceled due to only having 2 follicles. I was on 225 gonal f and 75 menopur. We converted to IUI and it obviously didn’t work. 

This time I’m on 150 menopur and 300 follistim. This time there are only 3 follicles. When I talked to the RE he basically wanted to move forward with retrieval this time. He said he didn’t see me doing any better with another round of meds. 

I had bloodwork and ultrasound this morning (day 8) still only 3 follicles but they are growing well.  When the nurse called she said we may want to think about converting again. Now I’m confused. The RE made me feel like we could still get something from only having 3 follicles but the nurse is acting like it’s better to convert to IUI again. 

This is a huge decision. The way my clinic works is that you pay everything up front. Basically until you make it to retrieval you don’t have to pay again if meds don’t work.  So  I didn’t have to pay again for the second round of ultrasounds and bloodwork because we never made it to retrieval the first stimming cycle.  If we go to retrieval with only 3 follicles all our money is gone. If we get nothing then we have to start over paying for everything. It was $15,000 without meds. We could do another round of meds and not be out anymore money. 

The RE acted like it would be okay but the nurse does not. We were going to go ahead with retrieval but now I don’t know anymore. This is our only shot at this.  We don’t have another $15,000 to give them. 

What would you do in the situation? Has anyone been in this situation and had a good outcome? Are 3 follicles even close to being good enough to go through with this? I know they say it only takes one but after 4 IUIs, one canceled retrieval and now this, I don’t know that one of my eggs will be good enough (if they even get one).

My current clinic is the only one in the state that reports to the CDC.  Ive heard mixed reviews on the clinic and several have suggested going to a new fertility clinic at the state's University med school / hospital (typically state of the art hospital). That apparently, a new awesome doctor was there and many were switching over.  I’ll spare you the long details, but I decided to at least schedule a consult with her to get a second opinion…I cant get in until the end of July and will probably start my first IVF round before then.

But here’s the deal:  I've researched her....this chick has written books, done countless tv interviews, presents herself as an expert in the RE field….but the last time she published success data was in 2006.

I'm a nurse and researcher at the University of Missouri.  My friend Rusen Ozturk is a nurse and fertility researcher and all-around nice person from Turkey, here  for a postdoctoral fellowship. For her postdoc research, she is collecting data on reproductive health, stress, social support, and relationship issues for women of childbearing age (20-45; including women with and without primary or secondary infertility, pregnancy loss, and trouble conceiving.)  Because her time here is pretty short, she has made an online survey. 

This survey is online, short (less than 25 minutes), and completely anonymous.  It has been approved by the University of Missouri IRB (Project # 2011077).  The moderators of this group have kindly allowed us to share it here with you. 

If you are a woman between 20 and 45, will you please consider helping Rusen with her survey?  And if you have feedback on ways to improve the survey questions, please share the with us? (Here, or you can contact us directly).  The survey was reviewed by healthcare providers who work in fertility clinics (and some have had some experience with infertility treatment themselves), but designing good surveys is always challenging.

Thanks so much.  On a personal note, I want to add that we appreciate the r/infertility community.

However, I’m also seeing the opposite on other sites, including at least one fertility center - saying to *avoid * salt because it makes bloat worse. And most general (not IVF-related) advice I can find says high salt worsens bloat. 

I thinking post-ER bloat may be different than regular bloat because it has a different source. But I’m still not clear on what the deal is with salt.

I first called Seattle Reproductive Medicine, and they were super rude to me from the start. I didn't even get to book an appointment before I was ready to tear up. I called my OB and she suggested PNW Fertility. Also, SRM's preferred hotels where you supposedly get a discount stopped offering the discount years ago.

Seattle is cheap enough to fly to, but all the lodging there is so expensive. Portland amd LA can be just as affordable to fly to, and even Chicago can be super affordable, plus I have a ton of friends there from college.

I already have an intake appointment with Pacific Northwest Fertility, but so many of the Portland area clinics got better reviews. The lady I made the intake appointment with was super friendly, so I have no complaints so far.

Everything says to compare IVF success rates, but I'm skeptical of the statistics because they can categorize and summarize data in the most favorable ways. 


I'm just really struggling with feeling like I'm making foolish decisions. There are so many options and extra complications-- like flights, lodging, car rentals, Ubers, dog sitters, and so on that can add a lot of cost to an already expensive procedure.

I'm not complaining about having to pay for IVF. They use a lot of crazy advanced equipment and techniques. I'm just worried that I'm choosing a ridiculously expensive city by choosing Seattle over Portland. Hell, for what Seattle is going to cost, I could go to Spain, stay in a nice hotel for two whole weeks, and pay for IVF for basically the same cost.

4 failed IUIs, over $20,000 in out of pocket expenses for testing and medication just to get to this point where money is officially tight. I'm struggling with feeling like we don't have the resources for this. For 4+ years, we've talked and talked about a cabin or an RV or a tropical vacation. There are so many other things we could be doing with this money. We've both got bucket lists a mile long. Starting a family is definitely on that list, but we are going to be anywhere from $30k to $50k into this process soon... With no guarantee that there will be a family greater than 2 at the end. We could make a few dozen other items on our bucket lists happen before then.

They said they don&#39;t use frozen sperm... So fucking frustrated. This is shit. cause of infertility: one blocked tube.</p>

It was actually my bf or 3+ years who suggested freezing embryos and using them later for ivf when we get married.

Normal IVF started when I was 35 and the first 2 times took, but ended in miscarriages (10 weeks and 17 weeks). A surprising spontaneous pregnancy ended at 19 weeks due to the baby having an unbalanced translocation, as well as numerous other issues. This was prior to us discovering his balanced translocation.

Eventually we were approved for PGD and have gone through 4 rounds, resulting in 3 ""healthy"" embryos, meaning that they either carry his balanced translocation, or lack it completely. FISH was used as the analysis method, so we have no idea if the embryos carried any other genetic/chromosomal anomalies. The first fresh implant resulted in no pregnancy, while the second ended in a really early miscarriage (I got a plus on the pregnancy test, but blood tests showed that my levels were very low and I had already started bleeding.).

I am now 39, soon to be 40 and am wondering why it was so easy for the previous embryos to take and these seem impossible. A few things that I am curious about. I have a fairly regular period that, of course, has been affected by the countless attempts. However, for the past 2 transfers, we have used estrogen pills from day 3 of my period and 5 days forward followed by an ultrasound to check the lining and finally, a shot to induce ovulation. I wonder if this could play any role in my success.

In addition, I have noticed that after transfer, or what I believe is after transfer as I don't remember 100% when it starts, but I develop somewhat of a cold. It starts with a runny nose and then coughing.

Our next avenue is embryo donation. We have looked at various clinics, primarily in the Czech Republic, Spain, and Russia, as they have money-back guarantees and/or a very good reputation. Are there any clinics in the USA or elsewhere that I should look into that offer a money-back guarantee should the embryo donation fail?

- Meditation - occasionally helps, sometimes hurts, but usually doesn't really change my mood.
- Yoga - often helps, but not allowed much of the time during IVF cycles. Plus, I managed to injure my knee a few months ago, so my ability to do it is now even more limited.
- Walks - don't really help most of the time. Sometimes, make me more frustrated. Plus, every time I go outside now, I see hoards of pregnant women, babies, and toddlers, which I try to spin as ""hope,"" but that doesn't always work.
- Therapy - I seem to be hitting a wall here. The summary of my sessions (and I've tried more than one therapist) is ""it's supposed to be bad, so your feelings are normal - they won't last forever."" That advice may work for a sprint, but not for a multi-year marathon.
- Talking to friends/family - most of them don't understand what this is like, because they haven't been through it, and often times, they say things that are well-meaning, but infuriating.

Any tips you can share on how to endure this and keep your sanity would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

232,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all! I'm following up on a prior thread -- regarding a survey link that was posted. I can't find the thread by searching and I think it was deleted -- either by the original poster (my research colleague) or by the mods. 

My name is Dr. Tina Bloom, and I'm at the University of Missouri (if you want to look me up/ drop me a line there).  I'm a nurse, and a maternal-child health researcher, but my area is really more about women's stressors and priorities for support and about violence prevention --  not so much infertility. My colleague Dr. Rusen Ozturk is visiting from Turkey and doing a post doc here. This is her survey. She is an Infertility researcher, but obviously in a very different context than the US.

She cares deeply about the issues women face with infertility.  She's gotten some funding from the Turkish government to study abroad and expand her knowledge of research methods and infertility in other cultures. She posted a link to her survey for women living with infertility posted last week. The thread is gone, but people in this group made some SUPER helpful comments regarding things in the survey that weren't working, could be offensive or hurtful, and/or were missing.  

 I really wanted to thank you for all of your helpful comments and feedback here.  And I wanted to let people we will include all of them. This process has been unique for me (she is my first postdoc).  Normally, when I am preparing to do my own survey of a population of women I don't usually work with, I would start with focus groups and interviews to make sure that we are really asking about the right things, and doing it in the right way. 

That's not always how research works, but it's how I was trained, and I think this is so important, because I firmly believe women are the experts in their own lives.  However, interviews and focus groups require time, and money, which she doesn't really have. Rusen is only here for a very short period of time, and she doesn't have money to pay participants. So we have had to adapt my usual process to that. And what we have done instead is reviewed the published literature in this area to develop the survey -- and also we sent her survey around to a group of subject matter experts who are primarily healthcare providers working in infertility.  

Mostly these experts were women, and some had prior experience of their own with infertility and with infertility treatment.  But we clearly missed some things.  For example, Rusen used a standard, widely-used three-question ""fertility stigma"" scale, which is mostly questions about people judging women for their infertility. The feedback in this group was that this wasn't a typical experience -- that where women experience judgmental attitudes, shitty free advice, etc is around infertility DECISION-MAKING -- treatment, adoption, etc.  That is clearly so, SO important and is great feedback. But that isn't really something that you see talked about in the research literature, and it clearly isn't something that was on our healthcare provider/subject matter experts' radar either --  so we missed it entirely.  But you can be assured it is something we WILL add questions to the survey about now.

We will also fix the other glitches that you all have pointed out, because these are also extremely important. We still have the time and ability to do that, as she is just getting started. All this underscores for me that there's no substitute for including the voices of women when you're developing research about them.  And I really want to say here so emphatically that I am incredibly grateful for these comments and feedback.

Rusen aims to survey women of childbearing age between 20 and 45. She's including both infertile and fertile women (those who have had a baby before and aren't experiencing secondary infertility) and asking about stress, social support, and relationship conflict and violence. (Women get somewhat different questions in the survey depending on answers, so it is tailored and not endlessly long).  That choice (to include fertile women in a study about infertile women) may sound a little strange, but we know that regardless of fertility status, many women deal with stress, inadequate social support and/or relationship violence. We just don't have a clear understanding of if and how infertility intersects with these issues, makes them better or worse, or what women who are dealing with infertility see as their priorities are in terms of support, help, and resources.  (So having comparison data from similar women who aren't dealing with infertility is also helpful.). Very little research has been done on these issues for women living with infertility, which was something that really surprised me and bummed me out. How can we support women if we just focus entirely on the medical side of their experience?

So, TL,DR: 1 million thanks for your helpful comments, and we will fix the survey to include them all.

And I would really welcome any other thoughts or comments you have on other questions that are important to ask, things we may have missed, or We're doing or topics you saw in the survey that may have seemed offensive or poorly worded. You won't hurt my feelings, and you will help us make the survey better. We closed it down for now so we could address the revisions that you have suggested, but I'm happy to open it back up and share the link here if you'd like to take another look and see what you think.

My husband and I are currently working with a real estate agent to buy our first home. We have some time, and our ~deadline~ of sorts is October/November. 

I'm having some difficulty answering my realitor's questions about how many bedrooms/bathrooms we need, etc.

I had always imagined having 2 bathrooms, one for us and one for the kids. I also imagined having enough bedrooms for 2-3 kids + a true guest room or office space. However, now that the future of our family is so unknown, I just don't know. I don't want to have a 4-5 bedroom house if it's just going to be my husband and I. I don't want the constant reminder of those empty rooms.  

On a similar note, we always thought a big yard would be important for kids to be able to play in, and to have a high fence for privacy. However, again, it's a very real possibility that none of these requirements are in our future. 

Same thing goes for houses in neighborhoods that have HOAs with playgrounds, pools, etc. Maybe that would be a perk, maybe just a painful reminder. 

Has anybody else been in this position of house hunting while going through infertility? If so, I would appreciate any advice or words of wisdom.

I found an early study by Capalbo et al. (2014) that claimed that if an embryo was tested normal/euploid, the embryo grading was not predictive of success. This made me feel better and like I should not worry about my grading.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578475](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578475)  


However, I then found a more recent study by Irani et al. (2017) refuting the earlier study and, using better research methods and a large sample, finding a strong relationship between embryo grading and success (ongoing pregnancy rate, and odds of miscarriage).

For comparison, for an 'excellent' embryo, I'd have an 84.2&#37; chance. The study also tells me that for an average embryo, I have an 11.3&#37; chance of miscarrying in the 1st trimester.

I’ve really appreciated what a great community and resource you all are for learning and not feeling alone in this, even just as a reader, so glad to join you officially.

In the midst of my first IVF now, and it’s looking like retrieval will be this Tuesday or Wednesday. Historically, retrievals have only been done at one of the various local offices, but I learned at monitoring this morning that one of the offices closer to me JUST started doing retrievals and transfers this past Monday (this is at Shady Grove in the DC area if that matters).  Apparently we’ll have a choice of which location to use, and I’m kind of at a loss. Some of the thoughts running through my head are:

*I know what the success rates are at the original location, but there’s no info yet for this new location. This is my primary concern, particularly since we will also need to do any subsequent frozen transfers at the same location.

*If they just started doing retrievals/embryology/transfers last week, should I be worried about if they have any kinks in their process worked out?

*Are these brand new staff/embryologists at the new location or are they well-trained staff who came over from the other location?

*If this is a new facility, maybe they have newer, more state-of-the-art equipment?

*The new location is at least 30 mins closer to us, depending on traffic. When we did IUIs at the old location, they still had my husband provide his sample at home. I’m assuming that will be the case for IVF as well (they haven’t given us any detail about this part yet officially though). Maybe we should consider the new, closer location so there is less time for sperm to die off in the car?

My husband and I have been trying since July 2016, and we’ve done 4 unmonitored letrozole cycles, three IUIs and now a false start to our first IVF. My AMH is 2.56, AFC of 22, FSH 7.7, LH 5.4.

My ultrasound after four days of stims showed four follicles 11-13mm and several smaller ones (I didn’t get estrogen levels or total follicle counts).  I began cetrotide the following morning after 5 days of stims. I went for an ultrasound today that showed the same four growing (with one additional smaller one) but they had grown to 15-20mm.

I spoke to Cornerstone Pharmacy about using multidose vials of Gonal F (if you're not aware, the 450iu multidose contains 600iu = 150iu of overfill). Here's my updated pricing:

Menopur 75iu (18 vials) \+ Gonal F 450iu (5 multidose vials) \+ Gonal F 75iu (2 vials) \+ Ovidrel (2 pens) = **$**37**75**

***!!!By switching to multi dose vials and using their overfill, I have saved $525!!!***

If you're nervous about using vials or overfill, keep in mind: it's the same system as Menopur, which has no overfill. If you can use Menopur, you can use Gonal F multidose vials.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Hi friends \-\-

I'm pricing out my medications based on this wonderful spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uZ3albB8AGsu\-A4J5Ox4P2iMUT9jIltVyvlI73AYR5g/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uZ3albB8AGsu-A4J5Ox4P2iMUT9jIltVyvlI73AYR5g/edit#gid=0)

and wanted to update on the lowest prices I found from a few pharmacies.

**Northridge Plaza Pharmacy (Northridge, CA (818) 998\-8700):**

Menopur 75iu: 75.99/vial

Gonal F 300iu: 285.80/pen

Ovidrel: 91.95/pen

= \~$4410

**Cornerstone Pharmacy (Pennsylvania, 215\-706\-2001):**

They bundle, not necessarily for a certain amount, but when you call for pricing they apply whatever discounts they can and bundle individually. Here's my bundle:

Menopur 75iu (18 vials) \+ Gonal F 300iu (10 pens) \+ Ovidrel (2 pens) = $4300

They also offer free overnight shipping, except when they ship Fri\-Sat, which is $35.

I also need to get a microdose lupron (same day delivery in NYC):

**Metro Drugs (New York, 212\-794\-7200)**

Microdose lupron: $129.99

Same day delivery in the city if placed before 11 AM, delivery between 12\-5PM

**Kings Pharmacy (New York, 212\-534\-6000)**

Microdose lupron: $179.99

Yet it would be really nice to go the traditional route.   Do you folks have any experience with this? Am I jumping the gun in my thought process here? 

UPDATE 1 week later: I saw my RE to discuss the plan for the cycle with injectibles should this one fail.  He didn't bring up IUI at first, but when I asked, he quickly said that for women with endo, it can increase success rates.  I asked about what more it would entail and it really only involves 1 more appointment...the actual insemination. BUT there are also more blood tests for both me and my husband and he has to do another SA before the actual IUI.  After weighing pros and cons, I'm leaning towards the IUI.  Like many of you said, if you're going through all that, might as well give it all you've got. Here's my list (with humor added) just in case it helps someone down the line: 
PROS: 5%-10% increase in chance of success, greater success rates with endo than TI, sperm are washed and put exactly where they belong, we will know more if it doesn't work, we will have baby if it does work, it's already covered by insurance, if this isn't going to work I want to know that already!, husband actually will have to participate in the embarrassment!, we can still do TI and pretend that that's how we made a baby
CONS: husband will have to participate in the embarrassment, MORE needle pokes for testing, extra appointment, awkwardness of laying there for 5 minutes with a catheter to make sure things ""stay put"", what if they mix up sperm samples?!

Yet it would be really nice to go the traditional route.   Do you folks have any experience with this? Am I jumping the gun in my thought process here? </p>

<p>UPDATE 1 week later: I saw my RE to discuss the plan for the cycle with injectibles should this one fail.  He didn&#39;t bring up IUI at first, but when I asked, he quickly said that for women with endo, it can increase success rates.  I asked about what more it would entail and it really only involves 1 more appointment...the actual insemination. BUT there are also more blood tests for both me and my husband and he has to do another SA before the actual IUI.  After weighing pros and cons, I&#39;m leaning towards the IUI.  Like many of you said, if you&#39;re going through all that, might as well give it all you&#39;ve got. Here&#39;s my list (with humor added) just in case it helps someone down the line: 
PROS: 5%-10% increase in chance of success, greater success rates with endo than TI, sperm are washed and put exactly where they belong, we will know more if it doesn&#39;t work, we will have baby if it does work, it&#39;s already covered by insurance, if this isn&#39;t going to work I want to know that already!, husband actually will have to participate in the embarrassment!, we can still do TI and pretend that that&#39;s how we made a baby
CONS: husband will have to participate in the embarrassment, MORE needle pokes for testing, extra appointment, awkwardness of laying there for 5 minutes with a catheter to make sure things &quot;stay put&quot;, what if they mix up sperm samples?! (I know, I know...this like never happens...but still)</p>

I just met with another RE at the same clinic. He said they don't do IVF for less than 3 follicles, and he doubts I'll ever get that many. Got the donor speech. 

Since I'm going out of the country for a couple of weeks in June, he recommended an unmonitored Letrozole cycle, currently on CD 4.

My fiance and I are 23, fiance had cancer last year (he is in remission now), he did 6 rounds of chemo, he is sterile because of the chemo. He has normal count but 0&#37; morphology. We will be using his sperm that he froze before chemo which has 118million count, \>90&#37; motility and morphology. We will need to do ICSI because we have very limited good sperm (1 vial). I have no known issues but haven't gotten any tests done so that might not be the case. 

Anyways, we are both struggling with knowing we need IVF. We have known for a while and I've come to terms with the procedure itself but we both want to start right away even though before we knew about it we wanted to wait until June of next year (about a year after getting married) to start trying. We have been talking about it and we are both pretty sure the only reason we want to start now is to know we CAN have a baby, like that proof we need for it to be okay, which is obviously not a good reason to have a child and we don't plan on acting on it. Its just something we haven't gotten over yet. I know we should have pretty good odds, but we both worry about it a lot.

So, my RE recommended doing the high side of 5 days 15 hours, which would be 6 additional hours of progesterone.</p>

<p>Here is my question: I do not want to do a third FET with the same protocol and expect a different result. If this were you, would the 6 additional hours of progesterone exposure be enough of a “change” for you to try again? </p>

I'm over 40, no children so far. I found out on Saturday that my second donor egg FET failed. Not even a chemical pregnancy, it just failed. So I took the day off work to day drink and ponder where this all went so f-ing wrong.
Just a brief background: trying to conceive for three and a half years. Three IVF egg retrievals from December 2016 to September 2017. Results were a six week miscarriage (trisomy 9), a chemical pregnancy and the third had nothing PGS normal to transfer. I had one frozen transfer from retrieval #1, but that resulted in a chemical.
Out of money for futile efforts, I saved and borrowed for donor eggs. From the donor cycle, I got 5 PGS normals from and have transferred two (individually) so far. The first PGS transfer was a chemical, the second was a complete failure (not even a chemical) 
I'm absolutely gutted because the two fails were my only male embryos.
Now, I have three embryo left and money is very much an issue. Only after a pushy email from me, the doctor is interested in scheduling an ERA. 
My question for y'all is: when do you decide to move on to another doctor? Should I expect my doctor to be more proactive?
